{"id": "2024_03_12_success_equal-pay-day-2024", "text": "March 12 marks Equal Pay Day in the United States, a symbolic date representing the number of days women have to work into the current year just to make the same amount of money men made in the prior one. Put another way, to make 12 months\u2019 worth of a man\u2019s median wages, a woman has to work about 14.5 months. In dollars and cents, for every dollar a man earns, a woman is paid 84 cents, according to the National Committee on Pay Equity and the Equal Pay Today campaign. That\u2019s based on earnings data for full-time, year-round workers from the US Census in 2022, which was the most recent full-year data set available. If part-time workers and those not employed year-round are included, the gender pay gap is worse, at 78 cents on the dollar, said Deborah Vagins, national campaign director of Equal Rights Advocates and director of Equal Pay Today. The size of the actual wage gap between men and women will widen or narrow depending on age, level of education, choice of occupation and tenure, as well as race and ethnicity. The gender pay gap is typically widest when comparing the earnings of White men to Black, Hispanic or Native American women. And, generally speaking, the gap is narrower in a given job when men and women are in their early- to mid-20s (i.e., when they are new to the workforce and before children come along), and also when comparing wages by title, tenure and education level within a given field. But no matter how you slice and dice the data, there are very few scenarios in which women on average earn the same as men. Indeed, in its latest analysis of median weekly earnings last year by occupation, the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research found that women earned less than men not only in all 20 of the largest occupations for men but also in all 20 of the largest occupations for women. Among the largest occupations for women, the most egregious pay gaps were among financial managers (women earned 71% of every dollar a man earns), retail salesperson (72%), education and child care administrators (79%), administrative assistants (80%) and managers (81%). The narrowest gap was among cashiers, where women almost have pay parity (98%) with their male colleagues. Same old (and annoying) story every year While the overall gender pay gap has been narrowing over time \u2014 for example, Equal Pay Day in 2005 was April 19, a full five weeks later than this year\u2019s \u2014 the very fact that \ufeffsuch a gap exists at all in 2024 is a reminder that employers and society still have work to do in recognizing the value of women\u2019s contributions at work. \u201cThe gender wage gap is a national disgrace,\u201d said\u00a0Jamila Taylor, IWPR\u2019s president and CEO, in a statement. \u201cEven in professions typically dominated by women, men earn more for doing the same job. Equal pay for equal work has been the law of the land for more than a half-century, yet\u00a0women still cannot get fair treatment when it comes to employment and earnings. And it\u2019s worse for women of color, who face rampant racial discrimination in the workforce in addition to ongoing pay inequities.\u201d The good news is that there are now multiple efforts that may over time help reduce the problem. They include an increasing number of state-level pay transparency laws and bans on employers asking job candidates for their salary histories, which can help chronically underpaid women gain more of an equal footing when they apply for new jobs. There is also now a ban on federal government agencies asking job candidates\u2019 for their salary history and a proposed rule that would prohibit federal contractors from doing the same, as well as requiring them to post in their job ads the pay for given positions. But Vagins and others in the campaign for equal pay also want to see action at the federal legislative level, supporting two bills: the Salary Transparency Act and the Paycheck Fairness Act, which have been introduced in the US House and Senate multiple times. For instance, the Paycheck Fairness Act would, according to Equal Pay Today, \u201cbar retaliation against workers who voluntarily discuss or disclose their wages; close loopholes that have allowed employers to pay women less than men for the same work \u2026 [and] ensure women can receive the same robust remedies for sex-based pay discrimination that are currently available to those subjected to discrimination based on race and ethnicity.\u201d Absent such federal laws requiring all employers to make equal pay more of an imperative, Vagins said, achieving true pay parity for women will be slow in coming.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/12/success/equal-pay-day-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/01/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_06_30_cars_cdk-outage-car-dealers", "text": "As the ongoing systems outage at software provider CDK Global stretches into its second week, car dealerships are racking up millions of dollars in losses, according to a new estimate. Workers across the US automotive industry told CNN that the software blackout, which the company said was caused by a cyberattack, has made it difficult for dealers to track customer interactions, orders and sales, hurting their ability to earn a living. \u201cIt\u2019s going to affect payroll here,\u201d said Bernard Irvin, a salesperson at a Ford dealership in Greenville, South Carolina. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I receive my normal pay? I don\u2019t really understand what this is all about.\u201d The workers\u2019 concerns illustrate how a cyberattack,\u00a0even one on something as overlooked as record-keeping and scheduling software, can cripple an entire industry. According to an estimate by Anderson Economic Group, CDK\u2019s system collapse could result in approximately $944 million in direct losses due to business interruptions for affected car dealers if the outage lasts a full three weeks. Piecemeal progress The outage began last Wednesday after two cyber incidents halted the company\u2019s systems, which provide software to nearly 15,000 car dealerships across North America, according to CDK. In a statement on Friday, the company said it was making progress in bringing some dealerships back online. Previously, the company said it did not expect the issue to be entirely resolved until July. \u201cWe have successfully brought two small groups of dealers and one large publicly traded dealer group live on the Dealer Management System (DMS). We are also actively working to bring live additional applications \u2014 including our Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and Service solutions \u2014 and our Customer Care channels,\u201d according to a CDK spokesperson. \u201cWe understand and share the urgency for our customers to get back to business as usual, and we will continue providing updates as more information is available.\u201d Dozens of automotive retail workers expressed concern about how the outage affected their livelihoods. \u201cI work at a major body shop, and it has really hurt us,\u201d one worker wrote to CNN about the outage. \u201cI don\u2019t know how we\u2019re going to get paid.\u201d \u2018It\u2019s going to affect payroll\u2019 At 71, Norm Phillips has worked as a car parts delivery driver at both a Mercedes-Benz dealership and a Honda dealership in New Jersey for more than 21 years. Since CDK\u2019s malfunction, he hadn\u2019t been able to work at all. The dealerships had not been able to see which parts needed to be delivered. \u201cWhen I asked my boss if we were still going to be paid, he didn\u2019t answer the question,\u201d Phillips told CNN on Thursday. \u201cI\u2019ve been home for a week looking for another job.\u201d Even if CDK resolves the issue, Phillips said he feared the possibility of another cyberattack. \u201cI feel like the writing is on the wall. If hackers can get into a system and take my job away, I feel like it\u2019s probably not the right job to do right now,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no security.\u201d Phillips wasn\u2019t alone in expressing his frustration. \u201c15,000 dealerships is an awful lot to have control over when you do the math,\u201d Irvin said of CDK. \u201cIt is ridiculous.\u201d Irvin said he realized something was amiss with the CDK software he relied on to help prospective clients when a couple interested in purchasing a new Ford Bronco Sport came in to his dealership early last week. \u201cI couldn\u2019t do anything I normally can do,\u201d Irvin said. \u201cI was at a complete standstill and was only able to do really basic things.\u201d Without CDK\u2019s recordkeeping system, Irvin also said he believed his dealership cannot keep track of accurate commission payments. \u201cYou have to make sales,\u201d said Irvin. \u201cOtherwise, you go home and you don\u2019t eat.\u201d Even without access to the software, business has carried on, albeit slowly. In the end, Irvin said it took a week to get the couple who bought their Ford Bronco Sport the bill of sale, which proves ownership of their new car. All of the documents had to be written out by hand. And after more than a week at home, Phillips\u2019 boss texted him to return to work on Friday. They planned to track some parts deliveries and check collections manually. \u201cI\u2019m surprised they didn\u2019t come up with the method sooner!\u201d Phillips wrote in an email. \u201cIt will be a new adventure.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/30/cars/cdk-outage-car-dealers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/01/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_29_business_tractor-supply-dei-roles-goals", "text": "Tractor Supply Company has eliminated its diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives as part of what the retail chain says is a push to distance itself from \u201cnonbusiness activities\u201d after conservative backlash from some of its customer base. In a news release Thursday, Tractor Supply, which advertises itself as the country\u2019s \u201clargest rural lifestyle retailer,\u201d said it will stop sponsoring activities like \u201cpride festivals and voting campaigns\u201d and would be cutting DEI roles and \u201cretire (its) current DEI goals while still ensuring a respectful environment.\u201d \u201cWe have heard from customers that we have disappointed them,\u201d the company said. \u201cWe have taken this feedback to heart.\u201d The about-face comes less than a month after right-wing commentator Robby Starbuck attacked the company\u2019s LGBTQ-inclusive stance and DEI hiring initiatives in a series of posts on X. Starbuck, who in 2022 launched a failed bid for Tennessee\u2019s 5th Congressional District, called on customers to boycott Tractor Supply and contact its corporate leadership. After the policy pivot was announced, Starbuck took to X again, calling the move a \u201cmassive victory\u201d and \u201cthe single biggest boycott win of our lifetime.\u201d Shaun Harper, a professor of business, public policy and education at the University of Southern California, told CNN one reason for the conservative backlash was the fact Tractor Supply failed to tailor its DEI policy to the culture in which it operates. The Brentwood, Tennessee-based company, which bills itself as the largest supporter of the National FFA Organization, a non-profit supporting agricultural education, has deep ties to rural communities across 49 states. Harper says Tractor Supply\u2019s inclusion policies should have been attuned to that specific cultural context. \u201cYou can\u2019t say you\u2019re going to try to do at Tractor Supply what they do at the Apple headquarters in Cupertino, California \u2014 that\u2019s definitely not going to work,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s what I call \u2018situated DEI.\u2019 I would say start with an emphasis on expanding opportunities for low income people, expanding access to farming for women in rural contexts, and helping people understand how more women and more people of color in the farming industry benefits everyone. And helping them understand that the diversification of the farming industry, with women and people of color doesn\u2019t necessarily have to entail a reduction and opportunities for White male farmers.\u201d Still, activists and experts say Tractor Supply\u2019s backtrack is a blow against civil rights and LGBTQ+ protections for employees and customers. \u201cHomophobia, transphobia, sexism, gender discrimination, workplace sexual harassment, ableism, size-ism and racism are not going to eliminate themselves,\u201d said Harper. \u201cIn the absence of good policy and programs within companies, the danger is that those long-standing problems are going to become exacerbated. There\u2019s going to be more conflict between and among employees, and customers who represent various diverse groups.\u201d Tractor Supply also said it would \u201cno longer submit data to the Human Rights Campaign,\u201d one of the biggest LGBTQ+ non-profit advocacy groups in the United States. It was one of more than 1,300 businesses to participate in the HRC\u2019s Corporate Equality Index, a benchmarking survey and report measuring policies and practices relating to LGBTQ+ workplace equality. In 2023, the company earned a near-perfect score of 95/100 for instating workplace protections and benefits taking LGBTQ+ employees into account, providing inclusivity training to workers, and performing outreach to the LGBTQ+ community. \u201cTractor Supply Co is turning its back on their own neighbors with this shortsighted decision,\u201d Eric Bloem, vice president of Programs and Corporate Advocacy at the Human Rights Campaign, told CNN in a statement Saturday. \u201cLGBTQ+ people live in every zip code in this country, including rural communities. We are shoppers, farmers, veterans and agriculture students. Companies from every industry work closely with us to be sure their employees and customers are respected, valued and can get the job done for their workforce and shareholders. This is why the Tractor Supply \u2014 and most of the country\u2019s biggest employers \u2014 have worked with us for years to create inclusive policies and practices. Caving to far right extremists is only going to hurt the same folks that these businesses rely on.\u201d A trend of bowing to anti-LGBTQ+ voices The policy reversal is part of a wider trend of corporate vacillation over LGBTQ+ inclusion. In the face of anti-LGBTQ backlash threatening companies\u2019 bottom line, several household brands have backed down in their support of inclusivity. Last year, Bud Light\u2019s partnership with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney sparked an anti-trans backlash and a monthslong boycott of the beer brand, throughout which the company failed to take a firm stance in support of Mulvaney and the transgender community. The boycott and the subsequent tepid response lost parent company Anheuser-Busch InBev as much as $1.4 billion in sales, as well as its credibility with a major LGBTQ+ non-profit. Last month, retailer Target said it will limit how many stores would carry its Pride-themed collection for adults after a boycott from right-wing activists last summer led to a sharp dip in sales. While bowing to consumer backlash might seem like the safest strategy to claw back revenue lost in a boycott, it can also be shortsighted. Harper argues few companies consider the potential cost of litigation from customers and employees. \u201cSo much money gets wasted on settlements or damages for discrimination and harassment,\u201d he said. \u201cI want companies to not just think about sales, but also about the cost of litigation, as well as the reputational costs. Those are the parts that business leaders aren\u2019t thinking about as they are folding on DEI.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/29/business/tractor-supply-dei-roles-goals/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/01/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_29_business_lego-most-stolen-items", "text": "Lego\u2019s fanbase, which famously cuts across kids, teenagers and grownup collectors, is seeing some unsavory characters break into the mix, and for all the wrong reasons. Lego products, especially the pricier sets that range from over $100 to $1,000 or more, are being targeted for theft both by individual shoplifters and larger organized retail crime rings who make a beeline for sets sitting on store shelves because they can fetch a good profit at resale both in legal and illegal channels. Miguel Zuniga, who operates a Bricks & Minifigs Lego resale franchise store in Lumita, Los Angeles County, is still dealing with a break-in on June 18. The Lego heist happened around 5 am that Tuesday morning. \u201cI was asleep, and the ADT security system gave me a call. Then my wife got a call. I went straight to the cameras and saw we were being robbed,\u201d Zuniga told CNN. He got to his store within 10 minutes, but the burglars were gone \u2013 with about $5,000 to $7,000 of Legos, he estimates. Retail crime experts told CNN that stolen Lego sets are easy to resell, they\u2019re typically hard to trace and they can fetch close to the original retail price if in mint condition and unused. Even used sets in decent shape can go for 50% of the original price. In recent months, robbers have stolen Legos in several states. Earlier this month, police in California arrested two people in connection with a retail theft ring that allegedly stole thousands of Lego toys from several Southern California retailers, according to CNN affiliate KABC. LAPD detectives recovered more than 2,800 boxes of Lego toys with retail value of $20 to over $1,000 per item, the report quoted a police statement as saying. In Philadelphia, police logged a series of Lego set thefts in recent months at retailers such as Barnes & Noble and Target, with stolen sets valued from $250 to up to $1,000 each. Target told CNN it did not have any information to share on Lego thefts at its stores. Barnes & Noble did not immediately respond to a request for comment. And north of the border, in Richmond, British Columbia, police in March seized a haul of more than 1,000 stolen toys. Among the stolen goods were more than $150,000 worth of Lego sets and other plush toys. Among the most stolen products Although hard data is difficult to come by, experts said Lego sets are routinely among the top 10 most stolen retail products, along with branded denim, handbags, designer shoes, Olay skincare and Apple products. \u201cLego is unique. The brand is always refreshing their offerings, always on trend with tie-ins to pop culture and special edition sets,\u201d said Read Hayes, a criminologist at the University of Florida and the director of the Loss Prevention Research Council, whose members include Walmart, Target, Home Depot and Gap. Hayes told CNN his team works with a majority of retailers that carry Lego products as well as Legoland theme parks. \u201cDemand is always there.\u201d As a result, there\u2019s not only a market for stolen Lego products but also a burgeoning counterfeit market, especially online. Casey Slaughter, a captain with the Wichita, Kansas, police department who heads its property crimes bureau, is very familiar with Lego offenses. \u201cWe see Lego toys as one of the more frequently stolen items in our area,\u201d Slaughter told CNN. \u201cAny retailer selling the brand is susceptible to Lego theft, but we also have a couple of Lego-specific secondhand stores that have popped up as resellers. They\u2019re being targeted.\u201d It\u2019s easy money for Lego thieves, he said. \u201cThey\u2019re difficult to track where they were stolen from,\u201d he said. Between January 8, 2024 and May 7, 2024, Wichita Police investigated 19 Lego thefts, according to data the police department provided to CNN. Thefts included sets based on Star Wars, Indiana Jones and Back to the Future films, the data indicated. When reached for comment, Lego directed CNN to online resources on its website to educate consumers how to spot fake online Lego stores and fake Lego products. In California, several Bricks & Minifigs stores have been robbed since April. \u201cThis is probably our fourth or fifth hit that deals mainly with Legos. They happen quickly, 30 seconds to a minute,\u201d Captain Calvin Mah with the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department\u2019s major crimes bureau said in an interview with CNN, referring to the robbery at Zuniga\u2019s store. \u201cIn watching the surveillance video, I could see them targeting specific Lego sets. They knew exactly what they were looking for. They wanted the high-end and high-value sets, the rare or collectible ones,\u201d he said. Zuniga got emotional when speaking about the robbery to CNN. After cleaning his store the day of the burglary, Zuniga went home to shower. \u201cWhen I came back I sent a bat signal to the community to come and support us in our time of need,\u201d he said. Customers came, some even donating their Lego sets. He bought Lego sets that were on sale at the local Target to fill up empty shelves. \u201cAt 9 am, the first customer that came was a 71-year-old who has built some of the most expensive Lego sets,\u201d Zuniga recounted, his own voice cracking as he sobbed. \u201cHe\u2019s our local legend. He showed up in tears.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/29/business/lego-most-stolen-items/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/01/2024", "section": "business"}}

You can sign up\u00a0right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link. Companies have become fonder of part-timers these days. Demand for full-time workers on jobs site Indeed has been flat from January 2022 to May of this year, according to a recent analysis of millions of job postings, but advertisements for part-time gigs were up about 10% over the same period. Postings for those kinds of jobs took off in 2022 and have remained near those elevated levels ever since. (Full-time is still the most common type of work on Indeed by far, according to the report.) Hiring activity has shown a similar trend: The level of part-time employment was\u00a0up 8.9% in May from January 2022, compared to the 1.5% increase of full-time employment during the same period, according to Labor Department data. The could signal a turning point in the labor market, a key aspect of the economy the Federal Reserve is watching as it mulls the timing of the first interest rate cut, after it jacked up borrowing costs to a 23-year high to combat inflation. San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly laid out how the job market has changed recently and what could be ahead at an event hosted by the Commonwealth Club World Affairs of California last week. \u201cSo far, the labor market has adjusted slowly, and the unemployment rate has only edged up. But we are getting nearer to a point where that benign outcome could be less likely,\u201d Daly said. \u201cFuture labor market slowing could translate into higher unemployment, as firms need to adjust not just vacancies but actual jobs.\u201d The US job market overall remains robust, but it has cooled some over the past year. The unemployment rate crept up to 4% in May, after remaining below that exceptionally low threshold for more than two years. The number of new applications for unemployment benefits, a proxy for layoffs, has trended up in recent weeks, with continuing claims last week reaching the highest level since November 2021. There were 8.1 million job openings in April, according to the latest government figures, down substantially from the record high of 12.2 million in March 2022. The Indeed report noted the change could be a sign of employer weakness or employer strength, underscoring the growing uncertainty in the labor market. Are employers losing their appetite for the cost of hiring full-time workers, or are they responding to a workforce eager for the flexibility a part-time schedule could offer? \u201cWhether out of competitive necessity to attract workers in a still-tight market with the promise of additional flexibility, and/or out of economic necessity as the economy cools and fewer worker hours are needed, the upshot for workers is clear: More part-time roles are available for those that desire or require them,\u201d the report said. The industries that were most likely to advertise part-time work as of May were beauty and wellness; personal care and home health; retail; food preparation and service; and sports, Indeed said. In May, the biggest increases in job postings offering part-time work from two years earlier were in beauty and wellness (+26.9%); marketing (+10.2%); hospitality and tourism (+9.9%); media and communications (+8.9%); and arts and entertainment (+7.9%). During the Great Recession from 2007 to 2009, part-time work rose sharply, according to research from the San Francisco Fed. Daniel Culbertson, the economist who authored the Indeed report, said the opposite was true when the economy was in the thick of a stunning recovery after the brief recession in 2020. \u201cThere was this rise in part-time work when the economy and the labor market were doing well coming out of the pandemic,\u201d Culbertson told CNN. US prices didn\u2019t rise last month for the first time since November Prices in the US didn\u2019t rise in May, lending to a welcome reprieve for cost-wary Americans and helping to bring inflation even closer to normal levels, reports my colleague Alicia Wallace. The Personal Consumption Expenditures price index \u2014 a closely watched inflation gauge that the Federal Reserve uses to measure if the economy is approaching the central bank\u2019s 2% target \u2014 was unchanged from April and slowed to 2.6% for the 12 months ended in May from 2.7% the month before, according to Commerce Department data released Friday. Falling gas prices (down 2.1% for the month) and cheaper goods prices (down 0.4%) helped to slow overall inflation, according to the report. Food prices increased a modest 0.1%. Excluding energy and food \u2014 categories that tend to be quite volatile \u2014 the core PCE price index increased by 0.1% for the month, cooling to a fresh three-year low of 2.6% from 2.8% the month before. Friday\u2019s report came in line with expectations. The Commerce Department\u2019s monthly Personal Income and Outlays report also includes critical data on how Americans earn, spend and save. Consumer spending, which is a significant driver of economic activity, increased 0.2% for the month, accelerating from 0.1% the month before. Excluding inflation, real spending grew 0.3%.

{"id": "2024_06_29_business_boeing-criminal-charges-implications", "text": "Criminal charges against a corporation, like the ones the Justice Department is considering bringing against Boeing, would be a serious blow, worsening the company\u2019s already precarious financial situation and further damaging its battered reputation. But it wouldn\u2019t necessarily result in past or current executives facing prison time. While criminal charges against corporations are fairly common, the overwhelming majority are against small, closely-held companies. They aren\u2019t brought nearly as often against publicly-traded companies, let alone those in the Dow Jones Industrial Average\u2019s index of the nation\u2019s 30 most important companies. And despite the fact that almost all illegal actions on behalf of a company are committed by individuals, not the company itself, it\u2019s rare for top executives - especially at larger companies - to face personal punishment. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to convict that person,\u201d said Jennifer Arlen, law professor and director of the program on corporate compliance and enforcement at New York University. \u201cSometimes you don\u2019t need to name them.\u201d At a smaller, closely held company where the owner is the only employee who would face criminal charges, the owner might be more willing to have the company take the hit. That\u2019s even if it means going out of business due to an unaffordable fine, rather than to charges themselves, Arlen said. But at a major public company with thousands of employees, those top executives making decisions might agree to a settlement that leads to criminal charges for lower level individuals. But they\u2019re unlikely to reach a settlement in which they face criminal prosecution themselves. But even without any individuals facing prison time, criminal charges have serious enough implications that no publicly traded company wants to have that on its record, Arlen said. That\u2019s why they typically seek civil, not criminal settlements, as Boeing has done numerous times in just the past few years. Two examples are when it faced charges of violating the Arms Export Control Act, which involved the alleged downloading of sensitive military secrets by unauthorized employees in China, or the False Claims Act, which involved allegations of fraudulent billing on government contracts. Boeing paid tens of millions in fines in recent cases involving those violation, but they were civil settlements, not criminal. The civil settlement can allow the company to say it has never been convicted of or pleaded guilty to a felony, and thus not have to worry about the legal implications that go with that being on a company\u2019s record. \u201cNo major publicly held firm wants to be convicted of a felony,\u201d Arlen said. \u201cThat\u2019s why companies will try to negotiate for something else.\u201d The company can also reach agreements to defer prosecution, which means the company is essentially given a probationary period after which the threat of prosecution goes away. That\u2019s what Boeing did in January 2021 to settle allegations it defrauded the Federal Aviation Administration when it was seeking certification of the 737 Max. Earlier criminal settlement now at risk The potential charges hanging over Boeing currently revolve around that January 2021 deferred prosecution agreement. The government alleged at that time, and Boeing agreed to in its settlement, that it had provided \u201cmisleading statements, half-truths, and omissions\u201d to the FAA about a feature in its 737 Max jets when seeking certification for it to carry passengers. That feature, and the lack of information Boeing provided about potential problems, were found to be the cause of two fatal crashes of the plane in 2018 and 2019 that killed a total of 346 people. \u201cThe tragic crashes\u2026 exposed fraudulent and deceptive conduct by employees of one of the world\u2019s leading commercial airplane manufacturers,\u201d acting Assistant Attorney General David Burns said at the time of the settlement. \u201cBoeing\u2019s employees chose the path of profit over candor by concealing material information from the FAA concerning the operation of its 737 Max airplane and engaging in an effort to cover up their deception.\u201d But family members of the crash victims criticized the deal as letting Boeing off too lightly. They have argued Boeing should face new criminal charges and pay a fine as great as $24.9 billion. Boeing was given a three-year period as part of the settlement to prove to the government that it had changed its behavior, after which it no longer would face the potential of criminal charges over the fraud. But days before that period was due to end, a door plug blew off a Boeing 737 Max jet as the plane, with passengers aboard and flown by Alaska Airlines, approached 16,000 feet. That opened the door to possible prosecution on the earlier charges. In May, the Justice Department said it was looking into bringing criminal charges against Boeing once again due to a potential violation of that January 2021 agreement. Prosecutors in the DOJ are urging that charges be filed against Boeing, a source familiar with the case has told CNN. Boeing has argued in its own court filings that it did not violate the agreement and that it should be spared prosecution. No individual \u2013 neither the lower-level employees alleged to have provided false information to the FAA, or the top executives of Boeing \u2013 were charged with a crime as part of the settlement. One former employee, Mark Forkner, Boeing\u2019s chief technical pilot at the time, allegedly provided some of the false information and was later indicted. His attorneys argued that he was made a scapegoat by Boeing, and he was later found not guilty. Big dollars at stake Oil company BP agreed to pay $4 billion in penalties to settle criminal charges, including felony manslaughter charges, related to the explosion and oil spill at its Deepwater Horizon oil platform in 2010. It paid more than $60 billion in other legal settlements related to the accident. Volkswagen pleaded guilty to three US felony criminal charges and agreed to pay $4.3 billion in criminal and civil penalties in 2017 related to the emissions scandal, in which it cheated emissions tests done on its diesel cars by the US Environmental Protection Agency. By contrast, Boeing agreed to pay $2.5 billion as part of the January 2021 settlement, but $1.8 billion of that was money it had already agreed to pay to its airline customers as compensation for the 20-month grounding of the planes. The criminal fine paid to the government came to only $244 million, with an additional $500 million set aside to compensate family members of victims. So there would be serious implications for Boeing with new criminal charges, even if it were to reach a new settlement that defers prosecution once again. It could face significantly larger fines than the ones it already agreed to pay, fines that could easily stretch into the billions \u2013 if not tens of billions \u2013 if crash victim families get their way. That could force Boeing\u2019s debt rating into junk bond status for the first time in its history, significantly raising its borrowing costs and worsening its already precarious financial situation. At the end of the first quarter it had just less than $7 billion in cash on hand, and nearly $47 billion in long-term debt. A possible corporate death sentence There\u2019s a good chance, according to Arlen and other experts, that Boeing ends up having a federal monitor oversee how it conducts business. \u201cFirms don\u2019t like a monitor,\u201d Arlen said. \u201cBut Boeing has some pretty significant quality control problems.\u201d Pleading guilty to criminal charges rather than again deferring prosecution could result in restrictions on doing business in some countries that have prohibitions on companies found guilty of a felony, Arlen said. In the most extreme scenario it could be blocked from conducting business with the federal government, a highly unlikely or impossible scenario. Such a prohibition, while theoretically possible, would be a death sentence for a company that gets 37% of its revenue from US government contracts. Besides the disruption to the American economy that Boeing\u2019s disappearance would cause, it would also deprive the federal government of many of the defense aircraft, rockets and satellites that it gets from Boeing, as well as crippling plans for most of the nation\u2019s airlines to get the planes and parts they need. Arlen said it is common for smaller companies to be forced out of business by criminal charges and the penalties that follow. It\u2019s less common for larger businesses. But it can happen in the health care sector, where a criminal charge can lead to a company not being able to do business with Medicare or Medicaid. Perhaps the most famous company forced out of business by criminal charges was accounting firm Arthur Andersen, once one of the nation\u2019s \u201cBig Five\u201d accounting firms that audited the books of major publicly-traded companies. which was found guilty by a jury in 2002 of obstruction of justice for destroying records of its client Enron, after it had been notified of a federal investigation. The Supreme Court later unanimously overturned that conviction, ruling that \u201cjury instructions at issue simply failed to convey the requisite consciousness of wrongdoing.\u201d But by the time of that victory in 2005, the conviction had essentially forced the firm out of business.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/29/business/boeing-criminal-charges-implications/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/01/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_28_business_nyc-libraries-funding-restored", "text": "New York City officials have agreed to restore more than $111 million in funding to libraries and cultural institutions, the City Council announced Thursday. The agreement is a victory for residents and organizations who had been pushing back for months against budget cuts in the nation\u2019s largest city and one of the world\u2019s foremost cultural capitals. In November, the city announced it would cut the budget of the New York Public libraries by $58.3 million in fiscal year 2025, and slash the budget for other cultural institutions, including the Bronx Zoo and Carnegie Hall, by $53 million. The new deal reverses those cuts, and is set to be finalized in a City Council vote Sunday. \u201cWe are proud to announce a full restoration of funds to both our libraries and cultural institutions in the upcoming budget,\u201d said New York City Mayor Eric Adams in a statement Thursday. \u201cThese institutions are a critical part of New York City\u2019s social fabric, which New Yorkers depend on for their children\u2019s growth and the vibrancy of our city.\u201d Adams\u2019 office unveiled additional cultural sector cuts of $7.6 million in January, before reversing those cuts in May. \u201cOur arts and cultural institutions and libraries are foundational pillars of our city, and New Yorkers depend on their services every day,\u201d said New York City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, thanking the mayor\u2019s administration for reaching the deal. \u201cThe Council has consistently championed funding restorations for these institutions as a top priority, and we\u2019re proud to reach an agreement with Mayor Adams and the administration to successfully secure these critical investments for them in the city budget.\u201d The news was received with collective approval from New York institutions that had been forced to cut hours and public access due to lack of funding. \u201cThe Museum of the City of New York is delighted to learn of the restoration of cuts to the cultural sector,\u201d the museum\u2019s president Stephanie Hill Wilchfort told CNN in a statement. \u201cThis support makes it possible for MCNY to be open seven days a week, starting on July 1,\u201d said Wilchfort, who serves as Executive Vice Chair of the Cultural Institutions Group, a coalition of 34 non-profit organizations such as the city\u2019s museums, gardens, and arts centers. \u201cAs such, the Museum\u2019s exhibitions exploring history, popular culture, and art will be open to the public on Tuesdays and Wednesdays for the first time since the pandemic. City support also allows the Museum to operate as a cooling center, open at no charge to anyone who seeks relief from warm weather.\u201d The city\u2019s three public library systems \u2014 New York, Queens, and Brooklyn \u2014 issued a joint statement thanking the administration, the city council and New York residents, who overwhelmingly supported the campaign to restore library budgets. More than 174,000 people sent letters to City Hall in support of the \u201cNo Cuts to Libraries!\u201d campaign since the cuts were announced in November. \u201cThis funding will allow us to resume seven-day service, a priority for many New Yorkers,\u201d the libraries said in a statement shared with CNN. \u201cWe expect that service to begin in the coming weeks, bringing our branches back to the same hours of operation prior to the November 2023 cuts. The funding also allows us to continue universal six-day service, which New Yorkers have enjoyed for nearly a decade.\u201d Not all library locations are open seven days a week, but those who did offer the service were forced to close on Sundays following the budget cuts. A flat budget amid rising costs But the budget restoration may not be enough for the libraries, which operate as publicly owned community spaces and provide residents with social services like English classes, career hubs, tax preparation centers and after school programs. While the proposed 2025 budget doesn\u2019t catastrophically gut the city\u2019s libraries, they are still facing a nominally flat budget that does not account for inflation or rising costs. Last month, the presidents of the three library systems testified before the City Council on increasing costs, including maintaining library infrastructure, providing staff with equitable wages and ensuring that there are enough physical, audio and downloadable books for the city\u2019s roughly 9 million residents. \u201cWe are running a library system today on a pre-pandemic funding level that has not kept pace with inflation,\u201d Linda Johnson, president and CEO of Brooklyn Public Library said at the time. \u201cRestoration alone will not solve our operating budget needs.\u201d Tony Marx, president of the New York Public Library reiterated those sentiments, stating that library operation costs are increasing across the board for wages, health insurance, library materials, maintaining collections and technology. \u201cWe estimate that unreimbursed cost growth next year may be more than $9 million,\u201d he added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/28/business/nyc-libraries-funding-restored/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/01/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_21_opinions_sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic", "text": "The biggest tech news this week is the\u00a0ouster\u00a0of Sam Altman from his role as CEO of OpenAI, a move that has shaken the company and the industry. Hundreds of OpenAI employees have threatened to\u00a0resign. Altman has already\u00a0moved on\u00a0to a role at Microsoft. And OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is on its\u00a0third CEO\u00a0in as many days. It\u2019s all very juicy. But this drama should also be raising larger questions, far beyond one company\u2019s internal hirings and firings, including: Who are the people making the decisions\u00a0that will determine so much of our technological future? What guiding principles are they using to make those decisions? And how should other institutions \u2013 governments, non-tech industries, global alliances, regulatory bodies \u2013 reign in the worst excesses of potentially dangerous AI innovators? OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, with an explicit mission to harness what may soon be superhuman intelligence \u201cto benefit humanity as a whole.\u201d But that sensibility hasn\u2019t lasted. The company now has a multi-billion-dollar for-profit arm. They have been developing new technologies at lightning speed, and sometimes sending them out to the public\u00a0before some employees believed they were ready. The company has already reportedly invented an AI technology so dangerous they will never release it \u2013 but they also\u00a0won\u2019t tell\u00a0reporters or the public exactly what it is. This dynamic \u2013 a potentially dangerous technology developed at extreme speed, largely behind closed doors \u2013 is partly to blame for Altman\u2019s firing. The OpenAI board, according to\u00a0CNN\u2019s David Goldman, worried that \u201cthe company was making the technological equivalent of a nuclear bomb, and its caretaker, Sam Altman, was moving so fast that he risked a global catastrophe.\u201d At particular issue seemed to be Altman\u2019s efforts to make the tools behind ChatGPT available to anyone who wanted to make their own version of the chatbot. This could be widely disastrous, some board members worried. But then they fired him without warning, and apparently without involving Microsoft, the company\u2019s largest shareholder. Now, Altman is at the new AI group at Microsoft, and one has to wonder if the oversight and caution there will be on par with that at OpenAI, or if he\u2019ll be handed carte blanche to push as fast and hard as he wants. And for all the justified reticence of the OpenAI board, the company has carried out much of its work in secrecy \u2013 without the public really understanding what a handful of unaccountable technologists are building, and how it is nearly guaranteed to indelibly change their lives. AI is broadly understood to have the potential to reshape vast swaths of human existence. At the very least, it seems nearly guaranteed to change how we process information, how we communicate, how we learn and how we work (and if we work). And the ramifications could be much more extreme. AI technologies have already demonstrated the ability\u00a0to lie and to cover their tracks. They have already been able to\u00a0suggest the design\u00a0to make a virus spread more quickly. Many researchers\u00a0acutely understand\u00a0just how quickly these machines could develop the capacity to annihilate us, including Altman: He has a prepper\u2019s paradise prepared in Big Sur, complete with guns and \u201cgas masks from the Israeli Defense Force\u201d in case AI goes off the rails and the robots go to war against humans,\u00a0according to reporting in the New Yorker. But don\u2019t worry, he told an Atlantic reporter: If AI is determined to wipe us out, \u201cno gas mask is helping anyone.\u201d (If you want an excellent and terrifying rundown of AI\u2019s risks \u2013 at least those we understand right now, which are almost certainly a mere sliver of the looming perils \u2013\u00a0the Atlantic profile of Altman and his technology\u00a0is worth a read). AI is very exciting technology. But it is also a potentially very dangerous one, and not in the social media sense of \u201cit may give us bad self-esteem and make us lonelier\u201d but in the sense of \u201cit could break down human societies and kill us all.\u201d Given the life-altering potential of AI \u2013 that even if it doesn\u2019t kill us all, it will almost certainly change human existence in unprecedented ways at unprecedented speed \u2013 we all have a stake in how it\u2019s being developed. And yet the development is being left to a handful of people (who seem to be\u00a0largely\u00a0men) in Silicon Valley, and other tech pockets around the globe. And we all have a stake in whose interests AI will serve \u2013 and right now, its development is being funded with billions of dollars by people expecting to make a huge profit. Do the interests of the public align with the interests of the shareholders to whom profit-driven, potentially tremendously lucrative-for-a-few companies are beholden? Or with the interests of tech entrepreneurs who are primarily excited about being at the forefront of the AI revolution, regardless of the potential human costs? One thing is clear: AI is coming. And how it is built and unleashed on the public matters more than perhaps any technology of the past century. It is, indeed, up there with the atom bomb in its destructive potential \u2013 except likely more difficult to regulate and control. \u201cRegulation\u201d does not begin to scratch the surface of what\u2019s needed to make sure that the AI future is not a catastrophic one, especially since the development of AI is now a massive international arms race, with particularly horrific implications if bad actors develop this technology first. But regulation is, at minimum, a necessary step. So is transparency: In the US, companies have wide leverage to work behind a veil of secrecy, and much of what AI companies do is kept secret to stymy competition. But the public certainly has a right to understand what life-altering technologies are set to be inflicted upon us, and what the creators are doing to protect humanity \u2013 our jobs, our communities, our families, our connections, our educations and our abilities to build a life of purpose, but also our lives and our safety. The Altman story is fascinating because Altman is the most powerful figure in AI technology, which in effect makes him one of the most powerful men in the world. But that should give us pause: Who is he, what power does he hold, what is he doing with it, who does he answer to, and are we comfortable with this much life-altering potential being held by a few unaccountable people?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/21/opinions/sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/01/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2022_04_25_business_electric-hybrid-corvette", "text": "General Motors will produce a fully electric Chevrolet Corvette, GM President Mark Reuss announced in a LinkedIn post Monday morning.  Reuss didn\u2019t say when the electric Corvette would come, but he hinted that a hybrid model could come relatively soon. \u201cWe will offer an electrified Corvette as early as next year,\u201d he wrote. An accompanying video the company posted to Twitter showed what appeared to be a hybrid Corvette, and in another first, showed the front wheels spinning and throwing snow as if being powered. All Corvettes produced by the company previously have been rear-wheel-drive only. While Reuss\u2019s post implies a hybrid Corvette will be based on the current generation of the car, it\u2019s not clear if the all-electric version will be a variation of this car or a completely different future model. \u201cElectrified\u201d is an auto industry term encompassing everything from hybrid to fully electric vehicles, and anything with an electric motor can count as \u201celectrified.\u201d It has long been rumored that the current generation of the Corvette, the first with its gasoline engine mounted behind the seats instead of in the front, could be built with a hybrid system. Reuss has also previously hinted there would be electrified variants of the car. Various companies are working on electric sports cars. Most all-electric vehicles in production so far have been four-door sedans and SUVs, as the need for batteries lends itself to larger and heavier vehicles. Tesla\u2019s first car, the Lotus Elise-based Tesla Roadster, was an electric sports car, but the second-generation of Tesla Roadster, originally unveiled as a prototype in 2017, has yet to go into production. Some manufacturers, such as Lamborghini, have said that current battery technology doesn\u2019t allow for a optimum sports car performance from a purely electric vehicle. Lamborghini has been working on plug-in hybrid sports cars, though. To date, the Corvette is only available in the base Stingray version with 6.2-liter V8 engine producing up to 495 horsepower. A 670 horsepower Corvette Z06 with a 5.5-liter V8 was unveiled last fall. The previous generation of the Corvette included included a 755-horsepower ZR1 version. Nothing like that has yet been announced for the current model but GM engineers have said a major reason for putting the engine in the back was to allow for better performance at extremely high horsepower levels. Besides saving gas, hybrid systems can also be used in high-performance cars to add additional power and to provide for quicker acceleration since electric motors can provide power to the wheels more quickly than gas engines. Ferrari\u2019s most powerful sports cars are hybrids, for instance.   GM has said it plans to produce only zero-emission vehicles, meaning fully electric or powered by hydrogen fuel cells, by 2035.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/25/business/electric-hybrid-corvette/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/01/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_30_business_westjet-strike-flight-cancellations-update", "text": "Labor negotiations between WestJet, Canada\u2019s second-largest airline, and the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association remain at a standstill after the union called a surprise strike last week, forcing more than 400 flight cancellations and delays over the weekend. The union, which represents nearly 700 aircraft engineers and technicians, went on strike Friday after negotiations over the group\u2019s first collective bargaining agreement with the airline broke down over what it said was WestJet\u2019s \u201crefusal to negotiate.\u201d The strike follows back-and-forth talks between the union and the airline stretching back to September 2023, when representatives met for an initial bargaining session. At the meeting, according to a memo from the association, union representatives raised concerns including \u201cfurloughs out of seniority order, irregularities in pay scale, and work privileges that have been eliminated without notice or rationale.\u201d In addition to wage increases, the union is seeking protections for certain positions and improved benefits such as health care. On Sunday, the union told CNN \u201cthe parties are separated by a first-year economic difference of approximately 7%, less than $8 million.\u201d WestJet has repeatedly condemned the strike, which comes during a long holiday weekend in Canada. The company says the strike will affect about 250,000 travelers\u2019 plans. WestJet said in a statement Friday it has sought \u201cimmediate intervention by the Minister of Labour and the Canada Industrial Relations Board.\u201d The airline says it has had to cancel more than 410 flights between Thursday and Saturday. Data from flight tracker FlightAware shows WestJet on Sunday had canceled at least 343 flights, constituting 77% of its fleet. The airline\u2019s regional subsidiary, WestJet Encore, has canceled at least 80 flights. Airports across Canada are also facing major service suspensions. At Calgary International Airport, 42% of outbound flights and 40% of inbound flights have been canceled. Toronto Pearson, Vancouver and Edmonton international airports are also affected. But in an update to members on Sunday shared with CNN, the union announced the industrial relations board ruled the strike was lawful, as the board continues to mediate negotiations. \u201cAlthough the compulsory arbitration imposed by the Minister of Labour is scheduled to move forward on an expedited basis, the CIRB has held that, until that process is completed, we are entitled to continue our legal strike,\u201d the union said. The industrial relations board has not responded to CNN\u2019s request for comment. The union told CNN it had made its last offer to the airline on Thursday, and since then WestJet has not responded or given any indication of future bargaining dates. The union also detailed a drawn out and unproductive mediation process over the weekend. \u201cAt 1:00 a.m. Eastern on Saturday, June 29, after waiting hours in a virtual breakout room, the mediators returned to inform us that WestJet executives had decided to \u2018call it a night,\u2019\u201d the union said in its update.

{"id": "2024_03_26_media_nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash", "text": "Cesar Conde has a decision to make \u2014 and it\u2019s not an especially difficult one. The NBCUniversal News Group chair is facing a torrent of backlash from his own staff after greenlighting the hire of former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel as a paid network contributor. Over the last 24 hours, the most prominent and recognizable NBC News and MSNBC personalities have voiced strong displeasure with the company\u2019s decision to welcome McDaniel to \u201cthe team.\u201d And they\u2019re not doing it via anonymous comments to the press. They\u2019re doing it on the record on NBCU\u2019s own air. Chuck Todd broke the dam on Sunday\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with a set of candid comments about the hiring, and Rachel Maddow capped the flood of backlash Monday night with a blistering 30-minute monologue eviscerating the network\u2019s leadership for the \u201cinexplicable\u201d move. Suffice to say, NBCU News Group is in unprecedented territory. Never has a network\u2019s C-suite ever been so thoroughly flogged by its most high-profile stars in such no holds barred fashion. Saying that Conde simply has a crisis on his hands would be a contender for understatement of the year. It\u2019s a five-alarm fire at NBCU News Group, and one of Conde\u2019s own making. While NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown were most directly responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring, a decision that MSNBC boss Rashida Jones did not object to it at the time, the buck ultimately stops with Conde, who hold the real power at the Peacock Network. McDaniel\u2019s hiring could not have happened without Conde\u2019s blessing. It does not take a brilliant political mind with prescient foresight to understand that hiring McDaniel would ignite a firestorm of outrage \u2014 from both within 30 Rock and outside it. Conde, someone who ostensibly supports American democracy, should have rejected McDaniel\u2019s hiring on the grounds that NBCU News Group could not put someone on its payroll who tried to subvert the 2020 vote. As so many of NBCU\u2019s staffers have underscored, the objection to McDaniel is not that she is a Republican. It\u2019s not even that she is a Donald Trump-supporting Republican. It\u2019s that she was an active participant in the plot to overthrow the last presidential election. That is not to even mention McDaniel\u2019s years of demonizing the press, smearing the journalists who work at NBC News and MSNBC as she sought to destroy the credibility of the organization that she ran to after being chased out of the RNC. The notion put forward by NBC that it needed to hire McDaniel to bring its viewers \u201can insider\u2019s perspective on national politics and the future of the Republican Party\u201d is absurd. If that\u2019s the case, the network should move to hire free agents like Tucker Carlson or Candace Owens. They too have their hands on the pulse of the Republican Party. In fact, they represent much more of where the GOP stands today than McDaniel. So, using NBC\u2019s logic, why not hire them? (Spoiler: News organizations rightfully have established basic standards for paid contributors. Asking that your employees have a commitment to democracy, to the truth, and to basic decency is not a big ask.) But even if Conde has no allegiance to basic democratic principles, which this hire calls into question, given that he is known to be a political player who cares deeply about his own image in the press, he should have been wise enough to foresee that hiring McDaniel would be an ill-conceived move. How this did not occur to Conde is unfathomable and shows a tremendous lack of judgment. Even more bizarre is Conde\u2019s management, or lack thereof, since the controversy erupted. It was clear early on that his employees at NBC News and MSNBC did not support McDaniel\u2019s hiring. If that was not evident on Friday, it was clear as day on Sunday after \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d The network\u2019s employees were not only flabbergasted and demoralized by the move, but absolutely enraged by it. At that point, the writing should have been on the wall for Conde \u2014 as it was for every other media executive that I have spoken with over the last 24 hours. It is evident that McDaniel has no real future as an NBC analyst and the decision to bring her on as a contributor will have to be reversed. After all, which NBC or MSNBC program is going to invite her on after all of this? The only real question for Conde after the Sunday morning scolding should have been how he chose to back out of the deal in the least painful way possible. To be fully honest, I very much expected a Sunday evening announcement from NBC, one that would have earned praise from the company\u2019s staff and quickly been swept away by the rush of Trump news Monday morning. But no such announcement came. Instead, Conde has allowed the mess to spiral absolutely out of control. MSNBC\u2019s top stars hammered the network\u2019s leadership throughout the day Monday over the hire. NBC News\u2019 Guild blasted Conde, saying in a statement that under him the company had quietly laid off employees over the last month and instead chosen to \u201cprioritize an election denier over its reporters.\u201d The already severe crisis was allowed to blossom into one of the worst corporate public relations catastrophes in recent memory. All the while, Conde has remained silent. I asked his spokesperson, Stephen Labaton, on Monday whether the NBCU News Group boss had any comment on the situation. Does he have any regret? I didn\u2019t get an on-the-record response. Suffice to say, however, that what Conde does moving forward will say a lot about his character and commitment to democratic values. It will also say a lot about the NBCU News Group and what type of organization it is. In her biting monologue on Monday night, however, Maddow did offer Conde a way out of this mess. \u201cMistakes will be made,\u201d Maddow said.\u201dBut our resilience as a democracy is going to be recognizing when decisions are bad ones and reversing those bad decisions. Hearing legitimate criticism, responding to it, and correcting course. Not digging in. Not blaming others. Take a minute.

VW will invest a total of $5 billion into struggling electric vehicle maker Rivian as part of the arrangement, including a $1 billion immediate investment. The two automakers did not provide a name for the new joint venture company or name its leadership team. Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe said during a conference call that it would have two co-leaders, each reporting to one of the automakers. \u201cThe way the joint venture has been configured as it\u2019s a 50/50 joint venture that\u2019s designed with two co-CEOs that report effectively in to both businesses,\u201d said Scaringe. VW\u2019s investments will provide capital to help Rivian scale up its manufacturing as it looks toward building a new factory in the state of Georgia, Scaringe said. \u201cThis is important for us financially,\u201d he said, \u201cand one of the elements here is that it\u2019s also implicit Rivian\u2019s successes is important for Volkswagen Group\u2019s success.\u201d Both companies said they plan to launch new vehicles utilizing the joint venture\u2019s technologies before 2030. Rivian\u2019s fundamental vehicle software design is expected to provide the basis for the new company\u2019s software. The technologies designed by the company will include both the user-interface software that runs things like the entertainment system and gauges and deeper vehicle software that interacts with things like the vehicle\u2019s motors. Rivian will also contribute the electric hardware designs on which these systems will run, according to a joint announcement. VW already has its own vehicle software subsidiary, Cariad, and that company will continue with its work, VW chief executive Oliver Blume said on a conference call. The new joint venture\u2019s work will be in addition to Cariad\u2019s and not in place of it, he said The companies could also cooperate on vehicles, themselves one day, Scaringe said during the call, but that\u2019s not part of what\u2019s envisioned currently. For now, the companies will just work together on vehicle software and computer systems. The idea for the joint venture first arose when Scaringe and Blume were talking at Porsche\u2019s Experience Center in Atlanta where Porsche owners and enthusiasts can drive Porsche cars and SUVs on a test track. \u201cSo, we had a lot of fun just talking about how aligned we both saw (cars),\u201d Scaringe said. \u201cBut, quickly, that led to a serious conversation as to how can we look at working together.\u201d In addition to being CEO of Volkswagen Group as a whole, Blume is also CEO of Porsche. Scaringe said he, himself, is a longtime Porsche enthusiast and, when he was S to restore classic Porsche sports cars.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/business/rivian-vw-vehicle-software/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/01/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_28_media_ratings-debate-trump-biden-cnn", "text": "CNN\u2019s\u00a0Thursday night\u00a0debate between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump was watched by 51.27 million viewers on television, according to Nielsen data. The 90-minute debate, which\u00a0sent shockwaves\u00a0through the political world, was simulcast across 22 networks. CNN, which hosted the debate from its Atlanta studios, offered a live feed of the telecast to any network free of charge but with strict conditions over its presentation and branding. On television, CNN drew the highest single audience with 9.53 million viewers on its flagship channel, including\u00a03.379 million in the advertiser coveted 25-54 demographic,\u00a0the network said\u00a0Friday. The right-wing talk channel Fox News drew 9.276 million\u00a0viewers, ABC News saw 9.21 million viewers and MSNBC drew 4.122 million viewers. \u201cMore people watched the CNN Presidential Debate than any other CNN program in history,\u201d the network said. The debate was also the most watched non-sports program of the year so far on television. The telecast also drew the largest audience on record for CNN on the\u00a0Max\u00a0streaming service,\u00a0though the network did not disclose audience figures. While the debate drew the largest television audience of the year,\u00a0it represents over a 30% drop in\u00a0audience from 2020,\u00a0when more than 73 million people\u00a0watched the\u00a0first debate\u00a0between Trump and Biden across all television networks. In 2016,\u00a0a record 84 million\u00a0tuned in\u00a0to the first debate matchup between Hillary Clinton and Trump. While fewer Americans watched the debate on television than in previous election years, millions more watched on digital platforms. CNN said the event generated more than 30 million views on its digital properties and on YouTube. The debate was CNN\u2019s biggest event ever on its digital platforms, the network said, and was its most live-streamed event with 2.5 million streams. For CNN,\u00a0Thursday night\u2019s debate was a marketing coup, coming at a pivotal moment for the network as it works to reverse declining ratings and embarks on a strategy to revolutionize the four-decade-old network in the digital era. The previous most-watched program in CNN\u2019s history occurred in 2015, when a GOP debate featuring Trump and a slew of Republican rivals\u00a0averaged 23.1 million viewers. Thursday\u2019s\u00a0primetime matchup\u00a0was a break from\u00a0general election\u00a0debate tradition, which has long been hosted by the\u00a0nonpartisan\u00a0Commission on Presidential Debates and shared with\u00a0television\u00a0networks. While primary debates have traditionally been hosted by\u00a0individual\u00a0networks, the candidates and CNN bucked tradition by completely removing the commission from the equation, holding the debate before the candidates were even officially their party\u2019s nominees. The debate represents a much-needed shot in the arm for CNN, which has seen its ratings fall after changes to its on-air lineup and as traditional television viewers increasingly cut the cord in favor of streaming services. Presidential\u00a0election cycles typically result in a ratings bonanza for news networks as audiences tune in to watch the unfolding\u00a0race \u2014 but\u00a02024 has thus far proven to be the exception, with virtually all news outlets seeing a decline in audience since 2020. While much of the attention in the aftermath of the debate was on Biden\u2019s performance, CNN\u2019s hands-off approach to fact checking during the debate\u00a0elicited some criticism. \u201cI wish the CNN moderators did more fact-checking, letting the audience know when things are said that are flatly false,\u201d wrote New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof. \u201cNot sure how it helps for a platform to transmit falsehoods disguised as facts.\u201d Ahead of the event, CNN political director David Chalian said the network would limit fact checking from the stage, aiming to let the candidates grapple with the issues and \u201cnot become participants in that debate.\u201d Moderators Jake Tapper and Dana Bash took a deliberate approach to questioning, repeatedly following up when the candidates failed to answer questions and policing their allotted speaking time. At one point, Bash pressed Trump three times on whether he\u2019d accept the outcome of the 2024 election. \u201cWe are very proud of Jake and Dana,\u201d a CNN spokesperson said.\u00a0\u201cOur job was to make sure candidates were heard so voters can make informed decisions and we are pleased we were able to do that.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments and context.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/28/media/ratings-debate-trump-biden-cnn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/01/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_22_media_ronna-mcdaniel-nbc", "text": "NBC News on Friday announced that it had hired Ronna McDaniel, the former Republican National Committee chair who has repeatedly\u00a0attacked the network and its journalists,\u00a0assailed the\u00a0news\u00a0media as \u201cfake news\u201d and promoted false claims around the 2020\u00a0vote,\u00a0as an on-air commentator\u00a0ahead of the 2024 presidential election. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be a more important moment to have a voice like Ronna\u2019s on the team,\u201d Carrie Budoff Brown, senior vice president of politics at NBC News, said in a memo\u00a0to staff. McDaniel exited the RNC earlier this month after leading the organization since 2016. During her time as chair, McDaniel repeatedly attacked the press, which has become increasingly popular in Republican circles over the last several years as Donald Trump demonizes journalists and news institutions. McDaniel echoed many such attacks, labeling the press as \u201cfake news\u201d and calling the media \u201ccorrupt.\u201d At times, she even targeted NBC News\u00a0and MSNBC\u00a0with dishonest attacks. In 2019, for instance, McDaniel accused Richard Engel, NBC News\u2019 chief foreign correspondent, of \u201cactively cheering for an economic downturn.\u201d \u201cHow can NBC let him keep his job when he\u2019s made his bias so clear?\u201d McDaniel asked. McDaniel has a lengthier history attacking the progressive cable news channel MSNBC, which she will appear on in her new role. In recent years, she has repeatedly attacked the channel for \u201cspreading lies\u201d and blasted those she described as the network\u2019s \u201cprimetime propagandists.\u201d An NBC spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment about her attacks on the news media and NBC. In her role as RNC chief, McDaniel also fanned the flames of election denialism after the 2020 presidential contest. McDaniel was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d The Michigan Department of State\u2019s office condemned her claims of supposed voter fraud in the wake of the election, stating they had \u201cno merit.\u201d\u00a0The state\u2019s \u201celections were conducted fairly, effectively and transparently and are an accurate reflection of the will of Michigan voters,\u201d it said in a\u00a0detailed fact check\u00a0posted online. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Chris Wallace last year, McDaniel defended her claims of voting \u201cirregularity\u201d in the election. \u201cI think saying that there were problems with 2020 is very real. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s election denying,\u201d McDaniel told Wallace. \u201cI\u2019m from Wayne County. We had a woman send a note saying I\u2019m being told to backdate ballots. We had to look into that. That\u2019s deeply concerning. When you have friends who are poll-watching and being kicked out, that\u2019s deeply concerning. We have every right to look at that.\u201d In the interview,\u00a0Wallace pressed McDaniel if she believed Biden legitimately won the election. \u201cI think there were lots of problems with 2020. Ultimately, he won the election\u00a0but there were lots of problems with the 2020 election,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think he won it fair. I don\u2019t. I\u2019m not going to say that.\u201d NBC\u2019s hiring of McDaniel, however, plays into a recent trend at the\u00a0network\u2019s outlets, which has seemingly softened its stance on Trump as he inches toward the Republican nomination for president. Earlier this month, CNBC hosted Trump for a lengthy phone interview in which the network\u2019s anchors allowed him to peddle lies and conspiracy theories on air\u00a0without scrutiny. MSNBC has even started carrying Trump\u2019s remarks live on television, a practice that the network boasted for years it would not do. Star host Rachel Maddow, who has said carrying Trump\u2019s lies\u00a0on the air\u00a0is dangerous, even objected to the network broadcasting a recent speech from the presumptive Republican nominee, calling it \u201cirresponsible.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/22/media/ronna-mcdaniel-nbc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/01/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_28_business_uber-lyft-minimum-wage-massachusetts", "text": "Uber\u00a0Technologies\u00a0and Lyft\u00a0on Thursday agreed to adopt a $32.50 hourly minimum pay standard for Massachusetts drivers and pay $175 million to settle a lawsuit by the state\u2019s attorney general alleging they improperly treated drivers as independent contractors who can legally receive lower compensation than employees. The companies also agreed to give drivers paid sick leave, accident insurance, and healthcare stipends and to stop funding or supporting a ballot initiative that would have asked voters in November to cement app-based drivers\u2019 status as contractors, Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell said. Uber\u00a0and Lyft in separate statements said the agreement reflected the desire of most drivers to work on their own terms while receiving many of the key benefits that are legally guaranteed to employees. \u201cIn taking this opportunity, we\u2019ve resolved historical liabilities by constructing a new operating model that balances both flexibility and benefits,\u201d said Tony West,\u00a0Uber\u2019s chief legal officer. The agreement requires\u00a0Uber\u00a0to pay $148 million and Lyft to pay $27 million to the state. At least $140 million will be paid out to drivers, according to a court filing. Campbell, a Democrat, made the announcement hours after Massachusetts\u2019 top court\u00a0cleared the way\u00a0for voters to decide whether to approve the industry-backed ballot measure, along with a\u00a0dueling labor-backed proposal\u00a0to allow drivers to unionize that will continue to move forward. It was also the eve of closing arguments in a\u00a0non-jury trial\u00a0in a\u00a0lawsuit\u00a0filed in 2020 by Campbell\u2019s predecessor, now-Governor Maura Healey, over the status of drivers whose services have helped fuel the U.S. gig worker economy. Campbell had been asking a judge to conclude that the state\u2019s 55,000\u00a0Uber\u00a0drivers and 35,000 Lyft drivers are employees under state law and therefore entitled to benefits such as a minimum wage, overtime and earned sick time. Studies have shown that using contractors can cost companies as much as 30% less than employees. \u201cFor years, these companies have underpaid their drivers and denied them basic benefits,\u201d Cambpell said in a statement. \u201cToday\u2019s agreement holds\u00a0Uber\u00a0and Lyft accountable.\u201d The settlement provides for greater benefits and pay for\u00a0Uber\u00a0and Lyft drivers than provided under a similar settlement\u00a0in November with New York state\u00a0and under legislation signed into law in May in Minnesota. Uber\u00a0and Lyft in defending themselves at trial had argued that Campbell\u2019s office misunderstood their business models and that they could be forced to cut or end service in Massachusetts if their drivers were deemed employees. They along with DoorDash\u00a0and Instacart had financially supported Flexibility and Benefits for Massachusetts Drivers, the ballot measure committee behind the proposal to ask voters to deem app-based drivers as contractors. The proposal had also called for providing drivers benefits similar to those in the settlement. After its announcement, Conor Yunits, a spokesperson for the industry-backed campaign, said the group will no longer be moving forward with the initiative. The industry through a $200 million campaign\u00a0had previously in\u00a02020 convinced California voters to pass a measure similar to the one backed by the companies in Massachusetts, solidifying drivers as independent contractors with some benefits.\u00a0Litigation challenging\u00a0that measure is ongoing.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/28/business/uber-lyft-minimum-wage-massachusetts/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/01/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_30_business_barbecue-grills-july-fourth-weber-traeger", "text": "To BBQ or not to BBQ? That is one question on Americans\u2019 minds heading toward July 4 as grills are not as hot of an item as they once were. The grill business saw a massive pandemic-era buying binge, but is now facing consumers worried about inflated meat prices, high interest rates and uncertainty. Many feel no need to upgrade fairly recent purchases. Market leaders like higher-end grill manufacturer Traeger, once a pandemic darling, reported its latest quarter\u2019s grill sales at $76.8 million \u2014 a plunge from the $156.1 million the company raked in during the second quarter of 2021. Best-selling outdoor cooker brand Weber has also seen unit shares decline since 2020, according to data from Traqline. (Weber did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment.) Retailer Home Depot also reported pressure in big-ticket patio and garden equipment, including grills, during its first quarter earnings call in May as the company reported overall dips in sales and earnings. And it\u2019s not just the big brands. Local stores that sell grills and other backyard cooking gear similarly reported demand slacking off.  \u201cIt\u2019s trending down,\u201d said Brian Bushfield, general manager at West Coast BBQ Shop in San Diego, California. He noted a sluggish start to June and a slow Memorial Day, despite the holiday being one of the most popular occasions to purchase new grills. So, what\u2019s going on? Lockdown was a grill (seller)\u2019s best friend It\u2019s not a result of Americans cooking outside on grills less. At least, that\u2019s according to statistics from the Hearth, Patio & Barbecue Association that reported 80% of U.S. homeowners owned a grill or smoker in 2023 \u2014 up from 64% in 2019.\u202fOf the new grill owners surveyed, 27% cited cooking more at home during Covid as the reason for their purchase. Home Depot Senior Merchant of Grills Joe Downey said it isn\u2019t just cookers that make up the retailer\u2019s grill category. Consumables like charcoal pellets and propane tanks drive a large portion of sales, which he says are powered by new customers who purchased grills during the pandemic returning frequently to buy fuel. \u201cMore cooks are cooking at home than ever before,\u201d he said. Roy Morchian, owner of American Royal Hardware in Montclair, New Jersey, told CNN that he saw a bump in the number of grills sold during the pandemic \u2013 around 160 grills sold in 2020 compared to the store\u2019s yearly average range of 80 to 120 grills. And while their sales \u201chave come back to normal\u201d now closer to pre-pandemic levels, he notices new faces have joined familiar ones when purchasing propane tanks to fuel the Weber grills they stock. Most grill makers and retailers seem to agree that the pandemic pulled forward demand for grills and other long-lasting home equipment as people searched for ways to fill their days and entertain their families at home. San Diego Grill Pros owner Jessica Hernandez recounted \u201castronomical\u201d sales numbers and dubbed 2020 their \u201cunicorn year.\u201d Corey Martin, VP of Marketing at Texas Star Grill Shop described droves of people flocking to their Houston branch to buy grills and shelling out thousands of dollars for higher-end models like Weber\u2019s Genesis, which retails between $800 and $1,800, and Traeger\u2019s Timberline, which starts at about $3,000. \u201cIt was like a really busy grocery store,\u201d he said of his shop. But he and his staff knew that 2020 might be an aberration and the windfall might not last. \u201cIt would be stupid to be in a grill business and think that Covid was the new normal,\u201d Martin said. He said retailers who sell grills know it\u2019s a slow growth and seasonal industry. Downey sees Home Depot\u2019s grill sales stabilizing now following the lockdown-driven high. He anticipates that pandemic-purchased grills will reach the end of their life cycle and bring returning buyers with them in 2025. \u201cThe bottom has been reached and we are on the upswing in terms of getting closer to the end of [the grill] life cycle,\u201d he said. A key issue is a grill\u2019s life cycle: an average grill could last about five years and Americans purchased more than 21 million grills and smokers in 2020. When you do the math, it\u2019s clear that the replacement phase still hasn\u2019t kicked in quite yet. Reigniting the market Meanwhile, grill sellers are looking for ways to stoke demand. Beyond running familiar summer promotions for popular grilling days like Memorial Day and Father\u2019s Day, Downey said that Home Depot is trying to encourage young first-time homeowners to buy grills by introducing them to well-known brands at lower price points. Downey said somebody purchasing a $99 Weber kettle later might look to buy the compact Weber Spirit. \u201cThen as they grow, maybe they\u2019ll aspire to get into the Weber Genesis,\u201d he said, referencing the brand\u2019s more expensive model. Ace Hardware is running advertisements promoting its longstanding free assembly and delivery on grills \u2013- from brands such as Big Green Egg, Blackstone, Weber and Traeger \u2013 priced $399 and up, for Ace Rewards members, which is a free program to join. Traeger CEO Jeremy Andrus told CNN of the soft demand period \u201cWe are not waiting for this to end and riding it out.\u201d He pointed to Traeger hosting weekend cooking demonstrations outside of retail stores like Home Depot and Ace Hardware. \u201cIf we have an opportunity to get in front of the consumer and not only explain what a Traeger does but give them an opportunity to taste the food cooked off of a Traeger, it\u2019s a very effective conversion tool,\u201d he said. But even with efforts in marketing, discounting and other special offers, firing up demand in a traditionally slow-growth industry is a challenge, according to Simeon Siegel, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets who follows Traeger. \u201cIf someone has a barbecue, they\u2019re not going to buy another simply because it\u2019s on sale,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the end of the day, if someone doesn\u2019t need to buy a grill, there\u2019s only so many things companies can do to create demand.\u201d And economic trends haven\u2019t helped. Price data from the US Department of Agriculture showed prices of many foods, including beef, rose in 2022 and 2023. \u201cBeef and veal prices have risen the fastest of all categories\u201d in 2024 the USDA said in May. It expects beef and veal prices to rise another 4% this year. And some consumers are abandoning meat entirely. A year and a half ago, Bloomfield, New Jersey, resident Shikhiu Ing traded grilled meat for greens as a part of a conscious health decision. While he describes firing up his grill three times a week during the pandemic, he now finds less use for it after going mostly vegetarian. \u201cIt\u2019s non-functional right now. Grilling vegetables is kind of a chore to be honest,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just faster in the air fryer. Throw some broccoli in there, air fry. You got vegetables.\u201d Hot grill summers are here to stay? The grill industry isn\u2019t a stranger to slumps or about-face shifts in consumer demand. Andrus pointed to grill sales declining in the years following the 2008 recession before returning to growth for the next 10 years as a testament to the industry\u2019s resiliency. \u201cAmericans love to cook outdoors,\u201d he said. \u201cThey always have, they always will.\u201d For Newark, New Jersey, native Ayla Dunkley, cooking outdoors has been a family tradition. \u201cI learned how to grill from my grandfather and my father, so I learned everything from them,\u201d she said. Following her grandfather\u2019s advice, Dunkley replaces her Blackstone cooker every three to five years and waits until the summer season is over to shop at lower prices. Fourth of July cookouts will\u00a0cost $71.22 on average for 10 guests this summer, according to data from the American Farm Bureau Federation. That\u2019s up 5% from last year and up 30% from 2019. Yet Dunkley\u2019s annual plans to celebrate the holiday with her family in Pennsylvania are still on, grill in tow.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/30/business/barbecue-grills-july-fourth-weber-traeger/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/01/2024", "section": "business"}}

He struggled to explain what he would accomplish in a second term. He struggled to respond to Mr. Trump\u2019s provocations. He struggled to hold Mr. Trump accountable for his lies, his failures and his chilling plans. More than once, he struggled to make it to the end of a sentence,\u201d the board wrote in an opinion piece published Friday. \u201cThe greatest public service Mr. Biden can now perform is to announce that he will not continue to run for re-election. As it stands, the president is engaged in a reckless gamble. There are Democratic leaders better equipped to present clear, compelling and energetic alternatives to a second Trump presidency. There is no reason for the party to risk the stability and security of the country by forcing voters to choose between Mr. Trump\u2019s deficiencies and those of Mr. Biden. It\u2019s too big a bet to simply hope Americans will overlook or discount Mr. Biden\u2019s age and infirmity that they see with their own eyes,\u201d the Times also said. The board went on to say it would still support Biden as its \u201cunequivocal pick\u201d if the choice remains between him and former President Donald Trump. The Biden campaign hit back at the editorial board\u2019s critique on Friday evening. \u201cThe last time Joe Biden lost the New York Times editorial board\u2019s endorsement, it turned out pretty well for him,\u201d Biden campaign co-chair Cedric Richmond told CNN. The Times\u00a0endorsed\u00a0two Democratic presidential candidates in 2020: Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren. Biden campaign co-chair Mitch Landrieu told CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins Friday night that he has \u201c100% confidence in Joe Biden,\u201d adding that it will be \u201chis decision alone whether he\u2019s going to continue.\u201d \u201cAnd I think he answered that question for the public today in North Carolina,\u201d Landrieu said on \u201cThe Source.\u201d The New York Times is the latest to critique Biden\u2019s\u00a0debate\u00a0performance, which has set off alarm bells among top Democrats \u2014 leaving some to openly question whether Biden can stay atop of the Democratic ticket. \u201cHe seemed a little disoriented. He did get stronger as the debate went on. But by that time, I think the panic had set in,\u201d longtime Democratic operative and CNN senior political commentator David Axelrod said.

{"id": "2024_06_26_business_economy-election-presidential-debate", "text": "Bill Clinton\u2019s campaign was right on the money when it coined the famous \u201cIt\u2019s the economy, stupid\u201d phrase in 1992. That\u2019s because the economy has consistently ranked among the top \u2014 if not the very top \u2014 voter issues in presidential election after presidential election. The current contest is far from an exception, with close to 90% of respondents in a May ABC News/Ipsos poll indicating that the economy is the most important issue in determining who gets their vote in November. That means it\u2019s all but guaranteed to be a major talking point during Thursday night\u2019s debate, which kicks off at 9 pm ET on CNN. President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump have polar opposite views on the economy \u2014 and both undoubtedly will try to sell you on their visions, policies and records. To make heads or tails of what they say (or if you\u2019re trying to impress anyone you might be watching the debate with), it\u2019s good to make sure you understand the economy we\u2019re in right now. Disclaimer: The topics below are in no way an exhaustive list of everything going on in the US economy, plus, everyone experiences it differently. Unemployment: Low, but with warning signs ahead The nation\u2019s unemployment rate stayed below 4% for 27 months, its longest such streak and a match for a period in the 1960s. That streak ended last month, when the unemployment rate rose to 4% from 3.9%. At the same time, the number of job openings in the US recently fell to a new three-year low, another sign of cooling in the labor market. That means job seekers might find it harder to get hired. In particular, the job market for recent college graduates has weakened. The unemployment rate for bachelor\u2019s degree recipients aged 20 to 29 is above 12%, an almost four-percentage-point increase from a year ago, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Inflation: Elevated, but cooling Inflation slowed more than expected last month, falling to 3.3% from 3.4% in April. By comparison, at this time last year it was 4%, and two years ago it was 9%. But there\u2019s a reason why you\u2019re probably feeling like everything is still really expensive. While discounts are starting to appear more at big-box retailers like Target and Walmart and fast-food giants like McDonald\u2019s and Wendy\u2019s, price cuts aren\u2019t occurring across the board. That\u2019s because when inflation cools off, it simply means that the pace of price increases is slowing. However, it does not mean that the actual prices we pay for goods and services are lower than they were a year ago. Housing: Still unaffordable Home prices are at a record high and have been climbing for 11 straight months as housing shortages persist. That\u2019s partly because many homeowners who locked in ultra-low mortgages during the pandemic don\u2019t want to move and risk having to pay a much higher mortgage rate. Average 30-year fixed-rate mortgages recently hit the highest level of the year. While they\u2019ve started to fall, mortgage rates are still higher than anything seen in the decade before 2022. Mortgage rates are so high in part because inflation is above the Fed\u2019s 2% target. As a result, the central bank has held off cutting interest rates, which would otherwise make it cheaper to get a mortgage. In turn, many would-be homebuyers are renting for longer than they otherwise may have, which is driving rents higher, too.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/business/economy-election-presidential-debate/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/01/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_business_china-adidas-employees-out-corruption-probe-hnk-intl", "text": "Two employees have left Adidas as a result of an ongoing investigation by the German sportswear brand into allegations of corruption in China. Adidas said last week that it was investigating \u201ccompliance violations\u201d in China, a key market for its sportswear, after Chinese state media reported that the company\u2019s executives in the country had been accused of embezzling millions of euros and taking huge kickbacks. \u201cWhile Adidas is investigating this matter together with independent external advisers, evidence has been found that in the interaction with local vendors, one employee violated the company\u2019s code of conduct,\u201d Claudia Lange, head of media relations at the apparel giant, said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cSeparately, a second employee failed to meet the company\u2019s leadership expectations of demonstrating mutual respect and trust,\u201d she said, adding that both had left the company and that the investigation continues. Chinese state media outlet Economic View reported Wednesday that both former employees had worked in marketing for Adidas China. The allegations against Adidas executives were contained in an unsigned letter from people calling themselves employees of Adidas China. The letter was widely publicized online earlier this month and reported by state media outlet Jiemian. Jiemian wrote that the letter had been sent directly to the company\u2019s German headquarters before being shared on social media. Lange told CNN last week that Adidas had received an anonymous letter on June 7 \u201cindicating potential compliance violations in China.\u201d The reported complaint alleged that a senior executive in Greater China who manages Adidas\u2019s marketing budget had embezzled millions of euros and taken kickbacks from external advertising and celebrity agencies. Several members of the executive\u2019s team and other employees were also implicated, according to a copy of the letter published by the Chinese state media outlet. Adidas Greater China\u2019s overall promotional budget amounted to \u20ac250 million ($268 million) a year, including expenses for marketing, branding, and trade fairs, Jiemian reported, citing the letter. The senior manager was also accused of \u201cnepotism\u201d and \u201cworkplace bullying,\u201d including isolating some employees and forcing them to leave, the letter\u2019s authors reportedly said. The complaint also claimed that one of the manager\u2019s subordinates had received \u201cmillions \u2026 from suppliers and physical items such as real estate.\u201d Adidas is the world\u2019s second-largest sportswear retailer. Greater China \u2014 a region that encompasses mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan \u2014 accounts for 15% of the company\u2019s sales.

{"id": "2024_03_15_success_best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund", "text": "The average federal tax refund is more than $3,000, according to the latest data from the IRS. Since the majority of tax filers get a refund, there\u2019s a fair chance you could get hundreds if not thousands of dollars back in overpaid taxes, especially if you\u2019re also owed a refund from your state government. That money may feel like a windfall, and it\u2019s easy to squander it on a lot of little things. But if you\u2019re looking to improve your current financial situation, here are seven ideas to consider. Well, technically six, but you\u2019ll enjoy the seventh the most. 1. Pay off high-rate debt If you are carrying a balance on your credit card and are paying 20% to 30% in interest, make this your first priority to pay down. At such sky-high rates, \u201cthe debt can grow faster than you can pay it off,\u201d said Eric Bronnenkant, a certified financial planner and head of tax at Betterment, a robo-advisory financial services firm that also has a human advice team on hand to help clients. Keyana Russ, a certified financial planner at Four Ponds Financial Planning, concurred that people\u2019s awareness of how much money they\u2019re paying in interest over time doesn\u2019t always register. \u201cWhat I usually see is people paying the minimum, or they\u2019re charging everyday expenses and not paying off the bill at the end of the month. \u2026 They don\u2019t understand how much interest they\u2019re paying,\u201d Russ said. For example, if you\u2019re carrying a $3,000 balance at 27% interest and you only pay a required minimum of $97.50 every month, it will take you 240 months (which is 20 years) just to pay off the $3,000 \u2014 and, in addition, you will have paid $3,044.57 in interest, for a total of $6,044.57, according to Bankrate.com\u2019s calculator. 2. Create or add to an emergency fund You can use your refund to start or bolster an emergency fund. When it comes to costly emergencies, there are many Americans who don\u2019t have at least three months\u2019 worth of living expenses set aside, let alone enough to easily handle an unexpected bill of $1,000. Be sure to stash the money in a high-yield savings account at an FDIC-insured bank, Russ suggested, noting that the best interest rates are typically offered by online banks. If you have high-rate debt and you\u2019re lacking emergency savings, Russ suggested you might use a portion of your refund to attack your debt and the other portion to create an emergency fund. Bronnenkant favors paying off the high-rate debt first, but, if you\u2019re low on emergency savings and need a critical repair to help keep your job \u2014 such as on your car \u2014 he said it might make sense to set aside money for that repair and put the rest toward your credit card or other high-rate debt. 3. Make an extra payment on your mortgage If you\u2019re carrying a mortgage at a high rate (e.g., 7% to 8%), and you\u2019re not saddled with credit card debt, you might consider making an extra payment or two. \u201cIt can make a difference in the long run towards your principal,\u201d Russ said.\u00a0 You can even view it as an additional form of savings, in the sense that you\u2019re saving yourself an extra 7% \ufeffor so in interest on the portion of the principal you\u2019re paying down, Bronnenkant noted. 4. Invest in a Roth IRA If your income qualifies you to contribute to a Roth IRA, you can contribute up to $7,000 this year ($8,000 if you\u2019re at least 50) with after-tax savings. That money will grow untaxed until retirement, at which point your withdrawals will be tax-free and penalty-free after age 59-1/2, assuming the account has been open for at least five years. (And note: You can still make a 2023 Roth contribution until April 15 this year. The contribution limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if you\u2019re age 50 or older. Bolstering your tax-free retirement savings is great.\u00a0But if you need to access some of your money well before you retire, you may take out any part of your contributions tax-free and penalty-free at any time, \ufeffBronnenkant said. You would only be taxed and penalized if you withdrew the earnings on your contributions before age 59-1/2. (For more information on Roth IRA withdrawal rules, here is an easy-to-understand rundown from Charles Schwab.) 5. Contribute enough to your 401(k) in 2024 to get your full employer match Speaking of retirement savings, if you\u2019re not yet contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match from your employer, a refund can make that easier. Say you get $3,000 back. You can put that money in a high-yield savings account to earn interest. Then, on your workplace 401(k) site, change your paycheck contribution levels so that by the end of the year you will have contributed $3,000 more in pre-tax money than you otherwise would have. For instance, say you\u2019re paid every two weeks and you have 20 more paychecks left until the end of the year. You can boost you biweekly contributions by $150 per paycheck ($150 x 20 = $3,000). \u201cYou want to get the max match from your employer,\u201d Bronnenkant said. 6. Invest for shorter-term goals If in the next three to 10 years you expect to buy a home, take a once-in-a-lifetime trip, renovate a room, send your kids to summer camp or have any other expensive goal, you might consider investing your refund in a diversified mix of low-cost, broad market index funds. The shorter term your goal is, the less risk you want to take. If you need the money within three years, you might consider putting your refund in certificates of deposits and US Treasury bonds. But if your goal is five to 10 years out, and you\u2019re comfortable taking on some more risk and are willing to accept fluctuations in the market, Bronnenkant said, you might put no more than 30% of your refund in a stock index fund and 70% in a total market bond fund if your risk tolerance is conservative; or 50% in each if you have a moderate risk tolerance. If you plan on sending your child to college and you have a 529 plan, you can use your refund to boost your contributions to that plan, Russ said. You may also get a tax break for your contribution depending on the state where you live. 7. Have some fun Unless you\u2019re in truly dire financial straits, if you get a large refund, you might set aside a small portion to do whatever you truly enjoy. \u201cSometimes you just want to have fun and not have it be all business,\u201d Russ said. \u201cYou can set aside some of the money to have fun.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/15/success/best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/01/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_19_success_wall-street-bonuses", "text": "Last year wasn\u2019t the most lucrative for Wall Street bankers, but their bonus payouts still easily trounced US median household income. The average Wall Street bonus for 2023 was $176,500, according to estimates that will be released Tuesday morning by New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli. That\u2019s down 2% from the $180,000 recorded in 2022. Both those averages were well below the $240,000 paid out in 2021. That the average bonus was slightly down isn\u2019t surprising. Wall Street earnings last year were mixed, and merger and acquisition activity was underwhelming. \u201cWall Street\u2019s profits were up 1.8% in 2023, but firms have taken a more cautious approach to compensation and more employees have joined the securities industry, which accounts for the slight decline in the average bonus,\u201d DiNapoli said in a statement. Nevertheless, a little perspective: The average Wall Street bonus, which comes on top of the nearly half-a-million-dollar average Wall Street salary, was itself almost 2.5 times higher than the median US household income of $74,580, according to Census data for 2022. Wall Street bonuses and general employment in the securities industry provide vital revenue streams for the New York State and New York City economies, accounting most recently for 27% of the state\u2019s tax collections and 7% of city tax revenue, according to DiNapoli\u2019s office. The securities industry \ufeffin the city employed roughly 198,500 people last year, up from 191,600 the year before. And DiNapoli estimates that 1 in 11 of the city\u2019s jobs are either directly or indirectly associated with the industry. The total estimated bonus pool for 2023 was\u00a0slightly lower than the year before and is\u00a0projected to bring in $4 million less in state income tax revenue and $2 million less for the city revenue than bonuses in 2022 did. Still, DiNapoli noted, \u201cWhile these bonuses affect income tax revenues for the state and city, both budgeted for larger declines so the impact on projected revenues should be limited.\u201d It should be noted that the comptroller\u2019s numbers only reflect the bonuses paid to securities industry employees working for firms based in New York City. Beyond bringing in tax revenue for government coffers, Wall Street workers contribute substantially to the local Gotham economy. DiNapoli said that more employees in financial services (65%) are working in-office on any given day compared to 58% working in other industries in the city, at least as of September 2023. And that securities industry employees use the subway more than other workers in the city. All in, he estimates that Wall Street is responsible for roughly 14% of economic activity in the city. As critical as that is, the city and state are about much more than just Wall Street. \u201cThe securities industry\u2019s continued strength should not overshadow the broader economic picture in New York, where we need all sectors to enjoy full recovery from the pandemic,\u201d DiNapoli said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/19/success/wall-street-bonuses/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/01/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_30_business_boeing-plea-deal", "text": "The US Justice Department is nearing an agreement with Boeing that would include a corporate monitor and a fine in exchange for a guilty plea to criminal charges, according to lawyers representing the families of victims of two fatal 737 Max crashes, who harshly rebuked the offer as a \u201csweetheart deal.\u201d The criminal charges and potential plea deal come after repeated safety failures at Boeing that have resulted in multiple federal investigations and a sharp rebuke from airlines, customers, lawmakers and regulators. Criminal charges against a major corporation like Boeing are rare and would represent a serious blow to the company\u2019s already\u00a0precarious financial situation\u00a0and further damage its\u00a0battered reputation. But the victims\u2019 families said they were furious that Boeing may avoid trial, saying the government is letting the company off the hook for the deaths of their loved ones. \u201cI can tell you that the families are very unhappy and angered with DOJ\u2019s decisions and proposal,\u201d said Robert Clifford, lead counsel in the civil litigation against Boeing, in a statement. \u201cThere is no accountability, no admission that Boeing\u2019s admitted crime caused the 346 deaths, and the families will most certainly object before Judge Reed O\u2019Connor and ask that he reject the plea if Boeing accepts.\u201d Clifford and Paul Cassell represent many family members of the 2018 Lion Air crash and\u00a02019 Ethiopian Air crash\u00a0victims of Boeing 737 Max jets. They and some of the families they represent were briefed by the Justice Department Sunday about the plea deal. The deal would include three years of probation, a \u201csmall\u201d fine and and a monitor to ensure safety compliance, Cassell told CNN. Other specific terms of the proposed offer were not immediately known, and CNN has not reviewed the proposal first-hand. Bloomberg first reported the potential plea deal Sunday. Boeing declined to comment, and the Department of Justice did not respond to a request for comment. Violating Boeing\u2019s previous agreement Last month, the Justice Department notified Boeing that its recent string of safety failures and production problems constituted a breach of the terms of\u00a0its\u00a02021 agreement in which the company avoided criminal charges for two fatal 737 Max crashes. A\u00a0door plug blew off an Alaska Airlines flight\u00a0shortly after takeoff in January, and the investigations that followed revealed a series of quality errors and safety gaps. As a result, the Department of Justice said Boeing is subject to criminal prosecution, but it has not publicly announced its decision about whether it will prosecute the case. Last week, prosecutors urged the Justice Department to file criminal charges. Boeing will have by the end of the week to determine whether to accept the plea deal or go to trial. The deadline for the Justice Department to file criminal charges in the case is July 7. Cassell said the families were upset that the Justice Department deal excluded the prosecution of individuals at Boeing. \u201cThe deal will not acknowledge, in any way, that Boeing\u2019s crime killed 346 people.\u00a0It also appears to rest on the idea that Boeing did not harm any victim,\u201d Cassell said in a statement. Although the Justice Department acknowledged the families\u2019 strong desire to take Boeing\u2019s criminal case to trial, the families\u2019 lawyers said the Department of Justice feared it would be unable to prove the charges beyond a reasonable doubt \u2014 the higher standard of proof necessary for a conviction in a criminal trial. A broken safety culture More than a dozen whistleblowers have come forward against Boeing in recent years, and the number has grown substantially since the\u00a0door plug incident in January. Last week, for example, a whistleblower from a contractor for Spirit Aerosystems, a Boeing manufacturing partner, said he notified the company of wide gaps in a key part of 787 Dreamliner planes that posed \u201ccatastrophic\u201d danger to passengers. As part of its plan to shore up its safety program, Boeing said it was looking to repurchase Spirit to bring manufacturing of its planes fully in house. Boeing spun off Spirit in 2005. Boeing and Spirit reportedly came to terms on a deal Sunday, according to Reuters, but the deal has not been publicly disclosed and Boeing declined to comment to CNN. The Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board have opened multiple investigations into Boeing because of its ongoing quality and safety failures. The FAA has said a\u00a0six-week audit of Boeing\u2019s facilities\u00a0conducted in the late winter found multiple problems with Boeing\u2019s production practices. A separate\u00a0report\u00a0found \u201cgaps\u201d in Boeing\u2019s safety culture, including a disconnect between management and employees, and fears among employees about retaliation for reporting safety concerns. Boeing\u2019s CEO Dave Calhoun earlier this month\u00a0apologized for Boeing\u2019s recent safety failures\u00a0in testimony delivered to a Senate committee but pushed back on claims the company retaliated against those who brought safety issues to light. Calhoun said Boeing is \u201cfar from perfect,\u201d and acknowledged the company will not easily regain the public\u2019s trust.

{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_judges-stern-rebuke-of-elon-musks-x-gives-researchers-fresh-hope", "text": "A federal judge\u2019s decision this week reprimanding Elon Musk\u2019s X will have reverberating effects on efforts to hold influential online platforms accountable, legal experts and advocacy groups say. On Monday, District Judge Charles Breyer dismissed and excoriated a lawsuit by X against online watchdog group Center for Countering Digital Hate as an attempt to silence the non-profit group for sounding alarms about hate speech on the platform. Breyer wrote in Monday\u2019s order that the lawsuit was \u201cunabashedly\u201d about \u201cpunishing\u201d reports written by CCDH, which X had accused of campaigning to drive away its advertisers. Breyer held that the reports were \u201cunquestionably\u201d protected by the group\u2019s free speech rights. Now, that decision could embolden other research groups and Musk critics who have faced legal threats from the billionaire. The CCDH case \u2014 in the US District Court for the Northern District of California \u2014\u00a0has been widely viewed as a bellwether for research and accountability on X, where Musk has restored the accounts of previously banned White supremacists and spreaders of misinformation and where Musk himself has amplified various conspiracy theories. And CCDH is not the only organization that has faced attacks by self-proclaimed \u201cfree speech absolutist\u201d Musk after criticizing or raising concerns about his platform. \u201cThis is an important decision that sees Elon Musk\u2019s lawsuit for what it is \u2014 an effort to punish his critics for constitutionally protected speech and to deter researchers from studying his platform,\u201d said Alex Abdo, litigation director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, which had filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the case arguing that private companies should not be allowed to use breach of contract claims to punish criticism. \u201cSociety needs reliable and ethical research into social media platforms, and often that research relies on being able to study publicly available posts,\u201d Abdo said. X said it plans to appeal Breyer\u2019s decision. Musk\u2019s threats against X critics In his first year as owner of X, formerly known as Twitter, Musk threatened legal action against the Anti-Defamation League for defamation, as well as against Microsoft and Meta for allegedly improper data and trade secret access, respectively. None of those threats ever amounted to real lawsuits. He did, however, sue the progressive media watchdog Media Matters over its\u00a0analysis\u00a0highlighting antisemitic and pro-Nazi content on X, alleging that the group\u2019s testing methodology was not representative of how real users experience the site and that the report was designed to drive away advertisers. Legal experts have described that case as \u201cweak\u201d on the merits and as a \u201cbogus\u201d attempt to chill criticism of X. This week\u2019s court decision may be only a temporary setback in Musk\u2019s wider plan to stifle criticism, said Media Matters CEO Angelo Carusone. Musk\u2019s new playbook, Carusone said, enlists the help of sympathetic Republican attorneys general to investigate independent reporting organizations and tie them up in legal proceedings. The states of Texas and Missouri each announced probes into Media Matters following X\u2019s lawsuit against the group, to which Musk responded, \u201cGreat!\u201d As recently as Monday, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey filed a petition in state court seeking to compel Media Matters\u2019 cooperation with his investigation. The filing came a week after he appeared with Musk in a live event on X \u2014 which Carusone said shows how Musk hopes to deputize the power of government to silence his critics. \u201cThey have every reason to do it,\u201d Carusone said of the AGs\u2019 investigations. \u201cThey get the political benefits, they get the attention. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any cost to them yet. And if they are successful at developing this new playbook, this new terrain, legally, then it\u2019s going to pave the way for them to just use this tool and tactic over and over and over again.\u201d A representative for X did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Carusone\u2019s claims. Researchers face hurdles to studying on-platform behavior Researchers from non-profits and academic institutions have had a harder time studying X since Musk\u2019s takeover in 2022. Academics need large samples of posts, shares, likes and other data to study social media trends in mis- and disinformation, public health, elections and other key topics. But one of Musk\u2019s first changes at X was to put access to platform data behind a steep paywall. Researchers and civil society groups said the new subscription fees \u2014 costing up to $2.5 million a year \u2014\u00a0were \u201coutrageously expensive\u201d and made it impossible to do their work, reducing transparency of a critical platform. The change may have forced some researchers to rely more heavily on first-person observational data to draw conclusions about user behavior on X. Groups like CCDH have also used automated \u201cscraping\u201d of publicly viewable content from X rather than paying the company for data directly, a tactic that helped give rise to X\u2019s initial lawsuit. Efforts by X and other social media companies to limit research transparency makes them less accountable to the public at best and, at worst, could mask malicious behavior, said David Karpf, an associate professor in the School of Media and Public Affairs at George Washington University. \u201cWe need independent research to have any real measure of what\u2019s going on at X/Twitter. Musk is only ever going to release data that makes his company look good,\u201d Karpf said. \u201cThese platforms are too big and too vital to the spread of information to be left unmonitored.\u201d \u201cThis is an election year,\u201d Karpf added, \u201cand the platforms are taking steps to make it harder to monitor how their services are used for malignant ends.\u201d Free Press, another media accountability organization that has been critical of Musk\u2019s leadership of X and which called for advertisers to pause their spending on the platform shortly after his takeover, also celebrated Breyer\u2019s ruling as potentially removing at least one hurdle that watchdog organizations face. \u201cThe guardrails for democracy are hanging by a thread and we have dwindling insights into platform practices as researchers face lawsuits, congressional subpoenas and other scare tactics,\u201d said Nora Benavidez, senior counsel and director of digital rights at Free Press. Ultimately, Benavidez called the ruling \u201ca reminder that platform accountability is essential and will inevitably prevail when up against bullies like Musk who try to silence us.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/judges-stern-rebuke-of-elon-musks-x-gives-researchers-fresh-hope/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/01/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_27_media_nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over", "text": "Only 80 hours elapsed between NBC News announcing Ronna McDaniel as a paid contributor and the network ousting her from that very role. But for the leadership at NBC Universal News Group, those were 80\u00a0painful hours. On Tuesday evening, following another full day in which the media rumor mill churned at warp speed, NBCU News Group boss Cesar Conde sent staff a memo, notifying his troops that he had reversed his decision to welcome the former Republican National Committee chair to \u201cthe team.\u201d \u201cAfter listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor,\u201d Conde said, adding that he wanted to \u201cpersonally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down.\u201d Conde had no real choice. The embattled NBCU boss, who I\u2019m told dealt with the crisis from an unknown location outside of 30 Rock, was facing an unprecedented rebellion from his most high-profile stars, who one by one went on the air and excoriated leadership\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel. The only aspect of Conde\u2019s note that was surprising was the fact that it came 48 hours late, allowing what started off as a crisis to fester and balloon into one of the worst corporate public relations calamities in recent memory. \u201cWhat a sh*t show!\u201d a media executive exclaimed to me Tuesday shortly after Conde relieved McDaniel of her NBC News credentials. In his note, Conde said he took \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for McDaniel\u2019s hire. But, he also did point the finger, telling staffers that hiring her was \u201ca collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team.\u201d Indeed, multiple people familiar with the matter have told me that the infighting among NBC executives over who was at fault for the disaster has reached a fever pitch, with various factions of the NBCU News Group assigning blame to others. Regardless of who is to blame, the entire affair made clear who is actually in control of the company \u2014 and it\u2019s not Conde & Co. Despite the NBCU C-suite digging their heels in the sand as they resisted dumping McDaniel for days, they were ultimately forced to succumb to pressure from their talent. As a second media executive commented to me, it is now \u201cvery clear who is in charge\u201d after the \u201cweak leadership was put on full display.\u201d \u201cHas Cesar lost the room?\u201d wondered a third media executive. While the Peacock family argues over who was really at fault, the company is facing a fresh public relations mess. Led by Donald Trump, right-wing personalities are already assailing the network as being overrun with intolerant woke leftists. \u201cThese Radical Left Lunatics are CRAZY and the top people at NBC ARE WEAK,\u201d Trump raged on his Truth Social platform. Ari Fleischer, who served as press secretary under President George W. Bush, wrote on X: \u201cWhat NBC is saying is if you\u2019re for Trump, you don\u2019t belong. Good. Let NBC be for Democrats only.\u201d Of course, that narrative is intellectually dishonest. The objection to McDaniel from both within and outside of NBCU was not that she is a Republican. It wasn\u2019t even that she was a Trump-supporting Republican. No, the objection stemmed from the fact that McDaniel was an active participant in the plot to subvert the 2020 vote. And, in addition to that disgraceful history, she had a lengthy track record smearing NBC News and MSNBC. Nevertheless, NBCU will now have to contend with such dishonest attacks being leveled by the right, which will follow them in the days, months, and even years to come. As unfair as it may be, they will certainly damage the network\u2019s brand in Republican circles \u2014 a place it had gone through great pains to appeal to. NBCU will also have to grapple with McDaniel, who spent the last 24 hours or so interviewing lawyers as she gears up for a possible legal fight with the network, according to a person familiar with the matter. The rift between McDaniel and NBCU had grown to such an extent by Tuesday that she was not informed by network brass that she had been dismissed, I\u2019m told. Instead, McDaniel learned of her ouster in press reports. While NBCU is being beaten up on the right, the company\u2019s leadership was quickly praised by its journalists and top stars. Shortly after Conde sent out his memo, Rachel Maddow appeared on Joy Reid\u2019s show, where the two lauded Conde for reversing course. \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/27/media/nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/01/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_06_25_business_ntsb-findings-ohio-derailment", "text": "Norfolk Southern on Tuesday faced harsh criticism from regulators for its decisions immediately after a February 2023 derailment in East Palestine, Ohio. During an all-day hearing in the town itself, hosted by the National Transportation Safety Board, the harshest criticism focused on the railroad\u2019s advocating for a controlled explosion and burn of five tank cars full of vinyl chloride, a toxic chemical three days after the derailment. Norfolk Southern told public officials who authorized the controlled burn, known as a vent and burn procedure, that it was the only way to prevent a catastrophic and uncontrolled explosion. But the NTSB staff and board members insisted at the hearing Tuesday that was not the case. Paul Stancil, an NTSB hazardous materials investigator, said that representatives from Oxy Vinyl, the shipper who owned the five tank cars of vinyl chloride, did not believe the procedure was justified by the facts available at the time. But Stancil said that information was not communicated to the public officials who had to make the final decision. \u201cNorfolk Southern\u2026 compromised the integrity of the vent and burn decision by withholding complete and accurate expert opinion and information from the incident commander,\u201d Stancil said. \u201cVent and burn is a seldom-used procedure,\u201d he continued. \u201c(It) should only be used when there is a high probability of catastrophic tank shell failure.\u201d He said that was not the case here, as evidence from the scene showed no evidence that an uncontrolled explosion was likely. In a statement, Norfolk Southern defended the decision, stating it made the recommendation based on the best available information at the time and that it did not withhold any information. \u201cThe NTSB mischaracterized the basis of the recommendation,\u201d said the railroad\u2019s statement. \u201cSeveral key factors indicated the strong possibility of a catastrophic, uncontrolled explosion.\u201d \u201cThe vent and burn effectively avoided a potential uncontrolled explosion,\u201d Norfolk said elsewhere in its statement. \u201cThere was no loss of life, injuries, or damage to property, and contractors took steps to manage environmental impact.\u201d NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy harshly criticized Norfolk\u2019s statement, calling it \u201cinsulting\u201d and an attempt to shift blame to the public officials who listened to Norfolk\u2019s recommendation. The public officials \u201cdid absolutely nothing wrong, who did a phenomenal job with the limited information they had in a very chaotic situation,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s disgusting that anyone would say that.\u201d Previously, Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio and others had suggested the rail company wanted the controlled burn because that would be faster than draining the cars, which would enable Norfolk Southern to resume operations faster. Homendy said Tuesday said that Norfolk Southern executives met with board members and argued the NTSB should \u201cput to rest the quote-unquote rumor that Norfolk Southern made the decision to vent and burn in order to move trains.\u201d \u201cIt is not our role to defend Norfolk Southern. We\u2019re here to protect the American people and the traveling public,\u201d she said. Homendy said that she was \u201cdeeply troubled by how NS conducted this investigation,\u201d including delaying or not providing information and said she twice threatened to issue subpoenas to get information. The railroad\u2019s actions during the investigation were, Homendy said, \u201cunprecedented and reprehensible.\u201d Norfolk Southern said in a statement Tuesday that it \u201ccooperated fully and ethically with the investigation, with full transparency.\u201d \u201cOur communications with NTSB staff and board members were always motivated by a desire to ensure they had all the relevant information for their independent evaluation and by a shared commitment to advance rail safety,\u201d the company said.

{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit", "text": "When Apple launched its first Mac computer in 1984, with its iconic Mac smiley-face \u201chello\u201d greeting, it wanted to differentiate itself in the fledgling PC market. The Mac was approachable with its friendly, innovative design \u2013 Apple\u2019s way of setting the Mac apart in the confusing PC landscape. That consumer-friendly mantra still exists today, with Apple carefully curating an easy-breezy yet controlled user experience across its products, including the billions of iPhones used around the world. But the Biden administration believes Apple took that too far. On Thursday, the Department of Justice sued Apple for illegally monopolizing the smartphone market. In a press conference, the government provided a long list of how Apple has allegedly squashed competition with restrictive app store terms, high fees and its \u201cwalled-garden\u201d approach, restricting how third-party companies interact with its brands and services. The company denied the lawsuit\u2019s allegations and said it plans to fight them. Apple added that the lawsuit could empower the government \u201cto take a heavy hand in designing people\u2019s technology.\u201d But if successful, the lawsuit could ripple across Apple\u2019s products and services. Although the suit could take years to play out, here\u2019s a closer look what it may eventually mean for iPhone users: Changes to the App Store If found liable, the company could be forced to change a number of things. One such change is how iPhone users could get greater access to \u201csuper apps\u201d that have been largely restricted before. The term refers to one-stop-shop apps that allow for messaging, ordering food, payment processing and other capabilities all within one platform.  According to Dipanjan Chatterjee, a principal analyst at market research firm Forrester, super apps most threaten Apple\u2019s preeminence in the lives of its customers. \u201cAn offering like WeChat, dubbed China\u2019s everything app, can provide an alternative to the Apple ecosystem for people to communicate, bank, share memories, talk to businesses and more,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cWhat Apple fears most is becoming irrelevant to its customers.\u201d At the same time, super apps like WeChat are created by larger companies and could, therefore, put some smaller companies at a disadvantage. And the concept hasn\u2019t been welcomed much in the US anyway. The US government, however, could argue that lack of interest may be due to Apple\u2019s high share of the smartphone market and its resistance to offer super apps in its store, Chatterjee said. Better interoperability Apple may also be required to offer more support for cross-platform messaging, an issue the company previously said it\u2019s already working on. The company lets iPhone users send high-quality photos and videos to one another, but similar texts to Android phones are slower and grainy. It also maintains those messages in green bubbles, creating a kind of class divide, critics argue. In November, the company said it will add new features, such as read receipts, typing indicators, better support for group chats and higher quality media sharing of images and videos, across platforms to help close the gap. Apple\u2019s move to add support for the standard called RCS (rich communication services) is intended to roll out later this year. RCS is considered the replacement to alternatives such as SMS, or short messaging service, and can work over both Wi-Fi and mobile data. The change followed pressure from both regulators and competitors to more seamlessly work across operating systems. The European Union\u2019s Digital Markets Act, for example, requires companies to make their key services interoperable between platforms. The US government could require the same. More open services Another likely change is how hardware from other companies, such as smartwatches, will interact with the Apple range of devices and software, including the iPhone and Apple\u2019s services like Fitness+. The company has also required Apple Watch users to own iOS devices as a way to keep them locked into its existing ecosystem. Chatterjee said making this change would have both positives and negatives. \u201cThe net result would reside somewhere along the spectrum of access to more and cheaper options but also the devaluation of the customer experience that is so highly prized by Apple\u2019s customers,\u201d he said. The Biden administration has also taken issue with Apple\u2019s lack of support for mobile cloud services. Loosening this could allow users to access games and other cloud-based apps without having to pay for pricey hardware. Inside the debate The DOJ lawsuit claims Apple\u2019s behavior has illegally hindered competition, kept its customers locked into its products and prevented other companies from innovating. Although the Biden administration will have to prove these harms, some critics say any potential changes Apple could make will negatively impact the user experience. David McQueen, a research director at ABI Research, said he recognizes that the content and applications market should be open, and Apple needs to avoid monopolistic advantages that can restrict competition, push up prices or block innovation. But Apple\u2019s success stems in part to its tight grip on its products and services, keeping things intuitive and seamless. \u201cIf Apple is forced to comply, it could potentially spell the end to the provision of this consistent and unified user experience, although by the same token, consumers will be open to a greater choice of apps and services, helping more developers and providers,\u201d McQueen said. Chatterjee noted some people are drawn to the Apple family of products precisely because of the carefully managed ecosystem\u2019s ease of use. Apple may have to work that much harder to preserve the integrity of its experience, but any changes probably won\u2019t be enough to make customers to leave and go elsewhere. \u201cThe vast majority of Apple customers would probably be happier with some more choice and lower prices as long as it did not hamper their levels of customer experience, which is threatened by the less control Apple has over the experience,\u201d Chatterjee said. But he added those currently outside of the Apple ecosystem will likely benefit by \u201cplugging in opportunistically without having to go all in with Apple.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/01/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_29_business_india-adani-slum-redevelopment-concerns-intl-hnk-dst", "text": "When Masoom Ali Shaikh arrived in Mumbai in 1974 as a young man from northern India, the patch of land where he set up shop was \u201cjust a creek with no proper road and garbage all around,\u201d he said. Fifty years later, that swampy area \u2014 once a fishing village and rubbish dump \u2014 is now Dharavi, one of Asia\u2019s biggest slums and a bustling hub of industry in India\u2019s financial capital. Famously depicted in the 2008 Oscar-winning film \u201cSlumdog Millionaire,\u201d Dharavi is a\u00a0cacophonous maze of small businesses on every corner, from bakeries to butchers to barbers. These shops service roughly one million residents living cheek by jowl in cramped buildings and narrow alleys. Many of them are migrants and artisans who brought the crafts of their home states to establish businesses in the sprawling 500-acre slum. These small-scale enterprises, which generate a collective annual turnover of more than $1 billion by some estimates, are a crucial source of livelihood for many families, some of whom have lived in Dharavi for generations. Shaikh is one of them. After arriving in Dharavi from his home state Uttar Pradesh, he set up a shoe-making business which allowed him to support six family members over the years, even opening a second shoe store for his daughter to operate. However, many residents fear their livelihoods could now be at risk as the slum prepares to undergo a drastic transformation, overseen by one of Asia\u2019s richest men. Over the decades, there have been several failed attempts to redevelop Dharavi, a process which experts say has always been politically fraught for several reasons: the sheer scale and density of the slum and the high value of its land in central Mumbai, for starters. Residents and authorities point to the slum\u2019s myriad problems, including extreme crowdedness and poor sanitation. Many residents have no access to running water or clean toilets and suffer from various health problems. In some poorly ventilated areas, dust perpetually hangs in the air and smoke wafts from nearby workshops. That could change with this newest plan, led by billionaire and infrastructure tycoon Gautam Adani, founder of the Adani Group, who briefly ousted Jeff Bezos as the world\u2019s second-wealthiest person in 2022. \u201cA new chapter of pride and purpose is beginning. It is a historic opportunity for us to create a new Dharavi of dignity, safety and inclusiveness,\u201d Adani wrote in a message on his company\u2019s website after winning the bid to redevelop the area in 2022. He vowed to \u201ccreate a state-of-the-art world-class city, which will reflect a resurgent, self-assured, growing India finding its new place on the global stage as the 21st century belongs to India.\u201d But his vision of a new Dharavi has been met with mixed reactions, from hopeful residents ready for change to skeptics who have heard empty rhetoric for years. Some are vehemently against the proposal, with demonstrators taking to the streets in protest, concerned that Adani\u2019s plan could imperil their homes and businesses. \u201cWhen redevelopment happens, the only thing I want is to be relocated to the same place,\u201d Shaikh told CNN during a visit to his workshop in April, speaking as his employees hammered out soles and manipulated leather onto shoe moulds. \u201cIf I am thrown into some different area, I will lose all my business and my livelihood,\u201d he added. \u201cMy vendors and buyers will not know where I am moved, which would harm my business.\u201d Lofty promises Migrants have been flocking to Dharavi for more than a century, according to Mumbai authorities, many settling there because it was free and unregulated government-owned land. Almost from the start, Dharavi was defined by its industries: from the traditional potters of Gujarat who began arriving in the late 1800s, to leather tanners from Tamil Nadu and embroidery workers from Uttar Pradesh. The slum\u2019s growth reflected that of Mumbai itself, a diverse city famous for attracting Bollywood hopefuls and job-seekers from across India. Throughout the country, migrants and poorer populations often settle on \u201cperipheral lands, unwanted lands, because they\u2019re seen as hazardous in some way or uninhabitable,\u201d said Lalitha Kamath, a professor of urban planning and policy at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences in Mumbai. In Dharavi\u2019s case, \u201cthey built a habitable place \u2026 they reclaimed it from marshy land to something today that\u2019s really valuable,\u201d she added. But because of its informal nature, Dharavi remained undeveloped and haphazard for many years. It wasn\u2019t until the 1970s that the government made basic improvements: building key roads, laying sewers and water lines and providing residents with taps, toilets and electricity. For decades, the government struggled to find developers and builders who could carry out the expensive, logistically complicated task of redeveloping Dharavi from top to bottom. There were also many questions at play: Which residents would be re-located, and to where? How would business owners be compensated? Who would be eligible? \u201cAll slum redevelopment is quite fraught,\u201d Kamath said. But Dharavi had unique challenges due to the size of its population, the importance of its economy, and the value of the land \u2014 surrounded by affluent commercial districts in the heart of the city, close enough to the airport that arriving planes can see the sprawl of the slum from the air. After years of stalled progress and failed tendering processes, Adani\u2019s company won the right to redevelop Dharavi with a 50 billion rupee ($612 million) bid, Reuters reported at the time. It\u2019s expected to take seven years to complete, and is the latest mega-project taken on by Adani Enterprises, which already supplies electricity in Mumbai. His promises are lofty. About a million people will be \u201crehabilitated and resettled,\u201d with both residential homes and businesses up for redevelopment, he said in the message on his website. And, he vowed, residents will have better healthcare and recreational facilities, open spaces, a hospital and school, and more, he said. Ineligible residents who can\u2019t be rehoused within Dharavi will be given relocation options instead. But some residents aren\u2019t convinced. \u201cFor the last 30 years, we are dreaming and hearing about redevelopment, but nothing has taken place,\u201d said Dilip Gabekar, 60, who was born in Dharavi and works for a non-profit aiding women and children in the slum. \u201cOnly during elections, there is noise about redeveloping\u00a0Dharavi,\u201d he added, speaking to CNN weeks before Mumbai went to the polls in May in a nationwide election that ultimately saw Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his far-right Bharatiya Janata Party win another five-year term. \u201cBut once elections are over, the talks about redevelopment also die down,\u201d he added, despite Adani having won the bid long before the most recent general election. In response to CNN\u2019s request for comment, a spokesperson from the Dharavi Redevelopment Project Private Ltd (DRPPL) said the project was \u201ccommitted to fulfilling Dharavi\u2019s needs and providing residents with new homes with better amenities, accessibility, and resources.\u201d They added that they are exploring \u201call possible options\u201d to protect livelihoods and businesses, and to help raise people\u2019s incomes \u2014 for instance, by consolidating supply chains, giving all businesses tax refunds for five years and launching job initiatives for youth and women. Who gets a free house? Chief among residents\u2019 worries is their eligibility under Adani\u2019s plan, which could determine who gets a free new apartment in the redeveloped space and who may have to move elsewhere on their own dime. According to the DRPPL spokesperson, ground-floor residents who lived in Dharavi before the year 2000 will be granted a free unit within the area that is at least 350 square feet. Higher-floor residents, or those who lived there between 2000 and 2011, will receive a 300-square-foot home following a one-time payment of 250,000 rupees (about $3,000), located within 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) of Dharavi. Those who moved to Dharavi after 2011 will also receive a 300-square-foot home within the same radius, but will have to pay rent to the government. All apartments, either in or near Dharavi, will have separate bedrooms, toilets and kitchens, the spokesperson said. The plan is a collaboration between Adani and Maharashtra state authorities. The land itself will remain government-owned. With the last survey conducted in Dharavi 15 years ago, a firm hired by Adani is now going door to door to collect residents\u2019 information. That could spell trouble for many residents who never got the proper documents to prove their long-term tenancy. \u201cThere is no alternative for someone who has no proper paperwork,\u201d said Gabekar, the NGO worker.\u00a0Many of those deemed ineligible can\u2019t afford to relocate to the housing options provided by Adani, he added. Even those with the right papers are worried. Shaikh, the shoemaker, showed CNN his tenancy and business documents. They\u2019re written in smeared blue ink, laminated and kept carefully tucked away in a drawer. \u201cI have enough papers to prove that I have been in this place for a long time,\u201d he said. But, he added, many businesses have changed hands over the years, leaving new owners without the proper documents. Baburao Mane, a former elected state assembly member affiliated with the opposition party, and a Dharavi native himself, has led some of the most vocal protests against the Adani plan, including a rally in December that saw thousands of people march to Adani\u2019s offices in Mumbai. Only about 50,000 residents, about 5% of the population, have valid papers, Mane estimated. He claimed that the ongoing survey would bring that number down further. \u201cThey should make no difference between valid and non-valid papers to allot places. Anyone who has land in\u00a0Dharavi\u00a0should be given land during the redevelopment,\u201d he said. When asked about concerns over proving eligibility, the DRPPL spokesperson said its plan had \u201csuitable redressal mechanisms to address such eventualities.\u201d Even if eligible residents get re-housed within Dharavi, there are concerns over space. Often, several generations of a family live within cramped multi-story buildings. But only the ground-floor residents will receive the free housing, leaving about 700,000 upper-floor residents ineligible, NDTV reported. \u201cAll the houses in Dharavi have two or three floors \u2026 I have 15 family members who stay above each other (in the same building),\u201d said Neeta Jadhav, a 46-year-old resident who has lived in Dharavi for 26 years, and who has the documents to prove eligibility. \u201cIf we are all put in one small apartment there will be a lot of conflict, so the developer should consider giving us a bigger space,\u201d she said. Mane, the former politician and protest leader, said the group was demanding 500 square feet for each Dharavi household, vowing to \u201cnot let even one house be demolished\u201d until the government agrees to their conditions. Hope and mistrust Despite the pushback from some, there is uniform agreement among residents that Dharavi does need redevelopment. It\u2019s just a question of how, and who can be trusted with such a mammoth project. \u201cI will be happy if development takes place,\u201d said resident Jadhav. \u201cI want my children to have a better life, and move from here to a place that has proper amenities like a good school and a park for them to play.\u201d \u201cIf Adani gives what he has promised, then our life will improve for sure,\u201d she added. And there are some who are enthusiastically in favor of Adani\u2019s plan. \u201cIf Adani redevelops\u00a0Dharavi, it will be good for us as we don\u2019t want to stay\u00a0in Dharavi\u00a0any longer,\u201d said 42-year-old potter Dhanshuk Purshottamwala, whose family has lived in the area and run the pottery business for generations. He hopes Adani\u2019s plan will end that family tradition, with all their necessary papers in order. \u201cI don\u2019t want my children to be living the way I am,\u201d he said, speaking to CNN from his workshop where wet and drying pots line the walls and floors. \u201cI don\u2019t teach my children this skill, I want them to study and have a better life.\u201d While the redevelopment is a massive challenge, Adani is behind some of India\u2019s most ambitious infrastructure projects. He is India\u2019s largest airport operator and\u00a0owns India\u2019s biggest private port operator and private thermal power operator. He\u2019s also one of the country\u2019s largest developers and operators of coal mines, and is simultaneously building the world\u2019s biggest clean energy plant. However, he\u2019s a relative newcomer in the field of slum redevelopment and affordable housing, said Kamath, adding that the lack of affordable housing is what prompted people to set up informal settlements in the first place. And for most residents that CNN spoke to, their hopes for change are dimmed by deep distrust of Adani\u2019s conglomerate and the city government. Several pointed to the 2023 fraud allegations against the Adani Group, which sparked an ongoing investigation by India\u2019s regulators and lost the company over $100 billion in value in a stock market meltdown.\u00a0In January, the country\u2019s top court ordered the regulators to quickly finish their investigation\u00a0and said no further probes were needed, a decision Adani celebrated at the time. His representatives have called the allegations baseless and malicious. Others residents complained about a lack of transparency, saying they had received little official communication and were not included in meetings about the redevelopment, leaving them in the dark about the details or timing of the plan. This is common across many slum redevelopments in India, said Kamath, describing these projects as top-down, with power held by a small group of private developers and state officials. \u201cFolks from the community will very rarely get much space at the table,\u201d she said. It\u2019s one reason why \u201cthere are concerns with all kinds of redevelopment projects that have been proposed, not just this one, because they usually don\u2019t do justice to every group that lives there or has claim to that space, who has made it what it is today,\u201d she said. Then, there\u2019s an ongoing lawsuit by a rival company that alleged the Maharashtra state government had improperly canceled an original 2018 bidding process\u00a0and restarted it so Adani could win, according to Reuters. The state and Adani deny any wrongdoing, but that hasn\u2019t stopped many residents from viewing Adani and his government ties with suspicion. Adani is a vocal champion of Prime Minister Modi, and opposition leaders have ferociously questioned their relationship \u2014 with some even claiming that they were punished for pursuing the issue. The DRPPL spokesperson said Adani had won the project \u201cthrough an open, transparent, fair, and competitive bidding process,\u201d and said claims of any political relationships were \u201cbaseless and aimed at spreading misinformation.\u201d Meanwhile, some are simply tired of listening to the same old promises. \u201cI have grown\u00a0from a child to a woman (in Dharavi) and the development saga just keeps going on,\u201d said Reshma Prasant Bobde, a 42-year-old housewife whose family has lived there for generations. She described seeing the same cycle of politicians pushing redevelopment for \u201ctheir own agenda,\u201d followed by residents protesting and, ultimately, stagnation. \u201cThis talk of development\u00a0has been going on since my grandmother\u2019s time, but it hasn\u2019t moved an inch,\u201d she said. \u201cMy children, who are 11 and seven years old, will grow old and nothing will change in\u00a0Dharavi.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/29/business/india-adani-slum-redevelopment-concerns-intl-hnk-dst/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/01/2024", "section": "business"}}

According to CEO and founder Rob Sims, digital humans can help bridge the gap between AI technology and people. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve found is when people start working with and conversing with a digital human, they very quickly suspend disbelief,\u201d Sims tells CNN. \u201cIt becomes natural.\u201d AI explosion Since OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT was launched in November 2022, considerable hype has surrounded the potential of generative AI \u2014 artificial intelligence powered by huge datasets of information, capable of generating text outputs in a conversational way. Record levels of investment into generative AI have followed, with over $21 billion poured into the industry during the first nine months of last year, according to data insights company Pitchbook. In March 2023, Google launched Bard (recently renamed Gemini) and around the same time Anthropic released its AI assistant Claude. As generative AI chatbots become increasingly ubiquitous, Sum Vivas is one of several companies looking to make them more human. US and New Zealand-based UneeQ has developed animated conversational \u201cdigital humans\u201d that can be used as virtual sales reps and customer service agents on company websites, and this month it debuted Sama 2.0, an animated cabin crew member that answers questions on Qatar Airways\u2019 website and app. Microsoft recently announced that users of its Azure software would be able to create lifelike avatars capable of turning text prompts into animated speech.

{"id": "2022_04_27_business_diamonds-manmade-demand", "text": "It\u2019s proposal season, and engagements are on the rise. So are factory-made diamond sales. Not that you\u2019d know the difference. Man-made diamonds look the same as naturally occurring ones. The only noticeable difference is the price tag. \u201cThe result is really stunning,\u201d said Edahn Golan, an independent diamond industry analyst. He said March data showed the number of engagement rings sold that featured a manufactured diamond jumped 63% compared to last year, while the number of engagement rings sold with a natural diamond declined 25% in the same period. Going back by another month, to February, the data showed the number of rings sold with lab diamonds that month surged even more, to 80% compared to a year earlier while the number fell by 13% for natural diamond engagement rings.  \u201cThe big fear in the natural diamonds industry is that consumers will start accepting lab-grown diamonds in engagement rings,\u201d he said. Too late. \u201cIt\u2019s actually happening.\u201d  Tide is shifting Why are consumers flocking to man-made diamonds? Cost is the most obvious reason. The average retail price of the most popular one carat round man-made diamond for an engagement ring in March was $2,318, Golan said. \u201cThis is substantially less \u2013 as much as 73% cheaper \u2013 than a natural diamond of the same size, cut and clarity as the man-made diamond, which would cost $8,740,\u201d he said. Plus, the lower cost allows couples to buy a bigger stone.  \u201cA lab diamond is a real diamond, but maybe it took a few weeks to make it,\u201d said Golan. \u201cNatural diamonds were formed over 800 million to three billion years and there isn\u2019t an infinite supply of them.\u201d  This makes natural diamonds quite a bit more expensive, and prices are likely to rise as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has tightened the supply chain for natural raw diamonds. The sanctions directly target Alrosa, partly owned by the Russian government, which the US government identified as the world\u2019s largest diamond mining company, accounting for 28% of global diamond output. Man-made diamonds are also becoming popular as consumers are more aware and educated about them, said Dan Moran, a third-generation diamond expert and owner of LA-based fine jeweler Concierge Diamonds. Moran said the typical buyer of man-made diamonds is typically younger than 40 and very budget conscious. Mined diamonds have a controversial history that\u2019s tied to the use of child labor in some African diamond mines as well as sales of illegally-traded \u201cconflict diamonds\u201d that fund conflict in war-torn areas. Among Millennials and Gen Z, their eco-conscious mindset and ethical concerns about natural diamond sourcing is another factor influencing their preference for non-traditional engagement rings, according to a report from wedding planning website The Knot. Small but growing share of the diamond market Although its slice is growing, the market share for man-made diamonds remains relatively small. Currently, about 7% of the specialty diamond jewelry market is represented by man-made diamonds, up from 3% in 2020, said Golan.  Some major jewelry retailers are driving the effort to take man-made diamonds mainstream. In 2021, the world\u2019s largest jewelry company, Pandora\n            \n                (PANDY), made a major shift by announcing it would stop using mined diamonds and would swap to lab-created diamonds in its jewelry.  Pandora said it\u2019s instituting the change as part of an effort to sell sustainable jewelry, and also because consumers increasingly are asking for it. Signet,\n            \n                (SIG) the largest jewelry company in the United States (which owns Zales, Kay Jewelers and Jared chains) called out the popularity of lab diamond jewelry in its March earnings call with analysts. Calling it a \u201cfast-growing category\u201d in its jewelry portfolio, Signet CEO Virginia Drosos told analysts that lab-created diamonds are among the big jewelry trends she expects this year.  The company said it has expanded its man-made bridal jewelry selection in both its Zales and Kay Jewelers stores in response to the increased demand.  Fine jewelry brand Charles and Colvard, which makes lab-created diamonds, said consumers don\u2019t just want to look good with the jewelry they are wearing, they also want to feel good about it. \u201cAs the momentum for conscious consumerism grows, the surge towards lab grown diamonds isn\u2019t surprising,\u201d said Don O\u2019Connell, president and CEO of Charles & Colvard. \u201c[Consumers] want to know the origins of their stones and be reassured they\u2019re conflict-free. They\u2019re embracing the choice to purchase a piece of fine jewelry that aligns with their values.\u201d Lab-grown diamond brand VRAI said the pandemic, too, has sparked attention and action toward social and environmental issues. It said consumers are being more thoughtful and reassessing their purchasing habits, as well as the companies and industries they are supporting. There is, however, one important consideration for anyone buying lab-created diamonds: Man-made diamonds have little resale value.  So while you may not be able to tell a natural diamond from a factory made variety, someone with a trained eye can, said Golan. Once a stone is identified as a factory diamond, even though you paid a lot less for it, you also won\u2019t get much for it.  But the value of a ring isn\u2019t just monetary. \u201cAs a professional in the industry, I am asked all the time by people about what I think about a ring they have,\u201d said Moran, of Concierge Jewelers. \u201cI always say, if you love it, be happy with it. An engagement ring is a symbol of commitment and enduring love.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/27/business/diamonds-manmade-demand/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/01/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl", "text": "Sam Altman has agreed to return to lead OpenAI, the company said in a Tuesday post on X, just days after his surprise ouster as chief executive sparked an employee revolt that threatened to undermine what has been the leading company in the fledgling artificial intelligence industry. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman wrote that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft, which is the ChatGPT maker\u2019s biggest financial backer. The announcement appears to bring to an end days of chaos for the AI industry that included negotiations over who should lead OpenAI and how the firm should be run, as well as broader discussions about just how fast the arms race to develop AI technology should be moving. The details of Altman\u2019s firing and re-hiring remain murky. In its announcement Friday, OpenAI claimed that Altman had been insufficiently \u201ccandid\u201d with the board. That ambiguous language sent the rumor mill flying. But a key factor in Altman\u2019s ouster was the presence of\u00a0tensions between Altman, who favored pushing AI development more aggressively, and members of the original OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the crisis. As of Monday morning, Nadella had announced that Altman, along with fellow OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, would be joining Microsoft to lead a new AI research division. OpenAI said it had hired former Twitch chief Emmett Shear as interim CEO. But then hundreds of OpenAI employees, nearly the company\u2019s entire staff, threatened to leave, potentially for Microsoft, if the company\u2019s board didn\u2019t resign and reinstate Altman as CEO. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it invested billions in to help bolster its ambitions in developing AI, which many in Silicon Valley think will be the most important wave of technological advancement in the coming decades. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Microsoft CEO\u00a0Satya Nadella said on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d Altman\u2019s vision to quickly roll out and commercialize AI tools also appears to have won out. Publicly, Altman has long cautioned about risks posed by AI, and he\u202fhas pledged to lawmakers and customers that he would move OpenAI forward responsibly. \u201cIs [AI] gonna be like the printing press that diffused knowledge, power and learning widely across the landscape that empowered ordinary, everyday individuals that led to greater flourishing, that led above all to greater liberty?\u201d he said in a May Senate subcommittee hearing pressing for regulation. \u201cOr is it gonna be more like the atom bomb \u2014 huge technological breakthrough, but the consequences (severe, terrible) continue to haunt us to this day?\u201d But inside the company, Altman had been pushing to bring products to market more quickly and to sell them for a profit. Altman announced a few weeks ago at OpenAI\u2019s first-ever developer day that the company would make tools available so anyone could create their own version of ChatGPT. OpenAI has also worked with Microsoft to roll out ChatGPT-like technology across Microsoft\u2019s products. OpenAI and iPhone designer Jony Ive had also reportedly\u202fbeen in talks to raise $1 billion from Japanese conglomerate SoftBank for an AI device to replace the smartphone. \u2014 CNN\u2019s Juliana Liu and Diksha Madhok contributed reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/01/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_20_success_interest-rates-savings-cash", "text": "The Federal Reserve\u2019s benchmark interest rate remains at a 23-year high. That\u2019s thanks to the central bank\u2019s decision Wednesday to once again hold it steady, as it has done at the policy-making committee\u2019s past five meetings. That decision may be disappointing to some investors, homebuyers and those with a lot of credit card debt, since movement in the Fed\u2019s overnight lending rate influences rates \u2014 directly or indirectly \u2014 on consumer financial products (e.g., credit cards, bank loans and mortgages). But\u00a0with the Fed signaling that no rate cuts are likely until summer, it also means anyone with savings still has at least a few more months to make hay of their stash. That\u2019s because you can still get inflation-beating interest rates that will grow any money you have set aside for emergencies, vacations, down payments or any other goal in your sights over the next several years. However, that won\u2019t happen if you just let it sit in a traditional checking or savings account that yields next to nothing. There are more lucrative, low-risk options out there, with rates that are still at or near their peaks. \u201cBut perhaps not for much longer,\u201d said Ted Rossman, senior analyst at Bankrate. \u201cIf one of those fits into your financial plans, it\u2019s best to act soon.\u201d So, consider the following options when deciding where to park your hard-earned savings. High-yield online savings accounts The average annual percentage yield on bank savings accounts was just 0.52% as of March 13, according to Bankrate. That average is kept low by the biggest brick-and-mortar banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, which still are offering a paltry 0.01%. By contrast, there are still FDIC-insured online banks offering inflation-beating rates of between 4.35% and 5.35% on their high-yield savings accounts. Generally speaking, these are the best vehicles in which to keep your emergency funds for quick, easy access. Choosing between an account that pays 0.52% and one that pays 5.35% can mean forfeiting hundreds of dollars in interest. \u201cIf you put $10,000 in a savings account, that\u2019s a difference of $496 in interest earnings over the course of the year, assuming monthly compounding,\u201d Rossman said. While the rates on high-yield savings accounts have gone down a bit in recent months, \u201cwidespread cuts in online savings account rates are unlikely until the first Fed rate cut is near,\u201d said Ken Tumin, founder of DepositAccounts.com. As with any bank savings rate, high-yield savings account\u00a0rates\u00a0can change overnight, and the bank may not alert you when it lowers it. So make sure to check your monthly statement. Certificates of deposits Another high-return, low-risk investment that is great for money you likely won\u2019t need to tap for a few months or even a couple of years is a certificate of deposit. You can get the best returns on CDs through a brokerage such as Schwab, E*Trade or Fidelity. That\u2019s because you can comparison shop for CDs from any number of FDIC-insured banks and will not have to set up individual accounts with each institution. As of March 13, the average rate on a one-year CD was 1.95%, but some banks are offering as much are 5.4%. If you can get a one-year CD at, say, 5.4%, you will make $540 on a $10,000 investment. To get the greatest benefit from a CD, you have to leave the money invested for a fixed period. You can always access your principal sooner if you need to, but there may be early withdrawal penalties. As of March 20, CDs listed on Schwab.com with durations from three months up to three years were all yielding between 5.2% and 5.51%. CD rates on durations between four and 10 years ranged from 4.40% to 5.15%. Say you invest $10,000 in a one-year CD with a 5.36%\u00a0APY. At the end of that period, you\u2019d get your principal back plus $536 in interest when the CD matures, according to Bankrate\u2019s CD calculator. If you chose a two-year CD at 5.25%, you\u2019d bank an extra $1,078, assuming compounding interest. The same investment in a five-year CD at 5.15% would earn $2,854. \u201cIt makes sense to go long with CDs. To hedge your bets, include terms from one to five years. Starting a CD ladder will provide this mix,\u201d Tumin said. If you don\u2019t go through a brokerage you may get a reasonable deal from your primary bank, Tumin said. For example, he noted, Wells Fargo is still offering up to 5.01% on both 4-month and 7-month CDs. Or, at Bank of America, you can get up to 4.75% on a 7-month CD. But Tumin cautions that with any big bank CD you should take your money out at the end of the term, otherwise your bank may automatically renew it and lock you in to a much lower-yielding CD. Money market accounts and funds If you don\u2019t want to set up an online savings account at another bank, your own bank may offer you a money market deposit account that pays a higher yield than your regular checking or savings accounts. Money market accounts may have higher minimum deposit requirements than a regular savings account, but they are more liquid than a fixed-term certificate of deposit or Treasury bill, meaning they give you access to your money more quickly while still potentially giving you some of the highest yields available, said Doug Ornstein, senior manager for integrated solutions at TIAA Wealth Management. But don\u2019t confuse money market accounts with money market mutual funds, which invest in short-term, low-risk debt instruments. As of March 19, they had an average 7-day yield of 5.14%, according to the Crane Money Fund Index, which tracks the top 100 taxable money market funds. Unlike money market deposit accounts, money market mutual funds are not insured by the FDIC. But if you invest in a money market fund through a brokerage, your overall account is likely to be insured through the Securities Investor Protection Corp, which offers protection in the event your brokerage ever goes under. Treasury bills and notes Another option for money you can leave untouched anywhere from several months to a few years is to buy short-term Treasury bills and medium-term notes, which are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. Three- and six-month bills had yields of 5.39% and 5.33%\u00a0respectively on March 20 before the Fed\u2019s meeting ended, while nine-month and one-year bills were offering 5.19% and 5.08%\u00a0respectively, according to rates posted on Schwab.com for a $25,000 investment. Rates on Treasury notes with durations from two years to 10 years ranged between 4.29% and 4.72%. If you\u2019re someone who manages your portfolio like a hawk, you may feel comfortable buying T-bills on your own from TreasuryDirect.gov. But if you don\u2019t, it might be easier just to buy new issues through your brokerage account or invest in a short-term bond index fund or ETF, said Andy Smith, executive director of financial planning at Edelman Financial Engines. And if you\u2019re looking at money that will be needed in three to five years, you might consider a diversified fund of highly rated government and corporate bonds, Ornstein said. An 18-month AAA-rated corporate bond, for instance, was yielding 4.82% this week, while the three-year was at 4.49%. Meanwhile, three-year AAA-rated municipal bonds (which are issued by local governments) had a rate of 3.98%, according to Schwab.com. Don\u2019t chase yield When deciding on the best accounts and investments for your specific goals and peace of mind, it may pay to consult a fee-only fiduciary adviser \u2014 meaning, someone who doesn\u2019t get paid a commission to sell you a particular investment. What you\u2019ll always want to do is build in flexibility for yourself so you can easily access cash, regardless of your timeline for key goals. \u201cWhat happens if something changes and you need that down payment a lot sooner \u2014 or your parents need medical care fast?\u201d Smith said. That means balancing your desire for great yield with a need and desire for ease of access without penalty. Translation: Don\u2019t chase yield for yield\u2019s sake. Think of it this way, Ornstein said: Unless you have huge sums to invest or are an institutional investor, the difference between getting a 5.1% yield versus 5% is negligible, and in fact it could even cost you more if there are penalties for taking your money out early. \u201cMost of the time convenience is really important.

Controllers and pilots warned the crew of\u00a0Southwest\u00a04805 several times that the runway was closed, the recordings made by LiveATC.net show.\u00a0The incident is now under investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board and Federal Aviation Administration, and\u00a0Southwest\u00a0says it is engaged with both regulators. For the last several months the runway has been closed overnight for a taxiway construction project, and it reopens each morning at 5:45 a.m., according to the Portland International Jetport. A controller said on the recordings that the tower is also closed overnight. \u201cThere\u2019s an airport vehicle,\u201d one voice warned over the radio. Said another:\u00a0 \u201cThe\u00a0Southwest\u00a0pulling on to 29, just so you know there is a vehicle on the runway and it is still closed.\u201d But the\u00a0Southwest\u00a0pilots apparently never heard the warnings.\u00a0 They were recorded communicating on a different radio frequency with regional air traffic controllers near Boston. The Boston controller later told\u00a0Southwest\u00a0they departed three minutes before the runway reopened. Boston controller:\u00a0\u201cThat runway was closed.\u201d Southwest\u00a0pilot:\u00a0\u201cI thought it opened at :45.\u00a0 There was no markings or anywhere.\u201d Controller:\u00a0\u201cIt did open at :45, but you departed at :42.\u201d Pilot:\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s not what we\u2019re showing, but ok.\u201d The FAA told CNN the runway was indeed closed at the time, and that the \u201cairport vehicle exited the runway before the plane began its takeoff roll.\u201d It is unclear how close the plane came to colliding with the runway crew.\u00a0 The tower controller told the workers over the radio that he knew \u201cyou were on the runway and had to exit\u201d because of the takeoff.

{"id": "2024_06_28_media_msnbc-biden-trump-debate", "text": "On MSNBC, the mood Thursday night was somber. \u201cI am not going to put a fine sheen on it, or a spin on it, even though I am in the spin room,\u201d MSNBC anchor Alex Wagner said from the\u00a0CNN presidential debate\u00a0spin room in\u00a0Atlanta. \u201cThere\u00a0has\u00a0been a uniformly negative reaction to Biden\u2019s performance tonight.\u201d Wagner was speaking about the reaction from Democratic sources, but on the cable news channel\u00a0that\u2019s seen as the\u00a0home to America\u2019s progressive political wing, the mood\u00a0on set\u00a0was stark. \u201cThis was about revealing who Donald Trump was, but it was also Joe Biden battling a caricature of himself as an enfeebled person,\u201d Wagner said of the debate. \u201cAnd he did nothing to disabuse, I think, the country of the notion that he is very old and was lost frequently in that debate.\u201d While the\u00a0Democratic party\u00a0immediately\u00a0declared victory\u00a0following\u00a0President Joe Biden\u2019s\u00a0debate with former President Donald Trump, Biden\u2019s poor performance on the CNN stage, in which the 81-year-old spoke in a hoarse and at-times unintelligible voice as Trump unleashed a flurry of lies, set off alarm bells on the left. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a DEFCON 1 moment,\u201d David Plouffe, former President Barack Obama\u2019s campaign manager, told MSNBC star Rachel Maddow following the debate. \u201cIt really pains me to say this \u2014 they are about three years apart, they seemed like 30 years apart tonight.\u201d The mood on MSNBC reflected the mood in progressive and Democratic political circles: panic and alarm. The concerns didn\u2019t end there. MSNBC host Joy Reid told viewers she was receiving messages from Democratic sources expressing anxiety about the president\u2019s performance, prompting\u00a0an open discussion of a once-unspoken idea: replacing Biden as the party\u2019s nominee. \u201cThe universal reaction was somewhere approaching panic. The people who were texting with me were very concerned about President Biden seeming extremely feeble, seeming extremely weak,\u201d Reid said. \u201cI think conversations range from whether he should be in this race tomorrow morning to what was wrong with him,\u201d anchor Nicolle Wallace said.\u00a0\u201cThere were people talking about how that process works, and that conversation is live and active at the highest levels of the Democratic party.\u201d \u201cSomeone actually sent me the rules,\u201d Reid said, referring to the Democratic Party\u2019s nomination rules. \u201cThe rules are circulating!\u201d Wallace replied. The anxieties relayed on the progressive outlet Thursday night came in sharp contrast to right-wing media\u2019s reaction to Trump\u2019s history of scandals and lies. During and after Trump\u2019s time in the White House, prominent figures on Fox News and other right-wing outlets vigorously defended the Republican in the face of two impeachments, the January 6 attack, a felony conviction and the reality that he lost the 2020 election. And while\u00a0MSNBC\u2019s hosts pointed to the flood of lies from Trump during Thursday night\u2019s debate, the conversation continually returned to Biden\u2019s performance. \u201cThe president is an avatar for the American people,\u201d\u00a0Reid said, offering support for Biden\u2019s record as president. \u201cBut you cannot become president again when America looks at you and that avatar to them looks broken.\u201d \u201cThe job of the president is making decisions. The job of a presidential candidate is to communicate. It just is. That is the job,\u201d MSNBC anchor Chris Hayes later added. \u201cI think Joe Biden has a very good record on making decisions. And I think he is a very poor communicator right now.\u201d Outside the MSNBC studio, other prominent liberal voices suggested Biden should step aside following the debate. \u201cPresident Biden is a good man who capped a long career in public service with a successful presidential term. But I hope he reviews his debate performance Thursday evening and withdraws from the race, throwing the choice of a Democratic nominee to the convention in August,\u201d\u00a0New York Times columnist\u00a0Nicholas Kristof wrote. \u201cJoe Biden had his shot\u2014a chance to dispel concerns about his age and his abilities,\u201d\u00a0David Corn wrote\u00a0in Mother Jones, the progressive website and print magazine. \u201cBut in his first debate with Donald Trump, he stumbled through 90 minutes, muffing answers, often looking uncertain, speaking in a low, gravelly voice that did not convey strength. This was not only a missed chance. It was a disaster.\u201d Mehdi Hasan, the Zeteo editor-in-chief and former MSNBC anchor, struck a similar chord. \u201cJoe Biden\u2019s got to go,\u201d\u00a0Hasan said. \u201cTonight was a car crash for the Biden presidency, for the Biden campaign. It was painful to watch at times, I\u2019m sorry, it felt like elder abuse.\u201d But while some were calling for Biden to step aside, others urged patience with the candidate as the campaign revved up to the November election. \u201cPredictably, Biden\u2019s poor performance led to some chatter about his\u00a0stepping down\u00a0and letting someone else be the nominee. This is not going to happen,\u201d\u00a0MSNBC host Symone Sanders, who advised then-candidate Biden ahead of the 2020 election,\u00a0wrote early Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s tight, but Biden still has time to make his case.\u00a0After all, presidential campaigns are about fighting all the way until the end.\u201d Debate reaction at Fox On Fox News, Trump booster Sean Hannity seemed to relish in what he called a \u201ctrain wreck\u201d although he claimed \u201cI wish it weren\u2019t so.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s over, it\u2019s done,\u201d Hannity said in the minutes after the debate wrapped. \u201cIt was almost like I was waiting at times for someone to throw in the towel. It was a \u2018no mas, no mas\u2019 moment,\u201d Hannity said. Hannity said Trump, on the other hand, \u201cwas dialed in,\u201d without mentioning the dozens of falsehoods from Trump on stage. \u201cHe stayed on message and was extraordinarily effective on pretty much every issue of substance they talked about,\u201d Hannity said. Fox host Jesse Watters joked that \u201cJoe did a great job,\u201d to chuckles from the Fox News panel. \u201cAnd I think Democrats should absolutely keep him as the nominee and run him against Donald Trump and everything will be fine,\u201d he said sarcastically, a slight smirk across his face. Watters then said he felt something he had never felt before \u2014 he felt bad for the president. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I could feel empathy for Joe Biden but that\u2019s how bad it was,\u201d he said, before going on and falsely claiming the White House had \u201chidden\u201d Biden for four years.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/28/media/msnbc-biden-trump-debate/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/01/2024", "section": "business"}}

Shares of the tech behemoth rose 2.1% to an all-time high close of $377.44 on Monday, beating the previous record of $376.17. That comes after shares of Microsoft fell 1.7% on Friday, when Sam Altman was ousted from his position at OpenAI in a boardroom coup.

The Recording Industry Association of America \u2013 the trade group on behalf of labels including Sony Music Entertainment, UMG Recordings and Warner Records \u2013 filed two copyright infringement cases against AI companies Suno and Uncharted Labs, the developer behind Udio, for training their AI models with the labels\u2019 unlicensed sound recordings. Udio is the company behind \u201cBBL Drizzy,\u201d the AI-generated song that went viral last month during the Kendrick Lamar and Drake spat. Udio was founded last year by former Google DeepMind researchers to make it \u201ceasy for anyone to create emotionally resonant music in an instant,\u201d according to the company. In April, it raised $10 million in funding. Meanwhile, Suno raised $125 million in funding last month. The platform, which allows users to create songs with only a few prompts, relies on OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT for lyrics and title development. Udio and Suno did not immediately respond to a request for comment. RIAA CEO Mitch Glazier said in a statement that the lawsuits are \u201cnecessary to reinforce the most basic rules of the road for the responsible, ethical, and lawful development of generative AI systems and to bring Suno\u2019s and Udio\u2019s blatant infringement to an end.\u201d He added that the music community is already partnering and collaborating with \u201cresponsible developers to build sustainable AI tools\u201d that put artists and songwriters in charge, but unlicensed services can exploit an artist\u2019s work \u201cwithout consent or pay set back \u2026 .\u201d In April, more than 200 artists, including Billie Eilish, Kacey Musgraves, J Balvin, Ja Rule, Jon Bon Jovi, The Jonas Brothers, Katy Perry, Miranda Lambert and more, signed an open letter\u00a0organized by the non-profit Artist Rights Alliance calling on AI developers, technology companies, platforms and digital music services to \u201ccease the use of artificial intelligence to infringe upon and devalue the rights of human artists.\u201d The lawsuit against Udio states \u201cif developed with the permission and participation of copyright owners, generative AI tools will be able to assist humans in creating and producing new and innovative music.\u201d It added: \u201cBut if developed irresponsibly, without regard for fundamental copyright protections, those same tools threaten enduring and irreparable harm to recording artists, record labels, and the music industry, inevitably reducing the quality of new music available to consumers and diminishing our shared culture.\u201d Meanwhile, the lawsuit against Suno states the company has over 10,000,000 users generating music files using the platform, bringing in about 2,000,000 streams. \u201cThese digital music files have been released to the public\u2014some already finding their way onto the major streaming services\u2014and compete with the copyrighted sound recordings that enabled their creation; yet Suno sought no permission from and gives no credit or compensation to the human artists or other rightsholders whose works fueled their creation.\u201d This story has been updated with additional context and developments.

{"id": "2024_06_25_business_ford-recalling-550000-trucks", "text": "Ford is recalling more than 550,000 F-150 pickups in the United States because of an issue that can cause the transmission to suddenly and unexpectedly, at any speed, shift down to first gear. These trucks have six-speed transmissions. Usually, first gear is used to drive a vehicle at very low speeds, so suddenly shifting to first gear at high speed could cause the truck to slow rapidly or even cause the driver to lose control. The trucks involved are older models from the 2014 model year. The problem with these particular trucks first came to Ford\u2019s attention in February of this year, though, as the automaker received a number of reports of 2014 F-150s suddenly downshifting at the wrong time. Before that happens, a malfunction indicator light in the truck\u2019s gauge cluster may turn on Ford spokesperson Maria Buczkowski said in an email to CNN. In some cases, the problem may quickly rectify itself and the truck will continue driving normally. In other cases, the truck may need to be shut down and restarted before the transmission begins working normally again. In 2019, Ford recalled roughly 1.2 million model year 2011 through 2013 F-150s for the same issue. The problem results from a loss of signal between a speed sensor and a control module that operates the automatic transmission. To fix the problem, Ford dealers will update the trucks\u2019 control module software at no cost to the owner. Ford will start mailing letters to owners of the trucks involved in a few days. A new software update to fix the 2014 trucks will be ready sometime in the next three months, Buczkowski said. Customers with questions can call Ford customer service at 866-436-7332 and ask for information about recall number 24S37.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/business/ford-recalling-550000-trucks/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/01/2024", "section": "business"}}

Until the film\u2019s release on June 16, domestic sales had been lagging more than 25% behind 2023\u2019s performance, according to Comscore data. \u201cOver the past few weeks, we\u2019ve seen the year-to-date, year-over-year domestic box office revenue deficit shrink from 27% to 19% and that\u2019s due in large part to the amazing and much welcome performance of \u2018Inside Out 2,\u2019 a film that has adjusted the mood of the movie industry in just a few short weeks,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore. The movie is the highest grossing film of the year, and the first to pass $1 billion since \u201cBarbie,\u201d which came out last July. It also joins the ranks of eight other Disney and Pixar movies grossing more than a $1 billion, including \u201cThe Incredibles 2,\u201d \u201cFinding Dory,\u201d both \u201cFrozen\u201d movies and the final two \u201cToy Story\u201d installments. Daniel Loria, editorial director at Box Office Pro, which collects sales and showtime\u00a0data from thousands of movie theaters across the United States, projects this year will see an overall domestic box office total between $8.1 billion and $8.4 billion, down from 2023\u2019s total of more than $9 billion, the highest since the pandemic. But Loria notes it is still possible to close the gap further. \u201cThe impact of the strike on the box office is clear in the first five months of the year, but June has shown us the crucial role movie theaters play in a film industry firing on all cylinders,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cIf the movies are there, the audience will follow. I expect to see great numbers in the second half of the year, leading into 2025 and beyond.

{"id": "2024_06_26_business_cdk-outage-economic-impact", "text": "If you aren\u2019t in the market for a car or your family\u2019s income isn\u2019t tied to a car dealership, you might not be aware of crippling cyber attacks that have left nearly 15,000 dealerships across North America struggling to provide services to customers. Or if you are aware of it, you might think, \u201cWell that sucks, but good thing I won\u2019t be hurt by it.\u201d Not so fast. What\u2019s happening: CDK Global, a data provider whose software is used by car dealerships to handle everything from records to scheduling, was hit by cyber attacks on June 19 that caused the company to shut down most of its systems. Not every dealer uses CDK\u2019s products, and even those that do may not use them for everything, but the system shutdown has been a problem for many. To protect customer privacy, customers\u2019 details typically aren\u2019t written out on a piece of paper that\u2019s just sitting on a desk anymore, my colleagues Ramishah Maruf and Peter Valdes-Dapena report. But with the outage approaching the one-week mark, some dealerships are reverting to old-fashioned methods to avoid missing out on sales during what tends to be one of the busiest times of the year for car shopping. Still, they haven\u2019t been able to access information about deals and customer appointments that were stored within CDK\u2019s servers. And on Tuesday, CDK informed customers it doesn\u2019t expect its systems to be back up and running before June 30. Working its way through the economy Just like the strikes that upended many parts of the economy last summer, the longer the CDK outage goes on, the greater the impact it will have on the US economy. Yes, you read that right. The CDK incident isn\u2019t an isolated event implicating only dealers and buyers. Last month there were $122 billion of transactions at car dealerships, according to Commerce Department estimates. That accounts for 17% of all retail sales in May. An outage lasting through June 30 would mean 10 days without dealership access to CDK. If sales slide even just 10% at the average dealership as a result, total auto retail sales could dip by around $4 billion for the month, according to estimates by Russell Price, chief economist at Ameriprise Financial, based on last month\u2019s retail sales report. But in his view, the average dealership will probably experience a more drastic drop, closer to 40% for each day the outage drags on. If it ends up lasting 10 days, he estimates they\u2019ll lose $16 billion in sales. That, he estimates, would depress total retail sales by 2.3%. Now here\u2019s where it gets even more glaring: Retail sales aren\u2019t just some minor part of the economy. They account for about a third of all consumer spending. And consumer spending is responsible for more than two-thirds of US gross domestic product. So in effect, retail sales are the backbone to the backbone of the economy. By Price\u2019s estimates, a 2.3% decline in retail sales for June would shave nearly a percentage point off the annualized GDP growth rate the second quarter of this year. \u201cThe good news is what we lose in retail sales in June we should make up in July and third-quarter GDP, assuming all systems are back online,\u201d Price told CNN. To add insult to injury Now, again, you might be saying to yourself, \u201cOh I see what\u2019s going on here it\u2019s just a temporary dip that\u2019ll self-correct when everything is working properly again. That doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m actually going to be hurt.\u201d If only it were so simple\u2026 Investors care a lot about GDP data. It\u2019s like a quarterly check-up on the health of the economy. So it doesn\u2019t tend to sit well with them if it becomes apparent that the economy may be less healthy than anticipated. That\u2019s why there was an ugly stock market selloff in April when the government reported that fourth-quarter GDP fell by much more than economists were expecting. Consider yourself warned: You may want to hold off on looking at your 401(k) on July 25, when the government releases second-quarter GDP estimates.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/business/cdk-outage-economic-impact/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/01/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_01_tech_aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl", "text": "A London-based technology company is looking to \u201cdemocratize\u201d talent-identification and scouting in soccer using a mobile app. Free to download and available globally, the aiScout app allows aspiring soccer stars to enter virtual trials for professional clubs by uploading self-recorded footage of themselves completing a series of drills. It offers 75 exercises, designed to test a range of skills, with videos showing users how to complete them. Performances are automatically scored by artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The data can then be accessed by clubs, allowing their scouts to peruse scores for viable talent, honing their search with a variety of filters; from age and gender to position on the pitch. The app currently has two English Premier League (EPL) partners, Chelsea and Burnley, and clubs can tailor their in-app trials to meet specific needs and set their own benchmarks by having their academy players complete the same drills. \u201cWe\u2019re putting that data up front to make better use of [the scouts\u2019] time,\u201d said Richard Felton-Thomas, chief operating officer of ai.io, the company behind the app. \u201cTo say [to scouts], \u2018Go over to this place today because there\u2019s three players in that game that are all actually beating your Chelsea standard\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s going to be the best use of your time.\u2019\u201d It already appears to be working for some. Ben Greenwood had never had a trial with a professional club until he downloaded the app in 2019. After uploading footage of himself, the 17-year-old landed a trial with Chelsea, becoming the first user of the app to get a trial with a pro club. He signed a contract\u00a0with EPL team Bournemouth\u00a0in 2021. \u2018It\u2019s more about evolution\u2019 Having beta-tested in with players spanning 125 countries, Greenwood among them, 135 players have been trialed or signed by pro clubs or national teams through the app \u2014 which fully launched in September 2023 \u2014 according to Felton-Thomas. Just over 100,000 players make up the current database, but with over 100 clubs lined up to join Chelsea and Burnley, as well as a multi-year partnership with Major League Soccer in the US announced last May, Felton-Thomas projects user numbers to surge into the millions as the operation ramps up this year. Felton-Thomas said the \u201clion\u2019s share\u201d of its income comes from charging clubs a license fee to run the platform. Annual fees vary depending on the size of the club and the tools they require, ranging from six figures for \u201ctier one\u201d sides like Chelsea, to thousands of pounds for clubs lower down the footballing pyramid. The use of smart technology in sport continues to expand, including\u00a0AI commentary tools and wearable tech for elite athletes. The global market for sports analytics, valued at\u00a0$2.7 billion\u00a0in 2023, is projected to grow 22% by the end of the decade, according to market research firm Grand View Research. Should soccer talent scouts be concerned about being edged out by the arrival of AI in their industry? For Felton-Thomas, new technologies can co-exist with traditional methods. \u201cIt\u2019s more about evolution than revolution,\u201d Felton-Thomas explained. \u201cWe can\u2019t tell you when that player\u2019s actually in that match, how does he deal with adversity? What happens when he\u2019s 2-0 down? What happens when someone\u2019s shouting at him? What happens when he\u2019s just made a massive mistake?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got the ability to just augment real people to do their jobs better and faster, which then gives an opportunity to the player through the AI, but you\u2019re still actually just connecting them to the human on the other side, which is the club and the scout.\u201d While football remains ai.io\u2019s primary focus, the company is looking into opportunities in other sports to launch in the coming years. Further ahead, it may branch out beyond sports. \u201cYou think about the notion that you can be at home and analyze your movements, and how this could spin into health care, physical assessments for military disciplines and emergency services,\u201d Felton-Thomas told CNN.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/01/tech/aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/01/2024", "section": "business"}}

The probe is yet another complication for the social media platform, which is already facing the threat of a potential US ban or a forced divestment from its Chinese parent company. The sources said that the FTC is probing TikTok over an alleged violation of the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection rule, which requires companies to notify parents and obtain consent before collecting data from children under 13. The agency is also investigating whether TikTok violated a portion of the FTC Act that prohibits \u201cunfair or deceptive\u201d business practices, the sources said, in denying that TikTok user data could be accessed by individuals in China. The FTC could bring a suit against TikTok or settle with the company in the coming weeks, according to one of the sources. Politico reported news of the probe earlier. When asked about the investigation, FTC Director of Public Affairs Douglas Farrar replied: \u201cNo comment.\u201d TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The FTC probe comes as TikTok faces an existential threat in the US. Earlier this month, a bipartisan group in the US House of Representatives voted to pass a law forcing TikTok to be sold by ByteDance or face a ban from US app stores. The bill is now before the Senate, and President Joe Biden has said he would sign it if it gets to his desk. Senate leaders, however, have indicated they are taking a deliberate approach \u2014\u00a0which could lead to delays or even potentially doom the House bill. The short-form video company, owned by Chinese firm ByteDance, has denied assertions that its app poses a national security threat to US citizens. TikTok, which does not operate in China, has said that the Chinese government has never accessed US user data. Cybersecurity experts say Chinese laws require ByteDance to cooperate with that country\u2019s intelligence demands\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a fact that, given ByteDance\u2019s ownership of TikTok, could hypothetically put US user data at risk. To address that issue, TikTok has taken steps to store its US user data on cloud servers controlled by US tech giant Oracle and established internal protocols limiting access by non-US employees. TikTok acknowledged to Congress in 2022 that employees based in China could access US user data, following a report that year by BuzzFeed News that ByteDance employees had accessed that information on multiple occasions. TikTok CEO Shou Chew, in his first appearance before Congress last year, also acknowledged that several ByteDance employees were fired for spying on certain US journalists as part of a \u201cmisguided attempt\u201d to hunt down leakers within the company.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/ftc-tiktok-probe-privacy-and-security/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/01/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_media_nbc-news-ousts-ronna-mcdaniel", "text": "NBC News on Tuesday ousted former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel, just days after her hiring as a paid political analyst sparked intense backlash from the network\u2019s top television anchors over McDaniel\u2019s role in subverting the 2020 election and attacks on the press. \u201cThere is no doubt that the last several days have been difficult for the News Group,\u201d NBCUniversal News Group President Cesar Conde said in a memo to staff. \u201cAfter listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor.\u201d \u201cI want to personally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down,\u201d Conde continued. \u201cWhile this was a collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team, I approved it and take full responsibility for it.\u201d Ahead of the network\u2019s decision, McDaniel spent the day Tuesday interviewing attorneys in preparation for a potential legal battle with NBC, a person familiar with the matter told CNN. Creative Artists Agency, the talent agency that brokered McDaniel\u2019s deal with NBC, also parted ways with her, the person said. The reversal comes after journalists and anchors at both NBC and its cable news sibling MSNBC publicly denounced the decision to hire McDaniel as a paid analyst in a stunning and unprecedented on-air rebuke of network brass that has embarrassed the Peacock Network. McDaniel, who recently stepped down from the RNC under pressure from former President Donald Trump, was involved in attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. As head of the RNC, she was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d In the years since, McDaniel continued to claim that the election had \u201cproblems\u201d and that Biden did not legitimately win the election, fanning the flames of election denialism. NBC\u2019s announcement Friday that it had hired McDaniel was quickly met with alarm by the network\u2019s journalists. The revolt spilled into public view on Sunday when McDaniel appeared on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with moderator Kristen Welker in her first interview since she was hired by the network. Welker disclosed that the interview had been scheduled to take place prior to NBC announcing McDaniel would become a paid contributor for the network, stating that she had no involvement in her hiring. Following the interview, Chuck Todd, NBC News\u2019 chief political analyst, delivered a stinging on-air criticism of NBC executives for their decision to hire McDaniel, telling Welker, \u201cI think our bosses owe you an apology for putting you in this situation.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a reason a lot of journalists at NBC News are uncomfortable with this,\u201d Todd said, explaining that under McDaniel, the RNC engaged in \u201cgaslighting\u201d and \u201ccharacter assassination\u201d when dealing with the news media. The following day, MSNBC hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough joined Todd in protesting the decision on their program \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d \u201cTo be clear, we believe NBC News should seek out conservative Republican voices to provide balance in their election coverage, but it should be conservative Republicans, not a person who used her position of power to be an anti-democracy election denier,\u201d\u00a0Brzezinski said. \u201cWe hope NBC will reconsider its decision. It goes without saying that she will not be a guest on \u2018Morning Joe\u2019 in her capacity as a paid contributor.\u201d Nicolle Wallace, host of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cDeadline: White House,\u201d later joined in the rebuke, saying on her program that the network\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel was nothing short of a potential threat to democracy. \u201cNBC News is, either wittingly or unwittingly, teaching election deniers that what they can do stretches well beyond appearing on our air and interviews to peddle lies about the sanctity and integrity of our elections,\u201d Wallace told viewers. Rachel Maddow \u2014 the network\u2019s biggest star \u2014 later devoted the first half-hour of her prime-time program to the controversy, saying the decision to hire McDaniel was \u201cinexplicable.\u201d Maddow took issue with McDaniel\u2019s long track record of demonizing the news media, labeling the press as \u201cfake news,\u201d and launching ugly attacks on NBC News journalists and MSNBC hosts. \u201cWe do not take it personally when we get attacked, when they say they want to put us on trial and execute us for treason,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so I want to associate myself with all my colleagues at MSNBC and NBC News who have voiced loud and principled objections to our company for putting on the payroll someone who hasn\u2019t just attacked us as journalists, but someone who is part of an ongoing project to get rid of our system of government,\u201d she said of McDaniel. \u201cSomeone who is still trying to convince Americans that this election stuff doesn\u2019t really work. That this last election wasn\u2019t a real result. That American elections are fraudulent.\u201c The on-air revolt ensnared NBC\u2019s top leaders, including NBCUniversal News Group chair Cesar Conde, NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown, who were responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring. MSNBC president Rashida Jones also did not object to the decision, people familiar with the matter said. In the wake of Conde\u2019s announcement to sever ties with McDaniel, MSNBC host Joy Reid and Maddow addressed the reversal on the network\u2019s air, praising the move as \u201cbold\u201d and \u201cstrong.\u201d \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/media/nbc-news-ousts-ronna-mcdaniel/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/01/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_media_wall-street-journal-evan-gershkovich", "text": "Early Wednesday morning, at 2am ET, imprisoned\u00a0Wall Street Journal\u00a0reporter\u00a0Evan Gershkovich\u2019s\u00a0trial commenced before a Russian court on bogus espionage charges. Covering the judicial charade will present an unprecedented challenge for The Journal and other news outlets, given that the trial will take place in secret, behind closed doors. Some images of Gershkovich are expected to be distributed, but the flow of information will be tightly controlled by the\u00a0Vladimir Putin-led government, which will certainly work to splice together a narrative that supports its propaganda goals. Regardless of what information is made available by the court, there is one aspect of coverage that The Journal will be unmistakably clear about: Gershkovich is innocent, and the court proceedings amount to nothing but political theater. \u201cTo even call it a trial \u2026 is unfair to Evan and a continuation of this travesty of justice that already has gone on for far too long,\u201d\u00a0Emma Tucker, The Journal editor in chief,\u00a0bluntly stated Tuesday\u00a0in a letter to readers. Elena Cherney, who oversees the broadsheet\u2019s standards and ethics teams, stressed to me that it is imperative for The Journal \u2014\u00a0and other news organizations\u00a0\u2014 to make it abundantly clear that Gershkovich has been unjustly detained and that the proceedings are a \u201cviolation of human rights.\u201d \u201cThis isn\u2019t a trial as we normally think of trials,\u201d Cherney said by phone Tuesday. \u201cThis is a process that is completely lacking in due process. It is obviously a bogus allegation. And we need to make it clear in our coverage that we are not leaning into the process\u2026 because we know these are empty charges and these are political charges.\u201d Indeed, The Journal has been clear-eyed about the matter since Gershkovich was detained by Russian authorities 15 months ago while gathering reporting in the city of Yekaterinburg. When Gershkovich was indicted earlier this month, the outlet ran a\u00a0strong headline\u00a0that refused to entertain the notion that Gershkovich was working as a clandestine spy for the U.S. government. \u201cWSJ Reporter Evan Gershkovich, Falsely Accused of Espionage, Is Indicted in Russia,\u201d the headline read. Other news outlets, however, have at times been less direct about the matter. Cherney, who told me that she has been in touch with various newsrooms ahead of the trial to offer The Journal\u2019s point of view, said she believes news organizations should be clear with audiences about the circumstances. Buying into the judicial show put on by Russia, after all, is what Russia desires \u2014 and it would deliver the Kremlin a propaganda victory. \u201cThis coverage should not read or sound as if this is a legitimate process,\u201d Cherney said, imploring other newsrooms not to legitimize the proceedings or get trapped in bothsidesism while covering the story. And while the court hearings will be held behind closed doors, Cherney said she believes that news organizations should lean into that aspect of the case when covering it, calling it a \u201ccritical piece of the story.\u201d \u201cIt is a secret trial, if you can call it a trial, and that is symptomatic of a complete lack of due process,\u201d Cherney said. \u201cThis is not how people are charged with crimes in the United States or other Western countries. And we need to take pains to explain everything we know about the lack of legal protection that Evan has \u2014 the lack of information that we have about the process.\u201d No verdict is expected to be rendered on Wednesday. And it\u2019s unclear precisely how long it will take for a final decision to be made. It could take weeks or even months for a verdict to be handed down by the Russian court. But Cherney and her colleagues at The Journal are hoping that the U.S. government will succeed in freeing Gershkovich. In the meantime, she said, they\u2019re all living through a nightmare. \u201cIt is the most difficult, terrible situation that we have ever dealt with and ever hope to deal with,\u201d Cherney said, \u201cand we just hope to get him out.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/media/wall-street-journal-evan-gershkovich/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/01/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_28_business_boeing-ntsb-violation-absurdity", "text": "If you\u2019re a PR person, I can\u2019t possibly think of a harder job right now than working at Boeing. It\u2019s not just clean-up on aisle six, it\u2019s clean up the entire store, loading dock and parking lot on a daily \u2014 if not hourly \u2014 basis. And boy did Boeing have to bring out a lot of mops on Thursday. But this time, it kinda, sorta just maybe wasn\u2019t Boeing\u2019s fault. Let me explain. Boeing held a press conference from a factory in Renton, Washington, on Tuesday to talk about quality improvements. But Boeing surely knew that they\u2019d get asked about the door plug that blew off a 737 Max on an Alaska Airlines flight in January. So Elizabeth Lund, senior vice president of quality at Boeing, didn\u2019t bother beating around the bush. Lund kicked off the briefing by sharing why the four bolts needed to hold the door plug in place were never installed before the plane left the factory in October: paperwork. The workers who needed to reinstall the bolts never had the work order telling them the work needed to be done, my colleagues Gregory Wallace and Chris Isidore reported. \u201cThe fact that one employee could not fill out one piece of paperwork in this condition and could result in an accident was shocking to all of us,\u201d Lund said. The lack of paperwork was not new information. It was previously disclosed in testimony before the US Senate Commerce Committee by none other than the head of the National Transportation Safety Board, the government agency leading the investigation. But strangely enough, Boeing sharing that information itself got Boeing in trouble with the NTSB. The agency reprimanded Boeing Thursday, saying it had \u201cblatantly violated\u201d the agency\u2019s rules. The violation, per an NTSB statement, was sharing \u201cinvestigative information\u201d and giving \u201can analysis of factual information previously released.\u201d This would basically be like your friend making a public Instagram announcement saying she\u2019s pregnant, prompting you to post on your story saying something like, \u201cMy best friend is going to be a mom!\u201d And then the friend sends you an angry text demanding you take it down because it\u2019s private information and you aren\u2019t allowed to comment on it. \u201cAs a party to many NTSB investigations over the past decades, few entities know the rules better than Boeing,\u201d the NTSB said (yeah, government agencies throw shade too sometimes). But the NTSB is taking matters even further, saying it will no longer share any information generated by the NTSB during its investigation and that it would be referring Boeing\u2019s conduct to the Department of Justice, meaning there could be a potential criminal probe. The NTSB declined to provide any further comment to CNN. Clean up, clean up everybody everywhere When the NTSB\u2019s statement went out, Boeing\u2019s PR team went back into crisis clean-up mode. I admit it\u2019s hard to take anything they say at face value, and part of my job as a journalist is to be skeptical and question any claims PR people make. But I think there\u2019s an ounce (okay, maybe closer to a quarter ounce) of truth in Boeing\u2019s response to the NTSB. It said it held the briefing in an effort to \u201ctake responsibility\u201d and be transparent, adding that it \u201cshared context on the lessons we have learned from the January 5 accident.\u201d \u201cWe deeply regret that some of our comments, intended to make clear our responsibility in the accident and explain the actions we are taking, overstepped the NTSB\u2019s role as the source of investigative information,\u201d Boeing said Thursday. Without giving Boeing too much credit, at least some executives were trying to take a sliver of ownership. But apparently, that\u2019s an NTSB violation. At the same time, rules are rules no matter how hypocritical they are. Boeing probably should have treaded more carefully. When CNN reached out to Boeing, a spokesperson responded, \u201cWe defer to the NTSB for information regarding the investigation.\u201d The irony in all this is the NTSB\u2019s reaction is distracting from the more glaring story here: how a simple thing like a lack of paperwork may have endangered a plane full of people.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/28/business/boeing-ntsb-violation-absurdity/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/01/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_29_business_nathans-famous-competitive-eating-hot-dogs", "text": "Every Fourth of July, starting when she was 15, Jacqueline Lewis and her family come together to honor a great American tradition: the Nathan\u2019s Famous hot dog eating competition. \u201cI think people want to know how many hot dogs a human can eat in that amount of time.\u201d Lewis, now 26, told CNN on a warm June day while eating miniature corn dogs (at a leisurely pace) outside of the original Nathan\u2019s location in Coney Island. \u201cI think they want to know.\u201d Lewis and her family aren\u2019t the only ones who want to see how many franks competitors can scarf down in 10 minutes. Each year, close to two million people watch Nathan\u2019s hot dog eating contest on ESPN, according to the frankfurter brand. Tens of thousands of spectators come out to Brooklyn\u2019s Coney Island to watch the event in person. Competitors train for months in advance, preparing their bodies to consume thousands of calories in just a few minutes. When it was announced recently that reigning champion Joey Chestnut was barred from competing this year over his deal with Impossible Foods \u2013 a plant-based meat company \u2013 it made national headlines. Nathan\u2019s, and the marketing visionaries behind the annual event, helped shape competitive eating as we know it today: a bombastic, showy sport that some say symbolizes America\u2019s obsession with excess. But eating contests date back. Way back. Two men, many ginger cakes It seems like people have always had a fascination with how much someone can eat and how quickly. \u201cSpeed and volume competitions pop up in Greek myth, in the Eddas of Norse myth, and even in what may be mankind\u2019s first novel, Apuleius\u2019 \u2018Golden Ass,\u2019 written in the second century A.D.,\u201d wrote Jason Fagone in his book \u201cHorsemen of the Esophagus: Competitive Eating and the Big Fat American Dream.\u201d In the United States, the tradition goes back a few hundred years. Fagone cites a 1793 Pennsylvania newspaper that described an event in which two men \u201cundertook to eat twenty-four ginger cakes each.\u201d Over time, pie eating contests became a regular part of Fourth of July celebrations as well as \u201ca natural icebreaker for picnics, summer camps, and county fairs,\u201d Fagone wrote. In the 19th century, there were basically two kinds of contests, explained Adrienne Bitar, a lecturer in American studies at Cornell University and the author of \u201cDiet and the Disease of Civilization.\u201d There was speed eating \u2014\u00a0who could eat the most in a set amount of time \u2014\u00a0and untimed competitions, where the winner was the person who could eat the most, full stop. The foods back then were simpler, and unbranded. People competed over onions, eggs, watermelon and pies. The contests were \u201cvery lighthearted,\u201d she said, and not nearly as physically taxing as they are today \u2014 they were \u201cathletic like a three legged race is athletic.\u201d When Nathan\u2019s starting putting on its annual event in the 1970s, it looked more like those early contests. At the time, PR mavens Max Rosey and Mortimer Matz thought a hot dog eating competition would drum up some publicity for Nathan\u2019s. (They also seem to have made up the legend that the first Nathan\u2019s contest was held in 1916). Back then, \u201cthere was still kind of like a local flavor to it \u2026 the competitors were mostly just big guys from Long Island,\u201d Fagone told CNN. Contestants would enter, rapidly eat some hot dogs and go back home to their own barbecues, he said. Melody Andorfer was the winner of the first official Nathan\u2019s contest in 1972, according to the Coney Island History Project. She ate 12 hot dogs in 5 minutes \u2014 beating all other competitors, men and women, she told the non-profit in an interview in 2020. That first year, Nathan\u2019s used barrels and a plank of wood to make the competitors table, she recalled. \u201cThey put a white plastic tablecloth there. In front of you, they put on a paper plate hot dogs and no mustard, nothing to drink. Just the hot dogs.\u201d A couple of decades later, in the 1990s, brothers George and Richard Shea took over marketing for Nathan\u2019s. George Shea, who still hosts the competition, helped turn the homespun event into a gigantic spectacle. Hot dog publicity Americans say the annual competition is about many things: Coney Island, the Fourth of July, patriotism \u2014 but the event that kicked off the rise of mainstream competitive eating in the United States is, at its core, about publicity, the man who runs the contest said. \u201cIt is a sport that did not start as a sport. It was a platform for exposure for Nathan\u2019s and certainly many other brands in the years that followed,\u201d said George Shea, who co-founded Major League Eating, the professional league that now oversees the competition. Shea took over the contest in 1991 when Rosey died. Before Shea stepped in, he said, the contests included a couple of cameras, a handful of competitors and \u201c15 or 20 onlookers who just happened to be passersby and stopped.\u201d As host, Shea cultivated a persona designed to hype the event. He stands on stage in a flat-top straw hat and a suit and tie. Leading up to the contest, he makes grand proclamations about life and poetry as dramatic music plays. When announcing competitors, he builds up anticipation, treating the event more like a boxing match than a hot dog eating contest. The act is \u201ca little bit of Coney Island, it\u2019s a little bit of sports reporter, it\u2019s a little bit of apocalyptic preacher,\u201d Shea said. \u201cThe whole thing is just fantastic. You get up there, there are no rules, you say and do whatever you want and it\u2019s all about getting in motion, expressing the emotion \u2026 and universally the reaction I get from people is just \u2018this is not what I expected and I really love it,\u2019\u201d Shea said. It took a while to bring that performance to the mainstream. About a decade into his tenure as leader of the competition, Shea pitched a story to the LA Times. The ensuing article introduced the idea to a new part of the country, he said. After that, Shea signed deals for a documentary and TV special \u2014 just as superstar Takeru Kobayashi came onto the scene in 2001 and \u201cblew it open,\u201d Shea said. \u201cIt was coincidental and very mutually beneficial \u2014 the timing was very good because he had enormous star power,\u201d Shea said. The first year he participated in the contest, Kobayashi ate 50 hot dogs \u2014\u00a0nearly double the 2000 winner. Kobayashi showed \u201cthat you could treat (the contest) as an athletic activity and excel,\u201d Fagone said. The Japanese newcomer had taken the pursuit seriously, training and coming up with a novel way to approach the contest (separate hot dogs from buns and snap the frankfurters in half before eating). The intensity of the training, and the achievement, lent legitimacy to the whole endeavor. A few years later, ESPN started broadcasting the event. An American tradition, for better or worse For some, competitive eating is a symbol of American culture \u2014 the good and the bad. Eating contests are \u201ca celebration of excess,\u201d Bitar said, part and parcel of the myth of America that attracted immigrants when the country was still young. They represent \u201cthis larger fantasy, this national American fairy tale about consuming without consequence.\u201d Kobayashi himself has pierced that fantasy, revealing in a Netflix documentary show called \u201cHack Your Health\u201d that he no longer feels hunger and that he\u2019s worried competitive eating may have lasting ramifications for his health. (Nevertheless, he plans to compete against Chestnut in an upcoming Netflix special). The contests have staying power in part because of their shock value, Bitar said. Competitive eating \u201cbreaks all sorts of etiquette and social norms,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of these moments where all of our rules are broken.\u201d Shea also pointed to an underlying tension as a reason that Americans still watch the Nathan\u2019s hot dog eating contest after all these years. He described it as the \u201celement of \u2018wait you\u2019re not supposed to do that\u2019 and \u2018I can\u2019t believe he\u2019s doing that or she\u2019s doing that.\u2019\u201d But he sees the contest as a special event, one that symbolizes something else: happiness. \u201cIt goes to New York City history \u2026 but more important, hot dogs represent to me the joy of summer.\u201d Beatrice Fellman, 25, agrees. The Coney Island visitor, who described the hot dog as \u201cAmerica\u2019s meal\u201d on that warm day in June, said it stands for \u201cpatriotism and a good time.\u201d Fellman was one of many on a crowded boardwalk, flooded with hundreds of beachgoers trying to soak up the sun, carrying towels and beach chairs. The mood was celebratory. Bass bumped from speakers and a live band played to about a dozen people dancing. Despite the heat, there were lines at both Nathan\u2019s locations, where people waited for the famous hot dogs and crinkle-cut french fries. \u201cWe love the Nathan\u2019s hot dog eating competition because we love how it brings the city together,\u201d Fellman said, standing with a group of her friends, all wearing Nathan\u2019s hot dog eating contest T-shirts. \u201cIt celebrates a beautiful American comfort food that is the hot dog.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/29/business/nathans-famous-competitive-eating-hot-dogs/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/01/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk", "text": "In a year of wild tech stories that has seen Elon Musk transform Twitter, cryptocurrency exchange FTX collapse and Silicon Valley Bank implode, this week\u2019s whiplash-inducing turmoil at OpenAI is among the most captivating. Sam Altman \u2014 the leader of one of the world\u2019s most influential AI companies, OpenAI, and perhaps the\u00a0most visible figure in the fledgling industry \u2014 was fired Friday night by the startup\u2019s directors in a surprise move. Less than five days later, he\u2019s back as the company\u2019s CEO, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. The series of extraordinary events unfolded just days after OpenAI held its\u00a0first-ever developer conference, where it laid out new, commercialized versions of its technology, including the option to customize its ChatGPT AI chatbot. If you\u2019re just catching up, here\u2019s what you missed from a week so incredible you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking the script could have been written by an early version of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Friday Around 3 p.m. ET, Altman joined a Google Meet call with most of OpenAI\u2019s board that had been convened by fellow co-founder and OpenAI chief scientist\u00a0Ilya Sutskever, during which Altman was fired and told that the news would soon be made public. Within the next half hour, the board also informed Greg Brockman, another co-founder and OpenAI president, that he would be removed from the board. Around 3:30 p.m. ET, OpenAI publicly announced that it had fired Altman over concerns that he was not always truthful with the board. The board said Mira Murati, the company\u2019s chief technology officer, would become interim CEO. OpenAI\u2019s strategic partners, including its biggest financial backer Microsoft, were also reportedly informed of Altman\u2019s ouster just minutes before the board\u2019s announcement. Hours after being fired, Altman posted on X that he \u201cloved working with such talented people\u201d and that he would have \u201cmore to say about what\u2019s next later.\u201d Brockman promptly quit. \u201cPlease don\u2019t spend any time being concerned. We will be fine,\u201d Brockman\u00a0said in a Friday post\u00a0on X. \u201cGreater things coming soon.\u201d A key factor in the CEO\u2019s firing was\u00a0tension between Altman, who favored developing AI\u00a0more aggressively, and members of the OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the unfolding events. Saturday Within 24 hours of Altman being fired, reports emerged that he and other ex-OpenAI loyalists were mulling plans for their own venture. OpenAI\u2019s board was also reportedly having second thoughts and considering asking the ousted CEO to return. Sunday By Sunday afternoon, Altman was\u00a0back at OpenAI\u2019s headquarters\u00a0\u2014 this time with a guest badge \u2014 to negotiate his potential return. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reportedly mediated the discussion. A 5 p.m. PT deadline was reportedly set for the board to agree to Altman\u2019s demands, including adding a seat for Microsoft, and reinstating him as CEO. But those talks broke down. As Sunday turned into Monday, Nadella tweeted that Altman, along with Brockman, would join Microsoft to run a new AI research group. At OpenAI, the group found a new interim CEO: Emmett Shear, the former CEO of Amazon\u2019s streaming service, Twitch. Murati would return to her role as OpenAI\u2019s chief technology officer. Monday In a post on X early Monday, Shear, who left his role at Twitch in March, described the chance to join OpenAI as \u201ca once-in-a-lifetime\u201d opportunity. He added that the company would hire an independent investigator to report on what happened in the lead-up to Altman\u2019s firing. But OpenAI employees were not convinced. More than 500 staffers signed an open letter calling on the company\u2019s board to resign and reinstate Altman and Brockman. They also threatened to follow the co-founders to Microsoft if their demands were not met. Altman posted on X, saying, \u201cwe have more unity and commitment and focus than ever before. we are all going to work together some way or other, and i\u2019m so excited. one team, one mission.\u201d The drama was far from over.\u00a0The Verge reported Monday afternoon\u00a0that Altman and Brockman could still return to OpenAI if the board members who fired him resign. And Nadella, speaking to CNBC, said he was \u201copen to both options\u201d when asked whether Altman would actually join Microsoft. \u201cLook, that is for the OpenAI board and management and the employees to choose,\u201d Nadella said. \u201cWe chose to explicitly partner with OpenAI and we want to continue to do so, and obviously, that depends on the people of OpenAI staying there or coming to Microsoft.\u201d Tuesday Altman\u00a0was reinstated late Tuesday as OpenAI\u2019s CEO, the company said on X. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman\u00a0wrote\u00a0that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his\u00a0post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it has backed with billions to bolster its ambitions in developing AI. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Nadella\u00a0said\u00a0on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/01/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "chipotle-portion-sizes-smaller-test", "text": "Leave it to a Wells Fargo restaurant analyst to decisively settle the Chipotle burrito \u201cweight debate.\u201d On TikTok, some customers accused Chipotle of skimping on food portions. They started a trend of filming Chipotle employees as the workers built out their burritos order with chicken, guacamole and other add-ons in an effort to get larger scoops. The trend, dubbed the \u201cChipotle phone method,\u201d went viral on social media, and some employees pushed back on it, saying customers filming them was \u201cstressful and dehumanizing.\u201d Chipotle\u2019s CEO eventually addressed the issue. \u201cThe portions have not gotten smaller,\u201d Chipotle CEO Brian Niccol recently told Fortune. \u201cWe always want to give people big portions that get them excited about the food.\u201d He said that if customers want a little more rice or another topping, they can ask an employee. So Wells Fargo analyst Zachary Fadem went out to Chipotle to do some investigative work. Fadem and his team ordered and weighed 75 burrito bowls with white rice, black beans, chicken, pico de gallo, cheese and lettuce across 8 Chipotle locations in New York City. (They brought them back to the office for other Wells Fargo employees\u2019 lunch.) The analysts found that the consistency of the portions varied widely. The bowls weighed roughly the same for in-store orders and online orders, but some locations served bowls that weigh 33% more than other locations. Some burrito bowls went to extremes, with one topping out at 27 ounces in one location, and a meager 14 ounces in another. The median weight was around 21.5 ounces. Laurie Schalow, Chipotle\u2019s chief corporate affairs officer, told CNN that Chipotle\u2019s bowl size may vary depending upon the number of ingredients a customer selects or if they choose to make an ingredient extra or light. She said the company has not changed its portion sizes. Portion size consistency is important for restaurants because it helps them manage costs and prevent from running out of ingredients or having too much left over. Customers go to restaurant chains for consistency, and if portion sizes are not standardized it could hurt a chain\u2019s reputation, analysts say. Many brands have been criticized for shrinking their product sizes and charging the same or more, known as \u201cshrinkflation.\u201d This does not seem to be hurting Chipotle, however. Despite the social media complaints, Chipotle\u2019s sales grew 7% last quarter, and the company\u2019s sales are outpacing rivals such as McDonald\u2019s.", "source": "http://cnn.com/chipotle-portion-sizes-smaller-test/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/01/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_29_economy_economic-data-messy-elections", "text": "Politics typically comes with plenty of spin. Even something seemingly unyielding or absolute like a number can get squished and twisted like putty. As such, flashy economic data points extolled by candidates always come with plenty of asterisks, caveats and \u201cyes, buts.\u201d In this election cycle, those qualifiers have multiplied in part due to quirks in the numbers themselves: A once-in-a-lifetime pandemic and a once-in-a-generation inflation event sent shockwaves through the economy, distorting data and presidential economic records in the process. \u201cInterpreting economic data is like interpreting a Monet painting in the best of times,\u201d Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, told CNN in an interview. \u201cBut in these times, it\u2019s a Monet painting with the Picasso overlaid on top of it. Very difficult to interpret.\u201d During Thursday night\u2019s presidential debate between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, the echoes from those events were on full display as the candidates sparred over the economy. \u201cTrump blamed Biden for inflation; that\u2019s misplaced because I don\u2019t think either of them were to blame \u2014 the pandemic and Russian war were to blame,\u201d Zandi said. \u201cWhen President Biden takes credit for all jobs and says Trump lost all the jobs? That\u2019s not fair either, because the pandemic really scrambled things.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think either candidate is on very strong ground by looking at history to discern whether their policies are good or bad. You\u2019d have to use different criteria,\u201d he added. Not yet at a steady state Economists, analysts and business journalists can try to tease out portions of the data to try to make better comparisons (one approach Zandi has taken is to evaluate the economy under Trump in 2019 to that of Biden in 2023); however, even once tried-and-true metrics might not tell the full story right now as these shocks are still working their way through the system. \u201cThe economy has not settled into a steady-state equilibrium following the pandemic,\u201d Joe Brusuelas, principal and chief economist at RSM US, told CNN. \u201cAnd until it does, we won\u2019t have a real good sense of what the new metrics are that reflect the direction in the economy and consumer confidence.\u201d Twenty years ago, presidential elections came down to \u201cjobs, jobs, jobs,\u201d Brusuelas said. One could take a quick glance at the unemployment rate and the 13-week average of initial jobless claims and get a pretty good sense of who\u2019s going to win the election, he said. \u201cThat\u2019s just simply not the case anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cThese elections are much more complex. They\u2019re about deeper cultural affinities and cultural identities, and it\u2019s scrambled the picture when we try to connect what\u2019s going on in the economy.\u201d Brusuelas said one of his own favorite go-tos in helping to predict election outcomes has changed as well. High labor participation rates for women in their prime working age (25 to 54) was favorable to the incumbent, especially if that person was a Democrat. That participation rate hit a fresh record high in May; however, the increase possibly could be a reflection of the aftereffect of price shocks and women having to stream back into the workforce to make up for lost income elsewhere, he said. \u201cWe could go on, there are all kinds of other metrics out there that 20 or 30 years ago would have been surefire indications of what\u2019s going to happen in November,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think this year that they\u2019re that effective. And they may never be again, because of the changing nature of the economy and society.\u201d Protein and petrol Take for example the S&P 500. It\u2019s been going gangbusters and riding the high of Nvidia and the hype around artificial intelligence. But when you bring that down to the ground level and the individual person, it\u2019s a different dynamic. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be thinking, \u2018Wait a minute, all this money\u2019s going into this and can replace the job that guys like me do? I don\u2019t care if the unemployment rate\u2019s 4%. I\u2019m at risk,\u2019\u201d he said. For the average person, the economic data only means so much anyways, Brusuelas said, adding that it comes down to \u201cprotein and petrol\u201d versus percentage points. \u201cAt the end of the day, if we\u2019re talking about the American household, the price of eggs, the price of gas is how this is understood,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s things they see every week.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/29/economy/economic-data-messy-elections/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/01/2024", "section": "business"}}
