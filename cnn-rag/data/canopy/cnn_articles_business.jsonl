Even after years of inflation, geopolitical chaos and recession in Europe, the US economy remains robust and resilient. The reason for that is mostly the American consumer, with spending accounting for about 70% of gross domestic product. But some observers now worry that the economy represents a tale of two Americas. Some businesses and consumers continue to thrive, while others are falling by the wayside. What\u2019s happening: Economic activity in the US remains relatively strong, but there are some signs that the momentum is beginning to cool. Unemployment rose to 3.9% last month, lower-income consumers are spending less and businesses are limiting employee hours and pay. Consumer growth in general is beginning to moderate, but gently. \u201cThat may mask more pronounced financial difficulties for the bottom three income quintiles facing the strenuous combination of higher prices, larger interest burdens and softening job prospects,\u201d said EY chief economist Gregory Daco in a note on Tuesday. While consumer balance sheets are still holding strong in aggregate \u2014 the US has added $40 trillion in wealth since the start of 2020, and Americans haven\u2019t stopped spending \u2014not every balance sheet looks the same. \u201cThe economy is bifurcated into the haves and have-nots, as middle class Americans are struggling with rising prices and lagging wage growth,\u201d said Skyler Weinand, chief investment officer at Regan Capital in a statement. This earnings season exemplifies that growing divide. McDonald\u2019s (MCD) reported that people of all income levels are seeking value. Starbucks (SBUX) said that customers are becoming more particular about where they spend their money. Mondelez (MDLZ) executives discussed an increase in price sensitivity in their earnings call. A recent survey by Santander Bank of its customers found that while inflation fears have largely subsided, middle-income Americans are pessimistic about the economy. About 60% believe the US will enter a recession in the next 12 months, and 62% are making significant cuts to their household spending, the bank found. \u201cIt\u2019s well known that the lowest income consumer is really struggling with inflation, but from a purely economic standpoint, it is the higher quintiles of earners that do the most spending,\u201d Nanette Abuhoff Jacobson, global investment strategist at Hartford Funds, told my colleague Bryan Mena. Why it matters: There are many shapes to a recession. Some economists have speculated that the US has been in a so-called \u201crolling recession\u201d where only certain sectors of the economy are impacted. But there are also recessions that mostly hurt lower-income Americans. A K-shaped recession is what happens when separate communities are hit by and recover from economic downturns at varying rates. Some parts of society may experience renewed growth while others continue to lag behind. While the recovery from the 2020 recession can be described as V-shaped, many point out that it was actually two-pronged. Low-income Black and Hispanic families saw the fastest depletion of their savings during the pandemic, for example. Many who worked in white-collar jobs recovered quickly as the government handed out stimulus payments and as stocks and home prices appreciated. Those without savings and who worked service jobs continued to suffer. Employees receiving the lowest wages were the most likely to lose their jobs in nearly every sector of the economy between 2020 and 2021, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Those Americans could still be suffering, but their stories are obscured by data that paints a broad picture of a resilient economy. What\u2019s next: That bifurcated economy, wrote Daco, will lead some businesses to succeed while others struggle. It \u201cwill also lead to conflicting inflation signals with some sectors experiencing outright deflation and others experiencing persistently elevated inflation,\u201d he said. That could make it a lot more difficult for Federal Reserve officials to decide whether to lower interest rates or keep them steady during their next few policy meetings. There\u2019s a danger that if monetary policy is too strict, it could quickly make financial conditions tougher, said Daco. \u201cThis, along with growing concerns about the country\u2019s financial direction, might cause businesses and consumers to pull back on spending and investment,\u201d he said. Jamie Dimon could step down sooner than expected. Here\u2019s who could run the country\u2019s biggest bank JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has bumped up his retirement plans, the longtime head of America\u2019s largest bank said Monday. Dimon is one of the most well-known and closely listened to CEOs in the world. Over the course of his tenure at JPMorgan Chase, he\u2019s become somewhat synonymous with the largest US bank by assets. But Dimon can\u2019t lead forever, and at 68 years old, the\u00a0question of succession\u00a0has grown more important. The timetable for stepping down \u2014 which he has long joked was \u201cfive years away\u201d any time the question was put to him \u2014 is \u201cnot five years anymore,\u201d Dimon said at the bank\u2019s investor conference this week. Dimon, who has led the bank since 2006, said that while \u201cI still have the energy I\u2019ve always had, I think when I can\u2019t put on the jersey \u2026 I should leave.\u201d Succession plans at the bank, he said, are \u201cwell on the way.\u201d Shares of the company\u2019s stock sold off after Dimon\u2019s announcement, closing 4.3% lower. \u201cWe believe that it will take time for the street to gain comfort with the next CEO and [Monday\u2019s] stock reaction was evidence of that,\u201d wrote Bank of America analysts in a note on Tuesday.\u00a0\u201cDimon\u00a0has delivered unparalleled shareholder returns during his tenure as CEO while navigating the bank through some major macro-economic crises.\u201d The Bank of America analysts forecast that Dimon will step down in late 2025 or 2026, but the specifics of JPMorgan\u2019s succession plans have been the subject of speculation on Wall Street for many years. Earlier this year, some of the bank\u2019s top executives were moved into new roles in order to expand their experience. The bank appointed Marianne Lake as the sole CEO of the consumer division, an area previously run by both Lake and Jennifer Piepszak. Piepszak, meanwhile, now leads the company\u2019s newly combined commercial and investment bank with her co-CEO Troy Rohrbaugh. Rohrbaugh is the former head of trading and securities services for the bank. Other potential successors include Mary Erdoes, CEO of asset and wealth management; chief financial officer Jeremy Barnum and president and chief operating officer Daniel Pinto. In 2020, Dimon experienced an \u201cacute aortic dissection\u201d \u2014 a tear in the inner lining of the aorta blood vessel \u2014 requiring surgery. Then co-COOs Gordon Smith and Daniel Pinto\u00a0led the company in his absence. Smith retired from the bank in January 2022. Microsoft thinks it has found a way to make PCs relevant again Microsoft\u00a0jumped headfirst into building artificial intelligence directly into its Windows operating system on Monday, announcing new AI computers that could help ramp up flagging PC sales. The\u00a0developments push the company closer to its long-time goal\u00a0to \u201cbuild computers that understand us versus us having to understand computers,\u201d\u00a0CEO Satya Nadella told the audience\u00a0at the company\u2019s annual developer conference\u00a0at its Redmond, Washington headquarters. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re really close to that real breakthrough,\u201d he added. The computers, which are packed with processors that power advanced AI tools, come\u00a0as PC sales have stalled for years. The company hopes the new machines\u00a0will\u00a0boost sales and revive excitement, particularly\u00a0as\u00a0AI is expected to become increasingly part of everyday life.

{"id": "2024_05_18_business_under-armour-kevin-plank-shoes", "text": "It was once hyped as a worthy rival to Nike. But at present, Under Armour, founded by a 23-year-old former college athlete, is struggling  to  \u201cjust do it.\u201d Instead, the brand that\u2019s championed on the basketball court by Stephen Curry and on the golf course by Jordan Spieth, is now struggling \u2014 badly \u2014 to find its footing in an increasingly competitive and crowded sportwear marketplace for regular folks, where younger shoppers are more googly-eyed over newer entrants like Hoka and On running shoes. Under Armour\u2019s annual sales have been sluggish at best for the past several years, while its stock has plunged 88% from its all-time high in 2015. Industry experts said the company is mired in an unpleasant mix of problems, which include an identity crisis, several management controversies, ignoring evolving market trends to its detriment, and a rotating carousel of CEOs in quick succession. One of them is Kevin Plank, its founder, who is back at the helm for a second time as CEO after being replaced in 2019. Similar to Starbucks founder Howard Schultz\u2019s past returns to Starbucks and Disney chief Bob Iger\u2019s recent return as CEO, Plank aims to right the ship at Under Armour. \u201cWhen Under Armour was growing at 20% plus numbers, people saw it as a legitimate competitor to Nike,\u201d said David Swartz, senior equity analyst with research firm Morningstar, in an interview with CNN. \u201cIt was like On or Hoka but 10 years ago. It was the upstart athletic brand that was making real inroads against Nike, the dominant name in the industry. People saw it as a company that actually could break through and take market share from Nike among the hardcore athletes,\u201d Swartz said. \u201cThat actually did happen for a while, but then that didn\u2019t last.\u201d Plank launched Under Armour in 1996 to be what the name suggests \u2014 a protective layer of clothing worn by competitive athletes sweating it out in the heat of the game. The first product was a fitted T-shirt called \u201cThe Shorty,\u201d made from moisture-wicking fabric for elite athletes to wear under their uniforms to keep them dry. Its iconic Under Armour intertwined \u201cU\u201d and \u201cA\u201d logo was strategically placed on the neckline, to keep it conspicuous. The T-shirt eventually launched the brand to the masses after it quickly gained fandom among the ranks of professional athletes. The startup\u2019s fast track to success led to Under Armour going public in 2005. It\u2019s early slogan: \u201cProtect This House.\u201d By 2010, the business had crossed $1 billion in sales. Five years later, sales surpassed $4 billion. But then the momentum started to wane. Protracted period of pain The past eight years for Under Armour have been a struggle that doesn\u2019t appear to be abating. The company on Thursday announced a restructuring of its business as its North America sales in its most recent quarter tumbled 10%. Looking ahead, the company cast a dour forecast for its current fiscal year, expecting sales to drop 15% to 17%. Layoffs will be part of the effort to right the ship but executives did not specify how many employees will lose their jobs. Under Armour also announced a $500 million share buyback, a move to reward shareholders. Plank told analysts during the earnings call on Thursday that he will shepherd a reset of the business that centers on selling fewer but more innovative products to meet the needs of athletes, significantly accelerating product development, refocusing on its men\u2019s apparel category and reducing discounts of its products. \u201cWe are simply doing too much stuff. There are too many products, too many initiatives. To reconstitute this brand, we must be highly focused and prioritize what needs to get done so that our teams know exactly what to do with a clear definition of success for them,\u201d Plank said. It can\u2019t be ignored that management issues, too, have plagued the business for years, Swartz said. \u201cThe company has essentially had five CEOs in the past five years, if you count Kevin Plank twice,\u201d said Swartz. Plank was announced as CEO \u2014 again \u2014 in March, ending the very brief year-long tenure of Stephanie Linnartz. Plank conceded during the analysts call Thursday that frequent C-suite turnover had become a serious impediment to success. \u201cWith several CEOs and heads of product, marketing in North America over the past half-decade, ongoing turnover of critical leadership has been central to our inability to stay agile and decisive,\u201d he said. String of controversies The period from 2016 onward is when \u201cthings really started to fall apart\u201d at Under Armour, Swartz said. A huge issue arose when an important channel of distribution for the brand went bankrupt and closed stores. A bulk of Under Armour products are sold through sporting goods retailers and department stores, including Macy\u2019s and Kohl\u2019s, and online. \u201cWhen Sports Authority went bankrupt in 2016 it really hurt Under Armour. It was a major customer of the brand, as is Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods,\u201d Schwartz said. In 2020, UCLA sued Under Armour for ending a $280 million sponsorship deal. The suit alleged that Under Armour was struggling before Covid-19 and that it used the pandemic as a reason to get out of the deal. The 15-year sponsorship deal, signed in 2016, was the\u00a0largest in the history\u00a0of college sports at the time. In exchange for the $280 million, UCLA\u2019s student athletes and personnel would wear and use Under Armour\u00a0(UA)-supplied products exclusively. The company reached a settlement with UCLA. The following year, Under Armour paid $9 million to settle a multi-year investigation with the US Securities and Exchange Commission into its past accounting practices, according to Footwear News. Outside of other bad press for Plank, competitors were gaining ground on Under Armour, whose high-performance sportwear offerings weren\u2019t best suited for the Lululemon-driven athleisure trend that had emerged and then dominated the way consumers dressed through the pandemic. \u201cUnder Armour has failed to latch upon streetwear, or sports style that catapulted On or Hoka or Merrell,\u201d said Zak Stambor, senior analyst, retail and ecommerce, with market research firm eMarketer, in an interview with CNN. \u201cIt needs to figure out what is next. If it can\u2019t do that, then it needs to quickly latch upon what another brand has identified as the next big thing.\u201d Stambor questioned Plank\u2019s decision to pull back from discounts at a time when consumers are hyper focused on value. \u201cIt carries the risk of decreasing demand particularly when you don\u2019t have a must-have product,\u201d he said. Stambor said this decision also stands in stark contrast to a recent move that rival Adidas has made to roll out cheaper versions of their must-have shoes. Despite it\u2019s significant challenges, Stambor said Under Armour can remain relevant in the market. \u201cIt is a very large company with huge revenue. It\u2019s not as though the brand has fully diminished in standing. It\u2019s a bit stuck,\u201d he said. \u201cUnder Armour needs to identify what it is that consumers want and lean heavily in that direction. It hasn\u2019t fully shown an ability to do so over the past few years,\u201d he said. One area that\u2019s going strong is the brand\u2019s long-term celebrity-brand partnerships, said Eric Smallwood, president of Apex Marketing Group, a sports and entertainment firm that evaluates sponsorships and advertising campaigns. \u201cUnder Armour\u2019s relationship with the \u2018The Rock\u2019, Dwayne Johnson, has been pretty effective. They\u2019ve expanded to the United Football League, which is the football league that Johnson co-owns,\u201d Smallwood said. \u201cTheir uniforms are Under Armour.\u201d Golf is another area where the brand is making inroads while the Stephen Curry partnership has kept the brand visible in the basketball world, Smallwood said. The basketball superstar Curry, arguably the best shooter in history, famously signed with Under Armour instead of Nike in 2013. Meanwhile, the brand\u2019s other major NBA star, Joel Embiid, quit Under Armour in 2023 a few months after he was named the league\u2019s most valuable player. Embiid signed a shoe deal with Skechers last month. Under Armour reportedly bid hard for a shoe deal with WNBA phenom Caitlin Clark, who many expect will sign with Nike. \u201cThe bottomline for Under Armour is for the brand to be clear about its identity,\u201d he said. \u201cAre they a shoe company? Are they an apparel company? At one point everyone else copied their mositure-wicking undershirt. Then maybe they had an identity crisis. It\u2019s going to come down to deciding if they want to evolve into a lifestyle brand or stay in performance-based products.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/18/business/under-armour-kevin-plank-shoes/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_homes_sales-us-housing-market", "text": "Rising US home prices are heightening the housing affordability crisis for Americans, especially first-time buyers. The median price of a previously owned home in the US grew 5.7% in April from a year earlier to $407,600, according to data from the National Association of Realtors released Wednesday. That was the fourth consecutive monthly increase and was a record for April prices. Another gauge of prices by S&P Global has similarly showed that US home-price growth accelerated throughout the beginning of the year, especially in San Diego, Chicago and Detroit. Housing affordability takes into account prices, household incomes and mortgage rates. Put together, it\u2019s been a difficult time for prospective buyers, though the increase in prices has been a boon for homeowners since it means their wealth has grown. NAR also reported that existing home sales, which make up the vast majority of transactions, fell 1.9% in April to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.14 million. Sales fell in April for the second month in a row, declining across the country, as mortgage rates surged past 7%. One shred of good news for housing in America, however, is that more homes are continuing to come to market. \u201cThe upper-end market is experiencing a sizable gain due to more supply coming onto the market,\u201d said Lawrence Yun, NAR\u2019s chief economist, in a release. He added that \u201chome prices reaching a record high for the month of April is very good news for homeowners.\u201d A stalled recovery for the housing market The US housing market\u2019s recovery from earlier in the year was cut short when it became clear the Federal Reserve likely won\u2019t cut interest rates in the first half of 2024 \u2014 right as the crucial spring homebuying season kicked into high gear. After plunging to multi-decade lows last fall, home sales began to rebound in early 2024 as housing supply improved and hopes grew that the Fed would begin to cut interest rates imminently. Then came signs that inflation\u2019s slowdown had stalled. Mortgage rates track the yield on the 10-year US Treasury note, which moves in anticipation of the Fed\u2019s decisions on interest rates. Hotter-than-expected inflation readings sent bond yields surging and mortgage rates followed suit. The standard 30-year fixed-rate mortgage surged past 7% in April, according to Freddie Mac data. At the same time, home prices continued to climb, tightening the grip on buyers. Low housing affordability typically crimps demand. Yet that somehow didn\u2019t deter some first-time buyers. The share of buyers who bought a home for the first time rose to 33% in April from 32% in March. \u201cI don\u2019t know how they are able to do it,\u201d Yun said. \u201cMaybe later we will find out that they got some help from family members in terms of a down payment.\u201d Housing supply continues to improve America\u2019s housing market indeed remains tough for many, but one key issue has improved throughout this year. A chronic lack of available homes has been a longstanding issue for the market, putting upward pressure on prices and limiting buyers\u2019 choices. The tide seems to have turned for now. Total housing inventory at the end of April was 1.21 million units, up 9% from the prior month and 16.3% from a year earlier, NAR said. That was the fourth consecutive monthly increase in housing inventory, but it\u2019s still not keeping up with demand. \u201cWe still have tight inventory, despite the fact that we\u2019ve had this increase,\u201d Yun said. \u201cIt is still a very frustrating market out there. Home prices are at record highs, mortgage rates are high and a lack of inventory to some degree looks like it is hindering sales.\u201d This story has been updated with additional details and context.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/homes/sales-us-housing-market/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_media_india-elections-press-freedom-decline-intl-hnk", "text": "These days, journalist Siddique Kappan avoids controversial stories. Last time he chased a major story, a shocking rape-and-murder case, it landed the father of three in jail for more than two years, and severely damaged his career and livelihood. The 44-year-old blames his incarceration on a worsening climate for journalists in India, where arrests and harassment are growing more common. And he is far from the only journalist feeling squeezed out of their industry during Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s decade-long rule. The government of the popular but divisive leader - who has not taken a single solo press conference while in office - stands accused by opponents of suppressing media pluralism and ratcheting up the use of anti-terror legislation against reporters. And as Modi looks to win another five years in power in an ongoing nationwide election, critics fear further erosion of the protections afforded to India\u2019s free press. \u201cI think many times before I write stories,\u201d Kappan told CNN. \u201cAnytime, anywhere, anyone can file a case against me.\u201d In October 2020, Kappan was working as a freelancer for a Malayalam-language news website. He was on his way to Hathras district, in northern Uttar Pradesh state, to report on the alleged gang rape and killing of a Dalit teenager by upper-caste men. India\u2019s caste system was officially abolished decades ago, but the social hierarchy imposed on people by birth still exists in many aspects of life. Dalits are on the lowest rung. Before he arrived at the scene, he was taken into police custody, charged under anti-terror and money laundering laws. The police alleged he was part of a conspiracy to disturb the peace in the area, but he said his arrest was an attempt to tamp down on coverage of the story. He would spend 28 months in jail. Kappan was granted bail by the Supreme Court in February 2023, but while he currently walks free, his case is still making its way through the courts. Opposing his bail, the Uttar Pradesh government, led by Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court. In the document, seen by CNN, it argued against bail on the grounds Kappan had been \u201cwriting articles targeted at spreading communal tensions\u201d and was a part of a larger conspiracy to \u201cfoment religious discord and spread terror in the country.\u201d CNN has contacted the BJP at both the local and national level for comment on the case. Since his bail, Kappan has struggled to find a permanent job to provide for his family. \u201cThe main reason is the fear of newspaper bosses, the media, which depends on government advertisement, who do not want to upset the government,\u201d he told CNN. He says he is wary of more cases being brought against him, and finds himself working on \u201csafe zone\u201d stories unlikely to ruffle feathers. The treatment of journalists like Kappan has struck fear into many other reporters. \u201cThere was nothing Kappan could have done differently to avoid arrest, except not going to report,\u201d said Kaushik Raj, who works with several publications and writes on hate crimes. \u201cThis was chilling for me.\u201d India is one of the largest media markets in the world, according to the Paris-based group Reporters Without Borders (RSF), with more than 20,000 daily newspapers across the country and about 450 privately owned channels dedicated to news, which broadcast in dozens of languages. Yet despite its size and diversity, critics say the media industry is growing increasingly subservient to Modi\u2019s government. \u201cThere was a blend of public service, public interest and corporate private media that served a burgeoning urban middle class, but also showed interest in issues of rural development. Journalists were respected\u2026 Regulatory mechanisms were weak but not completely absent,\u201d said Shakuntala Banaji, professor of media, culture and social change at the London School of Economics. \u201cThey have been all but destroyed in the last 10 years,\u201d she added. According to RSF, the country fell 25 places on the Press Freedom Index between 2015 and 2023, to 161st place \u2013 below neighboring Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Nepal. In the latest index for this year it rose slightly to 159th place but remains below all neighbors except Bangladesh (165th). \u201cThere has been a sharp deterioration in the status of media over the last ten years,\u201d Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) India representative Kunal Majumder told CNN, adding that this included imprisonment and invoking terror laws to criminalize journalists. According to the CPJ, 21 journalists were imprisoned in India between 2014 and 2023, up from four between 2004 and 2013. There has also been an uptick, it said, in the use of anti-terror laws \u2013 which allow for detention without trial or charge for up to 180 days \u2013 against reporters. Police have used the same anti-terror law against a website linked to a left-leaning organisation critical of the government. In a charge sheet filed to the court recently and seen by CNN, police claimed NewsClick was responsible for stoking riots that hit New Delhi in 2020, spreading disinformation around Covid, and funding terror groups. In a statement, NewsClick said the claims were absurd and baseless, and were intended to \u201ctarget independent journalism.\u201d Its editor Prabir Purkayastha was in jail from October 3 until Wednesday, when the Supreme Court granted him bail, saying his arrest and remand were \u201cinvalid in the eyes of law.\u201d \u201cWhen the state resorts to using anti-terror laws to shut down the freedom of expression of journalists holding institutions to account, then we are deep in authoritarian rule,\u201d said Banaji from LSE. Asked about this apparent increase in hostility to journalists, Kanchan Gupta, senior advisor to the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, told CNN that media workers were not above the law. \u201cIf journalists violate the law they are open to prosecution and legal action,\u201d he said. Shrinking independent media Alleged harassment of reporters has worsened too, according to press freedom groups. The Amnesty 2022 release says Hindu nationalists feel emboldened to threaten and abuse journalists critical of the government. Ravish Kumar, one of the country\u2019s best-known journalists, said he has not felt safe for many years while people from various Hindu-nationalist organisations showered him with death threats and abuse. The face of New Delhi Television (NDTV) for more than two decades, Kumar said he chose to resign when he was told he would have to toe the government line. He said he was driven to this decision during a hostile takeover of the channel by billionaire Gautam Adani in late 2022. CNN has contacted NDTV for comment. Kumar told CNN he resigned because Adani\u2019s proximity to Modi and the BJP would leave him unable to continue asking tough questions of the government. Soon after, he started his own YouTube channel with a small team that has about 10 million subscribers. He said he took to YouTube \u2013 where his videos receive at least a million views within their first 24 hours - because there was no other option left. \u201cThere is no place for people like us in Indian media anymore,\u201d he said. Critics say TV news has been overrun by pro-government voices. With the world\u2019s largest election underway, a study of prime-time shows by media watchdog Newslaundry - that tracked more than 400 segments between February 1 and April 12 - showed that 52% of airtime was spent criticizing the opposition, while another 27% pushed pro-Modi narratives. For Kumar the pluralism of India\u2019s past is fast disappearing. \u201cThere is very little time and space left, so we\u2019re living our last moments,\u201d he said. But Gupta, of the information ministry, said it was \u201cnot true\u201d that the media toes a government line. \u201cThere are 903 satellite channels in the country,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you look at the headlines across newspapers and television channels you will see that this generalization is not true.\u201d \u201cThis entire thing of saying that the media houses or individual journalists are manipulated by the government, that is not true.\u201d Foreign correspondents It is not just local reporters who face obstacles. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation\u2019s South Asia bureau chief Avani Dias recently left the country, as did Vanessa Dougnac, regional correspondent for four French publications. Dias said the government told her that her visa extension would be denied as her reporting had \u201ccrossed a line,\u201d though the government has denied this. It said she was granted an extension the day she paid her visa fees, on 18 April, but decided to leave nonetheless on 20 April. Dougnac, an overseas citizen of India (OCI) who worked in the country for 23 years, left in February. In January, she said, she received a notice from the Ministry of Home Affairs stating that her journalistic activities were \u201cmalicious\u201d and \u201ccritical in a manner that they create a biased negative perception about India.\u201d She applied for her journalistic permit \u2013 as required for OCIs since 2022 \u2013 but was denied. \u201cThey gave no reasons nor any justifications for why they denied my permit,\u201d she told CNN from Paris. India\u2019s Home Ministry did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment about Dougnac\u2019s situation. And in February last year the Indian offices of the BBC were raided by tax authorities, weeks after the broadcaster aired a documentary highly critical of Modi. The documentary, which was described as \u201canti-India garbage\u201d by a senior advisor to the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, was later blocked on social media platforms. Speaking to reporters shortly after the BBC raids, BJP spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia made no reference to the documentary, and said companies, including media agencies, must \u201cfollow and respect Indian law.\u201d The BBC has since split its India operations into separate companies in a bid to meet the country\u2019s foreign investment rules. Dougnac said she was not surprised by the actions against international media. \u201cIt started with local journalists and slowly foreign correspondents got the sense they were next,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is what is happening now.\u201d Despite witnessing what is happening to and around him, Kappan says he has not lost faith in journalism in india. He considers advocating for it a \u201cmoral imperative.\u201d \u201cDespite the personal risks involved, the pursuit of truth remains paramount,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/media/india-elections-press-freedom-decline-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_15_success_best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund", "text": "The average federal tax refund is more than $3,000, according to the latest data from the IRS. Since the majority of tax filers get a refund, there\u2019s a fair chance you could get hundreds if not thousands of dollars back in overpaid taxes, especially if you\u2019re also owed a refund from your state government. That money may feel like a windfall, and it\u2019s easy to squander it on a lot of little things. But if you\u2019re looking to improve your current financial situation, here are seven ideas to consider. Well, technically six, but you\u2019ll enjoy the seventh the most. 1. Pay off high-rate debt If you are carrying a balance on your credit card and are paying 20% to 30% in interest, make this your first priority to pay down. At such sky-high rates, \u201cthe debt can grow faster than you can pay it off,\u201d said Eric Bronnenkant, a certified financial planner and head of tax at Betterment, a robo-advisory financial services firm that also has a human advice team on hand to help clients. Keyana Russ, a certified financial planner at Four Ponds Financial Planning, concurred that people\u2019s awareness of how much money they\u2019re paying in interest over time doesn\u2019t always register. \u201cWhat I usually see is people paying the minimum, or they\u2019re charging everyday expenses and not paying off the bill at the end of the month. \u2026 They don\u2019t understand how much interest they\u2019re paying,\u201d Russ said. For example, if you\u2019re carrying a $3,000 balance at 27% interest and you only pay a required minimum of $97.50 every month, it will take you 240 months (which is 20 years) just to pay off the $3,000 \u2014 and, in addition, you will have paid $3,044.57 in interest, for a total of $6,044.57, according to Bankrate.com\u2019s calculator. 2. Create or add to an emergency fund You can use your refund to start or bolster an emergency fund. When it comes to costly emergencies, there are many Americans who don\u2019t have at least three months\u2019 worth of living expenses set aside, let alone enough to easily handle an unexpected bill of $1,000. Be sure to stash the money in a high-yield savings account at an FDIC-insured bank, Russ suggested, noting that the best interest rates are typically offered by online banks. If you have high-rate debt and you\u2019re lacking emergency savings, Russ suggested you might use a portion of your refund to attack your debt and the other portion to create an emergency fund. Bronnenkant favors paying off the high-rate debt first, but, if you\u2019re low on emergency savings and need a critical repair to help keep your job \u2014 such as on your car \u2014 he said it might make sense to set aside money for that repair and put the rest toward your credit card or other high-rate debt. 3. Make an extra payment on your mortgage If you\u2019re carrying a mortgage at a high rate (e.g., 7% to 8%), and you\u2019re not saddled with credit card debt, you might consider making an extra payment or two. \u201cIt can make a difference in the long run towards your principal,\u201d Russ said.\u00a0 You can even view it as an additional form of savings, in the sense that you\u2019re saving yourself an extra 7% \ufeffor so in interest on the portion of the principal you\u2019re paying down, Bronnenkant noted. 4. Invest in a Roth IRA If your income qualifies you to contribute to a Roth IRA, you can contribute up to $7,000 this year ($8,000 if you\u2019re at least 50) with after-tax savings. That money will grow untaxed until retirement, at which point your withdrawals will be tax-free and penalty-free after age 59-1/2, assuming the account has been open for at least five years. (And note: You can still make a 2023 Roth contribution until April 15 this year. The contribution limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if you\u2019re age 50 or older. Bolstering your tax-free retirement savings is great.\u00a0But if you need to access some of your money well before you retire, you may take out any part of your contributions tax-free and penalty-free at any time, \ufeffBronnenkant said. You would only be taxed and penalized if you withdrew the earnings on your contributions before age 59-1/2. (For more information on Roth IRA withdrawal rules, here is an easy-to-understand rundown from Charles Schwab.) 5. Contribute enough to your 401(k) in 2024 to get your full employer match Speaking of retirement savings, if you\u2019re not yet contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match from your employer, a refund can make that easier. Say you get $3,000 back. You can put that money in a high-yield savings account to earn interest. Then, on your workplace 401(k) site, change your paycheck contribution levels so that by the end of the year you will have contributed $3,000 more in pre-tax money than you otherwise would have. For instance, say you\u2019re paid every two weeks and you have 20 more paychecks left until the end of the year. You can boost you biweekly contributions by $150 per paycheck ($150 x 20 = $3,000). \u201cYou want to get the max match from your employer,\u201d Bronnenkant said. 6. Invest for shorter-term goals If in the next three to 10 years you expect to buy a home, take a once-in-a-lifetime trip, renovate a room, send your kids to summer camp or have any other expensive goal, you might consider investing your refund in a diversified mix of low-cost, broad market index funds. The shorter term your goal is, the less risk you want to take. If you need the money within three years, you might consider putting your refund in certificates of deposits and US Treasury bonds. But if your goal is five to 10 years out, and you\u2019re comfortable taking on some more risk and are willing to accept fluctuations in the market, Bronnenkant said, you might put no more than 30% of your refund in a stock index fund and 70% in a total market bond fund if your risk tolerance is conservative; or 50% in each if you have a moderate risk tolerance. If you plan on sending your child to college and you have a 529 plan, you can use your refund to boost your contributions to that plan, Russ said. You may also get a tax break for your contribution depending on the state where you live. 7. Have some fun Unless you\u2019re in truly dire financial straits, if you get a large refund, you might set aside a small portion to do whatever you truly enjoy. \u201cSometimes you just want to have fun and not have it be all business,\u201d Russ said. \u201cYou can set aside some of the money to have fun.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/15/success/best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_05_22_business_scarlett-johansson-open-ai-nightcap", "text": "If you\u2019ve been snoozing through the Scarlett Johansson-OpenAI drama this week, let me quickly catch you up quickly: A woman rejected a man\u2019s request, twice, and he responded like a child \u2014 demonstrating just one of the reasons the world needs to be skeptical of the people and companies profiting from their own breathless AI hype. Bear with me for the slightly longer version. Back in September, Scarlett Johansson, who played the hauntingly complex AI assistant in the 2013 Spike Jonze film \u201cHer,\u201d got a request from OpenAI\u2019s CEO, Sam Altman. He wanted to hire Johansson to voice his company\u2019s newest ChatGPT model, \u201cSky.\u201d She said no. Several months later, just days before the product launched, he asked her to reconsider. But before she had a chance to say no a second time, OpenAI released the new model with a voice that sounded strikingly similar to Johansson\u2019s. The AI\u2019s debut was both mind-blowing and cringe-y. Mind-blowing because of the bot\u2019s apparent sophistication and human-like qualities, and cringe-worthy given how uncomfortably flirty it sounded, like a caricature of a computer developer\u2019s fantasy. Johansson quickly lawyered up, saying Monday she was \u201cshocked, angered and in disbelief\u201d that Altman would use a voice \u201cso eerily similar\u201d to her own. The company, which hit pause on the update after the legal threat from Johansson, said the voice \u201cbelongs to a different professional actress using her own natural speaking voice\u201d and was not intended to resemble Johansson\u2019s. Altman \u2014 who is on the record about his love of the Spike Jonze film, and even tweeted the word \u201cher\u201d on the day of the launch \u2014 apologized to Johansson on Monday. Safety takes a backseat The rift reflects a broader anxiety among artists, academics and even some AI pioneers over the speed at which tech companies are building and releasing AI tools to the public, with seemingly little regard for intellectual property and safety concerns. It also points to one of the original sins of AI that its developers have yet to resolve: that all of these products are being greenlit, funded and built by the 0.01% of Silicon Valley \u2014 a largely young, white and male cohort, whose natural human biases are getting baked in to the AI in ways that even they don\u2019t fully understand, or are aware of. OpenAI was forced to confront some of those concerns late last week, after two prominent employees left the company. One, Jan Leike, wrote on X that the company\u2019s \u201csafety culture and processes have taken a backseat to shiny products.\u201d The other, OpenAI\u2019s co-founder and chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, announced he was\u00a0leaving to work on another project, without disclosing details, though his departure is especially notable given his key role in (briefly, dramatically) firing Altman last year over concerns that Altman was pushing AI technology \u201ctoo far, too fast.\u201d Altman even acknowledged Leike\u2019s point, saying: \u201cHe\u2019s right we have a lot more to do; we are committed to doing it.\u201d  That\u2019s the kind of diplomatic candor that\u2019s helped make Altman, a 39-year-old billionaire, the face of \u201cresponsible AI.\u201d He is a thoughtful, charismatic figure, and he really wants us to trust that he\u2019s looking out for the regular folks as he mints money and races to beat Google and Meta to the AI mountaintop. I\u2019d be curious to ask him, though, when was the last time he watched \u201cHer\u201d \u2014 one of his favorite movies that he called \u201cincredibly prophetic\u201d \u2014 all the way to the end. Because part of what makes the film great is how Johansson\u2019s warm and empathetic voice lulls the main character (and the audience, ultimately) into an almost hypnotic state of infatuation. Maybe the ease of human-AI companionship is acceptable, or even preferable, to the messy realities of real love, we wonder as we watch Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s character walk alone on a crowded beach, the camera of his phone peeking out of his shirt pocket, smiling because he\u2019s so happy with his AI lover. Of course, by the end of the movie, the AI\u2019s have decamped to some other plane of existence, leaving the humans, with all their messy human needs, to take care of one another once again. \u201cBeing friends with AI will be so much easier than forging bonds with human beings,\u201d wrote Wired editor Brian Barrett in a recent essay about the movie. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s better. Sometimes it\u2019s much worse.\u201d \u2014CNN\u2019s Clare Duffy and Brian Fung contributed reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/business/scarlett-johansson-open-ai-nightcap/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_tech_microsoft-ai-tool-privacy-recall", "text": "Microsoft\u2019s buzziest new AI feature is raising concerns that it could potentially be misused in the wrong hands. This week, the company showed off a new tool called Recall for Windows computers that acts as a personal \u201ctime machine,\u201d allowing users to quickly pull up anything that\u2019s ever been on screen, such as documents, images and websites. It\u2019s different from a keyword search; the tool regularly saves screenshots of the user\u2019s screen and stores them directly on the device. It then uses AI to process the data and make it searchable. For example, if someone previously searched for a green dress or the name of a local ice cream shop, they can ask the feature to \u201crecall\u201d anything in their history that was shown on screen. Although so-called semantic search is a big step forward for AI, it comes at a time when the industry is moving so quickly and government regulators, companies and consumers are still figuring out how to use the technology responsibly. Jen Golbeck \u2013 a professor of AI at the University of Maryland who focuses on privacy\u00a0\u2013 said the recall feature could pose a potential \u201cnightmare\u201d if the device falls into the wrong hands. \u201cStuff may stay on your device, but that doesn\u2019t mean people can\u2019t get to it,\u201d she said. \u201cYou won\u2019t have an option to protect yourself even if you use incognito mode or clear your history because the tool has access to everything that\u2019s been on your screen.\u201d The UK\u2019s independent regulator for Data Protection and Freedom of Information, the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO), told CNN it is investigating the tool \u201cto understand the safeguards in place to protect user privacy.\u201d \u201cWe expect organisations to be transparent with users about how their data is being used and only process personal data to the extent that it is necessary to achieve a specific purpose,\u201d the ICO said in a statement. Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment. CEO Satya Nadella told The Wall Street Journal in an interview ahead of Monday\u2019s launch that web searches must only be done on Microsoft\u2019s Edge web browser and that the screenshots never leave the user\u2019s computer. \u201cYou have to put two things together: This is my computer and this is my Recall \u2013 and it\u2019s all being done locally,\u201d he said. Geoff Blaber, CEO of market research firm CCS Insight, said that makes the issue less concerning. \u201cThe backlash by some to this feature isn\u2019t surprising, but it\u2019s an overreaction given that the data stays exclusively on the device and the user has full control,\u201d Blaber said. Someone can decide whether to turn the feature on during the device setup process and can customize and blacklist which apps and websites Recall can access. \u201cThese controls suggest the feature has been built with security and privacy at its core,\u201d he said. \u201cRecall won\u2019t appeal to everyone but the utility provided is likely to be significant.\u201d Potential for malicious uses But Golbeck cited times when that protection might not be enough, such as a journalist in a hostile country, a person trying to get out of an abusive relationship, someone searching for sensitive medical information or an employee whose boss wants to track them. She believes issues around the tool will likely impact the workplace the most. \u201cWe know jobs monitor what we\u2019re doing on their devices, but a lot of people will do a personal thing on their work computer and all of that will be archived and visible to an IT department, even if it just stays on device,\u201d she added. Golbeck said technology, despite the benefits, is too often developed without the consideration of malicious uses. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen over the last 15 years is every single one of those potential malicious use cases comes to fruition in some way or another,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople will want to use this cool feature without understanding the privacy risk \u2013 that there will be a permanent record of everything you do.\u201d Similar reactions to features such as biometric passwords, such as fingerprints, facial recognition and iris scans, have emerged in the past. Blaber said to overcome some of the initial concerns, Microsoft and its partners will need to prove the value, security and privacy of the product in the real world. Still, Michela Menting, a senior research director at ABI Research, believes the feature is a \u201cstep backwards\u201d for privacy. \u201cThe argument that hackers need physical access to even be able to manipulate Recall is short-sighted at best because there are plenty of highly ingenious ways threat actors could exploit such a valuable tool,\u201d she said. \u201cAll it takes is time and effort to find a way.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/tech/microsoft-ai-tool-privacy-recall/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_20_success_interest-rates-savings-cash", "text": "The Federal Reserve\u2019s benchmark interest rate remains at a 23-year high. That\u2019s thanks to the central bank\u2019s decision Wednesday to once again hold it steady, as it has done at the policy-making committee\u2019s past five meetings. That decision may be disappointing to some investors, homebuyers and those with a lot of credit card debt, since movement in the Fed\u2019s overnight lending rate influences rates \u2014 directly or indirectly \u2014 on consumer financial products (e.g., credit cards, bank loans and mortgages). But\u00a0with the Fed signaling that no rate cuts are likely until summer, it also means anyone with savings still has at least a few more months to make hay of their stash. That\u2019s because you can still get inflation-beating interest rates that will grow any money you have set aside for emergencies, vacations, down payments or any other goal in your sights over the next several years. However, that won\u2019t happen if you just let it sit in a traditional checking or savings account that yields next to nothing. There are more lucrative, low-risk options out there, with rates that are still at or near their peaks. \u201cBut perhaps not for much longer,\u201d said Ted Rossman, senior analyst at Bankrate. \u201cIf one of those fits into your financial plans, it\u2019s best to act soon.\u201d So, consider the following options when deciding where to park your hard-earned savings. High-yield online savings accounts The average annual percentage yield on bank savings accounts was just 0.52% as of March 13, according to Bankrate. That average is kept low by the biggest brick-and-mortar banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, which still are offering a paltry 0.01%. By contrast, there are still FDIC-insured online banks offering inflation-beating rates of between 4.35% and 5.35% on their high-yield savings accounts. Generally speaking, these are the best vehicles in which to keep your emergency funds for quick, easy access. Choosing between an account that pays 0.52% and one that pays 5.35% can mean forfeiting hundreds of dollars in interest. \u201cIf you put $10,000 in a savings account, that\u2019s a difference of $496 in interest earnings over the course of the year, assuming monthly compounding,\u201d Rossman said. While the rates on high-yield savings accounts have gone down a bit in recent months, \u201cwidespread cuts in online savings account rates are unlikely until the first Fed rate cut is near,\u201d said Ken Tumin, founder of DepositAccounts.com. As with any bank savings rate, high-yield savings account\u00a0rates\u00a0can change overnight, and the bank may not alert you when it lowers it. So make sure to check your monthly statement. Certificates of deposits Another high-return, low-risk investment that is great for money you likely won\u2019t need to tap for a few months or even a couple of years is a certificate of deposit. You can get the best returns on CDs through a brokerage such as Schwab, E*Trade or Fidelity. That\u2019s because you can comparison shop for CDs from any number of FDIC-insured banks and will not have to set up individual accounts with each institution. As of March 13, the average rate on a one-year CD was 1.95%, but some banks are offering as much are 5.4%. If you can get a one-year CD at, say, 5.4%, you will make $540 on a $10,000 investment. To get the greatest benefit from a CD, you have to leave the money invested for a fixed period. You can always access your principal sooner if you need to, but there may be early withdrawal penalties. As of March 20, CDs listed on Schwab.com with durations from three months up to three years were all yielding between 5.2% and 5.51%. CD rates on durations between four and 10 years ranged from 4.40% to 5.15%. Say you invest $10,000 in a one-year CD with a 5.36%\u00a0APY. At the end of that period, you\u2019d get your principal back plus $536 in interest when the CD matures, according to Bankrate\u2019s CD calculator. If you chose a two-year CD at 5.25%, you\u2019d bank an extra $1,078, assuming compounding interest. The same investment in a five-year CD at 5.15% would earn $2,854. \u201cIt makes sense to go long with CDs. To hedge your bets, include terms from one to five years. Starting a CD ladder will provide this mix,\u201d Tumin said. If you don\u2019t go through a brokerage you may get a reasonable deal from your primary bank, Tumin said. For example, he noted, Wells Fargo is still offering up to 5.01% on both 4-month and 7-month CDs. Or, at Bank of America, you can get up to 4.75% on a 7-month CD. But Tumin cautions that with any big bank CD you should take your money out at the end of the term, otherwise your bank may automatically renew it and lock you in to a much lower-yielding CD. Money market accounts and funds If you don\u2019t want to set up an online savings account at another bank, your own bank may offer you a money market deposit account that pays a higher yield than your regular checking or savings accounts. Money market accounts may have higher minimum deposit requirements than a regular savings account, but they are more liquid than a fixed-term certificate of deposit or Treasury bill, meaning they give you access to your money more quickly while still potentially giving you some of the highest yields available, said Doug Ornstein, senior manager for integrated solutions at TIAA Wealth Management. But don\u2019t confuse money market accounts with money market mutual funds, which invest in short-term, low-risk debt instruments. As of March 19, they had an average 7-day yield of 5.14%, according to the Crane Money Fund Index, which tracks the top 100 taxable money market funds. Unlike money market deposit accounts, money market mutual funds are not insured by the FDIC. But if you invest in a money market fund through a brokerage, your overall account is likely to be insured through the Securities Investor Protection Corp, which offers protection in the event your brokerage ever goes under. Treasury bills and notes Another option for money you can leave untouched anywhere from several months to a few years is to buy short-term Treasury bills and medium-term notes, which are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. Three- and six-month bills had yields of 5.39% and 5.33%\u00a0respectively on March 20 before the Fed\u2019s meeting ended, while nine-month and one-year bills were offering 5.19% and 5.08%\u00a0respectively, according to rates posted on Schwab.com for a $25,000 investment. Rates on Treasury notes with durations from two years to 10 years ranged between 4.29% and 4.72%. If you\u2019re someone who manages your portfolio like a hawk, you may feel comfortable buying T-bills on your own from TreasuryDirect.gov. But if you don\u2019t, it might be easier just to buy new issues through your brokerage account or invest in a short-term bond index fund or ETF, said Andy Smith, executive director of financial planning at Edelman Financial Engines. And if you\u2019re looking at money that will be needed in three to five years, you might consider a diversified fund of highly rated government and corporate bonds, Ornstein said. An 18-month AAA-rated corporate bond, for instance, was yielding 4.82% this week, while the three-year was at 4.49%. Meanwhile, three-year AAA-rated municipal bonds (which are issued by local governments) had a rate of 3.98%, according to Schwab.com. Don\u2019t chase yield When deciding on the best accounts and investments for your specific goals and peace of mind, it may pay to consult a fee-only fiduciary adviser \u2014 meaning, someone who doesn\u2019t get paid a commission to sell you a particular investment. What you\u2019ll always want to do is build in flexibility for yourself so you can easily access cash, regardless of your timeline for key goals. \u201cWhat happens if something changes and you need that down payment a lot sooner \u2014 or your parents need medical care fast?\u201d Smith said. That means balancing your desire for great yield with a need and desire for ease of access without penalty. Translation: Don\u2019t chase yield for yield\u2019s sake. Think of it this way, Ornstein said: Unless you have huge sums to invest or are an institutional investor, the difference between getting a 5.1% yield versus 5% is negligible, and in fact it could even cost you more if there are penalties for taking your money out early. \u201cMost of the time convenience is really important.

{"id": "2024_05_17_tech_voice-actors-ai-lawsuit-lovo", "text": "Voice actor Paul Skye Lehrman took a job in 2020 for which he believed he was providing a set of one-off voice samples. Years later, he says he heard his voice narrating a YouTube video and then on a podcast \u2014 even though he had never recorded either of them. Now, Lehrman, along with fellow voice actor Linnea Sage, is suing AI firm Lovo for allegedly commissioning them for voice projects under false pretenses in order to create and sell AI-generated versions of their voices. The Berkeley, California based tech company advertises AI-generated voice technology to be used in marketing, education and product demos. Lehrman and Sage are suing Lovo and seeking class action status to include other people \u201cwhose voices and/or identities were stolen and used,\u201d according to the complaint filed Thursday in the Southern District Court of New York. The complaint was first reported by the New York Times. The voice actors\u2019 lawsuit is just the latest in a recent string of legal actions brought against various tech companies by creatives, writers and artists who say their work was used without their permission to train AI systems that could ultimately compete with them. Such lawsuits have added to a growing wave of concerns over how the training of AI models, which requires huge swaths of data, could run afoul of copyright and intellectual property laws. \u201cImplicit in LOVO\u2019s offerings to its customers is that each voice-over actor has agreed to LOVO\u2019s terms and conditions for customers to be able to access that actor\u2019s voice,\u201d the complaint states. But for Lehrman and Sage and any others \u201cwho have not agreed to LOVO\u2019s terms, the continued unauthorized use of Plaintiffs\u2019 voices is theft of service and misappropriation.\u201d Lovo did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit. In May 2020, Lehrman says he received a request for voice-over narrative services on the gig work website Fiverr from an account called \u201cUser25199087.\u201d When he asked what the voice sample was for, he was told it would be used \u201cfor academic research purposes only\u201d and that \u201cthe scripts would not be used for anything else,\u201d according to the complaint. He was paid $1,200 for the job, the complaint states. Two years later, Lehrman came across a YouTube video that sounded as if it had his voice narrating it, although he\u2019d never been involved in its creation, the complaint states. Then in June 2023, Lehrman claims he heard his voice being used on a podcast about the dangers of AI technologies. Similarly, Sage was offered a job on Fiverr in 2019 producing \u201ctest scripts for radio ads\u201d that she was told would \u201cnot be disclosed externally,\u201d according to the complaint. She was paid $400. Sage says she later also discovered her voice in a YouTube video: a recording of a Lovo investor presentation demonstrating its technology. Lehrman and Sage allege that the people who contacted them on Fiverr were Lovo employees who misrepresented what their voice samples would be used for and later sold or raised money on the back of the AI-version of their voices. \u201cTo be clear, the product that customers purchase from LOVO is stolen property. They are voices stolen by LOVO and marketed by LOVO under false pretenses,\u201d the complaint states. The actors are seeking more than $5 million in damages, as well as a court order blocking Lovo from continuing the alleged use of their voices.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/tech/voice-actors-ai-lawsuit-lovo/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk", "text": "In a year of wild tech stories that has seen Elon Musk transform Twitter, cryptocurrency exchange FTX collapse and Silicon Valley Bank implode, this week\u2019s whiplash-inducing turmoil at OpenAI is among the most captivating. Sam Altman \u2014 the leader of one of the world\u2019s most influential AI companies, OpenAI, and perhaps the\u00a0most visible figure in the fledgling industry \u2014 was fired Friday night by the startup\u2019s directors in a surprise move. Less than five days later, he\u2019s back as the company\u2019s CEO, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. The series of extraordinary events unfolded just days after OpenAI held its\u00a0first-ever developer conference, where it laid out new, commercialized versions of its technology, including the option to customize its ChatGPT AI chatbot. If you\u2019re just catching up, here\u2019s what you missed from a week so incredible you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking the script could have been written by an early version of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Friday Around 3 p.m. ET, Altman joined a Google Meet call with most of OpenAI\u2019s board that had been convened by fellow co-founder and OpenAI chief scientist\u00a0Ilya Sutskever, during which Altman was fired and told that the news would soon be made public. Within the next half hour, the board also informed Greg Brockman, another co-founder and OpenAI president, that he would be removed from the board. Around 3:30 p.m. ET, OpenAI publicly announced that it had fired Altman over concerns that he was not always truthful with the board. The board said Mira Murati, the company\u2019s chief technology officer, would become interim CEO. OpenAI\u2019s strategic partners, including its biggest financial backer Microsoft, were also reportedly informed of Altman\u2019s ouster just minutes before the board\u2019s announcement. Hours after being fired, Altman posted on X that he \u201cloved working with such talented people\u201d and that he would have \u201cmore to say about what\u2019s next later.\u201d Brockman promptly quit. \u201cPlease don\u2019t spend any time being concerned. We will be fine,\u201d Brockman\u00a0said in a Friday post\u00a0on X. \u201cGreater things coming soon.\u201d A key factor in the CEO\u2019s firing was\u00a0tension between Altman, who favored developing AI\u00a0more aggressively, and members of the OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the unfolding events. Saturday Within 24 hours of Altman being fired, reports emerged that he and other ex-OpenAI loyalists were mulling plans for their own venture. OpenAI\u2019s board was also reportedly having second thoughts and considering asking the ousted CEO to return. Sunday By Sunday afternoon, Altman was\u00a0back at OpenAI\u2019s headquarters\u00a0\u2014 this time with a guest badge \u2014 to negotiate his potential return. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reportedly mediated the discussion. A 5 p.m. PT deadline was reportedly set for the board to agree to Altman\u2019s demands, including adding a seat for Microsoft, and reinstating him as CEO. But those talks broke down. As Sunday turned into Monday, Nadella tweeted that Altman, along with Brockman, would join Microsoft to run a new AI research group. At OpenAI, the group found a new interim CEO: Emmett Shear, the former CEO of Amazon\u2019s streaming service, Twitch. Murati would return to her role as OpenAI\u2019s chief technology officer. Monday In a post on X early Monday, Shear, who left his role at Twitch in March, described the chance to join OpenAI as \u201ca once-in-a-lifetime\u201d opportunity. He added that the company would hire an independent investigator to report on what happened in the lead-up to Altman\u2019s firing. But OpenAI employees were not convinced. More than 500 staffers signed an open letter calling on the company\u2019s board to resign and reinstate Altman and Brockman. They also threatened to follow the co-founders to Microsoft if their demands were not met. Altman posted on X, saying, \u201cwe have more unity and commitment and focus than ever before. we are all going to work together some way or other, and i\u2019m so excited. one team, one mission.\u201d The drama was far from over.\u00a0The Verge reported Monday afternoon\u00a0that Altman and Brockman could still return to OpenAI if the board members who fired him resign. And Nadella, speaking to CNBC, said he was \u201copen to both options\u201d when asked whether Altman would actually join Microsoft. \u201cLook, that is for the OpenAI board and management and the employees to choose,\u201d Nadella said. \u201cWe chose to explicitly partner with OpenAI and we want to continue to do so, and obviously, that depends on the people of OpenAI staying there or coming to Microsoft.\u201d Tuesday Altman\u00a0was reinstated late Tuesday as OpenAI\u2019s CEO, the company said on X. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman\u00a0wrote\u00a0that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his\u00a0post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it has backed with billions to bolster its ambitions in developing AI. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Nadella\u00a0said\u00a0on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "business"}}

The company plans to spin off its electronics and water businesses into their own yet-to-be-named companies in a transaction that is tax-free to shareholders. DuPont said it expects to complete the breakup transactions within the next 18 to 24 months, and it is subject to final approval by DuPont\u2019s board of directors. The announcement also included a shakeup in leadership: Effective June 1, DuPont\u2019s chief financial officer, Lori Koch, will step into the CEO role. DuPont\u2019s current CEO, Ed Breen, will stay on as executive chairman. Koch will remain CEO of the new, slimmed-down DuPont once the spin-offs are complete, according to the company. DuPont\u2019s breakup comes amid other large, multi-national companies announcing breakups in recent years, with many CEOs and corporate boards touting the agility of smaller companies. In a statement, Breen echoed a similar refrain, saying the three smaller companies would have greater flexibility after the spin-off. \u201cThe three-way separation will unlock incremental value for shareholders and customers and also create new opportunities for employees,\u201d he said. \u201cCritically, each company will have greater flexibility to pursue their own focused growth strategies, including portfolio enhancing M&A (mergers and acquisitions).\u201d In the last several years, major American companies like J&J, Kellogg and General Electric announced company break-ups and spin-offs, signaling a preference for smaller, more nimble companies over the conglomerates that gained prominence in previous decades.

On Wednesday, DuPont said the newly formed electronics company would focus on \u201csemiconductor solutions and advanced electronics products,\u201d while the new water company would be \u201ca comprehensive water solutions provider.\u201d The leftover divisions will remain as part of DuPont.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/business/dupont-de-nemours-company-split/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_05_22_investing_opec-exxon-investigation", "text": "Congressional Democrats are investigating whether leading US oil companies have illegally colluded with one another and with OPEC to inflate prices at the pump, CNN has learned. Rep. Frank Pallone Jr., the ranking member of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, sent a letter Tuesday night to ExxonMobil, Chevron, Hess, BP America and three other fossil fuel companies demanding a trove of documents and communications. \u201cIf US oil companies are colluding with each other and foreign cartels to manipulate global oil markets and harm American consumers who then pay more at the pump, Congress and the American people deserve to know,\u201d Pallone, a New Jersey Democrat, wrote in a letter to oil CEOs. The companies have until June 5 to respond to the committee. The investigation comes after a\u00a0stunning accusation from federal regulators\u00a0against Scott Sheffield, the longtime CEO of a leading Texas producer. The Federal Trade Commission earlier this month accused Sheffield, the founder of Pioneer Natural Resources, of conspiring with OPEC and its allies to boost prices. The FTC said Sheffield\u00a0sent hundreds of text messages, had multiple WhatsApp conversations\u00a0and\u00a0in-person meetings,\u00a0and\u00a0made\u00a0public statements to try to \u201calign oil production\u201d in the Permian Basin in Texas with that of OPEC and OPEC+, a wider producer group that includes Russia. \u201cI am concerned that Mr. Sheffield\u2019s behavior may represent common practices across the industry,\u201d Pallone wrote. \u201cEven more troubling, Mr. Sheffield appears to have attempted to encourage other US oil producers to follow his and Pioneer\u2019s lead in colluding with a cartel to drive up energy costs at Americans expense.\u201d OPEC vs. the free market Although OPEC and OPEC+ exist to coordinate production among members, US oil production is supposed to be decided by the free market. Oil CEOs are not allowed to decide whether to raise or lower production because such conduct is\u00a0prohibited by federal law, which bans price fixing and actions that might restrict competition. \u201cOPEC and OPEC+ have not been able to impose long-term devastating costs upon American consumers in recent years because oil producers here have become the crude oil market\u2019s \u2018swing producers\u2019 and must adhere to the antitrust and competition laws of the United States,\u201d Pallone wrote. \u201cWithout those protections, American consumers would be at the mercy of OPEC and OPEC+ member nations, including Russia.\u201d In addition to Exxon, Chevron, BP America and Hess, the investigation is targeting Shell USA, Occidental and Devon Energy. CNN has reached out to the companies targeted in the investigation for comment. Pallone argued that public data suggests US oil producers did not ramp up drilling during the period that Sheffield was trying to influence his rivals. Pallone is demanding the oil companies turn over a series of documents, including: all communications between each company\u2019s employees involved in production and representatives of OPEC or OPEC+; a list of meetings between each company and representatives of the oil cartels; all communications between each company and representatives of competitors that \u201cdescribe or allude to\u201d production; nonpublic communications or meetings executives had with shareholders on oil production; and a description of efforts to influence federal or state governments to \u201cartificially limit\u201d oil production. Pallone sent Exxon additional document demands, including communications between Pioneer employees who were involved in developing production plans and representatives of OPEC and OPEC+. Sheffield barred from Exxon Earlier this month, the FTC gave the green light\u00a0for Pioneer to be sold to ExxonMobil for $60 billion\u00a0\u2014 but only under an agreement that prevents Sheffield from sitting on Exxon\u2019s board or serving as an adviser. Sheffield was among the oil CEOs who testified before Pallone\u2019s committee during an April\u00a02022 hearing on Big Oil\u00a0and gas prices. Exxon said it learned of the allegations against Sheffield from the FTC and said the behavior described is \u201centirely inconsistent with how we do business.\u201d Pioneer released a statement earlier this month defending Sheffield and arguing it was \u201cneither the intent nor an effect of his communications to circumvent the laws and principles protecting market competition.\u201d Pioneer said it disagreed with and was \u201csurprised\u201d by the FTC\u2019s complaint, saying it \u201creflects a fundamental misunderstanding\u201d of oil markets and \u201cmisreads the nature and intents of Mr. Sheffield\u2019s actions.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/investing/opec-exxon-investigation/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_27_media_nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over", "text": "Only 80 hours elapsed between NBC News announcing Ronna McDaniel as a paid contributor and the network ousting her from that very role. But for the leadership at NBC Universal News Group, those were 80\u00a0painful hours. On Tuesday evening, following another full day in which the media rumor mill churned at warp speed, NBCU News Group boss Cesar Conde sent staff a memo, notifying his troops that he had reversed his decision to welcome the former Republican National Committee chair to \u201cthe team.\u201d \u201cAfter listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor,\u201d Conde said, adding that he wanted to \u201cpersonally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down.\u201d Conde had no real choice. The embattled NBCU boss, who I\u2019m told dealt with the crisis from an unknown location outside of 30 Rock, was facing an unprecedented rebellion from his most high-profile stars, who one by one went on the air and excoriated leadership\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel. The only aspect of Conde\u2019s note that was surprising was the fact that it came 48 hours late, allowing what started off as a crisis to fester and balloon into one of the worst corporate public relations calamities in recent memory. \u201cWhat a sh*t show!\u201d a media executive exclaimed to me Tuesday shortly after Conde relieved McDaniel of her NBC News credentials. In his note, Conde said he took \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for McDaniel\u2019s hire. But, he also did point the finger, telling staffers that hiring her was \u201ca collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team.\u201d Indeed, multiple people familiar with the matter have told me that the infighting among NBC executives over who was at fault for the disaster has reached a fever pitch, with various factions of the NBCU News Group assigning blame to others. Regardless of who is to blame, the entire affair made clear who is actually in control of the company \u2014 and it\u2019s not Conde & Co. Despite the NBCU C-suite digging their heels in the sand as they resisted dumping McDaniel for days, they were ultimately forced to succumb to pressure from their talent. As a second media executive commented to me, it is now \u201cvery clear who is in charge\u201d after the \u201cweak leadership was put on full display.\u201d \u201cHas Cesar lost the room?\u201d wondered a third media executive. While the Peacock family argues over who was really at fault, the company is facing a fresh public relations mess. Led by Donald Trump, right-wing personalities are already assailing the network as being overrun with intolerant woke leftists. \u201cThese Radical Left Lunatics are CRAZY and the top people at NBC ARE WEAK,\u201d Trump raged on his Truth Social platform. Ari Fleischer, who served as press secretary under President George W. Bush, wrote on X: \u201cWhat NBC is saying is if you\u2019re for Trump, you don\u2019t belong. Good. Let NBC be for Democrats only.\u201d Of course, that narrative is intellectually dishonest. The objection to McDaniel from both within and outside of NBCU was not that she is a Republican. It wasn\u2019t even that she was a Trump-supporting Republican. No, the objection stemmed from the fact that McDaniel was an active participant in the plot to subvert the 2020 vote. And, in addition to that disgraceful history, she had a lengthy track record smearing NBC News and MSNBC. Nevertheless, NBCU will now have to contend with such dishonest attacks being leveled by the right, which will follow them in the days, months, and even years to come. As unfair as it may be, they will certainly damage the network\u2019s brand in Republican circles \u2014 a place it had gone through great pains to appeal to. NBCU will also have to grapple with McDaniel, who spent the last 24 hours or so interviewing lawyers as she gears up for a possible legal fight with the network, according to a person familiar with the matter. The rift between McDaniel and NBCU had grown to such an extent by Tuesday that she was not informed by network brass that she had been dismissed, I\u2019m told. Instead, McDaniel learned of her ouster in press reports. While NBCU is being beaten up on the right, the company\u2019s leadership was quickly praised by its journalists and top stars. Shortly after Conde sent out his memo, Rachel Maddow appeared on Joy Reid\u2019s show, where the two lauded Conde for reversing course. \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/27/media/nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_business_nvidias-stock-split-earnings-results", "text": "Nvidia announced a 10-for-1 stock split on Wednesday, making buying shares in the red-hot semiconductor company more accessible for individual investors. Five years ago, an investor could have purchased Nvidia stock for less than $50 a share. But since then, the stock has exploded more than 2,500%. A single share in the company was worth $949.50 as of Wednesday\u2019s close. Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) announcement, which came in its quarterly earnings report, means that each common share will be split into 10 smaller shares, effectively cutting the price of investing in the company. The company posted yet another quarter of strong financial results on Wednesday, as well. Nvidia reported a 262% increase in revenue and a 462% increase in profits year-over-year. Nvidia\u2019s post-split shares will begin trading at the market open on June 10, coming at a time when Nvidia\u2019s stock has been on a tear, fueled by investor enthusiasm about the company\u2019s role in artificial intelligence. Nvidia shares rose as much as 4% in after-hours trading following the report. Nvidia is crucial to the burgeoning AI space. The American chipmaker is unmatched in producing processors that power artificial intelligence systems, including for generative AI, the buzzy new technology that can create text, images and other media.  And the company\u2019s soaring stock price over the past year means Nvidia is now deeply important to the broader market, too. The company has become something of a bellwether for the larger AI boom that has been driving the recent market rally. That the company was again able to exceed Wall Street\u2019s predications for its booming sales growth on Wednesday isn\u2019t entirely surprising. Many of the major tech giants, including Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet and others, have announced in recent weeks that they\u2019re continuing to pour billions of dollars into building AI infrastructure, and no company is better poised to be the beneficiary of that investment than Nvidia. Still, some investors had raised questions ahead of Wednesday\u2019s report about just how long Nvidia could keep the rally going.

Barnes has maxed out seven credit cards and is struggling to make minimum payments on $30,000 of credit card debt. \u201cThe interest is so high that it\u2019s hard to get out of it,\u201d Barnes, who is 28 years old and lives in Jackson, Mississippi, told CNN in a phone interview on Thursday. Barnes is hardly alone. Roughly one in seven (15.3%) Gen Z credit card borrowers have maxed out their credit cards, according to\u00a0new research\u00a0from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. (The NY Fed defined Gen Z as borrowers born between 1995 and 2011, though\u00a0others mark the cut off\u00a0as 1996 or 1997). By comparison, just 4.8% of Baby Boomer borrowers and 9.6% of Gen Xers have maxed out their credit cards, which can be a sign of a severely tight cash-flow problem. The findings underscore starkly different conditions masked by national economic statistics. Barnes blames bad financial decisions when she was in college for her current situation, which has forced her to live at home and delay major life events. \u201cI want children. The clock is ticking. But I can\u2019t afford to have any children,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve had to go to therapy because it is a lot mentally.\u201d More and more Americans of all ages are falling behind on their bills \u2014 especially credit card bills. The NY Fed found that for all debt outside of student loans, delinquency rates have been steadily rising since tumbling to historic lows during the Covid-19 pandemic. Credit card delinquencies have surpassed pre-pandemic levels and continue to rise. Severe credit card delinquencies, those 90 days overdue, have now climbed to 10.7% \u2014 the highest since 2012. The findings show how pockets of financial stress continue to emerge in the US economy following three years of high inflation. \u201cIt is worrisome that so many Gen Zers are falling behind,\u201d said Ted Rossman, senior industry analyst at Bankrate.com. \u201dWe\u2019re seeing more people financing daily essentials such as groceries and gas, and this can be a tough cycle to break.\u201d \u2018Cause for concern\u2019 Even as stocks on Wall Street hit historic highs and unemployment remains unusually low, millions of Americans are struggling with the cost of living. \u201cThe rise in severe delinquencies \u2014 those over 90 days overdue \u2014 is a cause for concern,\u201d said Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY. The NY Fed found there is a direct link between maxing out credit cards and falling behind on payments. Very few Americans who have used 20% or less of their credit card limit have fallen behind on their bills, according to the research. However, the transition rate into delinquency for those who have used more than 60% of their credit card limit has now surpassed pre-Covid levels and continues to rise, the NY Fed said. A third of maxed-out borrowers are delinquent The researchers said this trend is \u201cespecially remarkable\u201d for those who have maxed out their cards, defined as using 90% to 100% of their limit. A third of maxed-out borrowers have gone delinquent in the last year, compared with less than a quarter before the pandemic, the NY Fed said. \u201cWhile most commentators discuss a soft landing for\u00a0the\u00a0economy or\u00a0the\u00a0consumer,\u201d Daco said, \u201cthe latest evidence on credit conditions points to multiple economies, multiple consumers, affected to different degrees by the higher cost and higher interest rate environment.\u201d Maxing out credit cards can hurt borrowers\u2019 credit scores. Under FICO Score\u2019s calculation, the ratio of balance-to-credit limit is the second most important category for determining credit scores. \u201cFICO will be closely monitoring this trend in the coming quarters to better understand whether this is simply a reversion to pre-pandemic consumer behaviors,\u201d Tommy Lee, senior director at FICO, told CNN in an email. The NY Fed explained that part of the reason Gen Z borrowers are maxed out is because they have much lower credit limits. Many younger Americans haven\u2019t had the time to build credit histories and credit scores that would let them borrow more. For instance, the median Gen Z borrower\u2019s credit limit is just $4,500, compared with $16,300 for Millennials and $21,800 for Gen X, the NY Fed said. The NY Fed declined to share historical data on maxed out credit cards by generation. During a call with reporters, NY Fed researchers explained that it\u2019s a \u201ctypical age pattern\u201d where younger borrowers have used up more of their credit card limit. Lee, the FICO executive, said history shows that as consumers age and their credit experience increases, so do their credit limits. Americans in low-income areas are more likely to be maxed out Of course, it\u2019s not just younger users maxing out their credit cards. The NY Fed found that borrowers who live in low-income areas are also more likely to be maxed out. About 12% of borrowers living in neighborhoods with the bottom 25% of incomes have maxed out their cards, the report found. That\u2019s more than twice the 5.5% of borrowers living in the highest income neighborhoods who are maxed out. There\u2019s never a good time to carry a credit card balance, but right now is arguably the worst time. The average credit card interest rate stands at 20.66%, according to Bankrate. That\u2019s just shy of the record high of 20.75% set last month. Daco said officials at the Federal Reserve must take into account the credit card stress some Americans are feeling as they decide when to lower interest rates. The Fed faces a delicate balance. Cutting rates prematurely could make inflation worse. But waiting too long could pile even more pressure on borrowers, especially if the jobs market slows and more people struggle to find work. \u201cThe risk of over-tightening could lead to unintended consequences that further strain household finances,\u201d Daco said. Ways to get out of debt Experts say there are possible solutions for people who feel trapped by credit card debt. Rossman, the Bankrate analyst, said options include: \u201cI know it\u2019s easier said than done,\u201d Rossman said, \u201cbut it\u2019s so important to make credit card debt payoff a priority.\u201d CNN\u2019s Alicia Wallace contributed reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/business/gen-z-credit-card-users/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2022_04_25_business_electric-hybrid-corvette", "text": "General Motors will produce a fully electric Chevrolet Corvette, GM President Mark Reuss announced in a LinkedIn post Monday morning.  Reuss didn\u2019t say when the electric Corvette would come, but he hinted that a hybrid model could come relatively soon. \u201cWe will offer an electrified Corvette as early as next year,\u201d he wrote. An accompanying video the company posted to Twitter showed what appeared to be a hybrid Corvette, and in another first, showed the front wheels spinning and throwing snow as if being powered. All Corvettes produced by the company previously have been rear-wheel-drive only. While Reuss\u2019s post implies a hybrid Corvette will be based on the current generation of the car, it\u2019s not clear if the all-electric version will be a variation of this car or a completely different future model. \u201cElectrified\u201d is an auto industry term encompassing everything from hybrid to fully electric vehicles, and anything with an electric motor can count as \u201celectrified.\u201d It has long been rumored that the current generation of the Corvette, the first with its gasoline engine mounted behind the seats instead of in the front, could be built with a hybrid system. Reuss has also previously hinted there would be electrified variants of the car. Various companies are working on electric sports cars. Most all-electric vehicles in production so far have been four-door sedans and SUVs, as the need for batteries lends itself to larger and heavier vehicles. Tesla\u2019s first car, the Lotus Elise-based Tesla Roadster, was an electric sports car, but the second-generation of Tesla Roadster, originally unveiled as a prototype in 2017, has yet to go into production. Some manufacturers, such as Lamborghini, have said that current battery technology doesn\u2019t allow for a optimum sports car performance from a purely electric vehicle. Lamborghini has been working on plug-in hybrid sports cars, though. To date, the Corvette is only available in the base Stingray version with 6.2-liter V8 engine producing up to 495 horsepower. A 670 horsepower Corvette Z06 with a 5.5-liter V8 was unveiled last fall. The previous generation of the Corvette included included a 755-horsepower ZR1 version. Nothing like that has yet been announced for the current model but GM engineers have said a major reason for putting the engine in the back was to allow for better performance at extremely high horsepower levels. Besides saving gas, hybrid systems can also be used in high-performance cars to add additional power and to provide for quicker acceleration since electric motors can provide power to the wheels more quickly than gas engines. Ferrari\u2019s most powerful sports cars are hybrids, for instance.   GM has said it plans to produce only zero-emission vehicles, meaning fully electric or powered by hydrogen fuel cells, by 2035.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/25/business/electric-hybrid-corvette/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "business"}}

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) imposed a fine of nearly \u00a328 million ($36 million) on Citigroup (C), while the Bank of England\u2019s Prudential Regulation Authority fined it almost \u00a334 million ($43 million) following investigations into the US bank, according to statements from the authorities. The regulators reduced their fines by 30% because Citigroup agreed to settle the matter. Without that discount, the combined fine would have topped \u00a388 million ($112 million). \u201cWe are pleased to resolve this matter from more than two years ago, which arose from an individual error that was identified and corrected within minutes,\u201d a Citigroup spokesperson told CNN. \u201cWe immediately took steps to strengthen our systems and controls, and remain committed to ensuring full regulatory compliance.\u201d The spokesperson declined to comment on reports that the trade was the result of a fat-finger error, where incorrect data is inputted because the wrong key is pressed.  The Bank of England highlighted an incident in May 2022 when one of Citigroup\u2019s \u201cexperienced\u201d traders sold $1.4 billion worth of stocks on European exchanges in error, triggering what brokers described at the time as a \u201cflash crash.\u201d In its statement, the FCA said the unnamed trader had intended to sell stocks worth only $58 million, but made an \u201cinputting error,\u201d which resulted in an order to sell $444 billion. Citigroup\u2019s systems blocked $255 billion of that, meaning that $189 billion was sent to its trading platform for sale \u201cover the rest of the day.\u201d In total, $1.4 billion worth of stocks was sold before the trader canceled the transaction. \u201cThere was no\u00a0hard block\u00a0that would have\u00a0rejected\u00a0this\u00a0large\u00a0erroneous\u00a0basket of equities\u00a0in\u00a0its\u00a0entirety\u00a0and prevented\u00a0any of it\u00a0reaching the market,\u201d the FCA said, adding that the failings risked creating \u201ca disorderly market.\u201d The FCA also highlighted the ability of the trader to manually override a pop-up alert, without being required to read all the details it contained, and the bank\u2019s \u201cineffective\u201d real-time monitoring,\u00a0which\u00a0meant alerts were escalated too slowly. Following the incident, Citigroup has taken steps to \u201cimprove and strengthen\u201d the security of its trading systems, the central bank said. \u201cFirms involved in trading must have effective controls in place in order to manage the risks involved. (Citigroup) failed to meet the standards we expect in this area, resulting in today\u2019s fine,\u201d said Sam Woods, chief executive officer of the Prudential Regulation Authority. Another costly error for Citigroup It is not the first time Citigroup has blundered. In 2020, the bank accidentally wired $900 million in interest payments to the lenders of cosmetics company Revlon \u2014\u00a0more than 100 times the intended amount. Some lenders returned the money, but others did not. A US district court judge ruled in 2021 that the bank would not be allowed to recover the outstanding $500 million. Another trading mishap in 2014 \u2014\u00a0unconnected to Citigroup \u2014 rattled the Japanese stock market. An anonymous broker made and then swiftly canceled orders for more than $600 billion worth of stocks, the BBC reported at the time.

{"id": "2024_05_22_investing_graceland-foreclosure-hearing", "text": "Graceland can stay in the hands of Elvis Presley\u2019s family for the time being, after a Tennessee court chancellor ruled Wednesday that a mysterious company trying to sell it likely committed fraud. Chancellor JoeDae Jenkins said that a planned foreclosure sale of Graceland, Elvis Presley\u2019s historic Memphis home, would be postponed at least until a future hearing determines who maintains rightful ownership of the estate. A bizarre series of events set the late singer\u2019s granddaughter against a mysterious company that claimed Elvis\u2019 daughter gave it Graceland\u2019s deed. A hearing in the Shelby County, Tennessee, Chancery Court determined that Thursday\u2019s planned foreclosure auction of Graceland would irreparably harm Elvis\u2019 granddaughter, Danielle Riley Keough, who sued to block the sale. Keough took ownership of the estate and popular tourist attraction after her mother and Elvis\u2019 daughter, Lisa Marie Presley, died in January 2023. \u201cThe estate is considered unique under Tennessee law, and in being unique the loss of the real estate will be considered irreparable harm,\u201d Jenkins said. Jenkins also said there was evidence that a company trying to foreclose on Graceland had forged documents that it claimed gave it the right to sell the property. After the hearing, a person who said he represented the company trying to foreclose said it would drop its claim. In a statement, Graceland said the property will continue to operate. \u201cAs the court has now made clear, there was no validity to the claims,\u201d the statement read. \u201cThere will be no foreclosure.\u00a0\u00a0Graceland will continue to operate as it has for the past 42 years, ensuring that Elvis fans from around the world can continue to have a best in class experience when visiting his iconic home.\u201d Who holds the rights to Graceland? A company called Naussany Investments & Private Lending LLC had claimed that Lisa Marie Presley failed to pay back a $3.8 million loan it had given her \u2013 and Naussany said Presley had put up Graceland as collateral against the loan. Seeking repayment, it had scheduled an auction of the estate. This was no typical foreclosure sale. Keough filed a lawsuit earlier this month, claiming there was no such loan. She also claims\u00a0Naussany isn\u2019t even a real company. \u201cThese documents are fraudulent,\u201d Keough\u2019s lawsuit alleges. \u201cLisa Marie Presley never borrowed money from Naussany Investments and never gave a deed of trust to Naussany Investments.\u201d The lawsuit alleges Naussany Investments & Private Lending LLC \u201cappears to be a false entity created for the purpose of defrauding.\u201d Although Naussany provided what appears to be a 2018 notarized promissory note signed by Lisa Marie Presley to put up Graceland as collateral, Keough\u2019s lawsuit said that was a forgery. In a signed affidavit, the notary public denied ever notarizing anything that Lisa Marie Presley had signed. Chancellor Jenkins said that affidavit was sufficient evidence to delay the foreclosure until a hearing can determine the facts. But Jenkins also said the evidence suggested Keough was telling the truth. \u201cIt appears you\u2019ll be successful on the merits \u2026 provided you prove at the ultimate hearing fraud alleged by your client and the notary,\u201d Jenkins said Wednesday. Naussany said it is not going to proceed with its claim and \u201cwill be withdrawing all claims with prejudice,\u201d according to a statement released\u00a0today\u00a0by a person\u00a0identified as a representative of\u00a0Naussany Investments & Private Lending LLC, the company accused of trying to fraudulently foreclose on the historic property. \u201cDue to the Deed of Trust not being recorded and the loan being obtained in different state, legal action would have to be filed in multiple states and Naussany Investments & Private Lending will not acquire to proceed,\u201d the company said.. \u201cThat comes from consultation of the lawyers for the company. There was no harm meant on Ms. Keough for her mothers LMP mis habits and mis managing of money.\u201d Elvis Presley Enterprises, the company that manages Presley\u2019s estate, concurred that Naussany\u2019s claim was illegitimate. \u201cElvis Presley Enterprises can confirm that these claims are fraudulent,\u201d the company said. \u201cThere is no foreclosure sale. Simply put, the counter lawsuit has been filed is to stop the fraud.\u201d A judge last week granted a temporary restraining order, preventing Naussany from selling Graceland. Jenkins extended that order Wednesday. An estate in dispute Following Lisa Marie Presley\u2019s death, Keogh and her grandmother, Priscilla Presley, fought over the rights to her estate \u2013 including Graceland. Ultimately, Keough and Presley settled, and Keough became Graceland\u2019s sole owner. In 2004, Lisa Marie Presley sold 85% of Elvis Presley Enterprises\u2019 assets in a\u00a0deal reportedly worth more than $100 million. But she maintained complete ownership of the\u00a0Graceland mansion and Elvis\u2019 personal items housed in what is now the Graceland museum, according to the Graceland website. Graceland is one of the South\u2019s biggest tourist draws, visited by hundreds of thousands of people each year, Graceland says on its website. Lisa Marie Presley annually earned seven figures from it, based on a court filing in her 2022 divorce. Who is Riley Keough? Keough was born to parents Lisa Marie Presley and musician Danny Keough in 1989. She is a well-known actor, appearing in \u201cMad Max Fury Road\u201d and other Hollywood hits. She also appears in Hulu\u2019s \u201cUnder the Bridge.\u201d First credited as an actor in the movie the Runaways in 2010, Keough has racked up a number of acting roles. She recently starred in \u201cDaisy Jones & The Six,\u201d where she played a troubled musician in a band about to make it big. In a piece for Vanity Fair, Keough revealed she has a daughter, Tupelo Storm Smith-Petersen, who was born via surrogate in August 2022. Elvis was born in Tupelo, Mississippi, in 1935, but Keough said the name is a tribute to her late brother, Benjamin Storm Keough, who died in 2020 at the age of 27.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/investing/graceland-foreclosure-hearing/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl", "text": "Sam Altman has agreed to return to lead OpenAI, the company said in a Tuesday post on X, just days after his surprise ouster as chief executive sparked an employee revolt that threatened to undermine what has been the leading company in the fledgling artificial intelligence industry. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman wrote that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft, which is the ChatGPT maker\u2019s biggest financial backer. The announcement appears to bring to an end days of chaos for the AI industry that included negotiations over who should lead OpenAI and how the firm should be run, as well as broader discussions about just how fast the arms race to develop AI technology should be moving. The details of Altman\u2019s firing and re-hiring remain murky. In its announcement Friday, OpenAI claimed that Altman had been insufficiently \u201ccandid\u201d with the board. That ambiguous language sent the rumor mill flying. But a key factor in Altman\u2019s ouster was the presence of\u00a0tensions between Altman, who favored pushing AI development more aggressively, and members of the original OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the crisis. As of Monday morning, Nadella had announced that Altman, along with fellow OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, would be joining Microsoft to lead a new AI research division. OpenAI said it had hired former Twitch chief Emmett Shear as interim CEO. But then hundreds of OpenAI employees, nearly the company\u2019s entire staff, threatened to leave, potentially for Microsoft, if the company\u2019s board didn\u2019t resign and reinstate Altman as CEO. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it invested billions in to help bolster its ambitions in developing AI, which many in Silicon Valley think will be the most important wave of technological advancement in the coming decades. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Microsoft CEO\u00a0Satya Nadella said on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d Altman\u2019s vision to quickly roll out and commercialize AI tools also appears to have won out. Publicly, Altman has long cautioned about risks posed by AI, and he\u202fhas pledged to lawmakers and customers that he would move OpenAI forward responsibly. \u201cIs [AI] gonna be like the printing press that diffused knowledge, power and learning widely across the landscape that empowered ordinary, everyday individuals that led to greater flourishing, that led above all to greater liberty?\u201d he said in a May Senate subcommittee hearing pressing for regulation. \u201cOr is it gonna be more like the atom bomb \u2014 huge technological breakthrough, but the consequences (severe, terrible) continue to haunt us to this day?\u201d But inside the company, Altman had been pushing to bring products to market more quickly and to sell them for a profit. Altman announced a few weeks ago at OpenAI\u2019s first-ever developer day that the company would make tools available so anyone could create their own version of ChatGPT. OpenAI has also worked with Microsoft to roll out ChatGPT-like technology across Microsoft\u2019s products. OpenAI and iPhone designer Jony Ive had also reportedly\u202fbeen in talks to raise $1 billion from Japanese conglomerate SoftBank for an AI device to replace the smartphone. \u2014 CNN\u2019s Juliana Liu and Diksha Madhok contributed reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_economy_fed-minutes-wall-street-inflation", "text": "Earlier this week, some officials at the Federal Reserve said they\u2019re no longer worried about inflation reaccelerating, after data showed that progress stalled in the first quarter. Optimism spurred by the latest inflation data pushed all three major stock indexes to new record highs. But now Wall Street, eager for rate cuts, is on edge again. That\u2019s because minutes from the central bank\u2019s latest policy meeting released Wednesday showed that \u201cvarious\u201d officials said they would be willing to raise interest rates if necessary and that there were doubts as to whether financial conditions are restrictive enough to keep inflation from resurging. It spooked investors: The Dow slid more than 300 points following the release of the minutes. Moreover, the Fed minutes seemed to outweigh comments from Fed Governor Christopher Waller, a key messenger of monetary policy moves, who told CNBC in an interview Tuesday that the Fed could cut rates by the \u201cend of the year.\u201d In a separate speech earlier that day, he said \u201cthe data suggests that inflation isn\u2019t accelerating.\u201d \u201cMore recent data on the economy indicate that restrictive monetary policy is helping to cool off aggregate demand and the inflation data for April suggests that progress toward 2% has likely resumed,\u201d Waller said at an event hosted by the Peterson Institute for International Economics. He pointed to recent figures on employment and retail spending coming in weaker than expected, both of which should help take some steam out of inflation. But some financial leaders remain doubtful that the Fed is feeling confident enough to cut rates soon. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said Wednesday at an event hosted by Boston College that the Fed probably won\u2019t begin to cut rates this year. \u201cI\u2019m still at zero cuts,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we\u2019re set up for stickier inflation.\u201d Some Fed officials say another rate hike isn\u2019t likely Fed officials have mostly sounded a little more optimistic about inflation recently, after the Consumer Price Index for April finally provided some welcome news. The inflation report was mostly in line with expectations, which was an improvement from the disappointing figures for the first three months of the year. \u201cIt\u2019s important not to focus too much on just one data point,\u201d said Fed Vice Chair Philip Jefferson at an event hosted by the Mortgage Bankers Association on Monday. However, he noted that the April CPI data was nonetheless \u201ca good sign for us.\u201d San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly told Axios in an interview that published Monday that she doesn\u2019t \u201csee any evidence right now that we need to adjust upwards.\u201d Fed Chair Jerome Powell said earlier this month that it may just be a matter of giving high interest rates some time to kick in. \u201cWhat that has told us is that we\u2019ll need to be patient and let restrictive policy do its work,\u201d he said during a moderated discussion with European Central Bank Governing Council member Klaas Knot. Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester told Bloomberg on Monday that she also thinks interest rates are high enough to deal with inflation. But despite the hopeful Fedspeak on inflation, there is still an uneasiness in the air about what\u2019s really happening and what the central bank will do. \u201cFor now, the Fed says it wants to see more evidence that inflation is easing, which implies higher-for-longer rates until that data materializes,\u201d wrote Chris Larkin, managing director of trading and investing for E*TRADE in a note Wednesday. \u201cTraders will have to wait until next week\u2019s PCE price index to get another read on inflation and update their expectations for rate cuts,\u201d he said.

{"id": "2024_03_01_tech_aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl", "text": "A London-based technology company is looking to \u201cdemocratize\u201d talent-identification and scouting in soccer using a mobile app. Free to download and available globally, the aiScout app allows aspiring soccer stars to enter virtual trials for professional clubs by uploading self-recorded footage of themselves completing a series of drills. It offers 75 exercises, designed to test a range of skills, with videos showing users how to complete them. Performances are automatically scored by artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The data can then be accessed by clubs, allowing their scouts to peruse scores for viable talent, honing their search with a variety of filters; from age and gender to position on the pitch. The app currently has two English Premier League (EPL) partners, Chelsea and Burnley, and clubs can tailor their in-app trials to meet specific needs and set their own benchmarks by having their academy players complete the same drills. \u201cWe\u2019re putting that data up front to make better use of [the scouts\u2019] time,\u201d said Richard Felton-Thomas, chief operating officer of ai.io, the company behind the app. \u201cTo say [to scouts], \u2018Go over to this place today because there\u2019s three players in that game that are all actually beating your Chelsea standard\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s going to be the best use of your time.\u2019\u201d It already appears to be working for some. Ben Greenwood had never had a trial with a professional club until he downloaded the app in 2019. After uploading footage of himself, the 17-year-old landed a trial with Chelsea, becoming the first user of the app to get a trial with a pro club. He signed a contract\u00a0with EPL team Bournemouth\u00a0in 2021. \u2018It\u2019s more about evolution\u2019 Having beta-tested in with players spanning 125 countries, Greenwood among them, 135 players have been trialed or signed by pro clubs or national teams through the app \u2014 which fully launched in September 2023 \u2014 according to Felton-Thomas. Just over 100,000 players make up the current database, but with over 100 clubs lined up to join Chelsea and Burnley, as well as a multi-year partnership with Major League Soccer in the US announced last May, Felton-Thomas projects user numbers to surge into the millions as the operation ramps up this year. Felton-Thomas said the \u201clion\u2019s share\u201d of its income comes from charging clubs a license fee to run the platform. Annual fees vary depending on the size of the club and the tools they require, ranging from six figures for \u201ctier one\u201d sides like Chelsea, to thousands of pounds for clubs lower down the footballing pyramid. The use of smart technology in sport continues to expand, including\u00a0AI commentary tools and wearable tech for elite athletes. The global market for sports analytics, valued at\u00a0$2.7 billion\u00a0in 2023, is projected to grow 22% by the end of the decade, according to market research firm Grand View Research. Should soccer talent scouts be concerned about being edged out by the arrival of AI in their industry? For Felton-Thomas, new technologies can co-exist with traditional methods. \u201cIt\u2019s more about evolution than revolution,\u201d Felton-Thomas explained. \u201cWe can\u2019t tell you when that player\u2019s actually in that match, how does he deal with adversity? What happens when he\u2019s 2-0 down? What happens when someone\u2019s shouting at him? What happens when he\u2019s just made a massive mistake?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got the ability to just augment real people to do their jobs better and faster, which then gives an opportunity to the player through the AI, but you\u2019re still actually just connecting them to the human on the other side, which is the club and the scout.\u201d While football remains ai.io\u2019s primary focus, the company is looking into opportunities in other sports to launch in the coming years. Further ahead, it may branch out beyond sports. \u201cYou think about the notion that you can be at home and analyze your movements, and how this could spin into health care, physical assessments for military disciplines and emergency services,\u201d Felton-Thomas told CNN.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/01/tech/aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2022_04_27_business_diamonds-manmade-demand", "text": "It\u2019s proposal season, and engagements are on the rise. So are factory-made diamond sales. Not that you\u2019d know the difference. Man-made diamonds look the same as naturally occurring ones. The only noticeable difference is the price tag. \u201cThe result is really stunning,\u201d said Edahn Golan, an independent diamond industry analyst. He said March data showed the number of engagement rings sold that featured a manufactured diamond jumped 63% compared to last year, while the number of engagement rings sold with a natural diamond declined 25% in the same period. Going back by another month, to February, the data showed the number of rings sold with lab diamonds that month surged even more, to 80% compared to a year earlier while the number fell by 13% for natural diamond engagement rings.  \u201cThe big fear in the natural diamonds industry is that consumers will start accepting lab-grown diamonds in engagement rings,\u201d he said. Too late. \u201cIt\u2019s actually happening.\u201d  Tide is shifting Why are consumers flocking to man-made diamonds? Cost is the most obvious reason. The average retail price of the most popular one carat round man-made diamond for an engagement ring in March was $2,318, Golan said. \u201cThis is substantially less \u2013 as much as 73% cheaper \u2013 than a natural diamond of the same size, cut and clarity as the man-made diamond, which would cost $8,740,\u201d he said. Plus, the lower cost allows couples to buy a bigger stone.  \u201cA lab diamond is a real diamond, but maybe it took a few weeks to make it,\u201d said Golan. \u201cNatural diamonds were formed over 800 million to three billion years and there isn\u2019t an infinite supply of them.\u201d  This makes natural diamonds quite a bit more expensive, and prices are likely to rise as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has tightened the supply chain for natural raw diamonds. The sanctions directly target Alrosa, partly owned by the Russian government, which the US government identified as the world\u2019s largest diamond mining company, accounting for 28% of global diamond output. Man-made diamonds are also becoming popular as consumers are more aware and educated about them, said Dan Moran, a third-generation diamond expert and owner of LA-based fine jeweler Concierge Diamonds. Moran said the typical buyer of man-made diamonds is typically younger than 40 and very budget conscious. Mined diamonds have a controversial history that\u2019s tied to the use of child labor in some African diamond mines as well as sales of illegally-traded \u201cconflict diamonds\u201d that fund conflict in war-torn areas. Among Millennials and Gen Z, their eco-conscious mindset and ethical concerns about natural diamond sourcing is another factor influencing their preference for non-traditional engagement rings, according to a report from wedding planning website The Knot. Small but growing share of the diamond market Although its slice is growing, the market share for man-made diamonds remains relatively small. Currently, about 7% of the specialty diamond jewelry market is represented by man-made diamonds, up from 3% in 2020, said Golan.  Some major jewelry retailers are driving the effort to take man-made diamonds mainstream. In 2021, the world\u2019s largest jewelry company, Pandora\n            \n                (PANDY), made a major shift by announcing it would stop using mined diamonds and would swap to lab-created diamonds in its jewelry.  Pandora said it\u2019s instituting the change as part of an effort to sell sustainable jewelry, and also because consumers increasingly are asking for it. Signet,\n            \n                (SIG) the largest jewelry company in the United States (which owns Zales, Kay Jewelers and Jared chains) called out the popularity of lab diamond jewelry in its March earnings call with analysts. Calling it a \u201cfast-growing category\u201d in its jewelry portfolio, Signet CEO Virginia Drosos told analysts that lab-created diamonds are among the big jewelry trends she expects this year.  The company said it has expanded its man-made bridal jewelry selection in both its Zales and Kay Jewelers stores in response to the increased demand.  Fine jewelry brand Charles and Colvard, which makes lab-created diamonds, said consumers don\u2019t just want to look good with the jewelry they are wearing, they also want to feel good about it. \u201cAs the momentum for conscious consumerism grows, the surge towards lab grown diamonds isn\u2019t surprising,\u201d said Don O\u2019Connell, president and CEO of Charles & Colvard. \u201c[Consumers] want to know the origins of their stones and be reassured they\u2019re conflict-free. They\u2019re embracing the choice to purchase a piece of fine jewelry that aligns with their values.\u201d Lab-grown diamond brand VRAI said the pandemic, too, has sparked attention and action toward social and environmental issues. It said consumers are being more thoughtful and reassessing their purchasing habits, as well as the companies and industries they are supporting. There is, however, one important consideration for anyone buying lab-created diamonds: Man-made diamonds have little resale value.  So while you may not be able to tell a natural diamond from a factory made variety, someone with a trained eye can, said Golan. Once a stone is identified as a factory diamond, even though you paid a lot less for it, you also won\u2019t get much for it.  But the value of a ring isn\u2019t just monetary. \u201cAs a professional in the industry, I am asked all the time by people about what I think about a ring they have,\u201d said Moran, of Concierge Jewelers. \u201cI always say, if you love it, be happy with it. An engagement ring is a symbol of commitment and enduring love.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/27/business/diamonds-manmade-demand/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_tech_openai-scarlett-johansson-lawsuit-sam-altman", "text": "Will Scarlett Johansson sue OpenAI for creating a voice assistant that sounds like the actor\u2019s performance in the 2013 film \u201cHer,\u201d about a man who falls in love with an artificial intelligence? That\u2019s how things could go after Johansson said OpenAI tried to hire her to voice an AI assistant for ChatGPT and, when she refused, forged ahead with a sound-alike voice. OpenAI\u2019s co-founder and CEO, Sam Altman, could be directly in the crosshairs of such a lawsuit. Now, legal experts say Johansson may have a powerful and credible claim in court if she does decide to sue, pointing to a long string of past cases that could lead to significant damages for one of the world\u2019s leading AI companies and raise questions about the industry\u2019s readiness to deal with AI\u2019s many messy complications. That OpenAI was apparently unaware of that legal history, or at worst willfully ignorant of it, highlights what some critics say is a lack of industry oversight in AI and a need for greater protections for creators. OpenAI didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. OpenAI\u2019s legal risk There are two types of law that could potentially be involved here, according to legal experts, but only one is likely to come into play based on the currently known facts. The first is copyright law. If OpenAI had directly sampled Johansson\u2019s films or other published works to create Sky, the flirty voice assistant demoed in an update to ChatGPT, then OpenAI might face a copyright problem if the company didn\u2019t obtain permission beforehand. That doesn\u2019t appear to be the case, at least based on OpenAI\u2019s past statements. The company claims not to have used Johansson\u2019s actual voice, the company said in a blog post Sunday, but rather \u201ca different professional actress using her own natural speaking voice.\u201d While that might be enough to deflect a copyright claim, it almost certainly wouldn\u2019t insulate OpenAI from the second type of law at issue, according to Tiffany Li, a law professor focused on intellectual property and technology at the University of San Francisco. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if OpenAI used any of Scarlett Johansson\u2019s actual voice samples,\u201d Li posted on Threads. \u201cShe still has a viable right of publicity case here.\u201d How publicity rights laws work Multiple states have right-of-publicity laws that protect individuals\u2019 likenesses from being stolen or misused, and California\u2019s \u2014 where Hollywood and OpenAI are based \u2014 is among the strongest. The California law prohibits the unauthorized use of anyone\u2019s \u201cname, voice, signature, photograph, or likeness\u201d for the purposes of \u201cadvertising or selling, or soliciting purchases of, products, merchandise, goods or services.\u201d Unlike a copyright claim, which is about intellectual property, a right-of-publicity claim is more about the unauthorized use of a person\u2019s identity or public persona for profit. Here, Johansson could accuse OpenAI of illegally monetizing who she is by essentially fooling users into thinking she had voiced Sky. One defense OpenAI could mount is that its now-viral videos showcasing Sky\u2019s capabilities weren\u2019t technically made as advertisements or meant to drive purchases, said John Bergmayer, legal director at Public Knowledge, a consumer advocacy group. But, he added, it could be a rather thin argument. \u201cI believe use in a highly hyped promo video or presentation easily meets that test,\u201d he said. In addition to saying it never used Johansson\u2019s actual voice and that its videos weren\u2019t advertisements, OpenAI could also say it never intended to precisely mimic Johansson. But there\u2019s substantial case law \u2014 and one very inconvenient fact for OpenAI \u2014 undercutting that defense, legal experts say. A Bette Midler precedent There are roughly a half-dozen cases in this space that show how OpenAI may land in hot water. Here are two of the biggest ones. In 1988, the singer Bette Midler won a lawsuit against Ford Motor Company over an advertisement featuring what sounded like her voice. In fact, the song in the ad had been recorded by one of Midler\u2019s backup singers after Midler turned down the opportunity to record the ad. The similarities between the reproduction and the original were so striking that some people told Midler they believed she had performed in the commercial. The US Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ruled in Midler\u2019s favor. \u201cWhy did the defendants ask Midler to sing if her voice was not of value to them?\u201d the court wrote in its decision. \u201cWhy did they studiously acquire the services of a sound-alike and instruct her to imitate Midler if Midler\u2019s voice was not of value to them? What they sought was an attribute of Midler\u2019s identity. Its value was what the market would have paid for Midler to have sung the commercial in person.\u201d In a similar case decided by the 9th Circuit in 1992, the singer Tom Waits won $2.6 million in damages against the snack food maker Frito-Lay over a Doritos ad that featured an imitation of Waits\u2019 signature raspy voice. The court in that case doubled down on its decision in Midler, further enshrining the idea that California\u2019s right of publicity law protects a person\u2019s voice. The situation involving Johansson and OpenAI bears a remarkable resemblance to these prior cases. According to Johansson, OpenAI approached her to perform as Sky; Johansson declined. Then, months later, OpenAI released a version of Sky that was widely compared to Johansson, to the point that Johansson said her \u201cclosest friends \u2026 could not tell the difference.\u201d Whether OpenAI can survive a potential publicity rights claim may hinge on intent \u2014 that is, whether the company can prove it did not set out to imitate Johansson\u2019s voice, said James Grimmelmann, a law professor at Cornell University. In its Sunday blog post, OpenAI said that Sky was \u201cnot an imitation of Scarlett Johansson\u201d but that\u00a0with each of its AI voices, the company\u2019s goal was simply to create \u201can approachable voice that inspires trust,\u201d one that contains a \u201crich tone\u201d and is \u201cnatural and easy to listen to.\u201d On Monday evening, Altman responded to Johansson\u2019s statement with one of his own, claiming that the company \u201ccast the voice actor behind Sky\u2019s voice before any outreach to Ms. Johansson\u201d and apologizing for not communicating better. But OpenAI may have already undermined itself. \u201cOpenAI might have had a plausible case if they hadn\u2019t spent the last two weeks hinting to everyone that they had just created Samantha from \u2018Her,\u2019\u201d Grimmelmann said, referring to Johansson\u2019s character from the 2013 film. \u201cThere was widespread public recognition that Sky was Samantha, and intentionally so.\u201d The widespread parallels users were drawing with Johansson were reinforced when\u00a0Altman posted to X on the day of the product\u2019s announcement: \u201cher.\u201d Johansson\u2019s statement said Altman used this post to insinuate \u201cthe similarity was intentional.\u201d As recently as last fall, Altman was telling audiences that \u201cHer\u201d was not only \u201cincredibly prophetic\u201d but also his own favorite science-fiction film. Taken together, those facts suggest OpenAI may have wanted users to implicitly associate Sky with Johansson in ways that California\u2019s law is interpreted to prevent. Altman\u2019s post was \u201cincredibly unwise,\u201d Bergmayer said. \u201cGiven the facts here \u2014 the negotiations, the tweet \u2014 even if OpenAI was using an actress who just happens to sound like Johansson, I think there\u2019s still a strong chance they\u2019d be liable.\u201d Lost in deepfake translation The situation involving Johansson is a high-profile example of what can go wrong in the age of deepfakes and AI. While California\u2019s publicity law protects all individuals, some state statutes only protect famous people, and not all states have such legislation on the books. What\u2019s more, those existing laws may protect a person\u2019s image or even voice but may not cover some of the things you can now do with AI, such as asking a model to recreate art \u201cin the style\u201d of a famous artist. \u201cThis situation does show why we need a federal right of publicity law, since not every case will conveniently involve California,\u201d Bergmayer said. Some tech companies have gotten involved. Adobe, the maker of Photoshop, has pushed a proposal it is calling the FAIR Act to create a federal right against impersonation by AI. The company argues that while it is in the business of selling AI tools as part of its creative software, it has a vested interest in ensuring its customers can continue to reap the rewards of their own work. \u201cThe worry you have as a creator is that AI is going to displace their economic livelihood because it\u2019s training on their work,\u201d said Dana Rao, Adobe\u2019s general counsel and chief trust officer. \u201cThat\u2019s the existential angst that you\u2019re feeling out there in the community. And what we\u2019re saying at Adobe is that we\u2019re always going to provide the world\u2019s greatest technology to our creators [but that] we do believe in responsible innovation.\u201d Some US lawmakers are working on proposals to address the issue. Last year, a bipartisan group of senators unveiled a discussion draft of the NO FAKES Act, a bill intended to protect creators. Another draft bill, in the House, is known as the No AI Fraud Act. But digital rights groups and academics have warned that the legislation is far from perfect, leaving gaping loopholes in some areas while also creating potential unintended consequences in others. Questions abound about protecting free expression, such as the ability for people to use others\u2019 likenesses for educational or other non-commercial uses, as well as rights to a person\u2019s image after death \u2014 important in the recreation of dead actors in movies or music, which could ultimately harm living performers, according to Jennifer Rothman, an intellectual property expert and law professor at the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cThis opens the door for record labels to cheaply create AI-generated performances, including by dead celebrities, and exploit this lucrative option over more costly performances by living humans,\u201d Rothman wrote in a blog post in October on the NO FAKES Act. The debate over publicity rights in Congress is part of a much broader effort by lawmakers to wrestle with AI, one that isn\u2019t likely to be resolved anytime soon \u2014 and reflecting the complexity of the issues at stake.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/tech/openai-scarlett-johansson-lawsuit-sam-altman/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "business"}}

For many critics of Live Nation, the Swift debacle revealed how a lack of competition has led to harms ranging from poor customer service to confusing pricing to expensive ticketing fees to restrictions on ticket resales \u2014 amounting to what many consumers complain of as death by a thousand cuts. The fiasco led lawmakers to grill a top executive of Ticketmaster\u2019s parent company, Live Nation Entertainment, in January last year over the company\u2019s practices.

{"id": "2024_05_21_tech_microsoft-ai-copilot-plus-build-2024", "text": "Microsoft\u00a0jumped headfirst into building artificial intelligence directly into its Windows operating system on Monday, announcing new AI computers that could help ramp up flagging PC sales. The developments push the company closer to its long-time goal to \u201cbuild computers that understand us versus us having to understand computers,\u201d CEO Satya Nadella told the audience at the company\u2019s annual developer conference at its Redmond, Washington headquarters. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re really close to that real breakthrough,\u201d he added. The computers, which are packed with processors that power advanced AI tools, come as PC sales have stalled for years. The company hopes the new machines will boost sales and revive excitement, particularly as AI is expected to become increasingly part of everyday life. Microsoft\u2019s new lineup of Copilot+ PCs, which feature a new Surface Pro tablet and Surface laptop, include AI tools that don\u2019t require internet connection \u2013 the AI processing occurs directly on the device The new hardware runs on OpenAI\u2019s new GPT-4o technology, which aims to turn ChatGPT into a digital personal assistant that can engage in real-time, spoken conversations and interact using text and \u201cvision.\u201d Announced last week, it can view screenshots, photos, documents or charts uploaded by users and have a conversation about them. The new hardware also plays up Microsoft\u2019s existing AI assistant called Copilot, which works across various products, including Bing and Microsoft 365. It can help with tasks such as writing, keeping track of\u00a0emails in Outlook or designing\u00a0presentations in PowerPoint. One new feature, called Recall, acts as a personal \u201ctime machine,\u201d allowing users to quickly find things from their computer, such as documents, images and websites. Another allows for real-time translation into more than 40 more languages locally on the device. The company also showed off a new tool called Team Copilot, which serves as a personal assistant, allowing it act as a meeting facilitator to create agendas or take notes on behalf of the whole team, not just an individual user. Microsoft isn\u2019t alone in its AI PC ambition. Dell and Lenovo also recently debuted AI-first PC computers under the Copilot+ AI umbrella, an emerging category that experts widely believe will become the next stage of computing. (Copilot+ is the name of the line of hardware that supports the Copilot software.) Next month, Apple is expected to announce new AI-powered tools for the iPhone and Mac at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference. \u201cOver time, AI capability will become a ubiquitous feature, but Microsoft and its partners have made a solid start,\u201d Geoff Blaber, CEO at CCS Insight, told CNN. \u201cThey will need to work hard to ensure that AI becomes a lot more than just a meaningless descriptor with a growing number of features.\u201d Microsoft\u2019s advancements also come at a time when the PC market is ripe for innovation. \u201cThis is a much-needed catalyst,\u201d Blaber added. Although the Surface line is relatively small within the overall PC market, it serves as an aspirational brand and a frontrunner in terms of innovation, according to Jitesh Ubrani, a research manager at market research firm IDC. But Microsoft\u2019s move is more reflective of a greater shift happening in the industry toward AI. In June, Apple will likely introduce generative AI \u2013 artificial intelligence that is capable of creating new output from images to text \u2013 across its iOS and Mac platforms. Reports indicate the company could unveil an AI-powered chatbot that runs on OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT technology, the same technology that underpins Microsoft\u2019s new CoPilot+ line. Still, Microsoft has already established itself as an early leader in this space with ChatGPT integrated into key products. And it appears those efforts are paying off. Last month, Microsoft reported quarterly profits of $21.9 billion, up from $18.3 billion a year ago. Revenue grew 17% year-over-year growth to $61.9 billion. Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud business also experienced strong growth \u2013 revenue grew 31% \u2013 boosted by AI tailwinds. The company continues to go all in on AI in other ways, too. Earlier this month, Microsoft said it is pouring $3.3 billion into building a data hub in Wisconsin to train employees and manufacturers on how to best use artificial intelligence. The new center aims to create 2,300 union construction jobs and 2,000 permanent jobs over time, according to Microsoft. It also plans to use the center to train about 100,000 workers across the state.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/tech/microsoft-ai-copilot-plus-build-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_media_israels-seizure-ap-equipment-free-press", "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:\u00a0A version of this article first appeared in the \u201cReliable Sources\u201d newsletter.\u00a0Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here. Israel\u00a0must do better. The\u00a0Benjamin Netanyahu-led country on Tuesday took the outrageous step of seizing a camera and other video equipment used by\u00a0The Associated Press\u00a0to\u00a0broadcast a live feed of\u00a0Gaza\u00a0\u2014 a decision the country only reversed amid severe backlash from free press advocates and following a\u00a0White House\u00a0request. \u201cAs soon as we learned about the reports, the White House and the\u00a0State Department\u00a0immediately engaged with the Government of Israel at high levels to express our serious concern and ask them to reverse this action,\u201d\u00a0National Security Council\u00a0spokesperson\u00a0Adrienne Watson\u00a0told me, an action that unquestionably played a key role in persuading the Israeli government to publicly backtrack. The brazen anti-media action against the AP on Tuesday, however, is only the latest from Israel, which over the course of the country\u2019s bloody war on the terrorist group\u00a0Hamas\u00a0has engaged in a pattern of behavior that calls into serious question its commitment to a free and open press. The country\u2019s leadership has for months\u00a0evaded questions\u00a0and calls for accountability over the killing and treatment of journalists in the region as it conducts a protracted military operation in Gaza. Last month, it passed a law that\u00a0allowed it to shut down\u00a0the\u00a0Qatari-owned\u00a0Al Jazeera\u00a0network, with authorities raiding the outlet\u2019s offices and taking the channel off the air. And on Tuesday, it used that same law to target the AP, ostensibly confiscating its equipment because it provided its video feed to Al Jazeera, one of its thousands of global clients. Israel is the only democracy in the middle east \u2014 and it should act like it. The country should put on proud display the principles and ideals that make up a democratic society, serving as a beacon of light in a region otherwise made up of repressive regimes. And as NSC spokesperson Watson noted to me Tuesday, \u201cThe free press is an essential pillar of democracy and members of the media, including AP, do vital work that must be respected.\u201d Unfortunately, the Israeli government\u2019s record on the press no longer reflects what one would expect the leadership of a proud and thriving democracy to look like. Its behavior, instead, is starting to resemble the actions of oppressive governments who seek to control the flow of information and quash dissent. While Israel bowed to pressure on Tuesday and returned the AP\u2019s equipment, the government notably offered no public apology to the renowned wire service. Instead, Israel\u2019s\u00a0Communications Minister Shlomo Karhi\u00a0simply said that he had \u201cordered that the equipment be returned to the AP news agency.\u201d The lack of remorse, coupled with the fact that the new law that was wielded against Al Jazeera remains in effect, speaks volumes about the government\u2019s view of the news media amid its devastating war with Hamas. As the AP noted after its equipment was returned Tuesday, the underlying issues are still unresolved. \u201cWhile we are pleased with this development,\u201d the outlet said, \u201cwe remain concerned about the Israeli government\u2019s use of the foreign broadcaster law and the ability of independent journalists to operate freely in Israel.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/media/israels-seizure-ap-equipment-free-press/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_judges-stern-rebuke-of-elon-musks-x-gives-researchers-fresh-hope", "text": "A federal judge\u2019s decision this week reprimanding Elon Musk\u2019s X will have reverberating effects on efforts to hold influential online platforms accountable, legal experts and advocacy groups say. On Monday, District Judge Charles Breyer dismissed and excoriated a lawsuit by X against online watchdog group Center for Countering Digital Hate as an attempt to silence the non-profit group for sounding alarms about hate speech on the platform. Breyer wrote in Monday\u2019s order that the lawsuit was \u201cunabashedly\u201d about \u201cpunishing\u201d reports written by CCDH, which X had accused of campaigning to drive away its advertisers. Breyer held that the reports were \u201cunquestionably\u201d protected by the group\u2019s free speech rights. Now, that decision could embolden other research groups and Musk critics who have faced legal threats from the billionaire. The CCDH case \u2014 in the US District Court for the Northern District of California \u2014\u00a0has been widely viewed as a bellwether for research and accountability on X, where Musk has restored the accounts of previously banned White supremacists and spreaders of misinformation and where Musk himself has amplified various conspiracy theories. And CCDH is not the only organization that has faced attacks by self-proclaimed \u201cfree speech absolutist\u201d Musk after criticizing or raising concerns about his platform. \u201cThis is an important decision that sees Elon Musk\u2019s lawsuit for what it is \u2014 an effort to punish his critics for constitutionally protected speech and to deter researchers from studying his platform,\u201d said Alex Abdo, litigation director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, which had filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the case arguing that private companies should not be allowed to use breach of contract claims to punish criticism. \u201cSociety needs reliable and ethical research into social media platforms, and often that research relies on being able to study publicly available posts,\u201d Abdo said. X said it plans to appeal Breyer\u2019s decision. Musk\u2019s threats against X critics In his first year as owner of X, formerly known as Twitter, Musk threatened legal action against the Anti-Defamation League for defamation, as well as against Microsoft and Meta for allegedly improper data and trade secret access, respectively. None of those threats ever amounted to real lawsuits. He did, however, sue the progressive media watchdog Media Matters over its\u00a0analysis\u00a0highlighting antisemitic and pro-Nazi content on X, alleging that the group\u2019s testing methodology was not representative of how real users experience the site and that the report was designed to drive away advertisers. Legal experts have described that case as \u201cweak\u201d on the merits and as a \u201cbogus\u201d attempt to chill criticism of X. This week\u2019s court decision may be only a temporary setback in Musk\u2019s wider plan to stifle criticism, said Media Matters CEO Angelo Carusone. Musk\u2019s new playbook, Carusone said, enlists the help of sympathetic Republican attorneys general to investigate independent reporting organizations and tie them up in legal proceedings. The states of Texas and Missouri each announced probes into Media Matters following X\u2019s lawsuit against the group, to which Musk responded, \u201cGreat!\u201d As recently as Monday, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey filed a petition in state court seeking to compel Media Matters\u2019 cooperation with his investigation. The filing came a week after he appeared with Musk in a live event on X \u2014 which Carusone said shows how Musk hopes to deputize the power of government to silence his critics. \u201cThey have every reason to do it,\u201d Carusone said of the AGs\u2019 investigations. \u201cThey get the political benefits, they get the attention. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any cost to them yet. And if they are successful at developing this new playbook, this new terrain, legally, then it\u2019s going to pave the way for them to just use this tool and tactic over and over and over again.\u201d A representative for X did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Carusone\u2019s claims. Researchers face hurdles to studying on-platform behavior Researchers from non-profits and academic institutions have had a harder time studying X since Musk\u2019s takeover in 2022. Academics need large samples of posts, shares, likes and other data to study social media trends in mis- and disinformation, public health, elections and other key topics. But one of Musk\u2019s first changes at X was to put access to platform data behind a steep paywall. Researchers and civil society groups said the new subscription fees \u2014 costing up to $2.5 million a year \u2014\u00a0were \u201coutrageously expensive\u201d and made it impossible to do their work, reducing transparency of a critical platform. The change may have forced some researchers to rely more heavily on first-person observational data to draw conclusions about user behavior on X. Groups like CCDH have also used automated \u201cscraping\u201d of publicly viewable content from X rather than paying the company for data directly, a tactic that helped give rise to X\u2019s initial lawsuit. Efforts by X and other social media companies to limit research transparency makes them less accountable to the public at best and, at worst, could mask malicious behavior, said David Karpf, an associate professor in the School of Media and Public Affairs at George Washington University. \u201cWe need independent research to have any real measure of what\u2019s going on at X/Twitter. Musk is only ever going to release data that makes his company look good,\u201d Karpf said. \u201cThese platforms are too big and too vital to the spread of information to be left unmonitored.\u201d \u201cThis is an election year,\u201d Karpf added, \u201cand the platforms are taking steps to make it harder to monitor how their services are used for malignant ends.\u201d Free Press, another media accountability organization that has been critical of Musk\u2019s leadership of X and which called for advertisers to pause their spending on the platform shortly after his takeover, also celebrated Breyer\u2019s ruling as potentially removing at least one hurdle that watchdog organizations face. \u201cThe guardrails for democracy are hanging by a thread and we have dwindling insights into platform practices as researchers face lawsuits, congressional subpoenas and other scare tactics,\u201d said Nora Benavidez, senior counsel and director of digital rights at Free Press. Ultimately, Benavidez called the ruling \u201ca reminder that platform accountability is essential and will inevitably prevail when up against bullies like Musk who try to silence us.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/judges-stern-rebuke-of-elon-musks-x-gives-researchers-fresh-hope/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "business"}}

But surging prices in recent years dented the luster of \u201cTar-zhay.\u201d The company reported Wednesday that sales at stores open for at least one year dropped 3.7% during its latest quarter from a year ago. It was the fourth-straight quarter of sales declines at Target (TGT). The company\u2019s stock fell around 7% during pre-market trading. Sales dropped primarily in discretionary categories last quarter, Target said, continuing a trend during the inflation spike in which customers spend on necessary items but pare back on stuff they don\u2019t really need. Target is a bellwether for consumers\u2019 spending habits and the retail sector as a whole. Target\u2019s core middle-class customer base has been strained by higher prices and pulled back on discretionary goods like home decor, electronics and nonessential clothing in favor of groceries and everyday essentials. Target has also slumped because of its merchandise mix and higher prices compared to rivals like Walmart. The chain stocks more non-essential merchandise compared to competitors such as Walmart\u00a0(WMT)\u00a0and Costco\u00a0(COST). More than half of Target\u2019s\u00a0merchandise is discretionary. Target in recent years has added more food and essentials to its stores, but still trails Walmart, which gets around half of sales from groceries. Walmart\u2019s sales increased 3.8% last quarter. Target is trying to lure back shoppers by cutting prices on some key items and adding its own brands. Target\u00a0has slashed prices on more than 1,500 popular items starting Monday, ranging from butter to laundry detergent, as the retailer attempts to attract inflation-wary shoppers turned off by high prices. The company also recently created a new house brand called\u00a0Dealworthy\u00a0to take on dollar stores and Walmart.

{"id": "2024_05_17_tech_openai-exec-exits-safety-concerns", "text": "A departing OpenAI executive focused on safety is raising concerns about the company on his way out the door. Jan Leike, who resigned from his role leading the company\u2019s \u201csuperalignment\u201d team this week, said in a thread on X Friday that he disagreed with OpenAI leadership\u2019s \u201ccore priorities\u201d and had \u201creached a breaking point.\u201d \u201cAlignment\u201d or \u201csuperalignment\u201d are terms used in the artificial intelligence space to refer to work on training AI systems to operate within human needs and priorities. Leike joined OpenAI in 2021, and last summer the company announced he would co-lead the superalignment team focused on \u201cscientific and technical breakthroughs to steer and control AI systems much smarter than us.\u201d However, Leike said Friday that in recent months the team has been under-resourced and \u201csailing against the wind.\u201d \u201cSometimes we were struggling for compute and it was getting harder and harder to get this crucial research done,\u201d he said on X, adding that Thursday was his last day at the startup. \u201cBuilding smarter-than-human machines is an inherently dangerous endeavor \u2026 But over the past years, safety culture and processes have taken a backseat to shiny products.\u201d OpenAI CEO Sam Altman responded to Leike\u2019s post saying the company is committed to AI safety. \u201c(I)\u2019m super appreciative of @janleike\u2019s contributions to openai\u2019s alignment research and safety culture, and very sad to see him leave,\u201d Altman said on X. \u201c(H)e\u2019s right we have a lot more to do; we are committed to doing it. (I)\u2019ll have a longer post in the next couple of days.\u201d Leike\u2019s exit, which he announced Wednesday, comes amid a broader leadership shuffle at OpenAI. His resignation followed an announcement on Tuesday by OpenAI co-founder and chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, who also helped lead the superalignment team, that he would leave the company. Sutskever said he was leaving to work on a \u201cproject that is very personally meaningful to me.\u201d But his exit was notable given the central role he played in the dramatic firing \u2014 and return \u2014 of Altman last year, when he voted to remove Altman as chief executive and chairman of the board. CNN contributor Kara Swisher\u00a0previously reported that Sutskever had been concerned that Altman was pushing AI technology \u201ctoo far, too fast.\u201d But days after Altman\u2019s ouster, Sutskever had a change of heart: He signed an employee letter calling for the entire board to resign and for Altman to return. Still, questions about how \u2014 and how quickly \u2014 to develop and publicly release AI technology may have continued to cause tension within the company in the months after Altman regained control of the firm. The executive exits come after OpenAI announced this week that it would make its most powerful AI model yet, GPT-4o, available for free to the public through ChatGPT. The technology will make ChatGPT more like a digital personal assistant, capable of real-time spoken conversations. \u201cI believe much more of our bandwidth should be spent getting ready for the next generations of models, on security, monitoring, preparedness, safety, adversarial robustness, (super)alignment, confidentiality, societal impact, and related topics,\u201d Leike wrote in his X thread on Friday. \u201cThese problems are quite hard to get right, and I am concerned we aren\u2019t on a trajectory to get there.\u201d In the wake of Sutskever and Leike\u2019s exits, OpenAI confirmed to CNN that in recent weeks it had begun to dissolve its superalignment team, and instead was integrating members of the team across its various research groups. A spokesperson for the company said that structure would help OpenAI better achieve its superalignment objectives. CNN\u2019s Samantha Delouya contributed to this report.

{"id": "2023_11_21_opinions_sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic", "text": "The biggest tech news this week is the\u00a0ouster\u00a0of Sam Altman from his role as CEO of OpenAI, a move that has shaken the company and the industry. Hundreds of OpenAI employees have threatened to\u00a0resign. Altman has already\u00a0moved on\u00a0to a role at Microsoft. And OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is on its\u00a0third CEO\u00a0in as many days. It\u2019s all very juicy. But this drama should also be raising larger questions, far beyond one company\u2019s internal hirings and firings, including: Who are the people making the decisions\u00a0that will determine so much of our technological future? What guiding principles are they using to make those decisions? And how should other institutions \u2013 governments, non-tech industries, global alliances, regulatory bodies \u2013 reign in the worst excesses of potentially dangerous AI innovators? OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, with an explicit mission to harness what may soon be superhuman intelligence \u201cto benefit humanity as a whole.\u201d But that sensibility hasn\u2019t lasted. The company now has a multi-billion-dollar for-profit arm. They have been developing new technologies at lightning speed, and sometimes sending them out to the public\u00a0before some employees believed they were ready. The company has already reportedly invented an AI technology so dangerous they will never release it \u2013 but they also\u00a0won\u2019t tell\u00a0reporters or the public exactly what it is. This dynamic \u2013 a potentially dangerous technology developed at extreme speed, largely behind closed doors \u2013 is partly to blame for Altman\u2019s firing. The OpenAI board, according to\u00a0CNN\u2019s David Goldman, worried that \u201cthe company was making the technological equivalent of a nuclear bomb, and its caretaker, Sam Altman, was moving so fast that he risked a global catastrophe.\u201d At particular issue seemed to be Altman\u2019s efforts to make the tools behind ChatGPT available to anyone who wanted to make their own version of the chatbot. This could be widely disastrous, some board members worried. But then they fired him without warning, and apparently without involving Microsoft, the company\u2019s largest shareholder. Now, Altman is at the new AI group at Microsoft, and one has to wonder if the oversight and caution there will be on par with that at OpenAI, or if he\u2019ll be handed carte blanche to push as fast and hard as he wants. And for all the justified reticence of the OpenAI board, the company has carried out much of its work in secrecy \u2013 without the public really understanding what a handful of unaccountable technologists are building, and how it is nearly guaranteed to indelibly change their lives. AI is broadly understood to have the potential to reshape vast swaths of human existence. At the very least, it seems nearly guaranteed to change how we process information, how we communicate, how we learn and how we work (and if we work). And the ramifications could be much more extreme. AI technologies have already demonstrated the ability\u00a0to lie and to cover their tracks. They have already been able to\u00a0suggest the design\u00a0to make a virus spread more quickly. Many researchers\u00a0acutely understand\u00a0just how quickly these machines could develop the capacity to annihilate us, including Altman: He has a prepper\u2019s paradise prepared in Big Sur, complete with guns and \u201cgas masks from the Israeli Defense Force\u201d in case AI goes off the rails and the robots go to war against humans,\u00a0according to reporting in the New Yorker. But don\u2019t worry, he told an Atlantic reporter: If AI is determined to wipe us out, \u201cno gas mask is helping anyone.\u201d (If you want an excellent and terrifying rundown of AI\u2019s risks \u2013 at least those we understand right now, which are almost certainly a mere sliver of the looming perils \u2013\u00a0the Atlantic profile of Altman and his technology\u00a0is worth a read). AI is very exciting technology. But it is also a potentially very dangerous one, and not in the social media sense of \u201cit may give us bad self-esteem and make us lonelier\u201d but in the sense of \u201cit could break down human societies and kill us all.\u201d Given the life-altering potential of AI \u2013 that even if it doesn\u2019t kill us all, it will almost certainly change human existence in unprecedented ways at unprecedented speed \u2013 we all have a stake in how it\u2019s being developed. And yet the development is being left to a handful of people (who seem to be\u00a0largely\u00a0men) in Silicon Valley, and other tech pockets around the globe. And we all have a stake in whose interests AI will serve \u2013 and right now, its development is being funded with billions of dollars by people expecting to make a huge profit. Do the interests of the public align with the interests of the shareholders to whom profit-driven, potentially tremendously lucrative-for-a-few companies are beholden? Or with the interests of tech entrepreneurs who are primarily excited about being at the forefront of the AI revolution, regardless of the potential human costs? One thing is clear: AI is coming. And how it is built and unleashed on the public matters more than perhaps any technology of the past century. It is, indeed, up there with the atom bomb in its destructive potential \u2013 except likely more difficult to regulate and control. \u201cRegulation\u201d does not begin to scratch the surface of what\u2019s needed to make sure that the AI future is not a catastrophic one, especially since the development of AI is now a massive international arms race, with particularly horrific implications if bad actors develop this technology first. But regulation is, at minimum, a necessary step. So is transparency: In the US, companies have wide leverage to work behind a veil of secrecy, and much of what AI companies do is kept secret to stymy competition. But the public certainly has a right to understand what life-altering technologies are set to be inflicted upon us, and what the creators are doing to protect humanity \u2013 our jobs, our communities, our families, our connections, our educations and our abilities to build a life of purpose, but also our lives and our safety. The Altman story is fascinating because Altman is the most powerful figure in AI technology, which in effect makes him one of the most powerful men in the world. But that should give us pause: Who is he, what power does he hold, what is he doing with it, who does he answer to, and are we comfortable with this much life-altering potential being held by a few unaccountable people?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/21/opinions/sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "business"}}

The average Wall Street bonus for 2023 was $176,500, according to estimates that will be released Tuesday morning by New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli. That\u2019s down 2% from the $180,000 recorded in 2022. Both those averages were well below the $240,000 paid out in 2021. That the average bonus was slightly down isn\u2019t surprising. Wall Street earnings last year were mixed, and merger and acquisition activity was underwhelming. \u201cWall Street\u2019s profits were up 1.8% in 2023, but firms have taken a more cautious approach to compensation and more employees have joined the securities industry, which accounts for the slight decline in the average bonus,\u201d DiNapoli said in a statement. Nevertheless, a little perspective: The average Wall Street bonus, which comes on top of the nearly half-a-million-dollar average Wall Street salary, was itself almost 2.5 times higher than the median US household income of $74,580, according to Census data for 2022. Wall Street bonuses and general employment in the securities industry provide vital revenue streams for the New York State and New York City economies, accounting most recently for 27% of the state\u2019s tax collections and 7% of city tax revenue, according to DiNapoli\u2019s office. The securities industry \ufeffin the city employed roughly 198,500 people last year, up from 191,600 the year before. And DiNapoli estimates that 1 in 11 of the city\u2019s jobs are either directly or indirectly associated with the industry. The total estimated bonus pool for 2023 was\u00a0slightly lower than the year before and is\u00a0projected to bring in $4 million less in state income tax revenue and $2 million less for the city revenue than bonuses in 2022 did. Still, DiNapoli noted, \u201cWhile these bonuses affect income tax revenues for the state and city, both budgeted for larger declines so the impact on projected revenues should be limited.\u201d It should be noted that the comptroller\u2019s numbers only reflect the bonuses paid to securities industry employees working for firms based in New York City. Beyond bringing in tax revenue for government coffers, Wall Street workers contribute substantially to the local Gotham economy. DiNapoli said that more employees in financial services (65%) are working in-office on any given day compared to 58% working in other industries in the city, at least as of September 2023. And that securities industry employees use the subway more than other workers in the city. All in, he estimates that Wall Street is responsible for roughly 14% of economic activity in the city.

On Wednesday, FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel called on other agency commissioners to support such regulations amid growing fears that AI-generated deepfakes could disrupt elections. \u201cAs artificial intelligence tools become more accessible, the Commission wants to make sure consumers are fully informed when the technology is used,\u201d Rosenworcel said in a news release.\u00a0\u201cToday, I\u2019ve shared with my colleagues a proposal that makes clear consumers have a right to know when AI tools are being used in the political ads they see, and I hope they swiftly act on this issue.\u201d Wednesday\u2019s proposal aims to open a rulemaking process at the FCC that would likely take months to play out. The proposal calls for new rules governing broadcast TV and radio, as well as cable and satellite providers. Under the proposed rules, political advertisers on those mediums would have to make on-air disclosures if their ads contain AI-generated content. The FCC does not regulate internet-based media such as streaming video services or social media. As part of the proposed rule, political advertisers would also have to provide written disclosures in the files that broadcasters are\u00a0required to make available\u00a0to the public. The FCC move seeks to fill\u00a0a yawning gap\u00a0in the regulation of artificial intelligence in political advertising. Existing US election law prohibits campaigns from \u201cfraudulently misrepresenting other candidates or political parties,\u201d but whether this prohibition extends to AI-generated content is an open question. Last summer,\u00a0Republicans on the Federal Election Commission blocked\u00a0a move that could have made clear the law extended to AI-created depictions; the FEC has since agreed to revive the discussion, but it has not reached a decision on the matter. In the meantime, some US lawmakers have proposed legislation that could clamp down on AI in elections. In March, a bipartisan proposal by Minnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski unveiled the\u00a0AI Transparency in Elections Act, which could require AI disclaimers on political ads. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York, has stressed the urgent need for Congress to create guardrails for artificial intelligence, particularly for elections. Last week, he and a bipartisan group of senators\u00a0released a blueprint\u00a0for legislative action. But many\u00a0policy analysts doubt\u00a0that Congress can pass meaningful AI legislation during an election year. Online platforms such as Meta have taken their own steps to address AI in political ads,\u00a0requiring campaigns\u00a0to disclose the use of deepfakes and banning the use of its\u00a0in-house generative AI tools\u00a0for political advertising.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/tech/fcc-weighs-ai-rules-political-ads/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_22_media_ronna-mcdaniel-nbc", "text": "NBC News on Friday announced that it had hired Ronna McDaniel, the former Republican National Committee chair who has repeatedly\u00a0attacked the network and its journalists,\u00a0assailed the\u00a0news\u00a0media as \u201cfake news\u201d and promoted false claims around the 2020\u00a0vote,\u00a0as an on-air commentator\u00a0ahead of the 2024 presidential election. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be a more important moment to have a voice like Ronna\u2019s on the team,\u201d Carrie Budoff Brown, senior vice president of politics at NBC News, said in a memo\u00a0to staff. McDaniel exited the RNC earlier this month after leading the organization since 2016. During her time as chair, McDaniel repeatedly attacked the press, which has become increasingly popular in Republican circles over the last several years as Donald Trump demonizes journalists and news institutions. McDaniel echoed many such attacks, labeling the press as \u201cfake news\u201d and calling the media \u201ccorrupt.\u201d At times, she even targeted NBC News\u00a0and MSNBC\u00a0with dishonest attacks. In 2019, for instance, McDaniel accused Richard Engel, NBC News\u2019 chief foreign correspondent, of \u201cactively cheering for an economic downturn.\u201d \u201cHow can NBC let him keep his job when he\u2019s made his bias so clear?\u201d McDaniel asked. McDaniel has a lengthier history attacking the progressive cable news channel MSNBC, which she will appear on in her new role. In recent years, she has repeatedly attacked the channel for \u201cspreading lies\u201d and blasted those she described as the network\u2019s \u201cprimetime propagandists.\u201d An NBC spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment about her attacks on the news media and NBC. In her role as RNC chief, McDaniel also fanned the flames of election denialism after the 2020 presidential contest. McDaniel was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d The Michigan Department of State\u2019s office condemned her claims of supposed voter fraud in the wake of the election, stating they had \u201cno merit.\u201d\u00a0The state\u2019s \u201celections were conducted fairly, effectively and transparently and are an accurate reflection of the will of Michigan voters,\u201d it said in a\u00a0detailed fact check\u00a0posted online. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Chris Wallace last year, McDaniel defended her claims of voting \u201cirregularity\u201d in the election. \u201cI think saying that there were problems with 2020 is very real. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s election denying,\u201d McDaniel told Wallace. \u201cI\u2019m from Wayne County. We had a woman send a note saying I\u2019m being told to backdate ballots. We had to look into that. That\u2019s deeply concerning. When you have friends who are poll-watching and being kicked out, that\u2019s deeply concerning. We have every right to look at that.\u201d In the interview,\u00a0Wallace pressed McDaniel if she believed Biden legitimately won the election. \u201cI think there were lots of problems with 2020. Ultimately, he won the election\u00a0but there were lots of problems with the 2020 election,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think he won it fair. I don\u2019t. I\u2019m not going to say that.\u201d NBC\u2019s hiring of McDaniel, however, plays into a recent trend at the\u00a0network\u2019s outlets, which has seemingly softened its stance on Trump as he inches toward the Republican nomination for president. Earlier this month, CNBC hosted Trump for a lengthy phone interview in which the network\u2019s anchors allowed him to peddle lies and conspiracy theories on air\u00a0without scrutiny. MSNBC has even started carrying Trump\u2019s remarks live on television, a practice that the network boasted for years it would not do. Star host Rachel Maddow, who has said carrying Trump\u2019s lies\u00a0on the air\u00a0is dangerous, even objected to the network broadcasting a recent speech from the presumptive Republican nominee, calling it \u201cirresponsible.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/22/media/ronna-mcdaniel-nbc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_media_nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash", "text": "Cesar Conde has a decision to make \u2014 and it\u2019s not an especially difficult one. The NBCUniversal News Group chair is facing a torrent of backlash from his own staff after greenlighting the hire of former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel as a paid network contributor. Over the last 24 hours, the most prominent and recognizable NBC News and MSNBC personalities have voiced strong displeasure with the company\u2019s decision to welcome McDaniel to \u201cthe team.\u201d And they\u2019re not doing it via anonymous comments to the press. They\u2019re doing it on the record on NBCU\u2019s own air. Chuck Todd broke the dam on Sunday\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with a set of candid comments about the hiring, and Rachel Maddow capped the flood of backlash Monday night with a blistering 30-minute monologue eviscerating the network\u2019s leadership for the \u201cinexplicable\u201d move. Suffice to say, NBCU News Group is in unprecedented territory. Never has a network\u2019s C-suite ever been so thoroughly flogged by its most high-profile stars in such no holds barred fashion. Saying that Conde simply has a crisis on his hands would be a contender for understatement of the year. It\u2019s a five-alarm fire at NBCU News Group, and one of Conde\u2019s own making. While NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown were most directly responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring, a decision that MSNBC boss Rashida Jones did not object to it at the time, the buck ultimately stops with Conde, who hold the real power at the Peacock Network. McDaniel\u2019s hiring could not have happened without Conde\u2019s blessing. It does not take a brilliant political mind with prescient foresight to understand that hiring McDaniel would ignite a firestorm of outrage \u2014 from both within 30 Rock and outside it. Conde, someone who ostensibly supports American democracy, should have rejected McDaniel\u2019s hiring on the grounds that NBCU News Group could not put someone on its payroll who tried to subvert the 2020 vote. As so many of NBCU\u2019s staffers have underscored, the objection to McDaniel is not that she is a Republican. It\u2019s not even that she is a Donald Trump-supporting Republican. It\u2019s that she was an active participant in the plot to overthrow the last presidential election. That is not to even mention McDaniel\u2019s years of demonizing the press, smearing the journalists who work at NBC News and MSNBC as she sought to destroy the credibility of the organization that she ran to after being chased out of the RNC. The notion put forward by NBC that it needed to hire McDaniel to bring its viewers \u201can insider\u2019s perspective on national politics and the future of the Republican Party\u201d is absurd. If that\u2019s the case, the network should move to hire free agents like Tucker Carlson or Candace Owens. They too have their hands on the pulse of the Republican Party. In fact, they represent much more of where the GOP stands today than McDaniel. So, using NBC\u2019s logic, why not hire them? (Spoiler: News organizations rightfully have established basic standards for paid contributors. Asking that your employees have a commitment to democracy, to the truth, and to basic decency is not a big ask.) But even if Conde has no allegiance to basic democratic principles, which this hire calls into question, given that he is known to be a political player who cares deeply about his own image in the press, he should have been wise enough to foresee that hiring McDaniel would be an ill-conceived move. How this did not occur to Conde is unfathomable and shows a tremendous lack of judgment. Even more bizarre is Conde\u2019s management, or lack thereof, since the controversy erupted. It was clear early on that his employees at NBC News and MSNBC did not support McDaniel\u2019s hiring. If that was not evident on Friday, it was clear as day on Sunday after \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d The network\u2019s employees were not only flabbergasted and demoralized by the move, but absolutely enraged by it. At that point, the writing should have been on the wall for Conde \u2014 as it was for every other media executive that I have spoken with over the last 24 hours. It is evident that McDaniel has no real future as an NBC analyst and the decision to bring her on as a contributor will have to be reversed. After all, which NBC or MSNBC program is going to invite her on after all of this? The only real question for Conde after the Sunday morning scolding should have been how he chose to back out of the deal in the least painful way possible. To be fully honest, I very much expected a Sunday evening announcement from NBC, one that would have earned praise from the company\u2019s staff and quickly been swept away by the rush of Trump news Monday morning. But no such announcement came. Instead, Conde has allowed the mess to spiral absolutely out of control. MSNBC\u2019s top stars hammered the network\u2019s leadership throughout the day Monday over the hire. NBC News\u2019 Guild blasted Conde, saying in a statement that under him the company had quietly laid off employees over the last month and instead chosen to \u201cprioritize an election denier over its reporters.\u201d The already severe crisis was allowed to blossom into one of the worst corporate public relations catastrophes in recent memory. All the while, Conde has remained silent. I asked his spokesperson, Stephen Labaton, on Monday whether the NBCU News Group boss had any comment on the situation. Does he have any regret? I didn\u2019t get an on-the-record response. Suffice to say, however, that what Conde does moving forward will say a lot about his character and commitment to democratic values. It will also say a lot about the NBCU News Group and what type of organization it is. In her biting monologue on Monday night, however, Maddow did offer Conde a way out of this mess. \u201cMistakes will be made,\u201d Maddow said.\u201dBut our resilience as a democracy is going to be recognizing when decisions are bad ones and reversing those bad decisions. Hearing legitimate criticism, responding to it, and correcting course. Not digging in. Not blaming others. Take a minute. Acknowledge that maybe it wasn\u2019t the right call.\u201d \u201cIt is a sign of strength, not weakness, to acknowledge when you are wrong,\u201d Maddow added. \u201cIt is a sign of strength. And our country needs us to be strong now.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/media/nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "business"}}

You can sign up\u00a0right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link. Americans with deep pockets have played a growing role in powering the US economy with their spending. But their days of splurging like there\u2019s no tomorrow might be coming to an end. US household wealth\u00a0surged in recent years, despite the scourge of high inflation and the Federal Reserve\u2019s bitter medicine of elevated borrowing costs to rein in price increases. A robust stock market coupled with rising home values have boosted Americans\u2019 wealth from 2019 through 2022, according to a Federal Reserve report on household finances. That increase is known as \u201cthe wealth effect,\u201d and it has continued to shore up Americans\u2019 finances as stocks\u00a0shatter records\u00a0and high bond yields beef up savings accounts. Plus, Americans who locked in a low mortgage rate before the Fed began to hike interest rates in 2022 and have decided to stay put\u00a0have been shielded\u00a0from the effects of high mortgage rates. Put together, that means many consumers have not only been able to withstand inflation, to a degree, but they\u2019ve also been able to spend on travel, concerts and big-ticket items. US economic growth accelerated at a brisk pace in 2023, largely thanks to the US consumer. And it\u2019s Americans older than 54 who hold the vast amount of household wealth in the US, more than 70%, according to Fed data. But the economy\u2019s momentum has slowed a bit recently with figures on\u00a0employment\u00a0and retail spending for April coming in weaker than expected. While the broader economy remains healthy, including the job market with sub-4% unemployment, there are signs that an important corner has been turned. The shifting behavior of wealthy Americans is one of them. \u201cIt\u2019s well known that the lowest income consumer is really struggling with inflation, but from a purely economic standpoint, it is the higher quintiles of earners that do the most spending,\u201d Nanette Abuhoff Jacobson, global investment strategist at Hartford Funds, told CNN. There\u2019s been some evidence of wealthy Americans growing cautious in the latest round of company earnings results. British luxury retailer Burberry reported last week that its profits plummeted by 40% in the budget year ending in late March. Sales in the Americas dropped off by 12% over the year. \u201cExecuting our plan against a backdrop of slowing luxury demand has been challenging,\u201d Jonathan Akeroyd, Burberry\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement. LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton reported in its latest earnings results last month that demand for high-end liquors has declined sharply in the US, leading to high inventory levels for the French luxury conglomerate\u2019s alcoholic beverages division. Walmart, which traditionally caters to lower and middle-income Americans, even reported last week that its gains last quarter were \u201cprimarily driven by upper-income households,\u201d or those making more than $100,000 a year. But the broader picture isn\u2019t all doom and gloom. It\u2019s been mixed: Royal Caribbean Cruises topped expectations for its first-quarter earnings results thanks to solid bookings and robust onboard spending. Demand for cruises, arguably an activity for the well-off, shows there isn\u2019t this mass retrenchment from rich Americans just yet. But some are thinking twice before swiping that card or clicking on the purchase button. Consumers overall have become more price sensitive, according to various examples in the Fed\u2019s periodic collection of anecdotes known as the Beige Book. \u201cWhen we talk to CEOs and CFOs, they\u2019re saying that people are pushing back, so companies now aren\u2019t feeling as comfortable pushing through price increases,\u201d said Jacobson of Hartford Funds. \u201cAnd company earnings in the consumer discretionary area are ones to continue to watch for signs of consumer stress.\u201d 1 in 7 Gen Z credit card users are \u2018maxed out\u2019 Ariel Barnes plunged into a credit card debt spiral in college, and a decade later she\u2019s yet to escape. Barnes, a manager of gift processing at Jackson State University, has maxed out seven credit cards and is struggling to make minimum payments on $30,000 of credit card debt. \u201cThe interest is so high that it\u2019s hard to get out of it,\u201d Barnes, who is 28 years old and lives in Jackson, Mississippi, told CNN in a phone interview on Thursday.Barnes is hardly alone. Roughly one in seven (15.3%) Gen Z credit card borrowers have maxed out their credit cards, according to new research from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. (The NY Fed defined Gen Z as borrowers born between 1995 and 2011, though others mark the cut off as 1996 or 1997). By comparison, just 4.8% of Baby Boomer borrowers and 9.6% of Gen Xers have maxed out their credit cards, which can be a sign of a severely tight cash-flow problem, my colleague Matt Egan reports.Read more here.

{"id": "2024_05_22_business_apple-china-price-cuts-618-festival", "text": "Apple is offering unprecedented price cuts in China as big brands and retailers launch promotions for the annual \u201c618\u201d shopping festival in the face of sluggish consumer demand. The hefty discounts by the iPhone maker come at a time when it is battling stiff competition from Chinese smartphone manufacturers, such as Huawei and Vivo, and declining market share in the world\u2019s second largest economy. On Monday, Apple said it would slash prices of some of its smartphones on Tmall \u2014 an Amazon-like site owned by Alibaba \u2014 by as much 23% till May 28. Customers can now get an iPhone 15 for 4,599 yuan ($639), down 1,400 yuan ($194) from the original price, according to promotions on Apple\u2019s official store on Tmall. Apple is hoping to boost its sales during China\u2019s second biggest online shopping bonanza of the year, which usually runs from late May to mid-June. The company did not respond to a request for comment. Launched by e-commerce firm JD.com in 2008, \u201c618\u201d is beaten only by Singles Day, which was created by Alibaba in 2009. Today, both festivals eclipse\u00a0Black Friday\u00a0and\u00a0Cyber Monday in terms of total sales, and all major Chinese e-commerce sites and many brick-and-mortar retailers offer weeks of promotions across their platforms to lure customers. Stars often get in on the act, too. Rihanna appeared in Shanghai Tuesday, making a popular Chinese breakfast crepe and hosting livestream sessions showcasing her Fenty Beauty products on Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok. While Apple has been slashing prices of its iPhone 15 models and iPads sold in China since October, the discounts this month are the biggest the company has ever offered in its biggest overseas market, according to Chinese state media. \u201cApple needs to aggressively defend market share [in China],\u201d said Jefferies analysts in a note on Tuesday. Apple\u2019s China market share slid to 15.7% in the first quarter of this year, compared to 19.7% a year earlier, according to data compiled by Counterpoint Research. Huawei, meanwhile, saw sales surge 70%, closing in its gap with Apple. After Monday\u2019s price reductions, Apple\u2019s iPhone 15 is now in the same price range as smartphones made by Xiaomi and Huawei. Boycotting the price war Smartphone makers aren\u2019t the only companies waging a price war in China. Almost every sector, from food and clothing to consumer electronics and cars, is offering big discounts reflecting a dramatic shift in consumption patterns in the country. The 618 shopping festival, a key barometer of consumption in the country, has seen growing competition by e-commerce sites and retailing brands to offer discounts. But the price cutting has become so brutal that some companies are boycotting the event. More than 50 book issued joint statements on Monday, saying that they would not participate in the this year\u2019s shopping festival because of aggressive pricing policies that required them to offer discounts of 20% to 30% on JD.com. One statement, issued by 10 publishing houses in Beijing, said the boycott was a necessary move to \u201cmaintain the stability and prosperity\u201d of the book publishing market. The other statement, published by 46 companies in Shanghai, said they were against \u201cdisorderly\u201d competition in the market. Even major state-owned publishing companies voiced opposition to \u201cchaotic\u201d price wars. \u201cWe hope there will be a wider resistance to the chaos of discounting, or more effective control,\u201d a subsidiary of Shanghai Century Publishing said Monday on its official account on Xiaohongshu, the country\u2019s Instagram-like social platform.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/business/apple-china-price-cuts-618-festival/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_18_business_retirement-plan-insurance-annuities", "text": "More Americans are turning 65 this year than ever before, and that number is set to creep even higher over the next few years. It\u2019s fueling a huge rollout of new retirement products \u2014 but they\u2019re not all golden tickets. An average of 11,200 Americans will reach that traditional retirement age each day in 2024, according to a recent report by the Alliance for Lifetime Income. This surge, along with new legislation that took effect recently, has led to a growing number of financial products that promise paychecks for life, no matter how long you live. But some options are difficult to reverse and, since some plans are so new, the benefits and shortfalls have not been thoroughly researched. From pensions to 401(k) plans Although she plans to stop working in about a decade, Jennifer Messina, a 51-year-old administrative assistant in Nutley, New Jersey, said she isn\u2019t worried about retirement because her husband\u2019s job affords them a union-sponsored annuity (an insurance product that pays out income) and a pension plan. With defined benefit pensions, the burden of saving and investing for retirement falls on the employer, not on employees. These plans generally offer employees payments for life, depending on that person\u2019s salary and how long they were with the company. \u201cI\u2019m really fortunate,\u201d Messina said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t really save much of anything.\u201d However, jobs offering pension plans are harder to come by compared to previous decades. Over the past 40 years, defined contribution plans, also known as 401(k) plans, have taken their place. Americans currently hold over $7 trillion in 401(k) plans, according to data from the Investment Company Institute, a trade association. These types of retirement plans put the job of saving and investing on the employee. With 401(k) plans, it\u2019s up to retirees to ensure they don\u2019t run out of money. Many people aren\u2019t able to save adequately for retirement so that potentially leaves them heavily reliant on the Social Security benefits they accrued in their working years \u2013 and those benefits aren\u2019t huge. The average retiree\u2019s monthly check this year is $1,915, according to the Social Security Administration. And even retirees with the highest earnings during their careers are getting somewhere between $2,710 and $4,873 depending on the age they are when they retire. In addition, millions of employees don\u2019t have access to a workplace savings plan or don\u2019t participate if they do. Nearly 50% of people don\u2019t have any money saved in a retirement account, according to Federal Reserve data from 2022. \u201cIt is structurally flawed,\u201d Teresa Ghilarducci, a labor economist and professor at The New School for Social Research, said of the 401(k) system. Financial companies are jumping in to fill the void However, this year has brought some changes to employer-sponsored plans. A new law, known as Secure Act 2.0, allows companies to now offer their employees access to lifetime annuity products in their 401(k)s. Enter financial companies offering new investments that echo the promise of a traditional pension: a paycheck you can count on for life. In April, BlackRock unveiled a new fund offering called LifePath Paycheck, which is a target-date retirement fund, which invests in less risky assets the closer you get to retirement. The new twist: It comes with an option to purchase annuities recommended by BlackRock. People who are in BlackRock\u2019s target date fund and elect to purchase an annuity through their workplace plan are not subject to the typical sales commission fees usually associated with buying an annuity. But they can only be in the fund if they have a managed account within their 401(k) plan and pay a management fee based on their assets. Nationwide is also offering a new target-date fund with an annuity option for 401(k) participants called Income America 5ForLife, although it\u2019s structured differently from BlackRock\u2019s product. By being in the fund you automatically will get annuity payments in retirement and those payments will be based on 5% of your balance when you retire. The product promises to continue paying that amount, even if you outlive the account\u2019s balance. Unlike a traditional annuity, you can pull your money out of the plan without penalty if you no longer wish to receive annuity payments. \u201cThis is a whole new burgeoning segment,\u201d Eric Stevenson, Nationwide\u2019s president of retirement solutions, told CNN. \u201cThis isn\u2019t your father\u2019s annuity.\u201d What are the downsides? Both products can be used with tax-deferred 401k savings or after-tax Roth 401(k) savings. For now, they are only available to employees at companies that offer them and only if they have managed accounts within the workplace savings plan. Ghilarducci cautioned that these products won\u2019t be free. And she advised that, when possible, retirees should opt to manage their savings on their own. \u201cThen you\u2019re not subject to any fees and you\u2019re not paying somebody else\u2019s profits,\u201d she said.  But for retirees looking for a guarantee that they won\u2019t run out of money, some of these new offerings may be appealing. There may be other downsides, however: As with other annuities, the monthly paychecks you get may be smaller if you elect to pass the benefit on to your spouse after you pass away, and annuities generally don\u2019t allow payments to pass on to children without incurring an additional cost. And annuities can be confusing to navigate \u2014 and with many it is difficult to remove your money after you\u2019re locked in. There\u2019s also the issue of inflation. Annuities do not necessarily offer inflation-adjusted payments, which means the value of your guaranteed paycheck will decline over time as you get older. In other words, it\u2019s always buyer beware. A steady paycheck, even one that emulates a traditional pension, might not be a perfect solution. Though she said she\u2019s not worried about her finances after retiring, Messina, the administrative assistant in New Jersey, conceded that she and her husband will likely have to downsize, even with the benefits of a pension and annuity. \u201cEven with the amount of money we\u2019ll be getting, we can\u2019t stay here in New Jersey,\u201d she said. Their next hurdle is deciding where to settle before they retire. Messina wants to relocate to South Carolina, while her husband wants to move to North Dakota.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/18/business/retirement-plan-insurance-annuities/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_tech_how-ai-and-bionics-are-helping-ukrainian-soldiers-return-to-action", "text": "Valera Kucherenko had already served a term in the Ukrainian army when Russia invaded in 2022. But he joined back up and, on a fateful October night in 2023, lost both hands in a grenade attack. It\u2019s a story that\u2019s\u00a0all too common for Ukrainian soldiers. Since the start of the war, an estimated 20,000 Ukrainians\u00a0have lost limbs.\u00a0Such injuries typically\u00a0end\u00a0military careers, but advancements\u00a0in bionics are\u00a0enabling\u00a0some veterans to resume what they see as their\u00a0duty. \u201cFor me, prosthetics were made in such a way that I\u2019m returning back to the army,\u201d Kucherenko\u00a0told CNN. Kucherenko was fitted with two bionic hands that are\u00a0new to the market.\u00a0The Esper Hand is the first product from Esper Bionics, a Ukrainian-US based company focused on next-generation\u00a0prosthetics. Artificial\u00a0Intelligence\u00a0is disrupting\u00a0many industries, but it is also offering up unprecedented solutions. In the field of bionic prosthetics, AI or machine learning can help\u00a0patients who\u2019ve lost limbs regain functions \u2013 and\u00a0perhaps even gain functions they\u00a0didn\u2019t\u00a0originally\u00a0have with human limbs. At least that\u2019s the hope of those at Esper. \u201cI think AI will be the next step in bionics,\u201d says Dima Gazda, CEO of Esper Bionics. Gazda, a physician and engineer from Ukraine, worked with his\u00a0team\u00a0for several years\u00a0to perfect the Esper Hand and says their systems have\u00a0been \u201cbuilt for AI since day one.\u201d In this bionic hand, AI helps the prosthetic\u00a0quickly\u00a0learn its user\u2019s behavior\u00a0and\u00a0choose hand grips the user\u00a0will need. \u201cIf I take cup from a table several times, tomorrow, the system will understand,\u201d says Gazda. The\u00a0AI-empowered\u00a0hand can also detect muscle activity. It\u2019s not just AI that is helping users regain their functions quicker. Bionic prosthetics are also being built more precisely to mimic human limbs. The Esper Hand has 6 different motors \u2013 one for each finger and two for the thumb. This allows\u00a0each finger to move separately. According to Esper Bionics, 70 Ukrainian soldiers are currently serving with Esper Hands, but the need greatly outnumbers the supply. Esper says there are currently around 170 people on the waitlist. With the fighting in Ukraine continuing every day, the number of those in need will continue to climb. Helping hand Inside an office complex about 20 minutes from Minneapolis is a clinic run by the non-profit\u00a0Protez Foundation. Every morning, a group of Ukrainian veterans gather\u00a0inside the clinic and go over the schedule for the day. Each one of the veterans is missing at least one limb, in some cases two to three. Their schedules will consist of prosthetic fittings and training. Those with prosthetic legs will practice walking; those with prosthetic hands, like Kucherenko, will practice movements like building with blocks. The clinic is run by Yakov Gradinar, the Protez Foundation\u2019s chief medical officer. Gradinar is a Ukrainian prosthetist living in Minnesota, who co-founded Protez a couple of months after the war started in 2022.\u00a0\u201cProtez\u201d\u00a0means\u00a0\u201cprosthetic\u201d\u00a0in Ukrainian. \u201cYou search for meaning in your life,\u201d Gradinar said. \u201cUkraine needed prosthetics, and I\u2019m a prosthetist. I can help.\u201d The Protez Foundation and Esper Bionics have partnered together through a special initiative to help Ukrainians. Esper Bionics sells the Esper Hand (which normally sell for around $20,000) to Protez at manufacturing costs, and then Protez\u00a0fits them to users for free. Gradinar has noted the speed with which veterans are adapting to the Esper Hands. His patient Valera Kucherenko \u2013 who lost both arms in that grenade attack \u2014 is now back in Ukraine with plans to re-join the army and train soldiers. The veterans\u2019 personal grit and motivation play a big role. But so too does the technology. \u201cWe often talk about negativity [around AI], but we don\u2019t talk about the part that technology can be adapting itself,\u201d the prosthetist says.\u00a0The hope is the technology will help bionic prosthetics get better and smarter. Esper is\u00a0currently working on a leg model and\u00a0an exoskeleton. The long view for Esper is health devices that\u00a0help all of humanity, but right now, there is a central focus on helping those in Ukraine. \u201cOur dedication is to help people who have the biggest need,\u201d Gazda said. \u201cI think by working together with the Protez Foundation, we are making Ukraine stronger.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/tech/how-ai-and-bionics-are-helping-ukrainian-soldiers-return-to-action/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "business"}}

For her performances, Dex is displayed on a video screen or as a holographic projection, with her mixes created by humans. She is animated using Unreal Engine \u2014 a 3D modeling software widely used in video games \u2014 combined with motion-capture.

According to CEO and founder Rob Sims, digital humans can help bridge the gap between AI technology and people. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve found is when people start working with and conversing with a digital human, they very quickly suspend disbelief,\u201d Sims tells CNN. \u201cIt becomes natural.\u201d AI explosion Since OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT was launched in November 2022, considerable hype has surrounded the potential of generative AI \u2014 artificial intelligence powered by huge datasets of information, capable of generating text outputs in a conversational way. Record levels of investment into generative AI have followed, with over $21 billion poured into the industry during the first nine months of last year, according to data insights company Pitchbook. In March 2023, Google launched Bard (recently renamed Gemini) and around the same time Anthropic released its AI assistant Claude. As generative AI chatbots become increasingly ubiquitous, Sum Vivas is one of several companies looking to make them more human. US and New Zealand-based UneeQ has developed animated conversational \u201cdigital humans\u201d that can be used as virtual sales reps and customer service agents on company websites, and this month it debuted Sama 2.0, an animated cabin crew member that answers questions on Qatar Airways\u2019 website and app. Microsoft recently announced that users of its Azure software would be able to create lifelike avatars capable of turning text prompts into animated speech. However, there are widespread concerns about the impact AI could have on the job market.  \u201cWhen we rely on automated tools, what skills are we losing in the process?\u201d asks Jennifer Ding, senior researcher at the Alan Turing Institute, the UK\u2019s national institute for data science and artificial intelligence. \u201cIn some ways, we think of AI as something that\u2019s helping us or augmenting our work,\u201d she says. \u201cHowever, alongside, this fear of replacement is bubbling up more and more.\u201d Harris, however, points to new opportunities within digital human design and development. \u201cEvery scenario that we found, we\u2019re creating jobs and working in harmony with people rather than taking away jobs,\u201d she says. \u201cDigital humans, first and foremost, should work with other human colleagues,\u201d adds Sims. \u201cWe\u2019ll move into a stage where digital humans will start to become just another member of the team, with added benefits for that team, and obviously the customers they serve.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/business/digital-humans-ai-dj-dex-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_18_business_college-graduations-pro-palestinian-protests", "text": "Universities across the United States have adopted a number of tactics in recent weeks to prevent disruptions by pro-Palestinian protesters at graduation ceremonies. Some universities have reached agreements with on-campus demonstrators, while others have cited safety concerns and canceled, postponed or relocated their schoolwide ceremonies. Several schools continue to grapple with pro-Palestinian protesters ahead of their spring commencement, subjecting themselves to internal scrutiny and public criticism. Protesters arrested at UPenn On Friday night, University of Pennsylvania police arrested 19 individuals, including seven students, following an attempt by pro-Palestinian demonstrators to occupy a university building, a\u00a0university spokesperson told CNN Saturday. Penn Against the Occupation announced their intention to occupy Fisher-Bennet Hall in\u00a0a post on the group\u2019s Instagram\u00a0Friday night, calling for people to \u201cflood UPenn for Palestine.\u201d The group called on the school\u2019s administration, in part, to divest from corporations \u201cthat profit from Israel\u2019s war on Gaza and occupation in Palestine and academically from Israel institutions, condemning the scholasticide of Palestinian scholars and universities,\u201d according to another Instagram post. Friday\u2019s arrests follow\u00a0the arrest of at least 33 people\u00a0on May 10 when law enforcement broke down a pro-Palestinian encampment erected on campus. The latest campus arrests also come just a few days before Monday\u2019s universitywide commencement ceremony, where students and their families will be subject to additional safety procedures\u00a0described as\u00a0\u201cairport-style security screening,\u201d the university said in a safety update earlier this month. Guests and graduates\u00a0will not be allowed\u00a0to bring signs, posters, flags and artificial noisemakers, according to school officials. UCLA and Sonoma State face internal division On Thursday, the Academic Senate at the University of California, Los Angeles rejected resolutions of no confidence and censure brought against Gene Block, the school\u2019s chancellor. The resolutions were brought forward in the\u00a0wake of an attack by counterprotesters\u00a0on an on-campus pro-Palestinian encampment on April 30, and claimed Block \u201cfailed to ensure the safety of our students and grievously mishandled\u201d the situation. The no-confidence resolution failed after only 43% of members voted in its favor. The resolution to censure failed to get the majority of votes required to pass by the senate. In all, 88 members voted in favor of the censure, while 88 opposed it, three abstained and 15 were present but didn\u2019t vote. \u201cIt is clear that we are not united in how we view the major events of the past weeks and the campus response to them,\u201d Chair Andrea M. Kasko said Friday in a statement. \u201cI hope that we can try to find common ground as colleagues, and have the courage to listen with open minds and open hearts even when we do not agree.\u201d Also Friday, Mildred Garc\u00eda, the chancellor of the California State University System, announced Sonoma State University President Mike Lee would be stepping down after he sent a message \u201cconcerning an agreement with campus protesters \u2026 sent without the appropriate approvals.\u201d The statement sent by Lee to the Sonoma State campus community on Tuesday included agreements to set up an advisory council of Students for Justice in Palestine as well as a review of the university\u2019s vendor contracts and investments, according to a copy of the message obtained by CNN. \u201cSSU will not pursue or engage in any study abroad programs, faculty exchanges, or other formal collaborations that are sponsored by, or represent, the Israeli state academic and research institutions,\u201d Lee wrote, adding study abroad programs in Israel will be \u201cterminated until further notice.\u201d On Wednesday, Garc\u00eda announced Lee had been placed on administrative leave for \u201cinsubordination.\u201d Morehouse threatens to shut down ceremony \u2018on the spot\u2019 In Atlanta, Morehouse College President David A. Thomas said he would shut down Sunday\u2019s commencement ceremonies \u201con the spot\u201d rather than allow police to remove student protesters during President Joe Biden\u2019s highly anticipated graduation speech. \u201cWhat we won\u2019t allow is disruptive behavior that prevents the ceremony or services from proceeding in a manner that those in attendance can partake and enjoy,\u201d Thomas told CNN\u2019s Victor Blackwell in an interview Thursday. \u201cSo, for example, prolonged shouting down of the president as he speaks. I have also made a decision that we will also not ask police to take individuals out of commencement in zip ties. If faced with the choice, I will cease the ceremonies on the spot If we were to reach that position.\u201d Biden\u2019s presence at Morehouse, one of the nation\u2019s preeminent historically Black colleges, comes as the president campaigns amid weak polling among young voters, even as many have expressed frustration with his administration\u2019s continued support of Israel\u2019s military campaign in Gaza.

The newspaper attributed the milestone to McCartney\u2019s longevity and continued appeal with fans across generational lines. Oh, and Beyonc\u00e9.

{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit", "text": "When Apple launched its first Mac computer in 1984, with its iconic Mac smiley-face \u201chello\u201d greeting, it wanted to differentiate itself in the fledgling PC market. The Mac was approachable with its friendly, innovative design \u2013 Apple\u2019s way of setting the Mac apart in the confusing PC landscape. That consumer-friendly mantra still exists today, with Apple carefully curating an easy-breezy yet controlled user experience across its products, including the billions of iPhones used around the world. But the Biden administration believes Apple took that too far. On Thursday, the Department of Justice sued Apple for illegally monopolizing the smartphone market. In a press conference, the government provided a long list of how Apple has allegedly squashed competition with restrictive app store terms, high fees and its \u201cwalled-garden\u201d approach, restricting how third-party companies interact with its brands and services. The company denied the lawsuit\u2019s allegations and said it plans to fight them. Apple added that the lawsuit could empower the government \u201cto take a heavy hand in designing people\u2019s technology.\u201d But if successful, the lawsuit could ripple across Apple\u2019s products and services. Although the suit could take years to play out, here\u2019s a closer look what it may eventually mean for iPhone users: Changes to the App Store If found liable, the company could be forced to change a number of things. One such change is how iPhone users could get greater access to \u201csuper apps\u201d that have been largely restricted before. The term refers to one-stop-shop apps that allow for messaging, ordering food, payment processing and other capabilities all within one platform.  According to Dipanjan Chatterjee, a principal analyst at market research firm Forrester, super apps most threaten Apple\u2019s preeminence in the lives of its customers. \u201cAn offering like WeChat, dubbed China\u2019s everything app, can provide an alternative to the Apple ecosystem for people to communicate, bank, share memories, talk to businesses and more,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cWhat Apple fears most is becoming irrelevant to its customers.\u201d At the same time, super apps like WeChat are created by larger companies and could, therefore, put some smaller companies at a disadvantage. And the concept hasn\u2019t been welcomed much in the US anyway. The US government, however, could argue that lack of interest may be due to Apple\u2019s high share of the smartphone market and its resistance to offer super apps in its store, Chatterjee said. Better interoperability Apple may also be required to offer more support for cross-platform messaging, an issue the company previously said it\u2019s already working on. The company lets iPhone users send high-quality photos and videos to one another, but similar texts to Android phones are slower and grainy. It also maintains those messages in green bubbles, creating a kind of class divide, critics argue. In November, the company said it will add new features, such as read receipts, typing indicators, better support for group chats and higher quality media sharing of images and videos, across platforms to help close the gap. Apple\u2019s move to add support for the standard called RCS (rich communication services) is intended to roll out later this year. RCS is considered the replacement to alternatives such as SMS, or short messaging service, and can work over both Wi-Fi and mobile data. The change followed pressure from both regulators and competitors to more seamlessly work across operating systems. The European Union\u2019s Digital Markets Act, for example, requires companies to make their key services interoperable between platforms. The US government could require the same. More open services Another likely change is how hardware from other companies, such as smartwatches, will interact with the Apple range of devices and software, including the iPhone and Apple\u2019s services like Fitness+. The company has also required Apple Watch users to own iOS devices as a way to keep them locked into its existing ecosystem. Chatterjee said making this change would have both positives and negatives. \u201cThe net result would reside somewhere along the spectrum of access to more and cheaper options but also the devaluation of the customer experience that is so highly prized by Apple\u2019s customers,\u201d he said. The Biden administration has also taken issue with Apple\u2019s lack of support for mobile cloud services. Loosening this could allow users to access games and other cloud-based apps without having to pay for pricey hardware. Inside the debate The DOJ lawsuit claims Apple\u2019s behavior has illegally hindered competition, kept its customers locked into its products and prevented other companies from innovating. Although the Biden administration will have to prove these harms, some critics say any potential changes Apple could make will negatively impact the user experience. David McQueen, a research director at ABI Research, said he recognizes that the content and applications market should be open, and Apple needs to avoid monopolistic advantages that can restrict competition, push up prices or block innovation. But Apple\u2019s success stems in part to its tight grip on its products and services, keeping things intuitive and seamless. \u201cIf Apple is forced to comply, it could potentially spell the end to the provision of this consistent and unified user experience, although by the same token, consumers will be open to a greater choice of apps and services, helping more developers and providers,\u201d McQueen said. Chatterjee noted some people are drawn to the Apple family of products precisely because of the carefully managed ecosystem\u2019s ease of use. Apple may have to work that much harder to preserve the integrity of its experience, but any changes probably won\u2019t be enough to make customers to leave and go elsewhere. \u201cThe vast majority of Apple customers would probably be happier with some more choice and lower prices as long as it did not hamper their levels of customer experience, which is threatened by the less control Apple has over the experience,\u201d Chatterjee said. But he added those currently outside of the Apple ecosystem will likely benefit by \u201cplugging in opportunistically without having to go all in with Apple.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_12_success_equal-pay-day-2024", "text": "March 12 marks Equal Pay Day in the United States, a symbolic date representing the number of days women have to work into the current year just to make the same amount of money men made in the prior one. Put another way, to make 12 months\u2019 worth of a man\u2019s median wages, a woman has to work about 14.5 months. In dollars and cents, for every dollar a man earns, a woman is paid 84 cents, according to the National Committee on Pay Equity and the Equal Pay Today campaign. That\u2019s based on earnings data for full-time, year-round workers from the US Census in 2022, which was the most recent full-year data set available. If part-time workers and those not employed year-round are included, the gender pay gap is worse, at 78 cents on the dollar, said Deborah Vagins, national campaign director of Equal Rights Advocates and director of Equal Pay Today. The size of the actual wage gap between men and women will widen or narrow depending on age, level of education, choice of occupation and tenure, as well as race and ethnicity. The gender pay gap is typically widest when comparing the earnings of White men to Black, Hispanic or Native American women. And, generally speaking, the gap is narrower in a given job when men and women are in their early- to mid-20s (i.e., when they are new to the workforce and before children come along), and also when comparing wages by title, tenure and education level within a given field. But no matter how you slice and dice the data, there are very few scenarios in which women on average earn the same as men. Indeed, in its latest analysis of median weekly earnings last year by occupation, the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research found that women earned less than men not only in all 20 of the largest occupations for men but also in all 20 of the largest occupations for women. Among the largest occupations for women, the most egregious pay gaps were among financial managers (women earned 71% of every dollar a man earns), retail salesperson (72%), education and child care administrators (79%), administrative assistants (80%) and managers (81%). The narrowest gap was among cashiers, where women almost have pay parity (98%) with their male colleagues. Same old (and annoying) story every year While the overall gender pay gap has been narrowing over time \u2014 for example, Equal Pay Day in 2005 was April 19, a full five weeks later than this year\u2019s \u2014 the very fact that \ufeffsuch a gap exists at all in 2024 is a reminder that employers and society still have work to do in recognizing the value of women\u2019s contributions at work. \u201cThe gender wage gap is a national disgrace,\u201d said\u00a0Jamila Taylor, IWPR\u2019s president and CEO, in a statement. \u201cEven in professions typically dominated by women, men earn more for doing the same job. Equal pay for equal work has been the law of the land for more than a half-century, yet\u00a0women still cannot get fair treatment when it comes to employment and earnings. And it\u2019s worse for women of color, who face rampant racial discrimination in the workforce in addition to ongoing pay inequities.\u201d The good news is that there are now multiple efforts that may over time help reduce the problem. They include an increasing number of state-level pay transparency laws and bans on employers asking job candidates for their salary histories, which can help chronically underpaid women gain more of an equal footing when they apply for new jobs. There is also now a ban on federal government agencies asking job candidates\u2019 for their salary history and a proposed rule that would prohibit federal contractors from doing the same, as well as requiring them to post in their job ads the pay for given positions. But Vagins and others in the campaign for equal pay also want to see action at the federal legislative level, supporting two bills: the Salary Transparency Act and the Paycheck Fairness Act, which have been introduced in the US House and Senate multiple times. For instance, the Paycheck Fairness Act would, according to Equal Pay Today, \u201cbar retaliation against workers who voluntarily discuss or disclose their wages; close loopholes that have allowed employers to pay women less than men for the same work \u2026 [and] ensure women can receive the same robust remedies for sex-based pay discrimination that are currently available to those subjected to discrimination based on race and ethnicity.\u201d Absent such federal laws requiring all employers to make equal pay more of an imperative, Vagins said, achieving true pay parity for women will be slow in coming.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/12/success/equal-pay-day-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_21_food_mar-jac-plant-poultry-death", "text": "Children have again been found working at a Mar-Jac Poultry slaughterhouse, according to the US Department of Labor. The latest discovery in Alabama comes less than a year after a teen worker was killed at a company facility in Mississippi. In a civil complaint filed May 7, the DOL said that investigators at its wage and hour division \u201cdiscovered oppressive child labor at [Mar-Jac\u2019s] poultry processing facility, namely children working on the kill floor deboning poultry and cutting carcasses.\u201d The complaint added that \u201cthe children had been working at the facility for months.\u201d Mar-Jac operates facilities in Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia. The DOL\u2019s recent allegation follows an incident last year in which a teen died at a Mar-Jac facility in Mississippi. According to Mar-Jac Poultry Alabama\u2019s website, \u201cMar-Jac Poultry does not sell to the general public, individual restaurants or convenience stores. We sell primarily to wholesale distributors and various national fast food establishments.\u201d It didn\u2019t list which fast food companies it supplied. A DOL spokesperson told CNN Tuesday that \u201cthe wage and hour division has multiple ongoing investigations of Mar-Jac plants in Alabama and Mississippi.\u201d Federal labor law bans children from certain jobs in slaughterhouses and meat packaging plants, including using or cleaning machinery, because of the hazardous conditions. In the May complaint, the Labor department said Mar-Jac had employed \u201cseveral minors under the age of 18 in the particularly hazardous occupations of working on the kill floor.\u201d The jobs included \u201changing poultry along fast-moving machine lines, de-boning poultry, and cutting poultry carcasses.\u201d The complaint added that products coming out of the facility through the end of the month are \u201ctainted by child labor,\u201d making them \u201chot goods\u201d under the Fair Labor Standards Act. That means Mar-Jac has been \u201cunjustly enriched, accruing substantial ill-gotten gains,\u201d by shipment of these goods in violation of labor law, the complaint said. \u201cMar-Jac will continue to vigorously defend itself and expects to prevail in this matter,\u201d according to a company statement sent to CNN. \u201cMar-Jac is committed to complying with all relevant laws, including but not limited to the child labor regulations, and already has taken affirmative steps to go beyond what the regulations require.\u201d The workers in question had given the company documents showing they were over 18, according to the statement, which noted that Mar-Jac has a policy against hiring minors. The allegations come after a 16-year-old worker was killed at a Mar-Jac processing plant in Mississippi in July. He was the second employee who died while working at the facility in just over two years. Mar-Jac Poultry told CNN at the time that the teen died from injuries suffered in what it described as an \u201caccident.\u201d The company added that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which reviews workplace injuries among other labor issues, was investigating the incident with the \u201cfull support and cooperation of the company.\u201d Earlier this year, the DOL proposed a $212,646 fine against the processor. When asked about the status of the request by CNN, the spokesperson said that the department can\u2019t offer further comment as its investigations are ongoing. The Labor Department has lately been trying to crack down on incidents of child labor, especially at meatpacking facilities. In February 2023, the Department of Labor and Health and Human Services said that they were increasing efforts to fight child labor. The DOL noted at the time that it had seen a 69% increase in the illegal employment of children by companies. A janitorial company was recently fined $649,000 after an investigation found it hired minors for dangerous jobs cleaning slaughterhouses. Fayette Janitorial Service had employed at least 24 children, including those as young as 13, according to the DOL investigation. The minors had been working overnight shifts at two separate slaughter facilities, according to the DOL. \u2014 CNN\u2019s Parija Kavilanz and Amy Simonson contributed to this report.

{"id": "2024_03_26_media_nbc-news-ousts-ronna-mcdaniel", "text": "NBC News on Tuesday ousted former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel, just days after her hiring as a paid political analyst sparked intense backlash from the network\u2019s top television anchors over McDaniel\u2019s role in subverting the 2020 election and attacks on the press. \u201cThere is no doubt that the last several days have been difficult for the News Group,\u201d NBCUniversal News Group President Cesar Conde said in a memo to staff. \u201cAfter listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor.\u201d \u201cI want to personally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down,\u201d Conde continued. \u201cWhile this was a collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team, I approved it and take full responsibility for it.\u201d Ahead of the network\u2019s decision, McDaniel spent the day Tuesday interviewing attorneys in preparation for a potential legal battle with NBC, a person familiar with the matter told CNN. Creative Artists Agency, the talent agency that brokered McDaniel\u2019s deal with NBC, also parted ways with her, the person said. The reversal comes after journalists and anchors at both NBC and its cable news sibling MSNBC publicly denounced the decision to hire McDaniel as a paid analyst in a stunning and unprecedented on-air rebuke of network brass that has embarrassed the Peacock Network. McDaniel, who recently stepped down from the RNC under pressure from former President Donald Trump, was involved in attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. As head of the RNC, she was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d In the years since, McDaniel continued to claim that the election had \u201cproblems\u201d and that Biden did not legitimately win the election, fanning the flames of election denialism. NBC\u2019s announcement Friday that it had hired McDaniel was quickly met with alarm by the network\u2019s journalists. The revolt spilled into public view on Sunday when McDaniel appeared on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with moderator Kristen Welker in her first interview since she was hired by the network. Welker disclosed that the interview had been scheduled to take place prior to NBC announcing McDaniel would become a paid contributor for the network, stating that she had no involvement in her hiring. Following the interview, Chuck Todd, NBC News\u2019 chief political analyst, delivered a stinging on-air criticism of NBC executives for their decision to hire McDaniel, telling Welker, \u201cI think our bosses owe you an apology for putting you in this situation.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a reason a lot of journalists at NBC News are uncomfortable with this,\u201d Todd said, explaining that under McDaniel, the RNC engaged in \u201cgaslighting\u201d and \u201ccharacter assassination\u201d when dealing with the news media. The following day, MSNBC hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough joined Todd in protesting the decision on their program \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d \u201cTo be clear, we believe NBC News should seek out conservative Republican voices to provide balance in their election coverage, but it should be conservative Republicans, not a person who used her position of power to be an anti-democracy election denier,\u201d\u00a0Brzezinski said. \u201cWe hope NBC will reconsider its decision. It goes without saying that she will not be a guest on \u2018Morning Joe\u2019 in her capacity as a paid contributor.\u201d Nicolle Wallace, host of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cDeadline: White House,\u201d later joined in the rebuke, saying on her program that the network\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel was nothing short of a potential threat to democracy. \u201cNBC News is, either wittingly or unwittingly, teaching election deniers that what they can do stretches well beyond appearing on our air and interviews to peddle lies about the sanctity and integrity of our elections,\u201d Wallace told viewers. Rachel Maddow \u2014 the network\u2019s biggest star \u2014 later devoted the first half-hour of her prime-time program to the controversy, saying the decision to hire McDaniel was \u201cinexplicable.\u201d Maddow took issue with McDaniel\u2019s long track record of demonizing the news media, labeling the press as \u201cfake news,\u201d and launching ugly attacks on NBC News journalists and MSNBC hosts. \u201cWe do not take it personally when we get attacked, when they say they want to put us on trial and execute us for treason,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so I want to associate myself with all my colleagues at MSNBC and NBC News who have voiced loud and principled objections to our company for putting on the payroll someone who hasn\u2019t just attacked us as journalists, but someone who is part of an ongoing project to get rid of our system of government,\u201d she said of McDaniel. \u201cSomeone who is still trying to convince Americans that this election stuff doesn\u2019t really work. That this last election wasn\u2019t a real result. That American elections are fraudulent.\u201c The on-air revolt ensnared NBC\u2019s top leaders, including NBCUniversal News Group chair Cesar Conde, NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown, who were responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring. MSNBC president Rashida Jones also did not object to the decision, people familiar with the matter said. In the wake of Conde\u2019s announcement to sever ties with McDaniel, MSNBC host Joy Reid and Maddow addressed the reversal on the network\u2019s air, praising the move as \u201cbold\u201d and \u201cstrong.\u201d \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/media/nbc-news-ousts-ronna-mcdaniel/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_ftc-tiktok-probe-privacy-and-security", "text": "The Federal Trade Commission is investigating TikTok for its data and security practices, two sources told CNN on the condition of anonymity. The probe is yet another complication for the social media platform, which is already facing the threat of a potential US ban or a forced divestment from its Chinese parent company. The sources said that the FTC is probing TikTok over an alleged violation of the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection rule, which requires companies to notify parents and obtain consent before collecting data from children under 13. The agency is also investigating whether TikTok violated a portion of the FTC Act that prohibits \u201cunfair or deceptive\u201d business practices, the sources said, in denying that TikTok user data could be accessed by individuals in China. The FTC could bring a suit against TikTok or settle with the company in the coming weeks, according to one of the sources. Politico reported news of the probe earlier. When asked about the investigation, FTC Director of Public Affairs Douglas Farrar replied: \u201cNo comment.\u201d TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The FTC probe comes as TikTok faces an existential threat in the US. Earlier this month, a bipartisan group in the US House of Representatives voted to pass a law forcing TikTok to be sold by ByteDance or face a ban from US app stores. The bill is now before the Senate, and President Joe Biden has said he would sign it if it gets to his desk. Senate leaders, however, have indicated they are taking a deliberate approach \u2014\u00a0which could lead to delays or even potentially doom the House bill. The short-form video company, owned by Chinese firm ByteDance, has denied assertions that its app poses a national security threat to US citizens. TikTok, which does not operate in China, has said that the Chinese government has never accessed US user data. Cybersecurity experts say Chinese laws require ByteDance to cooperate with that country\u2019s intelligence demands\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a fact that, given ByteDance\u2019s ownership of TikTok, could hypothetically put US user data at risk. To address that issue, TikTok has taken steps to store its US user data on cloud servers controlled by US tech giant Oracle and established internal protocols limiting access by non-US employees. TikTok acknowledged to Congress in 2022 that employees based in China could access US user data, following a report that year by BuzzFeed News that ByteDance employees had accessed that information on multiple occasions. TikTok CEO Shou Chew, in his first appearance before Congress last year, also acknowledged that several ByteDance employees were fired for spying on certain US journalists as part of a \u201cmisguided attempt\u201d to hunt down leakers within the company.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/ftc-tiktok-probe-privacy-and-security/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "business"}}
