Then, he was told the purchase might get him prison time.  \u201cThat was really shocking to me. It\u2019s just purchasing property,\u201d Bian, who is originally form Nanjing, China, said. \u201cOnce I learned that, I didn\u2019t even bother to look anymore.\u201d Bian, a 31-year-old software engineer who has lived in the US for 12 years, is a recipient of an H-1B visa, which allows companies to employ foreign workers. For nearly a year, however, it has been a crime for him to purchase a home in Florida after the state\u2019s governor, Ron DeSantis, signed a law restricting Chinese nationals without US green cards from purchasing property in the state. Bian and other Florida residents told CNN that the rules have fostered uneasiness and confusion among ethnic Chinese people living in the state. Some say the law has damaged their businesses, while others say they are considering abandoning Florida altogether. And the law underscores the heightened tensions between the two biggest economies in the world in a US presidential election year. Bian said that lately,\u00a0he had begun reconsidering his life in Florida. He isn\u2019t alone. Ever since Florida Senate Bill 264 went into effect on July 1, 2023, Chinese citizens without green cards face a felony charge and possible prison time if they purchase property in the state. Sellers and real estate agents can also be found liable under the law. \u201cWe feel like we\u2019re different from everyone else because of this type of law,\u201d said Echo King, a US citizen who was born in China and is president of the Florida Asian American Justice Alliance. \u201cWe feel like we\u2019re not welcome.\u201d  Chinese citizens barred from buying property in Florida Under SB 264, citizens of Russia, Iran, North Korea, Cuba, Venezuela and Syria are prohibited from buying property within 10 miles of any \u201cmilitary installation or critical infrastructure facility\u201d in Florida. For Chinese citizens without the permanent right to live in the US, specifically, the law goes a step further, barring the group from purchasing any property in the state. \u201cFlorida is taking action to stand against the United States\u2019 greatest geopolitical threat\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the Chinese Communist Party (CCP),\u201d DeSantis said in a statement last year. The law is currently being challenged in court, but several other states are considering similar laws. \u201cFlorida has gone far beyond what is necessary to combat the so-called CCP influence,\u201d said Clay Zhu, an attorney who has partnered with the American Civil Liberties Union to sue the state, challenging the law. \u201cWe think this is a form of discrimination based on race, based on national origin and based on visa status.\u201d Zhu likened the law to past discriminatory laws like the Chinese Exclusion Act. He says there should be a distinction made between the CCP and Chinese nationals. The law specifically bans the \u201cpurchase or acquisition of real property\u201d by \u201cany person who is domiciled in the People\u2019s Republic of China and who is not a citizen or lawful permanent resident of the United States.\u201d But the term \u201cdomiciled\u201d isn\u2019t fully defined in the law\u2019s language. Susan Li, a 47-year-old small business owner in Orlando, Florida, who holds a green card, said she \u201creally felt the discrimination\u201d when she learned about the bill. Like Bian, Li had been searching for a new home when the law passed. Despite the fact that she is a legal resident of the US, her family decided to halt their housing search for fear of potential legal complications. \u201cI thought maybe it\u2019s too much to bother, so I\u2019m not looking right now,\u201d she said. \u201cNo matter if I have a green card or I\u2019m a citizen, I still have a Chinese face.\u201d Heightened fears of Chinese government spying The controversial law comes at a time when relations between the US and China have grown increasingly tense. Last year, fears of the Chinese government spying in the US reached a fever pitch after a Chinese surveillance balloon was discovered over Montana and eventually shot down by the US. In addition to allegations that Chinese-owned apps like TikTok are used for spying (which TikTok denies), US lawmakers have increasingly warned that Chinese purchases of agricultural land pose a national security threat. According to the US Department of Agriculture, China owns 349,442 acres of agricultural and non-agricultural land in the US, representing slightly less than 1% of all foreign-held land in the US. \u201cThe Chinese Communist Party, a dangerous foreign adversary, should not own Virginia\u2019s farmland,\u201d Virginia Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin said on social media last year. \u201cThat\u2019s common sense.\u201d To Bian, accusations of spying are offensive. \u201cWe\u2019re ordinary people. We don\u2019t talk about these political things,\u201d he said. \u201cI think 99.99% of people here just want to have a good life.\u201d Fallout from SB 264 Teresa Jin, a mortgage lender in Florida, said she no longer works with clients who are not permanent residents or citizens of the US, but the grey area around the law\u2019s definition of \u201cdomiciled\u201d has created uncertainty. Other lenders have agreed to close on deals that she previously rejected for fear of legal repercussions. \u201cThe law has caused us so much confusion,\u201d she said. \u201cIt definitely hurts business.\u201d Zhu said that some mortgage lenders and brokers in Florida have even begun refusing to work with clients with Chinese passports \u2014 even if they are legal residents. \u201cPeople feel as if they are being treated as spies or agents of the Chinese government,\u201d Zhu said. \u201cIt\u2019s very unfair and also very un-American.\u201d Jin, who is a citizen, said she plans to stay in Florida. But others are weighing whether they might be more comfortable living in a different state without a law like SB 264 on the books. Li said she will likely leave Florida after her daughter goes off to college. Bian said he has hope that the law will be overturned, but if nothing has changed in a year or two, he plans to move back to California. \u201cI don\u2019t think California will ever have this kind of law.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/homes/florida-law-bans-chinese-citizens-buying-homes/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_21_opinions_sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic", "text": "The biggest tech news this week is the\u00a0ouster\u00a0of Sam Altman from his role as CEO of OpenAI, a move that has shaken the company and the industry. Hundreds of OpenAI employees have threatened to\u00a0resign. Altman has already\u00a0moved on\u00a0to a role at Microsoft. And OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is on its\u00a0third CEO\u00a0in as many days. It\u2019s all very juicy. But this drama should also be raising larger questions, far beyond one company\u2019s internal hirings and firings, including: Who are the people making the decisions\u00a0that will determine so much of our technological future? What guiding principles are they using to make those decisions? And how should other institutions \u2013 governments, non-tech industries, global alliances, regulatory bodies \u2013 reign in the worst excesses of potentially dangerous AI innovators? OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, with an explicit mission to harness what may soon be superhuman intelligence \u201cto benefit humanity as a whole.\u201d But that sensibility hasn\u2019t lasted. The company now has a multi-billion-dollar for-profit arm. They have been developing new technologies at lightning speed, and sometimes sending them out to the public\u00a0before some employees believed they were ready. The company has already reportedly invented an AI technology so dangerous they will never release it \u2013 but they also\u00a0won\u2019t tell\u00a0reporters or the public exactly what it is. This dynamic \u2013 a potentially dangerous technology developed at extreme speed, largely behind closed doors \u2013 is partly to blame for Altman\u2019s firing. The OpenAI board, according to\u00a0CNN\u2019s David Goldman, worried that \u201cthe company was making the technological equivalent of a nuclear bomb, and its caretaker, Sam Altman, was moving so fast that he risked a global catastrophe.\u201d At particular issue seemed to be Altman\u2019s efforts to make the tools behind ChatGPT available to anyone who wanted to make their own version of the chatbot. This could be widely disastrous, some board members worried. But then they fired him without warning, and apparently without involving Microsoft, the company\u2019s largest shareholder. Now, Altman is at the new AI group at Microsoft, and one has to wonder if the oversight and caution there will be on par with that at OpenAI, or if he\u2019ll be handed carte blanche to push as fast and hard as he wants. And for all the justified reticence of the OpenAI board, the company has carried out much of its work in secrecy \u2013 without the public really understanding what a handful of unaccountable technologists are building, and how it is nearly guaranteed to indelibly change their lives. AI is broadly understood to have the potential to reshape vast swaths of human existence. At the very least, it seems nearly guaranteed to change how we process information, how we communicate, how we learn and how we work (and if we work). And the ramifications could be much more extreme. AI technologies have already demonstrated the ability\u00a0to lie and to cover their tracks. They have already been able to\u00a0suggest the design\u00a0to make a virus spread more quickly. Many researchers\u00a0acutely understand\u00a0just how quickly these machines could develop the capacity to annihilate us, including Altman: He has a prepper\u2019s paradise prepared in Big Sur, complete with guns and \u201cgas masks from the Israeli Defense Force\u201d in case AI goes off the rails and the robots go to war against humans,\u00a0according to reporting in the New Yorker. But don\u2019t worry, he told an Atlantic reporter: If AI is determined to wipe us out, \u201cno gas mask is helping anyone.\u201d (If you want an excellent and terrifying rundown of AI\u2019s risks \u2013 at least those we understand right now, which are almost certainly a mere sliver of the looming perils \u2013\u00a0the Atlantic profile of Altman and his technology\u00a0is worth a read). AI is very exciting technology. But it is also a potentially very dangerous one, and not in the social media sense of \u201cit may give us bad self-esteem and make us lonelier\u201d but in the sense of \u201cit could break down human societies and kill us all.\u201d Given the life-altering potential of AI \u2013 that even if it doesn\u2019t kill us all, it will almost certainly change human existence in unprecedented ways at unprecedented speed \u2013 we all have a stake in how it\u2019s being developed. And yet the development is being left to a handful of people (who seem to be\u00a0largely\u00a0men) in Silicon Valley, and other tech pockets around the globe. And we all have a stake in whose interests AI will serve \u2013 and right now, its development is being funded with billions of dollars by people expecting to make a huge profit. Do the interests of the public align with the interests of the shareholders to whom profit-driven, potentially tremendously lucrative-for-a-few companies are beholden? Or with the interests of tech entrepreneurs who are primarily excited about being at the forefront of the AI revolution, regardless of the potential human costs? One thing is clear: AI is coming. And how it is built and unleashed on the public matters more than perhaps any technology of the past century. It is, indeed, up there with the atom bomb in its destructive potential \u2013 except likely more difficult to regulate and control. \u201cRegulation\u201d does not begin to scratch the surface of what\u2019s needed to make sure that the AI future is not a catastrophic one, especially since the development of AI is now a massive international arms race, with particularly horrific implications if bad actors develop this technology first. But regulation is, at minimum, a necessary step. So is transparency: In the US, companies have wide leverage to work behind a veil of secrecy, and much of what AI companies do is kept secret to stymy competition. But the public certainly has a right to understand what life-altering technologies are set to be inflicted upon us, and what the creators are doing to protect humanity \u2013 our jobs, our communities, our families, our connections, our educations and our abilities to build a life of purpose, but also our lives and our safety. The Altman story is fascinating because Altman is the most powerful figure in AI technology, which in effect makes him one of the most powerful men in the world. But that should give us pause: Who is he, what power does he hold, what is he doing with it, who does he answer to, and are we comfortable with this much life-altering potential being held by a few unaccountable people?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/21/opinions/sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_16_business_inside-out-2-summer-box-office", "text": "It was a weekend no doubt filled with Joy for Disney. The studio\u2019s latest animated film, \u201cInside Out 2,\u201d has rocked the lethargic summer box office, becoming the first movie of 2024 to reach $100 million in domestic sales during its opening weekend. Heading for a $155 million weekend per Comscore estimates, the movie marks the most lucrative box office opening since last July\u2019s \u201cBarbie,\u201d which grossed $162 million. According to Comscore and Disney, \u201cInside Out 2\u201d has also cinched the No. 2 spot for the all-time highest domestic animated three-day opening, lagging less than $30 million behind 2018\u2019s \u201cIncredibles 2.\u201d It also beat \u201cDune: Part 2\u201d as the highest-grossing opening of 2024 so far. \u201cThis performance came in well above our expectations,\u201d said Daniel Loria, editorial director at Box Office Pro, which collects sales and showtime\u00a0data from thousands of movie theaters across the United States. \u201cWe imagined it could \u2026 maybe match \u2018Toy Story 4\u2019s\u2019 $120 million opening weekend, but this result is absolutely extraordinary.\u201d Industry experts agree this weekend was a turning point for both Disney and the overall domestic box office. The summer has been off to a lukewarm start following a devastatingly low turnout Memorial Day weekend, which traditionally kicks off the season. Shawn Robbins, founder and owner of Box Office Theory, called this opening weekend a \u201cwell-earned victory lap for Disney, Pixar, and movie theaters.\u201d \u201cDisney is still in the early phases of its refocused theatrical prioritization,\u201d he said. \u201cTime will tell what original (intellectual property) can accomplish in the future and how consistently they can generate these types of performances again, but this is a major rebound for the parent company and for Pixar after a string of underperformers on both sides.\u201d In addition to production delays that have plagued studios as a result of the multi-month-long Writers Guild and SAG-AFTRA strikes last year, Disney\u2019s recent Marvel fare has been lackluster. \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine,\u201d the only Marvel property release this summer, is expected to reinvigorate audience enthusiasm after\u00a0\u201cThe Marvels\u201d disappointed last November\u00a0with a $47 million opening weekend. The third R-rated installment featuring the foul-mouthed anti-hero is set to hit theaters July 26. \u201cThe story of the summer was always going to come down to how Pixar (\u2018Inside Out 2\u2019) and Marvel (\u2018Deadpool & Wolverine\u2019) rebounded,\u201d said Loria. Domestic box office totals since the beginning of May are still down by about 28% compared to this time last year, according to Comscore data. But senior analyst Paul Dergarabedian said \u201cInside Out 2\u201d marks a \u201cmajor turning point\u201d for theaters, adding it only takes \u201cone or two overperforming films to change the entire narrative.\u201d \u201cThis the best possible news for Pixar, movie theatres and indeed rival studios whose own upcoming summer films (including the family friendly \u2018Despicable Me 4\u2019) will enjoy the tailwinds brought on by the amount of interest and increased foot traffic at the multiplex,\u201d Dergarabedian noted.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/16/business/inside-out-2-summer-box-office/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_12_success_equal-pay-day-2024", "text": "March 12 marks Equal Pay Day in the United States, a symbolic date representing the number of days women have to work into the current year just to make the same amount of money men made in the prior one. Put another way, to make 12 months\u2019 worth of a man\u2019s median wages, a woman has to work about 14.5 months. In dollars and cents, for every dollar a man earns, a woman is paid 84 cents, according to the National Committee on Pay Equity and the Equal Pay Today campaign. That\u2019s based on earnings data for full-time, year-round workers from the US Census in 2022, which was the most recent full-year data set available. If part-time workers and those not employed year-round are included, the gender pay gap is worse, at 78 cents on the dollar, said Deborah Vagins, national campaign director of Equal Rights Advocates and director of Equal Pay Today. The size of the actual wage gap between men and women will widen or narrow depending on age, level of education, choice of occupation and tenure, as well as race and ethnicity. The gender pay gap is typically widest when comparing the earnings of White men to Black, Hispanic or Native American women. And, generally speaking, the gap is narrower in a given job when men and women are in their early- to mid-20s (i.e., when they are new to the workforce and before children come along), and also when comparing wages by title, tenure and education level within a given field. But no matter how you slice and dice the data, there are very few scenarios in which women on average earn the same as men. Indeed, in its latest analysis of median weekly earnings last year by occupation, the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research found that women earned less than men not only in all 20 of the largest occupations for men but also in all 20 of the largest occupations for women. Among the largest occupations for women, the most egregious pay gaps were among financial managers (women earned 71% of every dollar a man earns), retail salesperson (72%), education and child care administrators (79%), administrative assistants (80%) and managers (81%). The narrowest gap was among cashiers, where women almost have pay parity (98%) with their male colleagues. Same old (and annoying) story every year While the overall gender pay gap has been narrowing over time \u2014 for example, Equal Pay Day in 2005 was April 19, a full five weeks later than this year\u2019s \u2014 the very fact that \ufeffsuch a gap exists at all in 2024 is a reminder that employers and society still have work to do in recognizing the value of women\u2019s contributions at work. \u201cThe gender wage gap is a national disgrace,\u201d said\u00a0Jamila Taylor, IWPR\u2019s president and CEO, in a statement. \u201cEven in professions typically dominated by women, men earn more for doing the same job. Equal pay for equal work has been the law of the land for more than a half-century, yet\u00a0women still cannot get fair treatment when it comes to employment and earnings. And it\u2019s worse for women of color, who face rampant racial discrimination in the workforce in addition to ongoing pay inequities.\u201d The good news is that there are now multiple efforts that may over time help reduce the problem. They include an increasing number of state-level pay transparency laws and bans on employers asking job candidates for their salary histories, which can help chronically underpaid women gain more of an equal footing when they apply for new jobs. There is also now a ban on federal government agencies asking job candidates\u2019 for their salary history and a proposed rule that would prohibit federal contractors from doing the same, as well as requiring them to post in their job ads the pay for given positions. But Vagins and others in the campaign for equal pay also want to see action at the federal legislative level, supporting two bills: the Salary Transparency Act and the Paycheck Fairness Act, which have been introduced in the US House and Senate multiple times. For instance, the Paycheck Fairness Act would, according to Equal Pay Today, \u201cbar retaliation against workers who voluntarily discuss or disclose their wages; close loopholes that have allowed employers to pay women less than men for the same work \u2026 [and] ensure women can receive the same robust remedies for sex-based pay discrimination that are currently available to those subjected to discrimination based on race and ethnicity.\u201d Absent such federal laws requiring all employers to make equal pay more of an imperative, Vagins said, achieving true pay parity for women will be slow in coming.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/12/success/equal-pay-day-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_03_27_media_nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over", "text": "Only 80 hours elapsed between NBC News announcing Ronna McDaniel as a paid contributor and the network ousting her from that very role. But for the leadership at NBC Universal News Group, those were 80\u00a0painful hours. On Tuesday evening, following another full day in which the media rumor mill churned at warp speed, NBCU News Group boss Cesar Conde sent staff a memo, notifying his troops that he had reversed his decision to welcome the former Republican National Committee chair to \u201cthe team.\u201d \u201cAfter listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor,\u201d Conde said, adding that he wanted to \u201cpersonally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down.\u201d Conde had no real choice. The embattled NBCU boss, who I\u2019m told dealt with the crisis from an unknown location outside of 30 Rock, was facing an unprecedented rebellion from his most high-profile stars, who one by one went on the air and excoriated leadership\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel. The only aspect of Conde\u2019s note that was surprising was the fact that it came 48 hours late, allowing what started off as a crisis to fester and balloon into one of the worst corporate public relations calamities in recent memory. \u201cWhat a sh*t show!\u201d a media executive exclaimed to me Tuesday shortly after Conde relieved McDaniel of her NBC News credentials. In his note, Conde said he took \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for McDaniel\u2019s hire. But, he also did point the finger, telling staffers that hiring her was \u201ca collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team.\u201d Indeed, multiple people familiar with the matter have told me that the infighting among NBC executives over who was at fault for the disaster has reached a fever pitch, with various factions of the NBCU News Group assigning blame to others. Regardless of who is to blame, the entire affair made clear who is actually in control of the company \u2014 and it\u2019s not Conde & Co. Despite the NBCU C-suite digging their heels in the sand as they resisted dumping McDaniel for days, they were ultimately forced to succumb to pressure from their talent. As a second media executive commented to me, it is now \u201cvery clear who is in charge\u201d after the \u201cweak leadership was put on full display.\u201d \u201cHas Cesar lost the room?\u201d wondered a third media executive. While the Peacock family argues over who was really at fault, the company is facing a fresh public relations mess. Led by Donald Trump, right-wing personalities are already assailing the network as being overrun with intolerant woke leftists. \u201cThese Radical Left Lunatics are CRAZY and the top people at NBC ARE WEAK,\u201d Trump raged on his Truth Social platform. Ari Fleischer, who served as press secretary under President George W. Bush, wrote on X: \u201cWhat NBC is saying is if you\u2019re for Trump, you don\u2019t belong. Good. Let NBC be for Democrats only.\u201d Of course, that narrative is intellectually dishonest. The objection to McDaniel from both within and outside of NBCU was not that she is a Republican. It wasn\u2019t even that she was a Trump-supporting Republican. No, the objection stemmed from the fact that McDaniel was an active participant in the plot to subvert the 2020 vote. And, in addition to that disgraceful history, she had a lengthy track record smearing NBC News and MSNBC. Nevertheless, NBCU will now have to contend with such dishonest attacks being leveled by the right, which will follow them in the days, months, and even years to come. As unfair as it may be, they will certainly damage the network\u2019s brand in Republican circles \u2014 a place it had gone through great pains to appeal to. NBCU will also have to grapple with McDaniel, who spent the last 24 hours or so interviewing lawyers as she gears up for a possible legal fight with the network, according to a person familiar with the matter. The rift between McDaniel and NBCU had grown to such an extent by Tuesday that she was not informed by network brass that she had been dismissed, I\u2019m told. Instead, McDaniel learned of her ouster in press reports. While NBCU is being beaten up on the right, the company\u2019s leadership was quickly praised by its journalists and top stars. Shortly after Conde sent out his memo, Rachel Maddow appeared on Joy Reid\u2019s show, where the two lauded Conde for reversing course. \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/27/media/nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "business"}}

You can sign up\u00a0right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link. Stocks are trading near record highs after Wall Street received long-awaited clarity on the path for inflation and interest rates. Can that last? The market has been on a tear in 2024, driven higher by robust corporate earnings and the artificial intelligence boom. That rally has been challenged in recent months by a slew of hotter-than-expected inflation reports and economic data, which spurred concerns that the Federal Reserve would wait longer than expected to cut rates. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indexes both clinched several record closes last week as cooler-than-expected May Consumer and Producer Price Index reports raised Wall Street\u2019s hopes that inflation is coming down again. Still, the Fed held interest rates steady on Wednesday and signaled just one cut for this year, fewer than the three it previously projected. Traders expect the Fed to begin easing rates in September at the earliest, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. If inflation is cooling down but the Fed is still expected to keep its key lending rate higher for longer, what does that mean for the stock market? Before the Bell spoke with Jack Janasiewicz, lead portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers Solutions, to discuss. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Before the Bell: What is your biggest takeaway from last week? Jack Janasiewicz: The bottom line \u2026 is that there\u2019s a disinflationary impulse coming. I think [Fed Chair Jerome] Powell was right to sort of look at [hotter-than-expected] January, February, March inflation data as maybe a little bit of an anomaly or a pause but not a reversal of that trend that\u2019s going to continue to head to that 2% target. So, again, heading in the right direction, it may be slower than people would like. But we\u2019re going to 2%. And then the other thing I would point to as well \u2014 the labor side of their mandate is becoming a little more focused. [The Fed] is one of the only central banks that has the dual mandate with price stability and full employment. It feels like the price stability side is coming into better focus. As the economy slows a little bit here, and you start to see the unemployment rate tick a little bit higher \u2026 the Fed [could start] to focus on making sure that the unemployment rate doesn\u2019t start to rise. That could be the trigger for rate cuts. So we\u2019re not ruling out rate cuts by September. We could easily have a cut. The data will tell us that, but I think the big takeaway for us is [inflation] going in the right direction. What is the implication for stocks? This is sort of a Goldilocks scenario for stocks where we\u2019ve got inflation trending lower, but it\u2019s still a little bit elevated above the target, which is going to be good for corporate profits, and the economy is still growing above trend. And even if we slow, keep in mind where we\u2019re starting from. You\u2019re starting from an above-trend growth rate. So if you slow maybe we slow to trend. That\u2019s a pretty good backdrop. That\u2019s good for corporate earnings. And that\u2019s, not surprisingly, why the market continues to hold up. I wouldn\u2019t be shocked if we get a pullback, but the underlying economy is still pretty strong, and we\u2019re basically going to tell our clients that any pullback, you should be looking to add on. So if we get a 5% or 10% correction in equities over the next month or two, you should be putting money to work, not de-risking here, because the fundamentals are still very strong for the economy. Do you expect some of the cash that\u2019s on the sidelines to enter the stock market? Some of that will come back in, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to see all of it, only because you\u2019re still earning a pretty good yield on money market accounts. People have cash as cash, and it\u2019s kind of its own bucket. So swapping that bucket for an equity risk, it\u2019s not quite the same. But I think some of that will find its way back into the markets. We still have plenty of clients that are pretty defensively positioned because they don\u2019t believe in this market rally, they think it\u2019s overhyped, the economy is still going to slow. So there is room for some of that money to come back in, but some of it I think is still pretty sticky. These cities are now so expensive they\u2019re considered \u2018impossibly unaffordable\u2019 Anyone with half an eye on the housing market over the last two decades will know that in many countries, not least the United States, it\u2019s become much more difficult to buy a home. But a new report sums up the feeling of many potential home buyers by creating a category that labels some major cities as \u201cimpossibly unaffordable,\u201d reports my colleague Hilary Whiteman. The report compared average incomes with average home prices. It found that pandemic-driven demand for homes with outside space, land use policies aimed at limiting urban sprawl, and investors piling into markets had sent prices soaring. US cities on the West Coast and Hawaii occupied five of the top 10 most unaffordable places, according to the annual Demographic International Housing Affordability report, which has been tracking house prices for 20 years. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the most expensive US cities to buy a home are in California, where San Jose, Los Angeles, San Francisco and San Diego have all made the top 10. The Hawaiian capital of Honolulu also rates a mention in sixth place of 94 major markets surveyed in eight countries. Australia is the only other country besides the US to dominate the \u201cimpossibly unaffordable\u201d list, led by Sydney and\u00a0the southern cities of Melbourne in Victoria and Adelaide in South Australia.

The complicated partnership between Apple and OpenAI When OpenAI CEO Sam Altman attended Apple\u2019s annual developer conference last week, he walked the campus, mingling with current and former executives, including Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak. Nearly an hour later, the iPhone maker announced a much-rumored partnership with OpenAI to bring its ChatGPT technology to devices this year. But Altman, who has emerged as the poster child for generative AI in the 18 months since the launch of ChatGPT, was not featured in Apple\u2019s formal presentation, neither in person nor via livestream, reports my colleague Samantha Murphy Kelly. Nor did he join Apple CEO Tim Cook and other executives in a private press event about privacy and security and the partnership between the two companies. \u201cI was not surprised Sam Altman did not appear on stage,\u201d said Ben Wood, an analyst at market research firm CCS Insight in an interview with CNN. \u201cApple had to manage the message carefully. OpenAI is merely the vehicle to address broader AI-powered inquiries that are not core to the Apple experience. Having him in the livestream would have only created an unnecessary level of confusion.\u201d Earlier last week, Apple showed off a handful of AI-powered features coming to the iPhone, iPad and Mac in the fall \u2014 the majority of which are fueled by the company\u2019s own proprietary technology, called Apple Intelligence. The company will offer OpenAI\u2019s viral ChatGPT tool in a limited capacity, usually only when Siri is activated and needs more assistance answering an inquiry. The move to invite Altman to the announcement but not have him appear before the public also represents in some ways how Apple is cautiously moving forward with the partnership.

{"id": "2024_06_15_business_why-do-small-trader-joes-bags-keep-going-viral", "text": "A few months ago, Thaddeus Yan heard that Trader Joe\u2019s was preparing to sell a fairly mundane new item: A miniature insulated cooler bag. Right away, he was on the lookout. When he went to London on a trip, he even deputized his mom to keep an eye out for the bags. After months of waiting, Yan drove to a Trader Joe\u2019s at 7:30 one morning this month and bought as many as he could, given the store\u2019s purchasing limit: Two in bright teal, and one in hot pink, both with prominent TJ\u2019s branding. Yan, a social media content creator, paid $3.99 for each of the small bags (too tiny for his Stanley cup, he noted in a TikTok video on his \u201cthaddybearz\u201d account \u2014 but big enough for a six pack). Others may not be so lucky. The mini-coolers have already been listed for several times that price on eBay. Yan is part of a throng of influencers who have been changing, and even accelerating, the way certain retail products go viral. They\u2019re not only rushing out to buy as many items as they can, but spreading the word on their popular social channels, where trends catch fire. Before social media, it took a lot more for a niche item to hit. \u201cYou\u2019d have to see people in public settings,\u201d so trends were much more localized, said Colin Campbell, an associate professor of marketing at the University of San Diego\u2019s Knauss business school. But now \u201cyou can have it all happen instantly across the whole country.\u201d Success strikes twice This isn\u2019t even the first time little Trader Joe\u2019s bags have gone viral. In March, shoppers went wild over Trader Joe\u2019s mini canvas tote bags, which rapidly sold out. Most brands don\u2019t see their products take off this way, especially not twice in a row. On those rare occasions, companies make hay: They talk to fans online and build new marketing campaigns, squeezing as much as possible out of that moment in the sun. But Trader Joe doesn\u2019t have much of a social media presence. The company staying (mostly) mum has allowed content creators, particularly on TikTok, to fill the vacuum, making the items \u2014\u00a0which may well have been popular on their own \u2014 even more successful. These creators are playing a key role in the worlds of retail marketing.  Talia Heskett, for example, has more than 134,000 followers on TikTok and about 146,000 on Instagram, plus roughly 68,000 on Facebook for her \u201cTrader Joe\u2019s Talia\u201d accounts, as of Friday. Because Trader Joe\u2019s doesn\u2019t boast much of an official online presence, \u201cI\u2019ve kind of taken on that role\u201d with those pages, she said. Heskett is a fan of the grocery chain, and has turned her interest in the brand into something lucrative. Her channels are popular enough for her to earn payment from TikTok. She\u2019s not the only one posting this type of content. Christy Vetere runs her own TikTok account, \u201cTrader Joe\u2019s and Target Finds,\u201d where she spotlights products from the stores. It had more than 54,000 followers on the social platform on Friday. Heskett, Vetere and others keep shoppers up to date on TJ\u2019s news, tapping into an existing audience of fans to bolster their own followings. What\u2019s up with these bags? Last March, when TJ\u2019s canvas mini totes went viral, the chain appeared baffled by their popularity. \u201cWhat is up with these tote bags? Like, they\u2019re a thing that we didn\u2019t plan for them to be,\u201d said Tara Miller, co-host of the company\u2019s Inside Trader Joe\u2019s podcast, in a March episode. \u201cI\u2019m still a little perplexed about how quickly that excitement went to kind of frenzy,\u201d she said. \u201cWe thought we bought enough of these mini canvas totes to last for several weeks, maybe a whole month,\u201d said Matt Sloan, who hosts the podcast with Miller. \u201cWe had no inkling that they would be this exciting, this quickly, for so many customers. We had actually hundreds of thousands of bags come in and go out within a week.\u201d This time, with the brightly colored coolers, the brand seemed more prepared. \u201cConsider yourself fairly warned: these Totes are totally destined to become the next craze!\u201d screams a product description on the grocery chain\u2019s site.  Apart from the prediction on its website, Trader Joe\u2019s hasn\u2019t said much about the swift-selling seasonal items. A Trader Joe\u2019s representative told CNN that the brand is always looking for new products its customers will like \u2014 and that it plans to offer more of the mini insulated bags this summer. How some products go viral If you search \u201cTrader Joe\u2019s mini insulated bag,\u201d right now you\u2019ll be served a seemingly endless stream of videos featuring the brightly colored items. Some people might just decide to pick one up on their next grocery trip because they saw it online. Others may seek the item out specifically, rushing to stores before they sell out. \u201cWhen you can get something that not everyone else has it makes you look cool, makes you look like an insider,\u201d said Jonah Berger, marketing professor at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School and author of \u201cContagious: Why Things Catch On.\u201d That desire doesn\u2019t only apply to high-priced or extremely rare luxury items, he noted. \u201cYou often see \u2026 trends and things catching on, or going viral, in what I would describe as low-cost public consumables,\u201d Berger said. Think Stanley cups, Owala water bottles and Nike socks \u2014 all items that can be seen in public. These items \u201ccan be affordable luxuries, and can allow people to either show their distinction or show that they\u2019re part of a certain group,\u201d Berger added. For some, the treasure hunt aspect may be part of the fun \u2014\u00a0especially when it ends not only with the coveted item, but a chance to post evidence of success online. Yan, who drove to Trader Joe\u2019s at 7:30 am to find the bags, doesn\u2019t run a Trader Joe\u2019s-focused account like Vetere and Heskett. His videos on Instagram and TikTok are mostly devoted to pop culture and Disney. But he likes the chain, and he likes to post about what he buys there. \u201cYou never know what they\u2019re going to drop, it could be some random, really cool thing that everyone might be interested\u201d in seeing, or getting for themselves, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s always a surprise.\u201d The chain\u2019s unusually loyal fanbase is eager for more Trader Joe\u2019s branded merchandise, TikToker Heskett said, but Trader Joe\u2019s doesn\u2019t offer much of that. \u201cYou can\u2019t buy a Trader Joe\u2019s hat, you can\u2019t buy a Trader Joe\u2019s sweatshirt,\u201d she said. That\u2019s why, she thinks, the branded bags have been such a hit. \u201cPeople want a little piece of Trader Joe\u2019s to carry around with them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/15/business/why-do-small-trader-joes-bags-keep-going-viral/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_business_amazon-contract-workers-file-legal-claims", "text": "More than 15,000 Amazon contract drivers filed arbitration claims against the e-commerce giant on Tuesday, alleging Amazon classified them as independent contractors instead of employees with minimum wage and overtime rights. Millions of Americans participate in the \u201cgig economy,\u201d freelancing work through delivery and ride apps like Lyft, Uber, Doordash and Instacart. But as gig work has gotten more popular, many of those workers say they are in fact employees, not just contractors, and therefore deserve more benefits and protections. The definition and rights of a contract worker versus an employee, for example, has been fiercely debated in laws such as California\u2019s Prop 22, which allows ride-hailing and delivery drivers to be treated as independent contractors with some added benefits, including a minimum earnings guarantee. Amazon Flex, launched in 2015, allows independent contractors to sign up to deliver Amazon packages. Flex drivers provide Amazon Fresh grocery deliveries or same-day deliveries from the company\u2019s warehouse hubs. Since the drivers are classified as independent contractors, these claims ask for compensation for unpaid wages and overtime, and reimbursement for expenses such as mileage and cell phone usage. Lawyers for the case said in a statement that about 450 such claims had been previously filed with the American Arbitration Association. Drivers from California, Massachusetts and Illinois filed claims because laws about employee misclassification are \u201cvery clear\u201d in those states, attorney Steven Tindall told CNN. The three states also allow workers to file claims for expense reimbursement from employers, Tindall added. Tindall and another attorney, Joseph Sellers, have been collecting claims for years, Tindall said. In a statement, Amazon said Flex \u201cgives individuals the opportunity to set their own schedule and be their own boss, while earning competitive pay. We hear from most of the Amazon Flex delivery partners that they love the flexibility of the program, and we\u2019re proud of the work they do on behalf of customers every day.\u201d\u00a0On its website, Amazon says most drivers earn between $18 to $25 an hour. In their statement, Tindall and Sellers said Amazon only pays the drivers for a pre-determined \u201cblock.\u201d If a Flex driver books a three-hour block on the app, they only get paid for three hours, even if deliveries come in that take more time. Amazon told CNN the majority of Amazon Flex delivery partners finish their delivery blocks early, according to its own data. Tindall told CNN that the workers filed independent arbitration claims instead of a class action lawsuit because drivers have to sign an agreement that forbids class action. \u201cArbitration, unfortunately, limits the drivers\u2019 pursuit of justice. So, we\u2019re left with little choice but to file almost 16,000 individual arbitration actions at once,\u201d Tindall said. CNN\u2019s Samantha Delouya contributed to this report.

{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk", "text": "In a year of wild tech stories that has seen Elon Musk transform Twitter, cryptocurrency exchange FTX collapse and Silicon Valley Bank implode, this week\u2019s whiplash-inducing turmoil at OpenAI is among the most captivating. Sam Altman \u2014 the leader of one of the world\u2019s most influential AI companies, OpenAI, and perhaps the\u00a0most visible figure in the fledgling industry \u2014 was fired Friday night by the startup\u2019s directors in a surprise move. Less than five days later, he\u2019s back as the company\u2019s CEO, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. The series of extraordinary events unfolded just days after OpenAI held its\u00a0first-ever developer conference, where it laid out new, commercialized versions of its technology, including the option to customize its ChatGPT AI chatbot. If you\u2019re just catching up, here\u2019s what you missed from a week so incredible you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking the script could have been written by an early version of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Friday Around 3 p.m. ET, Altman joined a Google Meet call with most of OpenAI\u2019s board that had been convened by fellow co-founder and OpenAI chief scientist\u00a0Ilya Sutskever, during which Altman was fired and told that the news would soon be made public. Within the next half hour, the board also informed Greg Brockman, another co-founder and OpenAI president, that he would be removed from the board. Around 3:30 p.m. ET, OpenAI publicly announced that it had fired Altman over concerns that he was not always truthful with the board. The board said Mira Murati, the company\u2019s chief technology officer, would become interim CEO. OpenAI\u2019s strategic partners, including its biggest financial backer Microsoft, were also reportedly informed of Altman\u2019s ouster just minutes before the board\u2019s announcement. Hours after being fired, Altman posted on X that he \u201cloved working with such talented people\u201d and that he would have \u201cmore to say about what\u2019s next later.\u201d Brockman promptly quit. \u201cPlease don\u2019t spend any time being concerned. We will be fine,\u201d Brockman\u00a0said in a Friday post\u00a0on X. \u201cGreater things coming soon.\u201d A key factor in the CEO\u2019s firing was\u00a0tension between Altman, who favored developing AI\u00a0more aggressively, and members of the OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the unfolding events. Saturday Within 24 hours of Altman being fired, reports emerged that he and other ex-OpenAI loyalists were mulling plans for their own venture. OpenAI\u2019s board was also reportedly having second thoughts and considering asking the ousted CEO to return. Sunday By Sunday afternoon, Altman was\u00a0back at OpenAI\u2019s headquarters\u00a0\u2014 this time with a guest badge \u2014 to negotiate his potential return. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reportedly mediated the discussion. A 5 p.m. PT deadline was reportedly set for the board to agree to Altman\u2019s demands, including adding a seat for Microsoft, and reinstating him as CEO. But those talks broke down. As Sunday turned into Monday, Nadella tweeted that Altman, along with Brockman, would join Microsoft to run a new AI research group. At OpenAI, the group found a new interim CEO: Emmett Shear, the former CEO of Amazon\u2019s streaming service, Twitch. Murati would return to her role as OpenAI\u2019s chief technology officer. Monday In a post on X early Monday, Shear, who left his role at Twitch in March, described the chance to join OpenAI as \u201ca once-in-a-lifetime\u201d opportunity. He added that the company would hire an independent investigator to report on what happened in the lead-up to Altman\u2019s firing. But OpenAI employees were not convinced. More than 500 staffers signed an open letter calling on the company\u2019s board to resign and reinstate Altman and Brockman. They also threatened to follow the co-founders to Microsoft if their demands were not met. Altman posted on X, saying, \u201cwe have more unity and commitment and focus than ever before. we are all going to work together some way or other, and i\u2019m so excited. one team, one mission.\u201d The drama was far from over.\u00a0The Verge reported Monday afternoon\u00a0that Altman and Brockman could still return to OpenAI if the board members who fired him resign. And Nadella, speaking to CNBC, said he was \u201copen to both options\u201d when asked whether Altman would actually join Microsoft. \u201cLook, that is for the OpenAI board and management and the employees to choose,\u201d Nadella said. \u201cWe chose to explicitly partner with OpenAI and we want to continue to do so, and obviously, that depends on the people of OpenAI staying there or coming to Microsoft.\u201d Tuesday Altman\u00a0was reinstated late Tuesday as OpenAI\u2019s CEO, the company said on X. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman\u00a0wrote\u00a0that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his\u00a0post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it has backed with billions to bolster its ambitions in developing AI. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Nadella\u00a0said\u00a0on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_17_business_boeing-ceo-calhoun-testimony", "text": "Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun plans to apologize for Boeing\u2019s recent safety failures in Senate testimony Tuesday and admit to problems with the company culture, but he\u2019ll push back on whistleblower claims that the company retaliated against those who brought safety issues to light. \u201cMuch has been said about Boeing\u2019s culture. We\u2019ve heard those concerns loud and clear,\u201d he will say in prepared remarks released by Boeing Monday afternoon. \u201cOur culture is far from perfect, but we are taking action and making progress. We understand the gravity, and we are committed to moving forward.\u201d The \u201cfar from perfect\u201d remark is a massive understatement. Boeing has been under intense scrutiny with numerous federal investigations and congressional hearings since a January 5 Alaska Air Boeing 737 Max flight had a door plug blow off, leaving a gaping hole in both the plane and Boeing\u2019s reputation. Boeing has been ordered by the Federal Aviation Administration to improve its safety issues before it can resume normal production, causing problems for airlines that can\u2019t get the planes they ordered. And that, in turn, has meant higher fares for passengers, who have had their faith the company\u2019s planes sorely tested. The hearing Tuesday by the Senate\u2019s permanent subcommittee on investigations is entitled \u201cBoeing\u2019s broken safety culture.\u201d It is just the latest congressional hearing this year about safety issues at Boeing but the first time Calhoun is testifying in his more than four years running the troubled company. He will be joined by Howard McKenzie, Boeing\u2019s chief engineer. At an April 17 hearing Boeing engineer Sam Salehpour testified that Boeing is putting out defective planes because he and others who complain faced pressure not to do so. \u201cI have serious concerns about the safety of the 787 and 777 aircraft, and I\u2019m willing to take on professional risk to talk about them,\u201d Salehpour said in his opening statement. He said when he raised concerns, \u201cI was ignored. I was told not to create delays. I was told, frankly, to shut up.\u201d Calhoun denies that is the case currently at Boeing in his prepared remarks. \u201cWe are committed to making sure every employee feels empowered to speak up if there is a problem,\u201d he\u2019ll say, according to the prepared remarks. \u201cWe also have strict policies in place to prohibit retaliation against employees who come forward. It is our job to listen, regardless of how we obtain feedback, and handle it with the seriousness it deserves.\u201d Will there be changes? Despite the attention the hearing is expected to garner, it\u2019s unlikely to produce significant change at the company, said Richard Aboulafia, managing partner for AeroDynamic Consultancy, an aerospace advisory firm. \u201cNothing has produced change (at Boeing) except frustration from a bunch of airline customers,\u201d said Aboulafia. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what will change as a consequence of this. He (Calhoun) needs to go. He has shown a strong desire to double down on what\u2019s bad.\u201d A preliminary investigation of the Alaska Air incident has found that the plane left a Boeing factory two months before the incident without the four bolts needed to hold the door plug in place. And Boeing has yet to produce the paperwork to identify who in the factory installed the door plug without the bolts. It has been harshly criticized by members of Congress and safety regulators and will likely face more criticism Tuesday. Calhoun has already met with members of Congress since the Alaska Air incident, albeit behind closed doors. He has also made numerous public statements to Boeing employees and to investors since the Alaska Air incident. \u201cWe caused the problem, and we understand that,\u201d he told investors in January during a call after reporting its fifth straight annual loss. \u201cWhatever conclusions (from the investigations) are reached, Boeing is accountable for what happened. Whatever the specific cause of the accident might turn out to be, an event like this simply must not happen on an airplane that leaves one of our factories. We simply must be better.\u201d Apologies to families, passengers Calhoun\u2019s prepared remarks begin with an apology to the family members of the victims of two fatal 737 Max crashes. Some of those family members plan to attend the hearing. Between them, 346 people were killed in the 2018 and 2019 crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia, leading to to a 20-month grounding of the jet to fix a design flaw that caused the crashes. \u201cWe are deeply sorry for your losses,\u201d he\u2019ll say in his opening comments. \u201cNothing is more important than the safety of the people who step on board our airplanes. Every day we seek to honor the memory of those lost.\u201d He also plans to again apologize to the passengers and crew of the Alaska Air flight in January. \u201cWe deeply regret the impact that the Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 accident had on Alaska Airlines\u2019 team and its passengers, and we are grateful to the pilots and crew for safely landing the plane,\u201d he\u2019ll say. \u201cWe are thankful that there were no fatalities.\u201d But experts say that it was sheer luck that no one was killed in the Alaska Air incident. This could very well be Calhoun\u2019s only time testifying on Capitol Hill. He has announced plans to retire before the end of this year. His successor has yet to be selected. Beyond Tuesday\u2019s hearing, and the numerous federal investigations it faces, the company could still face criminal liability from the original certification process of the 737 Max. In January of 2021 Boeing agreed to a probationary period, which deferred any prosecution on those charges and which would have exempted it from criminal liability in the crashes.

{"id": "2024_06_12_economy_consumer-price-index-inflation-may", "text": "Inflation cooled more than expected in May, new data showed Wednesday, delivering a welcome piece of news just hours before the Federal Reserve is set to make its latest announcement on interest rates. Consumer prices rose 3.3% from a year earlier, slowing from April\u2019s 3.4% rate, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 latest Consumer Price Index report released Wednesday. On a monthly basis, prices held flat for the first time since July 2022. Falling gas prices kept inflation in check following a 0.3% gain in April. \u201cThis is the best news we could\u2019ve gotten this morning,\u201d Philip T. Powell, executive director of the Indiana Business Research Center and clinical associate professor at the Indiana University Kelley School of Business, told CNN. \u201cThe Federal Reserve has been watching to make sure this [monthly] number came in below 0.2%.\u201d \u201cIf it did, that means inflation is going to come down, which means [the Fed] could lower interest rates,\u201d he added. Economists were expecting a 0.1% monthly increase and an annual gain of 3.4%, according to FactSet consensus estimates. Helping to slow inflation in May were falling gas prices, which dropped 3.6% from April. They\u2019re still up 2.2% for the year. Grocery prices were flat and overall food prices went up by 0.1%, lifted by a slight acceleration in inflation at the restaurant level. Car insurance and transportation prices fall, but housing inflation is stuck running high Excluding gas and food, categories that tend to be volatile, the closely watched \u201ccore\u201d measure rose just 0.2% for the month (its slowest pace since October of last year), and its annual rate dropped to 3.4%, setting a fresh three-year low. \u201cAdding to the good inflation news, core services inflation (excludes energy services) printed its mildest monthly increase since September 2021,\u201d Kathy Bostjancic, Nationwide\u2019s chief economist, wrote in a note issued Wednesday. \u201cThis is significant since core services inflation has been very sticky and the key reason overall inflation has not cooled more quickly.\u201d However, shelter inflation more than offset the decline in gasoline, rising 0.4% for the fourth month in a row, underscoring the pressure Americans are feeling from\u00a0housing-related expenses. On an annual basis, shelter inflation slowed a tenth of a percentage point to 5.4%, which is its lowest rate since April 2022. However, in addition to outpacing overall inflation, the cost of shelter is running above its pre-pandemic average and the 3.3% rate in February 2020. The shelter index, an abstruse measurement of housing costs, has been the thorn in the side of the Fed\u2019s desire to see overall inflation return to target. (That target, by the way, is based on a separate inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, which stayed pat at 2.7% in April.) Shelter\u2019s heavily weighted in the CPI, and while it doesn\u2019t fully reflect some of the slowdown seen in market-rate rents, its persistently high readings certainly do speak to the pain Americans are feeling in their biggest monthly expense. \u201cThe one thing that sticks out in these numbers is the continued struggle with housing affordability,\u201d Indiana University\u2019s Powell said. \u201cThere is so much pent-up demand out there for housing, it\u2019s not going to go away.\u201d Transportation services prices fell for the first time since the fall of 2021, dropping 0.5% for the month. And motor vehicle insurance prices ticked down by 0.1%, a sharp contrast from the spikes seen during the past two months. Still, those costs continue to run hot for consumers, with transportation services prices up 10.5% from a year ago and car insurance up 20.3%. \u201cThe big and important things that households spend their money on \u2014 food, transportation and shelter \u2014 there\u2019s not been a lot of relief there,\u201d Sean Snaith, University of Central Florida economist, told CNN. Soft CPI boosts chances for Fed cuts The CPI, which tracks average change in prices for a basket of goods and services common to consumers, is the most widely cited inflation metric. But on Wednesday, it was merely the opening act. The report landed just hours before the Fed was scheduled to wrap up its policymaking meeting, deliver its latest economic projections, and announce the next steps for interest rates. Although the softer CPI likely will be welcomed by central bankers, economists say it won\u2019t be enough to move the needle on interest rates, which are overwhelmingly expected to hold steady Wednesday (markets are seeing a mere 0.1% probability of a June cut). \u201cLogically, then, today\u2019s news would seem to open the door to a July rate cut, although we still think that\u2019s very unlikely given hawkish rhetoric from the Fed recently,\u201d Preston Caldwell, chief US economist at Morningstar, wrote Wednesday. \u201cBut rate cuts starting by September should now be cemented as overwhelmingly likely.\u201d Traders seem to agree: The latest projections from the CME FedWatch Tool had the likelihood of a September rate cut at nearly 63% on Wednesday morning, jumping from 46.8% Tuesday. The Fed on Wednesday is expected to tip its hand some with the release of the latest Summary of Economic Projections (SEP). The quarterly publication includes the central bankers\u2019 forecasts for key economic indicators such as inflation, GDP growth and unemployment as well as the \u201cdot plot,\u201d a chart of their expectations for interest rates. When the Fed released its prior SEP back in March, it showed the possibility of three cuts penciled in for the remainder of the year. Economists expect that number to drop, given that there are fewer months left on that runway and still fairly strong economic data touching down (be it the hotter-than-expected inflation reports to start the year or the stronger-than-expected job gains). \u201cThe CPI report for May came in a bit better than we dared hope for given the string of disappointing readings to start the year,\u201d Scott Anderson, chief US economist for BMO Bank, wrote in a note Wednesday. \u201cIf sustained, it will keep Fed rate-cut expectations that we have penciled in for September and December alive and well. Restrictive monetary policy has more work to do, and the Fed will remain patient and watchful.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/economy/consumer-price-index-inflation-may/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit", "text": "When Apple launched its first Mac computer in 1984, with its iconic Mac smiley-face \u201chello\u201d greeting, it wanted to differentiate itself in the fledgling PC market. The Mac was approachable with its friendly, innovative design \u2013 Apple\u2019s way of setting the Mac apart in the confusing PC landscape. That consumer-friendly mantra still exists today, with Apple carefully curating an easy-breezy yet controlled user experience across its products, including the billions of iPhones used around the world. But the Biden administration believes Apple took that too far. On Thursday, the Department of Justice sued Apple for illegally monopolizing the smartphone market. In a press conference, the government provided a long list of how Apple has allegedly squashed competition with restrictive app store terms, high fees and its \u201cwalled-garden\u201d approach, restricting how third-party companies interact with its brands and services. The company denied the lawsuit\u2019s allegations and said it plans to fight them. Apple added that the lawsuit could empower the government \u201cto take a heavy hand in designing people\u2019s technology.\u201d But if successful, the lawsuit could ripple across Apple\u2019s products and services. Although the suit could take years to play out, here\u2019s a closer look what it may eventually mean for iPhone users: Changes to the App Store If found liable, the company could be forced to change a number of things. One such change is how iPhone users could get greater access to \u201csuper apps\u201d that have been largely restricted before. The term refers to one-stop-shop apps that allow for messaging, ordering food, payment processing and other capabilities all within one platform.  According to Dipanjan Chatterjee, a principal analyst at market research firm Forrester, super apps most threaten Apple\u2019s preeminence in the lives of its customers. \u201cAn offering like WeChat, dubbed China\u2019s everything app, can provide an alternative to the Apple ecosystem for people to communicate, bank, share memories, talk to businesses and more,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cWhat Apple fears most is becoming irrelevant to its customers.\u201d At the same time, super apps like WeChat are created by larger companies and could, therefore, put some smaller companies at a disadvantage. And the concept hasn\u2019t been welcomed much in the US anyway. The US government, however, could argue that lack of interest may be due to Apple\u2019s high share of the smartphone market and its resistance to offer super apps in its store, Chatterjee said. Better interoperability Apple may also be required to offer more support for cross-platform messaging, an issue the company previously said it\u2019s already working on. The company lets iPhone users send high-quality photos and videos to one another, but similar texts to Android phones are slower and grainy. It also maintains those messages in green bubbles, creating a kind of class divide, critics argue. In November, the company said it will add new features, such as read receipts, typing indicators, better support for group chats and higher quality media sharing of images and videos, across platforms to help close the gap. Apple\u2019s move to add support for the standard called RCS (rich communication services) is intended to roll out later this year. RCS is considered the replacement to alternatives such as SMS, or short messaging service, and can work over both Wi-Fi and mobile data. The change followed pressure from both regulators and competitors to more seamlessly work across operating systems. The European Union\u2019s Digital Markets Act, for example, requires companies to make their key services interoperable between platforms. The US government could require the same. More open services Another likely change is how hardware from other companies, such as smartwatches, will interact with the Apple range of devices and software, including the iPhone and Apple\u2019s services like Fitness+. The company has also required Apple Watch users to own iOS devices as a way to keep them locked into its existing ecosystem. Chatterjee said making this change would have both positives and negatives. \u201cThe net result would reside somewhere along the spectrum of access to more and cheaper options but also the devaluation of the customer experience that is so highly prized by Apple\u2019s customers,\u201d he said. The Biden administration has also taken issue with Apple\u2019s lack of support for mobile cloud services. Loosening this could allow users to access games and other cloud-based apps without having to pay for pricey hardware. Inside the debate The DOJ lawsuit claims Apple\u2019s behavior has illegally hindered competition, kept its customers locked into its products and prevented other companies from innovating. Although the Biden administration will have to prove these harms, some critics say any potential changes Apple could make will negatively impact the user experience. David McQueen, a research director at ABI Research, said he recognizes that the content and applications market should be open, and Apple needs to avoid monopolistic advantages that can restrict competition, push up prices or block innovation. But Apple\u2019s success stems in part to its tight grip on its products and services, keeping things intuitive and seamless. \u201cIf Apple is forced to comply, it could potentially spell the end to the provision of this consistent and unified user experience, although by the same token, consumers will be open to a greater choice of apps and services, helping more developers and providers,\u201d McQueen said. Chatterjee noted some people are drawn to the Apple family of products precisely because of the carefully managed ecosystem\u2019s ease of use. Apple may have to work that much harder to preserve the integrity of its experience, but any changes probably won\u2019t be enough to make customers to leave and go elsewhere. \u201cThe vast majority of Apple customers would probably be happier with some more choice and lower prices as long as it did not hamper their levels of customer experience, which is threatened by the less control Apple has over the experience,\u201d Chatterjee said. But he added those currently outside of the Apple ecosystem will likely benefit by \u201cplugging in opportunistically without having to go all in with Apple.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_economy_june-fed-decision", "text": "The\u00a0Federal Reserve\u00a0said Wednesday it is keeping its benchmark lending rate at its current level for the seventh time in a row, while signaling fewer rate cuts than previously estimated. That means borrowing costs on everything from car loans to mortgage rates will remain elevated. Officials penciled in just one rate cut this year, according to their latest economic projections, compared to the three they forecast in March. They also expect\u00a0inflation\u00a0to be more stubborn this year than they thought in the spring, according to their forecasts. Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that the May Consumer Price Index, released earlier Wednesday, was \u201ccertainly a better inflation report than almost anybody expected.\u201d But he said officials still want to see inflation slow further before lowering borrowing costs. The\u00a0Fed\u00a0has kept interest\u00a0rates\u00a0at a 23-year high for nearly a year, after kicking off an aggressive rate-hiking campaign in March 2022. Central bankers are waiting for more evidence that\u00a0inflation\u00a0is headed toward 2%\u00a0\u2014 and the\u00a0economy\u2019s resilience is allowing them to be comfortably on hold. The\u00a0Fed\u00a0will begin cutting interest\u00a0rates\u00a0once it\u2019s clear that\u00a0inflation\u00a0has cooled enough and won\u2019t heat back up \u2014 or if the job market deteriorates much more than expected, but there are currently not many signs of that. The inflation situation is now better than it was in the first quarter: Consumer prices eased in May, the Labor Department reported Wednesday morning. From a year earlier, inflation rose 3.3% in May, down from April\u2019s 3.4% rise and also below economists\u2019 expectations. Fed\u00a0officials\u2019 latest policy statement noted that\u00a0inflation\u00a0has seen some \u201cmodest further progress\u201d toward their 2% target in recent months, versus the May statement that noted there had been a \u201clack\u201d of any improvements. Here are key takeaways from the Fed\u2019s latest decision on interest rates. Powell calls May inflation data \u2018encouraging\u2019 Not only was the Fed chief pleased with Wednesday\u2019s inflation report, saying it was a \u201cgood reading,\u201d but he maintained his view that interest rates are \u201crestrictive\u201d enough to rein in price hikes. Powell pointed to the substantial progress seen in the second half of last year as an example. Still, he said officials now think \u201cit\u2019s probably going to take longer to get the confidence needed to loosen policy,\u201d compared to what they thought in March. That\u2019s precisely what officials\u2019 forecasts showed. When asked what will help tug inflation closer to the Fed\u2019s 2% target, Powell said slower inflation will come \u201cfrom where it\u2019s been coming from,\u201d pointing to the \u201cthe unwinding of the pandemic-related distortions to both supply and demand.\u201d \u201cAnd that is complemented by, amplified by, supported by restrictive monetary policy, so those two things are working together,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve made pretty good progress on inflation with our current [policy] stance.\u201d Economists have said that it\u2019s only a matter of time until declining rents show up in official inflation gauges. Still-high housing costs are still looming large in the CPI: Shelter inflation more than offset the decline in gasoline seen last month, rising 0.4% for the fourth month in a row, the May CPI showed. No concerns about the job market Powell has frequently said the job market likely needs to come back \u201cinto better balance\u201d to ensure that inflation is on track to 2%. That\u2019s because a labor market that\u2019s running too hot could put some upward pressure on prices, making the Fed\u2019s job of fully defeating inflation more difficult. The Fed chief says so far so good. \u201cOverall, a broad set of indicators suggest that conditions in the labor market have returned to about where they stood on the eve of the pandemic, relatively tight but not overheated,\u201d Powell said in his post-meeting press conference on Wednesday afternoon. He pointed to data proving just that: Job gains averaging\u00a0218,000 a month in April and May; unemployment still at low levels, job creation driven by more prime-aged workers and immigrants trickling into the workforce; slower wage growth; and a narrower jobs-to-workers ratio. The Fed focuses on the job market not just because of its implications on inflation, but also because the central bank is explicitly tasked by Congress to strive toward maximum employment. If the labor market unexpectedly weakens, then that could force the Fed to consider cutting rates, but Powell didn\u2019t sound concerned at all. \u201cWe see gradual cooling, gradual moving toward a better balance,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re monitoring it carefully for signs of something more than that, but we really don\u2019t see that.\u201d First rate cut in September? Wall Street\u2019s best bet for the first rate cut is currently September, according to futures, and those odds improved markedly after the release of the May CPI. For that to happen, however,\u00a0inflation\u00a0will have to continue to drift lower in the coming months. Officials frequently emphasize that they are \u201cdata dependent\u201d and make conclusions about the\u00a0economy\u00a0after data stretching over several months reveal a trend. It\u2019s unclear if the factors that resulted in hotter-than-expected\u00a0inflation\u00a0readings earlier this year are still lurking in the background, but the May CPI provided some relief. \u201cThe belief that components boosting\u00a0inflation\u00a0in the first quarter were not indicative of current cost pressures needed to be validated. May\u2019s report provides strong evidence on that front,\u201d Matt Colyar, an economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, said in a note Wednesday. \u201cThe\u00a0Fed\u00a0is banking it can wait a few more months until\u00a0inflation\u00a0falls further.\u201d The US\u00a0economy\u00a0remains on strong footing for now, including the job market as employers continue to hire at a brisk pace. But it\u2019s unmistakable that some US consumers are under pressure. Still-high\u00a0inflation\u00a0is continuing to eat into some budgets, pandemic savings are drying up, borrowers continue to pile on more debt and the highest interest\u00a0rates\u00a0in nearly a quarter century are squeezing Americans.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/economy/june-fed-decision/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_17_business_china-property-price-record-slump-intl-hnk", "text": "Prices of new homes in China suffered their biggest fall in nearly a decade last month, in a sign that Beijing\u2019s \u201chistoric\u201d real estate rescue has not yet revived demand. Prices in 70 major cities were down 0.7% in May from April, National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) figures showed on Monday. That\u2019s the steepest month-on-month drop since October 2014, according to Reuters calculation. According to separate calculations by the Macquarie Group, prices of existing homes in those cities fell by 7.5% year-on-year last month, marking the biggest decline on record. A month ago, Beijing unveiled wide-ranging measures to rescue the crisis-hit property market, including asking local governments across the country to buy unsold homes from beleaguered developers and easing rules on purchases. \u201cTo be fair, one month is too short for the housing rescue package to take effect,\u201d said analysts from Societe Generale on Monday. Measures, including efforts to provide cheap loans to state-owned enterprises for buying unsold homes from distressed developers, will \u201ctake time\u201d to have an impact on the property market, the analysts said. Still, other numbers on the real estate sector remain bleak. Property investment for the first five months of the year dropped 10.1% from a year ago, according the NBS on Monday. New property sales fell 28% during the same period. A mixed bag Some parts of the Chinese economy reported a more optimistic picture, according to a separate set of top indicators released by the NBS on Monday. Retail sales increased 3.7% in May, accelerating from a 2.3% rise in April and beating market forecasts. Much of that boost came from a massive government trade-in programs for used cars and old home appliances, aimed at bolstering domestic consumption. The Labor Day \u201cGolden Week\u201d holiday, which ran from May 1 to May 5, also helped reignite some consumer spending. Industrial output lost some momentum, growing 5.6% in May from a year ago, compared to April\u2019s 6.7% increase. Fixed asset investment also missed expectations. But China\u2019s exports jumped 7.6% in May, marking the fastest pace since April 2023, according to customs data released earlier this month. Imports, however, fell short of estimates. \u201cThe growth is highly uneven,\u201d with exports as the driver and the property sector acting as a drag, said Macquarie analysts. The threat of deflation continues to haunt the world\u2019s second largest economy as domestic demand remains weak. The consumer price index inched up just 0.3% in May, unchanged from April, according to the NBS last week.\u00a0That was slightly below expectations. Producer prices dropped 1.4%, down for a 20th consecutive month. \u201cWhile China\u2019s growth remains uneven, we think more policy support is likely to come through to help keep growth on track for this year\u2019s GDP growth target [of around 5%],\u201d said analysts from HSBC on Monday. \u201cMore attention will turn towards next month\u2019s Third Plenum (of the Communist Party) which will highlight economic reforms for the coming years,\u201d they said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/business/china-property-price-record-slump-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_17_business_ham-bacon-prices", "text": "Shoppers in the meat aisle may have noticed something weird last month: Bacon prices are sizzling, but ham\u2019s not so hot. Bacon is more expensive than it was a year ago, with prices up 6.9% from May 2023 to May of this year, according to inflation data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Pork chops were up too, by 4.6%. But ham prices were lower, falling 5.4% overall and dropping 6.3% when you exclude canned varieties. What gives? Econ buffs may remember that prices are set according to supply and demand. You\u2019d expect any supply issues \u2014\u00a0like too many hogs, or too few \u2014\u00a0to cause prices of each of the items to move up or down, all in the same direction. The discrepancy, then, must be caused by differences on the demand side. And it is: Demand for domestic pork has grown in recent years outside of the US. But rising demand, plus the same or reduced supply, should push prices up, not down. So again, what gives? To understand you have to zoom out, looking at long-term retail pricing strategy and food price trends. It\u2019s all relative Glynn Tonsor, a professor in the department of agriculture economics at Kansas State University suggests that if you zoom out, pork prices are indeed going up across the board. From May 2019 to May 2024, according to government data shared by the Federal Reserve of St. Louis, prices of ham, pork chops and bacon all went up. But prices for ham actually went up\u00a0higher\u00a0than the prices of bacon and pork chops. That\u2019s because US ham exports have been booming, particularly to Mexico. \u201cIn the middle of that five-year period, we had that Mexican demand boost,\u201d Tonsor said. \u201cThe US market\u2019s competing with Mexico for the same ham,\u201d he added. \u201cSo the prices are going to be higher domestically.\u201d So that year-over-year decrease you see in the grocery store is really just a drop from those heights. People love bacon Another reason for high bacon prices: Strong demand, even when it\u2019s expensive. \u201cPeople are more willing to pay for bacon than they are maybe some other pork products,\u201d said Christine McCracken, senior animal protein analyst at RaboBank. Retailers set prices strategically. So if they know that customers are more willing to spend more on bacon, they might keep those prices high or raise them to make up for decreases in other areas, where customers might spend less. Prices in the supermarket aren\u2019t just tied to cost. They\u2019re also determined according to the psychology of how people shop. For example: If you see a deal for eggs or pancake mix, you might go into the store for those items. Once inside, you may very well pick up a package of bacon as a treat \u2014 because you\u2019ll be making breakfast at home, anyway, and you got a good price for most of the meal. It\u2019s also possible that bacon prices are not quite as high as they seem because of discounts. \u201cWhat you see more in bacon is kind of a high-low strategy,\u201d said McCracken. \u201cYou\u2019ll keep the price high on a normal day and then put it on super sale.\u201d And even if bacon, pork chops and (taking the long view) ham are getting more expensive, they might still be a cheaper protein option than beef \u2014 not to mention restaurant meals. Cheaper than fast food While grocery prices are flattening, menu prices continue to increase \u2014\u00a0frustrating customers and prompting some to dine out less often and spend less when they do. Grocery prices rose 1% in the 12 months through May, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In that period, menu prices at full-service, or sit-down, restaurants rose 3.5%. They jumped 4.5% at limited-service restaurants, which include fast food and fast casual joints. Chains from Burger King to KFC to Starbucks have started offering menu deals in an effort both to bring people back and restore their reputations as affordable food options. Still, buying bacon from the supermarket and making a sandwich at home is cheaper than buying a BLT or a bacon cheeseburger from a restaurant. Even if grocery-store bacon is pricier than it was this time last year.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/business/ham-bacon-prices/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_01_tech_aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl", "text": "A London-based technology company is looking to \u201cdemocratize\u201d talent-identification and scouting in soccer using a mobile app. Free to download and available globally, the aiScout app allows aspiring soccer stars to enter virtual trials for professional clubs by uploading self-recorded footage of themselves completing a series of drills. It offers 75 exercises, designed to test a range of skills, with videos showing users how to complete them. Performances are automatically scored by artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The data can then be accessed by clubs, allowing their scouts to peruse scores for viable talent, honing their search with a variety of filters; from age and gender to position on the pitch. The app currently has two English Premier League (EPL) partners, Chelsea and Burnley, and clubs can tailor their in-app trials to meet specific needs and set their own benchmarks by having their academy players complete the same drills. \u201cWe\u2019re putting that data up front to make better use of [the scouts\u2019] time,\u201d said Richard Felton-Thomas, chief operating officer of ai.io, the company behind the app. \u201cTo say [to scouts], \u2018Go over to this place today because there\u2019s three players in that game that are all actually beating your Chelsea standard\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s going to be the best use of your time.\u2019\u201d It already appears to be working for some. Ben Greenwood had never had a trial with a professional club until he downloaded the app in 2019. After uploading footage of himself, the 17-year-old landed a trial with Chelsea, becoming the first user of the app to get a trial with a pro club. He signed a contract\u00a0with EPL team Bournemouth\u00a0in 2021. \u2018It\u2019s more about evolution\u2019 Having beta-tested in with players spanning 125 countries, Greenwood among them, 135 players have been trialed or signed by pro clubs or national teams through the app \u2014 which fully launched in September 2023 \u2014 according to Felton-Thomas. Just over 100,000 players make up the current database, but with over 100 clubs lined up to join Chelsea and Burnley, as well as a multi-year partnership with Major League Soccer in the US announced last May, Felton-Thomas projects user numbers to surge into the millions as the operation ramps up this year. Felton-Thomas said the \u201clion\u2019s share\u201d of its income comes from charging clubs a license fee to run the platform. Annual fees vary depending on the size of the club and the tools they require, ranging from six figures for \u201ctier one\u201d sides like Chelsea, to thousands of pounds for clubs lower down the footballing pyramid. The use of smart technology in sport continues to expand, including\u00a0AI commentary tools and wearable tech for elite athletes. The global market for sports analytics, valued at\u00a0$2.7 billion\u00a0in 2023, is projected to grow 22% by the end of the decade, according to market research firm Grand View Research. Should soccer talent scouts be concerned about being edged out by the arrival of AI in their industry? For Felton-Thomas, new technologies can co-exist with traditional methods. \u201cIt\u2019s more about evolution than revolution,\u201d Felton-Thomas explained. \u201cWe can\u2019t tell you when that player\u2019s actually in that match, how does he deal with adversity? What happens when he\u2019s 2-0 down? What happens when someone\u2019s shouting at him? What happens when he\u2019s just made a massive mistake?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got the ability to just augment real people to do their jobs better and faster, which then gives an opportunity to the player through the AI, but you\u2019re still actually just connecting them to the human on the other side, which is the club and the scout.\u201d While football remains ai.io\u2019s primary focus, the company is looking into opportunities in other sports to launch in the coming years. Further ahead, it may branch out beyond sports. \u201cYou think about the notion that you can be at home and analyze your movements, and how this could spin into health care, physical assessments for military disciplines and emergency services,\u201d Felton-Thomas told CNN.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/01/tech/aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_20_investing_microsoft-stock-record-high-altman-openai", "text": "Microsoft stock reached a record high on Monday after the company said that Sam Altman, former chief executive of OpenAI, will join the company to head its artificial intelligence innovation leg. Shares of the tech behemoth rose 2.1% to an all-time high close of $377.44 on Monday, beating the previous record of $376.17. That comes after shares of Microsoft fell 1.7% on Friday, when Sam Altman was ousted from his position at OpenAI in a boardroom coup. Microsoft is the artificial intelligence firm\u2019s biggest stakeholder, with a $13 billion investment in the company. Greg Brockman, who co-founded OpenAI and quit after Altman\u2019s firing, is also joining Microsoft. Altman\u2019s hiring ended days of speculation that the former chief executive could return to the firm after his dramatic firing. Emmett Shear, former CEO of Amazon-owned streaming service Twitch, will replace OpenAI chief technology officer Mira Murati as interim chief executive. Microsoft shares are up about 56% for the year. The stock is one of the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d that have powered the lion\u2019s share of the market\u2019s returns this year, boosted by Wall Street\u2019s bet that artificial intelligence is the next big thing in tech.

{"id": "2024_06_12_economy_inflation-real-time-data", "text": "If you want to know how much a publicly traded company is worth at any given time, all you have to do is look up its market cap, which updates in real time during trading hours. But if you want to know how fast prices are rising in the US, you get two official updates a month \u2014 the Consumer Price Index and the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index. Both come with a lag, can be revised several months later and can even be indefinitely delayed in the event of a government shutdown, as was almost the case with September\u2019s inflation data. Despite these shortcomings, officials at the Federal Reserve rely on these government reports to help make crucial monetary policy decisions that directly influence the interest rates you pay on your mortgage and other kinds of debt. The inflation rate the government arrives at also impacts how much you receive in Social Security benefits and likely is a factor in determining your pay. But a novel real-time inflation gauge called Truflation is trying to fix some of the issues with government inflation data that has long been considered the gold standard. While it\u2019s valuable to have regularly updated inflation data, Truflation doesn\u2019t have as much access to certain categories the government data tracks, namely education and health care prices, two big expenses for many Americans. The government also has a much longer history of producing inflation reports with extremely thorough standards. How it works Unlike PCE and CPI, Truflation arrives at a new inflation rate on a near-daily basis, drawing from over 60 different data sources that provide three unique prices across more than 18 million goods and services. Some of the data providers include Amazon, Walmart, Nielsen, Hilton and Zillow. While the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the division of the Labor Department that produces monthly CPI reports, enlists a team of people to either physically go to businesses, call them up or scan websites to collect pricing data for 80,000 goods and services across the country, Truflation pays for some of the data. Over time, more providers have been sharing data for free because they recognize that having it incorporated into the model will give them more updated and accurate information on how competitive their pricing is, Stefan Rust, CEO and founder of Truflation, told CNN. That data goes through a rigorous process incorporating blockchain technology to verify its authenticity, which Truflation outlines in its public 20-page methodology. Like PCE and CPI, Truflation assigns relative importance values to categories to mirror how an average consumer\u2019s income is allocated. For most consumers, housing accounts for the majority of their spending, and is therefore assigned a greater weight than, for instance, clothing. That\u2019s why small increases in the cost of housing can end up having big impacts on the overall inflation rate. Truflation uses the same process the government does to calculate relative importance, but it uses some different data to determine how consumers allocate their income. That accounts for some of the variation between the government\u2019s inflation data and Truflation\u2019s. Another discrepancy is that Truflation\u2019s data is not seasonally adjusted, whereas the government\u2019s monthly data is. That means that an increase in utility prices during the summer when it\u2019s typically more expensive to cool your home would show up more in Truflation\u2019s data than the government\u2019s. As of Wednesday, Truflation put the nation\u2019s annual inflation rate at 2.23%, just inches away from the Fed\u2019s 2% target. In contrast, May\u2019s CPI report released Wednesday morning arrived at a 3.3% inflation rate, matching precisely what Truflation predicted the gauge would come in at based on its data. Truflation is able to predict what government inflation reports will show by adjusting their data to when the government goes out and collects its own pricing data to form its monthly reports. How Truflation data is being used Wall Street traders were the first group drawn to Truflation, Rust said. \u201cThey wanted the data to help them calculate where they felt, based on our data, the government BLS numbers would come out on.\u201d Danielle DiMartino Booth, who advised\u00a0Richard Fisher\u00a0when he was the president of the Dallas Fed and who is now CEO and chief strategist at QI Research, said she uses Truflation \u201cto identify where price pressures are cropping up\u201d on a daily basis. That gives her a \u201cbetter feel\u201d of what\u2019s happening on the ground versus the government\u2019s data, Booth told CNN. While Fed officials have taken a greater interest in analyzing economic data from non-government sources to help shape their views on the economy, it remains to be seen if and how they\u2019re using Truflation data. But it\u2019s on their radar, said Rust, who says he has met with researchers from the New York and Dallas Fed.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/economy/inflation-real-time-data/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl", "text": "Sam Altman has agreed to return to lead OpenAI, the company said in a Tuesday post on X, just days after his surprise ouster as chief executive sparked an employee revolt that threatened to undermine what has been the leading company in the fledgling artificial intelligence industry. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman wrote that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft, which is the ChatGPT maker\u2019s biggest financial backer. The announcement appears to bring to an end days of chaos for the AI industry that included negotiations over who should lead OpenAI and how the firm should be run, as well as broader discussions about just how fast the arms race to develop AI technology should be moving. The details of Altman\u2019s firing and re-hiring remain murky. In its announcement Friday, OpenAI claimed that Altman had been insufficiently \u201ccandid\u201d with the board. That ambiguous language sent the rumor mill flying. But a key factor in Altman\u2019s ouster was the presence of\u00a0tensions between Altman, who favored pushing AI development more aggressively, and members of the original OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the crisis. As of Monday morning, Nadella had announced that Altman, along with fellow OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, would be joining Microsoft to lead a new AI research division. OpenAI said it had hired former Twitch chief Emmett Shear as interim CEO. But then hundreds of OpenAI employees, nearly the company\u2019s entire staff, threatened to leave, potentially for Microsoft, if the company\u2019s board didn\u2019t resign and reinstate Altman as CEO. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it invested billions in to help bolster its ambitions in developing AI, which many in Silicon Valley think will be the most important wave of technological advancement in the coming decades. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Microsoft CEO\u00a0Satya Nadella said on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d Altman\u2019s vision to quickly roll out and commercialize AI tools also appears to have won out. Publicly, Altman has long cautioned about risks posed by AI, and he\u202fhas pledged to lawmakers and customers that he would move OpenAI forward responsibly. \u201cIs [AI] gonna be like the printing press that diffused knowledge, power and learning widely across the landscape that empowered ordinary, everyday individuals that led to greater flourishing, that led above all to greater liberty?\u201d he said in a May Senate subcommittee hearing pressing for regulation. \u201cOr is it gonna be more like the atom bomb \u2014 huge technological breakthrough, but the consequences (severe, terrible) continue to haunt us to this day?\u201d But inside the company, Altman had been pushing to bring products to market more quickly and to sell them for a profit. Altman announced a few weeks ago at OpenAI\u2019s first-ever developer day that the company would make tools available so anyone could create their own version of ChatGPT. OpenAI has also worked with Microsoft to roll out ChatGPT-like technology across Microsoft\u2019s products. OpenAI and iPhone designer Jony Ive had also reportedly\u202fbeen in talks to raise $1 billion from Japanese conglomerate SoftBank for an AI device to replace the smartphone. \u2014 CNN\u2019s Juliana Liu and Diksha Madhok contributed reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_16_media_washington-post-will-lewis-phone-hacking", "text": "A report from the New York Times on Saturday alleges\u00a0Will Lewis, the Washington Post\u2019s embattled new publisher and chief executive,\u00a0used fraudulent and unethical methods\u00a0to obtain information for articles while working at the London-based Sunday Times\u00a0in the early 2000s. Citing a former co-worker of Lewis\u2019, a private investigator and its own investigation of newspaper archives, the New York Times said Lewis used phone and company records that were\u00a0\u201cfraudulently obtained\u201d\u00a0through hacking and paying sources for information. Through the haze of accusations, it remains unclear whether these claims will prompt Lewis to step down from the helm of one of the most distinguished outlets in the country. Even so, experts see Lewis\u2019 grasp on the newsroom as one that is increasingly weakening. Margaret Sullivan, executive director of the Craig\u00a0Newmark Center for Journalism Ethics and Security at Columbia University\u2019s School of Journalism, told CNN on Sunday that Lewis\u2019 position is \u201cincreasingly untenable.\u201d These latest allegations of\u00a0questionable\u00a0journalistic ethics could also leave an enduring impression on a newsroom already reeling from the blindsiding ouster of its executive editor,\u00a0Sally Buzbee. The allegations may also end up reflecting on the paper\u2019s own reputation as a standard-bearer for American journalism. Late on Sunday, the Washington Post itself published a story about Robert Winnett, whom Lewis appointed to take the top job at the Post\u2019s core newsroom after the US presidential election in November. The Post article alleged that Winnett, a Lewis protege, was linked to a man who used dishonest means to obtain information that Winnett\u00a0then used in his journalism. In a statement, the Washington Post said: \u201cWe cover The Washington Post independently, rigorously and fairly. Given perceived and potential conflicts, we have asked former senior managing editor Cameron Barr, who stepped down from that position in 2023 and now has a contractual relationship as a senior associate editor, to oversee this coverage. The publisher has no involvement in or influence on our reporting.\u201d In a follow-up on Monday, the Post added that \u201cThe executive editor and relevant masthead editors review and provide input, with Cameron\u2019s concurrence, to ensure that our work meets our highest standards.\u201d Winnett did not immediately respond to a CNN query via LinkedIn. The Society of Professional Journalists, which represents about 7,000 members across the country and whose journalism standards\u00a0are recognized in\u00a0many newsrooms, warns journalists in its\u00a0Code of Ethics: \u201cDo not pay for access to news.\u201d While SPJ does not explicitly address hacking as a means of newsgathering, it does tell journalists to \u201cavoid undercover or other surreptitious methods of gathering information unless traditional, open methods will not yield information vital to the public\u201d but cautions that \u201cpursuit of the news is not a license for arrogance of\u00a0undue intrusiveness.\u201d The new accusations come as Lewis tries to fend off resurfacing allegations of his involvement in a UK phone hacking scandal coverup, in which he has repeatedly denied wrongdoing.\u00a0Lewis has\u00a0previously said\u00a0his role in the scandal consisted of rooting out problematic behavior. A spokesperson for the Washington Post told CNN Lewis declined to comment. A Washington Post source with knowledge of internal meetings at the paper last week told CNN that Lewis has told employees \u201chis role as publisher is to create the environment for great journalism and to encourage and support it, that he will never interfere in the journalism and that he is very clear about the lines that should not be crossed.\u201d The\u00a0decade-old scandal\u00a0engulfed right-wing media mogul Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News of the World tabloid and was revived in recent years in a\u00a0new lawsuit filed\u00a0by Prince Harry and Hollywood figures including Guy Ritchie and Hugh Grant. At the time of the News of the World controversy, Lewis was a senior executive at Murdoch\u2019s News Corporation. But a cascade of claims has followed Lewis in recent weeks, mostly involving\u00a0alleged attempts to suppress stories about his connection with the coverup. Earlier this month, the New York Times first reported that Lewis, who took the reins at the Washington Post on January 2, clashed with\u00a0Buzbee\u00a0over publishing an article in May that named him in connection to the scandal,\u00a0although a\u00a0spokesperson for Lewis has denied he pressured Buzbee\u00a0to quash the article, according to NPR.  Buzbee abruptly left the company earlier this month. Days later, an NPR reporter said Lewis offered him an interview in exchange for quashing a forthcoming article about the scandal. The Washington Post did not respond to CNN with regard to these allegations. A spokesperson for Lewis\u00a0told the New York Times earlier this month\u00a0when the story broke that \u201cwhen he was a private citizen ahead of joining The Washington Post, he had off the record conversations with an employee of NPR about a story the employee then published.\u201d The spokesperson added that any request for an interview after he joined the Washington Post was \u201cprocessed through the normal corporate communication channels.\u201d Buzbee\u2019s departure has seemingly frayed Lewis\u2019 command of his newsroom even further. A number of Post staffers who spoke to CNN have described plummeting morale. \u201cIt\u2019s as bad as I\u2019ve ever seen it, truly,\u201d one staffer said earlier this month, noting that the Washington Post has hit \u201crough patches\u201d before but that the stormy atmosphere hanging over the outlet is unprecedented. In an opinion piece for the Guardian on Wednesday, Sullivan wrote that firing Lewis and finding a new CEO is \u201cthe cleanest, best move\u201d Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos could make. Lewis\u2019 insistence on tamping down reporting about him \u201chas motivated several news organizations to look more deeply into his past; it\u2019s possible that some new revelation will make his Post leadership position even more untenable and will force Bezos\u2019 hand,\u201d she added. Sullivan also wrote in her op-ed that Lewis could try to repair the trust both within and outside the newsroom by acknowledging that he will not cross any ethical lines and reiterating his commitment to giving staffers \u201ctrue editorial independence.\u201d He could also work toward reinstating an independent public editor or ombudsman \u2014 a position the Washington Post nixed more than a decade ago \u2014 who would oversee the paper\u2019s implementation of journalistic ethics.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/16/media/washington-post-will-lewis-phone-hacking/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2022_04_25_business_electric-hybrid-corvette", "text": "General Motors will produce a fully electric Chevrolet Corvette, GM President Mark Reuss announced in a LinkedIn post Monday morning.  Reuss didn\u2019t say when the electric Corvette would come, but he hinted that a hybrid model could come relatively soon. \u201cWe will offer an electrified Corvette as early as next year,\u201d he wrote. An accompanying video the company posted to Twitter showed what appeared to be a hybrid Corvette, and in another first, showed the front wheels spinning and throwing snow as if being powered. All Corvettes produced by the company previously have been rear-wheel-drive only. While Reuss\u2019s post implies a hybrid Corvette will be based on the current generation of the car, it\u2019s not clear if the all-electric version will be a variation of this car or a completely different future model. \u201cElectrified\u201d is an auto industry term encompassing everything from hybrid to fully electric vehicles, and anything with an electric motor can count as \u201celectrified.\u201d It has long been rumored that the current generation of the Corvette, the first with its gasoline engine mounted behind the seats instead of in the front, could be built with a hybrid system. Reuss has also previously hinted there would be electrified variants of the car. Various companies are working on electric sports cars. Most all-electric vehicles in production so far have been four-door sedans and SUVs, as the need for batteries lends itself to larger and heavier vehicles. Tesla\u2019s first car, the Lotus Elise-based Tesla Roadster, was an electric sports car, but the second-generation of Tesla Roadster, originally unveiled as a prototype in 2017, has yet to go into production. Some manufacturers, such as Lamborghini, have said that current battery technology doesn\u2019t allow for a optimum sports car performance from a purely electric vehicle. Lamborghini has been working on plug-in hybrid sports cars, though. To date, the Corvette is only available in the base Stingray version with 6.2-liter V8 engine producing up to 495 horsepower. A 670 horsepower Corvette Z06 with a 5.5-liter V8 was unveiled last fall. The previous generation of the Corvette included included a 755-horsepower ZR1 version. Nothing like that has yet been announced for the current model but GM engineers have said a major reason for putting the engine in the back was to allow for better performance at extremely high horsepower levels. Besides saving gas, hybrid systems can also be used in high-performance cars to add additional power and to provide for quicker acceleration since electric motors can provide power to the wheels more quickly than gas engines. Ferrari\u2019s most powerful sports cars are hybrids, for instance.   GM has said it plans to produce only zero-emission vehicles, meaning fully electric or powered by hydrogen fuel cells, by 2035.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/25/business/electric-hybrid-corvette/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "business"}}

The initial public offering (IPO) will make it the country\u2019s first car maker to go public in two decades since Maruti Suzuki in 2003, and would come just as Indian stock markets are trading near record highs. Hyundai counts India as a crucial growth market where it has two manufacturing units and has invested $5 billion, with commitments to pump in another $4 billion over the next decade. The world\u2019s biggest car market after China and the United States is the company\u2019s third-biggest revenue generator globally. The Hyundai draft prospectus filed gave no details of the pricing of the IPO or the company\u2019s valuation, but sources have said Hyundai aims to raise around $2.5 to $3 billion at a valuation of up to $30 billion. Hyundai, India\u2019s second-biggest car maker behind Maruti Suzuki, will not issue new shares in the IPO, which will involve its South Korean parent selling part of its stake in the wholly owned unit to retail and other investors via a so-called \u201coffer for sale\u201d route. The listing is seen putting Hyundai Motor India on a stronger footing versus Maruti Suzuki, Tata Motors and\u00a0other rivals\u00a0as it could make future fundraising easier, without the need to depend on its Korean parent. Hyundai expects the listing of the equity shares in India \u201cwill enhance our visibility and brand image,\u201d and \u201cprovide liquidity and a public market\u201d for the shares, the company said in the draft prospectus filed on Saturday. It did not provide a timeline for the listing, but typically India\u2019s markets regulator, the Securities and Exchange Board of India, takes three to six months to approve, reject or seek more information on IPOs. The company said it plans to focus on \u201cpremiumisation\u201d \u2014 selling more expensive cars, as well as increasing its EV market share and adding charging stations, where it lags behind Tata Motors. Hyundai India also said it wants to ship more cars, \u201cstrengthening\u201d its position as an export hub. Affordable cars Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi sees the automotive industry as a cornerstone to boosting growth in the world\u2019s fifth-largest economy. His government has built hundreds of kilometers of new roads and is incentivising car makers to increase local manufacturing, especially of electric vehicles. Hyundai entered India 28 years ago and has won over buyers with its affordable cars such as Santro and sports-utility vehicle Creta. The company has plans to launch new electric vehicles, establish charging stations and a battery pack assembly unit. The South Korean parent will sell up to 142 million of the total 812 million shares, or 17.5%, in the IPO. The sources have said the final percentage could be lower. With the IPO, Hyundai aims to unlock value for the Indian business and also help the Korean automaker shed its valuation discount compared to global and Asian peers. Benchmark Indian stock indices have doubled between 2019 and 2023, while Seoul\u2019s KOSPI index has risen just 30% over the same period.

{"id": "2024_06_16_economy_rv-sales-economy", "text": "At this time of year, a reservation with Chill RV Rentals isn\u2019t usually the easiest to come by. The Los Angeles-based company\u2019s 16-camper fleet is typically booked solid, with the RVs oftentimes reserved weeks in advance. That\u2019s just not the case this year, said Nika Shneyder, who started the recreational vehicle rental business with her father in 2016. Bookings are light; plus, the people who are traveling are taking shorter trips, she said. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely seeing demand for RV travel slowed down compared to previous years, and I don\u2019t think it has to do with people coming out [the pandemic] and going on different kinds of trips,\u201d Shneyder said. \u201cI actually think it has a lot to do with people having less discretionary spending available.\u201d She added: \u201cI think we\u2019re going to pick up this summer, in July and August for sure; but historically speaking, we would have been busier by now.\u201d On the retail sales side, there are similar stories at play: Businesses are seeing softer, but improving, demand; consumers are showing some hesitancy but still are spending some; and industry members are exhibiting cautious, but growing, optimism. The industry appears to be not only getting back into gear but also settling into a familiar groove: its role as an economic bellwether. When consumer sentiment falters or the economy starts to teeter, RV sales follow suit, said Michael Hicks, an economics professor at Ball State University and director of Indiana University\u2019s Center for Business and Economic Research. RVs are typically large-dollar items for individuals and families, costing about $12,000 to $15,000 for a small, pop-up, tow-behind trailer, to some that run well north of $250,000 or more for a motorhome or luxury offering. \u201cPeople don\u2019t make these large, luxury purchases unless they\u2019re actually feeling better about the economy,\u201d said Hicks, who follows the RV industry closely. \u201cIt\u2019s so sensitive to interest rate changes, which often precede a downturn.\u201d RV shipments, a proxy for sales, are starting to pick back up after having bottomed out last year \u2014 an aftershock of a wild, pandemic-era upheaval. So, if business is on the upswing \u2014 especially at a time when the dual forces of elevated inflation and high interest rates are serving as headwinds \u2014 that could bode well for the economy as a whole, he said. Still, while that economic indicator doesn\u2019t appear to be flashing red right now, it likely will take interest rates falling from their current 23-year highs before it turns a solid green. \u201cWe think [interest rate cuts] will offer a little bit of a trigger to consumers becoming more active again,\u201d Michael J. Happe, president and chief executive officer of Winnebago Industries, said during the company\u2019s March earnings call. #Vanlife fallout-turned-opportunity The cost of borrowing is so high right now that Chill RV hasn\u2019t been able to add new vehicles to its fleet. \u201cWe\u2019ve been able to get a little creative with it,\u201d Shneyder said. \u201cInstead of purchasing our own inventory, because the rates are so high, we\u2019ve opened up a consignment program where we rent out privately owned RVs and do a profit-share.\u201d And that consignment well is pretty deep right now, a reflection of the pandemic-era #YOLO, #vanlife purchases that just didn\u2019t pan out for some. \u201cWe find people who during Covid went out and bought an RV for themselves, and they\u2019re just sort of done with it, they no longer use it,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so now we\u2019ve rented it out for them.\u201d Five of the 16 vehicles in Chill RV\u2019s fleet are on consignment, she said. The big spike in sales seen during the pandemic turned the entire industry on its head and knocked its economic barometer out of whack, Hicks said. \u201cPotential buyers moved to purchase RVs earlier than they\u2019d originally planned,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cSo, some folks who were planning on buying one later jumped at the chance to hit low borrowing rates in the wake of the pandemic. This ate into 2022 and 2023 sales.\u201d Roller-coaster sales RV shipments rocketed north of 600,000 in 2021, a nearly 40% jump from the year before. They moved down to a historically strong, but noticeably smaller, 493,000 the next year, according to data from the RV Industry Association. By 2023, orders fell back to Earth \u2014 hard \u2014 clocking in at a mere 313,000. Dealers had to work through inventory while also navigating a steep drop-off in demand, said Monika Geraci, spokesperson for the RVIA. In addition to sales being pulled forward during the pandemic, other purchases were put on the blocks because of inflation and high interest rates, she said. Consumer spending on RVs did fall off last year, as compared to 2021 and 2022, inflation-adjusted Commerce Department data shows. Consumers spent nearly $38 billion in the category of \u201cother recreational vehicles,\u201d which excludes pleasure boats and aircraft, according to Personal Consumption Expenditures data. That\u2019s down from $42.9 billion and $44.1 billion in 2021 and 2022, respectively, but above 2019 spending of $31 billion. Now, the industry appears to be back at a point of equilibrium, where shipments, production and sales at the retail level are more closely aligned, she added. The latest forecast from RVIA, released earlier this month, projects shipments to land in the range of 329,900 to 359,100 for 2024, with a median of 344,000 units. That\u2019s expected to grow next year to between 374,200 to 408,600. The moderate increase is based on the expectation that interest rates are going to start coming down and inflation will cool further to the point people have the financial wherewithal to make the purchase, she said. \u201cWe do know from our surveys that the desire to own an RV and purchase an RV is still there and still is high,\u201d she said. \u201cInflation, interest rates do just hit people\u2019s pocketbooks and make it a little bit harder to follow through on those desires.\u201d RV capital of the world To fully get a sense of how the RV industry (and, in turn, the broader economy, is faring), one need not look further than Elkhart, Indiana. The Northern Indiana city that sits 15 miles east of South Bend is known as the \u201cRV Capital of the World.\u201d Many of the leading manufacturers and suppliers have facilities there, resulting in the vast majority of the RVs on US roads being made in Elkhart. \u201cAnd even the ones that are not made here are still made here, because all their parts are made here,\u201d said David Titus, co-owner of International RV Wholesalers in Elkhart. Manufacturing and transportation account for more than 60% of all the jobs held in Elkhart, making the county one of the country\u2019s biggest production hubs, Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows. When there\u2019s been a downshift in the industry, Elkhart (and its unemployment rate) has reflected that pain. In March 2009, during the Great Recession, Elkhart County\u2019s jobless rate hit 20.6% and spiked to 30.6% in April 2020, the height of the pandemic lockdowns. Flash-forward to January 2023, when shipments had fallen off due to oversupply and a pullback in demand, and unemployment jumped to 5.6% from 3%. It\u2019s since moved back down and in April 2024 stood at 3.8%, a tick below the national rate of 3.9% at the time. \u201cEmployment in this sector is ebbing a bit, which is consistent with slower sales,\u201d said Ball State\u2019s Hicks. \u201cHowever, we haven\u2019t seen any of the large job cuts we did during the Great Recession. [The unemployment rate in Elkhart] suggests optimism by RV producers that the market will strengthen in the coming months.\u201d \u2018Bumper-to-bumper\u2019 optimism At the dealer level, there\u2019s optimism as well. Customers are still driving on the lot looking to buy an RV, International RV Wholesalers\u2019 Titus said, adding that banks are still happy to lend the money \u2014 albeit at more of a premium. Some customers are leaning toward something a little more modest because of interest rates, he said, adding that they\u2019re also planning shorter trips closer to home \u2014 versus the 3,000- or 4,000-mile cross-country haul \u2014 because of inflation and fuel costs. Complicating matters further is a cyclical factor: It\u2019s an election year, and like clockwork, some people appear to be holding off and waiting to see what happens, he said. \u201cElection years are always off, so we\u2019ll be happy when we get through November,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously, this is a little more of a contentious election than normal, putting it nicely, than what we\u2019ve seen in the past. It really doesn\u2019t matter who wins, just as long as it\u2019s done.\u201d Still, sales are softer than they were during the pandemic boom, but they\u2019re trending better than last year and above pre-pandemic times, Titus said. \u201cYou drive through town, everybody\u2019s busy; you can\u2019t go to a restaurant at 6 o\u2019clock and expect to get a table; you go to the store, and it\u2019s busy,\u201d Titus said. \u201cI\u2019m looking at a four-lane road in front of my place right now, and it\u2019s bumper-to-bumper traffic.\u201d He added: \u201cHere in Elkhart it does seem business as usual. Could business be better? Of course it could. But could it be worse? It sure could.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/16/economy/rv-sales-economy/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_17_success_how-to-find-good-affordable-colleges", "text": "Long before you take your high schooler on college campus tours, consider this: Shopping for college shouldn\u2019t be any different than shopping for a home.\u00a0When you want to buy a home, you come up with a range of how much you can afford and get pre-qualified for a mortgage. Then you look in neighborhoods that offer homes that meet your family\u2019s needs and fall within your price range. \u201cAdopt a mindset that we\u2019re buying college like we\u2019re buying a house,\u201d said Beth Walker, author of \u201cBuying College Better\u201d and \u201cNever Pay Retail for College.\u201d As a financial adviser and certified\u00a0college planning specialist, Walker tries to help families avoid a situation that many find themselves in at the 11th hour: Their child applies \u2014 and gets into \u2014 schools they cannot afford because the schools won\u2019t give them enough aid. And then they just \u2026 try to make it work, no matter how much debt is involved for the parents or the student. Instead, she advises families to start as early as 9th or 10th grade in figuring out what is affordable for them as a family \u2014 so parents don\u2019t sacrifice their own financial welfare and the future college student doesn\u2019t drown in debt upon graduation. And second, she recommends assessing how a child\u2019s talents and interests pare with majors and careers they might want to pursue. Doing both those things can help you target the right colleges to apply to. Mike McKinnon, executive director of the National Institute of Certified College Planners, defines the perfect college as one \u201cwhere a student can go be happy, safe and successful, graduate in four years or less with a marketable degree and little or no debt.\u201d In helping families align parents\u2019 affordability constraints with their student\u2019s academic and social needs, he cautions them not to automatically assume the Ivys or other high-prestige schools will be best simply because of their status. And he stresses what success in life looks like after college and notes that an Ivy League degree isn\u2019t the only path to achieving it, especially if your child won\u2019t get much aid to attend. In fact, said Todd Fothergill, founder and CEO of Strategies for College, a lot of brand-name schools don\u2019t even offer merit-based aid, only need-based. So if you\u2019re not rich, but you make too much to qualify for need-based aid, you could find yourself having to cover the entire cost of tuition, room and board every year, which is pushing $90,000 at some US colleges. Set up financial guardrails well before the college search Fothergill created a free calculator called CostHero that lets parents assess what financial resources they will have available to pay for a child\u2019s college education. It then provides a range of affordability: At the low end is the number representing what they can pay if they don\u2019t take on debt. And at the high end is the number they can pay if they also take out an unsubsidized federal Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students (PLUS). \u201cIf you\u2019re not in a position to write a check for $90,000 a year, put up guardrails for yourself so you don\u2019t blow up your retirement,\u201d he said. The calculator inputs let you set the amount of resources you\u2019re willing to use to pay for college from your income and savings, your child\u2019s earnings from summer jobs, any family gifts, and any federal Stafford loans your child may take. It also factors in if you qualify for the federal American Opportunity Tax Credit. That credit, for qualified educational expenses, will reduce your tax bill or increase any refund you have coming. The calculator also gives you a debt-to-income score like the kind a mortgage lender might use to assess whether you\u2019re a good credit risk. Ideally, he said, you don\u2019t want your housing costs to exceed 36% of your gross income and your total debt \u2014 including debt from housing, cars, credit cards and any parental education loans \u2014 to exceed 43%. If your DTI ratio is close to or higher than 43% that is a sign you could get yourself into trouble if you end up having any financial problems while your child is in college, Fothergill said. \u201cIf folks have a way to determine the range of affordability prior to the onset of the college search, the outcomes are a lot better.\u00a0 For example, if one knows that the range of affordability is between $30,000 [a year] with no parent debt and $50,000 with parent debt, then any college that comes in with a net cost in that range is, by definition, affordable,\u201d Fothergill said. Net cost refers to the true cost of attendance after figuring out how much aid your child may get (e.g., grants and scholarships). Figure out where your student may qualify for the most aid Generally speaking, the biggest tuition discounts go to the most academically accomplished students in an incoming class. \u201cThe student needs to be in the top 25% of those admitted,\u201d Walker said. Getting into that top 25% cohort is based on SAT or ACT scores, and having a high, unweighted GPA based on a rigorous high school curriculum. The curriculum\u2019s academic rigor can be further bolstered by taking AP courses. Since your child is more likely to make the top quartile at some schools than others, Fothergill and Walker both recommend your child focus on applying only to those schools in which they stand the best chances of being in that top group to maximize their chances for merit-based aid. Otherwise, you\u2018ll spend money to apply to guidance-counselor-recommended \u201csafety\u201d schools or \u201creach\u201d schools with no sense if those places are affordable to you should your child get in. Using reported data from admissions officers about their key criteria in admitting an incoming class and based on what more than 1,000 schools report about the qualifications they used to grant aid, Fothergill created another tool called ListHero. It gives students a score that helps gauge\u00a0how competitive their profile is\u00a0at a given school, relative to others admitted, and by extension their eligibility for tuition discounts. Right now the tool is only available to college planning professionals for a fee. But Fothergill plans to create a free mini-version for consumers to use. For parents doing their own research on test scores, GPA requirements, costs and aid, he recommends checking the Department of Education College Scorecard, the site CollegeData.com and the College Board. Other ways to reduce college costs before applying While your children are in high school they can take other steps to reduce the total cost of their education. One way is by doing well on the PSAT to qualify to compete for a National Merit Scholarship. Another is to take AP courses. If their high school doesn\u2019t offer them, there is a program called Freshman Year for Free offered by the Modern States Education Alliance. It provides free AP placement courses and pays the fee for students to take the AP tests or college-level preparation (CLEP) tests administered through the College Board. Getting the minimum AP scores a college requires to earn a college credit will lower how much you ultimately have to spend on tuition. A third option is to see if your state has a program that offers a year of free in-state community college, the credits from which can be transferred to a state university from which your child could earn their degree. Or, if you plan to go to any other college, make sure the school will accept the credits from a community college course you plan to take. No matter what steps you take, starting the research and budgeting process early can save everyone a lot of stress, debt and potential heartache in the end. Said Walker: \u201cWe have to be a lot more intentional about this purchase.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/success/how-to-find-good-affordable-colleges/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "business"}}

However, it\u2019s clear that there is something different about Dex; she\u2019s an entirely virtual \u201cdigital human,\u201d designed by a startup in the UK. For her performances, Dex is displayed on a video screen or as a holographic projection, with her mixes created by humans. She is animated using Unreal Engine \u2014 a 3D modeling software widely used in video games \u2014 combined with motion-capture. Generative artificial intelligence allows her to remember information and respond to questions, using a voice also generated by AI. \u201cShe\u2019s probably one of the only digital humans in the performance space that you can have a conversation and interact with,\u201d says Denise Harris, CCO of startup Sum Vivas. \u201cYou can ask her anything. She is a genius about music.\u201d Last month, Dex performed at Digital Fashion Weeks in New York, Paris and Milan, and she has modeled outfits by Prada and Louis Vuitton at digital fashion events. For Liverpool-based Sum Vivas she\u2019s a \u201cshowpiece\u201d for more practical applications. The company is now developing digital humans that can \u201clisten\u201d to people\u2019s questions and converse in real time. \u201cShellie\u201d can provide product information as an avatar on company websites, while \u201cArif\u201d is set to direct passengers and answer questions as a multilingual concierge on screens at airports. According to CEO and founder Rob Sims, digital humans can help bridge the gap between AI technology and people. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve found is when people start working with and conversing with a digital human, they very quickly suspend disbelief,\u201d Sims tells CNN. \u201cIt becomes natural.\u201d AI explosion Since OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT was launched in November 2022, considerable hype has surrounded the potential of generative AI \u2014 artificial intelligence powered by huge datasets of information, capable of generating text outputs in a conversational way. Record levels of investment into generative AI have followed, with over $21 billion poured into the industry during the first nine months of last year, according to data insights company Pitchbook. In March 2023, Google launched Bard (recently renamed Gemini) and around the same time Anthropic released its AI assistant Claude. As generative AI chatbots become increasingly ubiquitous, Sum Vivas is one of several companies looking to make them more human. US and New Zealand-based UneeQ has developed animated conversational \u201cdigital humans\u201d that can be used as virtual sales reps and customer service agents on company websites, and this month it debuted Sama 2.0, an animated cabin crew member that answers questions on Qatar Airways\u2019 website and app. Microsoft recently announced that users of its Azure software would be able to create lifelike avatars capable of turning text prompts into animated speech. However, there are widespread concerns about the impact AI could have on the job market.  \u201cWhen we rely on automated tools, what skills are we losing in the process?\u201d asks Jennifer Ding, senior researcher at the Alan Turing Institute, the UK\u2019s national institute for data science and artificial intelligence. \u201cIn some ways, we think of AI as something that\u2019s helping us or augmenting our work,\u201d she says. \u201cHowever, alongside, this fear of replacement is bubbling up more and more.\u201d Harris, however, points to new opportunities within digital human design and development. \u201cEvery scenario that we found, we\u2019re creating jobs and working in harmony with people rather than taking away jobs,\u201d she says. \u201cDigital humans, first and foremost, should work with other human colleagues,\u201d adds Sims. \u201cWe\u2019ll move into a stage where digital humans will start to become just another member of the team, with added benefits for that team, and obviously the customers they serve.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/business/digital-humans-ai-dj-dex-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_media_nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash", "text": "Cesar Conde has a decision to make \u2014 and it\u2019s not an especially difficult one. The NBCUniversal News Group chair is facing a torrent of backlash from his own staff after greenlighting the hire of former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel as a paid network contributor. Over the last 24 hours, the most prominent and recognizable NBC News and MSNBC personalities have voiced strong displeasure with the company\u2019s decision to welcome McDaniel to \u201cthe team.\u201d And they\u2019re not doing it via anonymous comments to the press. They\u2019re doing it on the record on NBCU\u2019s own air. Chuck Todd broke the dam on Sunday\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with a set of candid comments about the hiring, and Rachel Maddow capped the flood of backlash Monday night with a blistering 30-minute monologue eviscerating the network\u2019s leadership for the \u201cinexplicable\u201d move. Suffice to say, NBCU News Group is in unprecedented territory. Never has a network\u2019s C-suite ever been so thoroughly flogged by its most high-profile stars in such no holds barred fashion. Saying that Conde simply has a crisis on his hands would be a contender for understatement of the year. It\u2019s a five-alarm fire at NBCU News Group, and one of Conde\u2019s own making. While NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown were most directly responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring, a decision that MSNBC boss Rashida Jones did not object to it at the time, the buck ultimately stops with Conde, who hold the real power at the Peacock Network. McDaniel\u2019s hiring could not have happened without Conde\u2019s blessing. It does not take a brilliant political mind with prescient foresight to understand that hiring McDaniel would ignite a firestorm of outrage \u2014 from both within 30 Rock and outside it. Conde, someone who ostensibly supports American democracy, should have rejected McDaniel\u2019s hiring on the grounds that NBCU News Group could not put someone on its payroll who tried to subvert the 2020 vote. As so many of NBCU\u2019s staffers have underscored, the objection to McDaniel is not that she is a Republican. It\u2019s not even that she is a Donald Trump-supporting Republican. It\u2019s that she was an active participant in the plot to overthrow the last presidential election. That is not to even mention McDaniel\u2019s years of demonizing the press, smearing the journalists who work at NBC News and MSNBC as she sought to destroy the credibility of the organization that she ran to after being chased out of the RNC. The notion put forward by NBC that it needed to hire McDaniel to bring its viewers \u201can insider\u2019s perspective on national politics and the future of the Republican Party\u201d is absurd. If that\u2019s the case, the network should move to hire free agents like Tucker Carlson or Candace Owens. They too have their hands on the pulse of the Republican Party. In fact, they represent much more of where the GOP stands today than McDaniel. So, using NBC\u2019s logic, why not hire them? (Spoiler: News organizations rightfully have established basic standards for paid contributors. Asking that your employees have a commitment to democracy, to the truth, and to basic decency is not a big ask.) But even if Conde has no allegiance to basic democratic principles, which this hire calls into question, given that he is known to be a political player who cares deeply about his own image in the press, he should have been wise enough to foresee that hiring McDaniel would be an ill-conceived move. How this did not occur to Conde is unfathomable and shows a tremendous lack of judgment. Even more bizarre is Conde\u2019s management, or lack thereof, since the controversy erupted. It was clear early on that his employees at NBC News and MSNBC did not support McDaniel\u2019s hiring. If that was not evident on Friday, it was clear as day on Sunday after \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d The network\u2019s employees were not only flabbergasted and demoralized by the move, but absolutely enraged by it. At that point, the writing should have been on the wall for Conde \u2014 as it was for every other media executive that I have spoken with over the last 24 hours. It is evident that McDaniel has no real future as an NBC analyst and the decision to bring her on as a contributor will have to be reversed. After all, which NBC or MSNBC program is going to invite her on after all of this? The only real question for Conde after the Sunday morning scolding should have been how he chose to back out of the deal in the least painful way possible. To be fully honest, I very much expected a Sunday evening announcement from NBC, one that would have earned praise from the company\u2019s staff and quickly been swept away by the rush of Trump news Monday morning. But no such announcement came. Instead, Conde has allowed the mess to spiral absolutely out of control. MSNBC\u2019s top stars hammered the network\u2019s leadership throughout the day Monday over the hire. NBC News\u2019 Guild blasted Conde, saying in a statement that under him the company had quietly laid off employees over the last month and instead chosen to \u201cprioritize an election denier over its reporters.\u201d The already severe crisis was allowed to blossom into one of the worst corporate public relations catastrophes in recent memory. All the while, Conde has remained silent. I asked his spokesperson, Stephen Labaton, on Monday whether the NBCU News Group boss had any comment on the situation. Does he have any regret? I didn\u2019t get an on-the-record response. Suffice to say, however, that what Conde does moving forward will say a lot about his character and commitment to democratic values. It will also say a lot about the NBCU News Group and what type of organization it is. In her biting monologue on Monday night, however, Maddow did offer Conde a way out of this mess. \u201cMistakes will be made,\u201d Maddow said.\u201dBut our resilience as a democracy is going to be recognizing when decisions are bad ones and reversing those bad decisions. Hearing legitimate criticism, responding to it, and correcting course. Not digging in. Not blaming others. Take a minute. Acknowledge that maybe it wasn\u2019t the right call.\u201d \u201cIt is a sign of strength, not weakness, to acknowledge when you are wrong,\u201d Maddow added. \u201cIt is a sign of strength. And our country needs us to be strong now.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/media/nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_15_business_child-care-crisis-providers", "text": "For the past eight years in the small city of Waupaca, Wisconsin, Susan Elandt has been a fixture for dozens of families \u2014 taking care of their children, some as early as 4:45 a.m., so they can get to work. \u201cMost of our parents, when they drop off, are like, \u2018I could never do what you do,\u2019\u201d Elandt says. \u201cAnd my response is always, \u2018Well, I can\u2019t do what you do either! So I\u2019ll watch your kids and you go do that, because I\u2019m better at this.\u2019\u201d Elandt is the owner and operator of My First Adventure Child Care and Preschool \u2014 but only for a few more weeks. She announced in May that she\u2019s closing her doors before the end of August. \u201cIt\u2019s emotionally and physically and mentally demanding,\u201d Elandt says. \u201cThere\u2019s not benefits. The pay is not anywhere near what it should be. And we don\u2019t get a lot of professional recognition in the community, either, for the value of the work that we do.\u201d Like so many centers around the country, My First Adventure is feeling the squeeze of a child care crisis that\u2019s crippling parents and providers alike. Nationwide, the average yearly cost of care rose to $11,582 per child last year, according to Child Care Aware of America\u2019s latest\u00a0annual report. Placing two kids at a child care center cost at least 25% more than the typical rent, on average, in every state. And the tab exceeded annual\u00a0typical\u00a0mortgage payments in 45 states, plus the District of Columbia. The report looked at care for an infant and a 4-year-old. While the price of keeping children in care is sky-high, the burden of running these centers is equally unsustainable. Running a center comes with a battery of expenses, from hefty insurance policies to \u201cconsumables\u201d such as art supplies, books and food. Tight margins don\u2019t leave much room for the biggest cost \u2014 staff \u2014 which is also Elandt\u2019s biggest challenge. \u201cIf you were going to pay your teachers what they were worth even based off of basic education and experience, you would need to charge the parents so much that you would have no children in your center, no could parents afford care,\u201d she says. The basic costs of employing enough staff to comply with legal and safety requirements in child care centers are already high. The costs are also compounded by the additional expenses of fielding high staff turnover, due in large part to the low wages that these employers can afford to pay. Over the years, Elandt has struggled to keep employees because she can\u2019t compete with what\u2019s offered by local factories or even fast food restaurants. The typical hourly wage for a child care worker in Wisconsin is $13.78, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. \u201cIt\u2019s very humbling to go to work every day and pass Help Wanted signs at McDonald\u2019s and Hardee\u2019s, and they are paying more money than child care providers can afford to pay their staff,\u201d says Lydia Higgins, a teacher at My First Adventure. The child care industry got a brief boost during the Covid-19 pandemic, as federal funding allowed providers to give their staff much-needed raises and bonuses, as well as cover their rent, mortgages and utilities and buy personal protective equipment and other supplies. Elandt was able to bring up her starting salaries from $8 or $9 an hour to $12 and reward more experienced teachers, attracting and retaining enough employees to keep the center open during the depths of the pandemic. Facing a \u201cchild care cliff\u201d The historic $24 billion federal investment helped more than 225,000 providers nationwide \u2014 or more than 8 in 10 licensed child care centers \u2014 and affected as many as 10 million children. But it expired last September, leaving many centers facing what\u2019s been dubbed \u201cthe child care cliff.\u201d An analysis last year by The Century Foundation projected that more than 70,000 child care programs could close and about 3.2 million children could lose their spots due to the end of the federal child care stabilization grant program, which Congress approved as part of the 2021 American Rescue Plan Act. Multiple states have beefed up their child care investments in recent years, but it\u2019s generally not enough to keep all providers afloat. Elandt has implemented several rate increases for parents in the last year, knowing it would increase their burden. She felt there was no other choice because a return to pre-pandemic salaries would likely mean losing her whole staff. In some cases the higher wages weren\u2019t enough. A few months ago, she says, one of her employees left for a factory: \u201cShe needed to make a living.\u201d The stresses of managing a tight budget and dealing with staff turnover have taken a toll.Elandt first started thinking seriously about leaving her business two years ago and tried to sell, but no viable option emerged. In May, she made the formal announcement that this summer would be the center\u2019s last. The news left families and staff scrambling. Higgins, who is also a parent at My First Adventure, described the moment as \u201cpanic.\u201d As more and more child care providers and parents find themselves struggling through this crisis, she hopes bigger picture solutions will emerge. \u201cIt needs to start with an awareness of how critical this crisis is, and not just from the parents that are terrified and suffering through it, but as a whole picture as a whole country,\u201d Higgins said. \u201cI think everybody was really aware during the height of the pandemic, with the critical workers and things like that. I don\u2019t know if that has started to fade out for people.\u201d The city of Waupaca is actively trying to help facilitate a sale to keep the facility or re-open it under new ownership. As it stands, My First Adventure is expected to close in July. This fall will find Elandt in the public school system, where she\u2019s found joy the past few months working as a substitute teacher. Both she and Higgins say they plan to get more involved in activism to raise the voices of child care workers and fight for better conditions. \u201cWe are literally shaping tomorrow\u2019s youth,\u201d Higgins says. \u201cI think that needs to start being reflected in compensation and policies and where government funding is being directed.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/15/business/child-care-crisis-providers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "business"}}

The fast food giant says it\u2019s still working on AI-related solutions at a time when its rivals are making similar investments.

{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_judges-stern-rebuke-of-elon-musks-x-gives-researchers-fresh-hope", "text": "A federal judge\u2019s decision this week reprimanding Elon Musk\u2019s X will have reverberating effects on efforts to hold influential online platforms accountable, legal experts and advocacy groups say. On Monday, District Judge Charles Breyer dismissed and excoriated a lawsuit by X against online watchdog group Center for Countering Digital Hate as an attempt to silence the non-profit group for sounding alarms about hate speech on the platform. Breyer wrote in Monday\u2019s order that the lawsuit was \u201cunabashedly\u201d about \u201cpunishing\u201d reports written by CCDH, which X had accused of campaigning to drive away its advertisers. Breyer held that the reports were \u201cunquestionably\u201d protected by the group\u2019s free speech rights. Now, that decision could embolden other research groups and Musk critics who have faced legal threats from the billionaire. The CCDH case \u2014 in the US District Court for the Northern District of California \u2014\u00a0has been widely viewed as a bellwether for research and accountability on X, where Musk has restored the accounts of previously banned White supremacists and spreaders of misinformation and where Musk himself has amplified various conspiracy theories. And CCDH is not the only organization that has faced attacks by self-proclaimed \u201cfree speech absolutist\u201d Musk after criticizing or raising concerns about his platform. \u201cThis is an important decision that sees Elon Musk\u2019s lawsuit for what it is \u2014 an effort to punish his critics for constitutionally protected speech and to deter researchers from studying his platform,\u201d said Alex Abdo, litigation director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, which had filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the case arguing that private companies should not be allowed to use breach of contract claims to punish criticism. \u201cSociety needs reliable and ethical research into social media platforms, and often that research relies on being able to study publicly available posts,\u201d Abdo said. X said it plans to appeal Breyer\u2019s decision. Musk\u2019s threats against X critics In his first year as owner of X, formerly known as Twitter, Musk threatened legal action against the Anti-Defamation League for defamation, as well as against Microsoft and Meta for allegedly improper data and trade secret access, respectively. None of those threats ever amounted to real lawsuits. He did, however, sue the progressive media watchdog Media Matters over its\u00a0analysis\u00a0highlighting antisemitic and pro-Nazi content on X, alleging that the group\u2019s testing methodology was not representative of how real users experience the site and that the report was designed to drive away advertisers. Legal experts have described that case as \u201cweak\u201d on the merits and as a \u201cbogus\u201d attempt to chill criticism of X. This week\u2019s court decision may be only a temporary setback in Musk\u2019s wider plan to stifle criticism, said Media Matters CEO Angelo Carusone. Musk\u2019s new playbook, Carusone said, enlists the help of sympathetic Republican attorneys general to investigate independent reporting organizations and tie them up in legal proceedings. The states of Texas and Missouri each announced probes into Media Matters following X\u2019s lawsuit against the group, to which Musk responded, \u201cGreat!\u201d As recently as Monday, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey filed a petition in state court seeking to compel Media Matters\u2019 cooperation with his investigation. The filing came a week after he appeared with Musk in a live event on X \u2014 which Carusone said shows how Musk hopes to deputize the power of government to silence his critics. \u201cThey have every reason to do it,\u201d Carusone said of the AGs\u2019 investigations. \u201cThey get the political benefits, they get the attention. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any cost to them yet. And if they are successful at developing this new playbook, this new terrain, legally, then it\u2019s going to pave the way for them to just use this tool and tactic over and over and over again.\u201d A representative for X did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Carusone\u2019s claims. Researchers face hurdles to studying on-platform behavior Researchers from non-profits and academic institutions have had a harder time studying X since Musk\u2019s takeover in 2022. Academics need large samples of posts, shares, likes and other data to study social media trends in mis- and disinformation, public health, elections and other key topics. But one of Musk\u2019s first changes at X was to put access to platform data behind a steep paywall. Researchers and civil society groups said the new subscription fees \u2014 costing up to $2.5 million a year \u2014\u00a0were \u201coutrageously expensive\u201d and made it impossible to do their work, reducing transparency of a critical platform. The change may have forced some researchers to rely more heavily on first-person observational data to draw conclusions about user behavior on X. Groups like CCDH have also used automated \u201cscraping\u201d of publicly viewable content from X rather than paying the company for data directly, a tactic that helped give rise to X\u2019s initial lawsuit. Efforts by X and other social media companies to limit research transparency makes them less accountable to the public at best and, at worst, could mask malicious behavior, said David Karpf, an associate professor in the School of Media and Public Affairs at George Washington University. \u201cWe need independent research to have any real measure of what\u2019s going on at X/Twitter. Musk is only ever going to release data that makes his company look good,\u201d Karpf said. \u201cThese platforms are too big and too vital to the spread of information to be left unmonitored.\u201d \u201cThis is an election year,\u201d Karpf added, \u201cand the platforms are taking steps to make it harder to monitor how their services are used for malignant ends.\u201d Free Press, another media accountability organization that has been critical of Musk\u2019s leadership of X and which called for advertisers to pause their spending on the platform shortly after his takeover, also celebrated Breyer\u2019s ruling as potentially removing at least one hurdle that watchdog organizations face. \u201cThe guardrails for democracy are hanging by a thread and we have dwindling insights into platform practices as researchers face lawsuits, congressional subpoenas and other scare tactics,\u201d said Nora Benavidez, senior counsel and director of digital rights at Free Press. Ultimately, Benavidez called the ruling \u201ca reminder that platform accountability is essential and will inevitably prevail when up against bullies like Musk who try to silence us.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/judges-stern-rebuke-of-elon-musks-x-gives-researchers-fresh-hope/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_17_business_elon-musk-next-pay-package-tesla", "text": "Tesla shareholders on Thursday confirmed they want Elon Musk to get a massive record pay package for running Tesla for the last six years. The question now is, how much will he get going forward? The package, made up of 303 million stock options worth more than $47 billion based on the current value of Tesla shares, was thrown out in January by a judge in Delaware, where Tesla has been incorporated. Delaware Chancery Court Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick ruled in favor of a shareholder suit that the process by which Musk was awarded the options was \u201cdeeply flawed\u201d and did not pass the burden of fairness. It\u2019s not clear if even with the new shareholder vote that Musk will have the options returned to him, according to legal experts. \u201cIt\u2019s not an automatic fix. It doesn\u2019t override the decision,\u201d Samantha Crispin, partner and chair of the corporate department at global law firm Baker Botts, told CNN. \u201cThe chancellor found a number of defects in the process.\u201d But Tesla shareholders also approved moving Tesla\u2019s state of incorporation to Texas, partly in reaction to the Delaware decision. So even if the courts in Delaware continue to rule against the pay package, the Tesla board could grant a new stock option award to Musk, although there would be negative tax implications for doing so rather than simply voting to restore the earlier options. Musk, who is not paid any kind of cash salary or bonus at Tesla, has been essentially working for free for more than a year, since Tesla hit the financial targets that awarded him the last of the options available in the 2018 package. The need for more options? It is clear that Musk believes he needs to receive additional stock options. Earlier this year he said he would not want to grow Tesla to become a leader in artificial intelligence and robotics \u2014 areas where he promised growth \u2014 without a compensation plan that would\u00a0give him ownership of around 25% of the company\u2019s stock. That would be about double the roughly 13% stake he currently owns. Although, if the 303 million stock options just re-approved by shareholders are restored, and if he exercises those options, his stake would top 20%. \u201cI am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI & robotics without having ~25% voting control. Enough to be influential, but not so much that I can\u2019t be overturned,\u201d Musk tweeted in January shortly before McCormick\u2019s ruling. \u201cUnless that is the case, I would prefer to build products outside of Tesla.\u201d But Musk has suggested that the question of a new pay package would likely be delayed until questions about the 2018 package are finally settled. Musk was not asked about a new pay package at Thursday\u2019s annual shareholder\u2019s meeting, which observers might consider an absolute love fest as shareholders heaped praise on the billionaire tech mogul. But the Tesla board made clear it believes some form of significant compensation is crucial \u00a0to keeping him focused on Tesla and the challenges ahead, including his promises about making self-driving cars and humanoid robots widely available. \u201cWhat we recognized in 2018 and continue to recognize today is that one thing Elon most certainly does not have is unlimited time,\u201d Tesla board chair Robyn Denholm wrote to Tesla shareholders ahead of the most recent vote. \u201cNor does he face any shortage of ideas and other places he can make an incredible difference in the world. We want those ideas, that energy and that time to be at Tesla, for the benefit of you, our owners.\u201d Other Musk fans in the investment community also want to see him get additional shares of Tesla, even if that means their own holdings are diluted. They see Musk as the driving force behind Tesla\u2019s success, and crucial for its success into the future. Some are particularly eager to see him execute his plans for self-driving cars and robotaxis that they believe will change the economics of personal transportation even more than Tesla has changed the auto industry by spurring widespread use of EVs. \u201cThe idea of him acquiring more shares doesn\u2019t scare me,\u201d said Tasha Keeney, director of investment analysis at ARK Invest, which has the most bullish forecast for Tesla. \u201cI think look at this as an extreme pivotal moment. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to have Elon at Tesla and engaged and incentivized appropriately.\u201d Elon Musk, the first trillionaire? Musk told shareholders Thursday he\u2019s not planning on going anywhere, and said he thinks Tesla could succeed even without him, although he described himself as an \u201caccelerant\u201d to that success. It\u2019s not clear how much any additional holdings would be needed to provide Musk with financial incentives to focus on Tesla, and take him to unprecedented levels of wealth. If the company\u2019s stock does as well as Musk and his fans predict, his current holdings would appreciate in value so much that his 2018 $47 billion pay package will look like an afterthought. Ark Invest has a five-year target price for Tesla shares at $2,600 a share. That would be a 1,300% gain from its current value, something that would lift its total market cap to about $8 trillion, or more than the current values of Microsoft and Apple, combined, by 2029. Even if Musk doesn\u2019t get the options from 2018 restored, his current holdings of 411 million shares, which are today worth a mere $73 billion, would be worth more than $1 trillion if Tesla shares hit that $2,600 target. That likely would make Musk the world\u2019s first trillionaire, with his net worth rising more than the current net worths of the next five people on Bloomberg\u2019s Billionaires list \u2014 Jeff Bezos, Bernard Arnault, Mark Zuckerberg, Larry Page and Bill Gates \u2014 combined. And that doesn\u2019t even count his holdings in other companies such as SpaceX. Not everyone on that list got there through packages of stock options. For example, Bezos, the founder of Amazon, and Zuckerberg, who co-founded Facebook, both took large stakes in their companies as founders, but neither has received stock grants or options since those companies had initial public offerings in 1997 and 2012, respectively. In her decision, McCormick rejected the argument that Musk would be uncompensated if the package was thrown out, writing, \u201cMusk\u2019s preexisting equity stake provided him tens of billions of dollars for his efforts.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/business/elon-musk-next-pay-package-tesla/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_03_26_media_nbc-news-ousts-ronna-mcdaniel", "text": "NBC News on Tuesday ousted former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel, just days after her hiring as a paid political analyst sparked intense backlash from the network\u2019s top television anchors over McDaniel\u2019s role in subverting the 2020 election and attacks on the press. \u201cThere is no doubt that the last several days have been difficult for the News Group,\u201d NBCUniversal News Group President Cesar Conde said in a memo to staff. \u201cAfter listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor.\u201d \u201cI want to personally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down,\u201d Conde continued. \u201cWhile this was a collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team, I approved it and take full responsibility for it.\u201d Ahead of the network\u2019s decision, McDaniel spent the day Tuesday interviewing attorneys in preparation for a potential legal battle with NBC, a person familiar with the matter told CNN. Creative Artists Agency, the talent agency that brokered McDaniel\u2019s deal with NBC, also parted ways with her, the person said. The reversal comes after journalists and anchors at both NBC and its cable news sibling MSNBC publicly denounced the decision to hire McDaniel as a paid analyst in a stunning and unprecedented on-air rebuke of network brass that has embarrassed the Peacock Network. McDaniel, who recently stepped down from the RNC under pressure from former President Donald Trump, was involved in attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. As head of the RNC, she was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d In the years since, McDaniel continued to claim that the election had \u201cproblems\u201d and that Biden did not legitimately win the election, fanning the flames of election denialism. NBC\u2019s announcement Friday that it had hired McDaniel was quickly met with alarm by the network\u2019s journalists. The revolt spilled into public view on Sunday when McDaniel appeared on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with moderator Kristen Welker in her first interview since she was hired by the network. Welker disclosed that the interview had been scheduled to take place prior to NBC announcing McDaniel would become a paid contributor for the network, stating that she had no involvement in her hiring. Following the interview, Chuck Todd, NBC News\u2019 chief political analyst, delivered a stinging on-air criticism of NBC executives for their decision to hire McDaniel, telling Welker, \u201cI think our bosses owe you an apology for putting you in this situation.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a reason a lot of journalists at NBC News are uncomfortable with this,\u201d Todd said, explaining that under McDaniel, the RNC engaged in \u201cgaslighting\u201d and \u201ccharacter assassination\u201d when dealing with the news media. The following day, MSNBC hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough joined Todd in protesting the decision on their program \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d \u201cTo be clear, we believe NBC News should seek out conservative Republican voices to provide balance in their election coverage, but it should be conservative Republicans, not a person who used her position of power to be an anti-democracy election denier,\u201d\u00a0Brzezinski said. \u201cWe hope NBC will reconsider its decision. It goes without saying that she will not be a guest on \u2018Morning Joe\u2019 in her capacity as a paid contributor.\u201d Nicolle Wallace, host of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cDeadline: White House,\u201d later joined in the rebuke, saying on her program that the network\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel was nothing short of a potential threat to democracy. \u201cNBC News is, either wittingly or unwittingly, teaching election deniers that what they can do stretches well beyond appearing on our air and interviews to peddle lies about the sanctity and integrity of our elections,\u201d Wallace told viewers. Rachel Maddow \u2014 the network\u2019s biggest star \u2014 later devoted the first half-hour of her prime-time program to the controversy, saying the decision to hire McDaniel was \u201cinexplicable.\u201d Maddow took issue with McDaniel\u2019s long track record of demonizing the news media, labeling the press as \u201cfake news,\u201d and launching ugly attacks on NBC News journalists and MSNBC hosts. \u201cWe do not take it personally when we get attacked, when they say they want to put us on trial and execute us for treason,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so I want to associate myself with all my colleagues at MSNBC and NBC News who have voiced loud and principled objections to our company for putting on the payroll someone who hasn\u2019t just attacked us as journalists, but someone who is part of an ongoing project to get rid of our system of government,\u201d she said of McDaniel. \u201cSomeone who is still trying to convince Americans that this election stuff doesn\u2019t really work. That this last election wasn\u2019t a real result. That American elections are fraudulent.\u201c The on-air revolt ensnared NBC\u2019s top leaders, including NBCUniversal News Group chair Cesar Conde, NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown, who were responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring. MSNBC president Rashida Jones also did not object to the decision, people familiar with the matter said. In the wake of Conde\u2019s announcement to sever ties with McDaniel, MSNBC host Joy Reid and Maddow addressed the reversal on the network\u2019s air, praising the move as \u201cbold\u201d and \u201cstrong.\u201d \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/media/nbc-news-ousts-ronna-mcdaniel/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_19_success_wall-street-bonuses", "text": "Last year wasn\u2019t the most lucrative for Wall Street bankers, but their bonus payouts still easily trounced US median household income. The average Wall Street bonus for 2023 was $176,500, according to estimates that will be released Tuesday morning by New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli. That\u2019s down 2% from the $180,000 recorded in 2022. Both those averages were well below the $240,000 paid out in 2021. That the average bonus was slightly down isn\u2019t surprising. Wall Street earnings last year were mixed, and merger and acquisition activity was underwhelming. \u201cWall Street\u2019s profits were up 1.8% in 2023, but firms have taken a more cautious approach to compensation and more employees have joined the securities industry, which accounts for the slight decline in the average bonus,\u201d DiNapoli said in a statement. Nevertheless, a little perspective: The average Wall Street bonus, which comes on top of the nearly half-a-million-dollar average Wall Street salary, was itself almost 2.5 times higher than the median US household income of $74,580, according to Census data for 2022. Wall Street bonuses and general employment in the securities industry provide vital revenue streams for the New York State and New York City economies, accounting most recently for 27% of the state\u2019s tax collections and 7% of city tax revenue, according to DiNapoli\u2019s office. The securities industry \ufeffin the city employed roughly 198,500 people last year, up from 191,600 the year before. And DiNapoli estimates that 1 in 11 of the city\u2019s jobs are either directly or indirectly associated with the industry. The total estimated bonus pool for 2023 was\u00a0slightly lower than the year before and is\u00a0projected to bring in $4 million less in state income tax revenue and $2 million less for the city revenue than bonuses in 2022 did. Still, DiNapoli noted, \u201cWhile these bonuses affect income tax revenues for the state and city, both budgeted for larger declines so the impact on projected revenues should be limited.\u201d It should be noted that the comptroller\u2019s numbers only reflect the bonuses paid to securities industry employees working for firms based in New York City. Beyond bringing in tax revenue for government coffers, Wall Street workers contribute substantially to the local Gotham economy. DiNapoli said that more employees in financial services (65%) are working in-office on any given day compared to 58% working in other industries in the city, at least as of September 2023. And that securities industry employees use the subway more than other workers in the city. All in, he estimates that Wall Street is responsible for roughly 14% of economic activity in the city. As critical as that is, the city and state are about much more than just Wall Street. \u201cThe securities industry\u2019s continued strength should not overshadow the broader economic picture in New York, where we need all sectors to enjoy full recovery from the pandemic,\u201d DiNapoli said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/19/success/wall-street-bonuses/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_17_media_alex-jones-infowars-shut-down", "text": "Alex Jones\u2019\u00a0notorious\u00a0conspiracy\u00a0platform Infowars may have survived a\u00a0key decision from a federal judge last week, but the platform\u2019s future is far from secure. A bankruptcy judge in Houston on Friday allowed Jones to liquidate his personal assets to help pay the nearly $1.5 billion that he owes the families of the Sandy Hook massacre victims but dismissed the\u00a0separate\u00a0bankruptcy\u00a0case\u00a0of Infowars\u2019 parent company Free Speech Systems. The dismissal is not a reflection on Jones or whatever the judge might feel about Infowars. Rather, it was a question of economic reality \u2013 how the judge could help the families get the most value out of Jones and Infowars. \u201cThis case is one of the more difficult cases I\u2019ve had,\u201d Judge Christopher\u00a0Lopez said during a lengthy and at times emotional ruling. \u201cI was never asked today to make a decision to shut down a show or not. That was never going to happen today one way or another.\u201d What the judge decided Lopez approved Jones\u2019 request to liquidate his personal assets to help pay off his debts, but dismissed a request to \u201cconvert\u201d Free Speech Systems\u2019 bankruptcy to liquidation. Some of the Sandy Hook families had requested the judge move to liquidate Jones\u2019 Free Speech Systems company. They\u00a0argued it would not only dismantle a platform that had caused so much agony but would also ensure a fair way to dole out the proceeds of a sell-off. But\u00a0a\u00a0handful of\u00a0other families had argued against liquidation. The reasoning: Liquidation is a lengthy and costly process, and the families have yet to see a dime from the more than a billion dollars Jones owes them. Lopez noted that this may be one of the longest-running cases of its kind in the country. Because the company is not in liquidation, the families can immediately go after Free Speech System\u2019s assets in state courts, a much faster and less costly process (liquidation would have involved various bankruptcy professionals who take a lot of fees). \u201cI have to do what\u2019s in the best interest of credito\ufeffrs,\u201d Lopez said on Friday, adding, \u201cWhen you look at it, I think creditors are better served in pursuing their state court rights.\u201d Since Jones is the owner of Free Speech Systems, and Jones himself is in bankruptcy, the families can go after the company\u2019s assets. In a sadly ironic twist, the more money Jones makes by broadcasting his lies and conspiracy theories on Infowars, the more of the nearly $1.5 billion he owes to the families could actually be paid. What happens to Infowars For now, nothing changes for Jones\u2019 Infowars shows. The company can continue operating, and Jones is free to say what he wants \u2013 including commenting about Sandy Hook \u2013 as he wishes. But Jones\u2019 personal stake in the company is part of his own personal liquidation. Because of Jones\u2019 bankruptcy, Free Speech Systems is now in the hands of a court-appointed trustee. It\u2019s not clear what that trustee will do - either keep Free Speech Systems operating or sell it off. \u201cI do not now own Infowars,\u201d Jones said during an \u201cemergency\u201d show on Saturday. \u201cIt is now controlled by the court trustee. I am the CEO and the decision maker.\u201d Jay Westbrook,\u00a0a University of Texas bankruptcy law professor, said\u00a0the personal bankruptcy trustee will take over Jones\u2019s interest in Free Speech Systems. \u201c(The trustee) will work to maximize the value of Jones\u2019s shares for the benefit of his creditors, including the possibility of selling Jones\u2019s shares,\u201d Westbrook said. Jones said on Saturday he estimates the company has up to five more months before some sort of sale. \u201cIf we make it a few more months\u2026 if we make it that, we\u2019ll survive, under new management and ownership but I\u2019ll still be as host here, I\u2019ll still be in control of what I say or I won\u2019t be here,\u201d Jones said on Saturday. \u201cBut we just got more runway. It\u2019s like in a video game where you\u2019re down to one life, you get another life.\u201d What happens next Still uncertain is what sort of power the court-appointed trustee has over Free Speech Systems. Lopez will likely schedule a new hearing to determine the trustee\u2019s powers. But no matter what happens to the company, Jones still owes nearly $1.5 billion. If Free Speech Systems continues operating and making money for Jones, those funds will ultimately need to go to paying the families. \u201cOnce Jones\u2019s bankruptcy case ends, the families can start to use state court collection tools (garnishment, attachment, foreclosure) to get paid from income that Jones earns and any property he acquires since he filed for bankruptcy until their judgments are paid in full,\u201d Marie Reilly, professor of bankruptcy law at Penn State University, told CNN. While Jones now acknowledges the Sandy Hook massacre took place, he is free to continue espousing dangerous rhetoric and conspiracy theories on his platforms.In recent days, Jones has fantasized on his show about executing\u00a0Dr. Anthony Fauci, the former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,\u00a0and others who supposedly \u201clied to\u00a0Trump.\u201d But even if Infowars is shut down, Jones can continue posting on his X account after it was restored last year by Elon Musk or join other high-profile platforms. Earlier this month, Tucker Carlson, the far-right former Fox News host, announced Jones would join him for a stop on his upcoming national live speaking tour. Days later, Jones was quietly dropped from the tour without explanation.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/media/alex-jones-infowars-shut-down/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_22_media_ronna-mcdaniel-nbc", "text": "NBC News on Friday announced that it had hired Ronna McDaniel, the former Republican National Committee chair who has repeatedly\u00a0attacked the network and its journalists,\u00a0assailed the\u00a0news\u00a0media as \u201cfake news\u201d and promoted false claims around the 2020\u00a0vote,\u00a0as an on-air commentator\u00a0ahead of the 2024 presidential election. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be a more important moment to have a voice like Ronna\u2019s on the team,\u201d Carrie Budoff Brown, senior vice president of politics at NBC News, said in a memo\u00a0to staff. McDaniel exited the RNC earlier this month after leading the organization since 2016. During her time as chair, McDaniel repeatedly attacked the press, which has become increasingly popular in Republican circles over the last several years as Donald Trump demonizes journalists and news institutions. McDaniel echoed many such attacks, labeling the press as \u201cfake news\u201d and calling the media \u201ccorrupt.\u201d At times, she even targeted NBC News\u00a0and MSNBC\u00a0with dishonest attacks. In 2019, for instance, McDaniel accused Richard Engel, NBC News\u2019 chief foreign correspondent, of \u201cactively cheering for an economic downturn.\u201d \u201cHow can NBC let him keep his job when he\u2019s made his bias so clear?\u201d McDaniel asked. McDaniel has a lengthier history attacking the progressive cable news channel MSNBC, which she will appear on in her new role. In recent years, she has repeatedly attacked the channel for \u201cspreading lies\u201d and blasted those she described as the network\u2019s \u201cprimetime propagandists.\u201d An NBC spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment about her attacks on the news media and NBC. In her role as RNC chief, McDaniel also fanned the flames of election denialism after the 2020 presidential contest. McDaniel was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d The Michigan Department of State\u2019s office condemned her claims of supposed voter fraud in the wake of the election, stating they had \u201cno merit.\u201d\u00a0The state\u2019s \u201celections were conducted fairly, effectively and transparently and are an accurate reflection of the will of Michigan voters,\u201d it said in a\u00a0detailed fact check\u00a0posted online. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Chris Wallace last year, McDaniel defended her claims of voting \u201cirregularity\u201d in the election. \u201cI think saying that there were problems with 2020 is very real. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s election denying,\u201d McDaniel told Wallace. \u201cI\u2019m from Wayne County. We had a woman send a note saying I\u2019m being told to backdate ballots. We had to look into that. That\u2019s deeply concerning. When you have friends who are poll-watching and being kicked out, that\u2019s deeply concerning. We have every right to look at that.\u201d In the interview,\u00a0Wallace pressed McDaniel if she believed Biden legitimately won the election. \u201cI think there were lots of problems with 2020. Ultimately, he won the election\u00a0but there were lots of problems with the 2020 election,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think he won it fair. I don\u2019t. I\u2019m not going to say that.\u201d NBC\u2019s hiring of McDaniel, however, plays into a recent trend at the\u00a0network\u2019s outlets, which has seemingly softened its stance on Trump as he inches toward the Republican nomination for president. Earlier this month, CNBC hosted Trump for a lengthy phone interview in which the network\u2019s anchors allowed him to peddle lies and conspiracy theories on air\u00a0without scrutiny. MSNBC has even started carrying Trump\u2019s remarks live on television, a practice that the network boasted for years it would not do. Star host Rachel Maddow, who has said carrying Trump\u2019s lies\u00a0on the air\u00a0is dangerous, even objected to the network broadcasting a recent speech from the presumptive Republican nominee, calling it \u201cirresponsible.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/22/media/ronna-mcdaniel-nbc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_20_success_interest-rates-savings-cash", "text": "The Federal Reserve\u2019s benchmark interest rate remains at a 23-year high. That\u2019s thanks to the central bank\u2019s decision Wednesday to once again hold it steady, as it has done at the policy-making committee\u2019s past five meetings. That decision may be disappointing to some investors, homebuyers and those with a lot of credit card debt, since movement in the Fed\u2019s overnight lending rate influences rates \u2014 directly or indirectly \u2014 on consumer financial products (e.g., credit cards, bank loans and mortgages). But\u00a0with the Fed signaling that no rate cuts are likely until summer, it also means anyone with savings still has at least a few more months to make hay of their stash. That\u2019s because you can still get inflation-beating interest rates that will grow any money you have set aside for emergencies, vacations, down payments or any other goal in your sights over the next several years. However, that won\u2019t happen if you just let it sit in a traditional checking or savings account that yields next to nothing. There are more lucrative, low-risk options out there, with rates that are still at or near their peaks. \u201cBut perhaps not for much longer,\u201d said Ted Rossman, senior analyst at Bankrate. \u201cIf one of those fits into your financial plans, it\u2019s best to act soon.\u201d So, consider the following options when deciding where to park your hard-earned savings. High-yield online savings accounts The average annual percentage yield on bank savings accounts was just 0.52% as of March 13, according to Bankrate. That average is kept low by the biggest brick-and-mortar banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, which still are offering a paltry 0.01%. By contrast, there are still FDIC-insured online banks offering inflation-beating rates of between 4.35% and 5.35% on their high-yield savings accounts. Generally speaking, these are the best vehicles in which to keep your emergency funds for quick, easy access. Choosing between an account that pays 0.52% and one that pays 5.35% can mean forfeiting hundreds of dollars in interest. \u201cIf you put $10,000 in a savings account, that\u2019s a difference of $496 in interest earnings over the course of the year, assuming monthly compounding,\u201d Rossman said. While the rates on high-yield savings accounts have gone down a bit in recent months, \u201cwidespread cuts in online savings account rates are unlikely until the first Fed rate cut is near,\u201d said Ken Tumin, founder of DepositAccounts.com. As with any bank savings rate, high-yield savings account\u00a0rates\u00a0can change overnight, and the bank may not alert you when it lowers it. So make sure to check your monthly statement. Certificates of deposits Another high-return, low-risk investment that is great for money you likely won\u2019t need to tap for a few months or even a couple of years is a certificate of deposit. You can get the best returns on CDs through a brokerage such as Schwab, E*Trade or Fidelity. That\u2019s because you can comparison shop for CDs from any number of FDIC-insured banks and will not have to set up individual accounts with each institution. As of March 13, the average rate on a one-year CD was 1.95%, but some banks are offering as much are 5.4%. If you can get a one-year CD at, say, 5.4%, you will make $540 on a $10,000 investment. To get the greatest benefit from a CD, you have to leave the money invested for a fixed period. You can always access your principal sooner if you need to, but there may be early withdrawal penalties. As of March 20, CDs listed on Schwab.com with durations from three months up to three years were all yielding between 5.2% and 5.51%. CD rates on durations between four and 10 years ranged from 4.40% to 5.15%. Say you invest $10,000 in a one-year CD with a 5.36%\u00a0APY. At the end of that period, you\u2019d get your principal back plus $536 in interest when the CD matures, according to Bankrate\u2019s CD calculator. If you chose a two-year CD at 5.25%, you\u2019d bank an extra $1,078, assuming compounding interest. The same investment in a five-year CD at 5.15% would earn $2,854. \u201cIt makes sense to go long with CDs. To hedge your bets, include terms from one to five years. Starting a CD ladder will provide this mix,\u201d Tumin said. If you don\u2019t go through a brokerage you may get a reasonable deal from your primary bank, Tumin said. For example, he noted, Wells Fargo is still offering up to 5.01% on both 4-month and 7-month CDs. Or, at Bank of America, you can get up to 4.75% on a 7-month CD. But Tumin cautions that with any big bank CD you should take your money out at the end of the term, otherwise your bank may automatically renew it and lock you in to a much lower-yielding CD. Money market accounts and funds If you don\u2019t want to set up an online savings account at another bank, your own bank may offer you a money market deposit account that pays a higher yield than your regular checking or savings accounts. Money market accounts may have higher minimum deposit requirements than a regular savings account, but they are more liquid than a fixed-term certificate of deposit or Treasury bill, meaning they give you access to your money more quickly while still potentially giving you some of the highest yields available, said Doug Ornstein, senior manager for integrated solutions at TIAA Wealth Management. But don\u2019t confuse money market accounts with money market mutual funds, which invest in short-term, low-risk debt instruments. As of March 19, they had an average 7-day yield of 5.14%, according to the Crane Money Fund Index, which tracks the top 100 taxable money market funds. Unlike money market deposit accounts, money market mutual funds are not insured by the FDIC. But if you invest in a money market fund through a brokerage, your overall account is likely to be insured through the Securities Investor Protection Corp, which offers protection in the event your brokerage ever goes under. Treasury bills and notes Another option for money you can leave untouched anywhere from several months to a few years is to buy short-term Treasury bills and medium-term notes, which are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. Three- and six-month bills had yields of 5.39% and 5.33%\u00a0respectively on March 20 before the Fed\u2019s meeting ended, while nine-month and one-year bills were offering 5.19% and 5.08%\u00a0respectively, according to rates posted on Schwab.com for a $25,000 investment. Rates on Treasury notes with durations from two years to 10 years ranged between 4.29% and 4.72%. If you\u2019re someone who manages your portfolio like a hawk, you may feel comfortable buying T-bills on your own from TreasuryDirect.gov. But if you don\u2019t, it might be easier just to buy new issues through your brokerage account or invest in a short-term bond index fund or ETF, said Andy Smith, executive director of financial planning at Edelman Financial Engines. And if you\u2019re looking at money that will be needed in three to five years, you might consider a diversified fund of highly rated government and corporate bonds, Ornstein said. An 18-month AAA-rated corporate bond, for instance, was yielding 4.82% this week, while the three-year was at 4.49%. Meanwhile, three-year AAA-rated municipal bonds (which are issued by local governments) had a rate of 3.98%, according to Schwab.com. Don\u2019t chase yield When deciding on the best accounts and investments for your specific goals and peace of mind, it may pay to consult a fee-only fiduciary adviser \u2014 meaning, someone who doesn\u2019t get paid a commission to sell you a particular investment. What you\u2019ll always want to do is build in flexibility for yourself so you can easily access cash, regardless of your timeline for key goals. \u201cWhat happens if something changes and you need that down payment a lot sooner \u2014 or your parents need medical care fast?\u201d Smith said. That means balancing your desire for great yield with a need and desire for ease of access without penalty. Translation: Don\u2019t chase yield for yield\u2019s sake. Think of it this way, Ornstein said: Unless you have huge sums to invest or are an institutional investor, the difference between getting a 5.1% yield versus 5% is negligible, and in fact it could even cost you more if there are penalties for taking your money out early. \u201cMost of the time convenience is really important. Give up the 0.1%,\u201d he advised.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/20/success/interest-rates-savings-cash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2022_04_27_business_diamonds-manmade-demand", "text": "It\u2019s proposal season, and engagements are on the rise. So are factory-made diamond sales. Not that you\u2019d know the difference. Man-made diamonds look the same as naturally occurring ones. The only noticeable difference is the price tag. \u201cThe result is really stunning,\u201d said Edahn Golan, an independent diamond industry analyst. He said March data showed the number of engagement rings sold that featured a manufactured diamond jumped 63% compared to last year, while the number of engagement rings sold with a natural diamond declined 25% in the same period. Going back by another month, to February, the data showed the number of rings sold with lab diamonds that month surged even more, to 80% compared to a year earlier while the number fell by 13% for natural diamond engagement rings.  \u201cThe big fear in the natural diamonds industry is that consumers will start accepting lab-grown diamonds in engagement rings,\u201d he said. Too late. \u201cIt\u2019s actually happening.\u201d  Tide is shifting Why are consumers flocking to man-made diamonds? Cost is the most obvious reason. The average retail price of the most popular one carat round man-made diamond for an engagement ring in March was $2,318, Golan said. \u201cThis is substantially less \u2013 as much as 73% cheaper \u2013 than a natural diamond of the same size, cut and clarity as the man-made diamond, which would cost $8,740,\u201d he said. Plus, the lower cost allows couples to buy a bigger stone.  \u201cA lab diamond is a real diamond, but maybe it took a few weeks to make it,\u201d said Golan. \u201cNatural diamonds were formed over 800 million to three billion years and there isn\u2019t an infinite supply of them.\u201d  This makes natural diamonds quite a bit more expensive, and prices are likely to rise as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has tightened the supply chain for natural raw diamonds. The sanctions directly target Alrosa, partly owned by the Russian government, which the US government identified as the world\u2019s largest diamond mining company, accounting for 28% of global diamond output. Man-made diamonds are also becoming popular as consumers are more aware and educated about them, said Dan Moran, a third-generation diamond expert and owner of LA-based fine jeweler Concierge Diamonds. Moran said the typical buyer of man-made diamonds is typically younger than 40 and very budget conscious. Mined diamonds have a controversial history that\u2019s tied to the use of child labor in some African diamond mines as well as sales of illegally-traded \u201cconflict diamonds\u201d that fund conflict in war-torn areas. Among Millennials and Gen Z, their eco-conscious mindset and ethical concerns about natural diamond sourcing is another factor influencing their preference for non-traditional engagement rings, according to a report from wedding planning website The Knot. Small but growing share of the diamond market Although its slice is growing, the market share for man-made diamonds remains relatively small. Currently, about 7% of the specialty diamond jewelry market is represented by man-made diamonds, up from 3% in 2020, said Golan.  Some major jewelry retailers are driving the effort to take man-made diamonds mainstream. In 2021, the world\u2019s largest jewelry company, Pandora\n            \n                (PANDY), made a major shift by announcing it would stop using mined diamonds and would swap to lab-created diamonds in its jewelry.  Pandora said it\u2019s instituting the change as part of an effort to sell sustainable jewelry, and also because consumers increasingly are asking for it. Signet,\n            \n                (SIG) the largest jewelry company in the United States (which owns Zales, Kay Jewelers and Jared chains) called out the popularity of lab diamond jewelry in its March earnings call with analysts. Calling it a \u201cfast-growing category\u201d in its jewelry portfolio, Signet CEO Virginia Drosos told analysts that lab-created diamonds are among the big jewelry trends she expects this year.  The company said it has expanded its man-made bridal jewelry selection in both its Zales and Kay Jewelers stores in response to the increased demand.  Fine jewelry brand Charles and Colvard, which makes lab-created diamonds, said consumers don\u2019t just want to look good with the jewelry they are wearing, they also want to feel good about it. \u201cAs the momentum for conscious consumerism grows, the surge towards lab grown diamonds isn\u2019t surprising,\u201d said Don O\u2019Connell, president and CEO of Charles & Colvard. \u201c[Consumers] want to know the origins of their stones and be reassured they\u2019re conflict-free. They\u2019re embracing the choice to purchase a piece of fine jewelry that aligns with their values.\u201d Lab-grown diamond brand VRAI said the pandemic, too, has sparked attention and action toward social and environmental issues. It said consumers are being more thoughtful and reassessing their purchasing habits, as well as the companies and industries they are supporting. There is, however, one important consideration for anyone buying lab-created diamonds: Man-made diamonds have little resale value.  So while you may not be able to tell a natural diamond from a factory made variety, someone with a trained eye can, said Golan. Once a stone is identified as a factory diamond, even though you paid a lot less for it, you also won\u2019t get much for it.  But the value of a ring isn\u2019t just monetary. \u201cAs a professional in the industry, I am asked all the time by people about what I think about a ring they have,\u201d said Moran, of Concierge Jewelers. \u201cI always say, if you love it, be happy with it. An engagement ring is a symbol of commitment and enduring love.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/27/business/diamonds-manmade-demand/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_16_food_fudgie-the-whale-carvel-history", "text": "Whiskey, steaks and ties are all typical gifts for Father\u2019s Day, but one specifically made for the holiday takes the cake: Fudgie the Whale. Carvel\u2019s vanilla and chocolate-flavored ice cream cake has been a holiday staple since 1977, when it it was first created as a Father\u2019s Day promotion, and nearly five decades later, it has earned its place in the pantheon of recognizable fast food characters. Fudgie the Whale wasn\u2019t initially produced to be a mascot for the 90-year-old brand. It was made to fill the freezer cases that founder Tom Carvel had made for his shops. Ice cream cakes quickly flew off the shelves, first created in the mid-1950s, and twenty years later he thought of making a cake for Father\u2019s Day. Fudgie was a play on the phrase (more commonly said back then): a \u201cwhale of a dad,\u201d according to Carvel\u2019s Chief Brand Officer Jim Salerno, which prompted Carvel to mass produce Fudgie using a plastic, whale-shaped mold that he invented. He decided to top it with fudge, because it was one of Carvel\u2019s most popular toppings. To make the cake, soft-serve vanilla is placed into the mold first, followed by chocolate chip cookie pieces better known as \u201ccrunchies.\u201d Then it\u2019s topped with soft-serve chocolate ice cream and frozen for several hours. After that, it\u2019s topped with hot fudge with more crunchies on the side. The cakes sell for about $30. Fudgie helped Father\u2019s Day become Carvel\u2019s busiest day of the year for buying cakes, Salerno said. \u201cThe simple reason is when you ask dad what they want to do on Father\u2019s Day is that they want to stay home, like watch TV or have a barbecue. It\u2019s a big holiday to bring cake home,\u201d Salerno told CNN. Fudgie\u2019s popularity extends beyond Father\u2019s Day, Salerno said, popular for other occasions like birthdays and anniversaries, too. Carvel sells nearly 100,000 Fudgies a year. Fudgie is also part of fading piece of fast food culture, as mascots have largely become a thing of the past. They have been \u201csuccessful in reaching kids and families with a memorable character that could then recreate some nostalgia and a fondness for the food and the memories of that chain,\u201d said David Henkes, a senior principal at Technomic, a food industry research and consulting firm. Carvel could use a boost. Its footprint has deceased in recent years and sales lag behind its competitors like Dairy Queen and Baskin Robbins, according to the firm\u2019s data. Carvel is owned by privately held Go To Foods (f.k.a. Focus Brands) that also has Auntie Anne\u2019s, Jamba and Cinnabon in its portfolio. \u201cFor Carvel, Fudgie the Whale cakes evoke those same memories and nostalgia for consumers those that are from the East Coast, and for a relatively small regional chain Fudgie has worked its way into pop culture and probably helps keep Carvel more top of mind for consumers,\u201d he told CNN. Sibling rivalry Although Fudgie is Carvel\u2019s most famous treat, it has a little known sibling rivalry with Cookie Puss \u2014 a goofy looking alien with a sugar cone as a nose. That was actually Carvel\u2019s first shaped cake, created about five years before Fudgie, to complement the chain\u2019s ice cream sandwiches, known as Flying Saucers. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be an extra-terrestrial, but some people say that they kind of fashioned it to look like Tom because it has a nice big nose, big eyes and big ears,\u201d Salerno teased. \u201cBut when Fudgie came along, Fudgie surpassed Cookie Puss very quickly.\u201d Cookie Puss remains on sale, as well as other shaped cakes like ice cream cones, bunny rabbits for Easter and various sports-themed cakes, like basketball and baseball. Fudgie\u2019s mold has dual purpose to, Salerno said noting that the late Tom Carvel (he died in 1990) \u201cwas very frugal\u201d and turned it sideways to make a Santa Claus cake, which has been on sale for about four decades. The Fudgie family expanded this year with the introduction of Fudgie Pops, which are mini Fudgie cake pops on a stick. Later this year, Carvel is introducing another new character cake, but Salerno is keeping mum on the shape. Fudgie fandom Carvel has about 340 locations, with more than half of them in New York, but Fudgie\u2019s fandom extends beyond the state. It\u2019s been lovingly joked about on several TV shows including Family Guy, The Office and even The Simpsons. Last October, Kelly Ripa, a big Carvel fan, received a Fudgie cake on her nationally syndicated talk show \u201cLive with Kelly and Mark\u201d for her 53rd birthday. Fudgie is hard to escape: Fudgie mascot has made appearances at New York Mets\u2019 and Yankees games, he\u2019s appeared in TV commercials and was even made into Fudgie the Beer in 2018 as part of a limited-time promotion. For Carvel, which is celebrating its 90th year this year with a new logo and refreshed store designs to focus on its soft serve ice cream roots (Carvel claims that its founder has invented that, but others might disagree), Fudgie sparks nostalgia for consumers. \u201cWe as a brand made sure to keep him front and center,\u201d Salerno said. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how well-known and how well loved he is.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/16/food/fudgie-the-whale-carvel-history/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_06_17_media_surgeon-general-social-media-apps-warning-label", "text": "Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy said the threat social media poses to children requires urgent action, and he demanded Congress to put a label on the apps as it does with cigarettes and alcohol. \u201cThe mental health crisis among young people is an emergency \u2014 and social media has emerged as an important contributor,\u201d Murthy said in an op-ed in the New York Times Monday. Murthy cited several studies, including a 2019 American Medical Association study published in JAMA that showed teens who spend three hours a day on social media double their risk of depression. Teens spend nearly five hours a day on social media apps, according to a Gallup poll. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Meg Tirrell, Murthy said that the prevalence of social media use among kids is over 95%, \u201cnearly universal.\u201d But Murthy cannot act unilaterally to put a warning label on apps \u2014 that requirement would have to come from Congress, with whom Murthy pleaded to pass a bill. \u201cI put forward this call for a warning because I think it\u2019s essential that parents know what we now know, which is that there are significant harms associated with social media use,\u201d Murthy told CNN. Similar labels on tobacco, first instituted in 1965, led to a steady decline in cigarette smoking in America over the past several decades. Congress has long chastised social media companies, claiming they pose harm to children. CEOs of tech companies have been grilled routinely on Capitol Hill, most notably Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg \u2014 who publicly apologized to families whose children killed themselves because of online bullying and harassment. But Congress has taken little action to curb children\u2019s social media usage. Murthy argued that it\u2019s time for Congress to get serious about curbing children\u2019s use of social media. \u201cUntil that point in time, when we have reliable evidence that tells us social media is safe and changes are being made and will be made in the future\u2026 parents deserve to be warned. That\u2019s where the label comes in,\u201d Murthy told CNN, adding that he hopes Congress will introduce legislation to add a surgeon general\u2019s warning label on social media as soon as possible. \u201cI think this is an urgent issue.\u201d An escalating battle Murthy has warned about social media\u2019s harm to children\u2019s welfare for years. But Monday\u2019s declaration of an emergency and his appeal to Congress represent his most urgent call to action on the issue so far. In May 2023, Murthy issued an advisory that said there\u2019s not enough evidence to determine whether social media is safe enough for children and adolescents\u2019 mental health, saying social media use presents \u201ca profound risk of harm\u201d for kids. He suggested parents restrict their kids\u2019 social media use, saying 13 is too young to join social apps. But such advisories are designed to call attention to urgent public health \u2013 they don\u2019t require action. \u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of a youth mental health crisis, and I\u2019m concerned that social media is contributing to the harm that kids are experiencing,\u201d Murthy told CNN in May 2023. \u201cFor too long, we have placed the entire burden of managing social media on the shoulders of parents and kids, despite the fact that these platforms are designed by some of the most talented engineers and designers in the world to maximize the amount of time that our kids spend on them.\u201d On CNN\u2019s \u201cChasing Life\u201d podcast with Dr. Sanjay Gupta in June 2023, Murthy outlined some steps parents can take to rein in their children\u2019s social media usage, including partnering with other parents to make sure kids lack the \u201cI\u2019m the only one without social media\u201d excuse. More action needed A warning label, if Congress passes legislation requiring one, would be insufficient to fix the problem, Murthy acknowledged. He suggested schools become phone-free environments for children, as should dinner time and other family events. And Murthy urged parents to restrict children\u2019s use of social media until they graduate from middle school. Several states have worked to pass legislation to increase the age at which children can begin to use social apps or some of their more time-sucking features, such as algorithms that push people to engage with more content within the app. The bills have been largely bipartisan. Florida\u2019s Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in March signed a bill that would prohibit children under 14 from obtaining their own social media accounts, and children under 16 would need parental consent to have accounts. New York Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul said she would sign legislation passed by the state legislature that would ban social media from using algorithms in children\u2019s feeds, and the bill would also prevent tech companies from sharing information of children under 18. \u201cThis is much easier said than done, which is why parents should work together with other families to establish shared rules, so no parents have to struggle alone or feel guilty when their teens say they are the only one who has to endure limits,\u201d Murthy wrote in the New York Times. On Monday, Murthy confirmed to CNN that alcohol and cigarettes are currently the only two products with surgeon general warning labels but that the overall health risk of social media is \u201cjust as profound.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re talking about the mental health and wellbeing of kids,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/media/surgeon-general-social-media-apps-warning-label/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "business"}}

Chestnut won the \u201cMustard Yellow Belt\u201d 16 times, ate a world record 76 hot dogs and buns in 10 minutes in 2021 and has reportedly made hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of dollars for his competitive eating of hot dogs and other foods.  MLE co-founder George Shea said the company tried to accommodate Chestnut and his management team, which included allowing him to compete in a rival unbranded hot dog eating contest on Labor Day. \u201cIt\u2019s a long-standing rule not to represent a rival brand,\u201d Shea said. \u201cMichael Jordan can\u2019t go to Adidas and say that Air Jordans are great.\u201d The MLE has also emphasized that Chestnut was not banned for life from competing, citing his 20-year relationship with the league. The organization said that to come back Chestnut must renounce deals with brands that rival Nathan\u2019s. \u201cJoey Chestnut is an American hero. We would love nothing more than to have him at Nathan\u2019s Famous International Hot Dog Eating Contest, which he has dominated for years. We hope that he returns when he is not representing a rival brand,\u201d the MLE said in a statement.

This is not the first instance of Nathan\u2019s beefing with their winners. Chestnut\u2019s rival and former reigning champion Takeru Kobayashi did not compete in the 2010 contest, reportedly due to disputes with the company over getting him to sign an exclusive contract.

{"id": "2024_06_15_economy_good-news-inflation-may", "text": "\u201cGood news is bad news\u201d has been a common refrain for a while now. When economic reports are released that are solid, they have all too often been clouded with concerns that good news for the economy actually means a longer wait before the Federal Reserve rolls out rate cuts. This week, a string of good news was actually good news: Closely watched inflation gauges showed prices had cooled more than anticipated; Americans\u2019 financial outlooks were rosier than they have been in years while their inflation expectations dipped; and, on Friday, US import prices reversed course and fell sharply, adding fuel to the disinflationary fire. \u201cWhat we saw in the data is a reaffirmation of the idea that the economy, hiring, inflation are all cooling, which should create the conditions later this year for the Federal Reserve to relax their restrictive policy rate,\u201d said Joe Brusuelas, principal and chief economist for RSM US. \u201cAnd long-term interest rates will come down, which means the cost of financing, to purchase a car, a dishwasher or a washing machine or dryer, all will fall.\u201d He added: \u201cThat is good news.\u201d This week \u2014 with its multiple inflation reports, a Fed meeting, a new central bank rate cut timeline and economic projections, and a slew of ancillary data \u2014 had the makings of being a market-mover and a foreteller of the economic trajectory. And it sure did deliver. On Monday, new survey data from the New York Fed showed that US consumers reported increased optimism about their current and future financial situation, the stock market and the continued slowing of inflation. On Tuesday, the National Federation of Independent Business\u2019 optimism index hit the highest level of the year (although firms\u2019 uncertainty rose as well). But those data points were small fry as to what would come Wednesday. Inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index cooled more than expected in May, with prices holding flat on the month for the first time since July 2022. On an annual basis, consumer prices rose 3.3% from a year earlier,\u00a0slowing from April\u2019s 3.4% rate, Falling gas prices did their part, as did stable grocery prices, but a key gauge of underlying inflation also cooled. Core CPI rose just 0.2% for the month (its slowest pace since October of last year), and its annual rate dropped to 3.4%, setting a fresh three-year low. \u201cThe disinflationary trend we saw in 2023 is reasserting itself in that the seasonal noise that we typically see in inflation at the turn of the year was just that, \u2018noise,\u2019\u201d Brusuelas said. The soft CPI bolstered traders\u2019 expectations that interest rate cuts could now come as soon as September. The Fed, putting on its hawkish hat, tried to play spoilsport later that afternoon when it held rates at their current levels once again, and officials signaled only one rate cut for the remainder of the year, down from the three penciled in last December. The markets don\u2019t seem to be buying the one-cut plan, especially after the Producer Price Index on Thursday showed that wholesale prices fell from April to May and the BLS\u2019 Import and Export Price Index showed that US imports prices fell 0.4% in May after rising 0.9% in April. Excluding gas prices, imports still fell 0.3%. \u201cEverywhere Fed officials look, inflation is now in a cooldown phase after the worrisome first quarter flare-up,\u201d Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FwdBonds, wrote in a note on Friday. \u201cFed officials did not see what they were hoping for in the inflation trend when they met earlier this week, but the winds of change are coming for those bearish inflation outlooks as the economy may be slowing more than expected at the end of the second quarter.\u201d \u201cWe would not rule out a first rate cut in September; the market is not,\u201d Rupkey wrote. And more good news is likely on the way this next week and later this month, Brusuelas said. Inflation growing at a slower rate will give Americans more comfort in terms of overall spending, he said, adding that should be on display in next week\u2019s retail sales report. Additionally, the disinflation seen in the CPI and PPI are setting the stage for an equally softer report from the Fed\u2019s favored inflation gauge: The Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, which is due out at the end of the month.  \u201cThere\u2019s a real possibility we could see no increase on a monthly basis and that inflation slows into the 2.5% to 2.6% range,\u201d he said. \u201cAt that point, you\u2019re within spitting distance of the Fed\u2019s 2% target, and we have to seriously be talking about rate cuts in the near term.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/15/economy/good-news-inflation-may/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_business_menu-prices-rising", "text": "Grocery prices stayed flat in May, after ticking down the month before. But menu prices, a source of frustration for budget-conscious consumers, are still going up \u2014 even as restaurants brag about their discounted meals. Menu prices rose 0.4% at sit-down restaurants from April to May, adjusted for seasonal swings, according to inflation data released Wednesday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In that time prices ticked up 0.2% at limited service spots, which include fast casual and fast food joints. The difference between grocery increases and menu price inflation was more pronounced for the full year. Grocery prices rose 1% in the 12 months through May. In that period, menu prices at full-service, or sit-down, restaurants rose 3.5%. They jumped 4.5% at limited-service restaurants, which include fast food and fast casual joints. The increases, particularly in fast food prices, have caused customers to pull back on spending and complain online, eroding the sector\u2019s reputation for affordability. Restaurant chains raise menu prices every year, but since the pandemic hikes have been coming in fast and furious. Executives noted that for a while, the higher prices didn\u2019t scare people off. But customers finally snapped, leaving chains to reverse course and sometimes get defensive. McDonald\u2019s USA president Joe Erlinger recently said in an open letter that prices have risen about 21% over five years. That\u2019s a bit less than inflation overall \u2014 not 100% as, he said, people may think, thanks to an analysis from FinanceBuzz. It recently found that McDonald\u2019s prices have risen 100% since 2014. Still, he acknowledged that at some locations, Big Mac meals may be going for much higher. On TikTok, complaints of $3 McDonald\u2019s hash browns and $16 meals have gone viral. Chains from Burger King to KFC to Starbucks have also started touting menu bundles and deals in a bid to lure customers back. The deals, however, are temporary, designed to jumpstart sales in a competitive environment. They don\u2019t change restaurant chain operators\u2019 plans to keep raising prices. What\u2019s going on in the grocery store Grocery prices, on the other hand, have moderated, a welcome reversal from months of increases that started with the pandemic, and were exacerbated by the war in Ukraine, extreme weather\u00a0and companies taking the opportunity to pad prices, among other factors. In February,\u00a0overall food prices remained flat\u00a0for the first time since April 2023. Some items have even gotten cheaper over the course of the year. Apple prices plunged 13.2%, thanks largely to an abundant crop in the fall. Also in the produce aisle, potatoes declined 3.2%. Ham slumped 5.4% and cheese dropped 3.4% (bread rose 1%, so your sandwich isn\u2019t a total bargain). Coffee dropped 2.5% and milk fell 2.1%. Rice decreased 2%, and fish and seafood together dropped 1%. Other items got more expensive this year, particularly in the meat aisle, due in part to a\u00a0constrained supply of cattle\u00a0and\u00a0deadly wildfires in Texas. Uncooked beef roasts rose 6% and uncooked ground beef jumped 4.9%. Hot dogs spiked 7.3% and bacon went up 6.9%. Poultry rose 1.2%. Eggs, which last year notched huge increases, went up by 3%. While grocery prices increased overall for the year, they stayed flat from April to May. In that time, bacon jumped 1.7%, bread went up 1.1%, and uncooked ground beef and chicken each rose 1%. Other prices slumped: Milk dropped 1.3% and rice fell 1.2%.

Chinese state media Jiemian reported last week that local executives had been accused of embezzling \u201cmillions of euros\u201d in an unsigned letter written by whistleblowers calling themselves employees of Adidas China. The letter was widely publicized online.

Lange declined further comment pending the outcome of the inquiry. Shares of Adidas fell 3.7% on Monday. Jiemian wrote that the letter from whistleblowers had been sent directly to the company\u2019s German headquarters before being shared on social media. The reported complaint alleged that a senior executive in Greater China who manages Adidas\u2019 marketing budget had embezzled millions of euros and taken huge kickbacks from external advertising and celebrity agencies. Several members of the executive\u2019s team and other employees were also implicated, according to a copy of the letter published by the Chinese state media outlet. Adidas Greater China\u2019s overall promotional budget amounted to 250 million euros ($268 million) a year, including expenses dedicated to marketing, branding and trade fairs, Jiemian reported, citing the letter. The senior manager was also accused of \u201cnepotism\u201d and \u201cworkplace bullying,\u201d including isolating some employees and forcing them to leave, the whistleblowers\u2019 reportedly said. People who followed her instructions were promoted, they added. The complaint also alleged that one of the manager\u2019s subordinates had received \u201cmillions \u2026 from suppliers and physical items such as real estate.\u201d The whistleblowers vowed to disclose the matter to the media and law enforcement if the company did not address the allegations.

In mainland China, Adidas is the second largest international sportswear brand behind Nike (NKE). The German company has enjoyed a rebound in sales growth in China after Beijing scrapped Covid restrictions at the end of 2022. But its market share has declined significantly from pre-pandemic levels because of competition from local rivals and a controversy over its refusal to use Xinjiang cotton. In 2021, Adidas \u2014 along with H&M, Nike and other big Western apparel brands \u2014 faced a boycott in China because of the stand they had taken against the\u00a0alleged use of forced labor\u00a0to produce cotton in the country\u2019s western region of Xinjiang.

{"id": "2024_06_17_business_china-europe-pork-imports", "text": "Beijing has launched an investigation into prices of pork from the European Union, targeting a major EU food export just days after Brussels hiked tariffs on electric vehicles from China. The move risks escalating tension in one of the world\u2019s biggest trading relationships and will heighten fears among EU exporters that Beijing could go after their goods to retaliate against the provisional EV tariffs. China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce said Monday that local agricultural producers had requested an anti-dumping investigation into pork and pig by-products from the EU and that a preliminary inspection had found sufficient grounds for a formal probe into whether their prices are artificially low. It added that the investigation should conclude within a year but could be extended by six months if required. A hike in import tariffs could be very costly for European pork producers if it ends up hurting demand in China, the world\u2019s largest pork market and the main destination for EU pork exports. The EU is the second-biggest pork producer after China. According to EU customs data, the bloc exported more than \u20ac2.5 billion ($2.7 billion) worth of pork, including offal, to China last year. Almost half of that came from Spain, with the Netherlands, Denmark and France also exporting substantial amounts. Beijing has already launched an anti-dumping investigation into brandy imported from the EU and could impose tariffs that would hit French cognac makers. China could also target European wine and luxury goods, according to analysts at Rhodium Group, a think tank. Olof Gill, a spokesperson for the European Commission, the EU\u2019s executive arm, told reporters Monday at that the EU would follow the investigation into pork products \u201cvery closely\u201d and \u201cintervene as appropriate\u201d to ensure the probe complies with rules set by the World Trade Organization. Responding to a question about the EU\u2019s considerable agricultural subsidies, Gill added that the bloc was \u201cnot the least bit worried\u201d that the WTO could find in China\u2019s favor. \u201cAny subsidies\u2026 are strictly in line with our WTO obligations,\u201d he said. Beijing had been widely expected to use targeted measures to try to dissuade EU officials from permanently adopting higher tariffs on electric cars imported from China, a decision the EU must make by November. The provisional tariffs are due to take effect on July 4. The European Commission announced last week that additional\u00a0tariffs of between 17.4% and 38.1% would be applied to EVs manufactured in China on top of the existing EU duty of 10%. That takes the highest overall rate to close to 50%. Beijing immediately denounced the measure, which could hurt its ambitions to grow EV exports and is likely to hasten efforts by Chinese carmakers to set up factories in Europe. Brussels is also investigating China\u2019s state support for wind turbine companies and solar panel suppliers amid concerns that the country\u2019s industrial overcapacity is flooding markets elsewhere with cheap exports.

Since the majority of tax filers get a refund, there\u2019s a fair chance you could get hundreds if not thousands of dollars back in overpaid taxes, especially if you\u2019re also owed a refund from your state government. That money may feel like a windfall, and it\u2019s easy to squander it on a lot of little things. But if you\u2019re looking to improve your current financial situation, here are seven ideas to consider. Well, technically six, but you\u2019ll enjoy the seventh the most. 1. Pay off high-rate debt If you are carrying a balance on your credit card and are paying 20% to 30% in interest, make this your first priority to pay down. At such sky-high rates, \u201cthe debt can grow faster than you can pay it off,\u201d said Eric Bronnenkant, a certified financial planner and head of tax at Betterment, a robo-advisory financial services firm that also has a human advice team on hand to help clients. Keyana Russ, a certified financial planner at Four Ponds Financial Planning, concurred that people\u2019s awareness of how much money they\u2019re paying in interest over time doesn\u2019t always register. \u201cWhat I usually see is people paying the minimum, or they\u2019re charging everyday expenses and not paying off the bill at the end of the month. \u2026 They don\u2019t understand how much interest they\u2019re paying,\u201d Russ said. For example, if you\u2019re carrying a $3,000 balance at 27% interest and you only pay a required minimum of $97.50 every month, it will take you 240 months (which is 20 years) just to pay off the $3,000 \u2014 and, in addition, you will have paid $3,044.57 in interest, for a total of $6,044.57, according to Bankrate.com\u2019s calculator. 2. Create or add to an emergency fund You can use your refund to start or bolster an emergency fund. When it comes to costly emergencies, there are many Americans who don\u2019t have at least three months\u2019 worth of living expenses set aside, let alone enough to easily handle an unexpected bill of $1,000. Be sure to stash the money in a high-yield savings account at an FDIC-insured bank, Russ suggested, noting that the best interest rates are typically offered by online banks. If you have high-rate debt and you\u2019re lacking emergency savings, Russ suggested you might use a portion of your refund to attack your debt and the other portion to create an emergency fund. Bronnenkant favors paying off the high-rate debt first, but, if you\u2019re low on emergency savings and need a critical repair to help keep your job \u2014 such as on your car \u2014 he said it might make sense to set aside money for that repair and put the rest toward your credit card or other high-rate debt. 3. Make an extra payment on your mortgage If you\u2019re carrying a mortgage at a high rate (e.g., 7% to 8%), and you\u2019re not saddled with credit card debt, you might consider making an extra payment or two. \u201cIt can make a difference in the long run towards your principal,\u201d Russ said.\u00a0 You can even view it as an additional form of savings, in the sense that you\u2019re saving yourself an extra 7% \ufeffor so in interest on the portion of the principal you\u2019re paying down, Bronnenkant noted. 4. Invest in a Roth IRA If your income qualifies you to contribute to a Roth IRA, you can contribute up to $7,000 this year ($8,000 if you\u2019re at least 50) with after-tax savings. That money will grow untaxed until retirement, at which point your withdrawals will be tax-free and penalty-free after age 59-1/2, assuming the account has been open for at least five years. (And note: You can still make a 2023 Roth contribution until April 15 this year. The contribution limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if you\u2019re age 50 or older. Bolstering your tax-free retirement savings is great.\u00a0But if you need to access some of your money well before you retire, you may take out any part of your contributions tax-free and penalty-free at any time, \ufeffBronnenkant said. You would only be taxed and penalized if you withdrew the earnings on your contributions before age 59-1/2. (For more information on Roth IRA withdrawal rules, here is an easy-to-understand rundown from Charles Schwab.) 5. Contribute enough to your 401(k) in 2024 to get your full employer match Speaking of retirement savings, if you\u2019re not yet contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match from your employer, a refund can make that easier. Say you get $3,000 back. You can put that money in a high-yield savings account to earn interest. Then, on your workplace 401(k) site, change your paycheck contribution levels so that by the end of the year you will have contributed $3,000 more in pre-tax money than you otherwise would have. For instance, say you\u2019re paid every two weeks and you have 20 more paychecks left until the end of the year. You can boost you biweekly contributions by $150 per paycheck ($150 x 20 = $3,000). \u201cYou want to get the max match from your employer,\u201d Bronnenkant said. 6. Invest for shorter-term goals If in the next three to 10 years you expect to buy a home, take a once-in-a-lifetime trip, renovate a room, send your kids to summer camp or have any other expensive goal, you might consider investing your refund in a diversified mix of low-cost, broad market index funds. The shorter term your goal is, the less risk you want to take. If you need the money within three years, you might consider putting your refund in certificates of deposits and US Treasury bonds. But if your goal is five to 10 years out, and you\u2019re comfortable taking on some more risk and are willing to accept fluctuations in the market, Bronnenkant said, you might put no more than 30% of your refund in a stock index fund and 70% in a total market bond fund if your risk tolerance is conservative; or 50% in each if you have a moderate risk tolerance. If you plan on sending your child to college and you have a 529 plan, you can use your refund to boost your contributions to that plan, Russ said. You may also get a tax break for your contribution depending on the state where you live. 7. Have some fun Unless you\u2019re in truly dire financial straits, if you get a large refund, you might set aside a small portion to do whatever you truly enjoy. \u201cSometimes you just want to have fun and not have it be all business,\u201d Russ said. \u201cYou can set aside some of the money to have fun.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/15/success/best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "business"}}

With clients working with a single channel of communication that directs\u00a0Samsung\u2019s memory chip, foundry and chip packaging teams at once, the time it takes to produce AI chips, usually weeks, has been cut by around 20%,\u00a0Samsung\u00a0said on Wednesday. \u201cWe are truly living in the age of AI, the emergence of generative AI is completely changing the technology landscape,\u201d said Siyoung Choi, president and general manager of the foundry business, at a\u00a0Samsung\u00a0event in San Jose, California. Samsung\u00a0expects global chip industry revenue to grow to $778 billion by 2028, boosted by AI chips, Choi said. At a briefing with reporters ahead of the event, Executive Vice President of Foundry Sales and Marketing Marco Chisari said the company believes OpenAI CEO Sam Altman\u2019s loose projections on soaring demand for AI chips are realistic. Altman has told executives at contract chipmaker TSMC that\u00a0he wanted to build roughly three dozen new chip factories, Reuters\u00a0has previously reported. Samsung\u00a0is one of the few companies that sells memory chips, offers foundry services and designs chips under the same roof. That combination has often worked against it in the past, as some clients were nervous that doing business with its foundry might benefit\u00a0Samsung\u00a0as a competitor in another field. However, with skyrocketing demand for AI chips and the need for all the chip parts to be highly integrated to train or infer huge amounts of data fast by using less power,\u00a0Samsung\u00a0believes its turnkey approach will be a strength going forward. The South Korean tech giant also touted its cutting-edge chip architecture known as gate all-around (GAA), a type of transistor architecture that helps improve chip performance and reduces power consumption. GAA is seen as important to keep making more powerful chips for AI as chips become finer to the point of pushing the boundaries of physics. Although competitors such as global foundry No 1 TSMC are also working on chips using GAA,\u00a0Samsung\u00a0started applying GAA earlier, and said it plans to mass produce its second-generation 3-nanometer chips using GAA in the second half of this year. Samsung\u00a0also announced its latest 2-nanometer chipmaking process for high-performance computing chips, which places power rails on the backside of the wafer to improve power delivery. Mass production is slated for 2027.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/tech/south-korea-samsung-ai-chips-plan-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "business"}}

America\u2019s top central banker recently said the job market now looks the way it did before the Covid-19 pandemic drastically upended society. But that assertion may not be exactly right, according to ZipRecruiter\u2019s chief economist. \u201cOverall, a broad set of indicators suggests that conditions in the labor market have returned to about where they stood on the eve of the pandemic, relatively tight but not overheated,\u201d Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said in a news conference Wednesday after the central bank signaled that it plans to cut interest rates just once this year. The Fed chief said that the job market has come into \u201ca better balance\u201d over the past few years as the central bank aggressively lifted rates from near-zero starting in March 2022, which does coincide with what official government statistics show. The ratio of job openings to the number of unemployed job seekers, a measure Powell frequently cites to illustrate the job market\u2019s tightness, is now 1.2 to one, down from 2 to 1 in the spring of 2022. Worker filings for unemployment benefits fell to a 53-year low in 2022, reflecting an usually tight job market, but claims have trended upward since and are now roughly back to levels seen in the five years before the pandemic. The rate at which Americans are quitting their jobs is also back to pre-pandemic levels. It\u2019s true that today\u2019s US job market is running at a slower pace than it did in the immediate aftermath of the pandemic, when the economy staged a stunning comeback from the brief recession in 2020. Powell said it\u2019s just a matter of a continued \u201cunwinding of the pandemic-related distortions to both supply and demand.\u201d However, the 2024 job market differs from 2019 in a few key ways. And those factors may not change anytime soon. Before the Bell spoke with Julia Pollak, chief economist at jobs site ZipRecruiter, about her views of the job market. (This interview has been edited for length and clarity.) Before the Bell: Do you agree with Chair Powell\u2019s view that today\u2019s job market is back to a pre-pandemic normal? Julia Pollak: No, I would say that this is not quite the same normal. It\u2019s a new normal, and there are some key differences. We\u2019re still adding employees faster than 2019. But under the surface, the labor market is different in that it\u2019s slower, so the amount of churn, dynamism, hiring, firing, everything is slower. Companies are slower to fire, they\u2019re also slower to hire, and workers are slower to switch jobs. Now, is that necessarily a bad thing? It\u2019s not clear. Why is the job market slower now? High interest rates [currently at a 23-year high] are holding back investments and causing businesses to sort of take a wait-and-see approach that is disincentivizing risk taking. They\u2019re not hiring new grads at the same rate, they seem quite reluctant to do so. It\u2019s a slower, stay-in-place economy, partly because of risk aversion in the face of high interest rates. The quit rate being lower also suggests that there are fewer better alternatives for people than their current jobs. People are eager to hang on to their job that gives them flexibility. I think companies did a lot of soul searching during and after the pandemic amid labor shortages to meaningfully improve compensation, benefits and working conditions, and that also may have reduced attrition. Unlike in 2019, there is more remote work and more flexible work. Remote and hybrid work are like five times bigger than they were before the pandemic. That\u2019s here to stay. But what about this persistently wide gap between job openings and the number of unemployed folks seeking work? I think there\u2019s reason to believe the labor market is actually less tight now than it was in 2019. The number of job openings is higher than it was by around 15% or so, but online job postings are actually lower by ZipRecruiter\u2019s count. You see this sort of gap widening between openings and hires and quits and everything else within [the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey]. It seems like we are systematically over-counting openings by more and more each year for some reason. Markets fear the French far right could trigger a financial crisis Investors are worried France could be facing a financial crisis if the political center collapses in upcoming parliamentary elections, leaving far-right populists in charge of the European Union\u2019s second-biggest economy, my colleague Olesya Dmitracova reports. President Emmanuel Macron called the snap elections a week ago after his party lost to the\u00a0far right in a vote for EU lawmakers, a shock move that\u00a0rattled\u00a0markets for French stocks and government bonds. There has been widespread speculation since then that the National Rally, the party of far-right doyenne Marine Le Pen, is poised to become the most powerful force in parliament, unseating Macron\u2019s centrist bloc. Such an outcome could make it harder to reduce France\u2019s huge government debt pile, equal to 110.6% of gross domestic product at the end of last year, and could even add to it. A bitterly divided parliament would also struggle to cut the budget deficit \u2014 the gap between government spending and tax receipts \u2014 which\u00a0reached 5.5%\u00a0of GDP last year.

{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_ftc-tiktok-probe-privacy-and-security", "text": "The Federal Trade Commission is investigating TikTok for its data and security practices, two sources told CNN on the condition of anonymity. The probe is yet another complication for the social media platform, which is already facing the threat of a potential US ban or a forced divestment from its Chinese parent company. The sources said that the FTC is probing TikTok over an alleged violation of the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection rule, which requires companies to notify parents and obtain consent before collecting data from children under 13. The agency is also investigating whether TikTok violated a portion of the FTC Act that prohibits \u201cunfair or deceptive\u201d business practices, the sources said, in denying that TikTok user data could be accessed by individuals in China. The FTC could bring a suit against TikTok or settle with the company in the coming weeks, according to one of the sources. Politico reported news of the probe earlier. When asked about the investigation, FTC Director of Public Affairs Douglas Farrar replied: \u201cNo comment.\u201d TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The FTC probe comes as TikTok faces an existential threat in the US. Earlier this month, a bipartisan group in the US House of Representatives voted to pass a law forcing TikTok to be sold by ByteDance or face a ban from US app stores. The bill is now before the Senate, and President Joe Biden has said he would sign it if it gets to his desk. Senate leaders, however, have indicated they are taking a deliberate approach \u2014\u00a0which could lead to delays or even potentially doom the House bill. The short-form video company, owned by Chinese firm ByteDance, has denied assertions that its app poses a national security threat to US citizens. TikTok, which does not operate in China, has said that the Chinese government has never accessed US user data. Cybersecurity experts say Chinese laws require ByteDance to cooperate with that country\u2019s intelligence demands\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a fact that, given ByteDance\u2019s ownership of TikTok, could hypothetically put US user data at risk. To address that issue, TikTok has taken steps to store its US user data on cloud servers controlled by US tech giant Oracle and established internal protocols limiting access by non-US employees. TikTok acknowledged to Congress in 2022 that employees based in China could access US user data, following a report that year by BuzzFeed News that ByteDance employees had accessed that information on multiple occasions. TikTok CEO Shou Chew, in his first appearance before Congress last year, also acknowledged that several ByteDance employees were fired for spying on certain US journalists as part of a \u201cmisguided attempt\u201d to hunt down leakers within the company.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/ftc-tiktok-probe-privacy-and-security/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_media_infowars-alex-jones-liquidation-ruling", "text": "A Texas bankruptcy judge\u00a0has\u00a0rejected a proposed liquidation of\u00a0conspiracy theorist\u00a0Alex Jones\u2019\u00a0company\u00a0Free Speech Systems, the parent company of Infowars, saying that a denial of the bankruptcy plan was, in his opinion, in the best interest of the creditors. But the judge approved a separate liquidation of Jones\u2019 personal assets. Judge Chris Lopez said the Infowars bankruptcy process had dragged on and that it needed to stop \u201cincurring costs\u201d and let the families of Sandy Hook victims try to claim what they are owed through state courts. The families have not received payment of the approximately $1.5 billion in damages against Jones that they have won after he lied about the 2012 school massacre. \u201cThe right call is to dismiss this case,\u201d\u00a0Lopez said Friday. Lopez made his ruling in a\u00a0lengthy\u00a0decision\u00a0where he seemed emotional at times, once even noting the timing of this decision being made shortly before Father\u2019s Day. \u201cI think it needed to happen,\u201d he said towards the end of the hearing. \u201cI wish I would\u2019ve picked a better day.\u201d Unanswered questions The rejection of the bankruptcy plan leaves many questions to sort out in the decision\u2019s wake. Among them: What happens next for Infowars? And what legal avenues remain for the victims\u2019 families to collect the massive sum Jones still owes them? This judgment could be viewed as a partial victory for Jones, who fought the liquidation proposal \u2013 but so too did some families, whose attorneys said they\u2019ll benefit more from the bankruptcy plan\u2019s dismissal by going after Jones\u2019 assets immediately \u2013 rather than waiting for a prolonged bankruptcy procedure to play out. That ruling leaves Free Speech Systems to face its creditors outside of bankruptcy in state courts, noted Marie Reilly, professor of bankruptcy law at Penn State University. In a statement, an attorney for the families said they would press on. \u201cToday is a good day. Alex Jones has lost ownership of Infowars, the corrupt business he has used for years to attack the Connecticut families and so many others,\u201d said Chris Mattei, an attorney for the families. \u201cThe Court authorized us to move immediately to collect against all Infowars assets, and we intend to do exactly that.\u201d Lopez noted that the case is far from over. The interim trustee, and later the permanent trustee\ufeff, in Jones\u2019 personal case will ultimately decided Infowars\u2019 fate. \u201cThose trustees will make decisions about where things go,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not leaving thing\ufeffs into the wind here.\u201d Jay Westbrook, a University of Texas bankruptcy law professor, said that Infowars could still be sold by the court-appointed trustee to pay some of the damages owed to the families, but it would likely not fetch a high price. \u201cJones owns [Free Speech Systems] and thus his bankruptcy trustee could sell it, but without his active promotion it may be of little value, except for its inventory of products he has been selling,\u201d Westbrook said. Jones\u00a0had been\u00a0opposed to liquidating\u00a0Infowars and in recent days ranted on his show about what could be its impending shutdown, urging his audience to buy his products to support him. \u201cI\u2019m going to try to move forward and maximize the amount of money we can make at Info\ufeffwars to then have a wind-down,\u201d Jones said outside the court house after the hearing Friday. Jones\u2019 attorney, Vickie Driver, applauded the decision, saying the judge was fair in his review of the unique aspects of the case. \u201cMr. Jones did everything he could to preserve as much value as he could in Free Speech Systems to pay the plaintiffs,\u201d Driver said. Westbrook said if Jones continues at Infowars, it could maximize the amount of money the victims families could draw from it. \u201cThe problem is that Jones\u2019 appeal to his audience, awful as it is to say it, is probably the only thing of value he has that is not exempt in Texas and it is very difficult to make him use it to benefit anyone else,\u201d Westbrook said. Jones\u2019 personal bankruptcy approved Earlier on Friday, Lopez approved the liquidation of\u00a0Jones\u2019 personal assets after the conspiracy theorist agreed to convert\u00a0his personal bankruptcy into a Chapter 7 liquidation last week. The liquidation means that Jones will immediately lose control of his property except for certain exempt property, such as a $2 million house in Austin. Jones\u2019 decision to seek bankruptcy protection comes after he agreed to demands from the families of Sandy Hook victims. The judge said an interim trustee will be appointed to oversee Jones\u2019 estate, as is standard in these cases. Jones\u2019 attorney Vickie Driver told the court $2.8 million from the sale of Jones\u2019 ranch could be sent to the trustee. Jones founded Infowars, an influential conspiracy empire, in the late 1990s. Over the years, Jones has used the media company to poison the public discourse with lies and conspiracy theories, and he also enriched himself, making millions of dollars in the process. Whatever proceeds are gained from Jones\u2019 personal bankruptcy will amount to just a fraction of what he owes families of Sandy Hook victims. The families argued to the court that there is \u201cno prospect\u201d the Jones\u2019 company could produce a proper reorganization plan under a Chapter 11 bankruptcy, which would allow the company to remain operational through its restructuring. The judge\u2019s rulings on Friday would not prevent Jones from spreading conspiracy theories and lies online. X CEO Elon Musk restored Jones\u2019 social media account in December 2023 after a five-year ban from the platform. And Jones could go on any number of far-right outlets to share his outlandish views. But the Sandy Hook families are hoping\u00a0to seize Jones\u2019 social media accounts, arguing they are a key part of his Infowars business that allow Jones to promote his brand. And Jones may not be welcome at some venues: He had been listed as a guest on the Milwaukee stop on Tucker Carlson\u2019s live tour but was recently dropped from the lineup without explanation. Lies and conspiracy theories Since founding Infowars in the late 1990s, Jones has pushed several conspiracy theories, including the lie that the 2012 Newtown, Connecticut, mass school shooting was a so-called \u201cfalse flag\u201d operation staged by the government and that the grieving family members of 20 child victims were \u201cactors.\u201d\u00a0Jones makes money on those conspiracy theories by hawking high-priced dietary supplements to his audience. The mood Friday on Jones\u2019 Infowars was somber, with the far-right outlet\u2019s hosts speculating on its future. Chase Geiser, an Infowars host who had driven with Jones to the courthouse where the bankruptcy hearing was underway, made a brief appearance on the outlet, attempting to twist the judge\u2019s decision as one that would net Jones an even larger audience. Jones\u2019 regularly scheduled program was replaced with previously recorded interviews, airing conversations with Tucker Carlson and Russell Brand.
