{"id": "2024_05_04_economy_what-exactly-goes-into-closing-costs", "text": "Elevated interest rates and pricier listings have made it even harder to afford a new home. But there is an often-overlooked expense when buying a home: closing costs. These costs, which are the fees owed on the day you finalize the purchase of a home, have risen in recent years. In 2022, the median cost of a loan paid by homebuyers \u2014 including origination fees, appraisal and credit report fees, title insurance, discount points and other fees \u2014 was $6,000, a nearly 22% increase from 2021, according to a report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. But the calculation for closing costs could soon change. The Biden administration plans to take aim at so-called \u201cjunk fees\u201d hidden in closing costs: In a recent report, the CFPB said it would work to \u201canalyze mortgage closing costs, seek public input and, as necessary, issue rules and guidance to improve competition, choice, and affordability.\u201d And this month it launched a public inquiry into the issue. Additionally, a recent settlement by the National Association of Realtors set to take effect in August could potentially increase these costs for some homebuyers. Here\u2019s what to know about closing costs: What are you paying for? Not every buyer pays the same amount in closing costs. The final bill depends on several factors, including which state you live in, taxes, the type of mortgage loan you take out and the overall cost of the home you are buying. Closing costs can include an application fee to process your loan request, home appraisal fees that determine how much the property is worth, a credit reporting fee, title insurance (which protects the buyer from defective property titles) and an origination fee (the price you pay for getting the loan in the first place). Some states require an attorney at closing, which adds to the overall bill. Some lenders roll closing costs into the total mortgage, increasing payments over time. New York, Delaware and Washington, DC, have the highest average closing costs, according to Bankrate; while Missouri, Indiana and North Dakota have the lowest. \u201cThey typically can be 3% to 4% of the amount of the loan,\u201d Jeff Ostrowski, \ufeffwho covers housing at Bankrate, said of closing costs nationwide. \u201cSo if you\u2019re borrowing $400,000, you\u2019re talking about an extra $12,000 to $15,000.\u201d Ostrowski said that while existing homebuyers already know the drill when it comes to closing costs, some first-time homebuyers may forget to factor them in when saving for a home. \u201cFor first-time buyers who are really stretching to qualify, it can be something to worry about,\u201d Ostrowski said. \u201cGenerally, the loan officer you\u2019re working with knows that and they\u2019re going to factor that in to your approval process.\u201d Realtor settlement could add to homebuyers\u2019 costs Historically, homebuyers haven\u2019t had to pay their realtors\u2019 fees themselves. However, last month, a federal judge gave the green light to the NAR settlement, paving the way for potential changes to the current real estate business model. Under the terms of the settlement, sellers\u2019 agents will no longer be required to offer commissions to buyers\u2019 agents. This means homebuyers may have to pay their Realtor\u2019s commission themselves, adding to the overall cost at closing. Brian Connolly, an assistant professor of business law at the University of Michigan, said it\u2019s too soon to predict how the NAR settlement may affect closing costs. \u201cIt\u2019s not really all that clear what\u2019s going to happen with broker commissions after the NAR settlement goes into effect this summer,\u201d Connolly said, predicting the status quo may remain even after the settlement takes effect. \u201cAt least initially, we\u2019re likely to see the percentage commission system continue.\u201d No more junk fees? As part of the broader Biden administration effort to crack down on junk fees, the CFPB said it was looking into ways to reduce costs for homebuyers. Closing costs are \u201ctoo often full of junk fees,\u201d the bureau said. Fees for credit reports were one example given by the CFPB. Homebuyers pay a fee for mortgage lenders to pull their credit reports from the three major credit reporting companies: Equifax, TransUnion and Experian. Those costs have recently spiked by 25% or as much as 400%, according to the CFPB. (Consumers can check their credit scores for free every 12 months at AnnualCreditReport.com). \u201cThese steep increases in a market that lacks competition and choice warrant further scrutiny,\u201d the report said. While it\u2019s a good start, tackling junk fees doesn\u2019t get to the heart of the home affordability crisis, Connolly said. \u201cThe fact that we\u2019re heavily under-supplied on housing, we\u2019re dealing with labor shortages in home construction and we\u2019re dealing with continued high prices for raw materials \u2014 these are the bigger structure issues in the market and it seems like this is just working around the edges for a much bigger issue,\u201d he said. Lowering closing costs on your own There is one relatively simple way to lower your overall closing costs: shop around. According to Freddie Mac, a significant percentage of people don\u2019t compare rates from multiple lenders, though it could save homebuyers thousands of dollars. For example, in late 2022, borrowers could save as much as $600 annually by getting one additional rate quote and an average of more than $1,200 annually by getting at least four rate quotes, according to data compiled by Freddie Mac. \u201cBorrowers who received as many as five rate quotes during the second half of 2022 could have potentially saved more than $6,000 over the life of the loan, assuming the loan remains active for at least five years,\u201d Genaro Villa, an economist at Freddie Mac, said in a statement. And even if more than one lender pulls your credit score, it won\u2019t hurt your credit, as long as it\u2019s done within a 45-day window, according to the CFPB. \u201cYou should get at least three mortgage offers,\u201d Ostrowski said. \u201cWhen you compare those offers, examine not just the rate itself but also the closing costs. There can be some variation, and if it\u2019s significant, you obviously would want to choose the lender that gives you the best deal.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments and context.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/04/economy/what-exactly-goes-into-closing-costs/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_29_business_american-airlines-alleged-discrimination-black-male-passengers", "text": "A lawsuit filed Wednesday on behalf of three Black men alleges \u201cblatant and egregious race discrimination\u201d by American Airlines when they were removed from a flight. The suit alleges that the plaintiffs \u2013 Alvin Jackson, Emmanuel Jean Joseph and Xavier Veal \u2013 and five other Black male passengers were ejected from American Flight 832 from Phoenix to JFK in New York City on January 5, 2024, \u201cwithout any valid reason, based solely on their race,\u201d according to the complaint. An American Airlines representative approached each of the men before takeoff, the complaint said, ordering them off the plane. The passengers complied. \u201c(O)nce they reached the jet bridge, they saw that several other Black men were also being removed from the plane. In fact, it appeared to Plaintiffs that American had ordered all of the Black male passengers on Flight 832 off the plane,\u201d the complaint reads. American representatives told the men a complaint about body odor had prompted their removal, according to the suit. None of the plaintiffs were told that they personally had body odor, \u201cand in fact none of the Plaintiffs had offensive body odor,\u201d it says. At least one American representative agreed with the plaintiffs when they suggested that they had been singled out because they were Black, the suit alleges. Cell phone footage taken by some of the men and shared by the Public Citizen Litigation Group representing the plaintiffs shows a chaotic scene as they question the airline\u2019s actions and records one man saying, \u201cSo this is discrimination.\u201d \u201cI agree, I agree,\u201d says a woman wearing a badge who appears to be an airline employee. \u201cWe\u2019re the only ones getting taken off the plane,\u201d says one man, panning across the group. \u201cLook at us.\u201d In another video, a man comments, \u201cThis is crazy. Y\u2019all just took like eight Black people off the plane.\u201d The plaintiffs did not know each other before the flight and were not seated together, according to the complaint. At the gate, the men were told that a White male flight attendant had made the body odor complaint, the suit says. The men were eventually allowed back on after about an hour after the airline determined there were no available flights that evening. \u201cPlaintiffs then had to reboard the plane and endure the stares of the largely white passengers who viewed them as the cause of the substantial delay. They suffered during the entire flight home, and the entire incident was traumatic, upsetting, scary, humiliating, and degrading,\u201d the complaint reads. \u201cWe take all claims of discrimination very seriously and want our customers to have a positive experience when they choose to fly with us,\u201d American Airlines said in a statement. \u201cOur teams are currently investigating the matter, as the claims do not reflect our core values or our purpose of caring for people.\u201d The plaintiffs are seeking \u201cdeclaratory relief, just compensation for their pain and suffering, a punitive damage award sufficient to deter American from discriminating against Black passengers in the future,\u201d as well as attorneys fees. The complaint also refers to what it calls \u201cAmerican\u2019s pattern of discriminating against Black passengers,\u201d which prompted an NAACP warning in 2017 related to the airline. That warning was lifted nine months later after the airline made progress in addressing the organization\u2019s concerns.

Following a four-month long disappearance, Subway announced Wednesday the \u201ctriumphant return\u201d of the oversized chocolate chip cookie, which was pulled from many restaurants less than two weeks after its January debut because of massive demand.

{"id": "2024_05_30_business_zero-down-mortgages-making-a-comeback", "text": "Many Americans would love to buy a home, but they don\u2019t have tens of thousands of dollars to cover a down payment. That massive roadblock is being removed by a\u00a0new zero-percent down mortgage program\u00a0launched two weeks ago by one of the nation\u2019s largest mortgage lenders. However, the new program, offered by United Wholesale Mortgage, is making some experts nervous about how these loans could backfire on homeowners \u2014 especially if home prices stop going to the moon. And for some, it\u2019s bringing back bad memories of the\u00a0subprime mortgage meltdown\u00a0that fueled the 2008 financial crisis. UWM, led by\u00a0Mat Ishbia, the billionaire owner of the Phoenix Suns NBA team, said homebuyers who qualify won\u2019t need to put down an upfront down payment. Instead, the program will allow buyers to pay for 97% of the home\u2019s value with a first mortgage and then provide the remaining 3% (up to $15,000) in the form of a second mortgage. That second mortgage won\u2019t accrue interest, but it will need to be paid back \u2014 in full as a balloon payment \u2014 when the home is sold, the mortgage is paid off or if the owner refinances. \u2018Demand has been huge\u2019 These mortgages are only open to first-time homebuyers and those making no more than 80% of the area\u2019s median income. \u201cThe initial demand has been huge. We already have a couple of thousands of loans submitted,\u201d Alex Elezaj, UWM\u2019s chief strategy officer, told CNN. UWM said that no other wholesale lender or non-bank mortgage company is offering such a program nationally. (UWM is a wholesale lender that connects homebuyers and realtors with mortgage brokers through its Mortgage Matchup platform. Earlier this month, Mortgage Matchup was named the\u00a0first-ever mortgage partner\u00a0of the NBA and WNBA.) Yet some worry that this kind of mortgage could cause problems for homeowners down the line. The central risk is that because they put down no down payment up front, homeowners will be starting with no equity. That means they\u2019d find themselves instantly underwater (owing more than the home is worth) if the red-hot housing market suddenly cools and home values go down. \u201cIt could happen again\u201d That could be a problem if the homeowner needs to sell quickly, perhaps because they lose their job, face financial distress or need to relocate. Suddenly, they\u2019d be on the hook to pay back that second mortgage. And because they\u2019re underwater, the home sale won\u2019t generate enough cash to retire the debt. \u201cIf the homeowner lacks the cash to make up the difference, then he or she will be in default on the second mortgage and at risk of foreclosure and damaged credit,\u201d said Patricia McCoy, a professor at Boston College Law School. That scenario is \u201cexactly what happened during the subprime crisis, when millions of homeowners were underwater on their mortgage and went into default,\u201d said McCoy, a former mortgage regulator at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). \u201cIt happened before and it could happen again.\u201d The housing bubble that popped around 2006 was fueled in part by an explosion of lending to subprime borrowers. In the years leading up to the bubble, lenders came up with new products like adjustable rate mortgages and no down-payment loans that ended up blowing up when home prices eventually collapsed. Locked into high rates? To be sure, right now the housing market is on fire. Home prices are at record highs and demand is so strong that some homes are selling above asking price after all-cash bidding wars. Still, another potential issue is that homeowners could find themselves locked into high-interest mortgage rates if the Federal Reserve starts cutting interest rates. That\u2019s because in order to refinance at a lower rate, the homeowner would need to fully pay off that second mortgage. And they may not have enough cash to do that. They could also be stuck with higher rates because the lenders won\u2019t let the borrower refinance if they haven\u2019t built up enough equity in the home. There are other options for zero-down mortgages. For instance, Bank of America launched a\u00a0zero-down payment mortgage program\u00a0in 2022 for first-time homebuyers in certain Black and Hispanic neighborhoods. As\u00a0Bankrate\u00a0notes, there are also zero-down home loans backed by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) in rural areas as well as loans for veterans and surviving spouses guaranteed by the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). \u2018Read the fine print\u2019 Anneliese Lederer, senior policy counsel at the Center for Responsible Lending, said it\u2019s crucial for homeowners considering the UWM loan program to be educated about the terms and conditions. \u201cUsing fun lines like \u2018no-down payment\u2019 sounds exciting and great. But you need to read the fine print,\u201d Lederer said. \u201cThis could be a fantastic product to allow people who can afford the mortgage payment but don\u2019t have the down payment to access homeownership. But the question is: How do you pay off that second mortgage? What is the plan? Right now there is no plan.\u201d Dennis Kelleher, CEO of Better Markets, a nonprofit that advocates for tougher financial regulation, told CNN he worries that a mortgage product like this will hurt some borrowers if the housing market stumbles. \u201cThese mortgages are going to be ticking time bombs \u2013 just like subprime mortgages \u2013unless home prices continue to increase very substantially,\u201d Kelleher said. \u201cThis has the potential to turn the American dream of homeownership almost immediately into a nightmare.\u201d Kelleher noted that although home prices are rising sharply now, there is no guarantee that will continue. Existing home prices jumped by\u00a0another 6% last month year-over-year to $407,600\u00a0\u2014 the highest median price in April on record. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if we are in a bubble that is going to burst or if the trend lines are going to increase,\u201d Kelleher said. \u201cBut pushing 100% mortgage products on low-income people when housing prices are at historic highs should cause everybody to be very concerned.\u201d Lessons of the subprime crisis Jonathan Adams, an assistant professor at Saint Joseph\u2019s University teaching real estate finance, said the UWM loan program has \u201call the features that made subprime bad.\u201d UWM pushed back on these concerns, noting that borrowers must still go through strict underwriting guidelines. \u201cPeople who make these claims are uneducated about the current state of the industry,\u201d said Elezaj, the UWM executive. \u201cIn today\u2019s environment, UWM is responsible for underwriting the loan, which gives us confidence that these are high quality loans.\u201d \u201cThis is a huge positive. It\u2019s helping consumers and is a great win across the board,\u201d Elezaj said. \u201cThink about all the people who are renting and would love to buy a house, but they face this roadblock of coming up with $10,000 or $15,000 for a down payment. This eliminates that.\u201d It\u2019s also worth noting that some experts say lending standards have been improved significantly since the 2008 financial crisis. The days of\u00a0NINJA loans\u00a0(no-income, no job, no assets) and adjustable-rate mortgages are largely gone. \u201cWe\u2019re not going back to 2006 here,\u201d said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate. \u201cLending standards are light years removed from pre-crisis when there oftentimes weren\u2019t any standards at all.\u201d Yet Adams, a former Wall Street analyst, cautioned that someone who can\u2019t make a down payment and makes less than 80% of the median income (those that qualify for this loan program) is likely to suffer more in an economy when home prices are falling. \u201cOne of the lessons of the subprime crisis,\u201d Adams said, \u201cwas that you are\u00a0not\u00a0doing any favors to borrowers by making it too easy to borrow.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/business/zero-down-mortgages-making-a-comeback/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk", "text": "In a year of wild tech stories that has seen Elon Musk transform Twitter, cryptocurrency exchange FTX collapse and Silicon Valley Bank implode, this week\u2019s whiplash-inducing turmoil at OpenAI is among the most captivating. Sam Altman \u2014 the leader of one of the world\u2019s most influential AI companies, OpenAI, and perhaps the\u00a0most visible figure in the fledgling industry \u2014 was fired Friday night by the startup\u2019s directors in a surprise move. Less than five days later, he\u2019s back as the company\u2019s CEO, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. The series of extraordinary events unfolded just days after OpenAI held its\u00a0first-ever developer conference, where it laid out new, commercialized versions of its technology, including the option to customize its ChatGPT AI chatbot. If you\u2019re just catching up, here\u2019s what you missed from a week so incredible you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking the script could have been written by an early version of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Friday Around 3 p.m. ET, Altman joined a Google Meet call with most of OpenAI\u2019s board that had been convened by fellow co-founder and OpenAI chief scientist\u00a0Ilya Sutskever, during which Altman was fired and told that the news would soon be made public. Within the next half hour, the board also informed Greg Brockman, another co-founder and OpenAI president, that he would be removed from the board. Around 3:30 p.m. ET, OpenAI publicly announced that it had fired Altman over concerns that he was not always truthful with the board. The board said Mira Murati, the company\u2019s chief technology officer, would become interim CEO. OpenAI\u2019s strategic partners, including its biggest financial backer Microsoft, were also reportedly informed of Altman\u2019s ouster just minutes before the board\u2019s announcement. Hours after being fired, Altman posted on X that he \u201cloved working with such talented people\u201d and that he would have \u201cmore to say about what\u2019s next later.\u201d Brockman promptly quit. \u201cPlease don\u2019t spend any time being concerned. We will be fine,\u201d Brockman\u00a0said in a Friday post\u00a0on X. \u201cGreater things coming soon.\u201d A key factor in the CEO\u2019s firing was\u00a0tension between Altman, who favored developing AI\u00a0more aggressively, and members of the OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the unfolding events. Saturday Within 24 hours of Altman being fired, reports emerged that he and other ex-OpenAI loyalists were mulling plans for their own venture. OpenAI\u2019s board was also reportedly having second thoughts and considering asking the ousted CEO to return. Sunday By Sunday afternoon, Altman was\u00a0back at OpenAI\u2019s headquarters\u00a0\u2014 this time with a guest badge \u2014 to negotiate his potential return. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reportedly mediated the discussion. A 5 p.m. PT deadline was reportedly set for the board to agree to Altman\u2019s demands, including adding a seat for Microsoft, and reinstating him as CEO. But those talks broke down. As Sunday turned into Monday, Nadella tweeted that Altman, along with Brockman, would join Microsoft to run a new AI research group. At OpenAI, the group found a new interim CEO: Emmett Shear, the former CEO of Amazon\u2019s streaming service, Twitch. Murati would return to her role as OpenAI\u2019s chief technology officer. Monday In a post on X early Monday, Shear, who left his role at Twitch in March, described the chance to join OpenAI as \u201ca once-in-a-lifetime\u201d opportunity. He added that the company would hire an independent investigator to report on what happened in the lead-up to Altman\u2019s firing. But OpenAI employees were not convinced. More than 500 staffers signed an open letter calling on the company\u2019s board to resign and reinstate Altman and Brockman. They also threatened to follow the co-founders to Microsoft if their demands were not met. Altman posted on X, saying, \u201cwe have more unity and commitment and focus than ever before. we are all going to work together some way or other, and i\u2019m so excited. one team, one mission.\u201d The drama was far from over.\u00a0The Verge reported Monday afternoon\u00a0that Altman and Brockman could still return to OpenAI if the board members who fired him resign. And Nadella, speaking to CNBC, said he was \u201copen to both options\u201d when asked whether Altman would actually join Microsoft. \u201cLook, that is for the OpenAI board and management and the employees to choose,\u201d Nadella said. \u201cWe chose to explicitly partner with OpenAI and we want to continue to do so, and obviously, that depends on the people of OpenAI staying there or coming to Microsoft.\u201d Tuesday Altman\u00a0was reinstated late Tuesday as OpenAI\u2019s CEO, the company said on X. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman\u00a0wrote\u00a0that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his\u00a0post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it has backed with billions to bolster its ambitions in developing AI. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Nadella\u00a0said\u00a0on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "business"}}

Hoodline,\u00a0founded in 2014 as a San Francisco-based hyper-local news outlet\u00a0with a mission\u00a0\u201cto cover the\u00a0news deserts\u00a0that no one else is covering,\u201d\u00a0once employed a newsroom full of\u00a0human journalists.\u00a0The outlet has since expanded into a national network of local websites, covering news and events in major cities across the country and drawing millions of readers each month, the company said. But last year, Hoodline began filling its site with AI-generated articles. A disclaimer page linked at the bottom of its pages notes to readers,\u00a0\u201cWhile AI may assist in the background, the essence of our journalism \u2014 from conception to publication \u2014 is driven by real human insight and discretion.\u201d Zachary Chen,\u00a0chief executive of\u00a0Hoodline parent company Impress3, which\u00a0acquired the site in 2020, defended the\u00a0site\u2019s\u00a0use of AI and its\u00a0transparency with readers, telling CNN the\u00a0outlet\u00a0provides valuable reporting in\u00a0news deserts\u00a0around the country\u00a0and is generating revenue to hire more\u00a0human\u00a0journalists\u00a0in the future. Hoodline\u2019s staff includes \u201cdozens of editors, as well as dozens of journalist researchers, full time,\u201d Chen said. The outlet also employs a \u201cgrowing number of on-the-ground journalists who research and write original stories about their neighborhood beats,\u201d\u00a0he added, referencing\u00a0recent articles about restaurants,\u00a0retail\u00a0stores and events\u00a0in the\u00a0San Francisco\u00a0area. Bios for bots But until recently, the site had further blurred the line between reality and illusion. Screenshots captured last year by\u00a0the Internet Archive and local outlet Gazetteer\u00a0showed Hoodline had\u00a0further embellished its AI author bylines with\u00a0what appeared to be AI-generated headshots resembling real people and fake biographical information. \u201cNina is a long-time writer and a Bay Area Native who writes about good food & delicious drink, tantalizing tech & bustling business,\u201d one biography claimed. The\u00a0fake headshots and biographies\u00a0have since\u00a0been removed from\u00a0site,\u00a0replaced with a small \u201cAI\u201d badge next to\u00a0each\u00a0machine-assisted\u00a0article\u2019s byline, though they still carry\u00a0human\u00a0names. The archived screenshots have also been wiped from much of the internet. Wayback Machine director Mark Graham told CNN\u00a0that archived pages of Hoodline\u2019s AI writers were removed last month \u201cat the request of the rights holder of the site.\u201d Chen acknowledged the company requested that the archive\u2019s screenshots of the site be removed from the internet, saying\u00a0\u201csome websites have taken outdated screenshots from months or even years ago to mischaracterize our present-day practices.\u201d \u201cAn empty gesture toward transparency\u201d But experts expressed alarm over Hoodline\u2019s practices, warning that\u00a0it\u00a0exemplifies the potential pitfalls and perils of using AI in journalism, threatening to diminish public trust in news. The way the site uses and discloses AI purposely tricks readers by \u201cmimicking\u201d the look and feel of a \u201cstandards-based local news organization with real journalists,\u201d\u00a0said\u00a0Peter Adams, senior vice president of the News Literacy Project, which aims to\u00a0educate the public on identifying credible information. \u201cIt\u2019s a kind of flagrantly opaque way to dupe people into thinking that they\u2019re reading actual reporting by an actual journalist who has a concern for being fair, for being accurate, for being transparent,\u201d Adams\u00a0told CNN. The small \u201cAI\u201d badge\u00a0that now appears\u00a0next to fake\u00a0author personas on the site is \u201can empty gesture toward transparency rather than actually exercising transparency,\u201d Adams\u00a0added. Chen\u00a0would\u00a0not disclose what AI system Hoodline\u00a0is employing, only calling it \u201cour own proprietary and custom-built software, combined with the most cutting-edge AI partners to craft publish-ready, fact-based article.\u201d Each article, Chen said, is overseen by editors before it is published. Gazetteer previously reported that at least two\u00a0Hoodline\u00a0employees said\u00a0on LinkedIn\u00a0that they\u00a0were based in the Philippines,\u00a0far from the US cities that the outlet purports to cover.\u00a0Chen\u00a0did not respond to CNN\u2019s\u00a0question\u00a0about its staff or where they are located. The\u00a0News/Media\u00a0Alliance, which represents more than 2,200 US publishers, has supported\u00a0news organizations\u00a0taking legal action against AI developers who are harvesting\u00a0news\u00a0content without permission.\u00a0Danielle Coffey,\u00a0the\u00a0group\u2019s chief executive, told CNN that Hoodline\u2019s content \u201cis likely a violation of copyright law.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s another example of stealing our content without permission and without compensation to then turn around and compete with the original work,\u201d Coffey said. \u201cWithout quality news in the first place, this type of content among other practices will become unsustainable over time, as quality news will simply disappear.\u201d Chen told CNN he takes copyright\u00a0law\u00a0very seriously and that\u00a0the outlet has\u00a0\u201cgreatly refined processes with heavy guardrails.\u201d\u00a0The site\u2019s readers, he asserted,\u00a0\u201cappreciate the unbiased nature of our AI-assisted news,\u201d and claimed Hoodline\u2019s visitor traffic has soared twentyfold since the publication was acquired. (Chen did not specify their traffic numbers.) That\u2019s not to say there isn\u2019t a place for AI in a newsroom. It can\u00a0assist journalists\u00a0in research and data processing and\u00a0reduce costs\u00a0in an industry\u00a0struggling\u00a0with tighter budgets.\u00a0Some news organizations, like News Corp., are increasingly inking lucrative partnerships with AI developers like OpenAI\u00a0to help bolster its large language models\u2019 knowledge base. But Hoodline\u2019s use of\u00a0machine-written articles under seemingly human names is not the way to do it, said Felix Simon,\u00a0a\u00a0research fellow in AI and digital news at the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at the University of Oxford. \u201cEmploying AI to help local journalists save time so they can focus on doing more in-depth investigations is qualitatively different from churning out a high amount of low-quality stories that do nothing to provide people with timely and relevant information about what is happening in their community, or that provides\u00a0them with a better understanding of how the things happening around them will end up affecting them,\u201d Simon told CNN. Research conducted by Simon\u00a0and\u00a0Benjamin Toff, a journalism professor at the University of Minnesota, has also found that the public has not embraced the use of AI in news reporting. \u201cWe found that people are somewhat less trusting of news labelled as AI, and there is reason to believe that people won\u2019t be as willing to pay for news generated purely with AI,\u201d he said. Keeping local news alive On\u00a0Hoodline\u2019s\u00a0network of local news sites, it is difficult to find an article not written by the software.\u00a0Much of the\u00a0site\u2019s content\u00a0appears to be\u00a0rewritten\u00a0directly from press releases,\u00a0social media postings\u00a0or aggregated from\u00a0other news organizations.\u00a0Chen\u00a0said the outlet aims to\u00a0\u201calways provide proper attribution\u201d and follow \u201cfair use\u201d practices. \u201cLocal news has been on a terrible downward trend for two decades, and as we expand, Hoodline is able to bring local stories that provide insight into what\u2019s going on at a hyper-local level, even in so-called \u2018news deserts,\u2019\u201d Chen said. The outlet, which is profitable,\u00a0Chen said, plans to hire more human journalists as the company looks\u00a0to\u00a0evolve\u00a0its\u00a0current AI personas into \u201cAI news anchors delivering stories in short-form videos.\u201d The plan will make use of the fake bylines published on the site, eventually turning them into AI news readers, he said. \u201cIt would not make sense for an AI news anchor to be named \u2018Hoodline San Francisco\u2019 or \u2018Researched by Person A & Edited by Persona B.\u2019 This is what we are building toward,\u201d Chen said. Nuala Bishari,\u00a0a former Hoodline reporter,\u00a0wrote in\u00a0a recent column\u00a0for the San Francisco Chronicle that seeing her old job replaced by AI is \u201csurreal.\u201d \u201cOld-fashioned shoe-leather reporting has been replaced by fake people who\u2019ve never set foot in any of the neighborhoods they write about \u2014 because they don\u2019t have feet,\u201d Bishari wrote. But the transformation at Hoodline shows that bigger solutions are needed to keep vital local news reporting alive. \u201cWithout a big shift, journalism as we know it will continue to sputter out,\u201d she wrote.\u201cAnd it isn\u2019t just tiny outlets like Hoodline that are in danger of going extinct or being zombified by AI.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/media/ai-bylines-local-news-hoodline/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "business"}}

Millions of Americans have taken to the skies, hit the road, fired up the barbecue grill and jumped into the pool this weekend to celebrate the start of summer 2024. Analysts are expecting the Memorial Day weekend to usher in yet another summer of strong consumer spending on travel and other leisure activities. The season is already off to a solid start: The Transportation Security Administration said that Thursday was its second-busiest day at airports in history, adding that five of its 10 busiest days ever were this month. AAA projected earlier this month that 43.8 million Americans are driving at least 50 miles this weekend, up 4% from last year\u2019s total and close to the all-time record of 44 million during the 2005 Memorial Day weekend. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen Memorial Day weekend travel numbers like these in almost 20 years,\u201d Paula Twidale, senior vice president at AAA Travel, said in a release. Royal Caribbean\u2019s first-quarter earnings results topped expectations, thanks to strong bookings and robust onboard spending. Company executives said in a earnings call that they\u2019re optimistic for the remainder of the year. If this momentum persists throughout the summer, that would mean solid revenue for leisure businesses such as Royal Caribbean, hotels, restaurants and theme parks, also providing an economic boost to cities with a big tourism scene. A Bank of America Institute analysis released last week expects that to be the case. In a virtual presentation to reporters, the bank\u2019s analysts said the outlook for leisure spending this summer looks promising, based on trends reflected in the bank\u2019s card data, results from a survey of 2,010 respondents and other resources from across the bank. Spending this summer will likely be a little softer than last year\u2019s, they said, but still strong. \u201cThe strength of the data already speaks to it being a solid summer,\u201d David Tinsley, senior economist at the Bank of America Institute, said during the presentation. The bank\u2019s consumer travel survey showed that 72% of people said they\u2019re planning to travel, with 36% saying they\u2019ve already planned their trip. It showed that more younger Americans are planning to take an international trip than older generations, while also planning for longer trips and to spend more. From January through April, spending using a Bank of America card per household was the highest for Japan, South Korea, Switzerland, Colombia and Costa Rica. In April, the share of total in-person international spending through Bank of America was the highest for Europe (32%), followed by Canada and Mexico (23%), then the Caribbean (13%). Domestically, California and Florida have seen some momentum recently when it comes to spending at restaurants. In the first four months of the year, spending rose more than 5% in California from the same period a year ago, while it was mostly flat in Florida. But compared to 2019, restaurant spending in California and Florida is up roughly 15% in each state. Even among respondents making less than $75,000 a year, more than 60% said they\u2019re planning to travel this summer. That figure is north of 80% for respondents making more than $150,000 a year. But the good times may not last forever. Americans have come increasingly under pressure with household debt continuing to climb and delinquencies rising, according to New York Fed data. \u201cIn the first quarter of 2024, credit card and auto loan transition rates into serious delinquency continued to rise across all age groups,\u201d Joelle Scally, regional economic principal within the Household and Public Policy Research Division at the New York Fed, said in a statement. Inflation is also still taking a bite out of people\u2019s budgets and interest rates remain perched at a two-decade high. Economists aren\u2019t expecting a recession this year, but many are estimating the economy will slow over the next 12 months: The latest figures on employment came in weaker than expected. For some, this year\u2019s summer splurge could well be the last hurrah. The dog who inspired Dogecoin has died Kabosu, the dog who launched a thousand \u201cdoge\u201d memes, has died, her owner announced Friday. The Japanese Shiba Inu \u201cfell into a deep sleep\u201d on Friday morning at 18 years of age, Atsuko Sato wrote in a\u00a0blogpost. \u201cOutside the window, birds were singing on a beautiful morning. As I was touching her, she gently passed away,\u201d wrote Sato, a kindergarten teacher in the Japanese city of Sakura. \u201cI think she was the happiest dog in the world.\u201d Kabosu became one of the most recognizable animals on the internet back in 2010 when a photo of her posing with folded paws and a quizzical expression spread across forums such as Reddit. That sparked a proliferation of \u201cdoge\u201d memes, based on an intentional misspelling of the word \u201cdog,\u201d with internet users photoshopping Kabosu\u2019s face onto pastries, landmarks and other animals. The popularity of \u201cdoge\u201d memes was cemented in December 2013, when Kabosu became the face of alternative cryptocurrency dogecoin \u2014 a tongue-in-cheek response to bitcoin that reflected the internet\u2019s love of animal memes.

{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit", "text": "When Apple launched its first Mac computer in 1984, with its iconic Mac smiley-face \u201chello\u201d greeting, it wanted to differentiate itself in the fledgling PC market. The Mac was approachable with its friendly, innovative design \u2013 Apple\u2019s way of setting the Mac apart in the confusing PC landscape. That consumer-friendly mantra still exists today, with Apple carefully curating an easy-breezy yet controlled user experience across its products, including the billions of iPhones used around the world. But the Biden administration believes Apple took that too far. On Thursday, the Department of Justice sued Apple for illegally monopolizing the smartphone market. In a press conference, the government provided a long list of how Apple has allegedly squashed competition with restrictive app store terms, high fees and its \u201cwalled-garden\u201d approach, restricting how third-party companies interact with its brands and services. The company denied the lawsuit\u2019s allegations and said it plans to fight them. Apple added that the lawsuit could empower the government \u201cto take a heavy hand in designing people\u2019s technology.\u201d But if successful, the lawsuit could ripple across Apple\u2019s products and services. Although the suit could take years to play out, here\u2019s a closer look what it may eventually mean for iPhone users: Changes to the App Store If found liable, the company could be forced to change a number of things. One such change is how iPhone users could get greater access to \u201csuper apps\u201d that have been largely restricted before. The term refers to one-stop-shop apps that allow for messaging, ordering food, payment processing and other capabilities all within one platform.  According to Dipanjan Chatterjee, a principal analyst at market research firm Forrester, super apps most threaten Apple\u2019s preeminence in the lives of its customers. \u201cAn offering like WeChat, dubbed China\u2019s everything app, can provide an alternative to the Apple ecosystem for people to communicate, bank, share memories, talk to businesses and more,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cWhat Apple fears most is becoming irrelevant to its customers.\u201d At the same time, super apps like WeChat are created by larger companies and could, therefore, put some smaller companies at a disadvantage. And the concept hasn\u2019t been welcomed much in the US anyway. The US government, however, could argue that lack of interest may be due to Apple\u2019s high share of the smartphone market and its resistance to offer super apps in its store, Chatterjee said. Better interoperability Apple may also be required to offer more support for cross-platform messaging, an issue the company previously said it\u2019s already working on. The company lets iPhone users send high-quality photos and videos to one another, but similar texts to Android phones are slower and grainy. It also maintains those messages in green bubbles, creating a kind of class divide, critics argue. In November, the company said it will add new features, such as read receipts, typing indicators, better support for group chats and higher quality media sharing of images and videos, across platforms to help close the gap. Apple\u2019s move to add support for the standard called RCS (rich communication services) is intended to roll out later this year. RCS is considered the replacement to alternatives such as SMS, or short messaging service, and can work over both Wi-Fi and mobile data. The change followed pressure from both regulators and competitors to more seamlessly work across operating systems. The European Union\u2019s Digital Markets Act, for example, requires companies to make their key services interoperable between platforms. The US government could require the same. More open services Another likely change is how hardware from other companies, such as smartwatches, will interact with the Apple range of devices and software, including the iPhone and Apple\u2019s services like Fitness+. The company has also required Apple Watch users to own iOS devices as a way to keep them locked into its existing ecosystem. Chatterjee said making this change would have both positives and negatives. \u201cThe net result would reside somewhere along the spectrum of access to more and cheaper options but also the devaluation of the customer experience that is so highly prized by Apple\u2019s customers,\u201d he said. The Biden administration has also taken issue with Apple\u2019s lack of support for mobile cloud services. Loosening this could allow users to access games and other cloud-based apps without having to pay for pricey hardware. Inside the debate The DOJ lawsuit claims Apple\u2019s behavior has illegally hindered competition, kept its customers locked into its products and prevented other companies from innovating. Although the Biden administration will have to prove these harms, some critics say any potential changes Apple could make will negatively impact the user experience. David McQueen, a research director at ABI Research, said he recognizes that the content and applications market should be open, and Apple needs to avoid monopolistic advantages that can restrict competition, push up prices or block innovation. But Apple\u2019s success stems in part to its tight grip on its products and services, keeping things intuitive and seamless. \u201cIf Apple is forced to comply, it could potentially spell the end to the provision of this consistent and unified user experience, although by the same token, consumers will be open to a greater choice of apps and services, helping more developers and providers,\u201d McQueen said. Chatterjee noted some people are drawn to the Apple family of products precisely because of the carefully managed ecosystem\u2019s ease of use. Apple may have to work that much harder to preserve the integrity of its experience, but any changes probably won\u2019t be enough to make customers to leave and go elsewhere. \u201cThe vast majority of Apple customers would probably be happier with some more choice and lower prices as long as it did not hamper their levels of customer experience, which is threatened by the less control Apple has over the experience,\u201d Chatterjee said. But he added those currently outside of the Apple ecosystem will likely benefit by \u201cplugging in opportunistically without having to go all in with Apple.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_media_nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash", "text": "Cesar Conde has a decision to make \u2014 and it\u2019s not an especially difficult one. The NBCUniversal News Group chair is facing a torrent of backlash from his own staff after greenlighting the hire of former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel as a paid network contributor. Over the last 24 hours, the most prominent and recognizable NBC News and MSNBC personalities have voiced strong displeasure with the company\u2019s decision to welcome McDaniel to \u201cthe team.\u201d And they\u2019re not doing it via anonymous comments to the press. They\u2019re doing it on the record on NBCU\u2019s own air. Chuck Todd broke the dam on Sunday\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with a set of candid comments about the hiring, and Rachel Maddow capped the flood of backlash Monday night with a blistering 30-minute monologue eviscerating the network\u2019s leadership for the \u201cinexplicable\u201d move. Suffice to say, NBCU News Group is in unprecedented territory. Never has a network\u2019s C-suite ever been so thoroughly flogged by its most high-profile stars in such no holds barred fashion. Saying that Conde simply has a crisis on his hands would be a contender for understatement of the year. It\u2019s a five-alarm fire at NBCU News Group, and one of Conde\u2019s own making. While NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown were most directly responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring, a decision that MSNBC boss Rashida Jones did not object to it at the time, the buck ultimately stops with Conde, who hold the real power at the Peacock Network. McDaniel\u2019s hiring could not have happened without Conde\u2019s blessing. It does not take a brilliant political mind with prescient foresight to understand that hiring McDaniel would ignite a firestorm of outrage \u2014 from both within 30 Rock and outside it. Conde, someone who ostensibly supports American democracy, should have rejected McDaniel\u2019s hiring on the grounds that NBCU News Group could not put someone on its payroll who tried to subvert the 2020 vote. As so many of NBCU\u2019s staffers have underscored, the objection to McDaniel is not that she is a Republican. It\u2019s not even that she is a Donald Trump-supporting Republican. It\u2019s that she was an active participant in the plot to overthrow the last presidential election. That is not to even mention McDaniel\u2019s years of demonizing the press, smearing the journalists who work at NBC News and MSNBC as she sought to destroy the credibility of the organization that she ran to after being chased out of the RNC. The notion put forward by NBC that it needed to hire McDaniel to bring its viewers \u201can insider\u2019s perspective on national politics and the future of the Republican Party\u201d is absurd. If that\u2019s the case, the network should move to hire free agents like Tucker Carlson or Candace Owens. They too have their hands on the pulse of the Republican Party. In fact, they represent much more of where the GOP stands today than McDaniel. So, using NBC\u2019s logic, why not hire them? (Spoiler: News organizations rightfully have established basic standards for paid contributors. Asking that your employees have a commitment to democracy, to the truth, and to basic decency is not a big ask.) But even if Conde has no allegiance to basic democratic principles, which this hire calls into question, given that he is known to be a political player who cares deeply about his own image in the press, he should have been wise enough to foresee that hiring McDaniel would be an ill-conceived move. How this did not occur to Conde is unfathomable and shows a tremendous lack of judgment. Even more bizarre is Conde\u2019s management, or lack thereof, since the controversy erupted. It was clear early on that his employees at NBC News and MSNBC did not support McDaniel\u2019s hiring. If that was not evident on Friday, it was clear as day on Sunday after \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d The network\u2019s employees were not only flabbergasted and demoralized by the move, but absolutely enraged by it. At that point, the writing should have been on the wall for Conde \u2014 as it was for every other media executive that I have spoken with over the last 24 hours. It is evident that McDaniel has no real future as an NBC analyst and the decision to bring her on as a contributor will have to be reversed. After all, which NBC or MSNBC program is going to invite her on after all of this? The only real question for Conde after the Sunday morning scolding should have been how he chose to back out of the deal in the least painful way possible. To be fully honest, I very much expected a Sunday evening announcement from NBC, one that would have earned praise from the company\u2019s staff and quickly been swept away by the rush of Trump news Monday morning. But no such announcement came. Instead, Conde has allowed the mess to spiral absolutely out of control. MSNBC\u2019s top stars hammered the network\u2019s leadership throughout the day Monday over the hire. NBC News\u2019 Guild blasted Conde, saying in a statement that under him the company had quietly laid off employees over the last month and instead chosen to \u201cprioritize an election denier over its reporters.\u201d The already severe crisis was allowed to blossom into one of the worst corporate public relations catastrophes in recent memory. All the while, Conde has remained silent. I asked his spokesperson, Stephen Labaton, on Monday whether the NBCU News Group boss had any comment on the situation. Does he have any regret? I didn\u2019t get an on-the-record response. Suffice to say, however, that what Conde does moving forward will say a lot about his character and commitment to democratic values. It will also say a lot about the NBCU News Group and what type of organization it is. In her biting monologue on Monday night, however, Maddow did offer Conde a way out of this mess. \u201cMistakes will be made,\u201d Maddow said.\u201dBut our resilience as a democracy is going to be recognizing when decisions are bad ones and reversing those bad decisions.

{"id": "2024_05_24_media_newsmax-smartmatic-defamation-case", "text": "The right-wing cable channel Newsmax denied Friday that it intentionally destroyed or concealed internal emails in an ongoing defamation case filed by voting technology company Smartmatic over\u00a0the network\u2019s airing of false\u00a0claims about the 2020 election. Lawyers for Smartmatic previously claimed Newsmax \u201cconcealed over 200,000 documents\u201d and \u201cmade multiple material misrepresentations to the court,\u201d by falsely asserting\u00a0it\u00a0had turned over everything before the discovery process wrapped up. But the network said in filings Friday that it never meant to hide anything, and that the vast majority of the supposedly new materials were duplicates of old files. Newsmax said the allegations are\u00a0\u201cimplausible inferences\u201d and \u201cnothing more than speculation.\u201d In the wake of the 2020 election, Newsmax and other right-wing media outlets gave\u00a0airtime\u00a0to the\u00a0false\u00a0assertion that electronic voting machines had switched votes from then-President Donald Trump to Joe Biden, costing Trump the election. No evidence has ever been found to support the claim. In the months that followed, Smartmatic filed a defamation lawsuit against Newsmax and other right-wing outlets and figures, including Fox News, Rudy Giuliani and conspiracy theorist Mike Lindell.\u00a0Smartmatic and Newsmax have\u00a0since\u00a0been embroiled in the\u00a0years-long defamation case,\u00a0which\u00a0is slated to go to trial this September in Delaware Superior Court, barring an out-of-court settlement. In court filings, Smartmatic claimed some of the 200,000 documents include texts among Newsmax executives discussing the \u201cdecision not to call the (2020) election.\u201d Parts of the court papers are redacted, but the context suggests that Newsmax also turned over new emails where top executives disparaged their own shows and reporters. Smartmatic further accused Newsmax of intentionally \u201cdestroying relevant evidence\u201d by deleting texts and emails from senior officials. They claimed this \u201ccover-up\u201d was \u201ccarefully calculated\u201d to block Smartmatic from ever seeing the material. They claimed Newsmax CEO Chris Ruddy let his texts from 2020 get deleted, despite knowing they needed to be saved. \u201cRepeatedly, Newsmax has kept documents showing its actual malice and bad motive out of Smartmatic\u2019s hands,\u201d Smartmatic wrote in a court filing that was made public last week. \u201cThese were not isolated mistakes. This was by design. Newsmax has intentionally destroyed and concealed crucial evidence that is damaging to its case.\u201d But in its response Friday, Newsmax said the entire dispute over the newly found files is simply \u201can attempt (by Smartmatic) to manufacture an issue where none exists.\u201d \u201cMany of the documents Smartmatic claims were \u2018newly produced\u2019 and bear on \u2018key issues\u2019 were already in Smartmatic\u2019s possession in duplicate or near duplicate versions having been produced by Newsmax,\u201d the network said in filings made public Friday. Lawyers for the network said it transitioned legal teams in January and\u00a0reviewed\u00a0its previous document productions. They said they realized that some documents hadn\u2019t been turned over, but this was fixed \u201cas soon as Newsmax discovered this.\u201d Barring a settlement between the two parties,\u00a0the September trial\u00a0over false claims of vote rigging in the 2020 election\u00a0is set\u00a0to coincide with the 2024 election season,\u00a0as leading\u00a0Republicans continue to express doubt over whether Biden legitimately won the\u00a0previous\u00a0election. Fox News famously paid more than $787 million to Dominion Voting Systems to settle a case last year\u00a0over similar 2020 election lies on its airwaves. Newsmax, which is owned by Ruddy,\u00a0isn\u2019t a\u00a0right-wing\u00a0media juggernaut\u00a0like Fox, but\u00a0remains\u00a0influential in the pro-Trump media ecosystem, even with its smaller audience. The network\u2019s lineup features\u00a0former\u00a0Fox personalities like\u00a0Eric Bolling\u00a0and Greta Van Susteren, controversial Trump White House official\u00a0Sebastian Gorka\u00a0and Clinton ally-turned-foe Dick Morris. A trial could put Newsmax\u2019s financial future in peril, but there is one major difference between the Newsmax and Fox cases.\u00a0In the weeks following the election, Smartmatic threatened to sue Newsmax in 2020,\u00a0the network\u00a0ran an on-air segment\u00a0and\u00a0published an article saying there was \u201cno evidence\u201d that Smartmatic or Dominion ever \u201cmanipulated votes in the 2020 election.\u201d Newsmax also faces a\u00a0separate\u00a0defamation suit from Dominion.

{"id": "2024_03_12_success_equal-pay-day-2024", "text": "March 12 marks Equal Pay Day in the United States, a symbolic date representing the number of days women have to work into the current year just to make the same amount of money men made in the prior one. Put another way, to make 12 months\u2019 worth of a man\u2019s median wages, a woman has to work about 14.5 months. In dollars and cents, for every dollar a man earns, a woman is paid 84 cents, according to the National Committee on Pay Equity and the Equal Pay Today campaign. That\u2019s based on earnings data for full-time, year-round workers from the US Census in 2022, which was the most recent full-year data set available. If part-time workers and those not employed year-round are included, the gender pay gap is worse, at 78 cents on the dollar, said Deborah Vagins, national campaign director of Equal Rights Advocates and director of Equal Pay Today. The size of the actual wage gap between men and women will widen or narrow depending on age, level of education, choice of occupation and tenure, as well as race and ethnicity. The gender pay gap is typically widest when comparing the earnings of White men to Black, Hispanic or Native American women. And, generally speaking, the gap is narrower in a given job when men and women are in their early- to mid-20s (i.e., when they are new to the workforce and before children come along), and also when comparing wages by title, tenure and education level within a given field. But no matter how you slice and dice the data, there are very few scenarios in which women on average earn the same as men. Indeed, in its latest analysis of median weekly earnings last year by occupation, the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research found that women earned less than men not only in all 20 of the largest occupations for men but also in all 20 of the largest occupations for women. Among the largest occupations for women, the most egregious pay gaps were among financial managers (women earned 71% of every dollar a man earns), retail salesperson (72%), education and child care administrators (79%), administrative assistants (80%) and managers (81%). The narrowest gap was among cashiers, where women almost have pay parity (98%) with their male colleagues. Same old (and annoying) story every year While the overall gender pay gap has been narrowing over time \u2014 for example, Equal Pay Day in 2005 was April 19, a full five weeks later than this year\u2019s \u2014 the very fact that \ufeffsuch a gap exists at all in 2024 is a reminder that employers and society still have work to do in recognizing the value of women\u2019s contributions at work. \u201cThe gender wage gap is a national disgrace,\u201d said\u00a0Jamila Taylor, IWPR\u2019s president and CEO, in a statement. \u201cEven in professions typically dominated by women, men earn more for doing the same job. Equal pay for equal work has been the law of the land for more than a half-century, yet\u00a0women still cannot get fair treatment when it comes to employment and earnings. And it\u2019s worse for women of color, who face rampant racial discrimination in the workforce in addition to ongoing pay inequities.\u201d The good news is that there are now multiple efforts that may over time help reduce the problem. They include an increasing number of state-level pay transparency laws and bans on employers asking job candidates for their salary histories, which can help chronically underpaid women gain more of an equal footing when they apply for new jobs. There is also now a ban on federal government agencies asking job candidates\u2019 for their salary history and a proposed rule that would prohibit federal contractors from doing the same, as well as requiring them to post in their job ads the pay for given positions. But Vagins and others in the campaign for equal pay also want to see action at the federal legislative level, supporting two bills: the Salary Transparency Act and the Paycheck Fairness Act, which have been introduced in the US House and Senate multiple times. For instance, the Paycheck Fairness Act would, according to Equal Pay Today, \u201cbar retaliation against workers who voluntarily discuss or disclose their wages; close loopholes that have allowed employers to pay women less than men for the same work \u2026 [and] ensure women can receive the same robust remedies for sex-based pay discrimination that are currently available to those subjected to discrimination based on race and ethnicity.\u201d Absent such federal laws requiring all employers to make equal pay more of an imperative, Vagins said, achieving true pay parity for women will be slow in coming.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/12/success/equal-pay-day-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_05_30_business_schumer-senate-democrats-call-for-doj-to-probe-big-oil", "text": "Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and nearly two dozen Democrats pressed the Justice Department on Thursday to launch an industry-wide investigation into Big Oil for alleged collusion and price fixing. In a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland, Schumer and his colleagues expressed \u201cserious concern\u201d about \u201calarming\u201d allegations from federal regulators that a\u00a0Texas oil tycoon tried to conspire with OPEC\u00a0to inflate oil and gasoline prices. \u201cThe federal government must use every tool to prevent and prosecute collusion and price fixing that may have increased gasoline, diesel fuel, heating oil and jet fuel costs in a way that has materially harmed virtually every American household and business,\u201d the letter from Senate Democrats said. The lawmakers urged the DOJ to investigate the oil industry, \u201chold accountable any liable actors\u201d and halt illegal activity. The letter, led by Schumer, was signed by 22 other senators, including Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Amy Klobuchar, Bernie Sanders and Dick Durbin. The letter shows how Democrats are\u00a0stepping up pressure on Big Oil\u00a0following bombshell accusations earlier this month by the Federal Trade Commission against Scott Sheffield, the longtime CEO of a leading Texas oil producer. Last week, congressional Democrats launched an investigation into whether other US oil companies colluded with each other and OPEC. The FTC accused Sheffield, the founder of Pioneer Natural Resources, of attempting to collude with OPEC and its allies to keep supply low \u2014 a charge the former CEO has strongly denied. Regulators cited hundreds of text messages Sheffield exchanged with OPEC officials discussing pricing, production and oil market dynamics. Sheffield \u201cheld repeated, private conversations with high-ranking OPEC representatives assuring them that Pioneer and its Permian Basin rivals were working hard to keep oil output artificially low,\u201d the\u00a0FTC found\u00a0in its investigation. \u201cThe strategy appears to have worked,\u201d Schumer and his colleagues wrote to the DOJ. The lawmakers argued that \u201cindustry collusion\u201d may have contributed to sharply lowering US oil production, boosting gas prices by 94 cents a gallon from pre-pandemic times to today and costing the average household up to $500 per car in annual fuel costs. Schumer and his colleagues said that while the FTC has banned Sheffield from serving on Exxon\u2019s board following its takeover of Pioneer, \u201conly the DOJ can prosecute and fully redress the alleged anticompetitive behavior in the oil sector.\u201d The lawmakers noted that the Sherman Act calls for a fine of up to $100 million for corporations and up to $1 million and 10 years in prison for individuals guilty of price fixing. \u201cThe DOJ must protect consumers, small businesses, and the public from petroleum-market collusion, and an important part of that mission means seeking full restitution and imposing all penalties supported by the facts and the law,\u201d Schumer and his colleagues wrote. White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told CNN in a statement that while the White House won\u2019t comment on specific cases, President Joe Biden has \u201cmade clear that any illegal collusion between big corporations is unacceptable and rips off hardworking families, including if it raises prices at the pump.\u201d \u201cPresident Biden will continue to call out corporations when they break the law and engage in anti-competitive practices that increase prices for families,\u201d Jean-Pierre said, \u201cand he\u2019ll continue to call out big corporations and record profits \u2013 including Big Oil companies \u2013 to lower costs for consumers.\u201d Sheffield responded to the FTC\u2019s allegations on Tuesday by arguing the agency mischaracterized the facts and evidence and calling for it to rescind the order against the former CEO. In a statement, Sheffield said the FTC is \u201cwrong to imply that I ever engaged in, promoted or even suggested any form of anti-competitive behavior.\u201d \u201cPublicly and unjustifiably vilifying me will have a chilling effect on the ability of business leaders in any sector of our economy to address shareholder demands and to exercise their constitutionally protected right to advocate for their industries,\u201d Sheffield said. The oil industry also pushed back against the claims from Democrats and criticizing the White House\u2019s economic policies. \u201cThe United States is the largest crude oil producer, leading the world in new oil production since 2020. This increase in American energy production has been a stabilizing force for consumers here at home and around the world\u2014especially in the face of supply cuts from OPEC,\u201d Andrea Woods, spokesperson for the American Petroleum Institute, said in a statement. \u201dWhile we don\u2019t know the details of the FTC\u2019s allegations against one individual,\u201d Woods said, \u201cthe reality is that U.S. producers answered the call to meet growing energy demand, despite a spate of inflationary policies from this administration that threaten our long-term energy security.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/business/schumer-senate-democrats-call-for-doj-to-probe-big-oil/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2022_04_27_business_diamonds-manmade-demand", "text": "It\u2019s proposal season, and engagements are on the rise. So are factory-made diamond sales. Not that you\u2019d know the difference. Man-made diamonds look the same as naturally occurring ones. The only noticeable difference is the price tag. \u201cThe result is really stunning,\u201d said Edahn Golan, an independent diamond industry analyst. He said March data showed the number of engagement rings sold that featured a manufactured diamond jumped 63% compared to last year, while the number of engagement rings sold with a natural diamond declined 25% in the same period. Going back by another month, to February, the data showed the number of rings sold with lab diamonds that month surged even more, to 80% compared to a year earlier while the number fell by 13% for natural diamond engagement rings.  \u201cThe big fear in the natural diamonds industry is that consumers will start accepting lab-grown diamonds in engagement rings,\u201d he said. Too late. \u201cIt\u2019s actually happening.\u201d  Tide is shifting Why are consumers flocking to man-made diamonds? Cost is the most obvious reason. The average retail price of the most popular one carat round man-made diamond for an engagement ring in March was $2,318, Golan said. \u201cThis is substantially less \u2013 as much as 73% cheaper \u2013 than a natural diamond of the same size, cut and clarity as the man-made diamond, which would cost $8,740,\u201d he said. Plus, the lower cost allows couples to buy a bigger stone.  \u201cA lab diamond is a real diamond, but maybe it took a few weeks to make it,\u201d said Golan. \u201cNatural diamonds were formed over 800 million to three billion years and there isn\u2019t an infinite supply of them.\u201d  This makes natural diamonds quite a bit more expensive, and prices are likely to rise as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has tightened the supply chain for natural raw diamonds. The sanctions directly target Alrosa, partly owned by the Russian government, which the US government identified as the world\u2019s largest diamond mining company, accounting for 28% of global diamond output. Man-made diamonds are also becoming popular as consumers are more aware and educated about them, said Dan Moran, a third-generation diamond expert and owner of LA-based fine jeweler Concierge Diamonds. Moran said the typical buyer of man-made diamonds is typically younger than 40 and very budget conscious. Mined diamonds have a controversial history that\u2019s tied to the use of child labor in some African diamond mines as well as sales of illegally-traded \u201cconflict diamonds\u201d that fund conflict in war-torn areas. Among Millennials and Gen Z, their eco-conscious mindset and ethical concerns about natural diamond sourcing is another factor influencing their preference for non-traditional engagement rings, according to a report from wedding planning website The Knot. Small but growing share of the diamond market Although its slice is growing, the market share for man-made diamonds remains relatively small. Currently, about 7% of the specialty diamond jewelry market is represented by man-made diamonds, up from 3% in 2020, said Golan.  Some major jewelry retailers are driving the effort to take man-made diamonds mainstream. In 2021, the world\u2019s largest jewelry company, Pandora\n            \n                (PANDY), made a major shift by announcing it would stop using mined diamonds and would swap to lab-created diamonds in its jewelry.  Pandora said it\u2019s instituting the change as part of an effort to sell sustainable jewelry, and also because consumers increasingly are asking for it. Signet,\n            \n                (SIG) the largest jewelry company in the United States (which owns Zales, Kay Jewelers and Jared chains) called out the popularity of lab diamond jewelry in its March earnings call with analysts. Calling it a \u201cfast-growing category\u201d in its jewelry portfolio, Signet CEO Virginia Drosos told analysts that lab-created diamonds are among the big jewelry trends she expects this year.  The company said it has expanded its man-made bridal jewelry selection in both its Zales and Kay Jewelers stores in response to the increased demand.  Fine jewelry brand Charles and Colvard, which makes lab-created diamonds, said consumers don\u2019t just want to look good with the jewelry they are wearing, they also want to feel good about it. \u201cAs the momentum for conscious consumerism grows, the surge towards lab grown diamonds isn\u2019t surprising,\u201d said Don O\u2019Connell, president and CEO of Charles & Colvard. \u201c[Consumers] want to know the origins of their stones and be reassured they\u2019re conflict-free. They\u2019re embracing the choice to purchase a piece of fine jewelry that aligns with their values.\u201d Lab-grown diamond brand VRAI said the pandemic, too, has sparked attention and action toward social and environmental issues. It said consumers are being more thoughtful and reassessing their purchasing habits, as well as the companies and industries they are supporting. There is, however, one important consideration for anyone buying lab-created diamonds: Man-made diamonds have little resale value.  So while you may not be able to tell a natural diamond from a factory made variety, someone with a trained eye can, said Golan. Once a stone is identified as a factory diamond, even though you paid a lot less for it, you also won\u2019t get much for it.  But the value of a ring isn\u2019t just monetary. \u201cAs a professional in the industry, I am asked all the time by people about what I think about a ring they have,\u201d said Moran, of Concierge Jewelers. \u201cI always say, if you love it, be happy with it. An engagement ring is a symbol of commitment and enduring love.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/27/business/diamonds-manmade-demand/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "business"}}

This is inaccurate,\u201d Joe Erlinger,\u00a0president of McDonald\u2019s USA, wrote in an open letter posted to the company\u2019s website on Wednesday. \u201cThe average price of a Big Mac in the U.S. was $4.39 in 2019,\u201d he said. \u201cDespite a global pandemic and historic rises in supply chain costs, wages and other inflationary pressures in the years that followed, the average cost is now $5.29. That\u2019s an increase of 21% (not 100%).\u201d What Erlinger wants customers to know is not that high-priced McDonald\u2019s burgers don\u2019t exist at all. He just wants them to know that the burgers that have been cited as proof of radically higher prices are not the norm. \u201cIt frustrates and worries me, and many of our franchisees, when I hear about an $18 Big Mac meal being sold \u2014 even if it was at one location in the U.S. out of more than 13,700,\u201d he said. \u201cMore worrying, though, is when people believe that this is the rule and not the exception, or when folks start to suggest that the prices of a Big Mac have risen 100% since 2019.\u201d Online, people have been airing their fast food price grievances. But they\u2019re not just griping: Customers are pulling back on spending, too. Diners, frustrated by higher prices, are not going out to eat as often and spending less when they do, causing fast food sales to slow and traffic to dip. Erlinger is fighting back because McDonald\u2019s pricey burgers have become something of a symbol of elevated fast food prices. And being seen as overpriced could hamper sales and reputation, especially at McDonald\u2019s. \u201cIt\u2019s imperative that we continue to keep affordability at the forefront for our customers,\u201d McDonald\u2019s CEO Chris Kempczinski said during an April 30 analyst call. \u201cWe literally wrote the playbook on value, and we are committed to upholding our leadership within the industry.\u201d To win back consumers, the burger chain is also reportedly considering adding a $5 value meal to the menu for a limited time. Earlier this month, the Wall Street Journal reported\u00a0that McDonald\u2019s is planning to start running its $5 meal promotion at the end of June. A recent statement from the National Owner\u2019s Association, a group for McDonald\u2019s franchise operators, indicated that operators were still deciding whether to adopt the promotion, which would include chicken nuggets, fries, a soft drink and either a McDouble or McChicken sandwich for $5. A NOA representative declined to comment on the status of the vote. Erlinger nodded to the possibility of a national $5 value meal in his letter. \u201cI fully expect the prices at your local McDonald\u2019s to be an area of conversation and focus in the coming months,\u201d he said. \u201cAs it does, I hope you\u2019ll see the programs we\u2019re launching nationally and locally as meaningful to you.\u201d \u2014 CNN\u2019s Jordan Valinsky contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/business/mcdonalds-burger-prices/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "business"}}

Beijing has now removed restrictions from eight abattoirs but two remain subject to import bans, the government said. China imposed the bans between 2020 and 2022, around the same time it barred imports of a swathe of commodities including coal, timber and wine from Australia after Canberra called for an independent investigation into the origin of COVID-19. The bans applied to certain abattoirs but did not affect others, which meant Australia was still able to ship beef to China. \u201cIt was difficult for those particular abattoirs but we still saw beef flowing,\u201d said Matt Dalgleish, an analyst at agricultural consultants Episode 3. He said the removal of the restrictions should still boost Australian shipments to China, which have already risen to their highest level since 2020 as a shrinking cattle herd in the United States, Australia\u2019s main competitor, reduces US exports. Lower US supply may have been one reason for China\u2019s action, Dalgleish said. China was Australia\u2019s second-biggest beef export market last year, receiving 240,000 tons worth around $1.6 billion, Australian trade data shows. Beijing has lifted most of the barriers it imposed on Australian goods since a change of government in Canberra two years ago.

The National Highway Traffic Administration is gathering information\u00a0on the fire, as well. \u201cThe safety and security of our customers is our primary concern,\u201d a Nissan spokesperson said in a statement in response to an email asking about the fire. \u201cWe have opened an investigation into this incident.\u201d The\u00a0Hills\u2019 Murano was recalled by Nissan\u00a0in 2016 and 2019, to fix a problem that could allow brake fluid to leak and start a fire, even while the vehicle is parked. At the time, owners were warned to park their vehicles outside and away from buildings until the issue was repaired because of fire risks. A search on NHTSA\u2019s website indicated there was an outstanding unrepaired recall on the Hills\u2019 Murano. The couple said a local fire investigator suggested the unrepaired recall could have caused the fire. But the Hills remember getting the work done and provided CNN with a photograph of the receipt from a local Nissan dealership that showed the repair was made. CNN has not confirmed whether the receipt is authentic. The Hills said that because the recall work had been done, the possibility of a fire wasn\u2019t something that crossed their minds. Philip Hill had been fixing the garage, so the couple\u2019s two cars were parked in the driveway. Otherwise, the Murano would have been parked inside the garage adjoining the house. \u201cAs you can see from the video, that vehicle is so close to the house,\u201d Philip Hill told CNN. \u201cMinutes later, the house could have gone up.\u201d As it was, the garage door melted from the flames, they said. The Hills credit a neighbor\u2019s dog with saving them and their three children. The neighbor was able to call 911 before the Hills, after being alerted by her dog. The intense flames from the burning Nissan also damaged the side of the family\u2019s other car, a 2012 Mercedes C-class, leaving it unusable. Initially, the Hills were concerned they might have been victims of vandalism. But\u00a0they said\u00a0the video footage from their Nest doorbell camera\u00a0clearly\u00a0showed the vehicle spontaneously combusting. Nissan took possession of the Murano on Wednesday to study it more closely, the Hills said. As surprising as the Hills\u2019 situation may seem, vehicle fires are not uncommon. In 2022, an estimated 188,500 car and truck fires blazed in the United States, an average of more than 500 a day, according to the National Fire Protection Association. Vehicle fires caused 610 civilian deaths that year, according the NFPA.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/business/nissan-suv-driveway-explosion/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_22_media_ronna-mcdaniel-nbc", "text": "NBC News on Friday announced that it had hired Ronna McDaniel, the former Republican National Committee chair who has repeatedly\u00a0attacked the network and its journalists,\u00a0assailed the\u00a0news\u00a0media as \u201cfake news\u201d and promoted false claims around the 2020\u00a0vote,\u00a0as an on-air commentator\u00a0ahead of the 2024 presidential election. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be a more important moment to have a voice like Ronna\u2019s on the team,\u201d Carrie Budoff Brown, senior vice president of politics at NBC News, said in a memo\u00a0to staff. McDaniel exited the RNC earlier this month after leading the organization since 2016. During her time as chair, McDaniel repeatedly attacked the press, which has become increasingly popular in Republican circles over the last several years as Donald Trump demonizes journalists and news institutions. McDaniel echoed many such attacks, labeling the press as \u201cfake news\u201d and calling the media \u201ccorrupt.\u201d At times, she even targeted NBC News\u00a0and MSNBC\u00a0with dishonest attacks. In 2019, for instance, McDaniel accused Richard Engel, NBC News\u2019 chief foreign correspondent, of \u201cactively cheering for an economic downturn.\u201d \u201cHow can NBC let him keep his job when he\u2019s made his bias so clear?\u201d McDaniel asked. McDaniel has a lengthier history attacking the progressive cable news channel MSNBC, which she will appear on in her new role. In recent years, she has repeatedly attacked the channel for \u201cspreading lies\u201d and blasted those she described as the network\u2019s \u201cprimetime propagandists.\u201d An NBC spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment about her attacks on the news media and NBC. In her role as RNC chief, McDaniel also fanned the flames of election denialism after the 2020 presidential contest. McDaniel was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d The Michigan Department of State\u2019s office condemned her claims of supposed voter fraud in the wake of the election, stating they had \u201cno merit.\u201d\u00a0The state\u2019s \u201celections were conducted fairly, effectively and transparently and are an accurate reflection of the will of Michigan voters,\u201d it said in a\u00a0detailed fact check\u00a0posted online. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Chris Wallace last year, McDaniel defended her claims of voting \u201cirregularity\u201d in the election. \u201cI think saying that there were problems with 2020 is very real. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s election denying,\u201d McDaniel told Wallace. \u201cI\u2019m from Wayne County. We had a woman send a note saying I\u2019m being told to backdate ballots. We had to look into that. That\u2019s deeply concerning. When you have friends who are poll-watching and being kicked out, that\u2019s deeply concerning. We have every right to look at that.\u201d In the interview,\u00a0Wallace pressed McDaniel if she believed Biden legitimately won the election. \u201cI think there were lots of problems with 2020. Ultimately, he won the election\u00a0but there were lots of problems with the 2020 election,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think he won it fair. I don\u2019t. I\u2019m not going to say that.\u201d NBC\u2019s hiring of McDaniel, however, plays into a recent trend at the\u00a0network\u2019s outlets, which has seemingly softened its stance on Trump as he inches toward the Republican nomination for president. Earlier this month, CNBC hosted Trump for a lengthy phone interview in which the network\u2019s anchors allowed him to peddle lies and conspiracy theories on air\u00a0without scrutiny. MSNBC has even started carrying Trump\u2019s remarks live on television, a practice that the network boasted for years it would not do. Star host Rachel Maddow, who has said carrying Trump\u2019s lies\u00a0on the air\u00a0is dangerous, even objected to the network broadcasting a recent speech from the presumptive Republican nominee, calling it \u201cirresponsible.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/22/media/ronna-mcdaniel-nbc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_30_tech_china-investment-advanced-ev-batteries-intl-hnk", "text": "China plans to invest around 6 billion yuan ($845 million) to develop  next-generation battery technology powering electrical vehicles (EVs), even as its industrial policy has sparked overcapacity concerns and become a key target of US and European complaints. A total of six companies \u2014 including CATL, the world\u2019s biggest battery manufacturer, and major automakers like BYD and Geely \u2014 are eligible for government support to develop all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs), the official China Daily newspaper reported Wednesday, citing unnamed industrial sources. The \u201cunprecedented\u201d project will be led by the relevant government ministries and commissions, it said, without giving details. ASSBs are a new technology that improves on traditional lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) using a solid, conductive electrolyte instead of liquid or gel-form material. They are less likely to catch fire or explode than conventional batteries and have higher energy density, so they are believed to be safer and more powerful. However, the powerful batteries are not widely available at the moment due to their high cost and difficulty in being mass produced. The news of Beijing\u2019s intended investment comes at a fraught time for China\u2019s trade relations with the West. Earlier this month, the Biden administration imposed major new tariffs on Chinese EVs, advanced batteries and other goods. American officials say they want to protect US jobs and businesses from problems posed by the overproduction of certain products in the world\u2019s second largest economy. The European Commission is set to announce early next month its own decision on Chinese EV tariffs, which could spell trouble for Chinese EV makers that export hundreds of thousands of cars to Europe every year. But Beijing is still ramping up efforts to\u00a0accelerate EV production\u00a0as it tries to counter a property-induced economic slowdown and promote a low-carbon economy. Global automakers and tech companies are also working on ASSBs. In January, Toyota (TM) said it would launch vehicles with solid-state batteries in a few years, according to Reuters.\u00a0Samsung SDI said in March that it would begin mass producing solid-state batteries in 2027. Volkswagen has also been trying to develop the batteries with US startup Quantum Scape. Chinese rivals are also upping the ante. GAC Group, a state-owned automaker based in Guangzhou, said in November that it had achieved a breakthrough in solid-state batteries and would roll out vehicles with them in 2026.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/tech/china-investment-advanced-ev-batteries-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl", "text": "Sam Altman has agreed to return to lead OpenAI, the company said in a Tuesday post on X, just days after his surprise ouster as chief executive sparked an employee revolt that threatened to undermine what has been the leading company in the fledgling artificial intelligence industry. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman wrote that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft, which is the ChatGPT maker\u2019s biggest financial backer. The announcement appears to bring to an end days of chaos for the AI industry that included negotiations over who should lead OpenAI and how the firm should be run, as well as broader discussions about just how fast the arms race to develop AI technology should be moving. The details of Altman\u2019s firing and re-hiring remain murky. In its announcement Friday, OpenAI claimed that Altman had been insufficiently \u201ccandid\u201d with the board. That ambiguous language sent the rumor mill flying. But a key factor in Altman\u2019s ouster was the presence of\u00a0tensions between Altman, who favored pushing AI development more aggressively, and members of the original OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the crisis. As of Monday morning, Nadella had announced that Altman, along with fellow OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, would be joining Microsoft to lead a new AI research division. OpenAI said it had hired former Twitch chief Emmett Shear as interim CEO. But then hundreds of OpenAI employees, nearly the company\u2019s entire staff, threatened to leave, potentially for Microsoft, if the company\u2019s board didn\u2019t resign and reinstate Altman as CEO. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it invested billions in to help bolster its ambitions in developing AI, which many in Silicon Valley think will be the most important wave of technological advancement in the coming decades. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Microsoft CEO\u00a0Satya Nadella said on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d Altman\u2019s vision to quickly roll out and commercialize AI tools also appears to have won out. Publicly, Altman has long cautioned about risks posed by AI, and he\u202fhas pledged to lawmakers and customers that he would move OpenAI forward responsibly. \u201cIs [AI] gonna be like the printing press that diffused knowledge, power and learning widely across the landscape that empowered ordinary, everyday individuals that led to greater flourishing, that led above all to greater liberty?\u201d he said in a May Senate subcommittee hearing pressing for regulation. \u201cOr is it gonna be more like the atom bomb \u2014 huge technological breakthrough, but the consequences (severe, terrible) continue to haunt us to this day?\u201d But inside the company, Altman had been pushing to bring products to market more quickly and to sell them for a profit. Altman announced a few weeks ago at OpenAI\u2019s first-ever developer day that the company would make tools available so anyone could create their own version of ChatGPT. OpenAI has also worked with Microsoft to roll out ChatGPT-like technology across Microsoft\u2019s products. OpenAI and iPhone designer Jony Ive had also reportedly\u202fbeen in talks to raise $1 billion from Japanese conglomerate SoftBank for an AI device to replace the smartphone. \u2014 CNN\u2019s Juliana Liu and Diksha Madhok contributed reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_30_business_boeing-safety-plan-faa", "text": "Boeing executives presented sweeping changes to the company\u2019s production process and safety systems in a three-hour meeting with the Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday.\u00a0The plan is meant to reassure the public, airline customers and regulators that the troubled company\u2019s planes are safe to fly. \u201cThis is a guide for a new way for Boeing to do business,\u201d FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker said after the meeting. He said he expected the company to produce \u201csystemic change.\u201d Going forward, Boeing and FAA leaders said they will meet weekly on progress implementing the plan and the FAA will conduct monthly reviews. The plan includes several compo\ufeffnents to improve employee training, clarify instructions for assembly line employees, prevent suppliers from shipping defective components to Boeing and go through additional FAA audits, the agency said. The FAA had ordered outgoing Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun and his aides to develop the roadmap after two reviews in February found serious issues at the planemaker. The meeting included Calhoun and other leaders at the company, the FAA said. Whitaker said the meeting included an \u201cextensive PowerPoint presentation that broke the plan into components.\u201d Whitaker said he expects the company to build \u201crobust\u201d safety and quality management plans. He said the FAA will not allow Boeing to increase the number of planes coming off of its Max assembly line each month until it is satisfied on production quality. \u201cI don\u2019t think it will happen in the next few months,\u201d Whitaker said. He said Boeing has not asked the FAA to release it from the limits.\u00a0\u201cWe have not even had preliminary discussions on that point,\u201d he said. And Boeing\u2019s CFO was at an industry conference last week and signaled the company is nowhere close to being ready for increases. Whitaker said the FAA has changed the way it monitors work on the Boeing assembly line. \u201cWe\u2019ve changed that model,\u201d he said, from paperwork audits to inspectors on the assembly line. Whitaker said the FAA and Boeing will have \u201cconstant engagement,\u201d ranging from FAA inspectors on Boeing\u2019s factory floor daily to weekly senior meetings and quarter meetings between the CEO and FAA administrator. Boeing\u2019s planned fixes Work at Boeing has begun on its quality improvement plan, which includes hundreds of hours of new employee training and more time for managers to spend supervising production line work. The improvements include 7,500 new tools and equipment, 400 improved work instructions, and 300 hours of employee training material, the company said. Boeing says it is increasing employee coaching and eliminated some responsibilities so that managers can spend more time supervising employees on the factory floor. \u201cMany of these actions are underway and our team is committed to executing on each element of the plan,\u201d Calhoun said. His deputy who oversees the commercial airplane program, Stephanie Pope, urged employees in a company email today to \u201ccontinue to Speak Up\u201d on safety issues.\u00a0That company has said an earlier request for feedback drove a five-fold increase in reports, and some of those are reflected in the new plan. \u201cWe will succeed as a team and execute with safety, quality, and compliance in everything we do,\u201d wrote Pope, the CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes. Boeing says it will prevent safety lapses on its 737 assembly line by preventing planes under production from moving to the next station until all previous work is complete. The so-called \u201cMove Ready\u201d change is procedural but addresses an important concern of the Federal Aviation Administration:\u00a0That basic factory procedures were falling apart. The company has also identified the number of jobs left incomplete when a plane moves to the next station as one of six key numbers it will watch to determine if the remediation plan is working. The change is described in an 11-page executive summary of Boeing\u2019s plan to fix quality and safety issues that the company presented on Thursday to the Federal Aviation Administration. Turbulent year for Boeing Boeing has seen a string of bad news this year, from a mid-air fuselage blowout in January to probes from regulators to a report faulting Boeing for major quality issues. The new report is meant to show that the company \u2013 and Calhoun \u2013 can turn around what was once an international hallmark of manufacturing quality. Boeing\u2019s plan could also shed new light on the findings of FAA inspectors at Boeing\u2019s Renton, Washington, facility that builds the 737 Max, as well as the Wichita, Kansas, plant of key supplier Spirit AeroSystems. The FAA provided the findings to both companies but shielded the report from public view and has so far declined CNN requests for a copy. Neither the FAA nor Boeing has made public the actual plan.\u00a0Whitaker said the plan is Boeing\u2019s, and it can decide how to publicize it. The plan is seen as a crucial step to rebuilding the safety culture and practices of the nation\u2019s single largest exporter. Boeing has begun implementing changes within its production process that it says will produce safer airplanes. The changes include clearer instructions for the assembly line, training improvements and more tools.\u00a0The company says it has also ordered each station be completed before a plane moves on the assembly line and directed Spirit to not ship defective fuselages to Boeing\u2019s Renton plant. Whitaker ordered the plan from Boeing after reviewing the findings of FAA auditors who visited the company\u2019s 737 Max assembly line.\u00a0The auditors were deployed in response to the January 5 door plug blowout on Alaska Airlines flight 1282, a months-old Max.\u00a0The National Transportation Safety Board believes Boeing delivered the plane to the airline without critical bolts that hold the door plug in place, and Calhoun admitted to a \u201cquality escape.\u201d After the blowout, the FAA grounded Max 9s for three weeks and ordered inspections of each door plug. It was the second grounding since the first 737 Max delivery in 2017. The Max 8 spent 20 months grounded after crashes in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people. The plan may be one of Boeing\u2019s last major milestones under Calhoun, who announced in the wake of the blowout he would join other senior managers in leaving the company this year.\u00a0The corporate board has a search underway for a new chief executive. A previous safety culture review \u2013 including FAA and outside experts \u2013 was broader than the Max assembly line and found a \u201cdisconnect between Boeing\u2019s senior management and other members of the organization on safety culture.\u201d\u00a0The timing could not have been worse for the company:\u00a0The panel was wrapping up its work around the time of the door plug blowout and it landed on desks at the FAA at the same time as the initial production line audit results.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/business/boeing-safety-plan-faa/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_judges-stern-rebuke-of-elon-musks-x-gives-researchers-fresh-hope", "text": "A federal judge\u2019s decision this week reprimanding Elon Musk\u2019s X will have reverberating effects on efforts to hold influential online platforms accountable, legal experts and advocacy groups say. On Monday, District Judge Charles Breyer dismissed and excoriated a lawsuit by X against online watchdog group Center for Countering Digital Hate as an attempt to silence the non-profit group for sounding alarms about hate speech on the platform. Breyer wrote in Monday\u2019s order that the lawsuit was \u201cunabashedly\u201d about \u201cpunishing\u201d reports written by CCDH, which X had accused of campaigning to drive away its advertisers. Breyer held that the reports were \u201cunquestionably\u201d protected by the group\u2019s free speech rights. Now, that decision could embolden other research groups and Musk critics who have faced legal threats from the billionaire. The CCDH case \u2014 in the US District Court for the Northern District of California \u2014\u00a0has been widely viewed as a bellwether for research and accountability on X, where Musk has restored the accounts of previously banned White supremacists and spreaders of misinformation and where Musk himself has amplified various conspiracy theories. And CCDH is not the only organization that has faced attacks by self-proclaimed \u201cfree speech absolutist\u201d Musk after criticizing or raising concerns about his platform. \u201cThis is an important decision that sees Elon Musk\u2019s lawsuit for what it is \u2014 an effort to punish his critics for constitutionally protected speech and to deter researchers from studying his platform,\u201d said Alex Abdo, litigation director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, which had filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the case arguing that private companies should not be allowed to use breach of contract claims to punish criticism. \u201cSociety needs reliable and ethical research into social media platforms, and often that research relies on being able to study publicly available posts,\u201d Abdo said. X said it plans to appeal Breyer\u2019s decision. Musk\u2019s threats against X critics In his first year as owner of X, formerly known as Twitter, Musk threatened legal action against the Anti-Defamation League for defamation, as well as against Microsoft and Meta for allegedly improper data and trade secret access, respectively. None of those threats ever amounted to real lawsuits. He did, however, sue the progressive media watchdog Media Matters over its\u00a0analysis\u00a0highlighting antisemitic and pro-Nazi content on X, alleging that the group\u2019s testing methodology was not representative of how real users experience the site and that the report was designed to drive away advertisers. Legal experts have described that case as \u201cweak\u201d on the merits and as a \u201cbogus\u201d attempt to chill criticism of X. This week\u2019s court decision may be only a temporary setback in Musk\u2019s wider plan to stifle criticism, said Media Matters CEO Angelo Carusone. Musk\u2019s new playbook, Carusone said, enlists the help of sympathetic Republican attorneys general to investigate independent reporting organizations and tie them up in legal proceedings. The states of Texas and Missouri each announced probes into Media Matters following X\u2019s lawsuit against the group, to which Musk responded, \u201cGreat!\u201d As recently as Monday, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey filed a petition in state court seeking to compel Media Matters\u2019 cooperation with his investigation. The filing came a week after he appeared with Musk in a live event on X \u2014 which Carusone said shows how Musk hopes to deputize the power of government to silence his critics. \u201cThey have every reason to do it,\u201d Carusone said of the AGs\u2019 investigations. \u201cThey get the political benefits, they get the attention. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any cost to them yet. And if they are successful at developing this new playbook, this new terrain, legally, then it\u2019s going to pave the way for them to just use this tool and tactic over and over and over again.\u201d A representative for X did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Carusone\u2019s claims. Researchers face hurdles to studying on-platform behavior Researchers from non-profits and academic institutions have had a harder time studying X since Musk\u2019s takeover in 2022. Academics need large samples of posts, shares, likes and other data to study social media trends in mis- and disinformation, public health, elections and other key topics. But one of Musk\u2019s first changes at X was to put access to platform data behind a steep paywall. Researchers and civil society groups said the new subscription fees \u2014 costing up to $2.5 million a year \u2014\u00a0were \u201coutrageously expensive\u201d and made it impossible to do their work, reducing transparency of a critical platform. The change may have forced some researchers to rely more heavily on first-person observational data to draw conclusions about user behavior on X. Groups like CCDH have also used automated \u201cscraping\u201d of publicly viewable content from X rather than paying the company for data directly, a tactic that helped give rise to X\u2019s initial lawsuit. Efforts by X and other social media companies to limit research transparency makes them less accountable to the public at best and, at worst, could mask malicious behavior, said David Karpf, an associate professor in the School of Media and Public Affairs at George Washington University. \u201cWe need independent research to have any real measure of what\u2019s going on at X/Twitter. Musk is only ever going to release data that makes his company look good,\u201d Karpf said. \u201cThese platforms are too big and too vital to the spread of information to be left unmonitored.\u201d \u201cThis is an election year,\u201d Karpf added, \u201cand the platforms are taking steps to make it harder to monitor how their services are used for malignant ends.\u201d Free Press, another media accountability organization that has been critical of Musk\u2019s leadership of X and which called for advertisers to pause their spending on the platform shortly after his takeover, also celebrated Breyer\u2019s ruling as potentially removing at least one hurdle that watchdog organizations face. \u201cThe guardrails for democracy are hanging by a thread and we have dwindling insights into platform practices as researchers face lawsuits, congressional subpoenas and other scare tactics,\u201d said Nora Benavidez, senior counsel and director of digital rights at Free Press. Ultimately, Benavidez called the ruling \u201ca reminder that platform accountability is essential and will inevitably prevail when up against bullies like Musk who try to silence us.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/judges-stern-rebuke-of-elon-musks-x-gives-researchers-fresh-hope/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "business"}}

OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, with an explicit mission to harness what may soon be superhuman intelligence \u201cto benefit humanity as a whole.\u201d But that sensibility hasn\u2019t lasted. The company now has a multi-billion-dollar for-profit arm. They have been developing new technologies at lightning speed, and sometimes sending them out to the public\u00a0before some employees believed they were ready. The company has already reportedly invented an AI technology so dangerous they will never release it \u2013 but they also\u00a0won\u2019t tell\u00a0reporters or the public exactly what it is. This dynamic \u2013 a potentially dangerous technology developed at extreme speed, largely behind closed doors \u2013 is partly to blame for Altman\u2019s firing. The OpenAI board, according to\u00a0CNN\u2019s David Goldman, worried that \u201cthe company was making the technological equivalent of a nuclear bomb, and its caretaker, Sam Altman, was moving so fast that he risked a global catastrophe.\u201d At particular issue seemed to be Altman\u2019s efforts to make the tools behind ChatGPT available to anyone who wanted to make their own version of the chatbot. This could be widely disastrous, some board members worried. But then they fired him without warning, and apparently without involving Microsoft, the company\u2019s largest shareholder. Now, Altman is at the new AI group at Microsoft, and one has to wonder if the oversight and caution there will be on par with that at OpenAI, or if he\u2019ll be handed carte blanche to push as fast and hard as he wants. And for all the justified reticence of the OpenAI board, the company has carried out much of its work in secrecy \u2013 without the public really understanding what a handful of unaccountable technologists are building, and how it is nearly guaranteed to indelibly change their lives. AI is broadly understood to have the potential to reshape vast swaths of human existence. At the very least, it seems nearly guaranteed to change how we process information, how we communicate, how we learn and how we work (and if we work). And the ramifications could be much more extreme. AI technologies have already demonstrated the ability\u00a0to lie and to cover their tracks. They have already been able to\u00a0suggest the design\u00a0to make a virus spread more quickly. Many researchers\u00a0acutely understand\u00a0just how quickly these machines could develop the capacity to annihilate us, including Altman: He has a prepper\u2019s paradise prepared in Big Sur, complete with guns and \u201cgas masks from the Israeli Defense Force\u201d in case AI goes off the rails and the robots go to war against humans,\u00a0according to reporting in the New Yorker. But don\u2019t worry, he told an Atlantic reporter: If AI is determined to wipe us out, \u201cno gas mask is helping anyone.\u201d (If you want an excellent and terrifying rundown of AI\u2019s risks \u2013 at least those we understand right now, which are almost certainly a mere sliver of the looming perils \u2013\u00a0the Atlantic profile of Altman and his technology\u00a0is worth a read). AI is very exciting technology. But it is also a potentially very dangerous one, and not in the social media sense of \u201cit may give us bad self-esteem and make us lonelier\u201d but in the sense of \u201cit could break down human societies and kill us all.\u201d Given the life-altering potential of AI \u2013 that even if it doesn\u2019t kill us all, it will almost certainly change human existence in unprecedented ways at unprecedented speed \u2013 we all have a stake in how it\u2019s being developed. And yet the development is being left to a handful of people (who seem to be\u00a0largely\u00a0men) in Silicon Valley, and other tech pockets around the globe. And we all have a stake in whose interests AI will serve \u2013 and right now, its development is being funded with billions of dollars by people expecting to make a huge profit. Do the interests of the public align with the interests of the shareholders to whom profit-driven, potentially tremendously lucrative-for-a-few companies are beholden? Or with the interests of tech entrepreneurs who are primarily excited about being at the forefront of the AI revolution, regardless of the potential human costs? One thing is clear: AI is coming. And how it is built and unleashed on the public matters more than perhaps any technology of the past century. It is, indeed, up there with the atom bomb in its destructive potential \u2013 except likely more difficult to regulate and control. \u201cRegulation\u201d does not begin to scratch the surface of what\u2019s needed to make sure that the AI future is not a catastrophic one, especially since the development of AI is now a massive international arms race, with particularly horrific implications if bad actors develop this technology first. But regulation is, at minimum, a necessary step. So is transparency: In the US, companies have wide leverage to work behind a veil of secrecy, and much of what AI companies do is kept secret to stymy competition. But the public certainly has a right to understand what life-altering technologies are set to be inflicted upon us, and what the creators are doing to protect humanity \u2013 our jobs, our communities, our families, our connections, our educations and our abilities to build a life of purpose, but also our lives and our safety. The Altman story is fascinating because Altman is the most powerful figure in AI technology, which in effect makes him one of the most powerful men in the world. But that should give us pause: Who is he, what power does he hold, what is he doing with it, who does he answer to, and are we comfortable with this much life-altering potential being held by a few unaccountable people?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/21/opinions/sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_30_tech_elon-musk-donald-trump", "text": "Elon Musk has sought to accumulate political capital commensurate with his extravagant wealth. In the past year, Musk has publicly opined on global conflicts, met with numerous world leaders and US senators to discuss artificial intelligence and his space and satellite technologies. And he has courted senior Chinese officials on their home turf. Now he is reportedly exploring what could be his next political project: Becoming an adviser to Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, according to a report from the Wall Street Journal. Musk has discussed advising Trump should he win the 2024 election, the Journal reported, citing unnamed sources. Musk called Trump directly via cellphone to explore a role that could potentially give Musk significant influence over US policies. It\u2019s not clear based on the Journal\u2019s reporting which party initiated conversations about the potential role. The Trump campaign did not respond to CNN\u2019s requests for comment; Musk also did not respond to the Wall Street Journal, but Brian Hughes, a Trump campaign spokesperson, told the outlet: \u201cPresident Trump will be the only voice of what role an individual plays in his presidency.\u201d Musk pushed back on the Journal report in a post on X Thursday, saying: \u201cThere have not been any discussions of a role for me in a potential Trump Presidency.\u201d However, a potential role in a future Trump administration could expand upon the role that Musk played in the previous Trump administration, when he served on two business advisory councils before quitting them over Trump\u2019s decision to pull out of the Paris climate agreement. The privilege of whispering in Trump\u2019s ear, should he win reelection, could give the billionaire \u2013 who is increasingly steeped in the rhetoric and imagery of the conservative culture wars \u2013 even more power on the global stage. Reporting that Musk and Trump\u2019s relationship has improved comes after Musk\u2019s politics have become more aligned with Trump\u2019s. Musk has made supporting right-wing causes \u2014 and extremism, in some situations \u2014 increasingly central to his identity. He has vocally opposed Covid-19 lockdowns and embraced anti-vaccine ideology. He has elevated conservative speech on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter that he purchased in 2022. And he has pushed racist conspiracy theories about immigration. Musk has also obsessed over the \u201cwoke mind virus,\u201d a term used by some conservatives to describe progressive causes. And he has explicitly called for Republican victories at the ballot box, warning of the country\u2019s impending \u201cdoom\u201d if a \u201cred wave\u201d does not materialize in November. A more formal alliance with Trump would mark the culmination of Musk\u2019s long, winding quest for political relevance \u2014 and could greatly benefit his empire of companies that depend on government support. \u2018A blatant conflict of interest\u2019 Musk\u2019s various businesses, most notably SpaceX and Tesla, benefit from direct government contracts and federal subsidies. Their fortunes can rise or fall based on US policies governing energy, electric vehicles and the economy writ large. For Musk to have a direct, private line to a future President Trump \u201cwould seem to be a blatant conflict of interest,\u201d said Darrell West, a senior fellow in the governance studies program at the Brookings Institution. The US government routinely solicits feedback from the private sector, and presidents have in the past solicited advice from CEOs and even appointed business leaders to cabinet-level positions. But those are official roles that require government officials to put their holdings in blind trusts. Less official roles for business leaders are often organized through councils such as the ones Musk participated in previously. In those advisory councils, dozens of stakeholders are invited to weigh in; they frequently involve competitors or rivals and the proceedings are relatively transparent, West said. Musk\u2019s potential arrangement with Trump could be problematic because of the combination of personal business interests with exclusive access, where the influence could be boundless and immune to any scrutiny, West added. Additionally, Musk and his companies are currently the target of multiple federal investigations \u2014 by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Justice Department, to name a few. Musk and his companies have repeatedly gone to court to challenge aspects of those probes, but they have largely been rebuffed. It would be egregious if Trump intervened to halt or delay any of these investigations, but even the perception of improper influence would be highly damaging, West said. \u201cIt destroys the rule of law if a businessperson can cut a deal with a president to protect his own business interests,\u201d West said. \u201cThe whole point of capitalism is fair play and people not having special advantages, and there\u2019s a risk that we lose that benefit.\u201d Meanwhile, Musk\u2019s views on social issues may not necessarily sway Trump in a different direction, given how much they seem to overlap, but the billionaire\u2019s penchant for extreme rhetoric could give Trump political cover for controversial action as president. Under Musk, a rightward shift at X Musk\u2019s management of Twitter \u2014 now known as X \u2014 reflects his own lurch to the right. One of Musk\u2019s first moves after buying Twitter in 2022 was to reinstate Donald Trump\u2019s account, after the former president was suspended for incitement following the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. Since then, Musk has stopped short of using his widely followed X account to endorse a specific US presidential candidate and said in a March post that he didn\u2019t plan to donate money to \u201ceither candidate for US President.\u201d But he has repeatedly criticized Biden. This week, he has routinely railed against his policies on the US-Mexico border and immigration. The billionaire has used his platform to elevate right-leaning political candidates, including hosting the presidential campaign launch for Republican Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who later dropped out of the race, as well as a livestream discussion with third-party hopeful Robert Kennedy, Jr. Musk has also repeatedly amplified on X fringe conspiracy theories popular in extreme right-wing spaces online, including a baseless claim about the attack on Paul Pelosi, the anti-Hillary Clinton conspiracy theory known as \u201cPizzagate,\u201d and an antisemitic conspiracy theory often espoused by hate groups (the latter of which Musk later apologized for). His own posts aside, many of Musk\u2019s changes to X have also contributed to a rightward shift in the platform\u2019s culture. He reinstated the suspended accounts of White supremacists and conspiracy theorists, saying at the time he was responding to the wishes of platform users who expressed their opinions through an unscientific poll Musk posted from his account. X also made it easier for politicians and political candidates to qualify for newsworthiness exemptions from Twitter\u2019s rules, when they would otherwise have had their content restricted or removed. Under Musk\u2019s leadership, X allowed users to purchase blue \u201cverification\u201d checkmarks, adjusted its algorithm to boost the posts of those subscribers and began paying verified users a portion of the ad revenue their posts generate based on their popularity. Many of the users willing to spend $8 per month for a checkmark are those who are ideologically aligned with the billionaire \u2013 whose views are now elevated on the platform. In some cases, the policy shift appears to incentivize problematic behavior: the more extreme or outlandish a post is, the more likely it is to generate significant engagement and therefore the more likely the poster is to receive meaningful ad revenue share dollars if they\u2019ve paid for a blue check. Musk\u2019s changes to X have helped \u201cthe growing normalization of hate and lies which can only be damaging to democracies that are based on compromise, tolerance, science, and truth,\u201d said Imran Ahmed, CEO of the online watchdog Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH). X sued CCDH last year for allegedly trying to drive away advertisers by publishing reports critical of the platform\u2019s response to hateful content; CCDH won in March, when a federal judge threw out the case and excoriated X for trying to silence the group under a mountain of litigation. Biden aides told Politico last year that the President\u2019s campaign viewed X as an increasingly hostile platform, although there were no plans to stop posting there. The Biden campaign on Thursday lashed out at the idea of Musk and Trump working together. \u201cDespite what Donald Trump thinks, America is not for sale to billionaires, oil and gas executives, or even Elon Musk,\u201d Biden-Harris 2024 spokesperson James Singer said in a statement. \u201cTrump is selling out America to pay his legal bills and put himself in power, while all billionaires like Elon see is a sucker: They know if they cut him campaign checks, he\u2019ll cut their taxes while he cuts Social Security and other benefits for the middle class.\u201d \u2013 CNN\u2019s Donie O\u2019Sullivan contributed to this report.\u00a0", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/tech/elon-musk-donald-trump/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_30_economy_us-economic-data-report-inflation", "text": "US economic data released Thursday was broadly disappointing. America\u2019s economy expanded at a weaker pace earlier this year than initially reported. The decline in home sales based on contract signings last month was much steeper than economists expected. And mortgage rates inched higher this week, thrusting the average rate back above the psychological 7% threshold. Treasury yields slipped after the release of the government\u2019s latest measure of economic growth in the first quarter, which also showed that consumer spending was softer than previously estimated. The benchmark 10-year US Treasury yield slid below 4.6%. Thursday\u2019s batch of economic figures shows that the economy isn\u2019t heating back up and has instead struggled under the weight of the highest interest rates in more than two decades. And while Thursday\u2019s indicators point to some economic pressure being felt by American consumers, it also bodes well for an eventual lowering of high borrowing costs. This silver lining is especially important after the slowdown in inflation stalled in the first quarter. Signs of inflation being stuck raised fears that the Federal Reserve could hike rates again this year or not cut them at all. Now, the possibility of rate cuts happening sometime in 2024 is back in the conversation. And\u00a0the\u00a0latest GDP data also showed that inflation in the first quarter was revised lower, including a measure that excludes volatile food and energy prices. That also helps strengthen the case for rate cuts. \u201cMonthly data beyond March generally point to a continued, albeit gently cooling, economic expansion,\u201d Oren Klachkin, financial markets economist at Nationwide, said in a note Thursday. \u201cSome warning signs regarding the economic outlook are visible beneath the surface, but nothing that makes us pessimistic about the road ahead.\u201d Economic growth The Commerce Department\u2019s second estimate of first-quarter gross domestic product, which measures all the services and goods produced in the economy, registered at a 1.3% annualized rate, down from the 1.6% reflected in the first estimate. That was largely due to a downward revision to consumer spending, which accounts for about 70% of the US economy. Spending advanced 2% in the January-through-March period, compared to the initial rate of 2.5%. The latest GDP report also showed that corporate profits, before taxes, fell 0.6% in the first quarter, the first decline in a year and down sharply from the 4.1% increase in the prior three-month period. Still, while most corporate earnings results this quarter proved decent, companies indicated it\u2019s become increasingly difficult for them to pass on costs to consumers. Housing Housing data released Thursday mostly showed that the market remains tough, especially for first-time buyers. The standard 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 7.02% this week, up slightly from last week\u2019s average of 6.94%, according to Freddie Mac data. Mortgage rates are higher than anything seen in the decade leading up to 2022, when the Fed began to hike rates in a bid to tame inflation. They\u2019re not expected to fall meaningfully anytime this year because inflation is still stubbornly elevated. So long as this remains the case, the Fed isn\u2019t likely to reduce rates by much in 2024 \u2014 at least not enough to give Americans a break. The Fed doesn\u2019t directly set mortgage rates, but its actions, which influence yields, do. Mortgage rates track the 10-year yield. Pending home sales slumped 7.7% in April to a reading of 72.3, the lowest level in four years, according to data from the National Association of Realtors released Thursday. Despite some welcome improvement in housing supply over the past few months, tough borrowing costs are spooking buyers and keeping the country\u2019s housing market frozen. \u201cThe impact of escalating interest rates throughout April dampened home buying, even with more inventory in the market,\u201d Lawrence Yun, NAR\u2019s chief economist, said in a statement. \u201cBut the Federal Reserve\u2019s anticipated rate cut later this year should lead to better conditions, with improved affordability and more supply.\u201d Jobs Weekly data on applications for jobless benefits, released every Thursday and often seen as the earliest sign of any shift in the job market, hasn\u2019t been concerning, but they\u2019ve been trending higher over the past few weeks. There were 219,000 first-time claims filed during the week ended May 25, according to Labor Department data released Thursday. Last week\u2019s filings were up by 3,000 from the upwardly revised tally the week before but were mostly in line with economists\u2019 forecasts. Economists were expecting 218,000 initial claims, according to FactSet consensus estimates. Continuing claims ticked higher by 4,000 to 1.791 million for the week ended May 18. The four-week average of 222,500 is the highest since mid-September of last year. Weekly jobless claims data, considered a proxy for layoff activity, can be highly volatile and is frequently revised. The Dow closed 331 points lower, or 0.9%. The S&P 500 was down 0.6% and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.1% Thursday.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/economy/us-economic-data-report-inflation/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "business"}}

However, it\u2019s clear that there is something different about Dex; she\u2019s an entirely virtual \u201cdigital human,\u201d designed by a startup in the UK. For her performances, Dex is displayed on a video screen or as a holographic projection, with her mixes created by humans. She is animated using Unreal Engine \u2014 a 3D modeling software widely used in video games \u2014 combined with motion-capture. Generative artificial intelligence allows her to remember information and respond to questions, using a voice also generated by AI. \u201cShe\u2019s probably one of the only digital humans in the performance space that you can have a conversation and interact with,\u201d says Denise Harris, CCO of startup Sum Vivas. \u201cYou can ask her anything. She is a genius about music.\u201d Last month, Dex performed at Digital Fashion Weeks in New York, Paris and Milan, and she has modeled outfits by Prada and Louis Vuitton at digital fashion events. For Liverpool-based Sum Vivas she\u2019s a \u201cshowpiece\u201d for more practical applications. The company is now developing digital humans that can \u201clisten\u201d to people\u2019s questions and converse in real time. \u201cShellie\u201d can provide product information as an avatar on company websites, while \u201cArif\u201d is set to direct passengers and answer questions as a multilingual concierge on screens at airports. According to CEO and founder Rob Sims, digital humans can help bridge the gap between AI technology and people. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve found is when people start working with and conversing with a digital human, they very quickly suspend disbelief,\u201d Sims tells CNN. \u201cIt becomes natural.\u201d AI explosion Since OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT was launched in November 2022, considerable hype has surrounded the potential of generative AI \u2014 artificial intelligence powered by huge datasets of information, capable of generating text outputs in a conversational way. Record levels of investment into generative AI have followed, with over $21 billion poured into the industry during the first nine months of last year, according to data insights company Pitchbook. In March 2023, Google launched Bard (recently renamed Gemini) and around the same time Anthropic released its AI assistant Claude. As generative AI chatbots become increasingly ubiquitous, Sum Vivas is one of several companies looking to make them more human. US and New Zealand-based UneeQ has developed animated conversational \u201cdigital humans\u201d that can be used as virtual sales reps and customer service agents on company websites, and this month it debuted Sama 2.0, an animated cabin crew member that answers questions on Qatar Airways\u2019 website and app. Microsoft recently announced that users of its Azure software would be able to create lifelike avatars capable of turning text prompts into animated speech. However, there are widespread concerns about the impact AI could have on the job market.  \u201cWhen we rely on automated tools, what skills are we losing in the process?\u201d asks Jennifer Ding, senior researcher at the Alan Turing Institute, the UK\u2019s national institute for data science and artificial intelligence. \u201cIn some ways, we think of AI as something that\u2019s helping us or augmenting our work,\u201d she says. \u201cHowever, alongside, this fear of replacement is bubbling up more and more.\u201d Harris, however, points to new opportunities within digital human design and development. \u201cEvery scenario that we found, we\u2019re creating jobs and working in harmony with people rather than taking away jobs,\u201d she says. \u201cDigital humans, first and foremost, should work with other human colleagues,\u201d adds Sims. \u201cWe\u2019ll move into a stage where digital humans will start to become just another member of the team, with added benefits for that team, and obviously the customers they serve.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/business/digital-humans-ai-dj-dex-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_26_business_tennis-popularity-zendaya-challengers", "text": "It\u2019s not Zendaya\u2019s fault you can\u2019t stop thinking about tennis. Her magnetic performance in \u201cChallengers,\u201d a movie about a m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois that happens to have tennis in the background, might seem to have thrust the sport into the spotlight, but it\u2019s becoming more popular in the past few years that it\u2019s hard to escape. The sport is surging on a global scale, with its biggest names fronting luxe fashion campaigns from Louis Vuitton to Loewe and stars gracing the cover of Vogue. Of course, there\u2019s a TikTok angle, with the rise of #tenniscore videos garnering tens of millions of views, and yes, even that buzzy film, which was number one at the box office in its debut weekend. In a world of megawatt sports stars, ESPN went with tennis and chose 23-time grand slam winner Serena Williams to host this year\u2019s ESPY Awards, airing on ABC in July, perhaps as a testament that the sport is actually a draw again. Tennis had its heydey in the 1970s and 80s but a resurgence began at the height of Covid-19 when it was one of the few activities people could play safely while socially distanced. Its popularity has only grown since, as there\u2019s a changing of the guard among the top-ranked players that it\u2019s attracting new eyes and corporate interests, like fashion and Hollywood, fueling a boon. Not only are people just watching it, they\u2019re actually hitting the courts: The United States Tennis Association (USTA) said that nearly 24 million people are currently playing tennis, marking four consecutive years of growth. Brands are serving The money is following: In the past year, the number of sponsorships jumped 41% and the number of brands advertising in tennis soared 40%, according to SponsorUnited, a sports and entertainment research platform,\u00a0growing faster than many other sports including MLB, MLS and the NBA. That\u2019s the result of a \u201cconvergence of a few important factors,\u201d according to Bob Lynch, CEO of SponsorUnited, including rising TV ratings for the Tennis Channel and major tournaments, the docuseries \u201cBreak Point\u201d that had a two-season run on Netflix plus the growth of tennis players\u2019 social media accounts. Tennis is one the rare sports that plays nearly year-round with weekly tournaments across the world, so it \u201cattracts a diverse, global and localized fan base, which gives brands the ability to target very specific audiences for specific reasons,\u201d Lynch told CNN. Want to promote Swiss tourism around the world? The country tapped its greatest tennis export Roger Federer to star in a campaign for just that, with one viral ad starring Anne Hathaway that garnered more than 100 million views on YouTube. Or want to advertise to an affluent audience? That explains all the banking logos surrounding the courts at Roland Garros in Paris. Tennis is also going through a change of guard, especially on the men\u2019s side with Rafael Nadal likely playing his final season and Novak Djokovic, who is still the world\u2019s no. 1 men\u2019s player, lately struggling. Popular players on the woman\u2019s tour such as the Williams sisters have either retired, struggled with injuries or have taken a maternity leave such as former no. 1 Naomi Osaka. That\u2019s prompted an opening for many players, especially younger ones, including 2023 Wimbledon winner Carlos Alcaraz, who is just 21 years old, and Iga \u015awi\u0105tek, the 22-year-old from Poland who has already won four grand slam titles, to become global superstars. \u201cDigitally native and content savvy younger players like Coco Gauff are becoming more prominent,\u201d Lynch said. \u201cFans have more access to tennis athletes and their lives, interests and journeys than ever before due to the increased social exposure they receive, which allows them to become more influential to fans and brands alike.\u201d A scroll through Gauff\u2019s Instagram page, where the 2023 US Open women\u2019s final winner has nearly 2 million followers, shows her various sponsors mixed with photos from her personal life. Posts on her feed range from Barilla (the pasta maker signed her in 2019 to include its logo on her clothing), to speaking about how technology helps her practice in a Microsoft ad. How players cash in Another brand featured heavily on Gauff\u2019s Instagram is New Balance, her official on-court outfitter that signed her when she was just 14 years old, which has since expanded to include a lineup of shoes that the 20-year-old helps design. When Gauff won her first Grand Slam title last year, not only was she wearing a New Balance outfit designed for the US Open, but after winning, she donned a \u201cCall Me Coco Champion\u201d T-shirt that sold out within a few hours. Although she\u2019s the brand\u2019s biggest player, she\u2019s also part of a select few athletes that the privately owned apparel maker has deals with, trailing bigger outfitters such as Nike and Adidas. \u201cWe say no a lot,\u201d admits Evan Zeder, director of global sports marketing for New Balance\u2019s tennis and baseball units. \u201cWe\u2019re not looking to just sign a bunch of athletes to have a bunch of athletes.\u201d Its players, which also includes no. 14 men\u2019s player Tommy Paul, get various forms of payment including retainers and bonuses from New Balance and clothes and footwear to wear on and off the court. Tennis is different because the athlete is wearing the brand head to toe and is the center of attention since it\u2019s largely a solo sport. Choosing a tennis player to sponsor takes trust on both sides, with New Balance having to prove that its clothes and shoes perform \u201con the highest levels of the sport\u201d and avoid a public relations nightmare currently happening in baseball, but it\u2019s \u201cultimately waiting for the right opportunities for the brand,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cThe opportunity for us to story tell with the athletes is more unique than any other sport out there because they\u2019re not wearing a team or jersey, they\u2019re wearing New Balance,\u201d he said. Fashion on the forefront While New Balance is a relatively new clothier to enter the sport, others have been involved for decades. Lacoste, the French luxury brand, was born with tennis in mind since its start in 1933. After all, founder Ren\u00e9 Lacoste created the \u201cpolo shirt\u201d that was made for tennis. \u201cLacoste\u00a0undoubtedly benefits from the greatest legitimacy in this universe thanks to its sporting roots, particularly in tennis,\u201d said Lacoste\u2019s Deputy CEO Catherine Spindler. The crocodile-adorned brand has two of the biggest names in tennis who faced off against each other in the 2023 US Open men\u2019s final: Djokovic and Daniil Medvedev, with the former easily winning. Lacoste\u2019s polo shirts have become a major part of the \u201ctennis aesthetic,\u201d or the luxury athleticism #tenniscore trending on social media. That\u2019s perhaps not a surprise to Spindler because the sport \u201chas always been associated with elegance, including from a sartorial point of view.\u201d \u201cRecently, the influence of tennis on fashion has strengthened even further, and many are adopting the codes of this sport,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cPieces from the tennis universe are highly praised and serve as sources of inspiration for everyone.\u201d Zendaya recently wore a custom-made Lacoste silhouette ensemble for her \u201cChallengers\u201d press stop in Australia, which is \u201cfurther proof of the inspiration generated by tennis,\u201d Spindler said. Big business for booze Tennis has not only raised the profile for clothing, but it\u2019s a magnet for premium spirit brands too. The Australian Open serves up the Aperol Spritz. Roland Garros in Paris, which starts Sunday, has its Mo\u00ebt & Chandon champagne and no visit to Wimbledon, near London, is complete without a Pimm\u2019s. However, arguably the most popular cocktail in tennis is at the US Open: the Honey Deuce. The $22 drink mixes Grey Goose vodka, lemonade and Chambord and is topped with a honeydew melon ball. In 2023, a record-breaking 450,000 of these drinks were sold. Alcohol brands trying to crack the US market see the growing popularity of tennis as an opportunity to introduce themselves to drinkers. Take Maestro Dobel, a tequila brand sold in the US since 2008 but overshadowed by its celebrity-backed competitors. Dobel became the US Open\u2019s official tequila sponsor last year, bringing alongs its Ace Paloma cocktail that it sells at other tennis tournaments it sponsors. But the brand\u2019s attraction to tennis \u201cwasn\u2019t something that happened overnight,\u201d said Lander Otegui, the chief marketing officer for Proximo, noting that the brand has sponsored tournaments in Mexico for more than a decade. Dobel, in recent years, expanded north to become sponsors of elite-level tournaments in Miami, Indian Wells and Cincinnati \u2014 all places where Otegui said Dobel sees an \u201cuptick\u201d in sales following the tournament. The fans that tennis attracts are \u201cpretty wide\u201d in regards to ages but the affluent audience that frequent the events \u201cgoes hand-and-hand with the brand,\u201d Otegui said. Otegui declined to reveal specific financial numbers on sponsoring a tournament, but said it\u2019s a \u201cmulti-million dollar investment\u201d that involves paying a hefty fee and additional money for displays and, at the US Open, a starry suite. Last year, it had a suite at Arthur Ashe Stadium, the US Open\u2019s biggest court, where it attracted A-list stars like Charlize Theron and Katie Holmes, which in return, gave the brand even more publicity. \u201cIt\u2019s been an incredible time for tennis in the last few years, and with record attendance\u00a0for pretty much every event in the US and globally,\u201d he said. \u201cThe sport is in a really good place and it\u2019s also helped us solidify\u00a0our presence in it.\u201d As for the future, growth won\u2019t fault if the USTA has its way: The organization wants to grow the number of people playing to 35 million, or 10% of the US population, within the next decade.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/26/business/tennis-popularity-zendaya-challengers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2022_04_25_business_electric-hybrid-corvette", "text": "General Motors will produce a fully electric Chevrolet Corvette, GM President Mark Reuss announced in a LinkedIn post Monday morning.  Reuss didn\u2019t say when the electric Corvette would come, but he hinted that a hybrid model could come relatively soon. \u201cWe will offer an electrified Corvette as early as next year,\u201d he wrote. An accompanying video the company posted to Twitter showed what appeared to be a hybrid Corvette, and in another first, showed the front wheels spinning and throwing snow as if being powered. All Corvettes produced by the company previously have been rear-wheel-drive only. While Reuss\u2019s post implies a hybrid Corvette will be based on the current generation of the car, it\u2019s not clear if the all-electric version will be a variation of this car or a completely different future model. \u201cElectrified\u201d is an auto industry term encompassing everything from hybrid to fully electric vehicles, and anything with an electric motor can count as \u201celectrified.\u201d It has long been rumored that the current generation of the Corvette, the first with its gasoline engine mounted behind the seats instead of in the front, could be built with a hybrid system. Reuss has also previously hinted there would be electrified variants of the car. Various companies are working on electric sports cars. Most all-electric vehicles in production so far have been four-door sedans and SUVs, as the need for batteries lends itself to larger and heavier vehicles. Tesla\u2019s first car, the Lotus Elise-based Tesla Roadster, was an electric sports car, but the second-generation of Tesla Roadster, originally unveiled as a prototype in 2017, has yet to go into production. Some manufacturers, such as Lamborghini, have said that current battery technology doesn\u2019t allow for a optimum sports car performance from a purely electric vehicle. Lamborghini has been working on plug-in hybrid sports cars, though. To date, the Corvette is only available in the base Stingray version with 6.2-liter V8 engine producing up to 495 horsepower. A 670 horsepower Corvette Z06 with a 5.5-liter V8 was unveiled last fall. The previous generation of the Corvette included included a 755-horsepower ZR1 version. Nothing like that has yet been announced for the current model but GM engineers have said a major reason for putting the engine in the back was to allow for better performance at extremely high horsepower levels. Besides saving gas, hybrid systems can also be used in high-performance cars to add additional power and to provide for quicker acceleration since electric motors can provide power to the wheels more quickly than gas engines. Ferrari\u2019s most powerful sports cars are hybrids, for instance.   GM has said it plans to produce only zero-emission vehicles, meaning fully electric or powered by hydrogen fuel cells, by 2035.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/25/business/electric-hybrid-corvette/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "business"}}

The S&P 500 was down 0.6% and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.1% as lackluster earnings results from Salesforce (CRM) worried investors. Shares of the customer relationship management company fell 19.7% after it reported a revenue miss and lowered expectations for the year ahead, notching its worst day in two decades. That comes after a bad Wednesday for the broader market, with all 11 sectors of the S&P 500 closing lower. The Dow fell by more than 300 points, driven largely by a tick down of shares of chipmaking giant Nvidia (NVDA), pulling large tech stocks down along with it. This week\u2019s downturn has been fueled by a range of factors, including earnings and stronger-than-expected economic data. Bonds have taken a particular hit as concerns about inflation mount and after a weak Treasury auction on Wednesday. The 10-year Treasury yield climbed to its highest level since late April. Robust economic data has also spooked investors, who worry that signs of a stronger economy could push the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates higher for longer as it battles to bring down inflation. The S&P 500 has finished higher for 23 of the last 30 weeks, marking a joint record since 1989, but it\u2019s now tracking toward a negative week. \u201cThere had already been a relentless run of gains in recent weeks that was always going to be tough to maintain,\u201d wrote Deutsche Bank analysts on Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that the momentum is now more negative.\u201d New economic data on Thursday showed that US gross domestic product in the first quarter was revised lower (1.3% from 1.6%) and that personal consumption is slowing.

{"id": "2024_05_30_cars_catalytic-converter-theft-stealing-auto", "text": "Johnny Wactor, an actor who formerly starred in \u201cGeneral Hospital,\u201d caught people in the act of stealing the catalytic converter from his car Saturday. Tragically, one of the thieves, according to witnesses and Los Angeles police, then shot and killed Wactor. It\u2019s rare for someone to be murdered over a catalytic converter but thefts of this car part remain stunningly frequent. Last year, thieves stole 27,609 catalytic converters in the US, with more than half of those thefts happening in California, according to the National Insurance Crime Bureau. That\u2019s down sharply from the more than 64,700 that were stolen in 2022. But, up to last year, catalytic converter thefts had been rising sharply, up by a factor of four, since 2020. It might seem odd that this particular car part would attract so much criminal attention, especially one with such an innocuous purpose. A catalytic converter cleans a car\u2019s exhaust, making the air safer to breathe for all of us. On its website, the US Environmental Protection Agency has called the catalytic converter \u201cone of the great environmental inventions of all time.\u201d But it\u2019s not what the catalytic converter does that attracts desperate criminals. It\u2019s what\u2019s inside. Often, there\u2019s platinum, worth more than $1,000 an ounce, palladium, worth nearly as much, and rhodium, worth almost $5,000 per ounce. They react chemically with exhaust gases, breaking down compounds like carbon monoxide, nitrous oxides and small amounts of unburned fuel into less harmful substances. A catalytic converter is a metal cylinder or flattened oval that\u2019s part of the car\u2019s exhaust system. It\u2019s usually underneath the car with an exhaust pipe running in one end and out the other. Inside is a honeycomb-like structure coated in metals far more valuable than gold. Easy to steal Those metals, plus the catalytic converter\u2019s exposed position, make it a target for theft. Also, unlike some other car parts, catalytic converters are usually not marked with a vehicle identification number, making it difficult to track a stolen converter back to an actual theft. Unlike with other car parts that are under the hood, locking a car won\u2019t necessarily deter a catalytic converter thief who can crawl underneath the car and saw through the exhaust pipe. The popularity of SUVs, which are higher off the ground, has made the job even easier. But while those prices sound astoundingly high, they\u2019re actually much lower than they\u2019ve been in recent years. A couple of years ago, rhodium was worth almost $30,000 an ounce. That, plus increased law enforcement around these thefts and higher penalties for those who steal convertors or purchase stolen ones, contributed to recent declines in thefts, according the NICB. Also, as car engines have becoming more efficient and cleaner-burning, catalytic converters have been made smaller and with less metal, said Richard Waitas, a senior manager at the exhaust components company MagnaFlow. There simply isn\u2019t as much dirty exhaust gas they need to clean and this is one reason thieves may target older models. Limiting thefts Some newer cars have at least one catalytic converter \u2013 vehicles can have more than one \u2013 close to the engine where it works more efficiently because it stays hotter, said Waitas. That\u2019s also helped deter some theft because the converter is just harder to reach up close to the engine block. Federal legislation that is currently being considered would require catalytic converters to be marked with identifying numbers so stolen converters could be tracked back to specific cars, making the crime easier to prosecute. The National Automobile Dealers Association is actively pushing for the new law, the Preventing Auto Recycling Theft (PART)\u00a0act, a spokesperson said. Used catalytic converters can sell for anywhere from $25 to $1,000, depending on the metals content, which varies by a vehicles make and model, according to Scott Vollero and Christopher Gaines, who co-founded ScrapCATapp.com, an auction site for used catalytic converters. For the most part, the catalytic converters end up getting sold to recycling companies that strip out the materials to make new catalytic converters. Recycling is far cheaper than relying on new, mined metails, said Waitas. And no matter how old a catylitic converter is, those metals are still there. \u201cThat cat will always contain those metals and all you\u2019ve got to do is go through the process of removing the metals from the substrate and whatever contaminants,\u201d he said. For the the victim, of course, the price is much higher as replacing a catalytic converter can cost more than $2,000 including parts and labor. While it might not sound like it would matter much, getting the catalytic converter stolen can can make a car virtually undrivable. If your catalytic converter is stolen, the first thing you\u2019ll likely notice is the sound. When you start the engine the car will be really loud because, with the exhaust pipe cut, exhaust won\u2019t be channeled through the car\u2019s muffler anymore. Thats the part that reduces, or muffles, engine sound. Then you\u2019ll notice the orange \u201ccheck engine\u201d light and you\u2019ll probably also notice the smell of untreated exhaust fumes wafting up. If you persist in driving, you may also notice uneven acceleration because the engine isn\u2019t being forced to push the exhaust down that long pipe and through the catalytic converter and the muffler, anymore. Since the engine was set up to deal with that back-pressure, not having a working exhaust system will cause performance issues. If this happens, don\u2019t drive the car. Report the theft to police and your car insurance company. Get the catalytic converter replaced. The good news is, these days, it\u2019s at least a little less likely to happen. And electric vehicles, which are gaining market share, don\u2019t have catalytic converters to steal in the first place.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/cars/catalytic-converter-theft-stealing-auto/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_30_food_taco-bell-cheez-it-release", "text": "One of the most eagerly anticipated items ever made by Taco Bell is finally getting a nationwide release. Two years ago, Taco Bell and Cheez-It created two new menu items that used a massive cheese cracker \u2014 16-times bigger than normal \u2014 for a test sold at only one restaurant, sparking a frenzy among its fans. Beginning June 6, the collaboration is going nationwide for a limited time. The \u201cBig Cheez-It Tostada\u201d and \u201cBig Cheez-It Crunchwrap Supreme\u201d are being added to US menus following a trial run that got \u201coverwhelmingly positive reaction\u201d and proved that the it Cheez-It menu items \u201cbrought something new to the table,\u201d Taco Bell said in a press release Thursday. These kinds of collaboration often bring publicity to both brands, allowing them to expand their reach. And the Taco Bell and Cheez-It collaboration comes as consumer brands across the country, from retailers to restaurants and more, find inflation-weary consumers are pulling back on spending. The \u201cBig Cheez-It Tostada\u201d layers ground beef, reduced-fat sour cream, tomatoes, lettuce and cheddar cheese on the cheesy cracker for $3.99. The \u201cBig Cheez-It Crunchwrap Supreme\u201d replaces the internal tostada shell with a giant Cheez-It for $5.49, with mostly the same ingredients, except nacho cheese sauce in place of shredded cheese. Both items received slight prices increases from their 2022 test, but a new offer as a part of this release is a \u201cBig Cheez-It Box\u201d deal, which includes the \u201cBig Cheez-It Crunchwrap Supreme,\u201d a five-layer beef burrito, nacho fries and a medium drink for $8.99. Like other fast food chains, Taco Bell\u2019s parent, Yum Brands, isn\u2019t resistant to a slowdown in consumer spending, especially among lower-income diners. In the company\u2019s most recent earnings report, released in early May, revenue missed analysts\u2019 expectations as Pizza Hut and KFC same-store sales dropped. Taco Bell, which makes up a vast majority of Yum\u2019s US profits, was the lone bright spot: Same-store sales grew 2% for the first quarter. Shares of Yum Brands (YUM) have risen nearly 5% for the year. Earlier this year, Taco Bell unveiled its full slate of menu items rolling out in 2024, which also includes other foods have fans been craving (but the chain hasn\u2019t yet revealed release dates). On tap in the coming months include a Mountain Dew Baja Blast gelato and collaborations with other brands, like Tajin and Cinnabon, which are part of broader growth plans for the brand.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/food/taco-bell-cheez-it-release/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_30_business_american-consumer-economic-engine", "text": "It\u2019s becoming tougher and tougher for Americans to carry on with their spending spree. Years of elevated inflation and the highest interest rates in almost a quarter century are wearing out the US consumer. Savings accumulated during the Covid-19 pandemic are drying up, borrowers continue to rack up debt and delinquencies are marching higher. Retailers say shoppers are fed up with rising prices and are changing their purchasing behavior. Americans power economic growth with their spending, and they\u2019re being buffeted from every direction. US consumers unleashed a tsunami of demand when the economy ascended from pandemic depths. That momentum persisted last year as Americans gladly opened their wallets, selling out high-profile concerts and breaking travel records, which also staved off a widely anticipated recession. Such exuberance is being kept alive by America\u2019s solid job market, with sub-4% unemployment, nearly two million job openings more than unemployed people seeking work and wages that are outpacing inflation. The job market is proving to be the US economy\u2019s saving grace, but it is unmistakable that Americans are feeling pinched. Once that shoe drops, it could cause an earthquake for the world\u2019s biggest economy. \u201cAs long as people stay employed, they\u2019ll continue to spend because it\u2019s hard to pull back dramatically without feeling like you\u2019re shortchanging yourself,\u201d Carol Schleif, chief investment officer at BMO Family Office, told CNN. \u201cBut consumers are being very selective now, and they will cut back if they have to.\u201d A slowdown according to economic data Given the barrage of economic hurdles facing consumers, economists are paying close attention for a turning point. Sales at US retailers and restaurants were unexpectedly flat in April, missing the 0.4% gain economists projected. Retail spending, which is adjusted for seasonal swings but not inflation, was also revised down for March. A second estimate of gross domestic product, released Thursday, showed that consumer spending was weaker in the first three months of the year than initially reported. Consumption, which accounts for about two-thirds of the US economy, advanced 2% in the first quarter, down from the 2.5% reflected in the first estimate. That resulted in gross domestic product overall to be revised down to a 1.3% annualized rate, compared to the 1.6% initially estimated. Economists polled by FactSet are expecting data to be released Friday to show that consumer spending slowed notably in April from March. But perhaps the most unsettling economic release that came in below economists\u2019 expectations was the employment report for April. Employers added just 175,000 jobs last month, a big miss from the 235,000 jobs economists projected in a FactSet poll. And instead of holding steady at 3.8%, as expected, the unemployment rate edged higher to 3.9%. The job market is humming along just fine for now, but for how much longer remains to be seen. It\u2019s unclear if the recent slate of disappointing figures means the economy will weaken further or rebound because one month\u2019s data \u2014 not even one quarter\u2019s \u2014 does not make a trend. Warnings from retailers Retail earnings have painted a mixed picture, but lower and middle-income customers are now pulling back. Walmart (WMT) saw customers across income brackets shop more frequently at the chain across the first three months of the year, including higher-income consumers buying groceries in a sign that consumers are squeezed. Other chains have seen similar signals. Lower-income consumers bought more private-label brands and $1 items at Dollar General during its latest quarter, that company said. Kohl\u2019s (KSS) stock plunged more than 20% Thursday after weak quarterly results, showing how middle-income customers have pulled back on non-essential clothing and discretionary merchandise at department stores. \u201cOur customers continue to be pressured by a number of economic factors, including high interest rates and inflation,\u201d Kohl\u2019s CEO Thomas Kingsbury said on a call with analysts on Thursday. \u201cOur middle income customer continues to be impacted.\u201d Target, Home Depot and Best Buy, which have been some of the strongest retailers in recent years, have taken a hit from the pullback in discretionary goods. Many retailers have slashed prices and ramped up discounts to try to boost demand.Still, there have been bright spots in the retail industry. TJX, the parent of TJ Maxx and Home Goods, has surged as consumers seek out bargains. And Abercrombie & Fitch, a 1990s mainstay, has tapped into consumer nostalgia to revitalize the brand. Economists were humbled last year when their bets that the economy would fall into a recession proved to be flat-out wrong, so the economy\u2019s resilience ought not to be underestimated. But the latest data and earnings results show that the economic landscape remains undeniably tough and it is putting Americans to the test.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/business/american-consumer-economic-engine/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_05_30_business_jeep-reveals-its-first-american-ev", "text": "Jeep, widely known for making rugged off-road vehicles, has unveiled its first fully electric SUV for the North American market. Jeep already offers the small Avenger EV in Europe but the Wagnoneer S, unveiled Thursday night, will be available in the US and Canada later this year before being sold in other markets, becoming Jeep\u2019s first \u201cglobal\u201d EV. The Wagoneer S will test the appetite of Jeep customers for a fully electric model. It comes at a time of waning interest in electric vehicles, even as regulatory requirements for them become more stringent. The new SUV embodies Jeep parent company Stellantis\u2019s flexible strategy toward developing and building EVs. New Stellantis vehicles are designed so the same basic engineering can be used to build gas-powered, plug-in hybrid or fully electric models, allowing the automaker to pivot quickly to meet market demand, executives have said. Jeep chief executive Antonio Filosa did not rule out a possible future plug-in hybrid versions of the Wagoneer S with technology similar to the Ram Ramcharger pickup if the company sees demand. Unlike most plug-in hybrids, the Ramcharger is capable of driving a long way on electricity only before running on a gas-powered engine. For now, that\u2019s not planned, though. The new Wagoneer S has a sleeker, more aerodynamic shape than the Jeep Wagoneer models sold today. The SUV will produce up to 600 horsepower from two electric motors and will be able to accelerate to 60 miles an hour in just 3.4 seconds, Stellantis announced. It will also be able to drive more than 300 miles on a fully charged battery pack before needing to recharge, according to Stellantis. While off-road capability is a core part of Jeep\u2019s brand image, Stellantis did not boast of off-road capability in its unveiling of the Wagoneer S. But the company revealed a concept version called the Wagoneer S Trailhawk, with large off-road tires and raised suspension, alongside the planned production model. Jeep is working on putting the Wagoneer S Trailhawk into production, Filosa said in an interview with CNN. \u201cThat will be in the range with the most capable Jeep that we have out there,\u201d he said. Jeep\u2019s product plans already include a rugged off-road capable EV called the Recon which will be available early next year. In part due to environmental concerns, the Wagoneer S will not have wood or leather inside and no chrome on the exterior. It will be the first model in Stellantis\u2019s move away from using chrome on its vehicles, Gilles said, because of concerns over the chemicals used in its production. \u201cStellantis is going to back out of chrome over time,\u201d said Gilles. \u201cHexavalent chrome, we know, is not the most amazing thing for the planet, so as we go we\u2019re going to be killing it off.\u201d In place of leather inside the vehicle will be synthetic materials that, Gilles promised, will have the feel of actual leather. Since Jeep\u2019s trademark seven-slot grille isn\u2019t needed to cool a gas engine, it will light up instead to illuminate a walking path toward the SUV at night. Drivers can select from five \u201cdrive modes \u201d \u2014 Auto, Sport, Eco, Snow, and Sand \u2014 that will automatically adjust things like power output to individual wheels and the response of traction control systems. The Wagoneer S will go on sale later this year at a starting price of around $72,000 for well-equipped \u201cLaunch Edition\u201d models.

That $17 billion (without the debt) sounds like a big number, Stewart Glickman, senior equity analyst at CFRA, told Before the Bell. \u201cBut in the grand scheme of things,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s really not that huge.\u201d Overall, there will be about 152 million new shares of ConocoPhillips issued, which amounts to about 13% of the company\u2019s existing share base. If the purchase did nothing for the ConocoPhillips\u2019 bottom line, it would dilute their earnings, but that\u2019s highly unlikely. The company said in a release that it expects the merger to immediately boost earnings, cash flow and return of capital per share. The deal would also send the company\u2019s crude production higher by 31%, based on first-quarter levels, said Stewart. ConocoPhillips said it was targeting savings worth $500 million within the first full year of the transaction closing, which is expected in the fourth quarter of 2024 pending the approval of Marathon shareholders and regulators. The company also expects to repurchase $7 billion in shares in the first full year, and over $20 billion in the first three years. That would more than offset the new shares to be issued in the deal. Separately, ConocoPhillips said it plans to increase its quarterly dividend by 34% in the last quarter of 2024. An environment for deals: Wednesday\u2019s announcement follows a wave of consolidation in the energy sector. The merger follows ExxonMobil\u2019s (XOM) $60 billion purchase of Pioneer earlier this month and Chevron\u2019s (CVX) takeover of Hess for $53 billion, which was approved by shareholders this week. It also comes after Occidental\u2019s purchase of CrownRock last December and Diamondback Energy\u2019s acquiring of Endeavor Energy Partners this March in multibillion-dollar cash-and-stock deals. This slew of mergers and acquisitions, said Stewart, are happening because energy companies aren\u2019t interested in spending loads of money to grow organically. It\u2019s cheaper to buy someone else\u2019s portfolio than to spend money on exploring and drilling on new land. \u201cInvestors are not fond of that at the moment\u2026 everybody has gotten accustomed to buybacks and dividends as a great destination for operating cash flow,\u201d said Stewart. He estimates big oil companies are spending about half of what they were 10 years ago on capital expenditures. That means that companies are growing by \u201cbuying out somebody else and using share capital to make that purchase.\u201d This merger, he said, is emblematic of just that \u2013 an appeal to shareholders. McDonald\u2019s: Our prices haven\u2019t risen as much as you think McDonald\u2019s has a message for America: Rumors of Big Mac inflation are greatly exaggerated. \u201cRecently, we have seen viral social posts and poorly sourced reports that McDonald\u2019s has raised prices significantly beyond inflationary rates. This is inaccurate,\u201d Joe Erlinger,\u00a0president of McDonald\u2019s USA, wrote\u00a0in an open letter posted to the company\u2019s website on Wednesday. \u201cThe average price of a Big Mac in the U.S. was $4.39 in 2019,\u201d he said. \u201cDespite a global pandemic and historic rises in supply chain costs, wages and other inflationary pressures in the years that followed, the average cost is now $5.29. That\u2019s an increase of 21% (not 100%).\u201d What Erlinger wants customers to know is not that high-priced McDonald\u2019s burgers don\u2019t exist at all. He just wants them to know that the burgers that have been cited as proof of radically higher prices are not the norm, reports my colleague Danielle Wiener-Bronner. \u201cIt frustrates and worries me, and many of our franchisees, when I hear about an $18 Big Mac meal being sold \u2014 even if it was at one location in the U.S. out of more than 13,700,\u201d he said. \u201cMore worrying, though, is when people believe that this is the rule and not the exception, or when folks start to suggest that the prices of a Big Mac have risen 100% since 2019.\u201d Online, people have\u00a0been airing their fast food price grievances. But they\u2019re\u00a0not just griping: Customers are pulling back on spending, too. Diners, frustrated by higher prices, are not\u00a0going out to eat as often and spending less\u00a0when they do, causing fast food sales to slow and traffic to dip. Erlinger is fighting back because\u00a0McDonald\u2019s pricey burgers\u00a0have become something of a symbol of elevated fast food prices. And being seen as overpriced could hamper sales and reputation, especially at McDonald\u2019s. \u201cIt\u2019s imperative that we continue to keep affordability at the forefront for our customers,\u201d McDonald\u2019s CEO Chris Kempczinski said during an April 30 analyst call. \u201cWe literally wrote the playbook on value, and we are committed to upholding our leadership within the industry.\u201d Read more here. Dollar Tree is moving into 99 Cents Only stores Goodbye 99 Cents Only. Hello Dollar Tree. Dollar Tree announced Wednesday it acquired leases for 170 of 99 Cents Only\u2019s stores out of bankruptcy in Arizona, California, Nevada and Texas. Dollar Tree will reopen these stores with its own products under its brand beginning in the fall, reports my colleague Nathaniel Meyersohn. 99 Cents Only had\u00a0filed for bankruptcy in April\u00a0and closed all of its 370 locations. The two chains are very different, and the announcement is a sign of consolidation in the retail industry. 99 Cents Only was a regional chain and sold groceries. Dollar Tree, a national company with mostly suburban locations, primarily offers discretionary merchandise like party supplies and home goods. Dollar Tree was the last dollar store chain to sell everything for $1 before\u00a0raising prices in 2021 to $1.25\u00a0and above. Dollar Tree also owns Family Dollar, based mostly in cities. Family Dollar has underperformed Dollar Tree and other discount chains in recent years, and it\u2019s\u00a0closing 975 stores. The acquisition of 99 Cents Only leases out of bankruptcy gives Dollar Tree a cheaper way to grow rather than building new stores and helps the Virginia-based chain extend its reach on the West Coast.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_19_success_wall-street-bonuses", "text": "Last year wasn\u2019t the most lucrative for Wall Street bankers, but their bonus payouts still easily trounced US median household income. The average Wall Street bonus for 2023 was $176,500, according to estimates that will be released Tuesday morning by New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli. That\u2019s down 2% from the $180,000 recorded in 2022. Both those averages were well below the $240,000 paid out in 2021. That the average bonus was slightly down isn\u2019t surprising. Wall Street earnings last year were mixed, and merger and acquisition activity was underwhelming. \u201cWall Street\u2019s profits were up 1.8% in 2023, but firms have taken a more cautious approach to compensation and more employees have joined the securities industry, which accounts for the slight decline in the average bonus,\u201d DiNapoli said in a statement. Nevertheless, a little perspective: The average Wall Street bonus, which comes on top of the nearly half-a-million-dollar average Wall Street salary, was itself almost 2.5 times higher than the median US household income of $74,580, according to Census data for 2022. Wall Street bonuses and general employment in the securities industry provide vital revenue streams for the New York State and New York City economies, accounting most recently for 27% of the state\u2019s tax collections and 7% of city tax revenue, according to DiNapoli\u2019s office. The securities industry \ufeffin the city employed roughly 198,500 people last year, up from 191,600 the year before. And DiNapoli estimates that 1 in 11 of the city\u2019s jobs are either directly or indirectly associated with the industry. The total estimated bonus pool for 2023 was\u00a0slightly lower than the year before and is\u00a0projected to bring in $4 million less in state income tax revenue and $2 million less for the city revenue than bonuses in 2022 did. Still, DiNapoli noted, \u201cWhile these bonuses affect income tax revenues for the state and city, both budgeted for larger declines so the impact on projected revenues should be limited.\u201d It should be noted that the comptroller\u2019s numbers only reflect the bonuses paid to securities industry employees working for firms based in New York City. Beyond bringing in tax revenue for government coffers, Wall Street workers contribute substantially to the local Gotham economy. DiNapoli said that more employees in financial services (65%) are working in-office on any given day compared to 58% working in other industries in the city, at least as of September 2023. And that securities industry employees use the subway more than other workers in the city. All in, he estimates that Wall Street is responsible for roughly 14% of economic activity in the city. As critical as that is, the city and state are about much more than just Wall Street. \u201cThe securities industry\u2019s continued strength should not overshadow the broader economic picture in New York, where we need all sectors to enjoy full recovery from the pandemic,\u201d DiNapoli said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/19/success/wall-street-bonuses/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "business"}}

The jury might still be deliberating, but Donald Trump\u2019s media allies have already delivered a verdict to their audiences Throughout the duration of the Manhattan hush-money trial, Fox News and the rest of MAGA Media have set the stage to absolve Trump in the historic case. Day after day, week after week, popular personalities such as Sean Hannity, Laura Ingraham, and Steve Bannon have lampooned the judicial system, portraying Trump as an innocent victim of political persecution. Inside this alternate media universe, the actual facts of the case never penetrate the bubble that shields its audiences from detrimental developments for Trump. Instead, alternate dishonest storylines are disseminated as the gospel truth. Not only is Trump entirely innocent of any and all wrongdoing in the MAGA Media world, but President Joe Biden is guilty of nefariously weaponizing government to wage \u201clawfare\u201d on his political opponent. Audiences are told that Biden cannot win a fair fight with Trump, so he has resorted to illegal \u201celection interference\u201d by rigging the judicial system against Trump. It goes without saying that these narratives are built on foundations of lies and innuendo that do not hold water. Biden does not control the judicial system. The hush-money case is taking place in New York state court with charges brought by the Manhattan district attorney. And it isn\u2019t Trump\u2019s left-wing enemies who have been making headlines testifying against the GOP candidate in the case, it\u2019s his former allies, such as one-time fixer Michael Cohen and former National Enquirer boss David Pecker. Nevertheless, millions consuming right-wing media have been fed these deceptive storylines, impacting how voters perceive current events and, more importantly, cast their ballots. In the Republican Party, voters absorb their information from outlets like Fox News, which has dishonestly run defense for Trump over the course of the trial. \u201cWHERE\u2019S THE CRIME?\u201d demanded a banner on Ingraham\u2019s prime time show Wednesday along with a graphic showing images of Biden, Judge Juan Merchan, and Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg \u201cTHE REAL FRAUDS.\u201d In the following hour, Jesse Watters accused Merchan in an on-screen graphic of \u201cLEADING THE JURY\u201d and intimated how \u201cvery fishy\u201d it was that a \u201cstop Trump\u201d judge was selected to preside over the case. The progressive Media Matters said in a study published this week that Fox News has leveled at least 200 attacks on Merchan alone since the trial commenced \u2014 a staggering number that does not include the attacks on others associated with the case. And the study only accounted for Fox News, not the host of other entities that make up the right-wing media universe. It can be tempting to ignore the torrent of attacks Trump\u2019s media allies are launching in their unrelenting efforts to undermine the case. But those forces are shaping how a large swath of the country understands the high-stakes and unprecedented trial taking place in lower Manhattan. And they\u2019re a reminder that if Trump were to return to power, he has a powerful propaganda apparatus at his disposal that will do everything in its power to sanitize his actions \u2014 whatever they may be.", "source": "http://cnn.com/business/media/fox-news-right-wing-media-trump-trial-verdict/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_business_uvalde-lawsuit-meta-activision", "text": "Three companies are facing\u00a0wrongful death lawsuits\u00a0in the Uvalde school shooting of 2022, according to complaints filed\u00a0in\u00a0California and Texas. The suits, which accuse the companies of \u201cgrooming\u201d the Robb Elementary School shooter,\u00a0come after 19 families of students and teachers killed\u00a0at the school announced on Wednesday that\u00a0they settled a lawsuit with the city for $2 million. The companies \u2013 Meta, Activision\u00a0and Daniel Defense \u2013 all contributed to the behavior of\u00a0the\u00a0shooter\u00a0Salvador Ramos\u00a0in one way or another, the suits allege. Ramos\u00a0downloaded\u00a0the video game\u00a0\u201cCall of Duty: Modern Warfare\u201d in November 2021, according to the complaint filed in California against the publisher of the game, Activision, Meta, and others. The game featured a weapon from Daniel Defense called the DDM4 V7, which served as \u201ca teaser for players eager to try out the weapon,\u201d the suit alleges. At the same time, Ramos\u00a0\u201cwas being courted through explicit, aggressive marketing,\u201d on Instagram, the suit said. Meta\u00a0is the parent company of Instagram. \u201cIn addition to hundreds of images depicting and glorifying the thrill of combat, Daniel Defense used Instagram to extol the illegal, murderous use of its weapons,\u201d the suit said. \u201cWithin weeks of downloading Modern Warfare, the Shooter was browsing assault weapons, acquiring firearm attachments popularized by the game, and returning repeatedly to Daniel Defense\u2019s website.\u201d \u201cMere minutes after midnight on May 16\u2014the Shooter\u2019s 18th birthday\u2014he purchased a DDM4V7,\u201d the suit said. \u201cEight days later, the Shooter inflicted unspeakable violence at Robb Elementary School, killing 21 and injuring and traumatizing many more.\u201d Investigators in the Uvalde shooting found\u00a0one of Ramos\u2019 AR15-style rifles, manufactured by Daniel Defense, in the school,\u00a0according to then-Texas state Sen. John Whitmire, who is now the mayor of Houston. \u201cThe Defendants bear responsibility for this profound corruption of our children,\u201d the suit filed in California Superior Court in Los Angeles says. \u201cIn concert with certain firearm manufacturers, they have groomed a generation of young men who are socially vulnerable, insecure about their masculinity, and eager to show strength and assert dominance.\u201d According to the suit filed in Uvalde, Texas District Court, Daniel Defense\u00a0courts adolescents by harnessing and exploiting \u201cthe power of social media and first-person shooter simulations to lure teenagers to its website where it can monitor their online activity, build a profile of their interests, and solicit their contact information.\u201d In a statement,\u00a0Josh\u00a0Koskoff,\u00a0a\u00a0partner at\u00a0Koskoff,\u00a0Koskoff\u00a0& Bieder and\u00a0an\u00a0attorney for the families said:\u00a0\u201cThere is a direct line between the conduct of these companies and the Uvalde shooting.\u00a0Just 23 minutes after midnight on his 18th birthday, the Uvalde shooter bought an AR-15 made by a company with a market share of less than one percent. Why? Because, well before he was old enough to purchase it, he was targeted and cultivated online by Instagram, Activision and Daniel Defense. This three-headed monster knowingly exposed him to the weapon, conditioned him to see it as a tool to solve his problems and trained him to use it.\u201d A company spokesperson for Activision said in a statement to CNN Friday: \u201cThe Uvalde shooting was horrendous and heartbreaking in every way, and we express our deepest sympathies to the families and communities who remain impacted by this senseless act of violence. Millions of people around the world enjoy video games without turning to horrific acts.\u201d CNN has reached out to\u00a0Meta\u00a0and Daniel Defense for comment.

{"id": "2024_03_27_media_nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over", "text": "Only 80 hours elapsed between NBC News announcing Ronna McDaniel as a paid contributor and the network ousting her from that very role. But for the leadership at NBC Universal News Group, those were 80\u00a0painful hours. On Tuesday evening, following another full day in which the media rumor mill churned at warp speed, NBCU News Group boss Cesar Conde sent staff a memo, notifying his troops that he had reversed his decision to welcome the former Republican National Committee chair to \u201cthe team.\u201d \u201cAfter listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor,\u201d Conde said, adding that he wanted to \u201cpersonally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down.\u201d Conde had no real choice. The embattled NBCU boss, who I\u2019m told dealt with the crisis from an unknown location outside of 30 Rock, was facing an unprecedented rebellion from his most high-profile stars, who one by one went on the air and excoriated leadership\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel. The only aspect of Conde\u2019s note that was surprising was the fact that it came 48 hours late, allowing what started off as a crisis to fester and balloon into one of the worst corporate public relations calamities in recent memory. \u201cWhat a sh*t show!\u201d a media executive exclaimed to me Tuesday shortly after Conde relieved McDaniel of her NBC News credentials. In his note, Conde said he took \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for McDaniel\u2019s hire. But, he also did point the finger, telling staffers that hiring her was \u201ca collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team.\u201d Indeed, multiple people familiar with the matter have told me that the infighting among NBC executives over who was at fault for the disaster has reached a fever pitch, with various factions of the NBCU News Group assigning blame to others. Regardless of who is to blame, the entire affair made clear who is actually in control of the company \u2014 and it\u2019s not Conde & Co. Despite the NBCU C-suite digging their heels in the sand as they resisted dumping McDaniel for days, they were ultimately forced to succumb to pressure from their talent. As a second media executive commented to me, it is now \u201cvery clear who is in charge\u201d after the \u201cweak leadership was put on full display.\u201d \u201cHas Cesar lost the room?\u201d wondered a third media executive. While the Peacock family argues over who was really at fault, the company is facing a fresh public relations mess. Led by Donald Trump, right-wing personalities are already assailing the network as being overrun with intolerant woke leftists. \u201cThese Radical Left Lunatics are CRAZY and the top people at NBC ARE WEAK,\u201d Trump raged on his Truth Social platform. Ari Fleischer, who served as press secretary under President George W. Bush, wrote on X: \u201cWhat NBC is saying is if you\u2019re for Trump, you don\u2019t belong. Good. Let NBC be for Democrats only.\u201d Of course, that narrative is intellectually dishonest. The objection to McDaniel from both within and outside of NBCU was not that she is a Republican. It wasn\u2019t even that she was a Trump-supporting Republican. No, the objection stemmed from the fact that McDaniel was an active participant in the plot to subvert the 2020 vote. And, in addition to that disgraceful history, she had a lengthy track record smearing NBC News and MSNBC. Nevertheless, NBCU will now have to contend with such dishonest attacks being leveled by the right, which will follow them in the days, months, and even years to come. As unfair as it may be, they will certainly damage the network\u2019s brand in Republican circles \u2014 a place it had gone through great pains to appeal to. NBCU will also have to grapple with McDaniel, who spent the last 24 hours or so interviewing lawyers as she gears up for a possible legal fight with the network, according to a person familiar with the matter. The rift between McDaniel and NBCU had grown to such an extent by Tuesday that she was not informed by network brass that she had been dismissed, I\u2019m told. Instead, McDaniel learned of her ouster in press reports. While NBCU is being beaten up on the right, the company\u2019s leadership was quickly praised by its journalists and top stars. Shortly after Conde sent out his memo, Rachel Maddow appeared on Joy Reid\u2019s show, where the two lauded Conde for reversing course. \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/27/media/nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_25_business_red-lobster-bankruptcy-thai-union", "text": "When seafood conglomerate Thai Union Group became Red Lobster\u2019s leading shareholder in 2020, gaining 49% control of the chain, Red Lobster employees were assured Thai Union would not interfere in key decisions. Thai Union will \u201cnot be involved in Red Lobster\u2019s day-to-day operations, including [its] supply chain standards and processes,\u201d according to a document titled \u201cSeafood Supplier Talking Points\u201d viewed by CNN that was approved by top Thai Union and Red Lobster executives. \u201cWe intend to maintain relationships with all current seafood suppliers,\u201d the talking points said. Those pledges didn\u2019t last. By 2022, representatives from Thai Union in Thailand, whose $4 billion empire includes brands like Chicken of the Sea and John West Foods, were embedded in Red Lobster\u2019s Orlando headquarters, serving in top roles and closely directing the largest seafood restaurant chain in the world. \u201cWe are much deeper involved in the management of Red Lobster,\u201d Thai Union finance chief Ludovic Garnier said on an analyst call in November 2022. Now, Red Lobster has drowned in a relentless supply of Thai Union-supplied shrimp. Red Lobster filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy Sunday, and it plans to sell its business to its lenders. In turn, Red Lobster will receive financing to stay afloat. Thai Union\u2019s damaging decisions drove the pioneering chain\u2019s fall, according to 13 former Red Lobster executives and senior leaders in various areas of the business as well as analysts. All but two of the former Red Lobster employees spoke to CNN under the condition of anonymity because of either non-disclosure agreements with Thai Union; fear that speaking out would harm their careers; or because they don\u2019t want to jeopardize deferred compensation from Red Lobster. Thai Union earlier this year blamed the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as \u201csustained industry headwinds, higher interest rates and rising material and labor costs\u201d for Red Lobster\u2019s struggles. In a statement to CNN, Thai Union said it \u201chas a been a supplier to Red Lobster for more than 30 years, and we intend for that relationship to continue.\u201d A bankruptcy process \u201cwill allow Red Lobster to restructure its financial obligations and realize its long-term potential in a more favorable operating environment,\u201d the company said.\u00a0Thai Union did not respond to CNN\u2019s questions about the specific allegations raised in this story. Former Red Lobster employees say that while the pandemic, inflation and rent costs impacted Red Lobster, Thai Union\u2019s ineptitude was the pivotal factor in Red Lobster\u2019s decline. \u201cIt was miserable working there for the last year and a half I was there,\u201d said Les Foreman, a West Coast division vice president who worked at Red Lobster for 20 years and was fired in 2022. \u201cThey didn\u2019t have any idea about running a restaurant company in the United States.\u201d Thai Union asserts control At Red Lobster headquarters, employees prided themselves on a fiercely loyal culture and low turnover. Some employees had been with the chain for 30 and 40 years. But as Thai Union installed executives at the chain, dozens of veteran Red Lobster leaders with deep knowledge of the brand and restaurant industry were fired or resigned in rapid succession. Red Lobster ended up having five CEOs in five years. Thai Union CEO Thiraphong Chansiri visited Red Lobster\u2019s headquarters in 2022 and toured restaurants around the country. He brought along a feng shui consultant named Angel to Orlando, former senior leaders at Red Lobster headquarters told CNN. The consultant determined that executive offices in Orlando were \u201cbad Feng shui and no one should use them,\u201d one former leader told CNN. The executive offices sat empty. Former Red Lobster employees describe a toxic and demoralizing environment as Thai Union-appointed executives descended on headquarters and interim CEO Paul Kenny eventually took over the chain in 2022. Kenny, an Australian-born former CEO of Minor Food, one of Asia\u2019s largest casual dining and quick-service restaurants, was part of the Thai Union-led investor group that acquired Red Lobster. Kenny criticized Red Lobster employees at meetings and made derogatory comments about them, according to former Red Lobster leaders who worked closely with Kenny. Commenting on a woman\u2019s weight at a Red Lobster annual conference in 2022 in Dallas as she walked across a stage to accept an award, Kenny said, \u201cwe need to institute an exercise program in this company,\u201d another former Red Lobster executive told CNN. Kenny did not respond to CNN\u2019s requests for comment on these allegations. Under Kenny, Red Lobster also cut two of its longtime shrimp suppliers\u2014 and competitors to Thai Union \u2014 to purchase more shrimp from Thai Union at higher costs, according to Red Lobster\u2019s bankruptcy filing. Kenny\u2019s decision came \u201cin apparent coordination with Thai Union and under the guise of a \u2018quality review,\u2019\u201d Red Lobster said. These changes culminated in a $20 endless shrimp promotion in 2023 that would come back to haunt Red Lobster. \u201cThai Union exercised an outsized influence on the Company\u2019s shrimp purchasing,\u201d Red Lobster alleged in its bankruptcy filing. Red Lobster said it was \u201cinvestigating whether Mr. Kenny\u2019s decision-making process circumvented the Company\u2019s normal supply chain and demand planning.\u201d Thai Union told CNN that Red Lobster\u2019s accusations in the bankruptcy filing were \u201cmeritless,\u201d and the company looks forward to a \u201cfull representation of the facts.\u201d Red Lobster also slowed investments in dining room upgrades, raised prices and cut labor under Thai Union, former executives and operations leaders say. These decisions pushed away customers and cut into Red Lobster\u2019s sales. Red Lobster\u2019s annual customer count has dropped by 30% since 2019, Red Lobster said in its bankruptcy filing. Paul Kenny steps in Red Lobster was started in 1968 by Bill Darden, an architect of the casual dining revolution in America. General Mills quickly bought Red Lobster and in 1995 spun the chain off into a new company, Darden Restaurants, named after its founder. In 2014, Darden sold Red Lobster to Golden Gate Capital, a private equity firm, for $2.1 billion.\u00a0 To help fund the deal, Red Lobster spun off its real estate. The arrangement wound up hurting Red Lobster because it became stuck with leases it no longer could afford to pay as the business struggled. Two years later, Thai Union took a $575 million minority stake in Red Lobster. In 2020, Thai Union expanded that stake, leading an investor group to buy out Golden Gate Capital and acquire Red Lobster. During the first half of 2021, Red Lobster posted an operating profit, and Thai Union touted Red Lobster\u2019s strength on calls with analysts and company presentations. \u201cRed Lobster\u2019s turnaround continued amid the pandemic,\u201d Thai Union said in a quarterly earnings presentation in August of 2021. There was \u201cclear improvement in Red Lobster operations.\u201d Red Lobster re-hired 26,000 employees from January to August of 2021, Thai Union said in the presentation, and appointed Kelli Valade CEO. Valade brought on a new leadership team, including a new head of finance, chief marketing officer and chief information officer. But Kenny, then a Red Lobster board member, soon began exercising more control. In early 2022, Kenny began visiting Red Lobster\u2019s headquarters more frequently and touring restaurants, former Red Lobster employees who worked closely with Kenny say. At a tense board meeting in late March 2022, Kenny disagreed with Valade that significant further investment was needed in Red Lobster, according to a former Red Lobster leader. He chastised Red Lobster\u2019s management team, which included Valade\u2019s three recently hired executives, this person said. Within 48 hours, Valade resigned, just eight months into her tenure. Another Red Lobster board member who had decades of experience running casual dining restaurants in the United States resigned a day after. Valade was appointed Denny\u2019s CEO two months later. She did not respond to CNN\u2019s requests for comment. Severe cuts Kenny was initially described in a press release announcing Valade\u2019s resignation as a \u201cliaison\u201d between Red Lobster\u2019s leadership and the board of directors \u201cduring this time of transition.\u201d But, at the direction of Thai Union, Kenny became interim CEO, according to Red Lobster\u2019s bankruptcy filing. In the months after Kenny took over, Valade\u2019s leadership team and other veteran leaders left. In July of 2022, the chief operations officer and six vice presidents of operations overseeing restaurants were abruptly fired shortly before Red Lobster\u2019s annual general manager conference. Kenny appointed a Thai Union frozen seafood manager, Trin Tapanya, as Red Lobster\u2019s chief operations officer overseeing restaurants. Tapanya had no experience running restaurants. He did not respond to CNN\u2019s requests for comment. Other Thai Union representatives also became more closely involved across Red Lobster\u2019s supply chain, finance, operations and strategy teams. Under Kenny, changes to restaurant operations and menus alienated customers and staff and hurt sales. Red Lobster started charging for a side salad for the first time, angering some customers. \u201cWhen you spend $43.99 for a meal the salad should be part of it,\u201d one customer said recently on Facebook. \u201cTexas Roadhouse does not charge extra for a side salad. Red Lobster was my favorite place to eat, but no longer.\u201d The chain started leaving tails on shrimp in pasta and eliminated saut\u00e9 stations in kitchens to save on labor costs, according to a different former Red Lobster employee. It also squeezed Red Lobster\u2019s waitstaff, switching from servers covering three tables to 10 and removing a host at the entrance during lunch hours. Thai Union said at the time it was to improve customer service, but former Red Lobster employees say the change\u00a0taxed restaurant staff. Overstretched restaurant staff had fewer managers and cooks than ever, said Barry Fulghum, who started out as a dishwasher at Red Lobster in the 1970s and worked his way up to become an operations director, retiring last year. \u201cThere would be times we would have one or two people working the kitchen line,\u201d he said.\u00a0 \u201cWhat those cooks did on the line was amazing given the staffing situation they were dealt.\u201d Removing longtime suppliers Meanwhile, Thai Union took a larger role in Red Lobster\u2019s supply chain decisions, despite pledges in 2020 that it would not interfere. Red Lobster had spent decades developing a wide array of suppliers to buy at competitive prices and mitigate the risks of becoming too reliant on any single supplier. Thai Union blew that up. Red Lobster employees say they were pressured by Thai Union representatives to buy more seafood from Thai Union. Thai Union representatives also began sitting in on meetings between Red Lobster and seafood suppliers, said one of the former Red Lobster employees who witnessed these conversations. Thai Union was the direct competitor of these other seafood suppliers, and suddenly had intimate access to their products, prices and strategy. \u201cOur suppliers were really upset that [Thai Union representatives] were in those meetings with them,\u201d this person said. Shrimp dishes also became a larger focus of Red Lobster\u2019s menu under Thai Union, which was a large shrimp supplier to Red Lobster. \u201cEvery promotion was shrimp-centric,\u201d this person said. Endless shrimp Then came the endless shrimp. Endless shrimp had been a successful limited-time promotion at Red Lobster for nearly 20 years. But last summer, Red Lobster turned $20 \u201cUltimate Endless Shrimp\u201d into a permanent menu item instead. Kenny had been warned by Red Lobster leaders that $20 was too cheap to make a profit, according to a former employee who witnessed these conversations. But Red Lobster went ahead, turning it into an everyday offer in June 2023 and pushing the promotion heavily. (Kenny\u2019s decision was met with \u201csignificant pushback from other members of the [company\u2019s] management team,\u201d Red Lobster also said in its bankruptcy filing.) \u201cWe have a very, very bold proposition for the consumers in the US. It\u2019s $20, so it\u2019s really affordable,\u201d Thai Union finance chief Ludovic Garnier said on an earnings call in August 2023. But the move backfired. Customers sat at tables for long stretches of time, eating course after course of shrimp. Service slowed and wait times grew. Red Lobster lost $11 million following the deal, its bankruptcy filing states. Endless shrimp was an embarrassment for Red Lobster, spoofed on Comedy Central\u2019s \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d and social media. To former Red Lobster employees, it was the latest sign Thai Union was ill-suited to run the chain. Thai Union announced in January it was divesting from Red Lobster and taking a $530 million loss on its investment. A month later, Thai Union CEO Chansiri said the company was looking to sell the chain. Red Lobster, he said, \u201cis done [and] over with.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/business/red-lobster-bankruptcy-thai-union/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_25_business_burger-prices-memorial-day", "text": "Burger patties, buns and ketchup prices are high. But even with the increases, your home-grilled burger could end up being relatively inexpensive this year thanks to steep discounts offered by retailers vying for budget-conscious customers. In recent months, grocery prices have stayed flat and even started to fall. But some grilling staples are more expensive compared to last year. In the 12 months through April 21, ground beef prices rose 6.4% by volume compared to the period from a year earlier, according to US retail sales data from Circana. Packaged hamburger and hot dog bun prices were up 7% while potato chips were up 6.9%. Condiment prices saw a sharper jump with ketchup rising 8.9%, hot sauce increasing 7.6% and regular barbecue sauce spiking 14.6%. Some items had modest increases, like hot dogs, which went up by 1.4%. But the increases don\u2019t take into account the year\u2019s many Memorial Day deals. \u201cThis is going to be a year for aggressive discounting,\u201d said Chris DuBois, EVP and practice leader for the fresh foods practice at Circana. Retailers \u201cwant to win the customer trip,\u201d he said. \u201cI would expect pretty sharp discounts to be able to bring people in.\u201d It\u2019s discount season Retailers often offer sale prices ahead of major holidays in order to lure in customers. For stores, it can be worthwhile to break even, or take a loss, on certain discounted items in order just to get people in the door. Once inside, shoppers may well fill up their carts with full-priced items. But if they don\u2019t, at least they won\u2019t be shopping at a competitor. This year, in particular, is stacking up to be a really good one for deals. Consumers remain  worried about inflation and have been spending less as a result. Retailers, vying for much-needed foot traffic, have already been slashing prices, and are adding more discounts for the holiday. Target recently said that it is lowering prices on thousands of items. In addition, the big-box retailer is offering a number of Memorial Day deals for a limited time, including buy one, get one 20% off ground beef and burgers for rewards members for May 19-27. Members also get a discount on soda in that period and all customers get a deal on chips. Supermarket chain Kroger also has Memorial Day specials, including reduced rates for home brand sliced cheese, hamburger buns and potato chips. Meanwhile, low-cost grocer Aldi, which has been gaining popularity with its no frills approach and bargain prices, is reducing the prices of steak and chicken breasts through July 10, among other deals. Chicken products are among the items that have gotten less expensive this year, even before discounts. Chicken breast prices, for example,\u00a0fell 2.5% in the year through April, according to Circana, while wings have plunged 9.2%.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/business/burger-prices-memorial-day/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_15_success_best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund", "text": "The average federal tax refund is more than $3,000, according to the latest data from the IRS. Since the majority of tax filers get a refund, there\u2019s a fair chance you could get hundreds if not thousands of dollars back in overpaid taxes, especially if you\u2019re also owed a refund from your state government. That money may feel like a windfall, and it\u2019s easy to squander it on a lot of little things. But if you\u2019re looking to improve your current financial situation, here are seven ideas to consider. Well, technically six, but you\u2019ll enjoy the seventh the most. 1. Pay off high-rate debt If you are carrying a balance on your credit card and are paying 20% to 30% in interest, make this your first priority to pay down. At such sky-high rates, \u201cthe debt can grow faster than you can pay it off,\u201d said Eric Bronnenkant, a certified financial planner and head of tax at Betterment, a robo-advisory financial services firm that also has a human advice team on hand to help clients. Keyana Russ, a certified financial planner at Four Ponds Financial Planning, concurred that people\u2019s awareness of how much money they\u2019re paying in interest over time doesn\u2019t always register. \u201cWhat I usually see is people paying the minimum, or they\u2019re charging everyday expenses and not paying off the bill at the end of the month. \u2026 They don\u2019t understand how much interest they\u2019re paying,\u201d Russ said. For example, if you\u2019re carrying a $3,000 balance at 27% interest and you only pay a required minimum of $97.50 every month, it will take you 240 months (which is 20 years) just to pay off the $3,000 \u2014 and, in addition, you will have paid $3,044.57 in interest, for a total of $6,044.57, according to Bankrate.com\u2019s calculator. 2. Create or add to an emergency fund You can use your refund to start or bolster an emergency fund. When it comes to costly emergencies, there are many Americans who don\u2019t have at least three months\u2019 worth of living expenses set aside, let alone enough to easily handle an unexpected bill of $1,000. Be sure to stash the money in a high-yield savings account at an FDIC-insured bank, Russ suggested, noting that the best interest rates are typically offered by online banks. If you have high-rate debt and you\u2019re lacking emergency savings, Russ suggested you might use a portion of your refund to attack your debt and the other portion to create an emergency fund. Bronnenkant favors paying off the high-rate debt first, but, if you\u2019re low on emergency savings and need a critical repair to help keep your job \u2014 such as on your car \u2014 he said it might make sense to set aside money for that repair and put the rest toward your credit card or other high-rate debt. 3. Make an extra payment on your mortgage If you\u2019re carrying a mortgage at a high rate (e.g., 7% to 8%), and you\u2019re not saddled with credit card debt, you might consider making an extra payment or two. \u201cIt can make a difference in the long run towards your principal,\u201d Russ said.\u00a0 You can even view it as an additional form of savings, in the sense that you\u2019re saving yourself an extra 7% \ufeffor so in interest on the portion of the principal you\u2019re paying down, Bronnenkant noted. 4. Invest in a Roth IRA If your income qualifies you to contribute to a Roth IRA, you can contribute up to $7,000 this year ($8,000 if you\u2019re at least 50) with after-tax savings. That money will grow untaxed until retirement, at which point your withdrawals will be tax-free and penalty-free after age 59-1/2, assuming the account has been open for at least five years. (And note: You can still make a 2023 Roth contribution until April 15 this year. The contribution limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if you\u2019re age 50 or older. Bolstering your tax-free retirement savings is great.\u00a0But if you need to access some of your money well before you retire, you may take out any part of your contributions tax-free and penalty-free at any time, \ufeffBronnenkant said. You would only be taxed and penalized if you withdrew the earnings on your contributions before age 59-1/2. (For more information on Roth IRA withdrawal rules, here is an easy-to-understand rundown from Charles Schwab.) 5. Contribute enough to your 401(k) in 2024 to get your full employer match Speaking of retirement savings, if you\u2019re not yet contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match from your employer, a refund can make that easier. Say you get $3,000 back. You can put that money in a high-yield savings account to earn interest. Then, on your workplace 401(k) site, change your paycheck contribution levels so that by the end of the year you will have contributed $3,000 more in pre-tax money than you otherwise would have. For instance, say you\u2019re paid every two weeks and you have 20 more paychecks left until the end of the year. You can boost you biweekly contributions by $150 per paycheck ($150 x 20 = $3,000). \u201cYou want to get the max match from your employer,\u201d Bronnenkant said. 6. Invest for shorter-term goals If in the next three to 10 years you expect to buy a home, take a once-in-a-lifetime trip, renovate a room, send your kids to summer camp or have any other expensive goal, you might consider investing your refund in a diversified mix of low-cost, broad market index funds. The shorter term your goal is, the less risk you want to take. If you need the money within three years, you might consider putting your refund in certificates of deposits and US Treasury bonds. But if your goal is five to 10 years out, and you\u2019re comfortable taking on some more risk and are willing to accept fluctuations in the market, Bronnenkant said, you might put no more than 30% of your refund in a stock index fund and 70% in a total market bond fund if your risk tolerance is conservative; or 50% in each if you have a moderate risk tolerance. If you plan on sending your child to college and you have a 529 plan, you can use your refund to boost your contributions to that plan, Russ said. You may also get a tax break for your contribution depending on the state where you live. 7. Have some fun Unless you\u2019re in truly dire financial straits, if you get a large refund, you might set aside a small portion to do whatever you truly enjoy. \u201cSometimes you just want to have fun and not have it be all business,\u201d Russ said. \u201cYou can set aside some of the money to have fun.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/15/success/best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "business"}}

The probe is yet another complication for the social media platform, which is already facing the threat of a potential US ban or a forced divestment from its Chinese parent company. The sources said that the FTC is probing TikTok over an alleged violation of the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection rule, which requires companies to notify parents and obtain consent before collecting data from children under 13. The agency is also investigating whether TikTok violated a portion of the FTC Act that prohibits \u201cunfair or deceptive\u201d business practices, the sources said, in denying that TikTok user data could be accessed by individuals in China. The FTC could bring a suit against TikTok or settle with the company in the coming weeks, according to one of the sources. Politico reported news of the probe earlier. When asked about the investigation, FTC Director of Public Affairs Douglas Farrar replied: \u201cNo comment.\u201d TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The FTC probe comes as TikTok faces an existential threat in the US. Earlier this month, a bipartisan group in the US House of Representatives voted to pass a law forcing TikTok to be sold by ByteDance or face a ban from US app stores. The bill is now before the Senate, and President Joe Biden has said he would sign it if it gets to his desk. Senate leaders, however, have indicated they are taking a deliberate approach \u2014\u00a0which could lead to delays or even potentially doom the House bill. The short-form video company, owned by Chinese firm ByteDance, has denied assertions that its app poses a national security threat to US citizens.

Cybersecurity experts say Chinese laws require ByteDance to cooperate with that country\u2019s intelligence demands\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a fact that, given ByteDance\u2019s ownership of TikTok, could hypothetically put US user data at risk. To address that issue, TikTok has taken steps to store its US user data on cloud servers controlled by US tech giant Oracle and established internal protocols limiting access by non-US employees. TikTok acknowledged to Congress in 2022 that employees based in China could access US user data, following a report that year by BuzzFeed News that ByteDance employees had accessed that information on multiple occasions. TikTok CEO Shou Chew, in his first appearance before Congress last year, also acknowledged that several ByteDance employees were fired for spying on certain US journalists as part of a \u201cmisguided attempt\u201d to hunt down leakers within the company.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/ftc-tiktok-probe-privacy-and-security/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_03_26_media_nbc-news-ousts-ronna-mcdaniel", "text": "NBC News on Tuesday ousted former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel, just days after her hiring as a paid political analyst sparked intense backlash from the network\u2019s top television anchors over McDaniel\u2019s role in subverting the 2020 election and attacks on the press. \u201cThere is no doubt that the last several days have been difficult for the News Group,\u201d NBCUniversal News Group President Cesar Conde said in a memo to staff. \u201cAfter listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor.\u201d \u201cI want to personally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down,\u201d Conde continued. \u201cWhile this was a collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team, I approved it and take full responsibility for it.\u201d Ahead of the network\u2019s decision, McDaniel spent the day Tuesday interviewing attorneys in preparation for a potential legal battle with NBC, a person familiar with the matter told CNN. Creative Artists Agency, the talent agency that brokered McDaniel\u2019s deal with NBC, also parted ways with her, the person said. The reversal comes after journalists and anchors at both NBC and its cable news sibling MSNBC publicly denounced the decision to hire McDaniel as a paid analyst in a stunning and unprecedented on-air rebuke of network brass that has embarrassed the Peacock Network. McDaniel, who recently stepped down from the RNC under pressure from former President Donald Trump, was involved in attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. As head of the RNC, she was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d In the years since, McDaniel continued to claim that the election had \u201cproblems\u201d and that Biden did not legitimately win the election, fanning the flames of election denialism. NBC\u2019s announcement Friday that it had hired McDaniel was quickly met with alarm by the network\u2019s journalists. The revolt spilled into public view on Sunday when McDaniel appeared on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with moderator Kristen Welker in her first interview since she was hired by the network. Welker disclosed that the interview had been scheduled to take place prior to NBC announcing McDaniel would become a paid contributor for the network, stating that she had no involvement in her hiring. Following the interview, Chuck Todd, NBC News\u2019 chief political analyst, delivered a stinging on-air criticism of NBC executives for their decision to hire McDaniel, telling Welker, \u201cI think our bosses owe you an apology for putting you in this situation.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a reason a lot of journalists at NBC News are uncomfortable with this,\u201d Todd said, explaining that under McDaniel, the RNC engaged in \u201cgaslighting\u201d and \u201ccharacter assassination\u201d when dealing with the news media. The following day, MSNBC hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough joined Todd in protesting the decision on their program \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d \u201cTo be clear, we believe NBC News should seek out conservative Republican voices to provide balance in their election coverage, but it should be conservative Republicans, not a person who used her position of power to be an anti-democracy election denier,\u201d\u00a0Brzezinski said. \u201cWe hope NBC will reconsider its decision. It goes without saying that she will not be a guest on \u2018Morning Joe\u2019 in her capacity as a paid contributor.\u201d Nicolle Wallace, host of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cDeadline: White House,\u201d later joined in the rebuke, saying on her program that the network\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel was nothing short of a potential threat to democracy. \u201cNBC News is, either wittingly or unwittingly, teaching election deniers that what they can do stretches well beyond appearing on our air and interviews to peddle lies about the sanctity and integrity of our elections,\u201d Wallace told viewers. Rachel Maddow \u2014 the network\u2019s biggest star \u2014 later devoted the first half-hour of her prime-time program to the controversy, saying the decision to hire McDaniel was \u201cinexplicable.\u201d Maddow took issue with McDaniel\u2019s long track record of demonizing the news media, labeling the press as \u201cfake news,\u201d and launching ugly attacks on NBC News journalists and MSNBC hosts. \u201cWe do not take it personally when we get attacked, when they say they want to put us on trial and execute us for treason,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so I want to associate myself with all my colleagues at MSNBC and NBC News who have voiced loud and principled objections to our company for putting on the payroll someone who hasn\u2019t just attacked us as journalists, but someone who is part of an ongoing project to get rid of our system of government,\u201d she said of McDaniel. \u201cSomeone who is still trying to convince Americans that this election stuff doesn\u2019t really work. That this last election wasn\u2019t a real result. That American elections are fraudulent.\u201c The on-air revolt ensnared NBC\u2019s top leaders, including NBCUniversal News Group chair Cesar Conde, NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown, who were responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring. MSNBC president Rashida Jones also did not object to the decision, people familiar with the matter said. In the wake of Conde\u2019s announcement to sever ties with McDaniel, MSNBC host Joy Reid and Maddow addressed the reversal on the network\u2019s air, praising the move as \u201cbold\u201d and \u201cstrong.\u201d \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/media/nbc-news-ousts-ronna-mcdaniel/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_30_tech_elon-musk-byd-china-nightcap", "text": "The most important carmaker in the world right now is the Chinese-owned, Warren Buffett-backed company that has Elon Musk in a pickle. BYD, a carmaker Musk once laughed at, overtook Tesla at the end of last year as the top seller of electric vehicles on the planet (Tesla overtook it in the first quarter of this year, but they\u2019re neck and neck). And now it\u2019s giving Toyota a run for its money, unveiling a new hybrid powertrain that BYD says is capable of taking you from New York to Miami without refueling. That\u2019s 1,300 miles in one go \u2014 hundreds of miles beyond the standard ranges for other hybrids on the market. According to The Wall Street Journal, ranges of major global hybrid carmakers typically top out just above 680 miles. BYD\u2019s Hong Kong shares shot up more than 5% on Wednesday. There are a few reasons why all of that matters. One: Tesla is America\u2019s best-selling EV, but it\u2019s losing market share overseas to foreign competitors that can make their cars cheaper. And while Tesla is an EV pioneer, it hasn\u2019t rolled out any significant innovations in recent years that would help justify its loftier price point. That\u2019s why BYD \u2014 which makes both EVs and hybrids \u2014 is now eating Tesla\u2019s lunch on the global stage. China is the world\u2019s biggest auto market, and BYD is its top seller, surpassing Volkswagen last year. On top of all that, BYD\u2019s sedans are cheap. The two models that will boast the new drivetrain start at around $14,000. (For comparison, the best-selling hybrid in the US, the Toyota Prius, starts at $28,000.) BYD\u2019s evolution from a small producer of clunkers to a global powerhouse brand has surprised its skeptics, including Musk, who roundly dismissed BYD in a 2011 Bloomberg interview. In that exchange, Musk responds to an honest question about BYD rivaling Tesla with a smug laugh. \u201cHave you seen their car?\u201d he asks the interviewer rhetorically. When the reporter presses him, he clarifies that he thinks BYD\u2019s product is not \u201cparticularly attractive\u201d and that the technology is \u201cnot very strong.\u201d Of course, a lot happened in the decade that followed, and Musk ate his words this January, saying on an earnings call that he believes Chinese EV makers could \u201cpretty much demolish most other car companies in the world\u201d unless stronger trade barriers are put in place. (They were two weeks ago.) Meanwhile, BYD has another edge that Tesla lacks: It makes hybrids. Hybrid cars like the Prius were supposed to be the short-lived stepping stone to our all-electric future. But in the United States, at least, EV sales are flagging in part because the nation\u2019s roads lack the infrastructure to support them. EV ranges have come a long way \u2014 most get more than 300 miles of range per charge, which is more than most people would drive before stopping even in a traditional car. Problem is, we don\u2019t have enough charging stations along the roads or within cities to make customers comfortable with the idea. The top reason US customers won\u2019t consider an EV \u2014 cited by 52% of consumers in a recent JD Power survey \u2014 is lack of charging station availability. Instead, we\u2019re buying more hybrids, which are largely cheaper than EVs, reduce the cost of fuel over the long term and are ever so slightly better for the environment than regular engines. (Emphasis on slightly\u2026 Hybrids still run on fossil fuels, they\u2019re not doing much to help the world meet its climate goals the way mass adoption of EVs would.) For now, Tesla and other US carmakers are being thoroughly shielded from Chinese competition via strict tariffs and major regulatory hurdles. But it\u2019s not clear how long those protections will hold if American consumers begin demanding the cheaper options available overseas.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/tech/elon-musk-byd-china-nightcap/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "business"}}

You can sign up\u00a0right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link. Buying or selling a stock is about to get a lot snappier starting next Tuesday. But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019ll get smoother, at least right away \u2014 and some financial firms are preparing to handle any possible bumpiness. The current standard settlement cycle for broker-dealer transactions is \u201cT+2.\u201d That means that it takes two business days from when you buy a stock to when that transaction \u201csettles,\u201d or when the stock is officially transferred to the buyer\u2019s account and cash is delivered to the seller\u2019s account. That\u2019s been the norm since 2017. Starting May 28, that cycle will take just one business day, or \u201cT+1.\u201d \u201cFor everyday investors who sell their stock on a Monday, shortening the settlement cycle will allow them to get their money on Tuesday,\u201d Gary Gensler, chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said in a press release. \u201cIt will make our market plumbing more resilient, timely and orderly.\u201d These new rules will apply to stocks, bonds, municipal securities, exchange-traded funds, some mutual funds and limited partnerships that trade on an exchange. Broker-dealers and registered investment advisors will also have to follow new recordkeeping rules. Some investors say that a shorter cycle should help free up more liquidity in the market and reduce volatility in margins \u2014 the collateral traders have to show \u2014 since it reduces the chance of default before the transaction goes through. Clearinghouses, which sit between buyers and sellers, collect margins from traders as evidence that they can afford to make the transaction. \u201cAssuming everything goes well and we don\u2019t see any hiccups, the move towards T+1 will be an overall benefit to our ecosystem, institutional investors and retail [investors],\u201d said Rich Lee, head of program trading and execution strategy at Baird. Baird has had a T+1 committee in place since last summer to ensure such hiccups don\u2019t happen, Lee said. Employees have been in discussions with clients about how to assist them through the process. The company has also staffed up to handle their part in clearing trades with a shorter time frame. The shortened settlement cycle is partly in response to the 2021 meme stock frenzy, when investors on Reddit sent shares of GameStop and AMC Entertainment soaring to eye-popping heights in a short span of time. (Meme stocks typically trade less on fundamentals and more on social media frenzy.)  Robinhood and other brokerages in 2021 temporarily suspended buying of GameStop, AMC and other stocks on its platform, blaming in part the T+2 rule that pushed up collateral requirements imposed on brokers like Robinhood. Investors were left waiting for their trades and brokers with their cash locked up until the settlement, unable to allow more purchasing to ensure they had enough funds to cover the trades. \u201cThe existing two-day period to settle trades exposes investors and the industry to unnecessary risk and is ripe for change,\u201d Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev said in a February 2021 release. \u201cThere is no reason why the greatest financial system the world has ever seen cannot settle trades in real time.\u201d Boeing on track to meet FAA deadline to present quality control fixes Boeing will present its plan to fix quality problems with its assembly line to US regulators next week, the company said Thursday. The plan was ordered up by the Federal Aviation Administration in late February after a hole blew open in the side of an airborne 737 Max a month earlier, reports my colleague Gregory Wallace. The FAA said it audited the production line at Boeing and its key 737 Max supplier and found \u201cmultiple instances where the companies allegedly failed to comply with manufacturing quality control requirements.\u201d It gave Boeing 90 days to present a plan \u2014 and that deadline is next week. Boeing chief financial officer Brian West said Thursday that Boeing and the FAA have had \u201clots of dialogue\u201d including two check-ins during the preparation of the plan. \u201cThe engagement is constructive,\u201d he said at a conference organized by Wolfe Research on Thursday. \u201cI expect next week we\u2019re going to get some good feedback.\u201d FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker said separately on Thursday that the plan is \u201cnot the end of the process, it\u2019s the beginning.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a long road to get back to where they need to be making safe airplanes,\u201d Whitaker said in an interview on ABC News.

Meta created an AI advisory council that\u2019s composed entirely of White men Meta this week appointed a group of outside advisors to provide guidance on its artificial intelligence strategy. The four-person advisory group is composed entirely of White men, reports my colleague Clare Duffy. The tech giant said the group, which includes tech entrepreneurs and investors, will periodically consult with Meta\u2019s management \u201con strategic opportunities related to our technology and product roadmap.\u201d The move comes as Meta plans to invest tens of billions of dollars this year in AI infrastructure, research and product development. The council includes Patrick Collison, the co-founder and chief executive of financial technology company Stripe; Nat Friedman, the tech investor and former CEO of GitHub; Tobi L\u00fctke, the founder and CEO of online shopping firm Shopify; and Charlie Songhurst, the tech investor who formerly led corporate strategy and drove several key acquisitions at Microsoft. A Meta spokesperson confirmed the group will not be paid. Despite the group\u2019s significant combined experience, Meta is already taking heat for failing to include women or people of color \u2014 or anyone else outside of the wealthy, White, male, Silicon Valley mold \u2014 in a group advising one of the world\u2019s most powerful tech companies on a revolutionary new technology. The members of the group are also all in their 30s or 40s. The situation mirrors an incident last year at OpenAI when, in the wake of a leadership shakeup, it came under fire for appointing a board composed entirely of White men. Months later, OpenAI added three women directors to the board.

{"id": "2024_05_29_investing_graceland-scam", "text": "In yet another twist in the bizarre story of the dubious foreclosure threat against Elvis Presley\u2019s iconic Memphis home, a person purporting to be involved in a scheme to steal Graceland responded to an email from CNN, claiming responsibility for the scam. \u201cI didn\u2019t win this one. I\u2019ve stole (sic) many identities and received monies, we don\u2019t win all,\u201d wrote the self-proclaimed scammer in a mixture of English and Luganda, a language spoken by more than 5 million people primarily in Uganda, according to the United Nations. As with all scammers, it\u2019s unclear whether the person who emailed CNN is actually behind the scheme. But they responded to a CNN request for comment sent to an email address associated with Naussany Investments and Private Lending, a company that tried to foreclose on the famous mansion last week. Graceland was set to go up for auction under the pretext that the late singer\u2019s daughter, Lisa Marie Presley, who died in 2023, failed to pay back a $3.8 million loan she\u2019d secured from\u00a0 Naussany Investments before her passing, and had used Graceland as collateral, according to court documents. But actress Riley Keough, Elvis\u2019 granddaughter and heir, sued to protect the estate from the auction block, alleging fraud and saying Naussany didn\u2019t exist and had no rights to the property. The foreclosure sale was ultimately blocked, and Naussany Investments dropped its foreclosure efforts. A self-proclaimed scam artist CNN reached out to the email address listed as the company representative in Keough\u2019s lawsuit for comment. That person said his company had no claims against anyone affiliated with Graceland and directed CNN to a different email address \u2013 gregoryenaussanyniplflorida@hotmail.com \u2013 supposedly belonging to a person named Gregory Naussany, who responded when contacted by CNN. Other news outlets, including the New York Times, which first reported on the alleged scammer\u2019s admission Tuesday, received similar messages from the same email address. A Luganda-speaking native translated and reviewed the email for CNN. When asked whether the self-proclaimed scammer appeared to be a native speaker or was perhaps using a tool like Google Translate to pose as one, the translator found that while the apparent scammer knew the language, their writing style showed they were not entirely fluent. CNN has been unable to find any evidence to prove the company actually exists. The phone number listed in court documents was not in service. The business was listed in a court document as being located in Kimberling City, Missouri. But the secretary of state had no record of a business by that name when contacted by CNN. The Shelby County Registrar told CNN in an email that \u201cNaussany Investments & Private Lending, LLC, does not have any filings in the Office of the Shelby County Register of Deeds pertaining to Graceland/Elvis Presley.\u201d The self-identified scammer told the New York Times they are based in Nigeria and targeted groups including the dead and elderly. They especially went after victims in Florida and California, using sensitive documents like birth certificates to facilitate their schemes, according to the Times article. \u201cWe use innocents and we steal identity,\u201d said the scammer in an email to CNN. What would lead a scammer to go after the second most visited residence in the US behind the White House remains unknown. \u201cWe figure out how to steal,\u201d the scammer told the Times. \u201cThat\u2019s what we do.\u201d It was a mistake to target Graceland, said Mark Sunderman, a real estate professor at the University of Memphis. \u201cWhy they went after such a high-profile piece of property, that was just very stupid,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, in terms of Memphis, I can\u2019t think of anything more high profile other than if they tried to go after the Civil Rights Museum.\u201d Court documents show Naussany Investments offered to settle its claimed debt with the Presley estate for $2.85 million, a reduction of $950,000 from the original loan.\u00a0 Sunderman believes that quick payoff may have been the scammer\u2019s goal, not a successful foreclosure on Graceland. \u201cIf they had gone through the foreclosure sale, they would have had much, much greater risk to get caught and had less payoff to them in the long run,\u201d he said. Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti last Thursday said he was looking into possible fraud involving the matter. The Shelby County District Attorney did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on any possible criminal case.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/investing/graceland-scam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "business"}}

The agency made its announcement after the Japanese automaker issued a warning on Wednesday telling vehicle\u00a0owners\u00a0not to drive certain\u00a0vehicles\u00a0- the 2002-2006 model year\u00a0Nissan\u00a0Sentra, 2002-2004\u00a0Nissan\u00a0Pathfinder and 2002-2003 Infiniti QX4 - that were recalled in 2020 but have not been fixed. \u201cIf you have one of these\u00a0vehicles, do not drive it until the repair\u00a0is completed and the defective\u00a0air\u00a0bag\u00a0is replaced,\u201d NHTSA said in a statement, noting that\u00a0Nissan\u00a0dealers are offering free towing, mobile repair\u00a0and in some places loaner\u00a0vehicles.

More than 30 deaths worldwide - including 27 in the United States - and more than 400 injuries have been reported since 2009 in\u00a0vehicles\u00a0sold by various\u00a0automakers due to Takata\u00a0air\u00a0bag\u00a0inflators that can explode, unleashing metal shrapnel inside cars and trucks. The\u00a0air\u00a0bag\u00a0problems have been blamed on propellant that can break down after long-term exposure to high-temperature fluctuations and humidity.

{"id": "2024_03_20_success_interest-rates-savings-cash", "text": "The Federal Reserve\u2019s benchmark interest rate remains at a 23-year high. That\u2019s thanks to the central bank\u2019s decision Wednesday to once again hold it steady, as it has done at the policy-making committee\u2019s past five meetings. That decision may be disappointing to some investors, homebuyers and those with a lot of credit card debt, since movement in the Fed\u2019s overnight lending rate influences rates \u2014 directly or indirectly \u2014 on consumer financial products (e.g., credit cards, bank loans and mortgages). But\u00a0with the Fed signaling that no rate cuts are likely until summer, it also means anyone with savings still has at least a few more months to make hay of their stash. That\u2019s because you can still get inflation-beating interest rates that will grow any money you have set aside for emergencies, vacations, down payments or any other goal in your sights over the next several years. However, that won\u2019t happen if you just let it sit in a traditional checking or savings account that yields next to nothing. There are more lucrative, low-risk options out there, with rates that are still at or near their peaks. \u201cBut perhaps not for much longer,\u201d said Ted Rossman, senior analyst at Bankrate. \u201cIf one of those fits into your financial plans, it\u2019s best to act soon.\u201d So, consider the following options when deciding where to park your hard-earned savings. High-yield online savings accounts The average annual percentage yield on bank savings accounts was just 0.52% as of March 13, according to Bankrate. That average is kept low by the biggest brick-and-mortar banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, which still are offering a paltry 0.01%. By contrast, there are still FDIC-insured online banks offering inflation-beating rates of between 4.35% and 5.35% on their high-yield savings accounts. Generally speaking, these are the best vehicles in which to keep your emergency funds for quick, easy access. Choosing between an account that pays 0.52% and one that pays 5.35% can mean forfeiting hundreds of dollars in interest. \u201cIf you put $10,000 in a savings account, that\u2019s a difference of $496 in interest earnings over the course of the year, assuming monthly compounding,\u201d Rossman said. While the rates on high-yield savings accounts have gone down a bit in recent months, \u201cwidespread cuts in online savings account rates are unlikely until the first Fed rate cut is near,\u201d said Ken Tumin, founder of DepositAccounts.com. As with any bank savings rate, high-yield savings account\u00a0rates\u00a0can change overnight, and the bank may not alert you when it lowers it. So make sure to check your monthly statement. Certificates of deposits Another high-return, low-risk investment that is great for money you likely won\u2019t need to tap for a few months or even a couple of years is a certificate of deposit. You can get the best returns on CDs through a brokerage such as Schwab, E*Trade or Fidelity. That\u2019s because you can comparison shop for CDs from any number of FDIC-insured banks and will not have to set up individual accounts with each institution. As of March 13, the average rate on a one-year CD was 1.95%, but some banks are offering as much are 5.4%. If you can get a one-year CD at, say, 5.4%, you will make $540 on a $10,000 investment. To get the greatest benefit from a CD, you have to leave the money invested for a fixed period. You can always access your principal sooner if you need to, but there may be early withdrawal penalties. As of March 20, CDs listed on Schwab.com with durations from three months up to three years were all yielding between 5.2% and 5.51%. CD rates on durations between four and 10 years ranged from 4.40% to 5.15%. Say you invest $10,000 in a one-year CD with a 5.36%\u00a0APY. At the end of that period, you\u2019d get your principal back plus $536 in interest when the CD matures, according to Bankrate\u2019s CD calculator. If you chose a two-year CD at 5.25%, you\u2019d bank an extra $1,078, assuming compounding interest. The same investment in a five-year CD at 5.15% would earn $2,854. \u201cIt makes sense to go long with CDs. To hedge your bets, include terms from one to five years. Starting a CD ladder will provide this mix,\u201d Tumin said. If you don\u2019t go through a brokerage you may get a reasonable deal from your primary bank, Tumin said. For example, he noted, Wells Fargo is still offering up to 5.01% on both 4-month and 7-month CDs. Or, at Bank of America, you can get up to 4.75% on a 7-month CD. But Tumin cautions that with any big bank CD you should take your money out at the end of the term, otherwise your bank may automatically renew it and lock you in to a much lower-yielding CD. Money market accounts and funds If you don\u2019t want to set up an online savings account at another bank, your own bank may offer you a money market deposit account that pays a higher yield than your regular checking or savings accounts. Money market accounts may have higher minimum deposit requirements than a regular savings account, but they are more liquid than a fixed-term certificate of deposit or Treasury bill, meaning they give you access to your money more quickly while still potentially giving you some of the highest yields available, said Doug Ornstein, senior manager for integrated solutions at TIAA Wealth Management. But don\u2019t confuse money market accounts with money market mutual funds, which invest in short-term, low-risk debt instruments. As of March 19, they had an average 7-day yield of 5.14%, according to the Crane Money Fund Index, which tracks the top 100 taxable money market funds. Unlike money market deposit accounts, money market mutual funds are not insured by the FDIC. But if you invest in a money market fund through a brokerage, your overall account is likely to be insured through the Securities Investor Protection Corp, which offers protection in the event your brokerage ever goes under. Treasury bills and notes Another option for money you can leave untouched anywhere from several months to a few years is to buy short-term Treasury bills and medium-term notes, which are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. Three- and six-month bills had yields of 5.39% and 5.33%\u00a0respectively on March 20 before the Fed\u2019s meeting ended, while nine-month and one-year bills were offering 5.19% and 5.08%\u00a0respectively, according to rates posted on Schwab.com for a $25,000 investment. Rates on Treasury notes with durations from two years to 10 years ranged between 4.29% and 4.72%. If you\u2019re someone who manages your portfolio like a hawk, you may feel comfortable buying T-bills on your own from TreasuryDirect.gov. But if you don\u2019t, it might be easier just to buy new issues through your brokerage account or invest in a short-term bond index fund or ETF, said Andy Smith, executive director of financial planning at Edelman Financial Engines. And if you\u2019re looking at money that will be needed in three to five years, you might consider a diversified fund of highly rated government and corporate bonds, Ornstein said. An 18-month AAA-rated corporate bond, for instance, was yielding 4.82% this week, while the three-year was at 4.49%. Meanwhile, three-year AAA-rated municipal bonds (which are issued by local governments) had a rate of 3.98%, according to Schwab.com. Don\u2019t chase yield When deciding on the best accounts and investments for your specific goals and peace of mind, it may pay to consult a fee-only fiduciary adviser \u2014 meaning, someone who doesn\u2019t get paid a commission to sell you a particular investment. What you\u2019ll always want to do is build in flexibility for yourself so you can easily access cash, regardless of your timeline for key goals. \u201cWhat happens if something changes and you need that down payment a lot sooner \u2014 or your parents need medical care fast?\u201d Smith said. That means balancing your desire for great yield with a need and desire for ease of access without penalty. Translation: Don\u2019t chase yield for yield\u2019s sake. Think of it this way, Ornstein said: Unless you have huge sums to invest or are an institutional investor, the difference between getting a 5.1% yield versus 5% is negligible, and in fact it could even cost you more if there are penalties for taking your money out early. \u201cMost of the time convenience is really important. Give up the 0.1%,\u201d he advised.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/20/success/interest-rates-savings-cash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_01_tech_aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl", "text": "A London-based technology company is looking to \u201cdemocratize\u201d talent-identification and scouting in soccer using a mobile app. Free to download and available globally, the aiScout app allows aspiring soccer stars to enter virtual trials for professional clubs by uploading self-recorded footage of themselves completing a series of drills. It offers 75 exercises, designed to test a range of skills, with videos showing users how to complete them. Performances are automatically scored by artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The data can then be accessed by clubs, allowing their scouts to peruse scores for viable talent, honing their search with a variety of filters; from age and gender to position on the pitch. The app currently has two English Premier League (EPL) partners, Chelsea and Burnley, and clubs can tailor their in-app trials to meet specific needs and set their own benchmarks by having their academy players complete the same drills. \u201cWe\u2019re putting that data up front to make better use of [the scouts\u2019] time,\u201d said Richard Felton-Thomas, chief operating officer of ai.io, the company behind the app. \u201cTo say [to scouts], \u2018Go over to this place today because there\u2019s three players in that game that are all actually beating your Chelsea standard\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s going to be the best use of your time.\u2019\u201d It already appears to be working for some. Ben Greenwood had never had a trial with a professional club until he downloaded the app in 2019. After uploading footage of himself, the 17-year-old landed a trial with Chelsea, becoming the first user of the app to get a trial with a pro club. He signed a contract\u00a0with EPL team Bournemouth\u00a0in 2021. \u2018It\u2019s more about evolution\u2019 Having beta-tested in with players spanning 125 countries, Greenwood among them, 135 players have been trialed or signed by pro clubs or national teams through the app \u2014 which fully launched in September 2023 \u2014 according to Felton-Thomas. Just over 100,000 players make up the current database, but with over 100 clubs lined up to join Chelsea and Burnley, as well as a multi-year partnership with Major League Soccer in the US announced last May, Felton-Thomas projects user numbers to surge into the millions as the operation ramps up this year. Felton-Thomas said the \u201clion\u2019s share\u201d of its income comes from charging clubs a license fee to run the platform. Annual fees vary depending on the size of the club and the tools they require, ranging from six figures for \u201ctier one\u201d sides like Chelsea, to thousands of pounds for clubs lower down the footballing pyramid. The use of smart technology in sport continues to expand, including\u00a0AI commentary tools and wearable tech for elite athletes. The global market for sports analytics, valued at\u00a0$2.7 billion\u00a0in 2023, is projected to grow 22% by the end of the decade, according to market research firm Grand View Research. Should soccer talent scouts be concerned about being edged out by the arrival of AI in their industry? For Felton-Thomas, new technologies can co-exist with traditional methods. \u201cIt\u2019s more about evolution than revolution,\u201d Felton-Thomas explained. \u201cWe can\u2019t tell you when that player\u2019s actually in that match, how does he deal with adversity? What happens when he\u2019s 2-0 down? What happens when someone\u2019s shouting at him? What happens when he\u2019s just made a massive mistake?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got the ability to just augment real people to do their jobs better and faster, which then gives an opportunity to the player through the AI, but you\u2019re still actually just connecting them to the human on the other side, which is the club and the scout.\u201d While football remains ai.io\u2019s primary focus, the company is looking into opportunities in other sports to launch in the coming years. Further ahead, it may branch out beyond sports. \u201cYou think about the notion that you can be at home and analyze your movements, and how this could spin into health care, physical assessments for military disciplines and emergency services,\u201d Felton-Thomas told CNN.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/01/tech/aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "business"}}
