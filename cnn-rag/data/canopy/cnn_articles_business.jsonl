{"id": "2024_03_01_tech_aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl", "text": "A London-based technology company is looking to \u201cdemocratize\u201d talent-identification and scouting in soccer using a mobile app. Free to download and available globally, the aiScout app allows aspiring soccer stars to enter virtual trials for professional clubs by uploading self-recorded footage of themselves completing a series of drills. It offers 75 exercises, designed to test a range of skills, with videos showing users how to complete them. Performances are automatically scored by artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The data can then be accessed by clubs, allowing their scouts to peruse scores for viable talent, honing their search with a variety of filters; from age and gender to position on the pitch. The app currently has two English Premier League (EPL) partners, Chelsea and Burnley, and clubs can tailor their in-app trials to meet specific needs and set their own benchmarks by having their academy players complete the same drills. \u201cWe\u2019re putting that data up front to make better use of [the scouts\u2019] time,\u201d said Richard Felton-Thomas, chief operating officer of ai.io, the company behind the app. \u201cTo say [to scouts], \u2018Go over to this place today because there\u2019s three players in that game that are all actually beating your Chelsea standard\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s going to be the best use of your time.\u2019\u201d It already appears to be working for some. Ben Greenwood had never had a trial with a professional club until he downloaded the app in 2019. After uploading footage of himself, the 17-year-old landed a trial with Chelsea, becoming the first user of the app to get a trial with a pro club. He signed a contract\u00a0with EPL team Bournemouth\u00a0in 2021. \u2018It\u2019s more about evolution\u2019 Having beta-tested in with players spanning 125 countries, Greenwood among them, 135 players have been trialed or signed by pro clubs or national teams through the app \u2014 which fully launched in September 2023 \u2014 according to Felton-Thomas. Just over 100,000 players make up the current database, but with over 100 clubs lined up to join Chelsea and Burnley, as well as a multi-year partnership with Major League Soccer in the US announced last May, Felton-Thomas projects user numbers to surge into the millions as the operation ramps up this year. Felton-Thomas said the \u201clion\u2019s share\u201d of its income comes from charging clubs a license fee to run the platform. Annual fees vary depending on the size of the club and the tools they require, ranging from six figures for \u201ctier one\u201d sides like Chelsea, to thousands of pounds for clubs lower down the footballing pyramid. The use of smart technology in sport continues to expand, including\u00a0AI commentary tools and wearable tech for elite athletes. The global market for sports analytics, valued at\u00a0$2.7 billion\u00a0in 2023, is projected to grow 22% by the end of the decade, according to market research firm Grand View Research. Should soccer talent scouts be concerned about being edged out by the arrival of AI in their industry? For Felton-Thomas, new technologies can co-exist with traditional methods. \u201cIt\u2019s more about evolution than revolution,\u201d Felton-Thomas explained. \u201cWe can\u2019t tell you when that player\u2019s actually in that match, how does he deal with adversity? What happens when he\u2019s 2-0 down? What happens when someone\u2019s shouting at him? What happens when he\u2019s just made a massive mistake?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got the ability to just augment real people to do their jobs better and faster, which then gives an opportunity to the player through the AI, but you\u2019re still actually just connecting them to the human on the other side, which is the club and the scout.\u201d While football remains ai.io\u2019s primary focus, the company is looking into opportunities in other sports to launch in the coming years. Further ahead, it may branch out beyond sports. \u201cYou think about the notion that you can be at home and analyze your movements, and how this could spin into health care, physical assessments for military disciplines and emergency services,\u201d Felton-Thomas told CNN.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/01/tech/aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "business"}}

Fifty thousand women in 22 districts across the states of Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Gujarat received a $5 payments as temperatures topped 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) last month in several parts of the country. \u201cThis is the first time that insurance payouts and a direct cash assistance program have been combined to supplement the income of women when it\u2019s dangerously hot,\u201d said\u00a0Kathy Baughman McLeod, CEO of Climate Resilience for All, a not-for-profit organization that designed the insurance in partnership with India\u2019s Self-Employed Women\u2019s Association (SEWA), a trade union with nearly three million members. From small farmers to casual laborers, many SEWA members depend on agriculture for their livelihoods, and that makes them particularly vulnerable to climate change. Indian women working in agriculture typically earn about 300 rupees ($3.60) per day. Outdoor work in such extreme heat can lead to chronic rashes, dizziness, burns, infections, and miscarriage, according to Climate Resilience for All. Such high temperatures can also destroy crops or merchandise, which can have a debilitating impact on household debt for low-income families. The insurance is underwritten by Swiss Re and provided locally by ICICI Lombard. More than 46,000 women were given additional insurance payments, with some receiving up to $19.80 each. Overall payments across the program amounted to over $340,000, Climate Resilience for All said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cThe money from the program has allowed me to pay for my medical expenses and to buy food for my family,\u201d said Arunaben Makwana, one of the beneficiaries, said in the statement. The insurance plan is currently offered to members of SEWA, who work across India\u2019s vast informal sector. According to McLeod, the program may be rolled out to more communities across South Asia, as well as east and west Africa in the coming year. Toiling under the burning sun Such insurance initiatives may become critical worldwide as policymakers grapple with a much hotter planet. India has endured a scorching summer \u2014 with a part of the capital of Delhi recording the country\u2019s highest-ever temperature of 49.9 degrees Celsius (121.8 Fahrenheit) last month. Rising mercury levels in the country risks reversing progress on poverty alleviation, health and economic growth, experts say.

{"id": "2024_06_12_economy_inflation-real-time-data", "text": "If you want to know how much a publicly traded company is worth at any given time, all you have to do is look up its market cap, which updates in real time during trading hours. But if you want to know how fast prices are rising in the US, you get two official updates a month \u2014 the Consumer Price Index and the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index. Both come with a lag, can be revised several months later and can even be indefinitely delayed in the event of a government shutdown, as was almost the case with September\u2019s inflation data. Despite these shortcomings, officials at the Federal Reserve rely on these government reports to help make crucial monetary policy decisions that directly influence the interest rates you pay on your mortgage and other kinds of debt. The inflation rate the government arrives at also impacts how much you receive in Social Security benefits and likely is a factor in determining your pay. But a novel real-time inflation gauge called Truflation is trying to fix some of the issues with government inflation data that has long been considered the gold standard. While it\u2019s valuable to have regularly updated inflation data, Truflation doesn\u2019t have as much access to certain categories the government data tracks, namely education and health care prices, two big expenses for many Americans. The government also has a much longer history of producing inflation reports with extremely thorough standards. How it works Unlike PCE and CPI, Truflation arrives at a new inflation rate on a near-daily basis, drawing from over 60 different data sources that provide three unique prices across more than 18 million goods and services. Some of the data providers include Amazon, Walmart, Nielsen, Hilton and Zillow. While the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the division of the Labor Department that produces monthly CPI reports, enlists a team of people to either physically go to businesses, call them up or scan websites to collect pricing data for 80,000 goods and services across the country, Truflation pays for some of the data. Over time, more providers have been sharing data for free because they recognize that having it incorporated into the model will give them more updated and accurate information on how competitive their pricing is, Stefan Rust, CEO and founder of Truflation, told CNN. That data goes through a rigorous process incorporating blockchain technology to verify its authenticity, which Truflation outlines in its public 20-page methodology. Like PCE and CPI, Truflation assigns relative importance values to categories to mirror how an average consumer\u2019s income is allocated. For most consumers, housing accounts for the majority of their spending, and is therefore assigned a greater weight than, for instance, clothing. That\u2019s why small increases in the cost of housing can end up having big impacts on the overall inflation rate. Truflation uses the same process the government does to calculate relative importance, but it uses some different data to determine how consumers allocate their income. That accounts for some of the variation between the government\u2019s inflation data and Truflation\u2019s. Another discrepancy is that Truflation\u2019s data is not seasonally adjusted, whereas the government\u2019s monthly data is. That means that an increase in utility prices during the summer when it\u2019s typically more expensive to cool your home would show up more in Truflation\u2019s data than the government\u2019s. As of Wednesday, Truflation put the nation\u2019s annual inflation rate at 2.23%, just inches away from the Fed\u2019s 2% target. In contrast, May\u2019s CPI report released Wednesday morning arrived at a 3.3% inflation rate, matching precisely what Truflation predicted the gauge would come in at based on its data. Truflation is able to predict what government inflation reports will show by adjusting their data to when the government goes out and collects its own pricing data to form its monthly reports. How Truflation data is being used Wall Street traders were the first group drawn to Truflation, Rust said. \u201cThey wanted the data to help them calculate where they felt, based on our data, the government BLS numbers would come out on.\u201d Danielle DiMartino Booth, who advised\u00a0Richard Fisher\u00a0when he was the president of the Dallas Fed and who is now CEO and chief strategist at QI Research, said she uses Truflation \u201cto identify where price pressures are cropping up\u201d on a daily basis. That gives her a \u201cbetter feel\u201d of what\u2019s happening on the ground versus the government\u2019s data, Booth told CNN. While Fed officials have taken a greater interest in analyzing economic data from non-government sources to help shape their views on the economy, it remains to be seen if and how they\u2019re using Truflation data. But it\u2019s on their radar, said Rust, who says he has met with researchers from the New York and Dallas Fed.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/economy/inflation-real-time-data/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "business"}}

The level of capsaicin found in Buldak Hot Chicken Ramen 3x Spicy, Buldak Hot Chicken Ramen 2x Spicy and Hot Chicken Stew was so high that it could poison consumers, the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration said in a statement issued Tuesday. Capsaicin is a spicy, naturally occurring chemical found in chili peppers. South Korean noodle giant Samyang, which developed the ramen, said on Wednesday that the products were not being recalled because of quality issues. It\u2019s \u201cbecause it is so spicy that it could cause problems,\u201d a spokesperson told CNN. \u201cThis is the first time they\u2019ve been subject to (a) recall for this reason.\u201d The Danish regulator didn\u2019t say whether the recall was prompted by a specific incident. It urged consumers to discard the products or return them to where they were purchased. Instant noodles originated in Japan but have become a staple across Asia. Samyang bills itself as having produced South Korea\u2019s first instant ramen in 1963, when the country was mired in post-war poverty and needed cheap, accessible sources of food. Samyang was the country\u2019s third largest noodle maker after Ottugi and Nongshim by sales in 2022, the latest year for which information was available, according to NICE Information Service, a research firm. Buldak, which means \u201cfire chicken\u201d in Korean, was developed by Samyang\u2019s chief executive, Kim Jung-soo, a housewife who married into the family business and eventually took over. She told The Wall Street Journal in January that she was inspired by a spicy stir fry. The noodles were launched in 2012 and popularized on social media by influencers touting the \u201cFire Noodles Challenge.\u201d In March, rapper Cardi B reignited the craze with a TikTok video.

{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_judges-stern-rebuke-of-elon-musks-x-gives-researchers-fresh-hope", "text": "A federal judge\u2019s decision this week reprimanding Elon Musk\u2019s X will have reverberating effects on efforts to hold influential online platforms accountable, legal experts and advocacy groups say. On Monday, District Judge Charles Breyer dismissed and excoriated a lawsuit by X against online watchdog group Center for Countering Digital Hate as an attempt to silence the non-profit group for sounding alarms about hate speech on the platform. Breyer wrote in Monday\u2019s order that the lawsuit was \u201cunabashedly\u201d about \u201cpunishing\u201d reports written by CCDH, which X had accused of campaigning to drive away its advertisers. Breyer held that the reports were \u201cunquestionably\u201d protected by the group\u2019s free speech rights. Now, that decision could embolden other research groups and Musk critics who have faced legal threats from the billionaire. The CCDH case \u2014 in the US District Court for the Northern District of California \u2014\u00a0has been widely viewed as a bellwether for research and accountability on X, where Musk has restored the accounts of previously banned White supremacists and spreaders of misinformation and where Musk himself has amplified various conspiracy theories. And CCDH is not the only organization that has faced attacks by self-proclaimed \u201cfree speech absolutist\u201d Musk after criticizing or raising concerns about his platform. \u201cThis is an important decision that sees Elon Musk\u2019s lawsuit for what it is \u2014 an effort to punish his critics for constitutionally protected speech and to deter researchers from studying his platform,\u201d said Alex Abdo, litigation director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, which had filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the case arguing that private companies should not be allowed to use breach of contract claims to punish criticism. \u201cSociety needs reliable and ethical research into social media platforms, and often that research relies on being able to study publicly available posts,\u201d Abdo said. X said it plans to appeal Breyer\u2019s decision. Musk\u2019s threats against X critics In his first year as owner of X, formerly known as Twitter, Musk threatened legal action against the Anti-Defamation League for defamation, as well as against Microsoft and Meta for allegedly improper data and trade secret access, respectively. None of those threats ever amounted to real lawsuits. He did, however, sue the progressive media watchdog Media Matters over its\u00a0analysis\u00a0highlighting antisemitic and pro-Nazi content on X, alleging that the group\u2019s testing methodology was not representative of how real users experience the site and that the report was designed to drive away advertisers. Legal experts have described that case as \u201cweak\u201d on the merits and as a \u201cbogus\u201d attempt to chill criticism of X. This week\u2019s court decision may be only a temporary setback in Musk\u2019s wider plan to stifle criticism, said Media Matters CEO Angelo Carusone. Musk\u2019s new playbook, Carusone said, enlists the help of sympathetic Republican attorneys general to investigate independent reporting organizations and tie them up in legal proceedings. The states of Texas and Missouri each announced probes into Media Matters following X\u2019s lawsuit against the group, to which Musk responded, \u201cGreat!\u201d As recently as Monday, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey filed a petition in state court seeking to compel Media Matters\u2019 cooperation with his investigation. The filing came a week after he appeared with Musk in a live event on X \u2014 which Carusone said shows how Musk hopes to deputize the power of government to silence his critics. \u201cThey have every reason to do it,\u201d Carusone said of the AGs\u2019 investigations. \u201cThey get the political benefits, they get the attention. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any cost to them yet. And if they are successful at developing this new playbook, this new terrain, legally, then it\u2019s going to pave the way for them to just use this tool and tactic over and over and over again.\u201d A representative for X did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Carusone\u2019s claims. Researchers face hurdles to studying on-platform behavior Researchers from non-profits and academic institutions have had a harder time studying X since Musk\u2019s takeover in 2022. Academics need large samples of posts, shares, likes and other data to study social media trends in mis- and disinformation, public health, elections and other key topics. But one of Musk\u2019s first changes at X was to put access to platform data behind a steep paywall. Researchers and civil society groups said the new subscription fees \u2014 costing up to $2.5 million a year \u2014\u00a0were \u201coutrageously expensive\u201d and made it impossible to do their work, reducing transparency of a critical platform. The change may have forced some researchers to rely more heavily on first-person observational data to draw conclusions about user behavior on X. Groups like CCDH have also used automated \u201cscraping\u201d of publicly viewable content from X rather than paying the company for data directly, a tactic that helped give rise to X\u2019s initial lawsuit. Efforts by X and other social media companies to limit research transparency makes them less accountable to the public at best and, at worst, could mask malicious behavior, said David Karpf, an associate professor in the School of Media and Public Affairs at George Washington University. \u201cWe need independent research to have any real measure of what\u2019s going on at X/Twitter. Musk is only ever going to release data that makes his company look good,\u201d Karpf said. \u201cThese platforms are too big and too vital to the spread of information to be left unmonitored.\u201d \u201cThis is an election year,\u201d Karpf added, \u201cand the platforms are taking steps to make it harder to monitor how their services are used for malignant ends.\u201d Free Press, another media accountability organization that has been critical of Musk\u2019s leadership of X and which called for advertisers to pause their spending on the platform shortly after his takeover, also celebrated Breyer\u2019s ruling as potentially removing at least one hurdle that watchdog organizations face. \u201cThe guardrails for democracy are hanging by a thread and we have dwindling insights into platform practices as researchers face lawsuits, congressional subpoenas and other scare tactics,\u201d said Nora Benavidez, senior counsel and director of digital rights at Free Press. Ultimately, Benavidez called the ruling \u201ca reminder that platform accountability is essential and will inevitably prevail when up against bullies like Musk who try to silence us.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/judges-stern-rebuke-of-elon-musks-x-gives-researchers-fresh-hope/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "business"}}

The term refers to one-stop-shop apps that allow for messaging, ordering food, payment processing and other capabilities all within one platform.  According to Dipanjan Chatterjee, a principal analyst at market research firm Forrester, super apps most threaten Apple\u2019s preeminence in the lives of its customers. \u201cAn offering like WeChat, dubbed China\u2019s everything app, can provide an alternative to the Apple ecosystem for people to communicate, bank, share memories, talk to businesses and more,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cWhat Apple fears most is becoming irrelevant to its customers.\u201d At the same time, super apps like WeChat are created by larger companies and could, therefore, put some smaller companies at a disadvantage. And the concept hasn\u2019t been welcomed much in the US anyway. The US government, however, could argue that lack of interest may be due to Apple\u2019s high share of the smartphone market and its resistance to offer super apps in its store, Chatterjee said. Better interoperability Apple may also be required to offer more support for cross-platform messaging, an issue the company previously said it\u2019s already working on. The company lets iPhone users send high-quality photos and videos to one another, but similar texts to Android phones are slower and grainy. It also maintains those messages in green bubbles, creating a kind of class divide, critics argue. In November, the company said it will add new features, such as read receipts, typing indicators, better support for group chats and higher quality media sharing of images and videos, across platforms to help close the gap. Apple\u2019s move to add support for the standard called RCS (rich communication services) is intended to roll out later this year. RCS is considered the replacement to alternatives such as SMS, or short messaging service, and can work over both Wi-Fi and mobile data. The change followed pressure from both regulators and competitors to more seamlessly work across operating systems. The European Union\u2019s Digital Markets Act, for example, requires companies to make their key services interoperable between platforms. The US government could require the same. More open services Another likely change is how hardware from other companies, such as smartwatches, will interact with the Apple range of devices and software, including the iPhone and Apple\u2019s services like Fitness+. The company has also required Apple Watch users to own iOS devices as a way to keep them locked into its existing ecosystem. Chatterjee said making this change would have both positives and negatives. \u201cThe net result would reside somewhere along the spectrum of access to more and cheaper options but also the devaluation of the customer experience that is so highly prized by Apple\u2019s customers,\u201d he said. The Biden administration has also taken issue with Apple\u2019s lack of support for mobile cloud services. Loosening this could allow users to access games and other cloud-based apps without having to pay for pricey hardware. Inside the debate The DOJ lawsuit claims Apple\u2019s behavior has illegally hindered competition, kept its customers locked into its products and prevented other companies from innovating. Although the Biden administration will have to prove these harms, some critics say any potential changes Apple could make will negatively impact the user experience. David McQueen, a research director at ABI Research, said he recognizes that the content and applications market should be open, and Apple needs to avoid monopolistic advantages that can restrict competition, push up prices or block innovation. But Apple\u2019s success stems in part to its tight grip on its products and services, keeping things intuitive and seamless. \u201cIf Apple is forced to comply, it could potentially spell the end to the provision of this consistent and unified user experience, although by the same token, consumers will be open to a greater choice of apps and services, helping more developers and providers,\u201d McQueen said. Chatterjee noted some people are drawn to the Apple family of products precisely because of the carefully managed ecosystem\u2019s ease of use. Apple may have to work that much harder to preserve the integrity of its experience, but any changes probably won\u2019t be enough to make customers to leave and go elsewhere. \u201cThe vast majority of Apple customers would probably be happier with some more choice and lower prices as long as it did not hamper their levels of customer experience, which is threatened by the less control Apple has over the experience,\u201d Chatterjee said. But he added those currently outside of the Apple ecosystem will likely benefit by \u201cplugging in opportunistically without having to go all in with Apple.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl", "text": "Sam Altman has agreed to return to lead OpenAI, the company said in a Tuesday post on X, just days after his surprise ouster as chief executive sparked an employee revolt that threatened to undermine what has been the leading company in the fledgling artificial intelligence industry. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman wrote that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft, which is the ChatGPT maker\u2019s biggest financial backer. The announcement appears to bring to an end days of chaos for the AI industry that included negotiations over who should lead OpenAI and how the firm should be run, as well as broader discussions about just how fast the arms race to develop AI technology should be moving. The details of Altman\u2019s firing and re-hiring remain murky. In its announcement Friday, OpenAI claimed that Altman had been insufficiently \u201ccandid\u201d with the board. That ambiguous language sent the rumor mill flying. But a key factor in Altman\u2019s ouster was the presence of\u00a0tensions between Altman, who favored pushing AI development more aggressively, and members of the original OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the crisis. As of Monday morning, Nadella had announced that Altman, along with fellow OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, would be joining Microsoft to lead a new AI research division. OpenAI said it had hired former Twitch chief Emmett Shear as interim CEO. But then hundreds of OpenAI employees, nearly the company\u2019s entire staff, threatened to leave, potentially for Microsoft, if the company\u2019s board didn\u2019t resign and reinstate Altman as CEO. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it invested billions in to help bolster its ambitions in developing AI, which many in Silicon Valley think will be the most important wave of technological advancement in the coming decades. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Microsoft CEO\u00a0Satya Nadella said on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d Altman\u2019s vision to quickly roll out and commercialize AI tools also appears to have won out. Publicly, Altman has long cautioned about risks posed by AI, and he\u202fhas pledged to lawmakers and customers that he would move OpenAI forward responsibly. \u201cIs [AI] gonna be like the printing press that diffused knowledge, power and learning widely across the landscape that empowered ordinary, everyday individuals that led to greater flourishing, that led above all to greater liberty?\u201d he said in a May Senate subcommittee hearing pressing for regulation. \u201cOr is it gonna be more like the atom bomb \u2014 huge technological breakthrough, but the consequences (severe, terrible) continue to haunt us to this day?\u201d But inside the company, Altman had been pushing to bring products to market more quickly and to sell them for a profit. Altman announced a few weeks ago at OpenAI\u2019s first-ever developer day that the company would make tools available so anyone could create their own version of ChatGPT. OpenAI has also worked with Microsoft to roll out ChatGPT-like technology across Microsoft\u2019s products. OpenAI and iPhone designer Jony Ive had also reportedly\u202fbeen in talks to raise $1 billion from Japanese conglomerate SoftBank for an AI device to replace the smartphone. \u2014 CNN\u2019s Juliana Liu and Diksha Madhok contributed reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_cars_europe-china-ev-tariffs", "text": "The European Union has hiked tariffs on electric cars imported from China, drawing a rebuke from Beijing, which sees the bloc as a vital and growing market for its auto industry. Additional tariffs of between 17.4% and 38.1% will be applied on top of the existing EU duty of 10%, according to a statement from the European Commission. That takes the highest overall rate to close to 50%. The provisional decision follows an investigation into China\u2019s state support for electric vehicle makers. The European Commission, the EU\u2019s executive arm, launched the probe in October to establish whether Chinese EV prices are artificially low because of subsidies and so hurt European carmakers. The Commission said its investigation had provisionally concluded that the EV industry in China \u201cbenefits from\u00a0unfair subsidization, which is causing a\u00a0threat of economic injury.\u201d The sharp increase in tariffs highlights the more protective stance on trade with China that Brussels and Washington are adopting. Western officials are concerned that jobs and strategically important industries could be wiped out by cheap Chinese imports. The EU is also probing China\u2019s support for wind turbine companies and solar panel suppliers. But the bloc has to strike a balance between protecting its industry and delivering on commitments to green its economy, which include a ban on the sale of new gasoline and diesel cars from 2035. \u201cThe EU\u2019s green transition cannot be based on unfair imports at the expense of EU industry,\u201d the Commission said in a statement Wednesday. It has applied differing levels of new duties to three major EV makers. BYD \u2014 which jostles with Tesla (TSLA) for position as the world\u2019s biggest seller of battery EVs \u2014 has the lowest additional duty, at 17.1%. Geely, which owns Sweden\u2019s Volvo, has been hit with an extra 20% tariff and SAIC with another 38.1%. As for other EV makers in China, those that cooperated with the EU investigation will see a 21% additional duty, while those that did not will be subject to an extra 38.1% duty. Tesla, which manufactures many of its cars in China, could receive an \u201cindividually calculated duty rate\u201d at a later stage following a request made by the carmaker, the Commission said. Trade war brewing? Europe is the main destination for Chinese EV exports. Last year, the value of EU imports of electric cars from China stood at $11.5 billion, up from just $1.6 billion in 2020, according to Rhodium Group, a think tank. The new EV tariffs\u00a0are likely to kick off intense negotiations between Beijing and Brussels aimed at averting a damaging trade war. The EU must decide by November whether to adopt the tariffs permanently. Beijing\u2019s reaction to the tariffs \u201ccould lead to a trade war (with Europe), which would be devastating for a region that is still heavily dependent on Chinese-dominated supply chains in order to achieve its lofty climate goals,\u201d Will Roberts, head of automotive research at\u00a0consultancy Rho\u00a0Motion, said in a statement Friday. Responding to the EU announcement, China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce accused the bloc of \u201ccreating and escalating trade tensions\u201d and said the move would hurt European consumers. It vowed in a statement to take \u201call necessary measures to firmly defend the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies.\u201d There are also risks for European automakers. Many of them manufacture cars in China and then sell them in Europe, a set-up that will be more costly as a result of the higher tariffs. In addition, Germany\u2019s carmakers rely heavily on China for sales, and retaliation by Beijing could make life harder for them. According to Rho Motion, Tesla accounted for more than half of the battery EVs imported by the EU last year, with Volvo and Renault\u2019s Dacia brand also supplying significant volumes. BYD has only 1.5% of the EU market so far this year but is targeting 5% next year, Roberts at Rho Motion told CNN. \u201cBeijing is likely to use both carrots and sticks to build opposition to the Commission\u2019s case, in the hopes that a sufficiently large group of (EU) member states\u2026 emerges in order to block permanent duties,\u201d analysts at Rhodium Group said in a recent research paper. For example, China could raise tariffs on EU vehicle imports to 25%, from their current level of 15%, or target other European exports such as wine and luxury goods, according to Rhodium. Beijing has already launched an anti-dumping investigation into brandy imported from the EU and could impose tariffs that would hit French cognac makers. Alternatively, Beijing could pledge investment into EU countries and promise better market access in China for EU firms, the Rhodium analysts wrote. Germany vs France EU member states, meanwhile, are divided on the tariffs. While France and Spain are in favor, politicians and auto industry executives in Germany are firmly opposed. Speaking Saturday, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said protectionism and isolation \u201cultimately just makes everything more expensive and everyone poorer.\u201d He added: \u201cWe do not close our markets to foreign companies because we do not want that for our companies either.\u201d Still, the pressure to protect European automakers grew more urgent last month after Chinese EVs were all but priced out of the United States. President Joe Biden quadrupled import duties on Chinese EVs to 100% as part of a sweeping package of tariffs on goods from China, including semiconductors and batteries. Given the competing priorities that European officials had to consider, they could not be as heavy-handed in their approach. In a report in April, Rhodium Group analysts said duties of 40%-50% would probably be necessary \u201cto make the European market unattractive for Chinese EV exporters.\u201d For BYD, tariffs would likely have to be even higher to be effective, they added. Chinese manufacturers should be able to absorb some of the additional tariffs \u201cinto their padded profit margins,\u201d commented Roberts of Rho Motion. China\u2019s EV makers could also find ways around the tariffs. BYD pledged in December to open a factory in Hungary, an EU member. That would be BYD\u2019s first plant for passenger cars in Europe.

{"id": "2024_06_08_tech_hong-kong-uber-taxis-intl-hnk", "text": "They hire their Uber through the app just like any other passenger, and hop in the back of the car. But halfway through the ride, the mood changes and they reveal their identity. \u201cPull over here. It\u2019s you. You are in trouble for driving an Uber,\u201d the passenger tells his driver, during one of a few recent encounters captured in video and circulated online in Hong Kong. The passengers aren\u2019t traffic cops. They are vigilante taxi drivers taking direct action, having become increasingly frustrated about Hong Kong authorities\u2019 failure to regulate the ride-hailing platform. After the car pulls over, they hand over the driver, often still reeling in shock, to the police officers they have called. \u201cYou may say this is provocative. But without these videos, people may think we inflate the numbers of \u2018white-plate vehicles\u2019 out there,\u201d one of the taxi drivers who took part in a sting operation, and asked to be only identified as Ka Chun, told CNN. \u201cWhite-plate vehicles\u201d is how taxi drivers colloquially refer to Uber. \u201cWe just want the government to enforce the law.\u201d Uber (UBER) remains technically illegal in Hong Kong, which it entered in 2014. But it has thrived under the ambiguous approach of officials keen to project an image of technological modernity. \u201cUber is often framed as innovation, which seems to contribute to the \u2018smart city\u2019 vision \u2013 something that the Hong Kong government has strived to be,\u201d said Oliver Chan, an assistant communications studies professor who specializes in the gig economy at Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK). Ads for the US-headquartered company are widespread, and its drivers are highly unlikely to face problems with the authorities. Taxi drivers have for years complained about how Uber has flouted local laws, upended the market, and chipped away their already modest earnings. But their recent acts of vigilantism appear to have backfired. Instead of rallying public support, the cabbies were on the receiving end of a backlash, with passengers taking to social media to share their bad experiences of rude taxi drivers, ride rejections and opportunistic charging during heavy rains and the city\u2019s regular summer typhoons. \u201cThey charge arbitrarily and refuse to take passengers. And yet, they have the audacity to go on sting operations,\u201d one person wrote on LIHKG, a popular local internet forum, adding: \u201cShameless people know no bounds.\u201d Others have retaliated by reporting law-breaking taxi drivers to police. Pictures of taxis parking in restricted areas flooded the internet in posts calling for people to report them. WhatsApp groups set up by Uber drivers also discuss how to retaliate, one driver told CNN. So tense is the backlash that Hong Kong leader John Lee, when asked about the furor by reporters last week, acknowledged the \u201cfierce public debate\u201d and appealed for calm. He urged taxi drivers to stay away from any vigilante acts. As with New York\u2019s amber-painted medallion taxis and London\u2019s black hackney cabs, Hong Kong\u2019s 15,000 red urban taxis are emblematic of the city. But they are not exactly known for their friendliness or reliable service. Passenger Lau Chi-tim recalled being charged double during a typhoon a few years ago. Drivers often charge a little more because their insurance does not cover extreme weather conditions. But Lau said: \u201cThe trip lasted only 15 minutes and most of the journey was inside a tunnel anyway. Where is the risk?\u201d Another passenger lamented how selective taxi drivers can be. \u201cPeople with pets, a pram, wanting to cross the harbor, or going anywhere that may be crowded\u2026 they just reject you,\u201d Jason Chan said. Similar complaints abound, despite refusal to take passengers being an offense under the Hong Kong law. Those who prefer Uber see it as an alternative to the poor service they have long tolerated and would rather pay a little more for a smoother ride. An Uber driver, who gave only his name Mo for fear of being identified by authorities, said passengers told him they preferred Uber drivers\u2019 manners, and quality of driving. \u201cWe don\u2019t dare swerve around on the road because it\u2019s our own vehicle,\u201d he said. But for Ka Chun, the driver who went undercover, it\u2019s about defending their interest and an institution that he and his fellow cabbies invested time and money to be part of. \u201cThey have an impact on us because these white-plate vehicles can take passengers without a taxi license,\u201d he said, speaking of a permit that can cost a fortune in the city where properties, and even parking spaces, are traded as speculative commodities. Hong Kong\u2019s transport authority has issued some 18,000 taxi licenses \u2013 including for non-urban blue and green cabs - and they are currently traded for up to $400,000 (HK$3.2 million) in a free market. Annual insurance for a taxi also costs up to 10 times that for private vehicles. Drivers who don\u2019t own a taxi pay rental of 550 Hong Kong dollars (about $70) for a 12-hour shift, almost a third of what they make on an average day, according to Ka Chun. \u201cUber drivers don\u2019t need any capital whatsoever as they are using their own car to take passengers,\u201d he said. Patrick Tam, secretary general of the Hong Kong Taxi & Public Light Bus Association, acknowledged the complaints against some unruly taxi drivers, and said he supported the police going after them. \u201cThese taxi drivers should face tough punishment. But it doesn\u2019t make vehicles operating without a proper license less of a problem,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just want fair treatment.\u201d So far, Hong Kong police have said they had not arrested any Uber drivers ensnared in the amateur sting operations. Estyn Chung, general manager of Uber in Hong Kong, noted that the company launched its Uber Taxi service in 2020 to give riders the option to get a taxi on its app. \u201cWe know from elsewhere around the world that taxi and ride-sharing services can thrive alongside each other. Hong Kong is not an exception,\u201d he said. Creating harmony between traditional cabbies and gig-economy drivers can be tricky. And CUHK\u2019s Chan said that, after years of ambiguity, Hong Kong is already playing catch-up. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to say the extent to which the government wants to promote Uber, and more broadly, ride-hailing platforms at this point,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Hong Kong\u2019s ride-hailing regulations lag behind, for example, Singapore.\u201d The city government is expected to unveil a study on online ride-hailing services in July. A spokesman said it is \u201copen-minded\u201d on the apps, though \u201cthey must be in compliance with the relevant law and regulations.\u201d \u201cThe government should require them to get a different driver permit and insurance even if it legalizes their operation,\u201d said Ka Chun. \u201cOtherwise, why should I get a taxi license? I could drive white-plate vehicles.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/08/tech/hong-kong-uber-taxis-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_economy_consumer-price-index-inflation-may", "text": "Inflation cooled more than expected in May, new data showed Wednesday, delivering a welcome piece of news just hours before the Federal Reserve is set to make its latest announcement on interest rates. Consumer prices rose 3.3% from a year earlier, slowing from April\u2019s 3.4% rate, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 latest Consumer Price Index report released Wednesday. On a monthly basis, prices held flat for the first time since July 2022. Falling gas prices kept inflation in check following a 0.3% gain in April. \u201cThis is the best news we could\u2019ve gotten this morning,\u201d Philip T. Powell, executive director of the Indiana Business Research Center and clinical associate professor at the Indiana University Kelley School of Business, told CNN. \u201cThe Federal Reserve has been watching to make sure this [monthly] number came in below 0.2%.\u201d \u201cIf it did, that means inflation is going to come down, which means [the Fed] could lower interest rates,\u201d he added. Economists were expecting a 0.1% monthly increase and an annual gain of 3.4%, according to FactSet consensus estimates. Helping to slow inflation in May were falling gas prices, which dropped 3.6% from April. They\u2019re still up 2.2% for the year. Grocery prices were flat and overall food prices went up by 0.1%, lifted by a slight acceleration in inflation at the restaurant level. Car insurance and transportation prices fall, but housing inflation is stuck running high Excluding gas and food, categories that tend to be volatile, the closely watched \u201ccore\u201d measure rose just 0.2% for the month (its slowest pace since October of last year), and its annual rate dropped to 3.4%, setting a fresh three-year low. \u201cAdding to the good inflation news, core services inflation (excludes energy services) printed its mildest monthly increase since September 2021,\u201d Kathy Bostjancic, Nationwide\u2019s chief economist, wrote in a note issued Wednesday. \u201cThis is significant since core services inflation has been very sticky and the key reason overall inflation has not cooled more quickly.\u201d However, shelter inflation more than offset the decline in gasoline, rising 0.4% for the fourth month in a row, underscoring the pressure Americans are feeling from\u00a0housing-related expenses. On an annual basis, shelter inflation slowed a tenth of a percentage point to 5.4%, which is its lowest rate since April 2022. However, in addition to outpacing overall inflation, the cost of shelter is running above its pre-pandemic average and the 3.3% rate in February 2020. The shelter index, an abstruse measurement of housing costs, has been the thorn in the side of the Fed\u2019s desire to see overall inflation return to target. (That target, by the way, is based on a separate inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, which stayed pat at 2.7% in April.) Shelter\u2019s heavily weighted in the CPI, and while it doesn\u2019t fully reflect some of the slowdown seen in market-rate rents, its persistently high readings certainly do speak to the pain Americans are feeling in their biggest monthly expense. \u201cThe one thing that sticks out in these numbers is the continued struggle with housing affordability,\u201d Indiana University\u2019s Powell said. \u201cThere is so much pent-up demand out there for housing, it\u2019s not going to go away.\u201d Transportation services prices fell for the first time since the fall of 2021, dropping 0.5% for the month. And motor vehicle insurance prices ticked down by 0.1%, a sharp contrast from the spikes seen during the past two months. Still, those costs continue to run hot for consumers, with transportation services prices up 10.5% from a year ago and car insurance up 20.3%. \u201cThe big and important things that households spend their money on \u2014 food, transportation and shelter \u2014 there\u2019s not been a lot of relief there,\u201d Sean Snaith, University of Central Florida economist, told CNN. Soft CPI boosts chances for Fed cuts The CPI, which tracks average change in prices for a basket of goods and services common to consumers, is the most widely cited inflation metric. But on Wednesday, it was merely the opening act. The report landed just hours before the Fed was scheduled to wrap up its policymaking meeting, deliver its latest economic projections, and announce the next steps for interest rates. Although the softer CPI likely will be welcomed by central bankers, economists say it won\u2019t be enough to move the needle on interest rates, which are overwhelmingly expected to hold steady Wednesday (markets are seeing a mere 0.1% probability of a June cut). \u201cLogically, then, today\u2019s news would seem to open the door to a July rate cut, although we still think that\u2019s very unlikely given hawkish rhetoric from the Fed recently,\u201d Preston Caldwell, chief US economist at Morningstar, wrote Wednesday. \u201cBut rate cuts starting by September should now be cemented as overwhelmingly likely.\u201d Traders seem to agree: The latest projections from the CME FedWatch Tool had the likelihood of a September rate cut at nearly 63% on Wednesday morning, jumping from 46.8% Tuesday. The Fed on Wednesday is expected to tip its hand some with the release of the latest Summary of Economic Projections (SEP). The quarterly publication includes the central bankers\u2019 forecasts for key economic indicators such as inflation, GDP growth and unemployment as well as the \u201cdot plot,\u201d a chart of their expectations for interest rates. When the Fed released its prior SEP back in March, it showed the possibility of three cuts penciled in for the remainder of the year. Economists expect that number to drop, given that there are fewer months left on that runway and still fairly strong economic data touching down (be it the hotter-than-expected inflation reports to start the year or the stronger-than-expected job gains). \u201cThe CPI report for May came in a bit better than we dared hope for given the string of disappointing readings to start the year,\u201d Scott Anderson, chief US economist for BMO Bank, wrote in a note Wednesday. \u201cIf sustained, it will keep Fed rate-cut expectations that we have penciled in for September and December alive and well. Restrictive monetary policy has more work to do, and the Fed will remain patient and watchful.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/economy/consumer-price-index-inflation-may/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "business"}}

Altman has told executives at contract chipmaker TSMC that\u00a0he wanted to build roughly three dozen new chip factories, Reuters\u00a0has previously reported. Samsung\u00a0is one of the few companies that sells memory chips, offers foundry services and designs chips under the same roof. That combination has often worked against it in the past, as some clients were nervous that doing business with its foundry might benefit\u00a0Samsung\u00a0as a competitor in another field. However, with skyrocketing demand for AI chips and the need for all the chip parts to be highly integrated to train or infer huge amounts of data fast by using less power,\u00a0Samsung\u00a0believes its turnkey approach will be a strength going forward. The South Korean tech giant also touted its cutting-edge chip architecture known as gate all-around (GAA), a type of transistor architecture that helps improve chip performance and reduces power consumption. GAA is seen as important to keep making more powerful chips for AI as chips become finer to the point of pushing the boundaries of physics. Although competitors such as global foundry No 1 TSMC are also working on chips using GAA,\u00a0Samsung\u00a0started applying GAA earlier, and said it plans to mass produce its second-generation 3-nanometer chips using GAA in the second half of this year. Samsung\u00a0also announced its latest 2-nanometer chipmaking process for high-performance computing chips, which places power rails on the backside of the wafer to improve power delivery. Mass production is slated for 2027.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/tech/south-korea-samsung-ai-chips-plan-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_20_success_interest-rates-savings-cash", "text": "The Federal Reserve\u2019s benchmark interest rate remains at a 23-year high. That\u2019s thanks to the central bank\u2019s decision Wednesday to once again hold it steady, as it has done at the policy-making committee\u2019s past five meetings. That decision may be disappointing to some investors, homebuyers and those with a lot of credit card debt, since movement in the Fed\u2019s overnight lending rate influences rates \u2014 directly or indirectly \u2014 on consumer financial products (e.g., credit cards, bank loans and mortgages). But\u00a0with the Fed signaling that no rate cuts are likely until summer, it also means anyone with savings still has at least a few more months to make hay of their stash. That\u2019s because you can still get inflation-beating interest rates that will grow any money you have set aside for emergencies, vacations, down payments or any other goal in your sights over the next several years. However, that won\u2019t happen if you just let it sit in a traditional checking or savings account that yields next to nothing. There are more lucrative, low-risk options out there, with rates that are still at or near their peaks. \u201cBut perhaps not for much longer,\u201d said Ted Rossman, senior analyst at Bankrate. \u201cIf one of those fits into your financial plans, it\u2019s best to act soon.\u201d So, consider the following options when deciding where to park your hard-earned savings. High-yield online savings accounts The average annual percentage yield on bank savings accounts was just 0.52% as of March 13, according to Bankrate. That average is kept low by the biggest brick-and-mortar banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, which still are offering a paltry 0.01%. By contrast, there are still FDIC-insured online banks offering inflation-beating rates of between 4.35% and 5.35% on their high-yield savings accounts. Generally speaking, these are the best vehicles in which to keep your emergency funds for quick, easy access. Choosing between an account that pays 0.52% and one that pays 5.35% can mean forfeiting hundreds of dollars in interest. \u201cIf you put $10,000 in a savings account, that\u2019s a difference of $496 in interest earnings over the course of the year, assuming monthly compounding,\u201d Rossman said. While the rates on high-yield savings accounts have gone down a bit in recent months, \u201cwidespread cuts in online savings account rates are unlikely until the first Fed rate cut is near,\u201d said Ken Tumin, founder of DepositAccounts.com. As with any bank savings rate, high-yield savings account\u00a0rates\u00a0can change overnight, and the bank may not alert you when it lowers it. So make sure to check your monthly statement. Certificates of deposits Another high-return, low-risk investment that is great for money you likely won\u2019t need to tap for a few months or even a couple of years is a certificate of deposit. You can get the best returns on CDs through a brokerage such as Schwab, E*Trade or Fidelity. That\u2019s because you can comparison shop for CDs from any number of FDIC-insured banks and will not have to set up individual accounts with each institution. As of March 13, the average rate on a one-year CD was 1.95%, but some banks are offering as much are 5.4%. If you can get a one-year CD at, say, 5.4%, you will make $540 on a $10,000 investment. To get the greatest benefit from a CD, you have to leave the money invested for a fixed period. You can always access your principal sooner if you need to, but there may be early withdrawal penalties. As of March 20, CDs listed on Schwab.com with durations from three months up to three years were all yielding between 5.2% and 5.51%. CD rates on durations between four and 10 years ranged from 4.40% to 5.15%. Say you invest $10,000 in a one-year CD with a 5.36%\u00a0APY. At the end of that period, you\u2019d get your principal back plus $536 in interest when the CD matures, according to Bankrate\u2019s CD calculator. If you chose a two-year CD at 5.25%, you\u2019d bank an extra $1,078, assuming compounding interest. The same investment in a five-year CD at 5.15% would earn $2,854. \u201cIt makes sense to go long with CDs. To hedge your bets, include terms from one to five years. Starting a CD ladder will provide this mix,\u201d Tumin said. If you don\u2019t go through a brokerage you may get a reasonable deal from your primary bank, Tumin said. For example, he noted, Wells Fargo is still offering up to 5.01% on both 4-month and 7-month CDs. Or, at Bank of America, you can get up to 4.75% on a 7-month CD. But Tumin cautions that with any big bank CD you should take your money out at the end of the term, otherwise your bank may automatically renew it and lock you in to a much lower-yielding CD. Money market accounts and funds If you don\u2019t want to set up an online savings account at another bank, your own bank may offer you a money market deposit account that pays a higher yield than your regular checking or savings accounts. Money market accounts may have higher minimum deposit requirements than a regular savings account, but they are more liquid than a fixed-term certificate of deposit or Treasury bill, meaning they give you access to your money more quickly while still potentially giving you some of the highest yields available, said Doug Ornstein, senior manager for integrated solutions at TIAA Wealth Management. But don\u2019t confuse money market accounts with money market mutual funds, which invest in short-term, low-risk debt instruments. As of March 19, they had an average 7-day yield of 5.14%, according to the Crane Money Fund Index, which tracks the top 100 taxable money market funds. Unlike money market deposit accounts, money market mutual funds are not insured by the FDIC. But if you invest in a money market fund through a brokerage, your overall account is likely to be insured through the Securities Investor Protection Corp, which offers protection in the event your brokerage ever goes under. Treasury bills and notes Another option for money you can leave untouched anywhere from several months to a few years is to buy short-term Treasury bills and medium-term notes, which are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. Three- and six-month bills had yields of 5.39% and 5.33%\u00a0respectively on March 20 before the Fed\u2019s meeting ended, while nine-month and one-year bills were offering 5.19% and 5.08%\u00a0respectively, according to rates posted on Schwab.com for a $25,000 investment. Rates on Treasury notes with durations from two years to 10 years ranged between 4.29% and 4.72%. If you\u2019re someone who manages your portfolio like a hawk, you may feel comfortable buying T-bills on your own from TreasuryDirect.gov. But if you don\u2019t, it might be easier just to buy new issues through your brokerage account or invest in a short-term bond index fund or ETF, said Andy Smith, executive director of financial planning at Edelman Financial Engines. And if you\u2019re looking at money that will be needed in three to five years, you might consider a diversified fund of highly rated government and corporate bonds, Ornstein said. An 18-month AAA-rated corporate bond, for instance, was yielding 4.82% this week, while the three-year was at 4.49%. Meanwhile, three-year AAA-rated municipal bonds (which are issued by local governments) had a rate of 3.98%, according to Schwab.com. Don\u2019t chase yield When deciding on the best accounts and investments for your specific goals and peace of mind, it may pay to consult a fee-only fiduciary adviser \u2014 meaning, someone who doesn\u2019t get paid a commission to sell you a particular investment. What you\u2019ll always want to do is build in flexibility for yourself so you can easily access cash, regardless of your timeline for key goals. \u201cWhat happens if something changes and you need that down payment a lot sooner \u2014 or your parents need medical care fast?\u201d Smith said. That means balancing your desire for great yield with a need and desire for ease of access without penalty. Translation: Don\u2019t chase yield for yield\u2019s sake. Think of it this way, Ornstein said: Unless you have huge sums to invest or are an institutional investor, the difference between getting a 5.1% yield versus 5% is negligible, and in fact it could even cost you more if there are penalties for taking your money out early. \u201cMost of the time convenience is really important. Give up the 0.1%,\u201d he advised.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/20/success/interest-rates-savings-cash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_media_shari-redstone-david-ellison-skydance-paramount-deal", "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:\u00a0A version of this article first appeared in the \u201cReliable Sources\u201d newsletter.\u00a0Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here. Shari Redstone\u00a0has\u00a0finally\u00a0spoken. After weeks of endless speculation about the future of\u00a0Paramount Global, and more than half a year of grueling negotiations, the heiress called off talks with\u00a0David Ellison\u2019s Skydance Media, astonishing the industry and raising questions about the future of her family-controlled media empire. The deal went up in flames at the one-yard line. Just as Paramount\u2019s special committee was set to vote on the deal, lawyers representing the Redstone holding company\u00a0National Amusements Inc.\u00a0sent word that she had moved to end merger discussions, CNN was told. Why Redstone ultimately vetoed the deal is now up for discussion. Was Redstone irked by the latest financials of the offer? Was she afraid of shareholder litigation? Is legacy at play? Or is it simply that Redstone just cannot let go of the empire her father,\u00a0Sumner, built? The answer, of course, depends \u2014\u00a0greatly\u00a0\u2014 on who you ask. One narrative that has emerged is that, while the two parties had agreed on the economic terms, there were still outstanding issues they had not been able to see eye-to-eye on. Chief among them was whether the deal should have been subject to approval from a majority of the minority shareholders. Redstone had advocated for a vote to protect against potential lawsuits; Skydance resisted. \u201cThat was an important term,\u201d a person close to the matter told CNN. The competing narrative is that Skydance had made a competitive offer. Ellison and his backers, led by\u00a0Redbird Capital, had repeatedly sweetened the terms of the deal and met all the financial requirements for it to happen over many months of painstaking negotiations. In this version of events, the real reason a transaction is not taking place is because Redstone, advised by Ellison foe\u00a0Charles Phillips, simply got cold feet. \u201cShari got spooked,\u201d as one person bluntly told CNN. Regardless of the cause, the deal is not happening \u2014 and squabbling about the reason it could not get across the finish line does not change that reality. Instead, it underscores the brewing tension between the two sides as the frustrated parties struggled to make a potential marriage work. And tried they did over the last several months, with the negotiations claiming several high-profile casualties along the way. Over the course of the last few months,\u00a0Bob Bakish\u00a0was ousted as chief executive of Paramount Global and four directors resigned from the company\u2019s board. The corporate drama, as many observers have pointed out, has been akin to a real-life\u00a0\u201cSuccession.\u201d NAI, which has received interest from other parties and will now explore them, offered support Tuesday afternoon for the Office of the CEO\u00a0at Paramount Global, the post-Bakish triumvirate made up of\u00a0Brian Robbins,\u00a0George Cheeks and\u00a0Chris McCarthy. The trio last week outlined a plan for the company, which includes exploring a joint streaming venture, finding synergies, and reducing costs by $500 million. \u201cNAI supports the recently announced strategic plan being executed by Paramount\u2019s Office of the CEO as well as their ongoing work and that of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors to continue to explore opportunities to drive value creation for all Paramount shareholders,\u201d the family-owned company said in a statement. NAI also said it \u201clooks forward to the ongoing, successful production collaboration between Paramount and Skydance.\u201d The two companies have in recent years partnered for blockbusters such as\u00a0\u201cTop Gun\u201d\u00a0and\u00a0\u201cMission Impossible.\u201d \u201cAt this point, there was an unbelievable amount of uncertainty hanging over the company,\u201d one of the people said of Paramount. \u201cThey want the company to be able to move forward.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/media/shari-redstone-david-ellison-skydance-paramount-deal/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_tech_tiktok-pew-research-politics-x", "text": "TikTok may not be as hot a place for politics as many seem to think. The attention devoted to TikTok as a powerful force in US politics \u2014 for better or for worse \u2014 does not seem to match up with the experience of most TikTok users, according to new survey data released Wednesday by the Pew Research Center and the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation. As the short-form video app has surged to 170 million US users, politicians have flocked to TikTok in hopes of wooing young voters. Former President Donald Trump joined TikTok last week, amassing 6 million followers in a matter of days. President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign launched on TikTok in February and has posted more than 200 videos \u2014 though the campaign\u2019s following is just a fraction of Trump\u2019s at 373,000. Other politicians, meanwhile, warn that TikTok\u2019s links to China through its parent company mean the Chinese government could theoretically try to influence US politics on a massive scale, if it ever accessed the personal data of TikTok users. (TikTok denies it has ever given the Chinese government US user data and is suing to block a law Biden signed this spring that could ban the app from the United States.) But the picture painted by Pew\u2019s latest surveys suggests politics is still just a small part of what the platform has to offer. Many TikTok users in the survey said they care far more about entertainment, culture and friends. They don\u2019t care as much about \u2014 or may not even want \u2014 political content in their feeds, according to the survey, a finding that\u2019s consistent with users of Facebook and Instagram (but not on X, formerly Twitter, where news and politics have historically dominated). Pew said its research involved 10,287 adult internet users in the United States who were surveyed from March 18 to March 24. The results were weighted \u201cto be representative of all US adults by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories,\u201d Pew added. The research casts a slightly different light on TikTok and other social media platforms widely described as the new town square \u2014 where politicians and politically engaged Americans go to engage in cultural debate, score political points and supposedly influence the rest of the electorate. In fact, the vast majority of the US TikTok users surveyed didn\u2019t cite politics as a major or even minor reason for using the app, and just 12% reported posting any political content at all. \u201cLike on other platforms we\u2019ve studied, on TikTok, politics for most people takes a backseat to things like entertainment and connection,\u201d said Colleen McClain, a Pew researcher and co-author of Wednesday\u2019s study. TikTok users don\u2019t care much about politics Many TikTok users, roughly 4 in 10, said they do see at least some politics content on the app, according to the survey. Still, politics ranked dead last among reasons people cited for using the platform, implying that the lion\u2019s share of users are not seeking out political content, to the extent they see any at all. Only a third of TikTok users said they use the app to keep up with politics; 41% said they use it to get news. By contrast, 95% said they use TikTok to get entertainment; 62% said they use it to look at product reviews or recommendations; and 53% said they use it to keep up with sports or pop culture, the results show. People who don\u2019t post about politics on TikTok also had strong views about why they don\u2019t do so: More than half of that group, 56%, said they don\u2019t care about politics, while as much as 47% said politics just doesn\u2019t belong on TikTok. Those figures highlight the challenge for political campaigns in reaching young voters on TikTok. Does TikTok lean left or right? Previous Pew research, from a survey completed in September 2023, found that 40% of TikTok users identify as Republican or lean Republican, while 52% are Democrats or lean Democratic. With Trump joining the platform, those numbers could potentially shift, as well as the ideological tilt of content on the platform or people\u2019s perceptions of it.\u00a0A TikTok official told CNN last week that pro-Trump content tends to attract much higher engagement than pro-Biden content, although other recent research has suggested that part of Biden\u2019s lackluster performance on TikTok could be related to his decision to sign a prospective TikTok ban bill \u2014 angering even many liberal TikTok users \u2014 as well as his administration\u2019s approach to the war in Gaza, which polls unfavorably among young voters. Right now, 22% of TikTok users say content on the app is mostly liberal, while 6% say it\u2019s mostly conservative, according to Pew\u2019s latest survey. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily tell us much: Pew reported similar assessments of Facebook and Instagram by those platforms\u2019 users. And while 28% of TikTok users took a position on the ideological lean of the app\u2019s content, far more, 48%, say it doesn\u2019t tilt either way or that they aren\u2019t sure. It\u2019s perhaps little surprise, then, that even as US politicians rail against TikTok for threatening US democracy, huge majorities of TikTok users \u2014 82% \u2014 said the app either has no impact on or is mostly good for democracy. TikTok users who identify as Republicans were slightly more likely than Democratic TikTok users to say TikTok is bad for US democracy, but only by a slim margin of 7 percentage points. Major swings in views of X Those numbers contrast sharply with a stunning shift in attitudes toward X since Elon Musk purchased Twitter in a $44 billion acquisition in 2022, perhaps reflecting Musk\u2019s polarizing approach to managing the platform since then. According to Wednesday\u2019s research, Republican users flipped from overwhelmingly viewing Twitter as mostly bad for democracy in 2021 to overwhelmingly viewing X as mostly good for democracy in 2023 and 2024. \u201cIn the past three years, the share of Republican users who say X is mostly good for democracy has roughly tripled, and it\u2019s continuing,\u201d McClain said. \u201cThis is a dramatic shift. And the overall pattern we see here is a little bit different than on other platforms.\u201d Just 17% of Republican Twitter users said the platform was mostly good for democracy in 2021. By 2023, that figure had risen to about half and is now at a high of 53%, Pew said. What\u2019s more, Republican users who post about politics on X were far more likely to claim today that their views are welcome there (54% versus 33% for Democrats). Negative views of X have increased among Democratic users over the same timeframe and continues to trend negative, McClain said. \u201cViews of X and democracy are deeply partisan,\u201d the Pew study said. \u201cRepublicans are about twice as likely as Democrats to say it\u2019s good for democracy. Democrats are three times as likely as Republicans to say it\u2019s bad.\u201d Pew\u2019s research does not speculate on why Republican users of X have experienced a change of heart about the platform. But the shift coincides with one of the most consequential business decisions in the company\u2019s history and its aftermath \u2014 the decision to sell to Musk, who through layoffs, policy changes and more has radically reshaped a platform once seen as central to news and politics. During his ownership of the platform, Musk has claimed he has unwound censorship of conservative speech and welcomed back users who were previously suspended for promoting hate speech and for other violations of Twitter\u2019s terms. He has himself indulged in antisemitic conspiracy theories, rolled back protections for users from marginalized communities and amplified discredited election claims, prompting a backlash from advertisers and civil rights groups. And his changes to the platform\u2019s verification badges, which prompted an initial wave of high-profile account impersonations, made it more difficult for users to understand if a celebrity or brand account was the real thing or if it had simply paid for the veneer of authenticity. With Facebook, Instagram and TikTok, the predominant response by users is that those platforms have little to no impact on democracy, McClain said, but the opposite is true for X. While that probably won\u2019t stop political campaigns from flooding the zone on every platform they have access to in an attempt to reach voters, it\u2019s a reminder that blasting a message out on social media isn\u2019t the same thing as getting people to listen.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/tech/tiktok-pew-research-politics-x/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_ftc-tiktok-probe-privacy-and-security", "text": "The Federal Trade Commission is investigating TikTok for its data and security practices, two sources told CNN on the condition of anonymity. The probe is yet another complication for the social media platform, which is already facing the threat of a potential US ban or a forced divestment from its Chinese parent company. The sources said that the FTC is probing TikTok over an alleged violation of the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection rule, which requires companies to notify parents and obtain consent before collecting data from children under 13. The agency is also investigating whether TikTok violated a portion of the FTC Act that prohibits \u201cunfair or deceptive\u201d business practices, the sources said, in denying that TikTok user data could be accessed by individuals in China. The FTC could bring a suit against TikTok or settle with the company in the coming weeks, according to one of the sources. Politico reported news of the probe earlier. When asked about the investigation, FTC Director of Public Affairs Douglas Farrar replied: \u201cNo comment.\u201d TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The FTC probe comes as TikTok faces an existential threat in the US. Earlier this month, a bipartisan group in the US House of Representatives voted to pass a law forcing TikTok to be sold by ByteDance or face a ban from US app stores. The bill is now before the Senate, and President Joe Biden has said he would sign it if it gets to his desk. Senate leaders, however, have indicated they are taking a deliberate approach \u2014\u00a0which could lead to delays or even potentially doom the House bill. The short-form video company, owned by Chinese firm ByteDance, has denied assertions that its app poses a national security threat to US citizens. TikTok, which does not operate in China, has said that the Chinese government has never accessed US user data. Cybersecurity experts say Chinese laws require ByteDance to cooperate with that country\u2019s intelligence demands\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a fact that, given ByteDance\u2019s ownership of TikTok, could hypothetically put US user data at risk. To address that issue, TikTok has taken steps to store its US user data on cloud servers controlled by US tech giant Oracle and established internal protocols limiting access by non-US employees. TikTok acknowledged to Congress in 2022 that employees based in China could access US user data, following a report that year by BuzzFeed News that ByteDance employees had accessed that information on multiple occasions. TikTok CEO Shou Chew, in his first appearance before Congress last year, also acknowledged that several ByteDance employees were fired for spying on certain US journalists as part of a \u201cmisguided attempt\u201d to hunt down leakers within the company.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/ftc-tiktok-probe-privacy-and-security/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_22_media_ronna-mcdaniel-nbc", "text": "NBC News on Friday announced that it had hired Ronna McDaniel, the former Republican National Committee chair who has repeatedly\u00a0attacked the network and its journalists,\u00a0assailed the\u00a0news\u00a0media as \u201cfake news\u201d and promoted false claims around the 2020\u00a0vote,\u00a0as an on-air commentator\u00a0ahead of the 2024 presidential election. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be a more important moment to have a voice like Ronna\u2019s on the team,\u201d Carrie Budoff Brown, senior vice president of politics at NBC News, said in a memo\u00a0to staff. McDaniel exited the RNC earlier this month after leading the organization since 2016. During her time as chair, McDaniel repeatedly attacked the press, which has become increasingly popular in Republican circles over the last several years as Donald Trump demonizes journalists and news institutions. McDaniel echoed many such attacks, labeling the press as \u201cfake news\u201d and calling the media \u201ccorrupt.\u201d At times, she even targeted NBC News\u00a0and MSNBC\u00a0with dishonest attacks. In 2019, for instance, McDaniel accused Richard Engel, NBC News\u2019 chief foreign correspondent, of \u201cactively cheering for an economic downturn.\u201d \u201cHow can NBC let him keep his job when he\u2019s made his bias so clear?\u201d McDaniel asked. McDaniel has a lengthier history attacking the progressive cable news channel MSNBC, which she will appear on in her new role. In recent years, she has repeatedly attacked the channel for \u201cspreading lies\u201d and blasted those she described as the network\u2019s \u201cprimetime propagandists.\u201d An NBC spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment about her attacks on the news media and NBC. In her role as RNC chief, McDaniel also fanned the flames of election denialism after the 2020 presidential contest. McDaniel was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d The Michigan Department of State\u2019s office condemned her claims of supposed voter fraud in the wake of the election, stating they had \u201cno merit.\u201d\u00a0The state\u2019s \u201celections were conducted fairly, effectively and transparently and are an accurate reflection of the will of Michigan voters,\u201d it said in a\u00a0detailed fact check\u00a0posted online. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Chris Wallace last year, McDaniel defended her claims of voting \u201cirregularity\u201d in the election. \u201cI think saying that there were problems with 2020 is very real. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s election denying,\u201d McDaniel told Wallace. \u201cI\u2019m from Wayne County. We had a woman send a note saying I\u2019m being told to backdate ballots. We had to look into that. That\u2019s deeply concerning. When you have friends who are poll-watching and being kicked out, that\u2019s deeply concerning. We have every right to look at that.\u201d In the interview,\u00a0Wallace pressed McDaniel if she believed Biden legitimately won the election. \u201cI think there were lots of problems with 2020. Ultimately, he won the election\u00a0but there were lots of problems with the 2020 election,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think he won it fair. I don\u2019t. I\u2019m not going to say that.\u201d NBC\u2019s hiring of McDaniel, however, plays into a recent trend at the\u00a0network\u2019s outlets, which has seemingly softened its stance on Trump as he inches toward the Republican nomination for president. Earlier this month, CNBC hosted Trump for a lengthy phone interview in which the network\u2019s anchors allowed him to peddle lies and conspiracy theories on air\u00a0without scrutiny. MSNBC has even started carrying Trump\u2019s remarks live on television, a practice that the network boasted for years it would not do. Star host Rachel Maddow, who has said carrying Trump\u2019s lies\u00a0on the air\u00a0is dangerous, even objected to the network broadcasting a recent speech from the presumptive Republican nominee, calling it \u201cirresponsible.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/22/media/ronna-mcdaniel-nbc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "business"}}

The Paris-based IEA said Wednesday that it expects growth in global oil production \u2014\u00a0led by the United States and other countries in the Americas \u2014 to \u201cinflate the world\u2019s spare (oil) capacity cushion\u201d to levels seen only once before, during the coronavirus pandemic when oil prices crashed. By 2030, global oil supply will outstrip demand by a \u201cstaggering\u201d 8 million barrels per day, according to forecasts published by the agency in its medium-term oil market report. \u201c(That\u2019s) a major, major surplus and\u2026 might be one of the highest in the history,\u201d Fatih Birol, the IEA\u2019s executive director, told reporters. That surplus \u201ccould upend the current OPEC+ market management strategy aimed at supporting prices,\u201d the agency said in its report, adding that the glut could result in a \u201clower-price environment.\u201d OPEC, which has allied itself with Russia and other producers, did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment. The IEA also forecast growth in global oil demand to \u201cslow progressively\u201d over the rest of the decade, with demand peaking by 2029 before contracting slightly the year after. The agency said the accelerating deployment of clean energy technologies,\u00a0including \u201csurging EV sales,\u201d would be one of the main reasons for the slower growth in oil demand. Unwinding output cuts OPEC+ has been restraining output for about two years in a bid to prevent the emergence of a huge supply surplus that could depress prices and hurt the oil-dependent economies of its member states. Its production cuts amount to about 5.7% of global crude supply.  Earlier this month, the group agreed to extend those deep reductions in crude oil output\u00a0into 2025, but also said it would start to gradually unwind some of the cuts from October 1. Despite the cuts, oil prices have trended downward in recent months. The price of Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, has tumbled almost 9% since hitting a five-month high in early April, to trade at $83 per barrel Wednesday. It stood at $91 in early April when a suspected Israeli\u00a0airstrike\u00a0on Iran\u2019s embassy in Syria sent jitters through oil markets. The price of West Texas Intermediate crude, the US benchmark, has also fallen 9% to trade at $79 a barrel Wednesday. It is down from nearly $87 per barrel in early April. Subdued oil prices have partly been the result of record US oil output, which has bumped up global supply, and concerns about sluggish demand in China \u2014 the world\u2019s biggest importer of oil \u2014\u202f as well as in other major economies.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/energy/opec-oil-price-grip-loosen-iea/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_12_success_equal-pay-day-2024", "text": "March 12 marks Equal Pay Day in the United States, a symbolic date representing the number of days women have to work into the current year just to make the same amount of money men made in the prior one. Put another way, to make 12 months\u2019 worth of a man\u2019s median wages, a woman has to work about 14.5 months. In dollars and cents, for every dollar a man earns, a woman is paid 84 cents, according to the National Committee on Pay Equity and the Equal Pay Today campaign. That\u2019s based on earnings data for full-time, year-round workers from the US Census in 2022, which was the most recent full-year data set available. If part-time workers and those not employed year-round are included, the gender pay gap is worse, at 78 cents on the dollar, said Deborah Vagins, national campaign director of Equal Rights Advocates and director of Equal Pay Today. The size of the actual wage gap between men and women will widen or narrow depending on age, level of education, choice of occupation and tenure, as well as race and ethnicity. The gender pay gap is typically widest when comparing the earnings of White men to Black, Hispanic or Native American women. And, generally speaking, the gap is narrower in a given job when men and women are in their early- to mid-20s (i.e., when they are new to the workforce and before children come along), and also when comparing wages by title, tenure and education level within a given field. But no matter how you slice and dice the data, there are very few scenarios in which women on average earn the same as men. Indeed, in its latest analysis of median weekly earnings last year by occupation, the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research found that women earned less than men not only in all 20 of the largest occupations for men but also in all 20 of the largest occupations for women. Among the largest occupations for women, the most egregious pay gaps were among financial managers (women earned 71% of every dollar a man earns), retail salesperson (72%), education and child care administrators (79%), administrative assistants (80%) and managers (81%). The narrowest gap was among cashiers, where women almost have pay parity (98%) with their male colleagues. Same old (and annoying) story every year While the overall gender pay gap has been narrowing over time \u2014 for example, Equal Pay Day in 2005 was April 19, a full five weeks later than this year\u2019s \u2014 the very fact that \ufeffsuch a gap exists at all in 2024 is a reminder that employers and society still have work to do in recognizing the value of women\u2019s contributions at work. \u201cThe gender wage gap is a national disgrace,\u201d said\u00a0Jamila Taylor, IWPR\u2019s president and CEO, in a statement. \u201cEven in professions typically dominated by women, men earn more for doing the same job. Equal pay for equal work has been the law of the land for more than a half-century, yet\u00a0women still cannot get fair treatment when it comes to employment and earnings. And it\u2019s worse for women of color, who face rampant racial discrimination in the workforce in addition to ongoing pay inequities.\u201d The good news is that there are now multiple efforts that may over time help reduce the problem. They include an increasing number of state-level pay transparency laws and bans on employers asking job candidates for their salary histories, which can help chronically underpaid women gain more of an equal footing when they apply for new jobs. There is also now a ban on federal government agencies asking job candidates\u2019 for their salary history and a proposed rule that would prohibit federal contractors from doing the same, as well as requiring them to post in their job ads the pay for given positions. But Vagins and others in the campaign for equal pay also want to see action at the federal legislative level, supporting two bills: the Salary Transparency Act and the Paycheck Fairness Act, which have been introduced in the US House and Senate multiple times. For instance, the Paycheck Fairness Act would, according to Equal Pay Today, \u201cbar retaliation against workers who voluntarily discuss or disclose their wages; close loopholes that have allowed employers to pay women less than men for the same work \u2026 [and] ensure women can receive the same robust remedies for sex-based pay discrimination that are currently available to those subjected to discrimination based on race and ethnicity.\u201d Absent such federal laws requiring all employers to make equal pay more of an imperative, Vagins said, achieving true pay parity for women will be slow in coming.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/12/success/equal-pay-day-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2022_04_25_business_electric-hybrid-corvette", "text": "General Motors will produce a fully electric Chevrolet Corvette, GM President Mark Reuss announced in a LinkedIn post Monday morning.  Reuss didn\u2019t say when the electric Corvette would come, but he hinted that a hybrid model could come relatively soon. \u201cWe will offer an electrified Corvette as early as next year,\u201d he wrote. An accompanying video the company posted to Twitter showed what appeared to be a hybrid Corvette, and in another first, showed the front wheels spinning and throwing snow as if being powered. All Corvettes produced by the company previously have been rear-wheel-drive only. While Reuss\u2019s post implies a hybrid Corvette will be based on the current generation of the car, it\u2019s not clear if the all-electric version will be a variation of this car or a completely different future model. \u201cElectrified\u201d is an auto industry term encompassing everything from hybrid to fully electric vehicles, and anything with an electric motor can count as \u201celectrified.\u201d It has long been rumored that the current generation of the Corvette, the first with its gasoline engine mounted behind the seats instead of in the front, could be built with a hybrid system. Reuss has also previously hinted there would be electrified variants of the car. Various companies are working on electric sports cars. Most all-electric vehicles in production so far have been four-door sedans and SUVs, as the need for batteries lends itself to larger and heavier vehicles. Tesla\u2019s first car, the Lotus Elise-based Tesla Roadster, was an electric sports car, but the second-generation of Tesla Roadster, originally unveiled as a prototype in 2017, has yet to go into production. Some manufacturers, such as Lamborghini, have said that current battery technology doesn\u2019t allow for a optimum sports car performance from a purely electric vehicle. Lamborghini has been working on plug-in hybrid sports cars, though. To date, the Corvette is only available in the base Stingray version with 6.2-liter V8 engine producing up to 495 horsepower. A 670 horsepower Corvette Z06 with a 5.5-liter V8 was unveiled last fall. The previous generation of the Corvette included included a 755-horsepower ZR1 version. Nothing like that has yet been announced for the current model but GM engineers have said a major reason for putting the engine in the back was to allow for better performance at extremely high horsepower levels. Besides saving gas, hybrid systems can also be used in high-performance cars to add additional power and to provide for quicker acceleration since electric motors can provide power to the wheels more quickly than gas engines. Ferrari\u2019s most powerful sports cars are hybrids, for instance.   GM has said it plans to produce only zero-emission vehicles, meaning fully electric or powered by hydrogen fuel cells, by 2035.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/25/business/electric-hybrid-corvette/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_07_business_adults-preschoolers-toy-buying", "text": "Adults bought more toys for themselves than for any other age group last quarter for the first time ever, surpassing toys for even the historically-dominant preschooler market.  Consumers 18 years of age and up spent $1.5 billion in toy-related purchases in the period from January through April, overtaking the three-to five-year-old demographic as the most important age group for the toy industry, according to a new report from market research firm Circana. Looking back over a longer period, the report said as many as 43% of adults purchased a toy for themselves in the past year, with the top reasons being for personal fun, socialization and for collecting. Trading cards, Squishmallows (which are a rage across age groups), Lego sets and sports toys were among the most sought-after toy products in the period, the report said. As adults play with toys more and more, the trend bodes well to counter the decline in overall toy sales. Circana said toy industry dollar sales declined by 1% through April, versus the same period a year ago but are still up 38% compared to 2019. \u201cTailwinds, like the growing adult toy market and spending power of higher income households and grandparents, drive positive trends,\u201d Juli Lennett, vice president and toy industry advisor at Circana, said in the report. \u201cHowever, headwinds like rising household debt, slowing GDP growth, and fluctuating consumer confidence indicate potential challenges. \u201c Key part of \u2018adulting\u2019 involves toys While adults have always bought toys for themselves, fueled by the collector market for brands like Barbie and Hot Wheels, that niche market, industry experts said, has gone mainstream in the last five years. The pandemic was an important catalyst for it. \u201cDuring the pandemic, when people were flush with cash and had time to spend at home whether with their families or alone, they wanted to reconnect with the toys that made them happy as kids,\u201d said James Zahn, Editor in Chief of industry trade publication The Toy Book, in an interview with CNN. But people who were already toy collectors by that point ramped up their interest. \u201cWe\u2019re talking everything, dolls, action figures and diecast vehicles,\u201d he said. \u201cOutside of collectibles, boardgames, Lego building sets, trading cards, which are extraordinarily hot again, are also firing up adult interest.\u201d Some toymakers, he said, are now introducing new products straight for the adult population. \u201cJanuary Through April, in the actions figure category, the top two new items that came out were both items that kids are not going to buy,\u201d Zahn said. \u201cThe No. 1 item is the X-Men 97 Marvel Legends action figure collection from Hasbro, inspired by an animated series geared towards an adult audience.\u201d The second buzziest new item in the period is a Star Wars The Black Series Clone Caption Rex role play helmet from Hasbro. \u201cIt is a $130 collectible that essentially looks like a movie prop,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, old-fashioned modeling kits that were once popular with older shoppers have been replaced by Lego sets. \u201cThat very therapeutic idea of sitting down to create something of your own as an adult has a new format from a traditional model kit to a building set,\u201d Zahn set. \u201cLego gets a ton of that 18 and older market.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/business/adults-preschoolers-toy-buying/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_success_saving-under-high-interest-rates", "text": "Editor\u2019s Note: This is an updated version of an article that originally ran on May 1. As was widely expected, the Federal Reserve left its benchmark interest rate unchanged for its seventh meeting in a row on Wednesday. People carrying variable-rate debt like credit cards and those seeking a loan won\u2019t be happy given that the Fed\u2019s rate, which directly and indirectly affects consumers\u2019 borrowing costs, remains at a 23-year high. Those rates will likely stay high for a while. At this point, only one cut is seen as likely before the end of the year, according to US central bankers\u2019 latest summary of economic projections. But whenever the cuts start, they may be small. \u201cAbsent a complete about-face from the economy, interest rates aren\u2019t likely to come down soon enough, or fast enough, to provide meaningful relief to borrowers. Utilize zero-percent credit card balance transfer offers, shop around for lower fixed-rate personal loans and home equity loans, and channel as much income as possible toward paying down this debt as quickly as possible,\u201d said Greg McBride, Bankrate.com\u2019s chief financial analyst. But the Fed\u2019s decision leaves savers, once again, in the catbird seat when it comes to making money on their money. \u201cSavers are enjoying the best returns on savings accounts and CDs in more than 15 years, with the most competitive offers outpacing inflation. In addition, these conditions are poised to persist for the foreseeable future,\u201d McBride said. Online high-yield savings accounts The best bang for your savings can still be had in online high-yield savings accounts at FDIC-insured banks, which yield way more than today\u2019s 0.58% overall average savings rate. As of June 11, the average online savings account rate was 4.40%, according to DepositAccounts.com. And many online high-yield accounts continue to offer rates of 5% or more. Say you have $10,000 in savings. If you leave it parked in a regular savings account at 0.5%, you\u2019ll get $50 in interest for a year. If you put it instead in a 5% high-yield account, you\u2019ll get $500. A high-yield savings account is the best place to park money you\u2019ll need to cover emergencies as well as anticipated large expenses that you have to pay in the next three months to a year. As with any savings account, banks can lower the rate they offer \u2014 also known as the APY \u2014 at any time. And you can be sure they will do just that when the Fed looks like it will finally start cutting rates, McBride said. But, he added, since rates are likely to be cut in small increments, online high-yield savings accounts may continue to offer inflation-beating returns for some time. \u201cThey will still offer the best way to preserve your [money\u2019s] buying power,\u201d McBride said. Money market accounts and money market funds Money market deposit accounts and money market mutual funds are generating yields competitive with the best high-yield savings accounts. But there are important differences. Money market deposit accounts are bank products. So, assuming your bank is FDIC insured, your account is too. (Or, if your account is at a federally backed credit union, your money will be\u00a0insured by the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund.) As with high-yield accounts, you may get the best deals at an online bank. But money market accounts may have a higher minimum deposit requirement than a high-yield account. Money market funds, by contrast, are an investment product \u2014 they generate return by investing in short-term, low-risk debt instruments and are currently yielding an average of 5.12%, according to the Crane 100 Money Fund Index. Such funds are a good place to park cash you have in your brokerage account that you may want to use at some point to buy equities or bonds, McBride said. Money market funds are not FDIC-insured, but any brokerage you use should be insured by the\u00a0Securities Investor Protection Corporation, which\u00a0covers your funds up to a limit if your brokerage ever goes under. Certificates of deposit CDs are still a great place to park any money you can leave untouched for a fixed\u00a0period of time \u2014 anywhere from a few months to five years or longer. As of June 11, the average rate was 4.971% on an online one-year CD, and 3.815% on a five-year CD, according to DepositAccounts.com. While your brick-and-mortar bank may offer a CD at a good rate, you may get a better one shopping around. The easiest way to do that without having to set up an additional account at another bank is to shop for CDs through your online brokerage, which is likely to offer a wide array of CDs from many different banks. At Schwab.com, for instance, CDs on offer ranging in duration from three months all the way up to 10 years offered average annual returns over 5%, with most ranging between 5.30% and 5.45%. The highest annual average was 5.56% for a three-month CD. If you have to withdraw money before the end of a CD\u2019s term, you can always get all of your principal back but may forfeit some of the interest earned as an early withdrawal penalty. Treasury bills and notes Beyond deposit accounts, investing in short-term Treasury bills and intermediate-term Treasury notes has been another way to earn a competitive return with virtually no risk since Treasuries are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. Treasury bills come in six different maturities: 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 13 weeks, 17 weeks, 26 weeks and 52 weeks. Treasury notes mature in two, three, five, seven or 10 years. \u201cAs long as the Fed holds its rate in the 5.25% to 5.5% range, we expect most Treasury bill yields to hover around 5.25% as well,\u201d said Collin Martin, fixed income strategist at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. But, Martin added, \u201cWhile the timing of rate cuts has been pushed back, we still expect them to arrive later this year, and investors in short-term investments would likely face reinvestment risk.\u201d That\u2019s why he suggests investors consider buying some intermediate-term investments now before rates are cut if they want to lock in a higher yield for some of their money, such as Treasury notes maturing in the next four to 10 years. On Wednesday, yields on Treasury bills were north of 5% and yields on Treasury notes were north of 4%, according to Schwab.com. When deciding whether it makes sense to invest in a CD or a Treasury for the same duration, you might opt for the Treasury if you live in a high-tax state, McBride suggested, since interest on Treasuries is\u00a0exempt from state and local taxes. In all instances, the easiest way to purchase Treasuries and other bonds is to do so through your brokerage account.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/success/saving-under-high-interest-rates/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_27_media_nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over", "text": "Only 80 hours elapsed between NBC News announcing Ronna McDaniel as a paid contributor and the network ousting her from that very role. But for the leadership at NBC Universal News Group, those were 80\u00a0painful hours. On Tuesday evening, following another full day in which the media rumor mill churned at warp speed, NBCU News Group boss Cesar Conde sent staff a memo, notifying his troops that he had reversed his decision to welcome the former Republican National Committee chair to \u201cthe team.\u201d \u201cAfter listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor,\u201d Conde said, adding that he wanted to \u201cpersonally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down.\u201d Conde had no real choice. The embattled NBCU boss, who I\u2019m told dealt with the crisis from an unknown location outside of 30 Rock, was facing an unprecedented rebellion from his most high-profile stars, who one by one went on the air and excoriated leadership\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel. The only aspect of Conde\u2019s note that was surprising was the fact that it came 48 hours late, allowing what started off as a crisis to fester and balloon into one of the worst corporate public relations calamities in recent memory. \u201cWhat a sh*t show!\u201d a media executive exclaimed to me Tuesday shortly after Conde relieved McDaniel of her NBC News credentials. In his note, Conde said he took \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for McDaniel\u2019s hire. But, he also did point the finger, telling staffers that hiring her was \u201ca collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team.\u201d Indeed, multiple people familiar with the matter have told me that the infighting among NBC executives over who was at fault for the disaster has reached a fever pitch, with various factions of the NBCU News Group assigning blame to others. Regardless of who is to blame, the entire affair made clear who is actually in control of the company \u2014 and it\u2019s not Conde & Co. Despite the NBCU C-suite digging their heels in the sand as they resisted dumping McDaniel for days, they were ultimately forced to succumb to pressure from their talent. As a second media executive commented to me, it is now \u201cvery clear who is in charge\u201d after the \u201cweak leadership was put on full display.\u201d \u201cHas Cesar lost the room?\u201d wondered a third media executive. While the Peacock family argues over who was really at fault, the company is facing a fresh public relations mess. Led by Donald Trump, right-wing personalities are already assailing the network as being overrun with intolerant woke leftists. \u201cThese Radical Left Lunatics are CRAZY and the top people at NBC ARE WEAK,\u201d Trump raged on his Truth Social platform. Ari Fleischer, who served as press secretary under President George W. Bush, wrote on X: \u201cWhat NBC is saying is if you\u2019re for Trump, you don\u2019t belong. Good. Let NBC be for Democrats only.\u201d Of course, that narrative is intellectually dishonest. The objection to McDaniel from both within and outside of NBCU was not that she is a Republican. It wasn\u2019t even that she was a Trump-supporting Republican. No, the objection stemmed from the fact that McDaniel was an active participant in the plot to subvert the 2020 vote. And, in addition to that disgraceful history, she had a lengthy track record smearing NBC News and MSNBC. Nevertheless, NBCU will now have to contend with such dishonest attacks being leveled by the right, which will follow them in the days, months, and even years to come. As unfair as it may be, they will certainly damage the network\u2019s brand in Republican circles \u2014 a place it had gone through great pains to appeal to. NBCU will also have to grapple with McDaniel, who spent the last 24 hours or so interviewing lawyers as she gears up for a possible legal fight with the network, according to a person familiar with the matter. The rift between McDaniel and NBCU had grown to such an extent by Tuesday that she was not informed by network brass that she had been dismissed, I\u2019m told. Instead, McDaniel learned of her ouster in press reports. While NBCU is being beaten up on the right, the company\u2019s leadership was quickly praised by its journalists and top stars. Shortly after Conde sent out his memo, Rachel Maddow appeared on Joy Reid\u2019s show, where the two lauded Conde for reversing course. \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/27/media/nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2022_04_27_business_diamonds-manmade-demand", "text": "It\u2019s proposal season, and engagements are on the rise. So are factory-made diamond sales. Not that you\u2019d know the difference. Man-made diamonds look the same as naturally occurring ones. The only noticeable difference is the price tag. \u201cThe result is really stunning,\u201d said Edahn Golan, an independent diamond industry analyst. He said March data showed the number of engagement rings sold that featured a manufactured diamond jumped 63% compared to last year, while the number of engagement rings sold with a natural diamond declined 25% in the same period. Going back by another month, to February, the data showed the number of rings sold with lab diamonds that month surged even more, to 80% compared to a year earlier while the number fell by 13% for natural diamond engagement rings.  \u201cThe big fear in the natural diamonds industry is that consumers will start accepting lab-grown diamonds in engagement rings,\u201d he said. Too late. \u201cIt\u2019s actually happening.\u201d  Tide is shifting Why are consumers flocking to man-made diamonds? Cost is the most obvious reason. The average retail price of the most popular one carat round man-made diamond for an engagement ring in March was $2,318, Golan said. \u201cThis is substantially less \u2013 as much as 73% cheaper \u2013 than a natural diamond of the same size, cut and clarity as the man-made diamond, which would cost $8,740,\u201d he said. Plus, the lower cost allows couples to buy a bigger stone.  \u201cA lab diamond is a real diamond, but maybe it took a few weeks to make it,\u201d said Golan. \u201cNatural diamonds were formed over 800 million to three billion years and there isn\u2019t an infinite supply of them.\u201d  This makes natural diamonds quite a bit more expensive, and prices are likely to rise as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has tightened the supply chain for natural raw diamonds. The sanctions directly target Alrosa, partly owned by the Russian government, which the US government identified as the world\u2019s largest diamond mining company, accounting for 28% of global diamond output. Man-made diamonds are also becoming popular as consumers are more aware and educated about them, said Dan Moran, a third-generation diamond expert and owner of LA-based fine jeweler Concierge Diamonds. Moran said the typical buyer of man-made diamonds is typically younger than 40 and very budget conscious. Mined diamonds have a controversial history that\u2019s tied to the use of child labor in some African diamond mines as well as sales of illegally-traded \u201cconflict diamonds\u201d that fund conflict in war-torn areas. Among Millennials and Gen Z, their eco-conscious mindset and ethical concerns about natural diamond sourcing is another factor influencing their preference for non-traditional engagement rings, according to a report from wedding planning website The Knot. Small but growing share of the diamond market Although its slice is growing, the market share for man-made diamonds remains relatively small. Currently, about 7% of the specialty diamond jewelry market is represented by man-made diamonds, up from 3% in 2020, said Golan.  Some major jewelry retailers are driving the effort to take man-made diamonds mainstream. In 2021, the world\u2019s largest jewelry company, Pandora\n            \n                (PANDY), made a major shift by announcing it would stop using mined diamonds and would swap to lab-created diamonds in its jewelry.  Pandora said it\u2019s instituting the change as part of an effort to sell sustainable jewelry, and also because consumers increasingly are asking for it. Signet,\n            \n                (SIG) the largest jewelry company in the United States (which owns Zales, Kay Jewelers and Jared chains) called out the popularity of lab diamond jewelry in its March earnings call with analysts. Calling it a \u201cfast-growing category\u201d in its jewelry portfolio, Signet CEO Virginia Drosos told analysts that lab-created diamonds are among the big jewelry trends she expects this year.  The company said it has expanded its man-made bridal jewelry selection in both its Zales and Kay Jewelers stores in response to the increased demand.  Fine jewelry brand Charles and Colvard, which makes lab-created diamonds, said consumers don\u2019t just want to look good with the jewelry they are wearing, they also want to feel good about it. \u201cAs the momentum for conscious consumerism grows, the surge towards lab grown diamonds isn\u2019t surprising,\u201d said Don O\u2019Connell, president and CEO of Charles & Colvard. \u201c[Consumers] want to know the origins of their stones and be reassured they\u2019re conflict-free. They\u2019re embracing the choice to purchase a piece of fine jewelry that aligns with their values.\u201d Lab-grown diamond brand VRAI said the pandemic, too, has sparked attention and action toward social and environmental issues. It said consumers are being more thoughtful and reassessing their purchasing habits, as well as the companies and industries they are supporting. There is, however, one important consideration for anyone buying lab-created diamonds: Man-made diamonds have little resale value.  So while you may not be able to tell a natural diamond from a factory made variety, someone with a trained eye can, said Golan. Once a stone is identified as a factory diamond, even though you paid a lot less for it, you also won\u2019t get much for it.  But the value of a ring isn\u2019t just monetary. \u201cAs a professional in the industry, I am asked all the time by people about what I think about a ring they have,\u201d said Moran, of Concierge Jewelers. \u201cI always say, if you love it, be happy with it. An engagement ring is a symbol of commitment and enduring love.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/27/business/diamonds-manmade-demand/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_08_tech_apple-wwdc-event-2024", "text": "Apple is on the verge of kicking off perhaps its most important event in years as it faces a gauntlet of challenges. At its annual Worldwide Developers Conference starting Monday, the company is widely expected to announce a partnership with ChatGPT maker OpenAI and unveil the first batch of generative AI tools coming to its mobile operating system. A big push into AI could spur growth for iPhone sales and services for years to come, as users are now waiting longer to upgrade their devices and an uncertain economic environment weighs on consumers, particularly in China. The company also faces regulatory scrutiny in Washington and was passed this week by chip maker Nvidia as the second-largest public company in the US. \u201cWe see generative AI as a key opportunity across our products and believe we have advantages that set us apart there,\u201d Apple CEO Tim Cook said on the company\u2019s most recent earnings call in early May, noting the company would announce news in the \u201cweeks ahead.\u201d The timing is also noteworthy: Apple is not always first to adopt and integrate emerging technologies \u2014 it typically researches, develops and aims to perfect new tech for years before including it in new products \u2014 but the speed at which the world is adopting generative AI is perhaps expediting the company\u2019s need to have a smartphone with the most cutting-edge technology. According to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, the company going all in on AI will \u201ckick off a new frontier for Apple\u201d \u2013 one that will have a lasting impact on its products and services. Here\u2019s a closer look at what to expect at Apple\u2019s big event: AI, AI and more AI Apple is expected to call its AI initiative \u201cApple Intelligence\u201d and make opt-in only. It will require an iPhone 15 Pro or a device with an M1 chip or newer, according to a new report by Bloomberg. Perhaps the most obvious way Apple could embrace generative AI \u2013 the buzzy form of artificial intelligence that can provide thoughtful and thorough responses to questions \u2013 is through Siri, the company\u2019s virtual assistant with a hit-or-miss track record. An integration with OpenAI\u2019s latest ChatGPT-4o model could catapult Siri years forward by turning the feature into an iPhone chatbot. This could enable Siri to perform specific tasks such as recalling a picture taken years ago on the device or answering detailed questions about the weather, the news or trivia. Over time, it could learn the user\u2019s preferences and even personality, and respond accordingly. Looking at how competitors have already introduced generative tools, AI-powered features for the iPhone could also likely assist users with summarizing and drafting emails or bringing information up on a device\u2019s screen with a finger gesture. It will also likely adapt automatically and seamlessly to users, based on voice, audio and natural language, along with images and contextual cues. \u201cGenerative AI will allow the next generations of iPhones to become a sixth sense, empowering us to scan and interact with the world around us,\u201d Thomas Husson, an analyst with market research firm Forrester, told CNN. It could also mean changes for Apple\u2019s whole ecosystem by embedding AI within its own apps, such as Apple Maps, iMovie and iPhoto. Some analysts expect Apple to release tools for brand developers and app makers to create new experiences. Reece Hayden, a senior analyst at ABI Research, said he expects the demos during the event to highlight points where on-device AI brings additional value. He also believes Apple will spend time outlining its long-term vision. \u201cAI will increasingly be foundational to Apple\u2019s entire strategic focus, so it will highlight the R&D efforts moving forward, expected investment and acquisitions that the company has made to support their proposition,\u201d he said. A strategic partnership In the spring, Apple was reportedly discussing partnership opportunities with both OpenAI and Google to power its AI tools. But now the company is believed to have inked a deal with the ChatGPT creator, a partnership Apple could elaborate on during the opening keynote on Monday. \u201cIf OpenAI is responsible for powering Apple\u2019s AI capabilities, I would expect a formal partnership announcement as consumers and enterprises want to understand the regulation and rules and what they are signing up for and how their data is being utilized,\u201d Hayden said. Although the partnership would give the company a much-needed innovation boost, it could also hinder Apple\u2019s control over product development and over the rules and regulation on data collection and privacy, Hayden said. Apple aligning itself with a company and a technology that have yet to win public trust could pose some risks for Apple down the line. OpenAI continues to face criticism over some of its practices. This week, a group of current and former OpenAI employees demanded artificial intelligence companies be far more transparent about AI\u2019s \u201cserious risks\u201d \u2014 and that they protect employees who voice concerns about the technology they\u2019re building. The group called for AI companies to foster \u201ca culture of open criticism\u201d that welcomes, rather than punishes, people who speak up about their concerns, especially as regulation struggles to catch up to the quickly advancing technology. A focus on privacy and security Apple has been long focused on consumer privacy and security, and that will likely also be reflected in Monday\u2019s announcements. Companies have acknowledged the serious risks posed by AI \u2014 from manipulation and the spread of misinformation to a loss of control that could potentially result in human extinction. Many researchers and AI workers have expressed the need to better educate the public about risks and protective measures. Apple will need to address how using this type of technology will impact consumers. Vision Pro update Apple will likely provide an update to its Vision Pro mixed reality headset, which was announced one year ago this week and released for purchase in February. During its most recent earnings call, CEO Tim Cook said more than half of the Fortune 100 companies have already bought an Apple Vision Pro. \u201c[We] are exploring innovative ways to use it to do things that weren\u2019t possible before,\u201d he added. Generative AI could potentially propel the headset into another level of personalization and immersion and usher in new use cases for businesses, particularly in the education and medical spaces. Tuong Nygugen, a director analyst at market research firm Gartner, said any company interested in headsets \u201chas to be thinking about [AI]\u201d across all of its product lines. \u201cNobody really knows what\u2019s a winner yet, so they\u2019re pulling together all these use cases right now, with a focus on enterprise, and making a case for why this is the future of experiences and devices,\u201d he said. Upgrades could also boost sales of the pricey Vision Pro, which starts at $3,499 and has reportedly seen weak demand.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/08/tech/apple-wwdc-event-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "business"}}

Alamo Drafthouse, headquartered in Austin, Texas, has 35 theaters in 25 metro areas. It rose to popularity and has a passionate fanbase due to its dine-in and cocktail menus and its reputation as an oasis for film buffs with its strict no-talking rules. But despite being a fan favorite, it was hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic. It filed for bankruptcy in March 2021 and began closing locations.

{"id": "2024_03_26_media_nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash", "text": "Cesar Conde has a decision to make \u2014 and it\u2019s not an especially difficult one. The NBCUniversal News Group chair is facing a torrent of backlash from his own staff after greenlighting the hire of former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel as a paid network contributor. Over the last 24 hours, the most prominent and recognizable NBC News and MSNBC personalities have voiced strong displeasure with the company\u2019s decision to welcome McDaniel to \u201cthe team.\u201d And they\u2019re not doing it via anonymous comments to the press. They\u2019re doing it on the record on NBCU\u2019s own air. Chuck Todd broke the dam on Sunday\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with a set of candid comments about the hiring, and Rachel Maddow capped the flood of backlash Monday night with a blistering 30-minute monologue eviscerating the network\u2019s leadership for the \u201cinexplicable\u201d move. Suffice to say, NBCU News Group is in unprecedented territory. Never has a network\u2019s C-suite ever been so thoroughly flogged by its most high-profile stars in such no holds barred fashion. Saying that Conde simply has a crisis on his hands would be a contender for understatement of the year. It\u2019s a five-alarm fire at NBCU News Group, and one of Conde\u2019s own making. While NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown were most directly responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring, a decision that MSNBC boss Rashida Jones did not object to it at the time, the buck ultimately stops with Conde, who hold the real power at the Peacock Network. McDaniel\u2019s hiring could not have happened without Conde\u2019s blessing. It does not take a brilliant political mind with prescient foresight to understand that hiring McDaniel would ignite a firestorm of outrage \u2014 from both within 30 Rock and outside it. Conde, someone who ostensibly supports American democracy, should have rejected McDaniel\u2019s hiring on the grounds that NBCU News Group could not put someone on its payroll who tried to subvert the 2020 vote. As so many of NBCU\u2019s staffers have underscored, the objection to McDaniel is not that she is a Republican. It\u2019s not even that she is a Donald Trump-supporting Republican. It\u2019s that she was an active participant in the plot to overthrow the last presidential election. That is not to even mention McDaniel\u2019s years of demonizing the press, smearing the journalists who work at NBC News and MSNBC as she sought to destroy the credibility of the organization that she ran to after being chased out of the RNC. The notion put forward by NBC that it needed to hire McDaniel to bring its viewers \u201can insider\u2019s perspective on national politics and the future of the Republican Party\u201d is absurd. If that\u2019s the case, the network should move to hire free agents like Tucker Carlson or Candace Owens. They too have their hands on the pulse of the Republican Party. In fact, they represent much more of where the GOP stands today than McDaniel. So, using NBC\u2019s logic, why not hire them? (Spoiler: News organizations rightfully have established basic standards for paid contributors. Asking that your employees have a commitment to democracy, to the truth, and to basic decency is not a big ask.) But even if Conde has no allegiance to basic democratic principles, which this hire calls into question, given that he is known to be a political player who cares deeply about his own image in the press, he should have been wise enough to foresee that hiring McDaniel would be an ill-conceived move. How this did not occur to Conde is unfathomable and shows a tremendous lack of judgment. Even more bizarre is Conde\u2019s management, or lack thereof, since the controversy erupted. It was clear early on that his employees at NBC News and MSNBC did not support McDaniel\u2019s hiring. If that was not evident on Friday, it was clear as day on Sunday after \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d The network\u2019s employees were not only flabbergasted and demoralized by the move, but absolutely enraged by it. At that point, the writing should have been on the wall for Conde \u2014 as it was for every other media executive that I have spoken with over the last 24 hours. It is evident that McDaniel has no real future as an NBC analyst and the decision to bring her on as a contributor will have to be reversed. After all, which NBC or MSNBC program is going to invite her on after all of this? The only real question for Conde after the Sunday morning scolding should have been how he chose to back out of the deal in the least painful way possible. To be fully honest, I very much expected a Sunday evening announcement from NBC, one that would have earned praise from the company\u2019s staff and quickly been swept away by the rush of Trump news Monday morning. But no such announcement came. Instead, Conde has allowed the mess to spiral absolutely out of control. MSNBC\u2019s top stars hammered the network\u2019s leadership throughout the day Monday over the hire. NBC News\u2019 Guild blasted Conde, saying in a statement that under him the company had quietly laid off employees over the last month and instead chosen to \u201cprioritize an election denier over its reporters.\u201d The already severe crisis was allowed to blossom into one of the worst corporate public relations catastrophes in recent memory. All the while, Conde has remained silent. I asked his spokesperson, Stephen Labaton, on Monday whether the NBCU News Group boss had any comment on the situation. Does he have any regret? I didn\u2019t get an on-the-record response. Suffice to say, however, that what Conde does moving forward will say a lot about his character and commitment to democratic values. It will also say a lot about the NBCU News Group and what type of organization it is. In her biting monologue on Monday night, however, Maddow did offer Conde a way out of this mess. \u201cMistakes will be made,\u201d Maddow said.\u201dBut our resilience as a democracy is going to be recognizing when decisions are bad ones and reversing those bad decisions. Hearing legitimate criticism, responding to it, and correcting course. Not digging in. Not blaming others. Take a minute. Acknowledge that maybe it wasn\u2019t the right call.\u201d \u201cIt is a sign of strength, not weakness, to acknowledge when you are wrong,\u201d Maddow added. \u201cIt is a sign of strength. And our country needs us to be strong now.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/media/nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_21_opinions_sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic", "text": "The biggest tech news this week is the\u00a0ouster\u00a0of Sam Altman from his role as CEO of OpenAI, a move that has shaken the company and the industry. Hundreds of OpenAI employees have threatened to\u00a0resign. Altman has already\u00a0moved on\u00a0to a role at Microsoft. And OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is on its\u00a0third CEO\u00a0in as many days. It\u2019s all very juicy. But this drama should also be raising larger questions, far beyond one company\u2019s internal hirings and firings, including: Who are the people making the decisions\u00a0that will determine so much of our technological future? What guiding principles are they using to make those decisions? And how should other institutions \u2013 governments, non-tech industries, global alliances, regulatory bodies \u2013 reign in the worst excesses of potentially dangerous AI innovators? OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, with an explicit mission to harness what may soon be superhuman intelligence \u201cto benefit humanity as a whole.\u201d But that sensibility hasn\u2019t lasted. The company now has a multi-billion-dollar for-profit arm. They have been developing new technologies at lightning speed, and sometimes sending them out to the public\u00a0before some employees believed they were ready. The company has already reportedly invented an AI technology so dangerous they will never release it \u2013 but they also\u00a0won\u2019t tell\u00a0reporters or the public exactly what it is. This dynamic \u2013 a potentially dangerous technology developed at extreme speed, largely behind closed doors \u2013 is partly to blame for Altman\u2019s firing. The OpenAI board, according to\u00a0CNN\u2019s David Goldman, worried that \u201cthe company was making the technological equivalent of a nuclear bomb, and its caretaker, Sam Altman, was moving so fast that he risked a global catastrophe.\u201d At particular issue seemed to be Altman\u2019s efforts to make the tools behind ChatGPT available to anyone who wanted to make their own version of the chatbot. This could be widely disastrous, some board members worried. But then they fired him without warning, and apparently without involving Microsoft, the company\u2019s largest shareholder. Now, Altman is at the new AI group at Microsoft, and one has to wonder if the oversight and caution there will be on par with that at OpenAI, or if he\u2019ll be handed carte blanche to push as fast and hard as he wants. And for all the justified reticence of the OpenAI board, the company has carried out much of its work in secrecy \u2013 without the public really understanding what a handful of unaccountable technologists are building, and how it is nearly guaranteed to indelibly change their lives. AI is broadly understood to have the potential to reshape vast swaths of human existence. At the very least, it seems nearly guaranteed to change how we process information, how we communicate, how we learn and how we work (and if we work). And the ramifications could be much more extreme. AI technologies have already demonstrated the ability\u00a0to lie and to cover their tracks. They have already been able to\u00a0suggest the design\u00a0to make a virus spread more quickly. Many researchers\u00a0acutely understand\u00a0just how quickly these machines could develop the capacity to annihilate us, including Altman: He has a prepper\u2019s paradise prepared in Big Sur, complete with guns and \u201cgas masks from the Israeli Defense Force\u201d in case AI goes off the rails and the robots go to war against humans,\u00a0according to reporting in the New Yorker. But don\u2019t worry, he told an Atlantic reporter: If AI is determined to wipe us out, \u201cno gas mask is helping anyone.\u201d (If you want an excellent and terrifying rundown of AI\u2019s risks \u2013 at least those we understand right now, which are almost certainly a mere sliver of the looming perils \u2013\u00a0the Atlantic profile of Altman and his technology\u00a0is worth a read). AI is very exciting technology. But it is also a potentially very dangerous one, and not in the social media sense of \u201cit may give us bad self-esteem and make us lonelier\u201d but in the sense of \u201cit could break down human societies and kill us all.\u201d Given the life-altering potential of AI \u2013 that even if it doesn\u2019t kill us all, it will almost certainly change human existence in unprecedented ways at unprecedented speed \u2013 we all have a stake in how it\u2019s being developed. And yet the development is being left to a handful of people (who seem to be\u00a0largely\u00a0men) in Silicon Valley, and other tech pockets around the globe. And we all have a stake in whose interests AI will serve \u2013 and right now, its development is being funded with billions of dollars by people expecting to make a huge profit. Do the interests of the public align with the interests of the shareholders to whom profit-driven, potentially tremendously lucrative-for-a-few companies are beholden? Or with the interests of tech entrepreneurs who are primarily excited about being at the forefront of the AI revolution, regardless of the potential human costs? One thing is clear: AI is coming. And how it is built and unleashed on the public matters more than perhaps any technology of the past century. It is, indeed, up there with the atom bomb in its destructive potential \u2013 except likely more difficult to regulate and control. \u201cRegulation\u201d does not begin to scratch the surface of what\u2019s needed to make sure that the AI future is not a catastrophic one, especially since the development of AI is now a massive international arms race, with particularly horrific implications if bad actors develop this technology first. But regulation is, at minimum, a necessary step. So is transparency: In the US, companies have wide leverage to work behind a veil of secrecy, and much of what AI companies do is kept secret to stymy competition. But the public certainly has a right to understand what life-altering technologies are set to be inflicted upon us, and what the creators are doing to protect humanity \u2013 our jobs, our communities, our families, our connections, our educations and our abilities to build a life of purpose, but also our lives and our safety. The Altman story is fascinating because Altman is the most powerful figure in AI technology, which in effect makes him one of the most powerful men in the world. But that should give us pause: Who is he, what power does he hold, what is he doing with it, who does he answer to, and are we comfortable with this much life-altering potential being held by a few unaccountable people?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/21/opinions/sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_08_business_red-lobster-black-history", "text": "Communities around the country are losing cheddar bay biscuits and all-you-can-eat seafood deals as troubled Red Lobster closes around 100 US restaurants, with up to 135 more closures looming. But Red Lobster\u2019s decline is particularly a loss for many Black diners, who formed a loyal base for the brand and still account for a higher share of customers than other major casual chain restaurants, according to historians, customers and former Red Lobster executives. \u201cRed Lobster cultivated Black customers. It has not shied away from that customer base like some brands have,\u201d Clarence Otis Jr., the former CEO of Darden Restaurants from 2004 to 2014, when the company still owned the chain, told CNN. After Otis became CEO, Sacramento Observer columnist Mardeio Cannon wrote that \u201cit is only fitting\u201d Red Lobster had a Black CEO because \u201cif there is any restaurant in America that most African Americans love, it\u2019s Red Lobster.\u201d In a 2015 presentation to investors, Red Lobster said 16% of customers were Black, two percentage points higher than the Black share of the US population. Red Lobster did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on current customer demographics. The chain hired Black workers and served Black guests from its beginnings in the South in the late 1960s, and Black celebrities such as Chris Rock and Nicki Minaj worked there before they became famous. (Minaj later joked about being fired from \u201call three or four\u201d of the Red Lobsters where she worked over \u201cLobsterita\u201d drinks and cheddar bay biscuits with Jimmy Fallon.) And Beyonc\u00e9 sang about taking a romantic partner to Red Lobster in her 2016 song \u201cFormation,\u201d which addresses police brutality, Hurricane Katrina and Black culture in America.  Red Lobster attracted both working-class and affluent Black diners during the 1970s and 1980s at a time when many sit-down restaurants were unwelcoming of Black patrons, said Marcia Chatelain, a professor of Africana studies at the University of Pennsylvania and author of \u201cFranchise: The Golden Arches in Black America,\u201d which explores the relationship between McDonald\u2019s and Black consumers. Red Lobster\u2019s early locations near shopping malls also helped it grow with Black customers, she said.  \u201cThe placement of Red Lobster outlets near shopping malls coincided with the opening of more retail options for African Americans after the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\u201d she said in an email. \u201cThis style of restaurant was appealing to people seeking a fine dining-like experience without dealing with the uncertainty of how they would be treated at local businesses.\u201d Civil rights mythology Founded by Bill Darden, Red Lobster was racially integrated when it opened in 1968 in Lakeland, Florida. Hiring and serving Black people was not a revolutionary step by Darden, and he certainly was far from the first to leap at the opportunity. But it was another marker of racial progress for Black people in Lakeland and the changing South. In Lakeland during the early 1960s, local civil rights activists picketed businesses and movie theaters that denied entry to Black patrons, forcing them to integrate. Although Red Lobster\u2019s opening came four years after passage of the Civil Rights Act mandating desegregation of public accommodations, many schools and businesses still were segregated. Some closed rather than integrate. Red Lobster was \u201calways very open and receptive to us,\u201d said Beverly Boatwright, who was active in the sit-in movement in Lakeland while attending the all-Black high school, along with her mother, a leader in the local branch of the NAACP. \u201cWe never had a problem at Red Lobster. There were other places where we did have struggles\u201d in the city. But Red Lobster was not immediately a popular spot with Black customers in Lakeland, and the mythology of Darden as a civil rights pioneer that has grown in recent years has been overstated. Red Lobster was not a \u201cplace we frequented a whole lot\u201d in its early days, said Harold Dwight, who graduated two years after Boatwright in 1968. Most Black residents did not have the means to go out to eat, Dwight said. When they did, they went to establishments run by Black owners and Morrison\u2019s Cafeteria, the largest cafeteria chain in the South, which had been integrated for several years and had more Black employees. In corporate lore, Darden\u2019s first restaurant, the Green Frog \u2014which opened in 1938 in Waycross, Georgia \u2014 was desegregated. Darden has been lauded in various articles as a \u201csocial crusader\u201d \u201cwho [stood] up to Jim Crow\u201d in \u201cdefiance\u201d of segregation laws. On Darden Restaurants\u2019 corporate website, the company mentions the Green Frog and says its founder \u201cwelcomed all guests to his tables.\u201d But the Green Frog did not welcome Black diners initially, according to Black people who grew up in Waycross and recall the Green Frog, which closed in the 1980s. John Fluker, a former mayor of Waycross, said Black people worked in the kitchen, but the Green Frog did not welcome Black customers. The Green Frog reflected the racial norms of the time in south Georgia, said Waycross resident Horace Thomas. \u201cThey didn\u2019t open the doors for Black people,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody was like that.\u201d Cultural appeal Although Black customers did not immediately frequent Red Lobster, the chain gradually built strength with Black patrons as it expanded in the South and across the country. Red Lobster developed a reputation for being friendly and open to Black customers, in part because it had Black staff when a new restaurant opened, and it later developed marketing strategies to court Black diners, say historians and former executives. Walter King, who was hired in 1971 to manage a Red Lobster restaurant, was one of the company\u2019s earliest Black employees and stayed with the chain for 36 years. Red Lobster later named one of its signature dishes after King: \u201cWalt\u2019s Favorite Shrimp.\u201d King died last year. \u201cThey\u2019ve been loyal to us and we\u2019ve been loyal to them,\u201d Beverly Boatwright said. \u201cWe went there because the food was delicious. It was the only place you could get good seafood. It was a luxury.\u201d Red Lobster\u2019s cuisine was also a major part of its popularity with Black diners. Outdoor fish fries with catfish, crawfish and other seafood have served as a popular tradition in Black communities, said Robyn Autry, a sociology professor at Wesleyan University who studies race and wrote recently on how Red Lobster\u2019s downfall \u201chits differently\u201d for Black communities. Red Lobster brought the \u201coutdoor fried fish experience\u201d indoors, Autry said. For many Black people, it became a \u201cmarker of status to move from outdoor fish fries to sitting down with menus and being served.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/08/business/red-lobster-black-history/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_07_economy_may-jobs-report-final", "text": "US job growth shot much higher than expected in May, jumping to 272,000, while the nation\u2019s jobless rate rose slightly and broke a 27-month streak of below-4% unemployment. At a time when Americans and the Federal Reserve are clamoring for clear-cut data about the state and trajectory of the economy, Friday\u2019s jobs report was much more opaque than everyone had hoped. \u201cIt\u2019s hard not to like a lot of jobs, and this report was well above what I expected, and I think just about what everyone expected,\u201d Dean Baker, an economist who co-founded the Center for Economic and Policy Research, told CNN. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot of job growth, that\u2019s a generally good story.\u201d He added: \u201cBut the Fed\u2019s going \u2018Oh, can we cut [interest rates]? Can we cut? Can we cut?\u2019 It\u2019s hard to look at this report and make a good case for cutting, I\u2019ve got to say.\u201d May\u2019s job gains are considerably higher than the April total, which was revised down to 165,000, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data released Friday. The May data came in well above expectations for 180,000, according to FactSet consensus estimates. The unemployment rate rose to 4% from 3.9%. It\u2019s the first time in more than two years that the jobless rate is not below 4%. Stronger-than-expected wage gains for the month pushed up average hourly earnings to 4.1% over the past year, reversing a monthslong trend of cooling there. \u201cThe Fed doesn\u2019t directly target wages; but where the wages picked up are in the areas where we\u2019ve seen the most inflation,\u201d Diane Swonk, chief economist with KPMG, told CNN. That\u2019s in the service sector, everything from personal care services, dry cleaning, cleaning and home maintenance and vehicle maintenance, she said. \u201cAnd that is something that is hard for the Fed, because in order for some of the increases we\u2019re seeing in the service sector, we need to see offset in goods prices in order to bring inflation down,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you need a lot of that consistently to deal with stickier inflation that we\u2019re seeing in the service sector; and, unfortunately, wages matter more in particular areas where inflation has gotten stickiest.\u201d Critical inflation data is due out Wednesday: The May Consumer Price Index lands the same day the Fed will make its latest policymaking announcement (which is overwhelmingly expected to be that they are keeping rates on hold). Traders weren\u2019t too giddy about Friday\u2019s\u00a0employment\u00a0report, at least when it comes to rate cut prospects. Wall Street\u2019s best bet for the first rate cut is now December, the CME FedWatch Tool shows. A tale of two surveys Friday\u2019s jobs report, at initial glance, appears to be a mixed bag both for Americans and the Fed, which is wanting to see a slowing in demand to help tamp down inflation. The strong job market has underpinned a robust period of consumer spending that has kept the economy churning \u2014 but has not necessarily helped in the inflation fight. The surge in job gains and the rising unemployment offer a tale of two surveys: The monthly\u00a0jobs\u00a0report is composed of two surveys to measure\u00a0employment\u00a0levels and activity, one that surveys non-farm businesses about\u00a0employment, hours and earnings, and the other of households to obtain the labor force status of the population with demographic details. Employment fell in the household survey, while unemployment increased to just shy of 6.5 million and pushing the unemployment rate to the threshold of 4%. However, the household survey typically is more volatile than the establishment survey that showed payroll gains jumping higher. \u201cIt is literally the height of confusion trying to make sense of one of the most divergent monthly employment reports that we can ever remember,\u201d economist Chris Rupkey, of FwdBonds, wrote in a note issued Friday. \u201cIs it safe out there for consumers and businesses or is the economy on the cusp of a recession?\u201d CEPR\u2019s Baker said the growing \u201cdissonance\u201d between the household and establishment surveys could be a reflection of the data not fully picking up the post-pandemic surge in immigration that economists say have increased the supply of workers and productivity, allowing for stronger job growth without being inflationary. \u201cThe immigrants are overwhelmingly working when they\u2019re coming here, and we have the data on that,\u201d Baker said. \u201cBut my best guess is we\u2019re not picking up the full impact of immigration with the population controls [of the BLS survey].\u201d Americans are still faring well Friday\u2019s jobs report may be a mixed bag at a time when the Fed is trying to rein in inflation; but from a historical standpoint, this current jobs market remains one for the record books. And from a current standpoint, one that\u2019s healthy for Americans who are trying their hardest to keep up with inflation. \u201cI think it still shows that there\u2019s still plenty of support within the labor market for people who depend on income for spending, which is obviously the vast majority of Americans,\u201d Thomas Simons, senior economist at Jefferies, said in an interview. Through May, the US economy has added an average of 247,800 jobs per month, which is roughly in line with the strong job growth seen last year. March\u2019s and April\u2019s estimated payroll gains were revised down slightly: March by 5,000 to 310,000; and April by 10,000 to 165,000. May marks the 41st consecutive month of job gains, extending what is the fifth longest streak on records that go back to 1939, BLS data shows. Service-providing industries accounted for the bulk of the month\u2019s job gains, with health care and social assistance continuing to lead the way, with 83,500 jobs added. Health care, government and leisure and hospitality accounted for 60% of May\u2019s gains; however, interest rate-sensitive sectors such as construction and manufacturing added jobs as well, Nick Bunker, economic research director for North America for the Indeed Hiring Lab, wrote in a note issued Friday. \u201cThe gains \ufeffare still broad-based,\u201d he said. The BLS\u2019 \u201cdiffusion index,\u201d which is a measurement of the percentage of industries that are adding or losing jobs, hit 63.4 in May, which is the highest it\u2019s been since January 2023. The labor market is still showing a lot of strength, Bunker said, noting that the increase in unemployment can be attributed to workers 24 and under, as prime-age employment rose. In fact, the labor force participation rate for prime working-age women (25-54 years old) set a fresh all-time high of 78.1% in May, BLS data shows. \u201cDon\u2019t get overly spooked by the rise in the unemployment rate,\u201d Bunker wrote. \u201cThe labor market is still gliding toward a soft landing.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/economy/may-jobs-report-final/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk", "text": "In a year of wild tech stories that has seen Elon Musk transform Twitter, cryptocurrency exchange FTX collapse and Silicon Valley Bank implode, this week\u2019s whiplash-inducing turmoil at OpenAI is among the most captivating. Sam Altman \u2014 the leader of one of the world\u2019s most influential AI companies, OpenAI, and perhaps the\u00a0most visible figure in the fledgling industry \u2014 was fired Friday night by the startup\u2019s directors in a surprise move. Less than five days later, he\u2019s back as the company\u2019s CEO, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. The series of extraordinary events unfolded just days after OpenAI held its\u00a0first-ever developer conference, where it laid out new, commercialized versions of its technology, including the option to customize its ChatGPT AI chatbot. If you\u2019re just catching up, here\u2019s what you missed from a week so incredible you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking the script could have been written by an early version of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Friday Around 3 p.m. ET, Altman joined a Google Meet call with most of OpenAI\u2019s board that had been convened by fellow co-founder and OpenAI chief scientist\u00a0Ilya Sutskever, during which Altman was fired and told that the news would soon be made public. Within the next half hour, the board also informed Greg Brockman, another co-founder and OpenAI president, that he would be removed from the board. Around 3:30 p.m. ET, OpenAI publicly announced that it had fired Altman over concerns that he was not always truthful with the board. The board said Mira Murati, the company\u2019s chief technology officer, would become interim CEO. OpenAI\u2019s strategic partners, including its biggest financial backer Microsoft, were also reportedly informed of Altman\u2019s ouster just minutes before the board\u2019s announcement. Hours after being fired, Altman posted on X that he \u201cloved working with such talented people\u201d and that he would have \u201cmore to say about what\u2019s next later.\u201d Brockman promptly quit. \u201cPlease don\u2019t spend any time being concerned. We will be fine,\u201d Brockman\u00a0said in a Friday post\u00a0on X. \u201cGreater things coming soon.\u201d A key factor in the CEO\u2019s firing was\u00a0tension between Altman, who favored developing AI\u00a0more aggressively, and members of the OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the unfolding events. Saturday Within 24 hours of Altman being fired, reports emerged that he and other ex-OpenAI loyalists were mulling plans for their own venture. OpenAI\u2019s board was also reportedly having second thoughts and considering asking the ousted CEO to return. Sunday By Sunday afternoon, Altman was\u00a0back at OpenAI\u2019s headquarters\u00a0\u2014 this time with a guest badge \u2014 to negotiate his potential return. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reportedly mediated the discussion. A 5 p.m. PT deadline was reportedly set for the board to agree to Altman\u2019s demands, including adding a seat for Microsoft, and reinstating him as CEO. But those talks broke down. As Sunday turned into Monday, Nadella tweeted that Altman, along with Brockman, would join Microsoft to run a new AI research group. At OpenAI, the group found a new interim CEO: Emmett Shear, the former CEO of Amazon\u2019s streaming service, Twitch. Murati would return to her role as OpenAI\u2019s chief technology officer. Monday In a post on X early Monday, Shear, who left his role at Twitch in March, described the chance to join OpenAI as \u201ca once-in-a-lifetime\u201d opportunity. He added that the company would hire an independent investigator to report on what happened in the lead-up to Altman\u2019s firing. But OpenAI employees were not convinced. More than 500 staffers signed an open letter calling on the company\u2019s board to resign and reinstate Altman and Brockman. They also threatened to follow the co-founders to Microsoft if their demands were not met. Altman posted on X, saying, \u201cwe have more unity and commitment and focus than ever before. we are all going to work together some way or other, and i\u2019m so excited. one team, one mission.\u201d The drama was far from over.\u00a0The Verge reported Monday afternoon\u00a0that Altman and Brockman could still return to OpenAI if the board members who fired him resign. And Nadella, speaking to CNBC, said he was \u201copen to both options\u201d when asked whether Altman would actually join Microsoft. \u201cLook, that is for the OpenAI board and management and the employees to choose,\u201d Nadella said. \u201cWe chose to explicitly partner with OpenAI and we want to continue to do so, and obviously, that depends on the people of OpenAI staying there or coming to Microsoft.\u201d Tuesday Altman\u00a0was reinstated late Tuesday as OpenAI\u2019s CEO, the company said on X. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman\u00a0wrote\u00a0that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his\u00a0post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it has backed with billions to bolster its ambitions in developing AI. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Nadella\u00a0said\u00a0on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_business_ceo-pay-poll-gallup", "text": "Americans are fed up with massive CEO pay packages. More than 8 in 10 (83%) Americans say it\u2019s important for businesses to avoid a major pay gap between CEOs and average employees, according to early findings from an upcoming Bentley University-Gallup poll shared exclusively with CNN. That includes 56% who say this issue is \u201cextremely important.\u201d And Americans continue to give corporations a failing grade when it comes to how they manage the yawning pay disparity. Just 13% say companies are doing a good or excellent job at avoiding a major pay gap between CEOs and average employees. For the third year in a row, the vast majority \u2013 66% \u2014 say companies are doing a \u201cpoor\u201d job here. The Gallup poll finds remarkable consistency across age groups and among men and women on both questions. Politically, the majority of Democrats (96%), independents (83%) and Republicans (67%) agree that it\u2019s important to avoid major pay gaps. The findings show how the issue of CEO pay strikes a chord among many Americans, some of whom are struggling to make ends meet in an increasingly expensive world. \u201cCEO pay is an outrage. It\u2019s atrocious. And it hugely undermines confidence in our institutions,\u201d said Nell Minow, vice chair of ValueEdge Advisors, which advises institutional investors on corporate governance issues. The poll comes as Tesla shareholders vote on whether to award CEO Elon Musk a massive pay package valued at more than $40 billion.\u00a0Tesla plans to announce results of the shareholder vote \u2014 which is nonbinding \u2014 at Thursday\u2019s annual meeting. 196 years to earn what a CEO makes The issue is not just that CEOs make a lot of money. It\u2019s that they make so much more than employees. It would take the typical employee 196 years to make as much as their CEO made last year alone, according to an analysis by Equilar and The Associated Press. \u201cInstinctively, it doesn\u2019t seem fair. How can a CEO make 196 times the average worker?\u201d said Cynthia Clark, a professor of management at Bentley University. \u201cEither the CEO is overpaid, the average worker is underpaid \u2013 or both.\u201d And yet the gap between CEOs and workers is widening. In 2022, CEOs made 185 times the median employee, according to the Equilar study. CEO pay, including stock awards, soared by 12.6% last year. The Equilar study indicates that the median S&P 500 employee received an annual pay increase of about $4,300 last year. For CEOs, the annual pay hike amounted to $1.5 million. Taxing excessive CEO pay? The Gallup survey found little difference between generations on the CEO pay issue. For instance, 70% of those aged 18 to 29 say companies are doing a poor job in avoiding a major pay gap between CEOs and average employees. That is similar to the 63% who said the same among those 60 years old and above. Likewise, 67% of men say companies are doing a poor job here, compared with 65% of women. Democrats were much more likely than Republicans to be critical of CEO pay practices, however. The poll found that 81% of Democrats say companies are doing a poor job on avoiding a major pay gap, compared with 47% of Republicans. Nearly two-thirds (64%) of independents say companies are doing a poor job here. In January, progressive lawmakers led by Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren introduced the Tax Excessive CEO Pay Act, which would raise taxes on companies that pay their top executives at least 50 times more than the pay of a typical worker. Of course, corporate boards are in a war for talent. They are competing against each other to hire the CEOs that will position the company for success. If their rivals are paying fat pay packages, they can\u2019t just ignore that. \u2018Very troubling\u2019 Still, even some former CEOs are startled. \u201cIt\u2019s gotten completely out of hand,\u201d Bill George, the former CEO of medical device maker Medtronic told CNN. \u201cWhat worries me is there is no ceiling on the amounts people are getting. That\u2019s very troubling to me.\u201d Broadcom CEO Hock Tan led the way among S&P 500 CEOs last year, raking in $161.8 million. FICO CEO William Lansing was the next-closest CEO, hauling in $66.3 million in total compensation. George, currently an executive fellow at the Harvard Business School, was stunned by that figure. \u201c$66 million for a company that doesn\u2019t even have $1 billion in sales? How do you justify this?\u201d he said. A FICO spokesperson defended Lansing\u2019s pay package, noting that total shareholder returns under his leadership over the past 10 years is better than 99% of S&P 500 companies. The company also pointed out Lansing\u2019s base salary last year was only $750,000. \u201cFICO structures its executive compensation to be consistent with industry best practices, including prioritizing long-term incentive pay that is based on the company\u2019s performance and aligned with shareholder value creation,\u201d the spokesperson said. CNN has reached out to Broadcom for comment. Boeing raised eyebrows in April by revealing that CEO Dave Calhoun was awarded $32.8 million in total compensation in 2023. That amounted to a 45% spike in pay despite the chronic losses and safety troubles at the troubled aircraft maker. George said that when he was CEO of Medtronic from 1991 to 2001, he worried making too much money would cause a \u201closs of trust\u201d internally. \u201cToday, it\u2019s causing a real loss of trust among working-class people towards corporate leaders and anger towards big business. There is a backlash,\u201d he said. Pressure on boards Starting in 2017, public companies were required to disclose the ratio between CEO pay and that of the median employee. Some experts hoped that requirement, part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank law passed by Congress after the Great Recession, would help narrow the CEO pay gap by bringing transparency to the issue. \u201cIronically, it has not reduced pay,\u201d said Clark, the Bentley professor. If anything, Clark said the data has only fueled pay by arming CEOs with data about what their competitors are making. George agreed, saying: \u201cI think people like being on these lists of highest-paid CEOs. It becomes almost an entitlement.\u201d Minow, the ValueEdge vice chair, argued there is \u201cplenty of blame to go around\u201d when it comes to CEO pay, including on shareholders for being \u201ctoo lenient\u201d and on the media for failing to hold directors accountable for outrageous pay packages. Yet Minow said most of the blame lies with the boards of directors who approve pay packages in the first place. \u201cThere is no possible way to justify CEO pay,\u201d she said. \u201cIt makes people feel that there is a massive injustice in the world and gives them a cynicism that is not healthy.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/business/ceo-pay-poll-gallup/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_business_taylor-swift-liverpool-eras-tour-beatles-anfield", "text": "In a pub just a stone\u2019s throw from Anfield stadium, where 60,000 fans gather regularly to watch Liverpool Football Club, bar staff are preparing to serve a very different clientele. The Sandon has been catering to the soccer crowd for more than a century. On Thursday, it expects to welcome Taylor Swift fans heading to Anfield for the first of the superstar\u2019s three \u201cEras Tour\u201d concerts in Liverpool. Ceri Smith, floor manager at The Sandon, says concerts like Swift\u2019s infuse the 154-year-old pub with a \u201ccompletely different\u201d atmosphere. \u201cIt\u2019s mainly girls wanting to dress up and (bachelorette) parties wanting to go to the concerts,\u201d she told CNN, adding that the pub had hired a Swift look-alike to sing karaoke, and set up a glitter face-paint stall for customers. Smith expects the concerts will give a \u201cmassive\u201d boost to the pub\u2019s finances, as well as the legion of bakeries, fish-and-chip shops and hair salons in the Anfield neighborhood, about 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) north of the center of the city. Local officials expect the concerts will boost the economy of Liverpool \u2014 one of the most deprived cities in the United Kingdom \u2014 just as the Eurovision Song Contest did last year. That week of concerts, club nights and other Eurovision-themed events generated nearly \u00a355 million ($70 million) in additional spending in the northern English city, according to a report by Amion Consulting commissioned by Liverpool City Council. The so-called visitor economy, which includes bars, restaurants, hotels and tourist attractions among other venues, provides a sizable share of the council\u2019s income. Almost 50% of the business rates \u2014\u00a0taxes on commercial properties \u2014\u00a0collected by the local government come from such businesses, according to Harry Doyle, a senior council official responsible for health, wellbeing and culture. \u201cThe fact that Taylor is coming to Liverpool\u2026 it\u2019s a huge coup for us,\u201d he told CNN. Liverpool ONE, a complex of more than 170 stores, bars, restaurants and hotels in the city center, forecasts that Swift\u2019s three shows will attract 100,000 additional visitors to the area, generating an extra \u00a312 million ($15.4 million) in spending. The \u2018Swift lift\u2019 It wouldn\u2019t be the first time Swift sprinkles some of her economic fairy dust over the cities she visits on her mammoth tour, which kicked off in March last year in the United States. Average sales in restaurants within a 2.5-mile radius (1.6 kilometers) of Swift\u2019s concert venues in the US soared by more than 68% over the days of her performances, according to the Mastercard Economics Institute. Fans also boosted average spending on accommodation by 32% within a 10-mile radius (16 kilometers) of the concerts. Natalia Lechmanova, chief European economist at the institute, said Liverpool would likely feel the \u201cSwift lift\u201d more strongly than London, where the singer is scheduled to perform for eight nights over June and August. \u201cWe have found in the US that smaller cities have experienced a bigger (economic) impact than larger cities,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cFilling up a 60-80,000-person stadium in a city like Liverpool is a big deal: It is the event taking place that day, while in London, even if Wembley (stadium) is full, there\u2019s still a bunch of other cultural events going on.\u201d Taylor-mania Liverpool City Council has pulled out all the stops to welcome Swift, partnering with local artists to create a \u201cTaylor Town Trail\u201d \u2014\u00a011 art installations dotted around the city representing the singer\u2019s distinct albums, or musical eras, including a moss-covered grand piano for the \u201cEvermore\u201d album and giant hearts for the \u201cLover\u201d era. The University of Liverpool is also hosting a conference,\u00a0dubbed \u201cTay Day,\u201d on Wednesday to \u201cdebate, discuss, and deconstruct Taylor Swift\u2019s musical, social, and economic impact,\u201c according to its website. The event will end with a \u201ccritical karaoke\u201d session, in which researchers will perform Swift-related essays to one of her tracks. This excitement around Swift\u2019s visit is reminiscent of another mania that swept Liverpool six decades ago at the height of The Beatles\u2019 popularity. The legendary band of four Liverpudlians played their first concert at the city\u2019s Cavern Club in 1961. The frenzy that ensued and became known as \u201cBeatlemania\u201d reached its zenith in 1966, according to National Museums Liverpool, when fans\u2019 screams often drowned out the music at the band\u2019s gigs. \u201c(Swift\u2019s) got a huge following, just as The Beatles did,\u201d said Doyle at Liverpool City Council. \u201cYou can\u2019t quite greet artists off a plane at an airport anymore like you used to back when The Beatles were huge, but I\u2019m sure if you could Taylor would have that same reception.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s probably the biggest pop star on the planet right now,\u201d he added. In 2015, UNESCO designated Liverpool a City of Music because of its rich musical heritage. Besides The Beatles, the city has spawned bands such as Frankie Goes To Hollywood and Atomic Kitten. Kevin McManus at Liverpool City Council, who works on supporting the city\u2019s music sector, hopes Swift\u2019s concerts will raise the profile of Liverpool\u2019s small, grassroots music venues \u2014 the \u201clifeblood\u201d of its music sector. In recent years, music venues in Liverpool, like in the rest of the country, have faced the \u201cdouble whammy\u201d of the coronavirus pandemic and a cost-of-living crisis that has forced many people to spend less on entertainment, he told CNN. \u201cPeople are more choosy about when they go out because they\u2019ve got less money to spend,\u201d McManus said. \u201cBut we need to protect (grassroots venues) or we don\u2019t get the next generation of superstars.

{"id": "2024_06_07_business_depression-era-law-ftc-southern-glazers", "text": "Federal regulators are planning to use a\u00a0rarely enforced\u00a0law from the Great Depression to allege America\u2019s largest alcohol distributor is unfairly pricing wine and spirits, a person familiar with the matter told CNN. A looming\u00a0Federal Trade Commission\u00a0lawsuit against Southern Glazer\u2019s Wine and Spirits would be aimed at lowering costs for consumers \u2014 in this case on alcohol \u2014 and ensuring mom-and-pop shops have a level playing field against big chains, the source said. The case, which could be\u00a0risky, would represent the latest effort by Biden\u00a0administration\u00a0regulators to show they are taking action to lower costs and confront dominant companies. It would also be the latest aggressive step by\u00a0FTC Chair Lina Khan, who recently led the agency to\u00a0ban most employers from using noncompete clauses\u00a0and is probing a\u00a0Microsoft deal with an artificial intelligence startup. The latest battleground in the antitrust fight could be booze. Southern Glazer\u2019s, based in Miami and operating in 44 US states, is the largest wine and spirits distributor in the United States. The family-owned company distributes everything from Grey Goose vodka and Jim Beam bourbon to Yellow Tail wine. Abandoned antitrust law from 1936 The FTC lawsuit, previously reported by\u00a0Politico, could come in the next few weeks and would rely on the\u00a0Robinson-Patman Act of 1936, the source said. That Depression-era law prohibits suppliers from providing deeper discounts to large chains than to smaller stores. In other words, discounts to big-box chains must be available to mom-and-pop stores, too. At the time, the antitrust law was aimed at helping smaller grocers survive when A&P\u00a0and\u00a0other chains dominated with lower prices. However, an FTC lawsuit against Southern Glazer\u2019s today would be controversial\u00a0in part because the Robinson-Patman Act has rarely been enforced since the late 1980s. In fact, this would be the first time it\u2019s been invoked since 2000, when the\u00a0agency settled with spice company McCormick. \u201cIt\u2019s been a law since 1936. It\u2019s still a law on the books. We enforce the law,\u201d the source told CNN, adding that since the law hasn\u2019t been enforced some smaller stores have struggled to survive. \u201cIf you can\u2019t compete on price or come even close, you can\u2019t stay in business.\u201d The thinking is that if a major alcohol distributor is offering deeper discounts to, say,\u00a0Walmart or Target, that\u2019s unfair to the smaller stores and their shoppers. And if those stores don\u2019t exist, consumers are harmed from the lack of access and from the fact that the larger chains now face less competition on price. Could enforcement\u00a0backfire on shoppers? Yet critics of the Robinson-Patman Act argue that enforcement would backfire on consumers, causing big chains to raise prices because they lose access to deep discounts they currently enjoy. Favoring small businesses over large ones, critics argue, would\u00a0harm\u00a0consumers. Alden Abbott, a former FTC general counsel during the Trump administration, warned in a Forbes op-ed last month that the FTC should consider the \u201cmajor downside\u201d of Robinson-Patman Act (RPA) prosecutions. \u201cWhile perhaps cloaked in \u2018fairness,\u2019 a major RPA lawsuit could discourage business discounting at a time of public concern over excessively high prices,\u201d wrote Abbott, senior research fellow at George Mason University\u2019s Mercatus Center. The Antitrust Modernization Commission, a bipartisan commission created by Congress, concluded in 2007 that Congress should \u201cfinally repeal\u201d the Robinson-Patman Act because it \u201cappears antithetical to core antitrust principles.\u201d \u201cA successful revival of Robinson-Patman would more likely result in\u00a0higher\u00a0not lower prices,\u201d said Ed Schwartz, an antitrust partner with Reed Smith. However, that is hard to prove. Much of the debate is theoretical since the law hasn\u2019t been enforced in decades. \u201cThere is no empirical evidence that enforcement of the Robinson-Patman Act raises consumer prices,\u201d said Lee Hepner, senior counsel at the American Economic Liberties Project, a nonpartisan anti-monopoly advocacy group. While opponents of enforcing Robinson-Patman say consumers are helped by the big discounts large chains get, Hepner argued the opposite is true. \u201cPrice discrimination is a tool used by dominant corporations to enhance their market power,\u201d he said. \u201cThat market power leads to higher consumer prices.\u201d Chris Jones, chief government relations officer and counsel at the National Grocers Association, a national trade association for independent grocers, said enforcement of the Robinson-Patman Act by the FTC is \u201clong overdue.\u201d \u201cFor decades, antitrust enforcers have overlooked this statute, allowing dominant firms to use their size and market power to crush\u00a0main\u00a0street businesses and increase consumer costs,\u201d said Jones, leader of the Main Street Competition Coalition, an industry group that supports enforcement of the 1936 law. \u201cEnforcing the Robinson-Patman Act will help restore true price competition across the economy, benefiting consumers with more choices and lower prices for everyday essentials.\u201d A key test case in antitrust Both the FTC and Southern Glazer\u2019s declined to comment. However, a person familiar with the matter said Southern Glazer\u2019s discounts are available to all retailers where permitted by state law. The source added that there are no secret discounts going on and that the only reason a smaller store may not enjoy the same discount as a larger store is because they can\u2019t or won\u2019t take on the same volume. The FTC has not filed a lawsuit against Southern Glazer\u2019s,\u00a0and there is no guarantee the agency will pursue one. It\u2019s still possible that FTC commissioners vote against such a lawsuit. But if the lawsuit does go forward, it would represent a test case \u2014 and a complex one at that. One complicating factor is that the alcohol industry is already heavily regulated at the state level. There is a maze of state-level rules that dictate who can sell what booze to whom. That could make such a case a state\u2019s rights issue \u2013 and one where businesses argue consumers will be hurt. Schwartz, the Reed Smith lawyer, said a case against Southern Glazer\u2019s would reflect a shift in enforcement policy at the FTC under Khan away from the consumer welfare standards, where lower prices\u00a0are\u00a0almost always considered better for competition. The goal here would be to \u201ctry to level the playing field for small retailers who are trying to compete,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could think of it as much as a challenge to the mega-retailers as it is to the suppliers.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/business/depression-era-law-ftc-southern-glazers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "business"}}

However, it\u2019s clear that there is something different about Dex; she\u2019s an entirely virtual \u201cdigital human,\u201d designed by a startup in the UK. For her performances, Dex is displayed on a video screen or as a holographic projection, with her mixes created by humans. She is animated using Unreal Engine \u2014 a 3D modeling software widely used in video games \u2014 combined with motion-capture. Generative artificial intelligence allows her to remember information and respond to questions, using a voice also generated by AI. \u201cShe\u2019s probably one of the only digital humans in the performance space that you can have a conversation and interact with,\u201d says Denise Harris, CCO of startup Sum Vivas. \u201cYou can ask her anything. She is a genius about music.\u201d Last month, Dex performed at Digital Fashion Weeks in New York, Paris and Milan, and she has modeled outfits by Prada and Louis Vuitton at digital fashion events. For Liverpool-based Sum Vivas she\u2019s a \u201cshowpiece\u201d for more practical applications. The company is now developing digital humans that can \u201clisten\u201d to people\u2019s questions and converse in real time. \u201cShellie\u201d can provide product information as an avatar on company websites, while \u201cArif\u201d is set to direct passengers and answer questions as a multilingual concierge on screens at airports. According to CEO and founder Rob Sims, digital humans can help bridge the gap between AI technology and people. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve found is when people start working with and conversing with a digital human, they very quickly suspend disbelief,\u201d Sims tells CNN. \u201cIt becomes natural.\u201d AI explosion Since OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT was launched in November 2022, considerable hype has surrounded the potential of generative AI \u2014 artificial intelligence powered by huge datasets of information, capable of generating text outputs in a conversational way. Record levels of investment into generative AI have followed, with over $21 billion poured into the industry during the first nine months of last year, according to data insights company Pitchbook. In March 2023, Google launched Bard (recently renamed Gemini) and around the same time Anthropic released its AI assistant Claude. As generative AI chatbots become increasingly ubiquitous, Sum Vivas is one of several companies looking to make them more human. US and New Zealand-based UneeQ has developed animated conversational \u201cdigital humans\u201d that can be used as virtual sales reps and customer service agents on company websites, and this month it debuted Sama 2.0, an animated cabin crew member that answers questions on Qatar Airways\u2019 website and app. Microsoft recently announced that users of its Azure software would be able to create lifelike avatars capable of turning text prompts into animated speech.

{"id": "2024_03_15_success_best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund", "text": "The average federal tax refund is more than $3,000, according to the latest data from the IRS. Since the majority of tax filers get a refund, there\u2019s a fair chance you could get hundreds if not thousands of dollars back in overpaid taxes, especially if you\u2019re also owed a refund from your state government. That money may feel like a windfall, and it\u2019s easy to squander it on a lot of little things. But if you\u2019re looking to improve your current financial situation, here are seven ideas to consider. Well, technically six, but you\u2019ll enjoy the seventh the most. 1. Pay off high-rate debt If you are carrying a balance on your credit card and are paying 20% to 30% in interest, make this your first priority to pay down. At such sky-high rates, \u201cthe debt can grow faster than you can pay it off,\u201d said Eric Bronnenkant, a certified financial planner and head of tax at Betterment, a robo-advisory financial services firm that also has a human advice team on hand to help clients. Keyana Russ, a certified financial planner at Four Ponds Financial Planning, concurred that people\u2019s awareness of how much money they\u2019re paying in interest over time doesn\u2019t always register. \u201cWhat I usually see is people paying the minimum, or they\u2019re charging everyday expenses and not paying off the bill at the end of the month. \u2026 They don\u2019t understand how much interest they\u2019re paying,\u201d Russ said. For example, if you\u2019re carrying a $3,000 balance at 27% interest and you only pay a required minimum of $97.50 every month, it will take you 240 months (which is 20 years) just to pay off the $3,000 \u2014 and, in addition, you will have paid $3,044.57 in interest, for a total of $6,044.57, according to Bankrate.com\u2019s calculator. 2. Create or add to an emergency fund You can use your refund to start or bolster an emergency fund. When it comes to costly emergencies, there are many Americans who don\u2019t have at least three months\u2019 worth of living expenses set aside, let alone enough to easily handle an unexpected bill of $1,000. Be sure to stash the money in a high-yield savings account at an FDIC-insured bank, Russ suggested, noting that the best interest rates are typically offered by online banks. If you have high-rate debt and you\u2019re lacking emergency savings, Russ suggested you might use a portion of your refund to attack your debt and the other portion to create an emergency fund. Bronnenkant favors paying off the high-rate debt first, but, if you\u2019re low on emergency savings and need a critical repair to help keep your job \u2014 such as on your car \u2014 he said it might make sense to set aside money for that repair and put the rest toward your credit card or other high-rate debt. 3. Make an extra payment on your mortgage If you\u2019re carrying a mortgage at a high rate (e.g., 7% to 8%), and you\u2019re not saddled with credit card debt, you might consider making an extra payment or two. \u201cIt can make a difference in the long run towards your principal,\u201d Russ said.\u00a0 You can even view it as an additional form of savings, in the sense that you\u2019re saving yourself an extra 7% \ufeffor so in interest on the portion of the principal you\u2019re paying down, Bronnenkant noted. 4. Invest in a Roth IRA If your income qualifies you to contribute to a Roth IRA, you can contribute up to $7,000 this year ($8,000 if you\u2019re at least 50) with after-tax savings. That money will grow untaxed until retirement, at which point your withdrawals will be tax-free and penalty-free after age 59-1/2, assuming the account has been open for at least five years. (And note: You can still make a 2023 Roth contribution until April 15 this year. The contribution limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if you\u2019re age 50 or older. Bolstering your tax-free retirement savings is great.\u00a0But if you need to access some of your money well before you retire, you may take out any part of your contributions tax-free and penalty-free at any time, \ufeffBronnenkant said. You would only be taxed and penalized if you withdrew the earnings on your contributions before age 59-1/2. (For more information on Roth IRA withdrawal rules, here is an easy-to-understand rundown from Charles Schwab.) 5. Contribute enough to your 401(k) in 2024 to get your full employer match Speaking of retirement savings, if you\u2019re not yet contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match from your employer, a refund can make that easier. Say you get $3,000 back. You can put that money in a high-yield savings account to earn interest. Then, on your workplace 401(k) site, change your paycheck contribution levels so that by the end of the year you will have contributed $3,000 more in pre-tax money than you otherwise would have. For instance, say you\u2019re paid every two weeks and you have 20 more paychecks left until the end of the year. You can boost you biweekly contributions by $150 per paycheck ($150 x 20 = $3,000). \u201cYou want to get the max match from your employer,\u201d Bronnenkant said. 6. Invest for shorter-term goals If in the next three to 10 years you expect to buy a home, take a once-in-a-lifetime trip, renovate a room, send your kids to summer camp or have any other expensive goal, you might consider investing your refund in a diversified mix of low-cost, broad market index funds. The shorter term your goal is, the less risk you want to take. If you need the money within three years, you might consider putting your refund in certificates of deposits and US Treasury bonds. But if your goal is five to 10 years out, and you\u2019re comfortable taking on some more risk and are willing to accept fluctuations in the market, Bronnenkant said, you might put no more than 30% of your refund in a stock index fund and 70% in a total market bond fund if your risk tolerance is conservative; or 50% in each if you have a moderate risk tolerance. If you plan on sending your child to college and you have a 529 plan, you can use your refund to boost your contributions to that plan, Russ said. You may also get a tax break for your contribution depending on the state where you live. 7. Have some fun Unless you\u2019re in truly dire financial straits, if you get a large refund, you might set aside a small portion to do whatever you truly enjoy. \u201cSometimes you just want to have fun and not have it be all business,\u201d Russ said. \u201cYou can set aside some of the money to have fun.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/15/success/best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_business_menu-prices-rising", "text": "Grocery prices stayed flat in May, after ticking down the month before. But menu prices, a source of frustration for budget-conscious consumers, are still going up \u2014 even as restaurants brag about their discounted meals. Menu prices rose 0.4% at sit-down restaurants from April to May, adjusted for seasonal swings, according to inflation data released Wednesday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In that time prices ticked up 0.2% at limited service spots, which include fast casual and fast food joints. The difference between grocery increases and menu price inflation was more pronounced for the full year. Grocery prices rose 1% in the 12 months through May. In that period, menu prices at full-service, or sit-down, restaurants rose 3.5%. They jumped 4.5% at limited-service restaurants, which include fast food and fast casual joints. The increases, particularly in fast food prices, have caused customers to pull back on spending and complain online, eroding the sector\u2019s reputation for affordability. Restaurant chains raise menu prices every year, but since the pandemic hikes have been coming in fast and furious. Executives noted that for a while, the higher prices didn\u2019t scare people off. But customers finally snapped, leaving chains to reverse course and sometimes get defensive. McDonald\u2019s USA president Joe Erlinger recently said in an open letter that prices have risen about 21% over five years. That\u2019s a bit less than inflation overall \u2014 not 100% as, he said, people may think, thanks to an analysis from FinanceBuzz. It recently found that McDonald\u2019s prices have risen 100% since 2014. Still, he acknowledged that at some locations, Big Mac meals may be going for much higher. On TikTok, complaints of $3 McDonald\u2019s hash browns and $16 meals have gone viral. Chains from Burger King to KFC to Starbucks have also started touting menu bundles and deals in a bid to lure customers back. The deals, however, are temporary, designed to jumpstart sales in a competitive environment. They don\u2019t change restaurant chain operators\u2019 plans to keep raising prices. What\u2019s going on in the grocery store Grocery prices, on the other hand, have moderated, a welcome reversal from months of increases that started with the pandemic, and were exacerbated by the war in Ukraine, extreme weather\u00a0and companies taking the opportunity to pad prices, among other factors. In February,\u00a0overall food prices remained flat\u00a0for the first time since April 2023. Some items have even gotten cheaper over the course of the year. Apple prices plunged 13.2%, thanks largely to an abundant crop in the fall. Also in the produce aisle, potatoes declined 3.2%. Ham slumped 5.4% and cheese dropped 3.4% (bread rose 1%, so your sandwich isn\u2019t a total bargain). Coffee dropped 2.5% and milk fell 2.1%. Rice decreased 2%, and fish and seafood together dropped 1%. Other items got more expensive this year, particularly in the meat aisle, due in part to a\u00a0constrained supply of cattle\u00a0and\u00a0deadly wildfires in Texas. Uncooked beef roasts rose 6% and uncooked ground beef jumped 4.9%. Hot dogs spiked 7.3% and bacon went up 6.9%. Poultry rose 1.2%. Eggs, which last year notched huge increases, went up by 3%. While grocery prices increased overall for the year, they stayed flat from April to May. In that time, bacon jumped 1.7%, bread went up 1.1%, and uncooked ground beef and chicken each rose 1%. Other prices slumped: Milk dropped 1.3% and rice fell 1.2%.

{"id": "2024_03_19_success_wall-street-bonuses", "text": "Last year wasn\u2019t the most lucrative for Wall Street bankers, but their bonus payouts still easily trounced US median household income. The average Wall Street bonus for 2023 was $176,500, according to estimates that will be released Tuesday morning by New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli. That\u2019s down 2% from the $180,000 recorded in 2022. Both those averages were well below the $240,000 paid out in 2021. That the average bonus was slightly down isn\u2019t surprising. Wall Street earnings last year were mixed, and merger and acquisition activity was underwhelming. \u201cWall Street\u2019s profits were up 1.8% in 2023, but firms have taken a more cautious approach to compensation and more employees have joined the securities industry, which accounts for the slight decline in the average bonus,\u201d DiNapoli said in a statement. Nevertheless, a little perspective: The average Wall Street bonus, which comes on top of the nearly half-a-million-dollar average Wall Street salary, was itself almost 2.5 times higher than the median US household income of $74,580, according to Census data for 2022. Wall Street bonuses and general employment in the securities industry provide vital revenue streams for the New York State and New York City economies, accounting most recently for 27% of the state\u2019s tax collections and 7% of city tax revenue, according to DiNapoli\u2019s office. The securities industry \ufeffin the city employed roughly 198,500 people last year, up from 191,600 the year before. And DiNapoli estimates that 1 in 11 of the city\u2019s jobs are either directly or indirectly associated with the industry. The total estimated bonus pool for 2023 was\u00a0slightly lower than the year before and is\u00a0projected to bring in $4 million less in state income tax revenue and $2 million less for the city revenue than bonuses in 2022 did. Still, DiNapoli noted, \u201cWhile these bonuses affect income tax revenues for the state and city, both budgeted for larger declines so the impact on projected revenues should be limited.\u201d It should be noted that the comptroller\u2019s numbers only reflect the bonuses paid to securities industry employees working for firms based in New York City. Beyond bringing in tax revenue for government coffers, Wall Street workers contribute substantially to the local Gotham economy. DiNapoli said that more employees in financial services (65%) are working in-office on any given day compared to 58% working in other industries in the city, at least as of September 2023. And that securities industry employees use the subway more than other workers in the city. All in, he estimates that Wall Street is responsible for roughly 14% of economic activity in the city. As critical as that is, the city and state are about much more than just Wall Street. \u201cThe securities industry\u2019s continued strength should not overshadow the broader economic picture in New York, where we need all sectors to enjoy full recovery from the pandemic,\u201d DiNapoli said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/19/success/wall-street-bonuses/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_business_homeownership-costs-inflation", "text": "The price for owning a home is rising rapidly \u2013 and we\u2019re not just talking about mortgage payments. US homeowners are now paying an average of $18,118 a year on property taxes, homeowners\u2019 insurance, maintenance, energy and various other expenses linked to owning a home, according to a new Bankrate study. That\u2019s nearly the cost to buy a used car and represents a 26% increase from four years ago when it cost $14,428 annually to own and maintain a home. All of these variable expenses are on top of the fixed cost of a mortgage, including property taxes, homeowners insurance, energy costs, internet, cable bills and home maintenance. The findings are another reminder of how much more expensive life has become since Covid-19. New data released on Wednesday underscored the pressure Americans are feeling from housing-related expenses. Even as items such as food and gas have gotten cheaper, shelter increased 5.4% year-over-year in May, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That\u2019s well above the overall inflation rate of 3.3%. Many Americans would like to buy a home but have been unable to because home prices have spiked to record highs and mortgage rates remain elevated. The housing market is historically unaffordable. But even the ones fortunate enough to have bought a home over the past few years are grappling with sticker shock over the cost of maintaining it. The per-month cost of owning and maintaining a home has gone from $1,202 a month in 2020 to $1,510 now, Bankrate found. Jeff Ostrowski, analyst at Bankrate, told CNN that the main drivers of the spike in homeownership expenses are the cost of maintenance and insurance. Home insurance premiums have surged in recent years, in part because of extreme weather. \u201cMy homeowners insurance doubled, with no notice \u2013 nothing,\u201d said Jennifer Schauer, who bought her home in Novato, California, in 2021. Schauer said some of her neighbors lost their homeowners insurance coverage altogether because of the mounting threat of wildfires in the region. \u201cMy neighbors said I was lucky our insurance just doubled and it wasn\u2019t canceled,\u201d she said. Home insurance rates jumped 11.3% nationally last year alone, according to S&P Global. The US homeowners insurance industry lost $101.3 billion last year as severe storms, hurricanes and wildfire did significant damage. And high inflation made it that much more expensive to rebuild properties. Schauer, who has two children and works in a high school as a paraeducator, also recently found out her home needs $10,000 worth of plumbing repairs. \u201cThe housing market was so competitive when we bought, that to get this house we waived the homeowner inspection. We bought it as is,\u201d she said. \u201cWe knew the plumbing was old but it\u2019s falling apart.\u201d To make ends meet and deal with the unexpected costs of homeownership, Schauer is taking on extra hours at school as a substitute teacher, accepting help from family to pay for her son to get tutored and cutting costs by avoiding eating out and canceling her home cleaning service. Schauer isn\u2019t alone among Californians grappling with high hidden costs of homeownership. The average cost of owning and maintaining a home in California is $28,790, according to Bankrate, second among all US states behind only Hawaii. The top five is rounded out by Massachusetts ($26,313), New Jersey ($25,573) and Connecticut ($23,515). By contrast, Kentucky ($11,559), Arkansas ($11,692) and Mississippi ($11,881) had the lowest hidden costs of homeownership, according to Bankrate. Since Covid, the hidden cost of homeownership has climbed most rapidly in three states: Utah (44%), Idaho (39%) and Hawaii (38%). Of course, the silver lining for homeowners is the fact that home values have gone up significantly since 2020. Those gains have padded the net worth of millions of Americans. Median inflation-adjusted net worth swelled by 37% between 2019 to 2022, according to the Federal Reserve. The real estate boom also gives homeowners additional financial flexibility, letting them borrow against the value of their homes to pay for unexpected costs, finance the cost of education or upgrade their homes. Still, Ostrowski, the Bankrate analyst, said the findings should be a \u201creality check\u201d for first-time homebuyers. \u201cA lot of first-time buyers think of the closing table as the finish line,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in another way, it\u2019s just the starting line for all these new expenses you\u2019ll be responsible for.\u201d Ostrowski said buyers must budget for these hidden costs of homeownership when they are trying to determine how much they can afford to spend on a mortgage. \u201cYou may have thought you were done scrimping and saving when you got enough for a down payment,\u201d he said. \u201cBut once you own, you have to set aside money for these unexpected costs.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/business/homeownership-costs-inflation/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_economy_june-fed-decision", "text": "The\u00a0Federal Reserve\u00a0said Wednesday it is keeping its benchmark lending rate at its current level for the seventh time in a row, while signaling fewer rate cuts than previously estimated. That means borrowing costs on everything from car loans to mortgage rates will remain elevated. Officials penciled in just one rate cut this year, according to their latest economic projections, compared to the three they forecast in March. They also expect\u00a0inflation\u00a0to be more stubborn this year than they thought in the spring, according to their forecasts. Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that the May Consumer Price Index, released earlier Wednesday, was \u201ccertainly a better inflation report than almost anybody expected.\u201d But he said officials still want to see inflation slow further before lowering borrowing costs. The\u00a0Fed\u00a0has kept interest\u00a0rates\u00a0at a 23-year high for nearly a year, after kicking off an aggressive rate-hiking campaign in March 2022. Central bankers are waiting for more evidence that\u00a0inflation\u00a0is headed toward 2%\u00a0\u2014 and the\u00a0economy\u2019s resilience is allowing them to be comfortably on hold. The\u00a0Fed\u00a0will begin cutting interest\u00a0rates\u00a0once it\u2019s clear that\u00a0inflation\u00a0has cooled enough and won\u2019t heat back up \u2014 or if the job market deteriorates much more than expected, but there are currently not many signs of that. The inflation situation is now better than it was in the first quarter: Consumer prices eased in May, the Labor Department reported Wednesday morning. From a year earlier, inflation rose 3.3% in May, down from April\u2019s 3.4% rise and also below economists\u2019 expectations. Fed\u00a0officials\u2019 latest policy statement noted that\u00a0inflation\u00a0has seen some \u201cmodest further progress\u201d toward their 2% target in recent months, versus the May statement that noted there had been a \u201clack\u201d of any improvements. Here are key takeaways from the Fed\u2019s latest decision on interest rates. Powell calls May inflation data \u2018encouraging\u2019 Not only was the Fed chief pleased with Wednesday\u2019s inflation report, saying it was a \u201cgood reading,\u201d but he maintained his view that interest rates are \u201crestrictive\u201d enough to rein in price hikes. Powell pointed to the substantial progress seen in the second half of last year as an example. Still, he said officials now think \u201cit\u2019s probably going to take longer to get the confidence needed to loosen policy,\u201d compared to what they thought in March. That\u2019s precisely what officials\u2019 forecasts showed. When asked what will help tug inflation closer to the Fed\u2019s 2% target, Powell said slower inflation will come \u201cfrom where it\u2019s been coming from,\u201d pointing to the \u201cthe unwinding of the pandemic-related distortions to both supply and demand.\u201d \u201cAnd that is complemented by, amplified by, supported by restrictive monetary policy, so those two things are working together,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve made pretty good progress on inflation with our current [policy] stance.\u201d Economists have said that it\u2019s only a matter of time until declining rents show up in official inflation gauges. Still-high housing costs are still looming large in the CPI: Shelter inflation more than offset the decline in gasoline seen last month, rising 0.4% for the fourth month in a row, the May CPI showed. No concerns about the job market Powell has frequently said the job market likely needs to come back \u201cinto better balance\u201d to ensure that inflation is on track to 2%. That\u2019s because a labor market that\u2019s running too hot could put some upward pressure on prices, making the Fed\u2019s job of fully defeating inflation more difficult. The Fed chief says so far so good. \u201cOverall, a broad set of indicators suggest that conditions in the labor market have returned to about where they stood on the eve of the pandemic, relatively tight but not overheated,\u201d Powell said in his post-meeting press conference on Wednesday afternoon. He pointed to data proving just that: Job gains averaging\u00a0218,000 a month in April and May; unemployment still at low levels, job creation driven by more prime-aged workers and immigrants trickling into the workforce; slower wage growth; and a narrower jobs-to-workers ratio. The Fed focuses on the job market not just because of its implications on inflation, but also because the central bank is explicitly tasked by Congress to strive toward maximum employment. If the labor market unexpectedly weakens, then that could force the Fed to consider cutting rates, but Powell didn\u2019t sound concerned at all. \u201cWe see gradual cooling, gradual moving toward a better balance,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re monitoring it carefully for signs of something more than that, but we really don\u2019t see that.\u201d First rate cut in September? Wall Street\u2019s best bet for the first rate cut is currently September, according to futures, and those odds improved markedly after the release of the May CPI. For that to happen, however,\u00a0inflation\u00a0will have to continue to drift lower in the coming months. Officials frequently emphasize that they are \u201cdata dependent\u201d and make conclusions about the\u00a0economy\u00a0after data stretching over several months reveal a trend. It\u2019s unclear if the factors that resulted in hotter-than-expected\u00a0inflation\u00a0readings earlier this year are still lurking in the background, but the May CPI provided some relief. \u201cThe belief that components boosting\u00a0inflation\u00a0in the first quarter were not indicative of current cost pressures needed to be validated. May\u2019s report provides strong evidence on that front,\u201d Matt Colyar, an economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, said in a note Wednesday. \u201cThe\u00a0Fed\u00a0is banking it can wait a few more months until\u00a0inflation\u00a0falls further.\u201d The US\u00a0economy\u00a0remains on strong footing for now, including the job market as employers continue to hire at a brisk pace. But it\u2019s unmistakable that some US consumers are under pressure. Still-high\u00a0inflation\u00a0is continuing to eat into some budgets, pandemic savings are drying up, borrowers continue to pile on more debt and the highest interest\u00a0rates\u00a0in nearly a quarter century are squeezing Americans.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/economy/june-fed-decision/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_08_business_renting-electric-vehicle-rental-cars", "text": "Lydia Wu had never driven an electric vehicle before she rented a car from Avis last February. An electric Genesis GV60 was all they had available at a location in Kansas City, Kansas. Wu received no specific instructions on how to use the vehicle, or how to find chargers, but she appreciated the SUV\u2019s ornate and elegant interior. \u201cIf it was a gas vehicle, I would totally consider it as my next car,\u201d she said. But she is out of the market for an EV. I, on the other hand, have had a lot of experience with EVs. So when I recently rented a Polestar 2 from Hertz in San Diego and received no instructions it was no problem. But I could imagine a first-time EV driver wondering, \u201cHow do I turn this thing on?\u201d Many would be flummoxed by a car with no \u201cStart\u201d button, for instance. In a Polestar, you get in and it\u2019s on. You get out and it turns off. A lot of drivers may be baffled by that alone. While sales growth has slowed, EVs make up about 7% of overall car sales, according to Cox Automotive. Rental car companies may have overestimated their customers\u2019 readiness for a switch, though. Hertz made a bold move in 2021, saying it would order 65,000 EVs from Polestar, 100,000 from Tesla and another 175,000 from General Motors. At the time, Hertz said that EVs might represent 25% of its fleet by 2024. But in January Hertz said it would sell 20,000 Tesla models, or one-third of its fleet, to buy gas-powered cars. The company\u2019s CEO at the time, Stephen Scherr, said, \u201cCollision and damage repairs on an EV can often run about twice that associated with a comparable combustion engine vehicle.\u201d Scant driver\u2019s ed In general, big rental car companies, with huge fleets to manage and lots of customers to put into cars, don\u2019t have time to give individual instruction to rookie EV drivers. And it\u2019s not a seamless transition from a gas-powered vehicle to an EV. Experienced as I am, I was still taken by surprise as I approached a stop light in the Polestar and the car slowed abruptly as soon as I lifted off the accelerator. Oh, right\u2026it\u2019s called \u201cautomatic regenerative braking.\u201d The Polestar was using its electric motor to slow the car while sending power back to the battery. That\u2019s a good thing, but, again, I could just imagine a new renter panicking and thinking, \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d Hertz said in an email that it provides a QR code that links to a website with information about how to charge and even how to drive individual models like the Polestar 2. If that link was provided during my rental, then I must have missed it. I went to the website and watched the videos and, yes, the instructions would have been helpful. But, let\u2019s face it, how many people who rent cars take the time to read the paperwork, let alone go to a website to review instructions? Beyond that, both Hertz and Avis declined to comment for this story. Doug Jensen, similarly to Wu, found due to scarcity that he had to rent an EV from a Hertz location in New York City. Given no instruction on how to handle charging, he found himself trying to use Tesla chargers for his Kia rental car, not initially realizing they wouldn\u2019t work. Then he had to struggle with a non-working EV charger at his hotel. Since then, Hertz has respected Jensen\u2019s request to never have an EV again, he said. Hertz also gave him a free rental day and extra loyalty points to make up for his aggravation. Charging as a sticky point It was around around 1 a.m. in February in Kansas City, Kansas, when Wu got her rental GV60 with its batteries charged up to 57%. She had to quickly find a charger since it was cold and, with the heat running, the battery was draining faster than normal. \u201cIt was easy to find chargers but the thing is (the navigation software was) pulling up every single charger available including Tesla Superchargers,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t have EV experience so I had no idea if Tesla Superchargers were going to work with my car.\u201d Wu was ultimately able to find a charger. She said her experience with the EV was good after it had been plugged in. \u201cI could monitor how my car was doing, charge-wise, from my phone, even though it was in the parking lot a few blocks away. So everything was super great,\u201d she said. There are car rental companies that offer customers more hand-holding. In my case, I\u2019ve rented EVs from Turo, a peer-to-peer car rental platform that\u2019s sort of like Airbnb but for cars. Just like with Airbnb, some people have set up small businesses renting their vehicles through Turo and some of them specialize in EVs. When I\u2019ve rented EVs through Turo, a host has always given me a helpful walk-through of the vehicle. The hosts would explain the features, something that was especially helpful when I rented a Tesla Cybertruck, an EV that has plenty of quirks. The Cybertruck had cost more than a $1,000 a day to rent at the time including insurance \u2014 it had just come out \u2014 but EV rental costs are normally more in line with gas cars. Customer service as key Joulez, an EV rental company, rents its fleet through its own website as well as through Turo. Founder Micah Bergdale said he had rented EVs years ago and saw an opportunity to do it better so he started the company in 2021. \u201cThe entire experience that someone has, especially if they\u2019re not familiar with it, is very different than a traditional gas car,\u201d he said. On the Joulez website, customers are asked if they have ever driven an EV and if they have any experience with the specific model they\u2019re about to rent. If not, an on-site attendant can provide an overview. Also, Joulez has a customer service line if they have issues with things like charging. Of course, a company like Joulez can provide that kind of attention because it only has locations in four US cities and its fleet consists of about 150 vehicles. Bigger rental companies, on the other hand, manage hundreds of thousands of cars in locations nationwide. And, of course, Joulez and Turo have the advantage of a customer base that knows up front what they\u2019re renting. Their customers select specific vehicles, unlike customers who rent from big rental companies where they might select a general class of vehicle but not find out the make and model until they arrive at the lot. But not everyone has such a bad time when renting an EV from a big rental car company. Jay Waldron, a Georgia resident, rented a Hyundai Kona EV from National while on a trip to Washington, DC. He loved how fun it was to drive. \u201cIt was so disappointing going back to my old stick-shift 4 cylinder,\u201d he said in a text message. \u201cSitting in traffic with it, I missed that EV bad.\u201d A few weeks later, Waldron bought himself a Kia EV6.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/08/business/renting-electric-vehicle-rental-cars/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_business_amazon-contract-workers-file-legal-claims", "text": "More than 15,000 Amazon contract drivers filed arbitration claims against the e-commerce giant on Tuesday, alleging Amazon classified them as independent contractors instead of employees with minimum wage and overtime rights. Millions of Americans participate in the \u201cgig economy,\u201d freelancing work through delivery and ride apps like Lyft, Uber, Doordash and Instacart. But as gig work has gotten more popular, many of those workers say they are in fact employees, not just contractors, and therefore deserve more benefits and protections. The definition and rights of a contract worker versus an employee, for example, has been fiercely debated in laws such as California\u2019s Prop 22, which allows ride-hailing and delivery drivers to be treated as independent contractors with some added benefits, including a minimum earnings guarantee. Amazon Flex, launched in 2015, allows independent contractors to sign up to deliver Amazon packages. Flex drivers provide Amazon Fresh grocery deliveries or same-day deliveries from the company\u2019s warehouse hubs. Since the drivers are classified as independent contractors, these claims ask for compensation for unpaid wages and overtime, and reimbursement for expenses such as mileage and cell phone usage. Lawyers for the case said in a statement that about 450 such claims had been previously filed with the American Arbitration Association. Drivers from California, Massachusetts and Illinois filed claims because laws about employee misclassification are \u201cvery clear\u201d in those states, attorney Steven Tindall told CNN. The three states also allow workers to file claims for expense reimbursement from employers, Tindall added. Tindall and another attorney, Joseph Sellers, have been collecting claims for years, Tindall said. In a statement, Amazon said Flex \u201cgives individuals the opportunity to set their own schedule and be their own boss, while earning competitive pay. We hear from most of the Amazon Flex delivery partners that they love the flexibility of the program, and we\u2019re proud of the work they do on behalf of customers every day.\u201d\u00a0On its website, Amazon says most drivers earn between $18 to $25 an hour. In their statement, Tindall and Sellers said Amazon only pays the drivers for a pre-determined \u201cblock.\u201d If a Flex driver books a three-hour block on the app, they only get paid for three hours, even if deliveries come in that take more time. Amazon told CNN the majority of Amazon Flex delivery partners finish their delivery blocks early, according to its own data. Tindall told CNN that the workers filed independent arbitration claims instead of a class action lawsuit because drivers have to sign an agreement that forbids class action. \u201cArbitration, unfortunately, limits the drivers\u2019 pursuit of justice. So, we\u2019re left with little choice but to file almost 16,000 individual arbitration actions at once,\u201d Tindall said. CNN\u2019s Samantha Delouya contributed to this report.

{"id": "2024_03_26_media_nbc-news-ousts-ronna-mcdaniel", "text": "NBC News on Tuesday ousted former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel, just days after her hiring as a paid political analyst sparked intense backlash from the network\u2019s top television anchors over McDaniel\u2019s role in subverting the 2020 election and attacks on the press. \u201cThere is no doubt that the last several days have been difficult for the News Group,\u201d NBCUniversal News Group President Cesar Conde said in a memo to staff. \u201cAfter listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor.\u201d \u201cI want to personally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down,\u201d Conde continued. \u201cWhile this was a collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team, I approved it and take full responsibility for it.\u201d Ahead of the network\u2019s decision, McDaniel spent the day Tuesday interviewing attorneys in preparation for a potential legal battle with NBC, a person familiar with the matter told CNN. Creative Artists Agency, the talent agency that brokered McDaniel\u2019s deal with NBC, also parted ways with her, the person said. The reversal comes after journalists and anchors at both NBC and its cable news sibling MSNBC publicly denounced the decision to hire McDaniel as a paid analyst in a stunning and unprecedented on-air rebuke of network brass that has embarrassed the Peacock Network. McDaniel, who recently stepped down from the RNC under pressure from former President Donald Trump, was involved in attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. As head of the RNC, she was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d In the years since, McDaniel continued to claim that the election had \u201cproblems\u201d and that Biden did not legitimately win the election, fanning the flames of election denialism. NBC\u2019s announcement Friday that it had hired McDaniel was quickly met with alarm by the network\u2019s journalists. The revolt spilled into public view on Sunday when McDaniel appeared on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with moderator Kristen Welker in her first interview since she was hired by the network. Welker disclosed that the interview had been scheduled to take place prior to NBC announcing McDaniel would become a paid contributor for the network, stating that she had no involvement in her hiring. Following the interview, Chuck Todd, NBC News\u2019 chief political analyst, delivered a stinging on-air criticism of NBC executives for their decision to hire McDaniel, telling Welker, \u201cI think our bosses owe you an apology for putting you in this situation.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a reason a lot of journalists at NBC News are uncomfortable with this,\u201d Todd said, explaining that under McDaniel, the RNC engaged in \u201cgaslighting\u201d and \u201ccharacter assassination\u201d when dealing with the news media. The following day, MSNBC hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough joined Todd in protesting the decision on their program \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d \u201cTo be clear, we believe NBC News should seek out conservative Republican voices to provide balance in their election coverage, but it should be conservative Republicans, not a person who used her position of power to be an anti-democracy election denier,\u201d\u00a0Brzezinski said. \u201cWe hope NBC will reconsider its decision. It goes without saying that she will not be a guest on \u2018Morning Joe\u2019 in her capacity as a paid contributor.\u201d Nicolle Wallace, host of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cDeadline: White House,\u201d later joined in the rebuke, saying on her program that the network\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel was nothing short of a potential threat to democracy. \u201cNBC News is, either wittingly or unwittingly, teaching election deniers that what they can do stretches well beyond appearing on our air and interviews to peddle lies about the sanctity and integrity of our elections,\u201d Wallace told viewers. Rachel Maddow \u2014 the network\u2019s biggest star \u2014 later devoted the first half-hour of her prime-time program to the controversy, saying the decision to hire McDaniel was \u201cinexplicable.\u201d Maddow took issue with McDaniel\u2019s long track record of demonizing the news media, labeling the press as \u201cfake news,\u201d and launching ugly attacks on NBC News journalists and MSNBC hosts. \u201cWe do not take it personally when we get attacked, when they say they want to put us on trial and execute us for treason,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so I want to associate myself with all my colleagues at MSNBC and NBC News who have voiced loud and principled objections to our company for putting on the payroll someone who hasn\u2019t just attacked us as journalists, but someone who is part of an ongoing project to get rid of our system of government,\u201d she said of McDaniel. \u201cSomeone who is still trying to convince Americans that this election stuff doesn\u2019t really work. That this last election wasn\u2019t a real result. That American elections are fraudulent.\u201c The on-air revolt ensnared NBC\u2019s top leaders, including NBCUniversal News Group chair Cesar Conde, NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown, who were responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring. MSNBC president Rashida Jones also did not object to the decision, people familiar with the matter said. In the wake of Conde\u2019s announcement to sever ties with McDaniel, MSNBC host Joy Reid and Maddow addressed the reversal on the network\u2019s air, praising the move as \u201cbold\u201d and \u201cstrong.\u201d \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/media/nbc-news-ousts-ronna-mcdaniel/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "business"}}

Last month, she announced her exit. As part of her separation agreement from former husband Bill, French Gates said she will receive an additional $12.5 billion for her charitable work. She explained that her departure from the foundation stemmed from her reaction to the US Supreme Court\u2019s 2022 Dobbs decision that let individual states decide abortion rights. The philanthropist felt compelled to offer Americans financial support for their reproductive freedoms \u2014 support that she says she had been giving exclusively overseas. \u201cWhile I have long focused on improving contraceptive access overseas, in the post-Dobbs era, I now feel compelled to support reproductive rights here at home,\u201d French Gates said in an op-ed in late May in the\u00a0New York Times.

You can sign up\u00a0right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link. Meme stock mania is back. This time around, it\u2019s looking a little different. Meme stocks saw a resurgence last month after Keith Gill, an investor who helped stoke the meme stock frenzy in 2021, made his first post on X in three years. Also known as \u201cRoaring Kitty,\u201d Gill has since posted screenshots on Reddit that appear to show GameStop shares and call options worth hundreds of millions of dollars in his portfolio, stoking excitement among his devout followers. (CNN has not independently confirmed the screenshots.) GameStop shares have surged roughly 75% and seen wild, unpredictable swings since that first post. Gill\u2019s fans last Friday flocked to his livestream, inundating the live chat with comments and questions. A video montage of kittens played before Gill himself finally appeared.\u00a0The meme trader poured a beer during the stream and sported gaudy white sunglasses. For many traders who experienced the original meme stock craze, the phenomenon has prompted a wave of deja vu. Still, there are key differences between the reignited 2024 meme stock craze and the original in 2021. For one, trading volumes aren\u2019t nearly as high as they were three years ago. Daily trading volumes of GameStop shares peaked at roughly 789 million on January 22, 2021, when the stock popped 51%, according to FactSet data. The highest trading volume for GameStop so far this year was on June 7, when roughly 279 million shares traded hands \u2014 and the stock tumbled 39%. The difference in volumes could be due to the drastic changes in the economy, on Wall Street and in the world during the last few years. In 2021, people were stuck at home due to the Covid pandemic, using their stimulus checks to buy everything from exercise equipment to ingredients for baking bread to stocks. Interest rates were near zero, and the US economy was booming. Now, interest rates are at a 23-year high. Persistent inflation is eating into Americans\u2019 savings accounts. The economy remains resilient, but is showing signs of cooling as the Federal Reserve tries to bring down prices without triggering a recession. That has traders less willing to take on less investment risk compared to three years ago. One thing that\u2019s stayed the same? GameStop, along with other meme stocks, is still lacking when it comes to its balance sheet, says Craig Sarembock, a wealth advisor at Bartlett Wealth Management. While GameStop shares have surged in recent weeks, it is still down 65% from its record high closing price in 2021. The video game retailer reported last Friday a loss of $32.3 million during the first quarter, slightly better than the $50.5 million loss the prior year. Sales slipped to $900 million from $1.2 billion the year before. \u201cCan you trade [meme stocks] and make money? Absolutely. You can do that with any stock. But for long term investors, that is just an area I would avoid wholeheartedly,\u201d said Sarembock. Why oil companies are raking in record profits under Joe Biden Nearly four years ago, while campaigning in the runup to the last presidential election, Donald Trump warned that President Joe Biden would \u201cdestroy\u201d the oil industry. As Trump and Biden are set once again to face off in a presidential election, Trump has renewed claims that Biden\u2019s agenda has hurt energy producers, promising to hit rewind on Biden\u2019s environmental policies. But the oil and gas industry in the United States has thrived under the current president, even as the Biden administration has touted its efforts to transition away from fossil fuels and towards green energy sources, reports my colleague Samantha Delouya. In the last three and a half years, US oil production \u2014 and oil and gas company profits \u2014 have broken records. The top five US-based oil and gas companies by market cap, according to S&P Global \u2014 ExxonMobil, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, EOG Resources and Schlumberger \u2014 have raked in more than $250 billion in profits between 2021 and 2023. That\u2019s a 160% jump compared to the first three years of the pro-big-oil Trump administration, according to calculations by CNN. The energy industry\u2019s recent profit windfall underscores the limited influence of any US president \u2014 whether in favor of fossil fuel or not \u2014 in the global oil and gas market.

In a post to X on Monday, the Tesla chief executive said he would ban Apple devices at his companies \u2014 which include SpaceX and X, among others \u2014 if the iPhone maker went ahead with its AI plans announced Monday. If Apple \u201cintegrates OpenAI at the (operating system) level,\u201d Musk said that would constitute \u201can unacceptable security violation.\u201d He added that visitors \u201cwill have to check their Apple devices at the door, where they will be stored in a Faraday cage,\u201d referring to an enclosure that blocks electromagnetic waves crucial to communications, including cellular, wireless internet and Bluetooth signals. \u201cApple has no clue what\u2019s actually going on once they hand your data over to OpenAI,\u201d Musk said in a separate post. \u201cThey\u2019re selling you down the river.\u201d Musk\u2019s comments came hours after Apple unveiled the partnership with OpenAI at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference, part of a wider push to bring generative artificial intelligence tools to Apple products.

{"id": "2024_06_12_tech_spacex-elon-musk-former-employees-lawsuit", "text": "SpaceX and CEO Elon Musk were sued on Wednesday by former employees who claim they were illegally fired for raising concerns about gender discrimination and sexual harassment at the rocket company. The lawsuit, brought by eight employees who were fired in 2022, alleges that Musk wants to be \u201cthe leader to a brave new world of space travel, but runs his company in the dark ages \u2014 treating women as sexual objects to be evaluated on their bra size, bombarding the workplace with lewd sexual banter, and offering the reprise to those who challenge the \u2018Animal House\u2019 environment that if they don\u2019t like it they can seek employment elsewhere,\u201d according to the complaint, filed in state court in California. The eight former employees were involved in writing a 2022 open letter criticizing Musk and urging SpaceX executives to make the firm\u2019s culture more inclusive. The letter, which was signed by at least 400 other employees, asked SpaceX management to make it clear that Musk\u2019s statements \u2014 particularly on Twitter \u2014 did not reflect the views or values of the company and asserted that SpaceX\u2019s so-called \u201cNo A**hole\u201d policy was unevenly enforced. Following the letter\u2019s release, the eight employees were fired. Wednesday\u2019s complaint alleges that \u201cMusk personally ordered the Plaintiff\u2019s terminations.\u201d SpaceX did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit. SpaceX does not typically respond to queries from news organizations. In response to the 2022 letter, SpaceX COO Gwynne Shotwell previously said she would enforce SpaceX\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d standards against employee harassment, but the The New York Times reported that she said the employees had been fired for making other staff feel \u201cuncomfortable.\u201d SpaceX previously faced similar complaints filed to the National Labor Relations Board over the termination of employees involved in the letter. Those complaints claimed that the terminations amounted to employees being fired for engaging in \u201cconcerted protected activities.\u201d One former employee who filed an NLRB complaint and is a plaintiff in the Wednesday lawsuit, Tom Moline, previously told CNN that SpaceX management used an \u201c\u2018ends justifies the means\u2019 philosophy to turn a blind eye to the ongoing mistreatment, harassment, and abuse reported by my colleagues, much of which was directly encouraged and inspired by the words and actions of the CEO.\u201d Earlier this year, SpaceX responded to a consolidated complaint from the NLRB with its own lawsuit, alleging that the structure of the NLRB itself is \u201cunconstitutional.\u201d Wednesday\u2019s complaint details the statements by Musk and the actions of other workers that the fired employees claim contributed to a hostile work environment and \u201cpervasively sexist culture\u201d at SpaceX. It points to multiple crude posts by Musk on Twitter, now called X, such as one containing a plan \u201cto create a Texas university similar to MIT which he would call \u2018TITS\u2019 and where \u2018Ds [women\u2019s bra size] would get degrees,\u2019 accompanied by an altered photo rendering a rocket to appear to be a giant penis,\u201d the complaint states. It also references a post from Musk, shared the day after Business Insider published a report claiming Musk had sexually harassed a flight attendant, in which the billionaire said: \u201cFinally, we get to use Elongate as scandal name. It\u2019s kinda perfect,\u201d along with a laughing emoji. (Musk has\u00a0denied\u00a0the harassment claims.) \u201cMusk\u2019s conduct of interjecting this juvenile, grotesque sexual banter into the workplace had the wholly foreseeable and intentional result of encouraging other employees to engage in similar conduct,\u201d Wednesday\u2019s complaint states. The former employees allege that engineers commonly applied \u201ccrude and demeaning names to products in an attempt at humor, often at the expense of women and LGBTQ+ individuals. For example, the name \u2018Upskirt Camera\u2019 was used for a camera on first stage of the Falcon rocket that views the bottom of the second stage,\u201d according to the complaint. In one instance, a SpaceX HR director responded to allegations of inappropriate workplace behavior at an internal event by saying: \u201cI\u2019ve never been sexually harassed; I must not be hot enough,\u201d the complaint alleges. The lawsuit adds that the former employees believe \u201cSpaceX has not taken action to redress the harassment, hostile work-environment, and retaliation.\u201d The former employees are seeking unspecified monetary damages to account for \u201clost wages, earnings, and other employee benefits, emotional distress.\u201d This story has been updated with additional details and context.

{"id": "2024_06_11_business_chiquita-banana-liable-paramilitary-group-colombia", "text": "A Florida jury on Monday found banana company Chiquita Brands International liable for financing the Colombian paramilitary group Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia (AUC). The jury in the civil case, in federal court in the Southern District of Florida, found that \u201cChiquita knowingly provided substantial assistance to the AUC to a degree sufficient to create a foreseeable risk of harm to others.\u201d Chiquita, one of the world\u2019s largest banana producers, has been ordered to pay a total of $38.3 million to the families of eight victims of the AUC, which was a far-right paramilitary group that was designated a terrorist organization by the US. The group disbanded in 2006, according to Stanford University\u2019s Mapping Militants Project. In an amended Florida lawsuit, which was filed in 2008, the plaintiffs alleged payments from Chiquita to the AUC propped up the paramilitary group\u2019s violence in Colombia and that the company should be held liable for the group\u2019s murders. In a statement to CNN, Chiquita said it planned to appeal the jury\u2019s verdict.  \u201cThe situation in Colombia was tragic for so many, including those directly affected by the violence there, and our thoughts remain with them and their families. However, that does not change our belief that there is no legal basis for these claims,\u201d the company\u2019s statement said. \u201cWhile we are disappointed by the decision, we remain confident that our legal position will ultimately prevail.\u201d Searcy Law, a law firm representing AUC victims and their families, applauded Tuesday\u2019s decision in a press release. \u201cThe verdict sends a powerful message: corporations will be held accountable when business decisions prioritize profits over human lives,\u201d\u00a0Searcy Law said. The lives of the victims were devastated as a result of violence by AUC, Searcy Law said. CNN has reached out to the victims\u2019 families. In 2007, Chiquita pleaded guilty to making over 100 payments to the AUC totaling over $1.7 million despite the group being designated a terrorist organization. Chiquita recorded the AUC payments as \u201csecurity services,\u201d though the company never received any actual services from these payments, according to a US Justice Department press release from the time. The company agreed to pay the US government a $25 million fine, the US said in its release. An unnamed company executive had told the Justice Department that the payments had been made under the threat of violence, according to the release. However, the Florida jury ruled that Chiquita failed to \u201cact as a reasonable businessperson would have acted under the circumstances.\u201d \u201cChiquita\u2019s claim that it was forced to support the terrorists because it was itself the victim of extortion was a defense expressly rejected by the jury,\u201d Searcy Law said. Searcy Law attorney Victoria Mesa-Estrada\u00a0said the verdict is a wake-up call for businesses to \u201cre-evaluate their operations and ensure they are not even indirectly supporting violence or human rights abuses.\u201d In a social media post, Colombia\u2019s president, Gustavo Petro, reacted to the American jury\u2019s Tuesday decision and asked why the same ruling was not made in his home country. \u201cWhy could US justice determine in judicial truth that Chiquita Brands financed paramilitarism in Urab\u00e1? Why couldn\u2019t Colombian justice?\u201d he said in a post on X translated from Spanish.  This story has been updated with additional details.
