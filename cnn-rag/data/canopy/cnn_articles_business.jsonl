Alfa Bank, controlled by sanctioned Russian oligarch Mikhail Fridman, has launched a website and support service in Chinese for businesses in the country, it said in a statement earlier this week. The bank is also planning to open branches in Beijing and Shanghai, it noted in the statement issued Tuesday. That would make the lender the first private Russian bank to open full-service branches in the two major Chinese cities. The move, which was announced in September, could help Russian clients do business with China \u201ceven more efficiently,\u201d it said at the time. CNN has requested further comment from the bank but hasn\u2019t received a response. \u201cDeveloping relations with China is one of the most important areas of work for the bank,\u201d the lender had said in a statement in February. The bank is part of Alfa Group, one of Russia\u2019s largest financial and investment conglomerates, which was founded by Fridman. Following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the United States and the European Union imposed sanctions on the group and individuals linked to it, as part of their sweeping punitive measures against Moscow. The sanctions hit Russian banks hard. Alfa Bank made a loss of 117.1 billion rubles ($1.44 billion) in 2022, according to its annual report for that year. A year later, it seemed to bounce back, reporting profit of 120.9 billion rubles ($1.4 billion) for 2023. China claims to be neutral on the war but has increased ties with Russia on many fronts. Last year, its trade with Russia hit a record $240.1 billion, up 26% from 2022, according to Chinese customs statistics. The two countries have also reduced their dependence on the US dollar, with about 95% of mutual payments made in Russian rubles or Chinese yuan last year, according to comments by a top Russian official during his visit to Beijing in November. Last week, at the Group of Seven summit in Italy, the US and its allies accused China of enabling Russia\u2019s war. G7 leaders also threatened further action, including sanctions, to punish Chinese entities that they say are helping Russia circumvent Western embargoes. In the Tuesday statement, Alfa Bank said it was already working with \u201cthousands\u201d of Chinese companies and had received a solid rating from a major Chinese credit rating agency. The Hong Kong Equity Investment Association had also recognized the bank as the \u201cmost technologically advanced\u201d lender, it added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/business/russia-alfa-bank-china-expansion-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_15_economy_good-news-inflation-may", "text": "\u201cGood news is bad news\u201d has been a common refrain for a while now. When economic reports are released that are solid, they have all too often been clouded with concerns that good news for the economy actually means a longer wait before the Federal Reserve rolls out rate cuts. This week, a string of good news was actually good news: Closely watched inflation gauges showed prices had cooled more than anticipated; Americans\u2019 financial outlooks were rosier than they have been in years while their inflation expectations dipped; and, on Friday, US import prices reversed course and fell sharply, adding fuel to the disinflationary fire. \u201cWhat we saw in the data is a reaffirmation of the idea that the economy, hiring, inflation are all cooling, which should create the conditions later this year for the Federal Reserve to relax their restrictive policy rate,\u201d said Joe Brusuelas, principal and chief economist for RSM US. \u201cAnd long-term interest rates will come down, which means the cost of financing, to purchase a car, a dishwasher or a washing machine or dryer, all will fall.\u201d He added: \u201cThat is good news.\u201d This week \u2014 with its multiple inflation reports, a Fed meeting, a new central bank rate cut timeline and economic projections, and a slew of ancillary data \u2014 had the makings of being a market-mover and a foreteller of the economic trajectory. And it sure did deliver. On Monday, new survey data from the New York Fed showed that US consumers reported increased optimism about their current and future financial situation, the stock market and the continued slowing of inflation. On Tuesday, the National Federation of Independent Business\u2019 optimism index hit the highest level of the year (although firms\u2019 uncertainty rose as well). But those data points were small fry as to what would come Wednesday. Inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index cooled more than expected in May, with prices holding flat on the month for the first time since July 2022. On an annual basis, consumer prices rose 3.3% from a year earlier,\u00a0slowing from April\u2019s 3.4% rate, Falling gas prices did their part, as did stable grocery prices, but a key gauge of underlying inflation also cooled. Core CPI rose just 0.2% for the month (its slowest pace since October of last year), and its annual rate dropped to 3.4%, setting a fresh three-year low. \u201cThe disinflationary trend we saw in 2023 is reasserting itself in that the seasonal noise that we typically see in inflation at the turn of the year was just that, \u2018noise,\u2019\u201d Brusuelas said. The soft CPI bolstered traders\u2019 expectations that interest rate cuts could now come as soon as September. The Fed, putting on its hawkish hat, tried to play spoilsport later that afternoon when it held rates at their current levels once again, and officials signaled only one rate cut for the remainder of the year, down from the three penciled in last December. The markets don\u2019t seem to be buying the one-cut plan, especially after the Producer Price Index on Thursday showed that wholesale prices fell from April to May and the BLS\u2019 Import and Export Price Index showed that US imports prices fell 0.4% in May after rising 0.9% in April. Excluding gas prices, imports still fell 0.3%. \u201cEverywhere Fed officials look, inflation is now in a cooldown phase after the worrisome first quarter flare-up,\u201d Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FwdBonds, wrote in a note on Friday. \u201cFed officials did not see what they were hoping for in the inflation trend when they met earlier this week, but the winds of change are coming for those bearish inflation outlooks as the economy may be slowing more than expected at the end of the second quarter.\u201d \u201cWe would not rule out a first rate cut in September; the market is not,\u201d Rupkey wrote. And more good news is likely on the way this next week and later this month, Brusuelas said. Inflation growing at a slower rate will give Americans more comfort in terms of overall spending, he said, adding that should be on display in next week\u2019s retail sales report. Additionally, the disinflation seen in the CPI and PPI are setting the stage for an equally softer report from the Fed\u2019s favored inflation gauge: The Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, which is due out at the end of the month.  \u201cThere\u2019s a real possibility we could see no increase on a monthly basis and that inflation slows into the 2.5% to 2.6% range,\u201d he said. \u201cAt that point, you\u2019re within spitting distance of the Fed\u2019s 2% target, and we have to seriously be talking about rate cuts in the near term.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/15/economy/good-news-inflation-may/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_media_nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash", "text": "Cesar Conde has a decision to make \u2014 and it\u2019s not an especially difficult one. The NBCUniversal News Group chair is facing a torrent of backlash from his own staff after greenlighting the hire of former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel as a paid network contributor. Over the last 24 hours, the most prominent and recognizable NBC News and MSNBC personalities have voiced strong displeasure with the company\u2019s decision to welcome McDaniel to \u201cthe team.\u201d And they\u2019re not doing it via anonymous comments to the press. They\u2019re doing it on the record on NBCU\u2019s own air. Chuck Todd broke the dam on Sunday\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with a set of candid comments about the hiring, and Rachel Maddow capped the flood of backlash Monday night with a blistering 30-minute monologue eviscerating the network\u2019s leadership for the \u201cinexplicable\u201d move. Suffice to say, NBCU News Group is in unprecedented territory. Never has a network\u2019s C-suite ever been so thoroughly flogged by its most high-profile stars in such no holds barred fashion. Saying that Conde simply has a crisis on his hands would be a contender for understatement of the year. It\u2019s a five-alarm fire at NBCU News Group, and one of Conde\u2019s own making. While NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown were most directly responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring, a decision that MSNBC boss Rashida Jones did not object to it at the time, the buck ultimately stops with Conde, who hold the real power at the Peacock Network. McDaniel\u2019s hiring could not have happened without Conde\u2019s blessing. It does not take a brilliant political mind with prescient foresight to understand that hiring McDaniel would ignite a firestorm of outrage \u2014 from both within 30 Rock and outside it. Conde, someone who ostensibly supports American democracy, should have rejected McDaniel\u2019s hiring on the grounds that NBCU News Group could not put someone on its payroll who tried to subvert the 2020 vote. As so many of NBCU\u2019s staffers have underscored, the objection to McDaniel is not that she is a Republican. It\u2019s not even that she is a Donald Trump-supporting Republican. It\u2019s that she was an active participant in the plot to overthrow the last presidential election. That is not to even mention McDaniel\u2019s years of demonizing the press, smearing the journalists who work at NBC News and MSNBC as she sought to destroy the credibility of the organization that she ran to after being chased out of the RNC. The notion put forward by NBC that it needed to hire McDaniel to bring its viewers \u201can insider\u2019s perspective on national politics and the future of the Republican Party\u201d is absurd. If that\u2019s the case, the network should move to hire free agents like Tucker Carlson or Candace Owens. They too have their hands on the pulse of the Republican Party. In fact, they represent much more of where the GOP stands today than McDaniel. So, using NBC\u2019s logic, why not hire them? (Spoiler: News organizations rightfully have established basic standards for paid contributors. Asking that your employees have a commitment to democracy, to the truth, and to basic decency is not a big ask.) But even if Conde has no allegiance to basic democratic principles, which this hire calls into question, given that he is known to be a political player who cares deeply about his own image in the press, he should have been wise enough to foresee that hiring McDaniel would be an ill-conceived move. How this did not occur to Conde is unfathomable and shows a tremendous lack of judgment. Even more bizarre is Conde\u2019s management, or lack thereof, since the controversy erupted. It was clear early on that his employees at NBC News and MSNBC did not support McDaniel\u2019s hiring. If that was not evident on Friday, it was clear as day on Sunday after \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d The network\u2019s employees were not only flabbergasted and demoralized by the move, but absolutely enraged by it. At that point, the writing should have been on the wall for Conde \u2014 as it was for every other media executive that I have spoken with over the last 24 hours. It is evident that McDaniel has no real future as an NBC analyst and the decision to bring her on as a contributor will have to be reversed. After all, which NBC or MSNBC program is going to invite her on after all of this? The only real question for Conde after the Sunday morning scolding should have been how he chose to back out of the deal in the least painful way possible. To be fully honest, I very much expected a Sunday evening announcement from NBC, one that would have earned praise from the company\u2019s staff and quickly been swept away by the rush of Trump news Monday morning. But no such announcement came. Instead, Conde has allowed the mess to spiral absolutely out of control. MSNBC\u2019s top stars hammered the network\u2019s leadership throughout the day Monday over the hire. NBC News\u2019 Guild blasted Conde, saying in a statement that under him the company had quietly laid off employees over the last month and instead chosen to \u201cprioritize an election denier over its reporters.\u201d The already severe crisis was allowed to blossom into one of the worst corporate public relations catastrophes in recent memory. All the while, Conde has remained silent. I asked his spokesperson, Stephen Labaton, on Monday whether the NBCU News Group boss had any comment on the situation. Does he have any regret? I didn\u2019t get an on-the-record response. Suffice to say, however, that what Conde does moving forward will say a lot about his character and commitment to democratic values. It will also say a lot about the NBCU News Group and what type of organization it is. In her biting monologue on Monday night, however, Maddow did offer Conde a way out of this mess. \u201cMistakes will be made,\u201d Maddow said.\u201dBut our resilience as a democracy is going to be recognizing when decisions are bad ones and reversing those bad decisions. Hearing legitimate criticism, responding to it, and correcting course. Not digging in. Not blaming others. Take a minute. Acknowledge that maybe it wasn\u2019t the right call.\u201d \u201cIt is a sign of strength, not weakness, to acknowledge when you are wrong,\u201d Maddow added. \u201cIt is a sign of strength. And our country needs us to be strong now.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/media/nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_20_success_interest-rates-savings-cash", "text": "The Federal Reserve\u2019s benchmark interest rate remains at a 23-year high. That\u2019s thanks to the central bank\u2019s decision Wednesday to once again hold it steady, as it has done at the policy-making committee\u2019s past five meetings. That decision may be disappointing to some investors, homebuyers and those with a lot of credit card debt, since movement in the Fed\u2019s overnight lending rate influences rates \u2014 directly or indirectly \u2014 on consumer financial products (e.g., credit cards, bank loans and mortgages). But\u00a0with the Fed signaling that no rate cuts are likely until summer, it also means anyone with savings still has at least a few more months to make hay of their stash. That\u2019s because you can still get inflation-beating interest rates that will grow any money you have set aside for emergencies, vacations, down payments or any other goal in your sights over the next several years. However, that won\u2019t happen if you just let it sit in a traditional checking or savings account that yields next to nothing. There are more lucrative, low-risk options out there, with rates that are still at or near their peaks. \u201cBut perhaps not for much longer,\u201d said Ted Rossman, senior analyst at Bankrate. \u201cIf one of those fits into your financial plans, it\u2019s best to act soon.\u201d So, consider the following options when deciding where to park your hard-earned savings. High-yield online savings accounts The average annual percentage yield on bank savings accounts was just 0.52% as of March 13, according to Bankrate. That average is kept low by the biggest brick-and-mortar banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, which still are offering a paltry 0.01%. By contrast, there are still FDIC-insured online banks offering inflation-beating rates of between 4.35% and 5.35% on their high-yield savings accounts. Generally speaking, these are the best vehicles in which to keep your emergency funds for quick, easy access. Choosing between an account that pays 0.52% and one that pays 5.35% can mean forfeiting hundreds of dollars in interest. \u201cIf you put $10,000 in a savings account, that\u2019s a difference of $496 in interest earnings over the course of the year, assuming monthly compounding,\u201d Rossman said. While the rates on high-yield savings accounts have gone down a bit in recent months, \u201cwidespread cuts in online savings account rates are unlikely until the first Fed rate cut is near,\u201d said Ken Tumin, founder of DepositAccounts.com. As with any bank savings rate, high-yield savings account\u00a0rates\u00a0can change overnight, and the bank may not alert you when it lowers it. So make sure to check your monthly statement. Certificates of deposits Another high-return, low-risk investment that is great for money you likely won\u2019t need to tap for a few months or even a couple of years is a certificate of deposit. You can get the best returns on CDs through a brokerage such as Schwab, E*Trade or Fidelity. That\u2019s because you can comparison shop for CDs from any number of FDIC-insured banks and will not have to set up individual accounts with each institution. As of March 13, the average rate on a one-year CD was 1.95%, but some banks are offering as much are 5.4%. If you can get a one-year CD at, say, 5.4%, you will make $540 on a $10,000 investment. To get the greatest benefit from a CD, you have to leave the money invested for a fixed period. You can always access your principal sooner if you need to, but there may be early withdrawal penalties. As of March 20, CDs listed on Schwab.com with durations from three months up to three years were all yielding between 5.2% and 5.51%. CD rates on durations between four and 10 years ranged from 4.40% to 5.15%. Say you invest $10,000 in a one-year CD with a 5.36%\u00a0APY. At the end of that period, you\u2019d get your principal back plus $536 in interest when the CD matures, according to Bankrate\u2019s CD calculator. If you chose a two-year CD at 5.25%, you\u2019d bank an extra $1,078, assuming compounding interest. The same investment in a five-year CD at 5.15% would earn $2,854. \u201cIt makes sense to go long with CDs. To hedge your bets, include terms from one to five years. Starting a CD ladder will provide this mix,\u201d Tumin said. If you don\u2019t go through a brokerage you may get a reasonable deal from your primary bank, Tumin said. For example, he noted, Wells Fargo is still offering up to 5.01% on both 4-month and 7-month CDs. Or, at Bank of America, you can get up to 4.75% on a 7-month CD. But Tumin cautions that with any big bank CD you should take your money out at the end of the term, otherwise your bank may automatically renew it and lock you in to a much lower-yielding CD. Money market accounts and funds If you don\u2019t want to set up an online savings account at another bank, your own bank may offer you a money market deposit account that pays a higher yield than your regular checking or savings accounts. Money market accounts may have higher minimum deposit requirements than a regular savings account, but they are more liquid than a fixed-term certificate of deposit or Treasury bill, meaning they give you access to your money more quickly while still potentially giving you some of the highest yields available, said Doug Ornstein, senior manager for integrated solutions at TIAA Wealth Management. But don\u2019t confuse money market accounts with money market mutual funds, which invest in short-term, low-risk debt instruments. As of March 19, they had an average 7-day yield of 5.14%, according to the Crane Money Fund Index, which tracks the top 100 taxable money market funds. Unlike money market deposit accounts, money market mutual funds are not insured by the FDIC. But if you invest in a money market fund through a brokerage, your overall account is likely to be insured through the Securities Investor Protection Corp, which offers protection in the event your brokerage ever goes under. Treasury bills and notes Another option for money you can leave untouched anywhere from several months to a few years is to buy short-term Treasury bills and medium-term notes, which are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. Three- and six-month bills had yields of 5.39% and 5.33%\u00a0respectively on March 20 before the Fed\u2019s meeting ended, while nine-month and one-year bills were offering 5.19% and 5.08%\u00a0respectively, according to rates posted on Schwab.com for a $25,000 investment. Rates on Treasury notes with durations from two years to 10 years ranged between 4.29% and 4.72%. If you\u2019re someone who manages your portfolio like a hawk, you may feel comfortable buying T-bills on your own from TreasuryDirect.gov. But if you don\u2019t, it might be easier just to buy new issues through your brokerage account or invest in a short-term bond index fund or ETF, said Andy Smith, executive director of financial planning at Edelman Financial Engines. And if you\u2019re looking at money that will be needed in three to five years, you might consider a diversified fund of highly rated government and corporate bonds, Ornstein said. An 18-month AAA-rated corporate bond, for instance, was yielding 4.82% this week, while the three-year was at 4.49%. Meanwhile, three-year AAA-rated municipal bonds (which are issued by local governments) had a rate of 3.98%, according to Schwab.com. Don\u2019t chase yield When deciding on the best accounts and investments for your specific goals and peace of mind, it may pay to consult a fee-only fiduciary adviser \u2014 meaning, someone who doesn\u2019t get paid a commission to sell you a particular investment. What you\u2019ll always want to do is build in flexibility for yourself so you can easily access cash, regardless of your timeline for key goals. \u201cWhat happens if something changes and you need that down payment a lot sooner \u2014 or your parents need medical care fast?\u201d Smith said. That means balancing your desire for great yield with a need and desire for ease of access without penalty. Translation: Don\u2019t chase yield for yield\u2019s sake. Think of it this way, Ornstein said: Unless you have huge sums to invest or are an institutional investor, the difference between getting a 5.1% yield versus 5% is negligible, and in fact it could even cost you more if there are penalties for taking your money out early. \u201cMost of the time convenience is really important. Give up the 0.1%,\u201d he advised.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/20/success/interest-rates-savings-cash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl", "text": "Sam Altman has agreed to return to lead OpenAI, the company said in a Tuesday post on X, just days after his surprise ouster as chief executive sparked an employee revolt that threatened to undermine what has been the leading company in the fledgling artificial intelligence industry. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman wrote that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft, which is the ChatGPT maker\u2019s biggest financial backer. The announcement appears to bring to an end days of chaos for the AI industry that included negotiations over who should lead OpenAI and how the firm should be run, as well as broader discussions about just how fast the arms race to develop AI technology should be moving. The details of Altman\u2019s firing and re-hiring remain murky. In its announcement Friday, OpenAI claimed that Altman had been insufficiently \u201ccandid\u201d with the board. That ambiguous language sent the rumor mill flying. But a key factor in Altman\u2019s ouster was the presence of\u00a0tensions between Altman, who favored pushing AI development more aggressively, and members of the original OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the crisis. As of Monday morning, Nadella had announced that Altman, along with fellow OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, would be joining Microsoft to lead a new AI research division. OpenAI said it had hired former Twitch chief Emmett Shear as interim CEO. But then hundreds of OpenAI employees, nearly the company\u2019s entire staff, threatened to leave, potentially for Microsoft, if the company\u2019s board didn\u2019t resign and reinstate Altman as CEO. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it invested billions in to help bolster its ambitions in developing AI, which many in Silicon Valley think will be the most important wave of technological advancement in the coming decades. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Microsoft CEO\u00a0Satya Nadella said on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d Altman\u2019s vision to quickly roll out and commercialize AI tools also appears to have won out. Publicly, Altman has long cautioned about risks posed by AI, and he\u202fhas pledged to lawmakers and customers that he would move OpenAI forward responsibly. \u201cIs [AI] gonna be like the printing press that diffused knowledge, power and learning widely across the landscape that empowered ordinary, everyday individuals that led to greater flourishing, that led above all to greater liberty?\u201d he said in a May Senate subcommittee hearing pressing for regulation. \u201cOr is it gonna be more like the atom bomb \u2014 huge technological breakthrough, but the consequences (severe, terrible) continue to haunt us to this day?\u201d But inside the company, Altman had been pushing to bring products to market more quickly and to sell them for a profit. Altman announced a few weeks ago at OpenAI\u2019s first-ever developer day that the company would make tools available so anyone could create their own version of ChatGPT. OpenAI has also worked with Microsoft to roll out ChatGPT-like technology across Microsoft\u2019s products. OpenAI and iPhone designer Jony Ive had also reportedly\u202fbeen in talks to raise $1 billion from Japanese conglomerate SoftBank for an AI device to replace the smartphone. \u2014 CNN\u2019s Juliana Liu and Diksha Madhok contributed reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "business"}}

But in May 2023, after CEO Bob Iger returned, the company\u00a0canceled the $1 billion Lake Nona office complex\u00a0amid a legal and political battle with Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis that has\u00a0since been settled. The plaintiffs, Maria De La Cruz and George Fong, both work for Disney\u2019s product design division. De La Cruz is vice president of product design, and Fong is a creative director, according to the complaint filed by\u00a0Lohr Ripamonti LLP on Tuesday. The lawsuit, which seeks an unspecified amount in damages, has not yet been processed by the Superior Court of Los Angeles. The complaint alleges that Disney misrepresented and concealed\u00a0its\u00a0true plans for the Lake Nona project,\u00a0hurting\u00a0\u2013 financially\u00a0and otherwise \u2013 at least\u00a0250 employees who had made the move from California to Florida. The complaint states employees were informed about the project to relocate 2,000 roles\u00a0to Florida in July of 2021 and that Disney \u201cmade it clear that employees who declined relocation would lose their jobs.\u201d The complaint\u00a0described\u00a0how De La Cruz and Fong sold their homes in Southern California and purchased homes in Central Florida. For Fong, that meant selling\u00a0the\u00a0childhood home that he inherited from his family. After the Lake Nona office project was canceled, De La Cruz\u00a0emailed human\u00a0resources about the future for those who might choose to stay in Florida,\u00a0writing: \u201cAfter all of this, will there be any security in our positions? My fear would be that we decide to stay in Florida, only to be laid off in the next year or so. I don\u2019t want to be punished for being put into a situation my company put me in,\u201d\u00a0the complaint says. The complaint says\u00a0De La Cruz and Fong decided\u00a0to move back to California to keep their jobs, but housing prices in the Lake Nona vicinity had dropped significantly after Disney\u2019s announcement. Fong\u00a0said\u00a0he\u00a0had trouble selling his Florida home, and when he managed to move back to California, mortgage rates and home prices had climbed so rapidly that he was only able to afford a smaller home than he previously had. \u201cMs. De La Cruz, Mr. Fong\u00a0and many others dutifully moved to Florida because they love their jobs, they love the people they work with, and they love Disney,\u201d Attorney Jason Lohr said. Disney has not replied to a request for comment. The company developing land in Lake Nona has confirmed with CNN that Disney still owns the 60 acres it had purchased for the new corporate campus. Disney has not said what will happen to this property.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/media/disney-employee-lawsuit/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "business"}}

Shares of the tech behemoth rose 2.1% to an all-time high close of $377.44 on Monday, beating the previous record of $376.17. That comes after shares of Microsoft fell 1.7% on Friday, when Sam Altman was ousted from his position at OpenAI in a boardroom coup. Microsoft is the artificial intelligence firm\u2019s biggest stakeholder, with a $13 billion investment in the company. Greg Brockman, who co-founded OpenAI and quit after Altman\u2019s firing, is also joining Microsoft. Altman\u2019s hiring ended days of speculation that the former chief executive could return to the firm after his dramatic firing. Emmett Shear, former CEO of Amazon-owned streaming service Twitch, will replace OpenAI chief technology officer Mira Murati as interim chief executive. Microsoft shares are up about 56% for the year. The stock is one of the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d that have powered the lion\u2019s share of the market\u2019s returns this year, boosted by Wall Street\u2019s bet that artificial intelligence is the next big thing in tech.

Other members of the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d saw a boost on Monday.

{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_ftc-tiktok-probe-privacy-and-security", "text": "The Federal Trade Commission is investigating TikTok for its data and security practices, two sources told CNN on the condition of anonymity. The probe is yet another complication for the social media platform, which is already facing the threat of a potential US ban or a forced divestment from its Chinese parent company. The sources said that the FTC is probing TikTok over an alleged violation of the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection rule, which requires companies to notify parents and obtain consent before collecting data from children under 13. The agency is also investigating whether TikTok violated a portion of the FTC Act that prohibits \u201cunfair or deceptive\u201d business practices, the sources said, in denying that TikTok user data could be accessed by individuals in China. The FTC could bring a suit against TikTok or settle with the company in the coming weeks, according to one of the sources. Politico reported news of the probe earlier. When asked about the investigation, FTC Director of Public Affairs Douglas Farrar replied: \u201cNo comment.\u201d TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The FTC probe comes as TikTok faces an existential threat in the US. Earlier this month, a bipartisan group in the US House of Representatives voted to pass a law forcing TikTok to be sold by ByteDance or face a ban from US app stores. The bill is now before the Senate, and President Joe Biden has said he would sign it if it gets to his desk. Senate leaders, however, have indicated they are taking a deliberate approach \u2014\u00a0which could lead to delays or even potentially doom the House bill. The short-form video company, owned by Chinese firm ByteDance, has denied assertions that its app poses a national security threat to US citizens. TikTok, which does not operate in China, has said that the Chinese government has never accessed US user data. Cybersecurity experts say Chinese laws require ByteDance to cooperate with that country\u2019s intelligence demands\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a fact that, given ByteDance\u2019s ownership of TikTok, could hypothetically put US user data at risk. To address that issue, TikTok has taken steps to store its US user data on cloud servers controlled by US tech giant Oracle and established internal protocols limiting access by non-US employees. TikTok acknowledged to Congress in 2022 that employees based in China could access US user data, following a report that year by BuzzFeed News that ByteDance employees had accessed that information on multiple occasions. TikTok CEO Shou Chew, in his first appearance before Congress last year, also acknowledged that several ByteDance employees were fired for spying on certain US journalists as part of a \u201cmisguided attempt\u201d to hunt down leakers within the company.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/ftc-tiktok-probe-privacy-and-security/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "business"}}

According to CEO and founder Rob Sims, digital humans can help bridge the gap between AI technology and people. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve found is when people start working with and conversing with a digital human, they very quickly suspend disbelief,\u201d Sims tells CNN. \u201cIt becomes natural.\u201d AI explosion Since OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT was launched in November 2022, considerable hype has surrounded the potential of generative AI \u2014 artificial intelligence powered by huge datasets of information, capable of generating text outputs in a conversational way. Record levels of investment into generative AI have followed, with over $21 billion poured into the industry during the first nine months of last year, according to data insights company Pitchbook. In March 2023, Google launched Bard (recently renamed Gemini) and around the same time Anthropic released its AI assistant Claude. As generative AI chatbots become increasingly ubiquitous, Sum Vivas is one of several companies looking to make them more human. US and New Zealand-based UneeQ has developed animated conversational \u201cdigital humans\u201d that can be used as virtual sales reps and customer service agents on company websites, and this month it debuted Sama 2.0, an animated cabin crew member that answers questions on Qatar Airways\u2019 website and app. Microsoft recently announced that users of its Azure software would be able to create lifelike avatars capable of turning text prompts into animated speech.

{"id": "2024_06_20_business_uk-private-school-fees-labour", "text": "Private schools in Britain conjure up images of rolling lawns, pristine tennis courts, and dormitory rooms, serving as gilded hothouses of privilege. Eton College, perhaps the most famous, has educated no fewer than 20 UK prime ministers. These schools may soon become even more exclusive if the opposition Labour Party wins the country\u2019s general election next month \u2014 which polls suggest it will do by a wide margin \u2014\u00a0and abolishes a long-standing 20% tax break on their fees. If Eton raises its fees by the full amount, rather than finding other ways to foot its bigger tax bill, parents sending their child to the illustrious school can expect to pay an extra \u00a310,500 ($13,360) per year on top of the current standard fees of \u00a352,750 ($67,107). Labour estimates that taxes on private schools will raise \u00a31.5 billion ($1.9 billion) a year, money it says is urgently needed to improve the state school system, which is used by about 93% of pupils. The policy appears to have widespread support \u2014 an opinion poll conducted last week by YouGov found that almost two-thirds of respondents backed the idea. But private schools are pushing back hard, saying it could mean financial ruin for many of them and force thousands of children \u2014 some from very modest backgrounds and with special educational needs \u2014 to switch to hard-pressed state schools. Not every private school is \u201csynonymous with privilege and great wealth,\u201d argues Sue Hannam, headteacher at Lichfield Cathedral School, a private school in central England. The vast majority of private, or so-called \u201cindependent,\u201d schools in the United Kingdom have \u201cvery little in common\u201d with their larger, more famous peers. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a number of parents where not only do both of (them) work, but some parents work more than one job\u2026 They\u2019re not driving the newest cars, they\u2019re not taking massive holidays,\u201d she told CNN. It is these parents \u2014 paying up to \u00a316,600 ($21,079) a year to educate a child at Lichfield \u2014 who are deeply concerned about the proposed tax, Hannam said. About 620,000 children are currently enrolled in private schools in Britain, equivalent to almost 6% of all school children, according to the Independent Schools Council. Collectively, the country\u2019s 2,500 private schools generate fee income of about \u00a39.42 billion ($12 billion) a year, based on CNN calculations using the ISC pupil numbers and figures from the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) on average school fees. And about half of private schools in England are registered as charities, according to the government, because, under English and Welsh law, they are involved in the \u201cadvancement of education\u201d and thus provide a benefit to the public. That status makes them eligible for an additional tax break \u2014 a discount of up to 80%, and sometimes more, on a tax applied to commercial properties \u2014 on top of the exemption to pay the 20% sales tax. In its manifesto, published last week, Labour says it plans to scrap both tax breaks. The funds would be spent on recruiting 6,500 new teachers for state schools, particularly in subjects where there are shortages, and giving students in every state school access to a mental health professional, among other plans. \u201cIn our state secondary schools, we\u2019ve got thousands of teachers missing in the subjects that we need,\u201d Labour leader Keir Starmer said on Sky News television earlier this month. \u201cLet\u2019s take maths: too many students\u2026 are being taught maths by sports teachers, by supply teachers, and that\u2019s not acceptable.\u201d Starmer argued that adding VAT to private schools fees was necessary to recruit teachers \u201cto make sure every child, wherever they come from, whatever their background, whichever school they go to, has the same opportunity.\u201d UK state-funded schools are beset with problems. On one key metric, the number of teachers recruited for the current academic year was 38% below the government\u2019s target. And, in a report in November, lawmakers said \u201cunacceptable numbers of pupils are learning in poorly maintained or potentially unsafe buildings.\u201d The VAT levy is likely to be passed on to parents, according to Louis Hodge, an associate director at the Education Policy Institute, an independent research organization. In theory, private schools could keep their fees relatively stable and make savings in their budgets. \u201cIn reality, that\u2019s probably not going to happen,\u201d he told CNN. An exodus? Labour has been advocating for an end to tax breaks for private schools for years, but concern among parents has grown over the past year or so, according to an ISC spokesperson, as a Labour government has become increasingly likely. In its latest annual report, the association said it had seen a 2.7% drop in the number of new students in its schools in the current academic year compared with the previous year. That is\u00a0the biggest annual decline since the ISC began collecting the data in 2011. Loveena Tandon, a single mother, sends her 16-year-old daughter and 14-year-old son to private schools in London at a cost of between \u00a342,000 and \u00a348,000 ($53,000-$61,000) a year. If enacted, Labour\u2019s policy makes it \u201chighly likely\u201d that she\u2019ll have to move them, she told CNN. \u201cMy son has just started making friends\u2026 it\u2019ll be devastating, the impact. I find it very hard to sleep at night figuring out what I need to do\u2026 (My daughter is) very well-settled\u2026 it\u2019s just cruel to take them out,\u201d she said. Julie Robinson, chief executive officer of the ISC, fears there will be many parents in Tandon\u2019s position under a Labour government. \u201cWhat we think will happen as a result (of Labour\u2019s VAT policy) is unfortunately tens of thousands of children will be displaced,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cThey\u2019ll have to seek another school (and), on the whole, they\u2019ll be going into the state system \u2014 and that means more pressure on the already stretched state system.\u201d Contrary to stereotypes, typical UK private schools work to \u201cvery tight budgets,\u201d are small \u2014 half of the schools represented by the ISC have fewer than 285 students \u2014 rural, and educate younger children, Robinson added. And a fifth of students in ISC schools have special educational needs, the association said in its annual report. \u201cIn recent years, independent schools have increased their fees assistance. Over a third of children in our schools receive some kind of fee discount already,\u201d Robinson said. ISC schools provide nearly \u00a31.1 billion ($1.4 billion) worth of support to parents to help with fees, up 6.8% from last year, according to the ISC\u2019s report. Christine Cunniffe, the principal of LVS Ascot, a private school in the southeast of England, predicts that a 20% hike to fees will result in her school\u2019s student population being 20% lower than it otherwise would be. That\u2019s because some parents are expected to take their children out of LVS Ascot, while others are likely to decline offers for their children to start at the school in September. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re bargaining for,\u201d Cunniffe told CNN. \u201cI just feel sorry for those children being wrenched away from their peers.\u201d \u2018Relatively small impact\u2019 Others, however, think the effect of Labour\u2019s taxes on private schools and the knock-on impact on their state-funded peers will be small. Hodge at the Education Policy Institute noted that, accounting for inflation, private school fees had risen by as much as 25% since 2010. \u201c(Over) that same time, we\u2019ve seen basically no change in the number of (students) that actually go to independent schools. That\u2019s remained pretty constant,\u201d he said. That would imply a \u201cpretty inelastic\u201d demand for private school education, h\ufeffe said. The private school sector is also \u201cmore dynamic than is appreciated,\u201d Luke Sibieta, a research fellow at the IFS, an independent think tank, told CNN. Since 2014, at least 20 to 30 schools \u2014\u00a0mostly smaller schools running on tight budgets \u2014 have shut each year, usually because they could not enroll enough students, he said. And the impact on state schools? The IFS estimates that the number of children in private schools will fall by between 20,000 to 40,000 over the next few years under Labour\u2019s tax policies compared with the scenario in which private schools continue to receive tax breaks. \u201cPeople moving from the private sector to the state sector clearly causes a demand on the state sector. We don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be huge, though,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cAdding VAT would probably have a relatively small impact.\u201d The IFS estimates that the extra students entering state schools will cost the public purse up to \u00a3300 million ($382 million) a year. Still, a demographic shift means state schools may \u201cwelcome\u201d the influx, Sibieta wrote last year. \u201cIt should be remembered that (student) numbers in the state sector are expected to fall dramatically over the next decade,\u201d he wrote.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/business/uk-private-school-fees-labour/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "business"}}

Beginning June 25, McDonald\u2019s US locations are selling a \u201c$5 Meal Deal\u201d for a limited time. It includes a McDouble cheeseburger or a McChicken sandwich, small french fries, 4-piece chicken nuggets and small soft drink. \u201cWe heard our fans loud and clear \u2014 they\u2019re looking for even more great value from us, and this summer that\u2019s exactly what they\u2019ll get,\u201d said Joe Erlinger, president of McDonald\u2019s USA, in a press release. Word of McDonald\u2019s newest value meal was released last month in the Wall Street Journal, prompting fast food rivals to get a jumpstart on offering similar deals and attract cost-conscious eaters. Burger King, Wendy\u2019s and even Starbucks have rolled out meal deals in recent weeks. The arrival of the McDonald\u2019s meal deal comes at a time when the company is battling the perception that it has become too expensive.

{"id": "2024_06_20_tech_tiktok-court-filing-biden-administration", "text": "TikTok ramped up its attacks on the Biden administration Thursday over a law that could ban the popular app from the United States, arguing in a court filing that US TikTok users could be forced to live on an \u201cisland\u201d of content disconnected from the rest of the world if the platform is forced to find a new owner. The legal filing also publicizes, for the first time, the text of a draft agreement between TikTok and the US government that the company claims would have addressed national security concerns linked to the app but that was allegedly discarded in favor of legislation that TikTok argues violates the First Amendment. Thursday\u2019s filing marks TikTok\u2019s opening salvo in a pivotal case that could not only determine the fate of an app used by 170 million Americans but also how courts interpret the First Amendment and its relationship to all online speech. The Justice Department declined to comment. TikTok has insisted it is not possible for its Chinese parent ByteDance to divest from the app \u2013 \u201cnot possible technologically, commercially, or legally\u201d \u2013 and not by the January 2025 deadline laid out by the law that President Joe Biden signed in April. \u201cEven if divestiture were feasible, TikTok in the United States would still be reduced to a shell of its former self, stripped of the innovative and expressive technology that tailors content to each user,\u201d the company wrote in its brief. \u201cIt also would become an island, preventing Americans from exchanging views with the global TikTok community.\u201d That is because the law TikTok is challenging prohibits the type of data-sharing agreements that would be necessary to display international TikTok content to US TikTok users, the company claimed in its filing. That dire warning echoed claims in a related legal brief filed by TikTok content creators Thursday. The group of creators, which includes a football coach, a sexual assault survivor advocate and a US Air Force veteran, argued that the challenged law would prevent them from choosing where and how to express themselves, as well as their First Amendment right to receive others\u2019 speech. Meanwhile, TikTok\u2019s focus on the draft agreement with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), a multi-agency panel charged with reviewing the national security implications of foreign investment deals, could prove central to the company\u2019s case. The proposed deal\u2019s existence, TikTok said, is evidence of a lighter-touch option that could have achieved the government\u2019s goals without a potential divestiture or app ban. Whether the Biden administration overlooked a less restrictive alternative could become a factor in a potential test of the law\u2019s constitutionality. In Thursday\u2019s filing, TikTok said the agreement was never signed despite years of negotiations and dozens of meetings and phone calls with US government officials. And after months of radio silence beginning in September 2022, CFIUS allegedly told TikTok in March 2023 that \u201c\u2018senior government officials\u2019 demanded divestment without explaining why the Agreement was insufficient.\u201d TikTok added that it then requested meetings with senior US officials but \u201creceived no meaningful responses.\u201d For years, US officials have warned of the possibility that the Chinese government could gain access to TikTok\u2019s user data through its influence over ByteDance. The Trump administration tried to ban TikTok by executive action, but that was quickly stymied by legal challenges. As Biden signed April\u2019s legislation, Trump reversed himself, saying a ban would only help TikTok\u2019s rival, Meta. Independent cybersecurity experts say the potential exists based on how China\u2019s laws are written, but that it so far remains a hypothetical and that there are many other sources of sensitive data China can freely obtain, for example by buying it on the open market. US officials have not publicly presented evidence that China has accessed US users\u2019 TikTok data. But they warn that information could be used to target propaganda or to identify intelligence targets, and they have given members of Congress classified briefings about the app\u2019s potential risks. TikTok, for its part, has denied ever giving the Chinese government access to its data and has blasted the confidential congressional briefings as part of a flawed, rushed and secretive legislative process. Attached to the company\u2019s brief on Thursday was an appendix containing the entire 103-page draft agreement. Outlining what has come to be known as Project Texas, TikTok\u2019s plan for segregating US user data from its global operation, the draft document also shows a provision that would entitle the US government to temporarily stop or even shut down TikTok\u2019s app if TikTok fails to comply with any of a dozen requirements, such as allowing qualified inspectors to review the company\u2019s source code.

{"id": "2024_06_20_economy_mortgage-rates-june-20", "text": "Mortgage rates fell this week to their lowest level since early April, taking some pressure off America\u2019s unaffordable housing market. The standard 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 6.87% in the week ending June 20, mortgage financing giant Freddie Mac reported Thursday. That\u2019s down from last week\u2019s 6.95% average and marks the third consecutive weekly decline. Rates are down from a 2024 peak of 7.22%. \u201cMortgage rates fell for the third straight week following signs of cooling inflation and market expectations of a future Federal Reserve rate cut,\u201d said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac\u2019s chief economist, in a release. \u201cThese lower mortgage rates coupled with the gradually improving housing supply bodes well for the housing market.\u201d Still, mortgage rates remain higher than anything seen in the decade before 2022, the year the Federal Reserve began to raise interest rates to combat inflation. Borrowing costs are poised to ease this year, but it may not be by much. Earlier this month, Fed officials penciled in just one interest rate cut for this year, compared to the three they forecast in March. The Fed doesn\u2019t directly set mortgage rates but its actions do influence them through the benchmark 10-year US Treasury yield, which moves in anticipation of the Fed\u2019s policy moves. Economists don\u2019t expect the average mortgage rate to fall below 6% this year. Homebuilding constrained by high interest rates While mortgage rates have eased recently, the US housing market overall remains hamstrung by elevated interest rates, which seem to be taking a toll on homebuilding. New home construction was much weaker than expected in May, according to separate government statistics released Thursday, with a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.28 million units in May, the lowest level since 2020 and down by 5.5% from April. That was well below the 1% gain economists projected in a FactSet poll. Building permits, seen as a forward indicator of future construction, also came in below economists\u2019 expectations. Additionally, sentiment among America\u2019s homebuilders fell in May to its lowest level since December, according to the National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index released Wednesday. \u201cPersistently high mortgage rates are keeping many prospective buyers on the sidelines,\u201d NAHB Chairman Carl Harris said in a release. \u201cHome builders are also dealing with higher rates for construction and development loans, chronic labor shortages and a dearth of buildable lots.\u201d A lack of homes on the market has been a longstanding issue for housing in America. Sluggish homebuilding doesn\u2019t help that, but housing inventory has improved in recent months as some Americans part with their homes. Expensive homes, big down payment Home prices remain sky-high, which is another key factor exacerbating America\u2019s affordability crisis. The S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller US National Home Price Index rose 6.5% in March from a year earlier to a record high, showing strong demand in urban population centers such as San Diego, Los Angeles and New York. It was the sixth time the index has reached a new record high over the past year. The index for April is due next week. The annual Demographic International Housing Affordability report, which has been tracking home prices for 20 years, showed that America\u2019s most expensive housing markets are in California. Honolulu, Hawaii\u2019s capital, was also listed as one of the most expensive in the world. Buyers are also having to come up with a huge down payment that\u2019s roughly double the median salary of a US worker. A median-income household would need to save up more than $127,000 for a down payment to afford a monthly mortgage payment on the typical US home, according to a recent Zillow analysis. \u201cSaving enough is a tall task without outside help \u2014 a gift from family or perhaps a stock windfall. To make the finances work, some folks are making a big move across the country, co-buying or buying a home with an extra room to rent out,\u201d Skylar Olsen, chief economist at Zillow, said in a release.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/economy/mortgage-rates-june-20/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_19_success_wall-street-bonuses", "text": "Last year wasn\u2019t the most lucrative for Wall Street bankers, but their bonus payouts still easily trounced US median household income. The average Wall Street bonus for 2023 was $176,500, according to estimates that will be released Tuesday morning by New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli. That\u2019s down 2% from the $180,000 recorded in 2022. Both those averages were well below the $240,000 paid out in 2021. That the average bonus was slightly down isn\u2019t surprising. Wall Street earnings last year were mixed, and merger and acquisition activity was underwhelming. \u201cWall Street\u2019s profits were up 1.8% in 2023, but firms have taken a more cautious approach to compensation and more employees have joined the securities industry, which accounts for the slight decline in the average bonus,\u201d DiNapoli said in a statement. Nevertheless, a little perspective: The average Wall Street bonus, which comes on top of the nearly half-a-million-dollar average Wall Street salary, was itself almost 2.5 times higher than the median US household income of $74,580, according to Census data for 2022. Wall Street bonuses and general employment in the securities industry provide vital revenue streams for the New York State and New York City economies, accounting most recently for 27% of the state\u2019s tax collections and 7% of city tax revenue, according to DiNapoli\u2019s office. The securities industry \ufeffin the city employed roughly 198,500 people last year, up from 191,600 the year before. And DiNapoli estimates that 1 in 11 of the city\u2019s jobs are either directly or indirectly associated with the industry. The total estimated bonus pool for 2023 was\u00a0slightly lower than the year before and is\u00a0projected to bring in $4 million less in state income tax revenue and $2 million less for the city revenue than bonuses in 2022 did. Still, DiNapoli noted, \u201cWhile these bonuses affect income tax revenues for the state and city, both budgeted for larger declines so the impact on projected revenues should be limited.\u201d It should be noted that the comptroller\u2019s numbers only reflect the bonuses paid to securities industry employees working for firms based in New York City. Beyond bringing in tax revenue for government coffers, Wall Street workers contribute substantially to the local Gotham economy. DiNapoli said that more employees in financial services (65%) are working in-office on any given day compared to 58% working in other industries in the city, at least as of September 2023. And that securities industry employees use the subway more than other workers in the city. All in, he estimates that Wall Street is responsible for roughly 14% of economic activity in the city. As critical as that is, the city and state are about much more than just Wall Street. \u201cThe securities industry\u2019s continued strength should not overshadow the broader economic picture in New York, where we need all sectors to enjoy full recovery from the pandemic,\u201d DiNapoli said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/19/success/wall-street-bonuses/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_19_tech_car-dealership-cdk-cyber-incident-outage", "text": "US and Canadian auto dealerships remained at a near-standstill on Thursday because of a second cyber incident at data provider CDK Global, whose software is used at 15,000 auto dealers \u2013 an outage that could last for days, perhaps eating into sales over the first official weekend of summer. On Wednesday, CDK spokesperson Lisa Finney said in a statement shared with CNN: \u201cWe are actively investigating a cyber incident. Out of an abundance of caution and concern for our customers, we have shut down most of our systems and are working diligently to get everything up and running as quickly as possible.\u201d Later that day the company announced that most of the critical computer systems were back online. But Thursday morning, the company sent dealerships another message indicating things had a taken a turn for the worse. \u201cLate in the evening of June 19, we experienced an additional cyber incident and proactively shut down most of our systems. In partnership with third party experts, we are assessing the impact and providing regular updates to our customers,\u201d CDK said in a statement shared Thursday morning. \u201cWe remain vigilant in our efforts to reinstate our services and get our dealers back to business as usual as quickly as possible.\u201d The company later told dealers the systems could be down for several days, according to two sources briefed on the situation. CDK operates numerous different products that car dealers use to handle things like keeping records of negotiated deals to scheduling and communicating about service. Not every dealer uses CDK\u2019s products, and even those that do may not use them for everything, but the system shutdown has been a problem for many. \u201cWe have customers coming in today who had deals saved in the system,\u201d said Jeff Ramsey, an executive with Ourisman Auto Group, which is headquartered in Maryland. To protect customer privacy, customers\u2019 details aren\u2019t written out on a piece of paper that\u2019s just sitting on a desk anymore. Instead, information about deals and customer appointments is kept in a server that\u2019s now impossible for his salespeople to access. How this affects buying a car now Ramsey said he understands, though, that CDK is doing what it feels it must to secure this sensitive data. But it\u2019s a major hassle in the meantime and could cost his dealerships some business. Customers who are delayed in closing a sale at one of his dealerships could just find a dealer nearby that\u2019s not having these issues and buy a new vehicle there, instead. It\u2019s car buying season, so it\u2019s a real concern. \u201cWe\u2019re in the summer months,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is where we need systems functioning.\u201d Ramsey and Brian Benstock, general manager of Paragon Honda and Paragon Acura in Long Island City, New York, both said they were continuing to do business and were selling cars in spite of the problems. \u201cMy selling team can hand-write a buyer\u2019s order,\u201d said Benstock. But salespeople could lack access to customer agreements that had been previously negotiated, making it harder to close those sales, dealers CNN spoke with said. There\u2019s more than just the negotiated price of the car involved, since these agreements can involve rebates and incentives, some of which customers must show they\u2019re qualified for. Ramsey, whose company operates a number of dealerships, said automakers including Kia, Toyota and Stellantis, which makes Jeep and Dodge vehicles, have been very helpful with finding ways serve customers even with all technology issues. Ford also said its dealerships involved in the CDK outage have alternate ways to take care of customers. \u201cAlthough there is an industry-wide system outage for some dealers who use CDK, Ford and Lincoln customers are able to receive sales and service support due to alternative processes available to our dealers. While a customer\u2019s local dealer remains the best place for information about their sales and service needs, they can always contact the Ford Customer Relationship Center at 1-800-392-3673,\u201d Ford said in a statement shared with CNN. Not just car sales, but parts and service can also be disrupted. The bigger hassles will be for the dealership\u2019s accountants and businesspeople, Benstock said. Plenty of his employees have been in this business since before it became networked and computer dependent, he said, but it\u2019s still a problem and he\u2019s still worried about customer data.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/tech/car-dealership-cdk-cyber-incident-outage/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_21_opinions_sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic", "text": "The biggest tech news this week is the\u00a0ouster\u00a0of Sam Altman from his role as CEO of OpenAI, a move that has shaken the company and the industry. Hundreds of OpenAI employees have threatened to\u00a0resign. Altman has already\u00a0moved on\u00a0to a role at Microsoft. And OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is on its\u00a0third CEO\u00a0in as many days. It\u2019s all very juicy. But this drama should also be raising larger questions, far beyond one company\u2019s internal hirings and firings, including: Who are the people making the decisions\u00a0that will determine so much of our technological future? What guiding principles are they using to make those decisions? And how should other institutions \u2013 governments, non-tech industries, global alliances, regulatory bodies \u2013 reign in the worst excesses of potentially dangerous AI innovators? OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, with an explicit mission to harness what may soon be superhuman intelligence \u201cto benefit humanity as a whole.\u201d But that sensibility hasn\u2019t lasted. The company now has a multi-billion-dollar for-profit arm. They have been developing new technologies at lightning speed, and sometimes sending them out to the public\u00a0before some employees believed they were ready. The company has already reportedly invented an AI technology so dangerous they will never release it \u2013 but they also\u00a0won\u2019t tell\u00a0reporters or the public exactly what it is. This dynamic \u2013 a potentially dangerous technology developed at extreme speed, largely behind closed doors \u2013 is partly to blame for Altman\u2019s firing. The OpenAI board, according to\u00a0CNN\u2019s David Goldman, worried that \u201cthe company was making the technological equivalent of a nuclear bomb, and its caretaker, Sam Altman, was moving so fast that he risked a global catastrophe.\u201d At particular issue seemed to be Altman\u2019s efforts to make the tools behind ChatGPT available to anyone who wanted to make their own version of the chatbot. This could be widely disastrous, some board members worried. But then they fired him without warning, and apparently without involving Microsoft, the company\u2019s largest shareholder. Now, Altman is at the new AI group at Microsoft, and one has to wonder if the oversight and caution there will be on par with that at OpenAI, or if he\u2019ll be handed carte blanche to push as fast and hard as he wants. And for all the justified reticence of the OpenAI board, the company has carried out much of its work in secrecy \u2013 without the public really understanding what a handful of unaccountable technologists are building, and how it is nearly guaranteed to indelibly change their lives. AI is broadly understood to have the potential to reshape vast swaths of human existence. At the very least, it seems nearly guaranteed to change how we process information, how we communicate, how we learn and how we work (and if we work). And the ramifications could be much more extreme. AI technologies have already demonstrated the ability\u00a0to lie and to cover their tracks. They have already been able to\u00a0suggest the design\u00a0to make a virus spread more quickly. Many researchers\u00a0acutely understand\u00a0just how quickly these machines could develop the capacity to annihilate us, including Altman: He has a prepper\u2019s paradise prepared in Big Sur, complete with guns and \u201cgas masks from the Israeli Defense Force\u201d in case AI goes off the rails and the robots go to war against humans,\u00a0according to reporting in the New Yorker. But don\u2019t worry, he told an Atlantic reporter: If AI is determined to wipe us out, \u201cno gas mask is helping anyone.\u201d (If you want an excellent and terrifying rundown of AI\u2019s risks \u2013 at least those we understand right now, which are almost certainly a mere sliver of the looming perils \u2013\u00a0the Atlantic profile of Altman and his technology\u00a0is worth a read). AI is very exciting technology. But it is also a potentially very dangerous one, and not in the social media sense of \u201cit may give us bad self-esteem and make us lonelier\u201d but in the sense of \u201cit could break down human societies and kill us all.\u201d Given the life-altering potential of AI \u2013 that even if it doesn\u2019t kill us all, it will almost certainly change human existence in unprecedented ways at unprecedented speed \u2013 we all have a stake in how it\u2019s being developed. And yet the development is being left to a handful of people (who seem to be\u00a0largely\u00a0men) in Silicon Valley, and other tech pockets around the globe. And we all have a stake in whose interests AI will serve \u2013 and right now, its development is being funded with billions of dollars by people expecting to make a huge profit. Do the interests of the public align with the interests of the shareholders to whom profit-driven, potentially tremendously lucrative-for-a-few companies are beholden? Or with the interests of tech entrepreneurs who are primarily excited about being at the forefront of the AI revolution, regardless of the potential human costs? One thing is clear: AI is coming. And how it is built and unleashed on the public matters more than perhaps any technology of the past century. It is, indeed, up there with the atom bomb in its destructive potential \u2013 except likely more difficult to regulate and control. \u201cRegulation\u201d does not begin to scratch the surface of what\u2019s needed to make sure that the AI future is not a catastrophic one, especially since the development of AI is now a massive international arms race, with particularly horrific implications if bad actors develop this technology first. But regulation is, at minimum, a necessary step. So is transparency: In the US, companies have wide leverage to work behind a veil of secrecy, and much of what AI companies do is kept secret to stymy competition. But the public certainly has a right to understand what life-altering technologies are set to be inflicted upon us, and what the creators are doing to protect humanity \u2013 our jobs, our communities, our families, our connections, our educations and our abilities to build a life of purpose, but also our lives and our safety. The Altman story is fascinating because Altman is the most powerful figure in AI technology, which in effect makes him one of the most powerful men in the world. But that should give us pause: Who is he, what power does he hold, what is he doing with it, who does he answer to, and are we comfortable with this much life-altering potential being held by a few unaccountable people?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/21/opinions/sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "business"}}

You can sign up\u00a0right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link. Stocks are trading near record highs after Wall Street received long-awaited clarity on the path for inflation and interest rates. Can that last? The market has been on a tear in 2024, driven higher by robust corporate earnings and the artificial intelligence boom. That rally has been challenged in recent months by a slew of hotter-than-expected inflation reports and economic data, which spurred concerns that the Federal Reserve would wait longer than expected to cut rates. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indexes both clinched several record closes last week as cooler-than-expected May Consumer and Producer Price Index reports raised Wall Street\u2019s hopes that inflation is coming down again. Still, the Fed held interest rates steady on Wednesday and signaled just one cut for this year, fewer than the three it previously projected. Traders expect the Fed to begin easing rates in September at the earliest, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. If inflation is cooling down but the Fed is still expected to keep its key lending rate higher for longer, what does that mean for the stock market? Before the Bell spoke with Jack Janasiewicz, lead portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers Solutions, to discuss. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Before the Bell: What is your biggest takeaway from last week? Jack Janasiewicz: The bottom line \u2026 is that there\u2019s a disinflationary impulse coming. I think [Fed Chair Jerome] Powell was right to sort of look at [hotter-than-expected] January, February, March inflation data as maybe a little bit of an anomaly or a pause but not a reversal of that trend that\u2019s going to continue to head to that 2% target. So, again, heading in the right direction, it may be slower than people would like. But we\u2019re going to 2%. And then the other thing I would point to as well \u2014 the labor side of their mandate is becoming a little more focused. [The Fed] is one of the only central banks that has the dual mandate with price stability and full employment. It feels like the price stability side is coming into better focus. As the economy slows a little bit here, and you start to see the unemployment rate tick a little bit higher \u2026 the Fed [could start] to focus on making sure that the unemployment rate doesn\u2019t start to rise. That could be the trigger for rate cuts. So we\u2019re not ruling out rate cuts by September. We could easily have a cut. The data will tell us that, but I think the big takeaway for us is [inflation] going in the right direction. What is the implication for stocks? This is sort of a Goldilocks scenario for stocks where we\u2019ve got inflation trending lower, but it\u2019s still a little bit elevated above the target, which is going to be good for corporate profits, and the economy is still growing above trend. And even if we slow, keep in mind where we\u2019re starting from. You\u2019re starting from an above-trend growth rate. So if you slow maybe we slow to trend. That\u2019s a pretty good backdrop. That\u2019s good for corporate earnings. And that\u2019s, not surprisingly, why the market continues to hold up. I wouldn\u2019t be shocked if we get a pullback, but the underlying economy is still pretty strong, and we\u2019re basically going to tell our clients that any pullback, you should be looking to add on. So if we get a 5% or 10% correction in equities over the next month or two, you should be putting money to work, not de-risking here, because the fundamentals are still very strong for the economy. Do you expect some of the cash that\u2019s on the sidelines to enter the stock market? Some of that will come back in, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to see all of it, only because you\u2019re still earning a pretty good yield on money market accounts. People have cash as cash, and it\u2019s kind of its own bucket. So swapping that bucket for an equity risk, it\u2019s not quite the same. But I think some of that will find its way back into the markets. We still have plenty of clients that are pretty defensively positioned because they don\u2019t believe in this market rally, they think it\u2019s overhyped, the economy is still going to slow. So there is room for some of that money to come back in, but some of it I think is still pretty sticky. These cities are now so expensive they\u2019re considered \u2018impossibly unaffordable\u2019 Anyone with half an eye on the housing market over the last two decades will know that in many countries, not least the United States, it\u2019s become much more difficult to buy a home. But a new report sums up the feeling of many potential home buyers by creating a category that labels some major cities as \u201cimpossibly unaffordable,\u201d reports my colleague Hilary Whiteman. The report compared average incomes with average home prices. It found that pandemic-driven demand for homes with outside space, land use policies aimed at limiting urban sprawl, and investors piling into markets had sent prices soaring. US cities on the West Coast and Hawaii occupied five of the top 10 most unaffordable places, according to the annual Demographic International Housing Affordability report, which has been tracking house prices for 20 years. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the most expensive US cities to buy a home are in California, where San Jose, Los Angeles, San Francisco and San Diego have all made the top 10. The Hawaiian capital of Honolulu also rates a mention in sixth place of 94 major markets surveyed in eight countries. Australia is the only other country besides the US to dominate the \u201cimpossibly unaffordable\u201d list, led by Sydney and\u00a0the southern cities of Melbourne in Victoria and Adelaide in South Australia.

The complicated partnership between Apple and OpenAI When OpenAI CEO Sam Altman attended Apple\u2019s annual developer conference last week, he walked the campus, mingling with current and former executives, including Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak. Nearly an hour later, the iPhone maker announced a much-rumored partnership with OpenAI to bring its ChatGPT technology to devices this year. But Altman, who has emerged as the poster child for generative AI in the 18 months since the launch of ChatGPT, was not featured in Apple\u2019s formal presentation, neither in person nor via livestream, reports my colleague Samantha Murphy Kelly. Nor did he join Apple CEO Tim Cook and other executives in a private press event about privacy and security and the partnership between the two companies. \u201cI was not surprised Sam Altman did not appear on stage,\u201d said Ben Wood, an analyst at market research firm CCS Insight in an interview with CNN. \u201cApple had to manage the message carefully. OpenAI is merely the vehicle to address broader AI-powered inquiries that are not core to the Apple experience. Having him in the livestream would have only created an unnecessary level of confusion.\u201d Earlier last week, Apple showed off a handful of AI-powered features coming to the iPhone, iPad and Mac in the fall \u2014 the majority of which are fueled by the company\u2019s own proprietary technology, called Apple Intelligence. The company will offer OpenAI\u2019s viral ChatGPT tool in a limited capacity, usually only when Siri is activated and needs more assistance answering an inquiry. The move to invite Altman to the announcement but not have him appear before the public also represents in some ways how Apple is cautiously moving forward with the partnership.

{"id": "2024_03_22_media_ronna-mcdaniel-nbc", "text": "NBC News on Friday announced that it had hired Ronna McDaniel, the former Republican National Committee chair who has repeatedly\u00a0attacked the network and its journalists,\u00a0assailed the\u00a0news\u00a0media as \u201cfake news\u201d and promoted false claims around the 2020\u00a0vote,\u00a0as an on-air commentator\u00a0ahead of the 2024 presidential election. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be a more important moment to have a voice like Ronna\u2019s on the team,\u201d Carrie Budoff Brown, senior vice president of politics at NBC News, said in a memo\u00a0to staff. McDaniel exited the RNC earlier this month after leading the organization since 2016. During her time as chair, McDaniel repeatedly attacked the press, which has become increasingly popular in Republican circles over the last several years as Donald Trump demonizes journalists and news institutions. McDaniel echoed many such attacks, labeling the press as \u201cfake news\u201d and calling the media \u201ccorrupt.\u201d At times, she even targeted NBC News\u00a0and MSNBC\u00a0with dishonest attacks. In 2019, for instance, McDaniel accused Richard Engel, NBC News\u2019 chief foreign correspondent, of \u201cactively cheering for an economic downturn.\u201d \u201cHow can NBC let him keep his job when he\u2019s made his bias so clear?\u201d McDaniel asked. McDaniel has a lengthier history attacking the progressive cable news channel MSNBC, which she will appear on in her new role. In recent years, she has repeatedly attacked the channel for \u201cspreading lies\u201d and blasted those she described as the network\u2019s \u201cprimetime propagandists.\u201d An NBC spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment about her attacks on the news media and NBC. In her role as RNC chief, McDaniel also fanned the flames of election denialism after the 2020 presidential contest. McDaniel was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d The Michigan Department of State\u2019s office condemned her claims of supposed voter fraud in the wake of the election, stating they had \u201cno merit.\u201d\u00a0The state\u2019s \u201celections were conducted fairly, effectively and transparently and are an accurate reflection of the will of Michigan voters,\u201d it said in a\u00a0detailed fact check\u00a0posted online. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Chris Wallace last year, McDaniel defended her claims of voting \u201cirregularity\u201d in the election. \u201cI think saying that there were problems with 2020 is very real. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s election denying,\u201d McDaniel told Wallace. \u201cI\u2019m from Wayne County. We had a woman send a note saying I\u2019m being told to backdate ballots. We had to look into that. That\u2019s deeply concerning. When you have friends who are poll-watching and being kicked out, that\u2019s deeply concerning. We have every right to look at that.\u201d In the interview,\u00a0Wallace pressed McDaniel if she believed Biden legitimately won the election. \u201cI think there were lots of problems with 2020. Ultimately, he won the election\u00a0but there were lots of problems with the 2020 election,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think he won it fair. I don\u2019t. I\u2019m not going to say that.\u201d NBC\u2019s hiring of McDaniel, however, plays into a recent trend at the\u00a0network\u2019s outlets, which has seemingly softened its stance on Trump as he inches toward the Republican nomination for president. Earlier this month, CNBC hosted Trump for a lengthy phone interview in which the network\u2019s anchors allowed him to peddle lies and conspiracy theories on air\u00a0without scrutiny. MSNBC has even started carrying Trump\u2019s remarks live on television, a practice that the network boasted for years it would not do. Star host Rachel Maddow, who has said carrying Trump\u2019s lies\u00a0on the air\u00a0is dangerous, even objected to the network broadcasting a recent speech from the presumptive Republican nominee, calling it \u201cirresponsible.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/22/media/ronna-mcdaniel-nbc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_01_tech_aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl", "text": "A London-based technology company is looking to \u201cdemocratize\u201d talent-identification and scouting in soccer using a mobile app. Free to download and available globally, the aiScout app allows aspiring soccer stars to enter virtual trials for professional clubs by uploading self-recorded footage of themselves completing a series of drills. It offers 75 exercises, designed to test a range of skills, with videos showing users how to complete them. Performances are automatically scored by artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The data can then be accessed by clubs, allowing their scouts to peruse scores for viable talent, honing their search with a variety of filters; from age and gender to position on the pitch. The app currently has two English Premier League (EPL) partners, Chelsea and Burnley, and clubs can tailor their in-app trials to meet specific needs and set their own benchmarks by having their academy players complete the same drills. \u201cWe\u2019re putting that data up front to make better use of [the scouts\u2019] time,\u201d said Richard Felton-Thomas, chief operating officer of ai.io, the company behind the app. \u201cTo say [to scouts], \u2018Go over to this place today because there\u2019s three players in that game that are all actually beating your Chelsea standard\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s going to be the best use of your time.\u2019\u201d It already appears to be working for some. Ben Greenwood had never had a trial with a professional club until he downloaded the app in 2019. After uploading footage of himself, the 17-year-old landed a trial with Chelsea, becoming the first user of the app to get a trial with a pro club. He signed a contract\u00a0with EPL team Bournemouth\u00a0in 2021. \u2018It\u2019s more about evolution\u2019 Having beta-tested in with players spanning 125 countries, Greenwood among them, 135 players have been trialed or signed by pro clubs or national teams through the app \u2014 which fully launched in September 2023 \u2014 according to Felton-Thomas. Just over 100,000 players make up the current database, but with over 100 clubs lined up to join Chelsea and Burnley, as well as a multi-year partnership with Major League Soccer in the US announced last May, Felton-Thomas projects user numbers to surge into the millions as the operation ramps up this year. Felton-Thomas said the \u201clion\u2019s share\u201d of its income comes from charging clubs a license fee to run the platform. Annual fees vary depending on the size of the club and the tools they require, ranging from six figures for \u201ctier one\u201d sides like Chelsea, to thousands of pounds for clubs lower down the footballing pyramid. The use of smart technology in sport continues to expand, including\u00a0AI commentary tools and wearable tech for elite athletes. The global market for sports analytics, valued at\u00a0$2.7 billion\u00a0in 2023, is projected to grow 22% by the end of the decade, according to market research firm Grand View Research. Should soccer talent scouts be concerned about being edged out by the arrival of AI in their industry? For Felton-Thomas, new technologies can co-exist with traditional methods. \u201cIt\u2019s more about evolution than revolution,\u201d Felton-Thomas explained. \u201cWe can\u2019t tell you when that player\u2019s actually in that match, how does he deal with adversity? What happens when he\u2019s 2-0 down? What happens when someone\u2019s shouting at him? What happens when he\u2019s just made a massive mistake?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got the ability to just augment real people to do their jobs better and faster, which then gives an opportunity to the player through the AI, but you\u2019re still actually just connecting them to the human on the other side, which is the club and the scout.\u201d While football remains ai.io\u2019s primary focus, the company is looking into opportunities in other sports to launch in the coming years. Further ahead, it may branch out beyond sports. \u201cYou think about the notion that you can be at home and analyze your movements, and how this could spin into health care, physical assessments for military disciplines and emergency services,\u201d Felton-Thomas told CNN.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/01/tech/aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2022_04_27_business_diamonds-manmade-demand", "text": "It\u2019s proposal season, and engagements are on the rise. So are factory-made diamond sales. Not that you\u2019d know the difference. Man-made diamonds look the same as naturally occurring ones. The only noticeable difference is the price tag. \u201cThe result is really stunning,\u201d said Edahn Golan, an independent diamond industry analyst. He said March data showed the number of engagement rings sold that featured a manufactured diamond jumped 63% compared to last year, while the number of engagement rings sold with a natural diamond declined 25% in the same period. Going back by another month, to February, the data showed the number of rings sold with lab diamonds that month surged even more, to 80% compared to a year earlier while the number fell by 13% for natural diamond engagement rings.  \u201cThe big fear in the natural diamonds industry is that consumers will start accepting lab-grown diamonds in engagement rings,\u201d he said. Too late. \u201cIt\u2019s actually happening.\u201d  Tide is shifting Why are consumers flocking to man-made diamonds? Cost is the most obvious reason. The average retail price of the most popular one carat round man-made diamond for an engagement ring in March was $2,318, Golan said. \u201cThis is substantially less \u2013 as much as 73% cheaper \u2013 than a natural diamond of the same size, cut and clarity as the man-made diamond, which would cost $8,740,\u201d he said. Plus, the lower cost allows couples to buy a bigger stone.  \u201cA lab diamond is a real diamond, but maybe it took a few weeks to make it,\u201d said Golan. \u201cNatural diamonds were formed over 800 million to three billion years and there isn\u2019t an infinite supply of them.\u201d  This makes natural diamonds quite a bit more expensive, and prices are likely to rise as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has tightened the supply chain for natural raw diamonds. The sanctions directly target Alrosa, partly owned by the Russian government, which the US government identified as the world\u2019s largest diamond mining company, accounting for 28% of global diamond output. Man-made diamonds are also becoming popular as consumers are more aware and educated about them, said Dan Moran, a third-generation diamond expert and owner of LA-based fine jeweler Concierge Diamonds. Moran said the typical buyer of man-made diamonds is typically younger than 40 and very budget conscious. Mined diamonds have a controversial history that\u2019s tied to the use of child labor in some African diamond mines as well as sales of illegally-traded \u201cconflict diamonds\u201d that fund conflict in war-torn areas. Among Millennials and Gen Z, their eco-conscious mindset and ethical concerns about natural diamond sourcing is another factor influencing their preference for non-traditional engagement rings, according to a report from wedding planning website The Knot. Small but growing share of the diamond market Although its slice is growing, the market share for man-made diamonds remains relatively small. Currently, about 7% of the specialty diamond jewelry market is represented by man-made diamonds, up from 3% in 2020, said Golan.  Some major jewelry retailers are driving the effort to take man-made diamonds mainstream. In 2021, the world\u2019s largest jewelry company, Pandora\n            \n                (PANDY), made a major shift by announcing it would stop using mined diamonds and would swap to lab-created diamonds in its jewelry.  Pandora said it\u2019s instituting the change as part of an effort to sell sustainable jewelry, and also because consumers increasingly are asking for it. Signet,\n            \n                (SIG) the largest jewelry company in the United States (which owns Zales, Kay Jewelers and Jared chains) called out the popularity of lab diamond jewelry in its March earnings call with analysts. Calling it a \u201cfast-growing category\u201d in its jewelry portfolio, Signet CEO Virginia Drosos told analysts that lab-created diamonds are among the big jewelry trends she expects this year.  The company said it has expanded its man-made bridal jewelry selection in both its Zales and Kay Jewelers stores in response to the increased demand.  Fine jewelry brand Charles and Colvard, which makes lab-created diamonds, said consumers don\u2019t just want to look good with the jewelry they are wearing, they also want to feel good about it. \u201cAs the momentum for conscious consumerism grows, the surge towards lab grown diamonds isn\u2019t surprising,\u201d said Don O\u2019Connell, president and CEO of Charles & Colvard. \u201c[Consumers] want to know the origins of their stones and be reassured they\u2019re conflict-free. They\u2019re embracing the choice to purchase a piece of fine jewelry that aligns with their values.\u201d Lab-grown diamond brand VRAI said the pandemic, too, has sparked attention and action toward social and environmental issues. It said consumers are being more thoughtful and reassessing their purchasing habits, as well as the companies and industries they are supporting. There is, however, one important consideration for anyone buying lab-created diamonds: Man-made diamonds have little resale value.  So while you may not be able to tell a natural diamond from a factory made variety, someone with a trained eye can, said Golan. Once a stone is identified as a factory diamond, even though you paid a lot less for it, you also won\u2019t get much for it.  But the value of a ring isn\u2019t just monetary. \u201cAs a professional in the industry, I am asked all the time by people about what I think about a ring they have,\u201d said Moran, of Concierge Jewelers. \u201cI always say, if you love it, be happy with it. An engagement ring is a symbol of commitment and enduring love.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/27/business/diamonds-manmade-demand/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_15_business_why-do-small-trader-joes-bags-keep-going-viral", "text": "A few months ago, Thaddeus Yan heard that Trader Joe\u2019s was preparing to sell a fairly mundane new item: A miniature insulated cooler bag. Right away, he was on the lookout. When he went to London on a trip, he even deputized his mom to keep an eye out for the bags. After months of waiting, Yan drove to a Trader Joe\u2019s at 7:30 one morning this month and bought as many as he could, given the store\u2019s purchasing limit: Two in bright teal, and one in hot pink, both with prominent TJ\u2019s branding. Yan, a social media content creator, paid $3.99 for each of the small bags (too tiny for his Stanley cup, he noted in a TikTok video on his \u201cthaddybearz\u201d account \u2014 but big enough for a six pack). Others may not be so lucky. The mini-coolers have already been listed for several times that price on eBay. Yan is part of a throng of influencers who have been changing, and even accelerating, the way certain retail products go viral. They\u2019re not only rushing out to buy as many items as they can, but spreading the word on their popular social channels, where trends catch fire. Before social media, it took a lot more for a niche item to hit. \u201cYou\u2019d have to see people in public settings,\u201d so trends were much more localized, said Colin Campbell, an associate professor of marketing at the University of San Diego\u2019s Knauss business school. But now \u201cyou can have it all happen instantly across the whole country.\u201d Success strikes twice This isn\u2019t even the first time little Trader Joe\u2019s bags have gone viral. In March, shoppers went wild over Trader Joe\u2019s mini canvas tote bags, which rapidly sold out. Most brands don\u2019t see their products take off this way, especially not twice in a row. On those rare occasions, companies make hay: They talk to fans online and build new marketing campaigns, squeezing as much as possible out of that moment in the sun. But Trader Joe doesn\u2019t have much of a social media presence. The company staying (mostly) mum has allowed content creators, particularly on TikTok, to fill the vacuum, making the items \u2014\u00a0which may well have been popular on their own \u2014 even more successful. These creators are playing a key role in the worlds of retail marketing.  Talia Heskett, for example, has more than 134,000 followers on TikTok and about 146,000 on Instagram, plus roughly 68,000 on Facebook for her \u201cTrader Joe\u2019s Talia\u201d accounts, as of Friday. Because Trader Joe\u2019s doesn\u2019t boast much of an official online presence, \u201cI\u2019ve kind of taken on that role\u201d with those pages, she said. Heskett is a fan of the grocery chain, and has turned her interest in the brand into something lucrative. Her channels are popular enough for her to earn payment from TikTok. She\u2019s not the only one posting this type of content. Christy Vetere runs her own TikTok account, \u201cTrader Joe\u2019s and Target Finds,\u201d where she spotlights products from the stores. It had more than 54,000 followers on the social platform on Friday. Heskett, Vetere and others keep shoppers up to date on TJ\u2019s news, tapping into an existing audience of fans to bolster their own followings. What\u2019s up with these bags? Last March, when TJ\u2019s canvas mini totes went viral, the chain appeared baffled by their popularity. \u201cWhat is up with these tote bags? Like, they\u2019re a thing that we didn\u2019t plan for them to be,\u201d said Tara Miller, co-host of the company\u2019s Inside Trader Joe\u2019s podcast, in a March episode. \u201cI\u2019m still a little perplexed about how quickly that excitement went to kind of frenzy,\u201d she said. \u201cWe thought we bought enough of these mini canvas totes to last for several weeks, maybe a whole month,\u201d said Matt Sloan, who hosts the podcast with Miller. \u201cWe had no inkling that they would be this exciting, this quickly, for so many customers. We had actually hundreds of thousands of bags come in and go out within a week.\u201d This time, with the brightly colored coolers, the brand seemed more prepared. \u201cConsider yourself fairly warned: these Totes are totally destined to become the next craze!\u201d screams a product description on the grocery chain\u2019s site.  Apart from the prediction on its website, Trader Joe\u2019s hasn\u2019t said much about the swift-selling seasonal items. A Trader Joe\u2019s representative told CNN that the brand is always looking for new products its customers will like \u2014 and that it plans to offer more of the mini insulated bags this summer. How some products go viral If you search \u201cTrader Joe\u2019s mini insulated bag,\u201d right now you\u2019ll be served a seemingly endless stream of videos featuring the brightly colored items. Some people might just decide to pick one up on their next grocery trip because they saw it online. Others may seek the item out specifically, rushing to stores before they sell out. \u201cWhen you can get something that not everyone else has it makes you look cool, makes you look like an insider,\u201d said Jonah Berger, marketing professor at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School and author of \u201cContagious: Why Things Catch On.\u201d That desire doesn\u2019t only apply to high-priced or extremely rare luxury items, he noted. \u201cYou often see \u2026 trends and things catching on, or going viral, in what I would describe as low-cost public consumables,\u201d Berger said. Think Stanley cups, Owala water bottles and Nike socks \u2014 all items that can be seen in public. These items \u201ccan be affordable luxuries, and can allow people to either show their distinction or show that they\u2019re part of a certain group,\u201d Berger added. For some, the treasure hunt aspect may be part of the fun \u2014\u00a0especially when it ends not only with the coveted item, but a chance to post evidence of success online. Yan, who drove to Trader Joe\u2019s at 7:30 am to find the bags, doesn\u2019t run a Trader Joe\u2019s-focused account like Vetere and Heskett. His videos on Instagram and TikTok are mostly devoted to pop culture and Disney. But he likes the chain, and he likes to post about what he buys there. \u201cYou never know what they\u2019re going to drop, it could be some random, really cool thing that everyone might be interested\u201d in seeing, or getting for themselves, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s always a surprise.\u201d The chain\u2019s unusually loyal fanbase is eager for more Trader Joe\u2019s branded merchandise, TikToker Heskett said, but Trader Joe\u2019s doesn\u2019t offer much of that. \u201cYou can\u2019t buy a Trader Joe\u2019s hat, you can\u2019t buy a Trader Joe\u2019s sweatshirt,\u201d she said. That\u2019s why, she thinks, the branded bags have been such a hit. \u201cPeople want a little piece of Trader Joe\u2019s to carry around with them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/15/business/why-do-small-trader-joes-bags-keep-going-viral/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_17_success_how-to-find-good-affordable-colleges", "text": "Long before you take your high schooler on college campus tours, consider this: Shopping for college shouldn\u2019t be any different than shopping for a home.\u00a0When you want to buy a home, you come up with a range of how much you can afford and get pre-qualified for a mortgage. Then you look in neighborhoods that offer homes that meet your family\u2019s needs and fall within your price range. \u201cAdopt a mindset that we\u2019re buying college like we\u2019re buying a house,\u201d said Beth Walker, author of \u201cBuying College Better\u201d and \u201cNever Pay Retail for College.\u201d As a financial adviser and certified\u00a0college planning specialist, Walker tries to help families avoid a situation that many find themselves in at the 11th hour: Their child applies \u2014 and gets into \u2014 schools they cannot afford because the schools won\u2019t give them enough aid. And then they just \u2026 try to make it work, no matter how much debt is involved for the parents or the student. Instead, she advises families to start as early as 9th or 10th grade in figuring out what is affordable for them as a family \u2014 so parents don\u2019t sacrifice their own financial welfare and the future college student doesn\u2019t drown in debt upon graduation. And second, she recommends assessing how a child\u2019s talents and interests pare with majors and careers they might want to pursue. Doing both those things can help you target the right colleges to apply to. Mike McKinnon, executive director of the National Institute of Certified College Planners, defines the perfect college as one \u201cwhere a student can go be happy, safe and successful, graduate in four years or less with a marketable degree and little or no debt.\u201d In helping families align parents\u2019 affordability constraints with their student\u2019s academic and social needs, he cautions them not to automatically assume the Ivys or other high-prestige schools will be best simply because of their status. And he stresses what success in life looks like after college and notes that an Ivy League degree isn\u2019t the only path to achieving it, especially if your child won\u2019t get much aid to attend. In fact, said Todd Fothergill, founder and CEO of Strategies for College, a lot of brand-name schools don\u2019t even offer merit-based aid, only need-based. So if you\u2019re not rich, but you make too much to qualify for need-based aid, you could find yourself having to cover the entire cost of tuition, room and board every year, which is pushing $90,000 at some US colleges. Set up financial guardrails well before the college search Fothergill created a free calculator called CostHero that lets parents assess what financial resources they will have available to pay for a child\u2019s college education. It then provides a range of affordability: At the low end is the number representing what they can pay if they don\u2019t take on debt. And at the high end is the number they can pay if they also take out an unsubsidized federal Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students (PLUS). \u201cIf you\u2019re not in a position to write a check for $90,000 a year, put up guardrails for yourself so you don\u2019t blow up your retirement,\u201d he said. The calculator inputs let you set the amount of resources you\u2019re willing to use to pay for college from your income and savings, your child\u2019s earnings from summer jobs, any family gifts, and any federal Stafford loans your child may take. It also factors in if you qualify for the federal American Opportunity Tax Credit. That credit, for qualified educational expenses, will reduce your tax bill or increase any refund you have coming. The calculator also gives you a debt-to-income score like the kind a mortgage lender might use to assess whether you\u2019re a good credit risk. Ideally, he said, you don\u2019t want your housing costs to exceed 36% of your gross income and your total debt \u2014 including debt from housing, cars, credit cards and any parental education loans \u2014 to exceed 43%. If your DTI ratio is close to or higher than 43% that is a sign you could get yourself into trouble if you end up having any financial problems while your child is in college, Fothergill said. \u201cIf folks have a way to determine the range of affordability prior to the onset of the college search, the outcomes are a lot better.\u00a0 For example, if one knows that the range of affordability is between $30,000 [a year] with no parent debt and $50,000 with parent debt, then any college that comes in with a net cost in that range is, by definition, affordable,\u201d Fothergill said. Net cost refers to the true cost of attendance after figuring out how much aid your child may get (e.g., grants and scholarships). Figure out where your student may qualify for the most aid Generally speaking, the biggest tuition discounts go to the most academically accomplished students in an incoming class. \u201cThe student needs to be in the top 25% of those admitted,\u201d Walker said. Getting into that top 25% cohort is based on SAT or ACT scores, and having a high, unweighted GPA based on a rigorous high school curriculum. The curriculum\u2019s academic rigor can be further bolstered by taking AP courses. Since your child is more likely to make the top quartile at some schools than others, Fothergill and Walker both recommend your child focus on applying only to those schools in which they stand the best chances of being in that top group to maximize their chances for merit-based aid. Otherwise, you\u2018ll spend money to apply to guidance-counselor-recommended \u201csafety\u201d schools or \u201creach\u201d schools with no sense if those places are affordable to you should your child get in. Using reported data from admissions officers about their key criteria in admitting an incoming class and based on what more than 1,000 schools report about the qualifications they used to grant aid, Fothergill created another tool called ListHero. It gives students a score that helps gauge\u00a0how competitive their profile is\u00a0at a given school, relative to others admitted, and by extension their eligibility for tuition discounts. Right now the tool is only available to college planning professionals for a fee. But Fothergill plans to create a free mini-version for consumers to use. For parents doing their own research on test scores, GPA requirements, costs and aid, he recommends checking the Department of Education College Scorecard, the site CollegeData.com and the College Board. Other ways to reduce college costs before applying While your children are in high school they can take other steps to reduce the total cost of their education. One way is by doing well on the PSAT to qualify to compete for a National Merit Scholarship. Another is to take AP courses. If their high school doesn\u2019t offer them, there is a program called Freshman Year for Free offered by the Modern States Education Alliance. It provides free AP placement courses and pays the fee for students to take the AP tests or college-level preparation (CLEP) tests administered through the College Board. Getting the minimum AP scores a college requires to earn a college credit will lower how much you ultimately have to spend on tuition. A third option is to see if your state has a program that offers a year of free in-state community college, the credits from which can be transferred to a state university from which your child could earn their degree. Or, if you plan to go to any other college, make sure the school will accept the credits from a community college course you plan to take. No matter what steps you take, starting the research and budgeting process early can save everyone a lot of stress, debt and potential heartache in the end. Said Walker: \u201cWe have to be a lot more intentional about this purchase.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/success/how-to-find-good-affordable-colleges/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_17_cars_india-hyundai-ipo-south-korea-intl-hnk", "text": "Hyundai Motor\u2019s India unit sought regulatory approval on Saturday for a stock market listing in Mumbai, which could be the\u00a0nation\u2019s biggest\u00a0and will see the South Korean parent sell a stake of up to 17.5% in the company. The initial public offering (IPO) will make it the country\u2019s first car maker to go public in two decades since Maruti Suzuki in 2003, and would come just as Indian stock markets are trading near record highs. Hyundai counts India as a crucial growth market where it has two manufacturing units and has invested $5 billion, with commitments to pump in another $4 billion over the next decade. The world\u2019s biggest car market after China and the United States is the company\u2019s third-biggest revenue generator globally. The Hyundai draft prospectus filed gave no details of the pricing of the IPO or the company\u2019s valuation, but sources have said Hyundai aims to raise around $2.5 to $3 billion at a valuation of up to $30 billion. Hyundai, India\u2019s second-biggest car maker behind Maruti Suzuki, will not issue new shares in the IPO, which will involve its South Korean parent selling part of its stake in the wholly owned unit to retail and other investors via a so-called \u201coffer for sale\u201d route. The listing is seen putting Hyundai Motor India on a stronger footing versus Maruti Suzuki, Tata Motors and\u00a0other rivals\u00a0as it could make future fundraising easier, without the need to depend on its Korean parent. Hyundai expects the listing of the equity shares in India \u201cwill enhance our visibility and brand image,\u201d and \u201cprovide liquidity and a public market\u201d for the shares, the company said in the draft prospectus filed on Saturday.

{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk", "text": "In a year of wild tech stories that has seen Elon Musk transform Twitter, cryptocurrency exchange FTX collapse and Silicon Valley Bank implode, this week\u2019s whiplash-inducing turmoil at OpenAI is among the most captivating. Sam Altman \u2014 the leader of one of the world\u2019s most influential AI companies, OpenAI, and perhaps the\u00a0most visible figure in the fledgling industry \u2014 was fired Friday night by the startup\u2019s directors in a surprise move. Less than five days later, he\u2019s back as the company\u2019s CEO, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. The series of extraordinary events unfolded just days after OpenAI held its\u00a0first-ever developer conference, where it laid out new, commercialized versions of its technology, including the option to customize its ChatGPT AI chatbot. If you\u2019re just catching up, here\u2019s what you missed from a week so incredible you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking the script could have been written by an early version of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Friday Around 3 p.m. ET, Altman joined a Google Meet call with most of OpenAI\u2019s board that had been convened by fellow co-founder and OpenAI chief scientist\u00a0Ilya Sutskever, during which Altman was fired and told that the news would soon be made public. Within the next half hour, the board also informed Greg Brockman, another co-founder and OpenAI president, that he would be removed from the board. Around 3:30 p.m. ET, OpenAI publicly announced that it had fired Altman over concerns that he was not always truthful with the board. The board said Mira Murati, the company\u2019s chief technology officer, would become interim CEO. OpenAI\u2019s strategic partners, including its biggest financial backer Microsoft, were also reportedly informed of Altman\u2019s ouster just minutes before the board\u2019s announcement. Hours after being fired, Altman posted on X that he \u201cloved working with such talented people\u201d and that he would have \u201cmore to say about what\u2019s next later.\u201d Brockman promptly quit. \u201cPlease don\u2019t spend any time being concerned. We will be fine,\u201d Brockman\u00a0said in a Friday post\u00a0on X. \u201cGreater things coming soon.\u201d A key factor in the CEO\u2019s firing was\u00a0tension between Altman, who favored developing AI\u00a0more aggressively, and members of the OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the unfolding events. Saturday Within 24 hours of Altman being fired, reports emerged that he and other ex-OpenAI loyalists were mulling plans for their own venture. OpenAI\u2019s board was also reportedly having second thoughts and considering asking the ousted CEO to return. Sunday By Sunday afternoon, Altman was\u00a0back at OpenAI\u2019s headquarters\u00a0\u2014 this time with a guest badge \u2014 to negotiate his potential return. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reportedly mediated the discussion. A 5 p.m. PT deadline was reportedly set for the board to agree to Altman\u2019s demands, including adding a seat for Microsoft, and reinstating him as CEO. But those talks broke down. As Sunday turned into Monday, Nadella tweeted that Altman, along with Brockman, would join Microsoft to run a new AI research group. At OpenAI, the group found a new interim CEO: Emmett Shear, the former CEO of Amazon\u2019s streaming service, Twitch. Murati would return to her role as OpenAI\u2019s chief technology officer. Monday In a post on X early Monday, Shear, who left his role at Twitch in March, described the chance to join OpenAI as \u201ca once-in-a-lifetime\u201d opportunity. He added that the company would hire an independent investigator to report on what happened in the lead-up to Altman\u2019s firing. But OpenAI employees were not convinced. More than 500 staffers signed an open letter calling on the company\u2019s board to resign and reinstate Altman and Brockman. They also threatened to follow the co-founders to Microsoft if their demands were not met. Altman posted on X, saying, \u201cwe have more unity and commitment and focus than ever before. we are all going to work together some way or other, and i\u2019m so excited. one team, one mission.\u201d The drama was far from over.\u00a0The Verge reported Monday afternoon\u00a0that Altman and Brockman could still return to OpenAI if the board members who fired him resign. And Nadella, speaking to CNBC, said he was \u201copen to both options\u201d when asked whether Altman would actually join Microsoft. \u201cLook, that is for the OpenAI board and management and the employees to choose,\u201d Nadella said. \u201cWe chose to explicitly partner with OpenAI and we want to continue to do so, and obviously, that depends on the people of OpenAI staying there or coming to Microsoft.\u201d Tuesday Altman\u00a0was reinstated late Tuesday as OpenAI\u2019s CEO, the company said on X. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman\u00a0wrote\u00a0that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his\u00a0post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it has backed with billions to bolster its ambitions in developing AI. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Nadella\u00a0said\u00a0on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_media_nbc-news-ousts-ronna-mcdaniel", "text": "NBC News on Tuesday ousted former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel, just days after her hiring as a paid political analyst sparked intense backlash from the network\u2019s top television anchors over McDaniel\u2019s role in subverting the 2020 election and attacks on the press. \u201cThere is no doubt that the last several days have been difficult for the News Group,\u201d NBCUniversal News Group President Cesar Conde said in a memo to staff. \u201cAfter listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor.\u201d \u201cI want to personally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down,\u201d Conde continued. \u201cWhile this was a collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team, I approved it and take full responsibility for it.\u201d Ahead of the network\u2019s decision, McDaniel spent the day Tuesday interviewing attorneys in preparation for a potential legal battle with NBC, a person familiar with the matter told CNN. Creative Artists Agency, the talent agency that brokered McDaniel\u2019s deal with NBC, also parted ways with her, the person said. The reversal comes after journalists and anchors at both NBC and its cable news sibling MSNBC publicly denounced the decision to hire McDaniel as a paid analyst in a stunning and unprecedented on-air rebuke of network brass that has embarrassed the Peacock Network. McDaniel, who recently stepped down from the RNC under pressure from former President Donald Trump, was involved in attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. As head of the RNC, she was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d In the years since, McDaniel continued to claim that the election had \u201cproblems\u201d and that Biden did not legitimately win the election, fanning the flames of election denialism. NBC\u2019s announcement Friday that it had hired McDaniel was quickly met with alarm by the network\u2019s journalists. The revolt spilled into public view on Sunday when McDaniel appeared on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with moderator Kristen Welker in her first interview since she was hired by the network. Welker disclosed that the interview had been scheduled to take place prior to NBC announcing McDaniel would become a paid contributor for the network, stating that she had no involvement in her hiring. Following the interview, Chuck Todd, NBC News\u2019 chief political analyst, delivered a stinging on-air criticism of NBC executives for their decision to hire McDaniel, telling Welker, \u201cI think our bosses owe you an apology for putting you in this situation.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a reason a lot of journalists at NBC News are uncomfortable with this,\u201d Todd said, explaining that under McDaniel, the RNC engaged in \u201cgaslighting\u201d and \u201ccharacter assassination\u201d when dealing with the news media. The following day, MSNBC hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough joined Todd in protesting the decision on their program \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d \u201cTo be clear, we believe NBC News should seek out conservative Republican voices to provide balance in their election coverage, but it should be conservative Republicans, not a person who used her position of power to be an anti-democracy election denier,\u201d\u00a0Brzezinski said. \u201cWe hope NBC will reconsider its decision. It goes without saying that she will not be a guest on \u2018Morning Joe\u2019 in her capacity as a paid contributor.\u201d Nicolle Wallace, host of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cDeadline: White House,\u201d later joined in the rebuke, saying on her program that the network\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel was nothing short of a potential threat to democracy. \u201cNBC News is, either wittingly or unwittingly, teaching election deniers that what they can do stretches well beyond appearing on our air and interviews to peddle lies about the sanctity and integrity of our elections,\u201d Wallace told viewers. Rachel Maddow \u2014 the network\u2019s biggest star \u2014 later devoted the first half-hour of her prime-time program to the controversy, saying the decision to hire McDaniel was \u201cinexplicable.\u201d Maddow took issue with McDaniel\u2019s long track record of demonizing the news media, labeling the press as \u201cfake news,\u201d and launching ugly attacks on NBC News journalists and MSNBC hosts. \u201cWe do not take it personally when we get attacked, when they say they want to put us on trial and execute us for treason,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so I want to associate myself with all my colleagues at MSNBC and NBC News who have voiced loud and principled objections to our company for putting on the payroll someone who hasn\u2019t just attacked us as journalists, but someone who is part of an ongoing project to get rid of our system of government,\u201d she said of McDaniel. \u201cSomeone who is still trying to convince Americans that this election stuff doesn\u2019t really work. That this last election wasn\u2019t a real result. That American elections are fraudulent.\u201c The on-air revolt ensnared NBC\u2019s top leaders, including NBCUniversal News Group chair Cesar Conde, NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown, who were responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring. MSNBC president Rashida Jones also did not object to the decision, people familiar with the matter said. In the wake of Conde\u2019s announcement to sever ties with McDaniel, MSNBC host Joy Reid and Maddow addressed the reversal on the network\u2019s air, praising the move as \u201cbold\u201d and \u201cstrong.\u201d \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/media/nbc-news-ousts-ronna-mcdaniel/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_20_media_elon-musk-advertisers-cannes-lions", "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:\u00a0A version of this article first appeared in the \u201cReliable Sources\u201d newsletter.\u00a0Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here. Elon Musk\u00a0told advertisers last year to \u201cgo f**k yourself.\u201d This year, he is showcasing a much different attitude. The erratic billionaire, realizing that he very much needs major advertisers to power\u00a0X, was in the South of\u00a0France\u00a0on Wednesday, attending\u00a0Cannes Lions, the world\u2019s largest advertising festival. Sitting for an interview with\u00a0Mark Read, the chief executive of marketing giant\u00a0WPP, Musk was immediately \u2014\u00a0and directly\u00a0\u2014 confronted with his past rhetoric toward the advertising community. \u201cBack in November you had a message to us. You told us to go f**k ourselves, so maybe we start there,\u201d Read said, not mincing any words. \u201cWhy did you say that and what did you mean?\u201d Musk, striking a starkly different tone from when he fumed at the advertising community during his infamous interview with\u00a0Andrew Ross Sorkin, asserted that he hadn\u2019t actually directed his profane remarks toward \u201cadvertisers as a whole.\u201d This time, in what amounted to a tepid walk-back of his previous attitude, Musk agreed that advertisers do indeed \u201chave a right to appear next to content that they find compatible with their brands.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s totally fine,\u201d Musk said, as if that had been his position all along. Setting up a straw man, he then added, \u201cWhat is not cool is insisting that there can be no content they disagree with on the platform.\u201d Of course, major advertisers have never insisted that X \u2014 or any social media company \u2014 ensure that their platforms are entirely free of \u201ccontent they disagree with.\u201d What advertisers have voiced displeasure with is when their paid marketing is placed directly next to hate speech or other forms of toxic content, which X has\u00a0repeatedly\u00a0done. But perhaps more discouraging to the advertising community had been Musk\u2019s own unhinged behavior. The\u00a0SpaceX\u00a0and\u00a0Tesla\u00a0boss has gleefully promoted conspiracy theories, used his perch as the most-followed X account to launch ugly attacks on critics, smeared the news media, worked to stifle free speech that inconveniences him, and elevated political extremists on the platform, among other offensive actions. Last year, in the wake of the October 7 terrorist attack in Israel, Musk casually endorsed an antisemitic conspiracy theory, only apologizing days later after coming under immense pressure. Put together, it\u2019s is no mystery why major brands have taken their advertising dollars elsewhere. Not only has X proven to be an unsafe advertising environment for their brands, but the leader of the company himself has engaged in the very toxic behavior they don\u2019t want their companies associated with. Which is why brands fled X in droves last year, dealing a devastating blow to the company\u2019s business, which had been largely fueled by advertising. Musk even said at the time that the damage to X\u2019s bottom line was so great, it could eventually kill the company. Musk likely does not want to see the platform go the way of the woolly mammoth, which is why he is now trying to woo advertisers back. The trouble for the mercurial mogul is that, despite his ability to sometimes say the correct words at events such as Cannes Lions, the real Musk is not brand safe \u2014 and neither is his platform. In just the last month, Musk has blasted the\u00a0Associated Press\u00a0as a supposed \u201cfar left propaganda machine,\u201d claimed \u201cthe left has become an extinctionist movement,\u201d advanced a version of the\u00a0Great Replacement Theory\u00a0by arguing that\u00a0President Joe Biden\u2019s\u00a0administration is engaged in \u201cvoter importation\u201d from Mexico, assailed\u00a0The Washington Post\u00a0as a \u201cfar left propaganda publication,\u201d promoted the notion that the\u00a0Democratic Party\u00a0is engaged in \u201clawfare\u201d against Republicans, contended that the conviction of\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0was \u201cabuse of the law for political purposes,\u201d and endorsed the notion that diversity and equity programs are making science dangerous, among other things. That is not the type of rhetoric blue chip companies want their carefully curated brands anywhere near. And until Musk\u2019s actions on X start to match the calculated show he puts on for advertisers when trying to win over their business, it is hard to see major brands returning en masse to his platform.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/media/elon-musk-advertisers-cannes-lions/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_27_media_nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over", "text": "Only 80 hours elapsed between NBC News announcing Ronna McDaniel as a paid contributor and the network ousting her from that very role. But for the leadership at NBC Universal News Group, those were 80\u00a0painful hours. On Tuesday evening, following another full day in which the media rumor mill churned at warp speed, NBCU News Group boss Cesar Conde sent staff a memo, notifying his troops that he had reversed his decision to welcome the former Republican National Committee chair to \u201cthe team.\u201d \u201cAfter listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor,\u201d Conde said, adding that he wanted to \u201cpersonally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down.\u201d Conde had no real choice. The embattled NBCU boss, who I\u2019m told dealt with the crisis from an unknown location outside of 30 Rock, was facing an unprecedented rebellion from his most high-profile stars, who one by one went on the air and excoriated leadership\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel. The only aspect of Conde\u2019s note that was surprising was the fact that it came 48 hours late, allowing what started off as a crisis to fester and balloon into one of the worst corporate public relations calamities in recent memory. \u201cWhat a sh*t show!\u201d a media executive exclaimed to me Tuesday shortly after Conde relieved McDaniel of her NBC News credentials. In his note, Conde said he took \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for McDaniel\u2019s hire. But, he also did point the finger, telling staffers that hiring her was \u201ca collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team.\u201d Indeed, multiple people familiar with the matter have told me that the infighting among NBC executives over who was at fault for the disaster has reached a fever pitch, with various factions of the NBCU News Group assigning blame to others. Regardless of who is to blame, the entire affair made clear who is actually in control of the company \u2014 and it\u2019s not Conde & Co. Despite the NBCU C-suite digging their heels in the sand as they resisted dumping McDaniel for days, they were ultimately forced to succumb to pressure from their talent. As a second media executive commented to me, it is now \u201cvery clear who is in charge\u201d after the \u201cweak leadership was put on full display.\u201d \u201cHas Cesar lost the room?\u201d wondered a third media executive. While the Peacock family argues over who was really at fault, the company is facing a fresh public relations mess. Led by Donald Trump, right-wing personalities are already assailing the network as being overrun with intolerant woke leftists. \u201cThese Radical Left Lunatics are CRAZY and the top people at NBC ARE WEAK,\u201d Trump raged on his Truth Social platform. Ari Fleischer, who served as press secretary under President George W. Bush, wrote on X: \u201cWhat NBC is saying is if you\u2019re for Trump, you don\u2019t belong. Good. Let NBC be for Democrats only.\u201d Of course, that narrative is intellectually dishonest. The objection to McDaniel from both within and outside of NBCU was not that she is a Republican. It wasn\u2019t even that she was a Trump-supporting Republican. No, the objection stemmed from the fact that McDaniel was an active participant in the plot to subvert the 2020 vote. And, in addition to that disgraceful history, she had a lengthy track record smearing NBC News and MSNBC. Nevertheless, NBCU will now have to contend with such dishonest attacks being leveled by the right, which will follow them in the days, months, and even years to come. As unfair as it may be, they will certainly damage the network\u2019s brand in Republican circles \u2014 a place it had gone through great pains to appeal to. NBCU will also have to grapple with McDaniel, who spent the last 24 hours or so interviewing lawyers as she gears up for a possible legal fight with the network, according to a person familiar with the matter. The rift between McDaniel and NBCU had grown to such an extent by Tuesday that she was not informed by network brass that she had been dismissed, I\u2019m told. Instead, McDaniel learned of her ouster in press reports. While NBCU is being beaten up on the right, the company\u2019s leadership was quickly praised by its journalists and top stars. Shortly after Conde sent out his memo, Rachel Maddow appeared on Joy Reid\u2019s show, where the two lauded Conde for reversing course. \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/27/media/nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_judges-stern-rebuke-of-elon-musks-x-gives-researchers-fresh-hope", "text": "A federal judge\u2019s decision this week reprimanding Elon Musk\u2019s X will have reverberating effects on efforts to hold influential online platforms accountable, legal experts and advocacy groups say. On Monday, District Judge Charles Breyer dismissed and excoriated a lawsuit by X against online watchdog group Center for Countering Digital Hate as an attempt to silence the non-profit group for sounding alarms about hate speech on the platform. Breyer wrote in Monday\u2019s order that the lawsuit was \u201cunabashedly\u201d about \u201cpunishing\u201d reports written by CCDH, which X had accused of campaigning to drive away its advertisers. Breyer held that the reports were \u201cunquestionably\u201d protected by the group\u2019s free speech rights. Now, that decision could embolden other research groups and Musk critics who have faced legal threats from the billionaire. The CCDH case \u2014 in the US District Court for the Northern District of California \u2014\u00a0has been widely viewed as a bellwether for research and accountability on X, where Musk has restored the accounts of previously banned White supremacists and spreaders of misinformation and where Musk himself has amplified various conspiracy theories. And CCDH is not the only organization that has faced attacks by self-proclaimed \u201cfree speech absolutist\u201d Musk after criticizing or raising concerns about his platform. \u201cThis is an important decision that sees Elon Musk\u2019s lawsuit for what it is \u2014 an effort to punish his critics for constitutionally protected speech and to deter researchers from studying his platform,\u201d said Alex Abdo, litigation director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, which had filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the case arguing that private companies should not be allowed to use breach of contract claims to punish criticism. \u201cSociety needs reliable and ethical research into social media platforms, and often that research relies on being able to study publicly available posts,\u201d Abdo said. X said it plans to appeal Breyer\u2019s decision. Musk\u2019s threats against X critics In his first year as owner of X, formerly known as Twitter, Musk threatened legal action against the Anti-Defamation League for defamation, as well as against Microsoft and Meta for allegedly improper data and trade secret access, respectively. None of those threats ever amounted to real lawsuits. He did, however, sue the progressive media watchdog Media Matters over its\u00a0analysis\u00a0highlighting antisemitic and pro-Nazi content on X, alleging that the group\u2019s testing methodology was not representative of how real users experience the site and that the report was designed to drive away advertisers. Legal experts have described that case as \u201cweak\u201d on the merits and as a \u201cbogus\u201d attempt to chill criticism of X. This week\u2019s court decision may be only a temporary setback in Musk\u2019s wider plan to stifle criticism, said Media Matters CEO Angelo Carusone. Musk\u2019s new playbook, Carusone said, enlists the help of sympathetic Republican attorneys general to investigate independent reporting organizations and tie them up in legal proceedings. The states of Texas and Missouri each announced probes into Media Matters following X\u2019s lawsuit against the group, to which Musk responded, \u201cGreat!\u201d As recently as Monday, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey filed a petition in state court seeking to compel Media Matters\u2019 cooperation with his investigation. The filing came a week after he appeared with Musk in a live event on X \u2014 which Carusone said shows how Musk hopes to deputize the power of government to silence his critics. \u201cThey have every reason to do it,\u201d Carusone said of the AGs\u2019 investigations. \u201cThey get the political benefits, they get the attention. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any cost to them yet. And if they are successful at developing this new playbook, this new terrain, legally, then it\u2019s going to pave the way for them to just use this tool and tactic over and over and over again.\u201d A representative for X did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Carusone\u2019s claims. Researchers face hurdles to studying on-platform behavior Researchers from non-profits and academic institutions have had a harder time studying X since Musk\u2019s takeover in 2022. Academics need large samples of posts, shares, likes and other data to study social media trends in mis- and disinformation, public health, elections and other key topics. But one of Musk\u2019s first changes at X was to put access to platform data behind a steep paywall. Researchers and civil society groups said the new subscription fees \u2014 costing up to $2.5 million a year \u2014\u00a0were \u201coutrageously expensive\u201d and made it impossible to do their work, reducing transparency of a critical platform. The change may have forced some researchers to rely more heavily on first-person observational data to draw conclusions about user behavior on X. Groups like CCDH have also used automated \u201cscraping\u201d of publicly viewable content from X rather than paying the company for data directly, a tactic that helped give rise to X\u2019s initial lawsuit. Efforts by X and other social media companies to limit research transparency makes them less accountable to the public at best and, at worst, could mask malicious behavior, said David Karpf, an associate professor in the School of Media and Public Affairs at George Washington University. \u201cWe need independent research to have any real measure of what\u2019s going on at X/Twitter. Musk is only ever going to release data that makes his company look good,\u201d Karpf said. \u201cThese platforms are too big and too vital to the spread of information to be left unmonitored.\u201d \u201cThis is an election year,\u201d Karpf added, \u201cand the platforms are taking steps to make it harder to monitor how their services are used for malignant ends.\u201d Free Press, another media accountability organization that has been critical of Musk\u2019s leadership of X and which called for advertisers to pause their spending on the platform shortly after his takeover, also celebrated Breyer\u2019s ruling as potentially removing at least one hurdle that watchdog organizations face. \u201cThe guardrails for democracy are hanging by a thread and we have dwindling insights into platform practices as researchers face lawsuits, congressional subpoenas and other scare tactics,\u201d said Nora Benavidez, senior counsel and director of digital rights at Free Press. Ultimately, Benavidez called the ruling \u201ca reminder that platform accountability is essential and will inevitably prevail when up against bullies like Musk who try to silence us.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/judges-stern-rebuke-of-elon-musks-x-gives-researchers-fresh-hope/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2022_04_25_business_electric-hybrid-corvette", "text": "General Motors will produce a fully electric Chevrolet Corvette, GM President Mark Reuss announced in a LinkedIn post Monday morning.  Reuss didn\u2019t say when the electric Corvette would come, but he hinted that a hybrid model could come relatively soon. \u201cWe will offer an electrified Corvette as early as next year,\u201d he wrote. An accompanying video the company posted to Twitter showed what appeared to be a hybrid Corvette, and in another first, showed the front wheels spinning and throwing snow as if being powered. All Corvettes produced by the company previously have been rear-wheel-drive only. While Reuss\u2019s post implies a hybrid Corvette will be based on the current generation of the car, it\u2019s not clear if the all-electric version will be a variation of this car or a completely different future model. \u201cElectrified\u201d is an auto industry term encompassing everything from hybrid to fully electric vehicles, and anything with an electric motor can count as \u201celectrified.\u201d It has long been rumored that the current generation of the Corvette, the first with its gasoline engine mounted behind the seats instead of in the front, could be built with a hybrid system. Reuss has also previously hinted there would be electrified variants of the car. Various companies are working on electric sports cars. Most all-electric vehicles in production so far have been four-door sedans and SUVs, as the need for batteries lends itself to larger and heavier vehicles. Tesla\u2019s first car, the Lotus Elise-based Tesla Roadster, was an electric sports car, but the second-generation of Tesla Roadster, originally unveiled as a prototype in 2017, has yet to go into production. Some manufacturers, such as Lamborghini, have said that current battery technology doesn\u2019t allow for a optimum sports car performance from a purely electric vehicle. Lamborghini has been working on plug-in hybrid sports cars, though. To date, the Corvette is only available in the base Stingray version with 6.2-liter V8 engine producing up to 495 horsepower. A 670 horsepower Corvette Z06 with a 5.5-liter V8 was unveiled last fall. The previous generation of the Corvette included included a 755-horsepower ZR1 version. Nothing like that has yet been announced for the current model but GM engineers have said a major reason for putting the engine in the back was to allow for better performance at extremely high horsepower levels. Besides saving gas, hybrid systems can also be used in high-performance cars to add additional power and to provide for quicker acceleration since electric motors can provide power to the wheels more quickly than gas engines. Ferrari\u2019s most powerful sports cars are hybrids, for instance.   GM has said it plans to produce only zero-emission vehicles, meaning fully electric or powered by hydrogen fuel cells, by 2035.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/25/business/electric-hybrid-corvette/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_16_food_fudgie-the-whale-carvel-history", "text": "Whiskey, steaks and ties are all typical gifts for Father\u2019s Day, but one specifically made for the holiday takes the cake: Fudgie the Whale. Carvel\u2019s vanilla and chocolate-flavored ice cream cake has been a holiday staple since 1977, when it it was first created as a Father\u2019s Day promotion, and nearly five decades later, it has earned its place in the pantheon of recognizable fast food characters. Fudgie the Whale wasn\u2019t initially produced to be a mascot for the 90-year-old brand. It was made to fill the freezer cases that founder Tom Carvel had made for his shops. Ice cream cakes quickly flew off the shelves, first created in the mid-1950s, and twenty years later he thought of making a cake for Father\u2019s Day. Fudgie was a play on the phrase (more commonly said back then): a \u201cwhale of a dad,\u201d according to Carvel\u2019s Chief Brand Officer Jim Salerno, which prompted Carvel to mass produce Fudgie using a plastic, whale-shaped mold that he invented. He decided to top it with fudge, because it was one of Carvel\u2019s most popular toppings. To make the cake, soft-serve vanilla is placed into the mold first, followed by chocolate chip cookie pieces better known as \u201ccrunchies.\u201d Then it\u2019s topped with soft-serve chocolate ice cream and frozen for several hours. After that, it\u2019s topped with hot fudge with more crunchies on the side. The cakes sell for about $30. Fudgie helped Father\u2019s Day become Carvel\u2019s busiest day of the year for buying cakes, Salerno said. \u201cThe simple reason is when you ask dad what they want to do on Father\u2019s Day is that they want to stay home, like watch TV or have a barbecue. It\u2019s a big holiday to bring cake home,\u201d Salerno told CNN. Fudgie\u2019s popularity extends beyond Father\u2019s Day, Salerno said, popular for other occasions like birthdays and anniversaries, too. Carvel sells nearly 100,000 Fudgies a year. Fudgie is also part of fading piece of fast food culture, as mascots have largely become a thing of the past. They have been \u201csuccessful in reaching kids and families with a memorable character that could then recreate some nostalgia and a fondness for the food and the memories of that chain,\u201d said David Henkes, a senior principal at Technomic, a food industry research and consulting firm. Carvel could use a boost. Its footprint has deceased in recent years and sales lag behind its competitors like Dairy Queen and Baskin Robbins, according to the firm\u2019s data. Carvel is owned by privately held Go To Foods (f.k.a. Focus Brands) that also has Auntie Anne\u2019s, Jamba and Cinnabon in its portfolio. \u201cFor Carvel, Fudgie the Whale cakes evoke those same memories and nostalgia for consumers those that are from the East Coast, and for a relatively small regional chain Fudgie has worked its way into pop culture and probably helps keep Carvel more top of mind for consumers,\u201d he told CNN. Sibling rivalry Although Fudgie is Carvel\u2019s most famous treat, it has a little known sibling rivalry with Cookie Puss \u2014 a goofy looking alien with a sugar cone as a nose. That was actually Carvel\u2019s first shaped cake, created about five years before Fudgie, to complement the chain\u2019s ice cream sandwiches, known as Flying Saucers. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be an extra-terrestrial, but some people say that they kind of fashioned it to look like Tom because it has a nice big nose, big eyes and big ears,\u201d Salerno teased. \u201cBut when Fudgie came along, Fudgie surpassed Cookie Puss very quickly.\u201d Cookie Puss remains on sale, as well as other shaped cakes like ice cream cones, bunny rabbits for Easter and various sports-themed cakes, like basketball and baseball. Fudgie\u2019s mold has dual purpose to, Salerno said noting that the late Tom Carvel (he died in 1990) \u201cwas very frugal\u201d and turned it sideways to make a Santa Claus cake, which has been on sale for about four decades. The Fudgie family expanded this year with the introduction of Fudgie Pops, which are mini Fudgie cake pops on a stick. Later this year, Carvel is introducing another new character cake, but Salerno is keeping mum on the shape. Fudgie fandom Carvel has about 340 locations, with more than half of them in New York, but Fudgie\u2019s fandom extends beyond the state. It\u2019s been lovingly joked about on several TV shows including Family Guy, The Office and even The Simpsons. Last October, Kelly Ripa, a big Carvel fan, received a Fudgie cake on her nationally syndicated talk show \u201cLive with Kelly and Mark\u201d for her 53rd birthday. Fudgie is hard to escape: Fudgie mascot has made appearances at New York Mets\u2019 and Yankees games, he\u2019s appeared in TV commercials and was even made into Fudgie the Beer in 2018 as part of a limited-time promotion. For Carvel, which is celebrating its 90th year this year with a new logo and refreshed store designs to focus on its soft serve ice cream roots (Carvel claims that its founder has invented that, but others might disagree), Fudgie sparks nostalgia for consumers. \u201cWe as a brand made sure to keep him front and center,\u201d Salerno said. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how well-known and how well loved he is.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/16/food/fudgie-the-whale-carvel-history/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "business"}}

Americans tend to shell out in the summer as they venture outdoors, book trips and step away from their desks. This year, warm weather might not be enough to get consumers to open up their wallets. Consumers plan to spend less on away-from-home entertainment and vacations this summer, according to the 2024 KPMG Consumer Pulse Survey released Tuesday. That\u2019s a contrast to last year when Americans shelled out on the \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d phenomenon, Taylor Swift and Beyonc\u00e9 concert tickets and getaways. Americans expect to reduce their monthly spending on dining out by 9% on average, by 8% for entertainment and media and by 7% on travel and vacations. It\u2019s not just discretionary spending that could take a hit. Just 21% of consumers plan to spend more on personal care products, a drop from 32% last year, according to the survey. \u201cConsumers are tightening their belts another notch as they hunt for discounts, and even some essentials are being impacted,\u201d said Duleep Rodrigo, KPMG\u2019s US consumer and retail sector leader, in a release. While some companies have simply raised their prices to account for higher inflation, others have reduced the size of products like cleaning products, coffee and candies instead so that the price tag remains the same, though they are more expensive by unit. Both tactics have drawn criticism from consumers. And there are signs that shoppers are becoming fatigued. Sales at US retailers rose just 0.1% in May from the month before, according to a report from the Commerce Department released Tuesday. That was above April\u2019s downwardly revised 0.2% but short of FactSet consensus estimates of a 0.3% gain. Slowing consumer spending should help cool the economy and help the Federal Reserve cut interest rates sooner rather than later, as long as inflation also edges closer to the central bank\u2019s 2% goal. But a sharp, unexpected decline in spending, which accounts for the vast majority of economic output, would likely mean that the broader economy is in recession territory. Customers are also searching for more than just the cheapest prices \u2014 they want quality, long-lasting products, even if it means they have to pay a little bit more. Retailers that offer Americans more bang for their buck including Ross Stores, TJ Maxx and HomeGoods-parent TJX, Dollar General and Walmart have benefitted. But companies like Abercrombie & Fitch and Williams-Sonoma, which have loftier price tags than discount stores but are known for carrying high-quality products, are also seeing strong sales. Americans are also feeling worse about the economy as they struggle with elevated inflation and high borrowing rates. The University of Michigan\u2019s reading of consumer sentiment for early June showed that Americans\u2019 attitudes about the economy was around the same levels as May, which saw a roughly 10% decline after three straight months of little change. Relief could come later this year for consumers. Cool May inflation data has led investors to raise their bets that the Federal Reserve will cut rates this year. The Fed at its June policy meeting penciled in one cut this year and four in 2025. Millionaires are fleeing Britain in their thousands \u00a0A record number of millionaires could leave the United Kingdom this year as political turmoil and the potential for higher taxes under a future Labour government reduce the appeal of what was once among the top destinations for the rich, reports my colleague Mark Thompson. As many as 9,500 people with at least $1 million in liquid, investable assets, will leave the country, more than double the number that left in 2023, according to provisional estimates contained in a report Tuesday by migration advisers Henley & Partners. \u201cThese figures reflect a steady accumulation of factors detracting from the UK\u2019s appeal to high-net-worth individuals,\u201d Hannah White, CEO of the Institute for Government, wrote in the report. \u201cThe hangover from Brexit continues to be felt, with the City of London no longer seen as the financial center of the world.\u201d The report is based on data on 150,000 high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) tracked by investment firm New World Wealth. The firm only counts people who stay in their new country more than half of the year, and focuses primarily on company founders, chairs, CEOs, presidents, directors and managing partners. The continuing exodus from the UK \u2014 16,500 millionaires left between 2017 and 2023 \u2014 is part of a global mass migration of the rich that appears to be accelerating. The Henley Private Wealth Migration report found that 128,000 millionaires are set to relocate this year, beating last year\u2019s record by 8,000. Read more here. Nvidia surpasses Microsoft to become the largest public company in the world Nvidia, Wall Street\u2019s artificial intelligence poster child, is now the most valuable company in the world, taking the crown from Microsoft.

Apple is the third most valuable company in the US with a $3.27 trillion market cap. Nvidia shares closed 3.5% higher on Tuesday. Microsoft shares fell 0.5% and Apple shares lost 1.1%. Nvidia earlier this month joined the tech giants in becoming the only US companies to cross a $3 trillion market cap. The chipmaker\u2019s stock has been on a tear for the last year and a half.

{"id": "2024_06_20_investing_nvidia-most-valuable-company-explained", "text": "It\u2019s easy to grasp why Apple, Microsoft and Google are multitrillion-dollar companies: Just think about how many people around the world interact with the companies\u2019 products and rely on them to go about their daily lives. But these multigenerational brand names are now trailing behind Nvidia, suddenly the most valuable public company in the world. The tech behemoth, whose launch into AI chipmaking sent its stock into the stratosphere is hardly a household name. Many people can\u2019t even pronounce it (it\u2019s en-VID-eeyah, the company says on its website). It\u2019s derived from the Latin word \u201cinvidia,\u201d meaning envy, something many companies are undoubtedly feeling these days. \u201cI just read that it is now the world\u2019s most valuable company, surpassing Microsoft. Why is that, because what does it do?\u201d one user posted on Reddit on Tuesday. Many Nvidia investors who hopped on the train likely can\u2019t explain what it does either. With a market value of over $3 trillion, Nvidia is worth more than most countries\u2019 entire economies. How did Nvidia get there? Video games were just the start Artificial intelligence wasn\u2019t on the minds of Nvidia\u2019s founders when they launched the company 31 years ago over a meal at Denny\u2019s, where its CEO Jensen Huang worked at one point as a dishwasher. Their discussion revolved around finding a way to boost the processing capabilities of computers, especially graphics-intensive applications, Huang said in a recent interview that aired on CBS News\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d That was the impetus for Nvidia entering the graphics processing unit, or GPU, space in 1999. (While Nvidia popularized the term, it didn\u2019t invent it, though it is often mistakenly credited with having done so.) Nvidia\u2019s GPUs revolutionized the gaming industry, bringing to market new games with movie-like visuals, whereas prior games were 2-D. Eventually, the company took things one step further, creating a programming language that enabled developers to create applications to run on its hardware. By 2012, it discovered that its chips could be used to power much, much more than video games. Chief among those: artificial intelligence applications. Still, the company remained relatively obscure to most investors and consumers \u2014 except for hardcore PC gamers. That all changed in November 2022, when OpenAI announced ChatGPT, permanently altering people\u2019s understanding of AI\u2019s capabilities. The app\u2019s stunning ability to mimic human speech and perform complex tasks shook Silicon Valley and Wall Street. The winning ingredient (for now) Suppose everyone collectively at the same time decided they don\u2019t want to commute to work by driving or using mass transit. Instead, everyone is going to bike to work from here on out. Well, naturally demand for bikes is going to explode overnight. Want to get in on the action and start making bikes? You\u2019re going to need a lot of steel. Nvidia is the steel of AI. Now that just about every company, tech or not, is trying to find some way to use AI after OpenAI\u2019s success made them look silly in comparison, everyone needs a lot of Nvidia. It\u2019s no wonder why it was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 in 2023, gaining a whopping 239%. Up an additional 181% so far this year, it\u2019s been the best-performing again. All that demand for Nvidia chips surely must\u2019ve increased competition, right? Slowly but surely it has, with heavyweights like Meta, Amazon, IBM and Microsoft starting to play catchup. However, no company is close to Nvidia\u2019s capabilities in the AI space, which is why it controls upwards of 70% of the market in AI chips. Wall Street\u2019s love affair with AI doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019ll ever end. Could it all be one big bubble that\u2019s bound to burst like the dot-com era? Maybe, but it seems less likely given the intrinsic value AI carries. All that means is demand for Nvidia chips isn\u2019t going away any time soon \u2014 but competition will continue to grow more fierce. And before we know it, another company with a name most people can\u2019t pronounce will be referred to as the next Nvidia.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/investing/nvidia-most-valuable-company-explained/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_20_business_red-sea-vessel-sunk-shipping-warning", "text": "Leading shipping groups have urged governments \u201cwith influence\u201d to put a stop to Houthi attacks on vessels in the Red Sea after a second freighter sank this week. At least three seafarers have been killed in the attacks so far. The latest sinking is likely to have led to another death, according to a statement Wednesday from more than a dozen shipping associations, including the International Chamber of Shipping and the World Shipping Council. Their call for action highlights the growing human toll from the disruption to one of the world\u2019s trade arteries which has been virtually closed to container ships since late last year. The longer diversion around the southern tip of Africa has sent shipping costs soaring and is causing congestion at ports in Asia and Europe, threatening to scramble global supply chains. \u201cIt is deplorable that innocent seafarers are being attacked while simply performing their jobs, vital jobs which keep the world warm, fed, and clothed,\u201d the shipping associations said in their statement. \u201cThis is an unacceptable situation, and these attacks must stop now. We call for states with influence in the region to safeguard our innocent seafarers and for the swift de-escalation of the situation in the Red Sea,\u201d they added. The statement was released the same day that UK Maritime Trade Operations, part of the Royal Navy, confirmed that a Greek-owned coal carrier had sunk after being struck by the Houthis last week. According to the shipping groups, one seafarer on board the vessel, called the MV Tutor, \u201cseems certain to have been killed.\u201d \u201cThis is the second fatal attack in which our seafarers have been caught in the crosshairs of geopolitical conflicts,\u201d they said in their statement. The MV Tutor is also the second ship sunk by the Houthis. A British-registered vessel, Rubymar, was downed in March after being struck by ballistic missiles fired from Yemen. The Iranian-aligned Houthi rebels, based in Yemen, started launching drone and missile strikes on vessels in the Red Sea in November in what they say is revenge against Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. They have since also seized one vessel and its crew, who are still being held hostage. Shipping costs keep rising Beyond the loss of life, the Houthi attacks have also caused severe disruption to transit through the Red Sea, which connects with the Suez Canal, a vital thoroughfare that accounts for 10-15% of world trade. Major container shipping companies, including Maersk and Hapag Lloyd, have been sending their vessels on the much longer route around the southern tip of Africa. Freight rates have surged as a result. In the week to Thursday, the composite cost of shipping a typical 40-foot container on eight major East-West routes hit $5,117, up 233% from a year ago, according to London-based shipping consultancy Drewry. Carriers have also tacked on emergency surcharges to account for the disruption. Last month, Maersk temporarily increased some of these additional charges. \u201cThe complexity of the situation in Red Sea and the ripple effects on global supply chains have intensified in recent months,\u201d the Danish company said in a statement at the time. \u201cWe continue to face additional challenges and costs,\u201d it added, citing \u201coperational bottlenecks.\u201d According to logistics firm Freightos, the forced diversions are causing congestion at ports in Singapore, Malaysia, Shanghai in China and Barcelona in Spain, leading to delays and cancellations of sailings as vessels miss their scheduled departures. The recent increase in delays and shipping costs may also be putting pressure on companies to move seasonal goods now before rates climb further or to avoid delays later in the year, which could mean shortages during the peak shopping season, Freightos\u2019s head of research Judah Levine wrote in a note Tuesday. \u201cHouthi attacks continue to make the Red Sea unsafe, and increases in charter activity and rates indicate carriers expect congestion to remain a factor for some time,\u201d he added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/business/red-sea-vessel-sunk-shipping-warning/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit", "text": "When Apple launched its first Mac computer in 1984, with its iconic Mac smiley-face \u201chello\u201d greeting, it wanted to differentiate itself in the fledgling PC market. The Mac was approachable with its friendly, innovative design \u2013 Apple\u2019s way of setting the Mac apart in the confusing PC landscape. That consumer-friendly mantra still exists today, with Apple carefully curating an easy-breezy yet controlled user experience across its products, including the billions of iPhones used around the world. But the Biden administration believes Apple took that too far. On Thursday, the Department of Justice sued Apple for illegally monopolizing the smartphone market. In a press conference, the government provided a long list of how Apple has allegedly squashed competition with restrictive app store terms, high fees and its \u201cwalled-garden\u201d approach, restricting how third-party companies interact with its brands and services. The company denied the lawsuit\u2019s allegations and said it plans to fight them. Apple added that the lawsuit could empower the government \u201cto take a heavy hand in designing people\u2019s technology.\u201d But if successful, the lawsuit could ripple across Apple\u2019s products and services. Although the suit could take years to play out, here\u2019s a closer look what it may eventually mean for iPhone users: Changes to the App Store If found liable, the company could be forced to change a number of things. One such change is how iPhone users could get greater access to \u201csuper apps\u201d that have been largely restricted before. The term refers to one-stop-shop apps that allow for messaging, ordering food, payment processing and other capabilities all within one platform.  According to Dipanjan Chatterjee, a principal analyst at market research firm Forrester, super apps most threaten Apple\u2019s preeminence in the lives of its customers. \u201cAn offering like WeChat, dubbed China\u2019s everything app, can provide an alternative to the Apple ecosystem for people to communicate, bank, share memories, talk to businesses and more,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cWhat Apple fears most is becoming irrelevant to its customers.\u201d At the same time, super apps like WeChat are created by larger companies and could, therefore, put some smaller companies at a disadvantage. And the concept hasn\u2019t been welcomed much in the US anyway. The US government, however, could argue that lack of interest may be due to Apple\u2019s high share of the smartphone market and its resistance to offer super apps in its store, Chatterjee said. Better interoperability Apple may also be required to offer more support for cross-platform messaging, an issue the company previously said it\u2019s already working on. The company lets iPhone users send high-quality photos and videos to one another, but similar texts to Android phones are slower and grainy. It also maintains those messages in green bubbles, creating a kind of class divide, critics argue. In November, the company said it will add new features, such as read receipts, typing indicators, better support for group chats and higher quality media sharing of images and videos, across platforms to help close the gap. Apple\u2019s move to add support for the standard called RCS (rich communication services) is intended to roll out later this year. RCS is considered the replacement to alternatives such as SMS, or short messaging service, and can work over both Wi-Fi and mobile data. The change followed pressure from both regulators and competitors to more seamlessly work across operating systems. The European Union\u2019s Digital Markets Act, for example, requires companies to make their key services interoperable between platforms. The US government could require the same. More open services Another likely change is how hardware from other companies, such as smartwatches, will interact with the Apple range of devices and software, including the iPhone and Apple\u2019s services like Fitness+. The company has also required Apple Watch users to own iOS devices as a way to keep them locked into its existing ecosystem. Chatterjee said making this change would have both positives and negatives. \u201cThe net result would reside somewhere along the spectrum of access to more and cheaper options but also the devaluation of the customer experience that is so highly prized by Apple\u2019s customers,\u201d he said. The Biden administration has also taken issue with Apple\u2019s lack of support for mobile cloud services. Loosening this could allow users to access games and other cloud-based apps without having to pay for pricey hardware. Inside the debate The DOJ lawsuit claims Apple\u2019s behavior has illegally hindered competition, kept its customers locked into its products and prevented other companies from innovating. Although the Biden administration will have to prove these harms, some critics say any potential changes Apple could make will negatively impact the user experience. David McQueen, a research director at ABI Research, said he recognizes that the content and applications market should be open, and Apple needs to avoid monopolistic advantages that can restrict competition, push up prices or block innovation. But Apple\u2019s success stems in part to its tight grip on its products and services, keeping things intuitive and seamless. \u201cIf Apple is forced to comply, it could potentially spell the end to the provision of this consistent and unified user experience, although by the same token, consumers will be open to a greater choice of apps and services, helping more developers and providers,\u201d McQueen said. Chatterjee noted some people are drawn to the Apple family of products precisely because of the carefully managed ecosystem\u2019s ease of use. Apple may have to work that much harder to preserve the integrity of its experience, but any changes probably won\u2019t be enough to make customers to leave and go elsewhere. \u201cThe vast majority of Apple customers would probably be happier with some more choice and lower prices as long as it did not hamper their levels of customer experience, which is threatened by the less control Apple has over the experience,\u201d Chatterjee said. But he added those currently outside of the Apple ecosystem will likely benefit by \u201cplugging in opportunistically without having to go all in with Apple.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_12_success_equal-pay-day-2024", "text": "March 12 marks Equal Pay Day in the United States, a symbolic date representing the number of days women have to work into the current year just to make the same amount of money men made in the prior one. Put another way, to make 12 months\u2019 worth of a man\u2019s median wages, a woman has to work about 14.5 months. In dollars and cents, for every dollar a man earns, a woman is paid 84 cents, according to the National Committee on Pay Equity and the Equal Pay Today campaign. That\u2019s based on earnings data for full-time, year-round workers from the US Census in 2022, which was the most recent full-year data set available. If part-time workers and those not employed year-round are included, the gender pay gap is worse, at 78 cents on the dollar, said Deborah Vagins, national campaign director of Equal Rights Advocates and director of Equal Pay Today. The size of the actual wage gap between men and women will widen or narrow depending on age, level of education, choice of occupation and tenure, as well as race and ethnicity. The gender pay gap is typically widest when comparing the earnings of White men to Black, Hispanic or Native American women. And, generally speaking, the gap is narrower in a given job when men and women are in their early- to mid-20s (i.e., when they are new to the workforce and before children come along), and also when comparing wages by title, tenure and education level within a given field. But no matter how you slice and dice the data, there are very few scenarios in which women on average earn the same as men. Indeed, in its latest analysis of median weekly earnings last year by occupation, the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research found that women earned less than men not only in all 20 of the largest occupations for men but also in all 20 of the largest occupations for women. Among the largest occupations for women, the most egregious pay gaps were among financial managers (women earned 71% of every dollar a man earns), retail salesperson (72%), education and child care administrators (79%), administrative assistants (80%) and managers (81%). The narrowest gap was among cashiers, where women almost have pay parity (98%) with their male colleagues. Same old (and annoying) story every year While the overall gender pay gap has been narrowing over time \u2014 for example, Equal Pay Day in 2005 was April 19, a full five weeks later than this year\u2019s \u2014 the very fact that \ufeffsuch a gap exists at all in 2024 is a reminder that employers and society still have work to do in recognizing the value of women\u2019s contributions at work. \u201cThe gender wage gap is a national disgrace,\u201d said\u00a0Jamila Taylor, IWPR\u2019s president and CEO, in a statement. \u201cEven in professions typically dominated by women, men earn more for doing the same job. Equal pay for equal work has been the law of the land for more than a half-century, yet\u00a0women still cannot get fair treatment when it comes to employment and earnings. And it\u2019s worse for women of color, who face rampant racial discrimination in the workforce in addition to ongoing pay inequities.\u201d The good news is that there are now multiple efforts that may over time help reduce the problem. They include an increasing number of state-level pay transparency laws and bans on employers asking job candidates for their salary histories, which can help chronically underpaid women gain more of an equal footing when they apply for new jobs. There is also now a ban on federal government agencies asking job candidates\u2019 for their salary history and a proposed rule that would prohibit federal contractors from doing the same, as well as requiring them to post in their job ads the pay for given positions. But Vagins and others in the campaign for equal pay also want to see action at the federal legislative level, supporting two bills: the Salary Transparency Act and the Paycheck Fairness Act, which have been introduced in the US House and Senate multiple times. For instance, the Paycheck Fairness Act would, according to Equal Pay Today, \u201cbar retaliation against workers who voluntarily discuss or disclose their wages; close loopholes that have allowed employers to pay women less than men for the same work \u2026 [and] ensure women can receive the same robust remedies for sex-based pay discrimination that are currently available to those subjected to discrimination based on race and ethnicity.\u201d Absent such federal laws requiring all employers to make equal pay more of an imperative, Vagins said, achieving true pay parity for women will be slow in coming.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/12/success/equal-pay-day-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_20_business_olive-garden-discounts", "text": "Restaurant chains from Applebee\u2019s to McDonald\u2019s have in recent months clocked a troubling trend: Customers watching their budgets are spending less, and dining out less often. So they\u2019ve come up with a solution \u2014\u00a0offer meal deals and discounts to bring people back. But Olive Garden is holding out. \u201cWe\u2019re not doing that,\u201d said Rick Cardenas, CEO of Olive Garden\u2019s parent company Darden Restaurants, during an analyst call Thursday. \u201cEven at a time that our competitors have ramped up discounting.\u201d There\u2019s a reason that so many restaurants are turning to discounts now, after years of avoiding the practice. Since the start of the pandemic, chains have been hiking prices dramatically \u2014 partially because of increasing costs, and partially because customers didn\u2019t seem to mind spending more. But recently, diners have started to push back. So restaurants started offering\u00a0temporary discounts on those higher menu prices. The Italian casual dining chain has bucked the trend, making relatively moderate pricing increases and avoiding deep discounts. The approach has yielded mixed results. In the past, Olive Garden used to outperform the industry during times of economic uncertainty. The chain has lost that edge, at least in terms of sales. In the quarter ending on May 26, sales at Olive Garden restaurants open at least 16 months dropped 1.5%. Still, Cardenas is confident in the strategy. \u201cWe think that everyday low value \u2026 is more sustainable than deep discounting to try to drive people in,\u201d he said Thursday. \u201cThis is a long game for us.\u201d Raising prices, but not by much Customers have recently started to fume over higher prices, particularly at fast food restaurants. On TikTok, complaints of\u00a0$3 McDonald\u2019s hash browns\u00a0and\u00a0$16 meals have gone viral. The grumblings reached such a fever pitch that chains like Applebee\u2019s and Chili\u2019s have made a bid for those customers, offering deals that they say put their prices on par with those at popular fast food chains. Olive Garden has tried to avoid such pushback by keeping its price increases low. In the most recent quarter, Olive Garden raised prices by 1%. That change hurt dollar sales, but kept restaurant traffic strong, Darden CFO Raj Vennam argued during the call Thursday. \u201cWhile Olive Garden same restaurant sales were below the industry, same-restaurant guest counts outperformed the industry,\u201d Vennam said. \u201cThis dynamic was due to our decision to minimize pricing.\u201d Over the course of the fiscal year, Olive Garden hiked prices up about 3.5%, compared to roughly 4% across Darden\u2019s brands, which include LongHorn Steakhouse, Eddie V\u2019s and Cheddar\u2019s Scratch Kitchen, among other chains. Next year, executives expect Olive Garden to once again raise prices below Darden\u2019s brands overall. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about huge pricing actions,\u201d said Vennam. The increases put Olive Garden more or less on par with most sit-down restaurants in the US. According to inflation data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, menu prices at full-service, or sit-down, restaurants rose 3.5% in the twelve months through May. They jumped 4.5% at limited-service restaurants, which include fast food and fast casual locations. The problem with discounting Offering deals is a short-term fix to declining sales, but it\u2019s a risky business. A race to the bottom is \u201calways the danger,\u201d when it comes to cutting prices, David Henkes, a senior principal at the food industry research and consulting firm Technomic, previously told CNN. \u201cMargin and profitability is going to be the challenge for 2024,\u201d he said. \u201cThese value meals in the short term are only going to exacerbate that.\u201d Cardenas sees the practice as setting a dangerous precedent. \u201cIf you do deep discount \u2026. you have to do even more the next year,\u201d he said. \u201cThe way we do it is more sustainable.\u201d Rather than vie for customers with steep discounts, Olive Garden is planning to bring people in by highlighting its regular offerings. One example? Refills for soup or salad and breadsticks. \u201cThat refill is a pretty big part of what we do and a big part of the value equation.\u201d The chain is also hoping to get some buzz the old-fashioned way, through word of mouth. \u201cOur best way to drive sales is our focus on a back-to-basics operating philosophy and our guests telling others what a great value they have when they come to our restaurants.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/business/olive-garden-discounts/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_20_business_ai-jobs-workers-replacing", "text": "Corporate America is rapidly adopting artificial intelligence to automate work once exclusively done by humans. More than half (61%) of large US firms plan to use AI within the next year to automate tasks previously done by employees, according to a survey of finance chiefs released Thursday. Those tasks include everything from paying suppliers and doing invoices to financial reporting, said the survey conducted by Duke University and the Federal Reserve Banks of Atlanta and Richmond. That\u2019s in addition to creative tasks for which some businesses are already relying on ChatGPT and other AI chatbots to assist, including crafting job posts, writing press releases and building marketing campaigns. The findings show companies are increasingly turning to AI to cut costs, boost profits and make their workers more productive. \u201cYou can\u2019t be running an innovative company without seriously considering these technologies. You run the risk of being left behind,\u201d Duke finance professor John Graham, academic director of the survey, told CNN in a phone interview. The CFO Survey, a collaboration of Duke and the Atlanta and Richmond Fed banks, found that nearly one in three (32%) firms \u2014 large or small \u2014 plan to use AI in the next year to complete tasks once done by humans. Why bosses are deploying AI Some of this is already happening \u2014 especially among larger firms that have the financial firepower to experiment with AI. Nearly 60% of all companies (and 84% of large companies) surveyed said that over the past year they have already leaned on software, equipment or technology including AI to automate tasks employees previously did. The survey was conducted between May 13 and June 3. Bosses are turning to AI for a variety of reasons, including to trim what they are spending on human workers. The CFO Survey found that companies say they are using automation to increase product quality (58% of firms); increase output (49%), reduce labor costs (47%) and substitute for workers (33%). Still, the good news for workers is that some experts don\u2019t believe AI will cause mass job loss, at least not right away. \u201cI don\u2019t think there will be a lot of job loss in the year,\u201d said Graham. \u201cIn the short run, this will be more about plugging some holes and possibly not hiring someone they would have otherwise \u2014 but not laying someone off. In part that\u2019s because this is all-brand new.\u201d AI co-pilots on the way? Yet workers will feel the impact of AI adoption, if they aren\u2019t already. \u201cThis could give humans more time to prioritize what is most important and rewarding,\u201d said Graham. Reid Hoffman, the billionaire investor and co-founder of LinkedIn, told CNN that AI will likely disrupt some jobs but not in the immediate future. \u201cYears, not decades, but years, not months,\u201d Hoffman said, referring to the timing of AI displacing humans. \u201cI believe in three to five years, we\u2019ll all have kind of an agent co-pilot that\u2019s helping us with anything from how we cook dinner\u2026to doing your job and writing and so forth.\u201d Hoffman, who last year wrote a book called \u201cImpromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\u201d with the assistance from ChatGPT-4, stressed that for a number of years it will be a co-pilot, not a pilot. \u201cIt\u2019s job transformation. Human jobs will be replaced \u2014 but will be replaced by other humans using AI,\u201d he said. \u201cThe whole ideas is to be the human who is using AI, to learn it, to do it, to make it happen.\u201d AI and inflation For now, bosses and employees remain concerned about the cost of living and inflationary pressures. The CFO Survey found that inflation is the No. 2 concern for the next year among US chief financial officers \u2013 behind only the related concern of interest rates and monetary policy. Most CFOs (57%) expect the price of their products to increase this year at a faster-than-normal pace. However, there was a divergence in the inflation outlook based on technological adoption. The survey found that companies that implemented automation over the past 12 months expect slower price hikes than those that hadn\u2019t. Graham, the Duke professor, said that AI could eventually help moderate price increases but isn\u2019t optimistic it will be a major force to easing inflation right now. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel like it will be the cure in the next year,\u201d he said. \u2018Significant risks\u2019 The CFO survey shows how fast companies are turning to AI \u2014 even as safeguards and regulatory frameworks are still being cobbled together. The rapid adoption of AI in some industries like finance has concerned some. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned in a speech earlier this month that the use of AI by financial companies poses both \u201ctremendous opportunities and significant risks.\u201d A report issued last week by Democratic Sen. Gary Peters, chairman of the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, found that exiting regulation \u201cinsufficiently addresses\u201d how hedge funds are already using AI. The report warned that there are \u201cno regulations or requirements\u201d mandating \u201cwhen and whether a human must be involved in decision making, including related to trading decisions.\u201d Graham, the Duke professor, said it would be wise for companies in all industries to have strong risk management systems and redundancies in place as they experiment with AI. \u201cThere has been rapid adoption of AI,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope it\u2019s being done with a grain of salt. There will be some situations where companies have embarrassing products or supply chain situations because they moved a little too fast.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/business/ai-jobs-workers-replacing/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_20_media_washington-post-will-lewis-leadership-change", "text": "Two Pulitzer Prize-winning journalists at The Washington Post went on the record late Wednesday, calling for leadership change at the storied newspaper as questions swirl over the integrity of its new publisher and chief executive, Will Lewis. \u201cI don\u2019t know a single person at the Post who thinks the current situation with the publisher and supposed new editor can stand,\u201d David Maraniss, an associate editor who has worked at The Post for nearly five decades and won two Pulitzer Prizes at the newspaper, wrote in a candid Facebook post. \u201cThere might be a few, but very very few.\u201d Maraniss also zinged Jeff Bezos, the billionaire owner of The Post who installed Lewis, writing that he is \u201cnot of and for the Post or he would understand.\u201d Scott Higham, another Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist at The Post, echoed Maraniss\u2019 call for Lewis to exit the newspaper. \u201cWill Lewis needs to step down for the good of The Post and the public,\u201d Higham replied in a comment on Maraniss\u2019 post. \u201cHe has lost the newsroom and will never win it back.\u201d Spokespersons for Bezos and The Post did not immediately comment. The backlash from The Post\u2019s journalists comes after serious questions were raised about Lewis, who has been the subject of several explosive reports in recent days scrutinizing his journalistic integrity. The New York Times reported over the weekend that, in his Fleet Street days, Lewis assigned an article that was based on stolen phone records. And The Post itself reported in a 3,000-word front page expose Sunday that a \u201cthief\u201d who used deceptive tactics to obtain private material had ties with Lewis\u2019 hand-picked incoming top editor, Robert Winnett. The stories, which landed like a one-two punch in The Post\u2019s newsroom, followed reports that Lewis tried to suppress stories at The Post and NPR about his role cleaning up Rupert Murdoch\u2019s UK phone hacking scandal, when he served as a lieutenant to the right-wing media mogul. In response to the reports earlier this month, Lewis initially lashed out, criticizing his own media reporters and attacking veteran NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik, who he referred to as an \u201cactivist, not a journalist.\u201d Lewis later sent a memo to staffers, striking a notably different tone. But the note failed to quell the growing disapproval within the newspaper\u2019s ranks. Inside The Post\u2019s newsroom, morale has plunged as staffers express alarm over Lewis\u2019 conduct and worries over the future direction of the newspaper under his leadership. Interviews with nearly a dozen Post staffers and others familiar with the internal dynamics of the newspaper last week revealed a workforce that has grown increasingly dismayed by the situation, with some searching for work elsewhere. Sensing the turmoil, Bezos on Tuesday sent a memo to top leaders at The Post, expressing support for maintaining high journalistic standards at his newspaper. \u201cYou have my full commitment on maintaining the quality, ethics, and standards we all believe in,\u201d Bezos wrote. But the memo did little to quell the growing rebellion in the newsroom. Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, the professor and senior associate dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management, told CNN on Monday that Bezos should dismiss Lewis. Sonnenfeld, who has advised US presidents and scores of corporate leaders, said that if he were advising Bezos, he would tell him Lewis has \u201clost legitimacy to lead\u201d and it\u2019s time to \u201cclean the house.\u201d \u201cThis is a tragic meltdown of the conscience of American journalism bringing shame to the Katharine Graham, Ben Bradlee, Marty Baron legacy of collaboration, courage and integrity,\u201d Sonnenfeld said. \u201cBezos must recruit an accomplished, experienced editor whom journalists admire and trust.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/media/washington-post-will-lewis-leadership-change/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_06_20_cars_bugatti-horsepower-hybrid", "text": "Bugatti has unveiled its new model, the Bugatti Tourbillon, a massively powerful hybrid with an equally impressive price tag. The car will replace the $3.3 million, 1,500 horsepower Bugatti Chiron. You might have expected Bugatti\u2019s new model to be all-electric. Not only is the industry headed in that direction, but in 2021 Bugatti was spun off from Volkswagen Group and merged with Rimac, the Croatian company that makes the all-electric Rimac Nevera supercar. But Mate Rimac, the chief executive of the new company, now called Bugatti Rimac, said he never had any intention of making an all-electric Bugatti. As gasoline-powered cars gradually fade from the world\u2019s roads, Bugatti Rimac\u2019s engineers and designers wanted to create something that retained the spirit of mechanically powered Bugatti cars, just better: An insanely powerful plug-in hybrid. Like the Bugatti Chiron and Veyron models before it, the new Bugatti Tourbillon will have a huge, 16-cylinder gas engine. The engine, which was designed in cooperation with the British race car engineering firm Cosworth, will be assisted by three powerful electric motors. One motor in the back of the car and two more in the front will be capable of producing at least 800 horsepower on their own. In total, the Bugatti Tourbillon will be able to put out at least 1,800 horsepower, according to Bugatti Rimac. The electric motors will help make up for the new gas engine\u2019s lack of turbochargers. The Chiron\u2019s gas engine had four turbochargers that pushed air into the engine to help it produce more power. Mate Rimac said they wanted this new engine to be \u201cnaturally aspirated,\u201d meaning there would be no turbochargers. \u201cWe wanted to make the most exciting, most emotional combustion engine possible,\u201d Rimac said, \u201cand that is high revving, naturally aspirated.\u201d The car\u2019s interior is, likewise, an homage to old-fashioned machinery. The Tourbillon is named after a set of gears that helps maintain accuracy in a mechanical watch. The Bugatti\u2019s instrument display is modeled on mechanical watch dials. \u201cOne of the first things we did when the new company was formed, I took the whole team to Switzerland and we visited a few watchmakers,\u201d Rimac told CNN. The central speedometer display even has two needles like the hands of a clock. The long hand shows the car\u2019s speed while the short hand registers the revolutions per minute of the high-revving 16-cylinder engine. With a fully charged battery, the car will be able to travel about 37 miles on purely electric power before the gas engine needs to turn on, but the driver will have the option to run the gas engine continuously, if they wish. Unlike past Bugattis, though, the Tourbillon does have a reasonably large display screen with Apple CarPlay available. The screen will only come out and become visible when the driver requests it, though. In general, Bugatti designers have avoided putting screens in the cars in the belief that computer displays look outmoded quickly. \u201cWe think, really, how will this product look in 50 years, 100 years,\u201d said Rimac. \u201cAnd it\u2019s clear that, if you have a screen, it won\u2019t look that great.\u201d The cars will still be assembled one at a time at Bugatti\u2019s small factory in Molsheim, France. A total of only 250 Tourbillons will be built, Mate Rimac said, at a starting price of roughly $4 million each.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/cars/bugatti-horsepower-hybrid/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_15_business_child-care-crisis-providers", "text": "For the past eight years in the small city of Waupaca, Wisconsin, Susan Elandt has been a fixture for dozens of families \u2014 taking care of their children, some as early as 4:45 a.m., so they can get to work. \u201cMost of our parents, when they drop off, are like, \u2018I could never do what you do,\u2019\u201d Elandt says. \u201cAnd my response is always, \u2018Well, I can\u2019t do what you do either! So I\u2019ll watch your kids and you go do that, because I\u2019m better at this.\u2019\u201d Elandt is the owner and operator of My First Adventure Child Care and Preschool \u2014 but only for a few more weeks. She announced in May that she\u2019s closing her doors before the end of August. \u201cIt\u2019s emotionally and physically and mentally demanding,\u201d Elandt says. \u201cThere\u2019s not benefits. The pay is not anywhere near what it should be. And we don\u2019t get a lot of professional recognition in the community, either, for the value of the work that we do.\u201d Like so many centers around the country, My First Adventure is feeling the squeeze of a child care crisis that\u2019s crippling parents and providers alike. Nationwide, the average yearly cost of care rose to $11,582 per child last year, according to Child Care Aware of America\u2019s latest\u00a0annual report. Placing two kids at a child care center cost at least 25% more than the typical rent, on average, in every state. And the tab exceeded annual\u00a0typical\u00a0mortgage payments in 45 states, plus the District of Columbia. The report looked at care for an infant and a 4-year-old. While the price of keeping children in care is sky-high, the burden of running these centers is equally unsustainable. Running a center comes with a battery of expenses, from hefty insurance policies to \u201cconsumables\u201d such as art supplies, books and food. Tight margins don\u2019t leave much room for the biggest cost \u2014 staff \u2014 which is also Elandt\u2019s biggest challenge. \u201cIf you were going to pay your teachers what they were worth even based off of basic education and experience, you would need to charge the parents so much that you would have no children in your center, no could parents afford care,\u201d she says. The basic costs of employing enough staff to comply with legal and safety requirements in child care centers are already high. The costs are also compounded by the additional expenses of fielding high staff turnover, due in large part to the low wages that these employers can afford to pay. Over the years, Elandt has struggled to keep employees because she can\u2019t compete with what\u2019s offered by local factories or even fast food restaurants. The typical hourly wage for a child care worker in Wisconsin is $13.78, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. \u201cIt\u2019s very humbling to go to work every day and pass Help Wanted signs at McDonald\u2019s and Hardee\u2019s, and they are paying more money than child care providers can afford to pay their staff,\u201d says Lydia Higgins, a teacher at My First Adventure. The child care industry got a brief boost during the Covid-19 pandemic, as federal funding allowed providers to give their staff much-needed raises and bonuses, as well as cover their rent, mortgages and utilities and buy personal protective equipment and other supplies. Elandt was able to bring up her starting salaries from $8 or $9 an hour to $12 and reward more experienced teachers, attracting and retaining enough employees to keep the center open during the depths of the pandemic. Facing a \u201cchild care cliff\u201d The historic $24 billion federal investment helped more than 225,000 providers nationwide \u2014 or more than 8 in 10 licensed child care centers \u2014 and affected as many as 10 million children. But it expired last September, leaving many centers facing what\u2019s been dubbed \u201cthe child care cliff.\u201d An analysis last year by The Century Foundation projected that more than 70,000 child care programs could close and about 3.2 million children could lose their spots due to the end of the federal child care stabilization grant program, which Congress approved as part of the 2021 American Rescue Plan Act. Multiple states have beefed up their child care investments in recent years, but it\u2019s generally not enough to keep all providers afloat. Elandt has implemented several rate increases for parents in the last year, knowing it would increase their burden. She felt there was no other choice because a return to pre-pandemic salaries would likely mean losing her whole staff. In some cases the higher wages weren\u2019t enough. A few months ago, she says, one of her employees left for a factory: \u201cShe needed to make a living.\u201d The stresses of managing a tight budget and dealing with staff turnover have taken a toll.Elandt first started thinking seriously about leaving her business two years ago and tried to sell, but no viable option emerged. In May, she made the formal announcement that this summer would be the center\u2019s last. The news left families and staff scrambling. Higgins, who is also a parent at My First Adventure, described the moment as \u201cpanic.\u201d As more and more child care providers and parents find themselves struggling through this crisis, she hopes bigger picture solutions will emerge. \u201cIt needs to start with an awareness of how critical this crisis is, and not just from the parents that are terrified and suffering through it, but as a whole picture as a whole country,\u201d Higgins said. \u201cI think everybody was really aware during the height of the pandemic, with the critical workers and things like that. I don\u2019t know if that has started to fade out for people.\u201d The city of Waupaca is actively trying to help facilitate a sale to keep the facility or re-open it under new ownership. As it stands, My First Adventure is expected to close in July. This fall will find Elandt in the public school system, where she\u2019s found joy the past few months working as a substitute teacher. Both she and Higgins say they plan to get more involved in activism to raise the voices of child care workers and fight for better conditions. \u201cWe are literally shaping tomorrow\u2019s youth,\u201d Higgins says. \u201cI think that needs to start being reflected in compensation and policies and where government funding is being directed.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/15/business/child-care-crisis-providers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_15_success_best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund", "text": "The average federal tax refund is more than $3,000, according to the latest data from the IRS. Since the majority of tax filers get a refund, there\u2019s a fair chance you could get hundreds if not thousands of dollars back in overpaid taxes, especially if you\u2019re also owed a refund from your state government. That money may feel like a windfall, and it\u2019s easy to squander it on a lot of little things. But if you\u2019re looking to improve your current financial situation, here are seven ideas to consider. Well, technically six, but you\u2019ll enjoy the seventh the most. 1. Pay off high-rate debt If you are carrying a balance on your credit card and are paying 20% to 30% in interest, make this your first priority to pay down. At such sky-high rates, \u201cthe debt can grow faster than you can pay it off,\u201d said Eric Bronnenkant, a certified financial planner and head of tax at Betterment, a robo-advisory financial services firm that also has a human advice team on hand to help clients. Keyana Russ, a certified financial planner at Four Ponds Financial Planning, concurred that people\u2019s awareness of how much money they\u2019re paying in interest over time doesn\u2019t always register. \u201cWhat I usually see is people paying the minimum, or they\u2019re charging everyday expenses and not paying off the bill at the end of the month. \u2026 They don\u2019t understand how much interest they\u2019re paying,\u201d Russ said. For example, if you\u2019re carrying a $3,000 balance at 27% interest and you only pay a required minimum of $97.50 every month, it will take you 240 months (which is 20 years) just to pay off the $3,000 \u2014 and, in addition, you will have paid $3,044.57 in interest, for a total of $6,044.57, according to Bankrate.com\u2019s calculator. 2. Create or add to an emergency fund You can use your refund to start or bolster an emergency fund. When it comes to costly emergencies, there are many Americans who don\u2019t have at least three months\u2019 worth of living expenses set aside, let alone enough to easily handle an unexpected bill of $1,000. Be sure to stash the money in a high-yield savings account at an FDIC-insured bank, Russ suggested, noting that the best interest rates are typically offered by online banks. If you have high-rate debt and you\u2019re lacking emergency savings, Russ suggested you might use a portion of your refund to attack your debt and the other portion to create an emergency fund. Bronnenkant favors paying off the high-rate debt first, but, if you\u2019re low on emergency savings and need a critical repair to help keep your job \u2014 such as on your car \u2014 he said it might make sense to set aside money for that repair and put the rest toward your credit card or other high-rate debt. 3. Make an extra payment on your mortgage If you\u2019re carrying a mortgage at a high rate (e.g., 7% to 8%), and you\u2019re not saddled with credit card debt, you might consider making an extra payment or two. \u201cIt can make a difference in the long run towards your principal,\u201d Russ said.\u00a0 You can even view it as an additional form of savings, in the sense that you\u2019re saving yourself an extra 7% \ufeffor so in interest on the portion of the principal you\u2019re paying down, Bronnenkant noted. 4. Invest in a Roth IRA If your income qualifies you to contribute to a Roth IRA, you can contribute up to $7,000 this year ($8,000 if you\u2019re at least 50) with after-tax savings. That money will grow untaxed until retirement, at which point your withdrawals will be tax-free and penalty-free after age 59-1/2, assuming the account has been open for at least five years. (And note: You can still make a 2023 Roth contribution until April 15 this year. The contribution limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if you\u2019re age 50 or older. Bolstering your tax-free retirement savings is great.\u00a0But if you need to access some of your money well before you retire, you may take out any part of your contributions tax-free and penalty-free at any time, \ufeffBronnenkant said. You would only be taxed and penalized if you withdrew the earnings on your contributions before age 59-1/2. (For more information on Roth IRA withdrawal rules, here is an easy-to-understand rundown from Charles Schwab.) 5. Contribute enough to your 401(k) in 2024 to get your full employer match Speaking of retirement savings, if you\u2019re not yet contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match from your employer, a refund can make that easier. Say you get $3,000 back. You can put that money in a high-yield savings account to earn interest. Then, on your workplace 401(k) site, change your paycheck contribution levels so that by the end of the year you will have contributed $3,000 more in pre-tax money than you otherwise would have. For instance, say you\u2019re paid every two weeks and you have 20 more paychecks left until the end of the year. You can boost you biweekly contributions by $150 per paycheck ($150 x 20 = $3,000). \u201cYou want to get the max match from your employer,\u201d Bronnenkant said. 6. Invest for shorter-term goals If in the next three to 10 years you expect to buy a home, take a once-in-a-lifetime trip, renovate a room, send your kids to summer camp or have any other expensive goal, you might consider investing your refund in a diversified mix of low-cost, broad market index funds. The shorter term your goal is, the less risk you want to take. If you need the money within three years, you might consider putting your refund in certificates of deposits and US Treasury bonds. But if your goal is five to 10 years out, and you\u2019re comfortable taking on some more risk and are willing to accept fluctuations in the market, Bronnenkant said, you might put no more than 30% of your refund in a stock index fund and 70% in a total market bond fund if your risk tolerance is conservative; or 50% in each if you have a moderate risk tolerance. If you plan on sending your child to college and you have a 529 plan, you can use your refund to boost your contributions to that plan, Russ said. You may also get a tax break for your contribution depending on the state where you live. 7. Have some fun Unless you\u2019re in truly dire financial straits, if you get a large refund, you might set aside a small portion to do whatever you truly enjoy. \u201cSometimes you just want to have fun and not have it be all business,\u201d Russ said. \u201cYou can set aside some of the money to have fun.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/15/success/best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "business"}}

After dozens of reports of lacerations from exposed blades, Vitamix announced a recall of about 569,000 blending containers and blade bases for its high-powered blenders. It expands on an extensive recall already issued in 2018 for some of the most expensive and well-known blenders on the market. The recall said that the container can separate from the blade base and can expose the blades. Twenty-seven people have reported lacerations to Vitamix, which includes 11 reports from a 2018 recall that affected more than 100,000 units. Vitamix is not offering replacements or a refund. All affected customers should immediately stop using the recalled parts, the company said, and contact Vitamix for a repair kit. The repair kit includes a protective plastic shroud to put over the blade base as well as additional instructions. The company said it worked with Health Canada and the US Consumer Product Safety Commission to evaluate the potential remedies, and all three agreed on the repair kit. \u201cVitamix\u2019s top priority is the safety of its customers. To ensure Vitamix has a well-built product, Vitamix products undergo extensive testing, leveraging the 130+ test procedures in Vitamix\u2019s catalog to assess every component for quality and durability,\u201d Vitamix said in a statement. Vitamix instructed customers who repaired their blenders in the 2018 recall to stop using those blender parts as well. The recall affects all Ascent and Venturist Series 8-ounce blending containers, 20-ounce blending containers, and blade bases. Faulty blade bases and blending containers may have been sold separately, according to the recall posted on the CPSC website. \u201cThe clear containers and black blade bases are included with certain Vitamix Venturist and Ascent Series blenders, such as the Venturist V1200, Ascent A2300, Ascent A2500, Ascent A3300, and Ascent A3500 blenders; and also sold separately, as sets, or bundles in various configurations,\u201d the recall said. Ascent blenders can retail for up to $749.95 and the Venturist V1200 can retail for up to $549.95 on the Vitamix website. The bundles cost even more and add to the base price, bringing the total to nearly $1,000. The pricey blenders were sold at Costco, Best Buy, Crate & Barrel, Macy\u2019s, Target, Williams Sonoma, Walmart and specialty stores from April 2017 through May 2024.

{"id": "2024_06_17_business_china-property-price-record-slump-intl-hnk", "text": "Prices of new homes in China suffered their biggest fall in nearly a decade last month, in a sign that Beijing\u2019s \u201chistoric\u201d real estate rescue has not yet revived demand. Prices in 70 major cities were down 0.7% in May from April, National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) figures showed on Monday. That\u2019s the steepest month-on-month drop since October 2014, according to Reuters calculation. According to separate calculations by the Macquarie Group, prices of existing homes in those cities fell by 7.5% year-on-year last month, marking the biggest decline on record. A month ago, Beijing unveiled wide-ranging measures to rescue the crisis-hit property market, including asking local governments across the country to buy unsold homes from beleaguered developers and easing rules on purchases. \u201cTo be fair, one month is too short for the housing rescue package to take effect,\u201d said analysts from Societe Generale on Monday. Measures, including efforts to provide cheap loans to state-owned enterprises for buying unsold homes from distressed developers, will \u201ctake time\u201d to have an impact on the property market, the analysts said. Still, other numbers on the real estate sector remain bleak. Property investment for the first five months of the year dropped 10.1% from a year ago, according the NBS on Monday. New property sales fell 28% during the same period. A mixed bag Some parts of the Chinese economy reported a more optimistic picture, according to a separate set of top indicators released by the NBS on Monday. Retail sales increased 3.7% in May, accelerating from a 2.3% rise in April and beating market forecasts. Much of that boost came from a massive government trade-in programs for used cars and old home appliances, aimed at bolstering domestic consumption. The Labor Day \u201cGolden Week\u201d holiday, which ran from May 1 to May 5, also helped reignite some consumer spending. Industrial output lost some momentum, growing 5.6% in May from a year ago, compared to April\u2019s 6.7% increase. Fixed asset investment also missed expectations. But China\u2019s exports jumped 7.6% in May, marking the fastest pace since April 2023, according to customs data released earlier this month. Imports, however, fell short of estimates. \u201cThe growth is highly uneven,\u201d with exports as the driver and the property sector acting as a drag, said Macquarie analysts. The threat of deflation continues to haunt the world\u2019s second largest economy as domestic demand remains weak. The consumer price index inched up just 0.3% in May, unchanged from April, according to the NBS last week.\u00a0That was slightly below expectations. Producer prices dropped 1.4%, down for a 20th consecutive month. \u201cWhile China\u2019s growth remains uneven, we think more policy support is likely to come through to help keep growth on track for this year\u2019s GDP growth target [of around 5%],\u201d said analysts from HSBC on Monday. \u201cMore attention will turn towards next month\u2019s Third Plenum (of the Communist Party) which will highlight economic reforms for the coming years,\u201d they said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/business/china-property-price-record-slump-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_20_tech_new-york-hochul-social-media-algorithms-children", "text": "Big changes are coming for New York\u2019s youngest social media users after Gov. Kathy Hochul signed two bills into law Thursday clamping down on digital platforms\u2019 algorithms and use of children\u2019s data. The unprecedented move makes New York the first state to pass a law regulating social media algorithms amid nationwide allegations that apps such as Instagram or TikTok have hooked users with addictive features. Hochul\u2019s signature comes days after US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy called for warning labels to be applied to social media platforms, fueling a debate about social media\u2019s potential impact on the mental health of users, particularly teens. Under New York\u2019s SAFE For Kids Act, social media platforms will be required to display content chronologically by default for kids under 18, while the New York Child Data Protection Act will restrict websites from collecting or sharing the personal data of users under 18 without consent \u2014 expanding on existing federal privacy protections for children under 13. The SAFE For Kids Act also requires platforms to limit late-night app notifications that state lawmakers say are engineered to drive user engagement and that risk hindering sleep. Both pieces of legislation were introduced last fall and cleared the state legislature in early June. New York officials hailed the legislation as a critical check on social media platforms\u2019 influence over teens. \u201cToday, we save our children,\u201d Hochul said Thursday at a press conference. \u201cWe have heard their cries for help, reminding us as adults that we have a moral responsibility to protect young New Yorkers from harm and from addictive forces.\u201d In a statement Thursday afternoon, a Meta spokesperson said, \u201cWhile we don\u2019t agree with every aspect of these bills, we welcome New York becoming the first state to pass legislation recognizing the responsibility of app stores.\u201d \u201cAccording to research, the vast majority of parents support legislation requiring app stores to obtain parental approval to download apps, and we will continue to work with policymakers in New York and elsewhere to advance this approach,\u201d the spokesperson said. CNN has reached out to Google, Snap and TikTok for comment. Some academics have said that while studies highlight associations between specific types of social media activities and negative mental health outcomes \u2013 such as engaging in social comparison \u2013 a causal link between those harms and general social media use is less clear. Still, numerous states and federal lawmakers have pushed for legislation clamping down on social media platforms, arguing that tech companies\u2019 products are to blame for eating disorders, sleeplessness, distraction and, in some cases, self-harm and suicide. \u201cWe will save lives with this, my friends,\u201d Hochul said at Thursday\u2019s press conference. New York Attorney General Letitia James added Thursday that the legislation would take on \u201cthe most dangerous aspects of social media, the addictive algorithm feeds that exploit impressionable minds.\u201d \u201cThese bills will empower my office to set rules and ensure companies are following them,\u201d James said. Opponents of the social media algorithm bill \u2014 including but not limited to the tech industry \u2014 have said the legislation is likely unconstitutional because it infringes on children\u2019s First Amendment rights and raises other questions about how social media can function in practice across state lines. \u201cIt\u2019s a well-intentioned effort, but it\u2019s aimed at the wrong target,\u201d said Adam Kovacevich, CEO of the tech industry advocacy group Chamber of Progress. \u201cAlgorithmic curation makes teenagers\u2019 feeds healthier, and banning algorithms is going to make social media worse for teens.\u201d The legislation\u2019s signing sets the stage for another in a long string of court battles over state social media laws. States such as Arkansas, Florida, Louisiana and many others have passed laws clamping down on social media companies\u2019 approach to teens. Industry groups have challenged some of that legislation, and courts have largely viewed the laws with skepticism. In Ohio this year, for example, a federal judge temporarily blocked a law prohibiting online platforms from creating accounts for users under 16 unless they obtain parental consent, saying the legislation likely violates the First Amendment. Two states, Texas and Florida, have passed laws that would restrict online platforms from moderating their sites; legal challenges reached the Supreme Court this term and a decision is expected within weeks.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/tech/new-york-hochul-social-media-algorithms-children/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_06_19_media_wikipedia-adl", "text": "Wikipedia\u2019s editors declared that the Anti-Defamation League cannot be trusted to give reliable information on the Israel-Palestine conflict, and they overwhelmingly said the ADL is an unreliable source on antisemitism. It\u2019s a stunning rebuke to one of the world\u2019s preeminent authorities on anti-Jewish hate and a significant advocate for the rights and causes of American Jews. The editors, a group of volunteer moderators for one of the world\u2019s most popular information websites, voted last week to label the ADL as a \u201cgenerally unreliable\u201d source on the Israel-Palestine conflict. That means that the ADL should usually not be cited in Wikipedia articles on that topic except for extraordinary circumstances. Other generally unreliable sources, according to Wikipedia editors, include Russian state media, Fox News\u2019 political coverage and Amazon reviews. The ADL also faces a vote from Wikipedia editors to potentially label the organization as unreliable on the topic of antisemitism. The editors overwhelmingly support that label but continue to debate the decision, which could ultimately deal a blow to the credibility of the leading source of research and information on antisemitism. JTA was first to report the vote. The Wikipedia editors said in an online forum that the ADL\u2019s dual role as an advocacy and research organization prevented it from providing unbiased accounts on Israel or antisemitism. \u201cThe ADL is heavily biased regarding Israel/Palestine to the point of often acting as a pro-Israel lobbying organization,\u201d wrote an editor with the username Loki, who has edited more than 3,000 Wikipedia articles. \u201cThis can and does compromise its ability to accurately report facts regarding people and organizations that disagree with it on this issue, especially non-Zionist or anti-Zionist Jews and Jewish organizations.\u201d A minority of editors disagreed, arguing the editors voting in favor failed to provide evidence that the ADL has made false claims because of its advocacy work. The ADL strongly rebuked the decision. \u201cIt is deeply disturbing that the many editors who flagged the severe flaws and inaccuracies in both the reasoning and sources being used in this campaign to delegitimize ADL are being ignored,\u201d an ADL spokesman said in a statement. \u201cThey have provided point by point refutations, grounded in factual citations, to every claim made, but apparently facts no longer matter.\u201d Calling the decision \u201ca sad development for research and education\u201d and \u201cdevastating for the Jewish community and society,\u201d the ADL said it would continue its work to fight antisemitism. But the spokesman warned Wikipedia\u2019s action would prevent information on antisemitism from reaching the public. ADL adapts to a changing world Prior to Hamas\u2019 deadly attack on Israel on October 7, the ADL had been largely focused on educating about and advocating for action against the rise in antisemitism around the world. That alarming trend included (and continues to include) a growing number of threats and anti-Jewish actions taken by White supremacist groups, and ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt became a frequent guest on television news, such as CNN. After the events of October 7 and the ongoing war that followed, the ADL produced numerous reports about rising antisemitic hate speech and incidents, particularly on college campuses. It produced two report cards on universities\u2019 actions to protect Jewish students, giving failing grades to more than a dozen colleges. But the ADL faced some criticism for doubling down on what some detractors believed was an overly broad definition of antisemitism that included anti-Zionism and some anti-Israel speech and actions. \u201cADL\u2019s leadership has taken a much more aggressive stance than most academic researchers in blurring the distinction between anti-Zionism and antisemitism,\u201d said James Loeffler, professor of modern Jewish history at John Hopkins University. \u201cIt\u2019s clear from reading the Wikipedia editors\u2019 conversation that they are heavily influenced by the ADL leadership\u2019s comments.\u201d Greenblatt and the ADL made clear that political opposition to Israel\u2019s government and policies were acceptable and not antisemitic. But those who denied Jews had the right to self-determination and freedom in their homeland were antisemitic, according to the ADL. \u201cLet\u2019s make this very clear: Anti-Zionism is antisemitism,\u201d Greenblatt said at an ADL \u201cState of Hate\u201d event in March. \u201cAntizionism is a negation of Jewish history, a denial of Jewish humanity.\u201d That didn\u2019t sit well with Wikipedia\u2019s editors. For example, one editor, with the username Sameboat, claimed the ADL leader\u2019s advocacy \u201cdemonstrates its skewed views and manipulative presentation on the IP (Israel-Palestine) topic and thus (is) highly unreliable.\u201d Balancing advocacy with trusted information The ADL has built an expertise in tracking antisemitic threats and hate groups and has done beneficial work in providing the world with information and data about antisemitism, particularly because so few organizations are doing that kind of research, noted Loeffler. And the fact that the ADL balances advocacy with research is not a new problem for the organization. But Wikipedia\u2019s decision may reflect a changing landscape that the ADL needs to reckon with. The war in Gaza has deeply divided people of all backgrounds, including Jews. The war has added significant ambiguity and complications to the world\u2019s view of the Israel-Palestine conflict. If Wikipedia\u2019s editors are distancing themselves from the ADL, that could suggest media, academic and partnering advocacy organizations will think twice about how they approach ADL data in their own efforts to inform their audiences on antisemitism. \u201cThe challenge to the ADL is to separate the advocacy from the data when it comes to the overall message,\u201d Loeffler said. \u201cI think this is going to be a difficult blow to the credibility to the ADL in its role on this issue. The staff there will continue to do rigorous work, but this will provide an opportunity for self-reflection.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/media/wikipedia-adl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "business"}}

Statistics suggest that flying commercial is still the safest way to travel. But the first half of this year has been one incident after another \u2014 which could reasonably give passengers pause before booking their next flight. Even some of those who believe flying is safer than the car ride to or from the nearest airport say they understand the growing concern of passengers. When a door plug blew out on an Alaska Airlines flight on January 5, it did more than leave a gaping hole in the Boeing 737 Max fuselage. It caused some passengers\u2019 phones and clothing to be ripped from their bodies and sent hurtling out into the night as oxygen masks dropped and the plane made its way to the ground, fortunately without any serious injuries. And it also brought new attention to the potential hazards of flying. It\u2019s not just events in the air shaking the confidence of nervous flyers, but also reports on the ground. Congress has heard from a dozen whistleblowers about safety issues at Boeing, telling stories about questionable parts and \u201cdefective airplanes.\u201d But answering the question of whether it is still safe to fly is not so straightforward as statistics showing fewer deaths on commercial flights than on the roads or other forms or transportation might suggest. The quick answer is that flying is safe \u2014 safer than most forms of travel \u2014 and far, far safer than car rides most people take every day without thinking twice. \u201cWhen you arrive at the airport and step aboard the pressurized tube, that\u2019s the safest part of the trip,\u201d said Anthony Brickhouse, a crash investigator and professor of aviation safety at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, in an interview with CNN earlier this year. \u201cYou were more at risk driving to the airport.\u201d But it\u2019s also true that it\u2019s only pure luck that the American aviation industry has kept its near-perfect safety record intact. 15 nearly perfect years Since a regional jet crashed in Buffalo, New York, in January of 2009, killing 49 on board and one on the ground, only five other people have died in accidents on scheduled commercial flights in the United States: \u2022 Three passengers were killed in 2013 when an Asiana Airlines plane broke apart, crashing short of the runway in San Francisco.\u2022 A passenger on a 2018 Southwest flight died when an engine cover broke off and shattered the window next to where she was sitting.\u2022 A passenger was killed in 2019 when a small plane skidded off the runway in rural Alaska. By comparison, an average of more than 100 people a day died on America\u2019s roads and highways between 2003 and 2022, the most recent year for which full-year traffic deaths are available. That means nearly as many died on roads and highways every hour, on average, as the number of people who died in US commercial aviation crashes in 15 years. However, other forms of flying are not nearly as safe. Nearly 300 people have died since 2009 while traveling in on-demand air service, such as private jets. And nearly 5,500 people have died in general aviation, typically small planes often operated by amateur pilots. While commercial aviation has the safest record among transit options, railroads are the second safest form of travel. Railroads had 71 passenger deaths on commuter trains and Amtrak from 2009 through last year. But passenger trains logged far fewer miles traveled than planes or motor vehicles. When you control for the much higher number of miles traveled by planes, it\u2019s clearly much more dangerous to travel on the ground than to fly on a commercial US airline. Ed Pierson is the director of the Foundation for Aviation Safety and a harsh critic of Boeing \u2014 which, in addition to the Alaska Airlines incident and the recent congressional hearings on the safety of the manufacturer\u2019s planes, had two fatal crashes of the 737 Max, one in 2018 and one in 2019, that led to a 20-month grounding of the plane. He said he knows the stats, but because of concerns about quality controls at the embattled aircraft maker, he still would refuse to fly on the Boeing 737 Max or have a family member do so. He has even got off a Max just before departure after he was surprised to find out he was on that particular model of plane. Still, Pierson said he is willing to fly on most planes, even many older Boeing models. \u201cTaking the Max out of the equation, (flying has) been proven to be pretty darn safe,\u201d he said in an interview with CNN earlier this year. A rash of scary incidents The Alaska Airlines incident is by far the most high-profile event this year, but it is hardly the only one to make headlines across the world. On January 2, just days before the Alaska Airlines flight, a passenger plane collided with a military plane at a Tokyo airport, killing five members of the Japanese Coast Guard who were responding to an earthquake. On March 11, a LATAM Airlines Boeing jet plunged so severely that passengers were thrown onto the ceiling of the cabin, leaving dozens so injured they need to be hospitalized upon landing. A Southwest jet plunged to within 400 feet of the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Hawaii on April 11. A JetBlue plane and Southwest plane nearly collided on the runway of Reagan National Airport in Washington on April 18, when one was cleared for takeoff as the other was directed to cross the runway it was on. Severe turbulence experienced over Myanmar by a Singapore Airlines plane on May 21 resulted in one passenger dying and 71 being injured, some critically. And another Southwest jet ended up with significant damage when it experienced an unusual and unsafe back-and-forth motion known in the industry as a\u00a0\u201cDutch roll\u201d on a May 25 flight from Phoenix to Oakland. There are also more minor incidents, like when a 200-pound wheel fell off a plane on takeoff, crushing parked vehicles on the ground. A jet arrived at an airport only to have a missing panel discovered. And several planes had engines catch fire. Disaster narrowly averted Still, most of these incidents did not involve fatalities, and the deaths that occurred were far outside of US airspace. Unfortunately, the safety record of recent years is not a guarantee of safety in the future. The record for the nearly fatality-free US airplane travel industry is partly due to the efforts of aviation authorities, airlines and aircraft manufacturers, despite the criticism heaped on all three of those groups recently. But mainly it\u2019s been sheer luck. In each case, if things had gone just a little differently, the outcomes could have been much worse. The Alaska Airlines plane that lost the door plug had flown for more than two months without the four bolts needed to keep the plug in place, according to the National Transportation Safety Board. It had made 153 flights before the door plug blew out at 16,000 feet. Twenty-two of those flights were between Hawaii and the mainland. If the door had blown out at the normal 35,000-foot cruising altitude, or hours from the nearest airport over the open Pacific Ocean, or if the plug had gone straight back and hit the tail of the plane and caused damage, it could likely have caused a loss of the aircraft and the 177 people on board. Near disasters for planes on the ground On February 4, 2023, a FedEx jet came within 150 feet of the runway before its pilots realized a Southwest jet was in the process of taking off on the same runway. It was one of five such incidents in a period of just seven weeks at the start of last year in which an accident was only narrowly avoided. And none of those were potentially as serious as the incident in July 2017, when an Air Canada jet piloted by a captain who had been awake for more than 19 hours nearly landed on a taxiway at San Francisco International Airport where three wide-body jets filled with passengers were waiting to take off. The NTSB later determined the Air Canada jet got within 100 feet of the ground before it took off again without making contact with any of the passenger planes on the ground. The safety regulator said more than 1,000 people on the four planes might have died had the accident not been averted at the last moment. \u201cIt would have been the worst disaster in aviation history,\u201d Brickhouse said. \u201cPilots, air traffic controllers, mechanics \u2014 they\u2019re all human, and humans make mistakes. We\u2019ve been working toward designing the system so that when mistakes are made, we can recover from them without it being a tragedy.\u201d The NTSB has been calling for 24 years for a warning system in cockpits to alert of a possible collision on a runway. But so far there\u2019s been no move to require the technology, which already exists. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be technology that prevents any of this from reoccurring,\u201d NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy told CNN earlier this month. Pierson said regulators, airlines and aircraft manufacturers like Boeing need to make changes. \u201cI think the system is under tremendous stress,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a shortage of staff, in air traffic control, a shortage of pilots, of maintenance personnel, of manufacturing personnel.\u201d Plagued by overconfidence? What concerns Pierson the most is the attitude that the apparent safety of the American aviation system means nothing needs to be improved. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense of overconfidence,\u201d he said. \u201cThe gold standard is melting down, because we continue to try to downplay everything and talk about how safe the system is. That\u2019s not the right mindset. That\u2019s the mindset that gets people killed.\u201d Brickhouse believes the planes now in use are safe. He said the Alaska Airlines incident brought attention to a series of other events that in and of themselves don\u2019t pose a serious threat, even if they should not have happened. \u201cWe have safety events in aviation all the time. That is not an indictment of the aviation industry,\u201d he said. \u201cBut after Alaska Air, it became a snowballing event and everyone became hypersensitive.\u201d Despite having more confidence in the safety of the system than Pierson, Brickhouse said he also wouldn\u2019t dismiss anyone who\u2019s fearful about flying right now or who wants to avoid a plane like the 737 Max. And he has his own concerns about things like the number of narrowly avoided accidents at the nation\u2019s airports. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in luck, but we are fortunate that these incidents did not turn into disasters,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you have a trend that keeps occurring, you need to focus on fixing it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/business/is-it-safe-to-fly-airplanes-boeing-max/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_20_tech_openai-ilya-sutskever-safe-super-intelligence-new-company", "text": "The OpenAI co-founder who left the high-flying artificial intelligence startup last month has announced his next venture: a company dedicated to building safe, powerful artificial intelligence that could become a rival to his old employer. Ilya Sutskever announced plans for the new company, aptly named Safe Superintelligence Inc., in a post on X Wednesday. \u201cSSI is our mission, our name, and our entire product roadmap, because it is our sole focus. Our team, investors, and business model are all aligned to achieve SSI,\u201d a statement posted to the company\u2019s website reads. \u201cWe plan to advance capabilities as fast as possible while making sure our safety always remains ahead. This way, we can scale in peace.\u201d The announcement comes amid growing concerns in the tech world and beyond that AI may be advancing more quickly than research on using the technology safely and responsibly, as well as a dearth of regulation that has left tech companies largely free to set safety guidelines for themselves. Sutskever is considered one of the early pioneers of the AI revolution. As a student, he worked in a machine learning lab under Geoffrey Hinton, known as the \u201cGodfather of AI,\u201d where they created an AI startup that was later acquired by Google. Sutskever then worked on Google\u2019s AI research team, before helping to found what would become the maker of ChatGPT. But things got complicated for Sutskever at OpenAI when he was involved in an effort to oust CEO Sam Altman last year, which resulted in the dramatic leadership shuffle that saw Altman fired, then rehired and the company\u2019s board overhauled, all within about a week. CNN contributor Kara Swisher\u00a0previously reported\u00a0that Sutskever had been concerned that Altman was pushing AI technology \u201ctoo far, too fast.\u201d But days after Altman\u2019s ouster, Sutskever had a change of heart: He signed an employee letter calling for the entire board to resign and for Altman to return, and later said he \u201cdeeply\u201d regretted his role in the dustup. Last month, Sutskever said he was leaving his role as chief scientist at OpenAI \u2014 one of a string of departures from the company around the same time \u2014 to work on \u201ca project that is very personally meaningful to me.\u201d It is not clear how Safe Superintelligence plans to translate a \u201csafer\u201d AI model into revenue or how its technology will manifest in the form of products. It\u2019s also not clear exactly what the new company thinks of as \u201csafety\u201d in the context of highly powerful artificial intelligence technology. But the company\u2019s launch reflects the belief among some in the tech world that artificial intelligence systems that are as smart as humans, if not smarter, are not some far-off science fiction dream but an impending reality that is not so far away. \u201cBy safe, we mean safe like nuclear safety as opposed to safe as in \u2018trust and safety,\u2019\u201d Sutskever told Bloomberg in an interview published Tuesday. Some employees who recently departed OpenAI had criticized it for prioritizing commercial growth over investing in long-term safety. One of those former employees, Jan Leike, last month raised alarms about OpenAI\u2019s decision to dissolve its \u201csuperalignment\u201d team, which was dedicated to training AI systems to operate within human needs and priorities. (OpenAI, for its part, said it was spreading superalignment team members throughout the company to better achieve safety objectives.) The launch announcement from Safe Superintelligence suggests that the company wants to take a different approach: \u201cOur singular focus means no distraction by management overhead or product cycles, and our business model means safety, security, and progress are all insulated from short-term commercial pressures.\u201d Joining Sutskever in launching the new company are Daniel Levy, who had worked at OpenAI for the past two years, and Daniel Gross, an investor who previously worked as a partner at the startup accelerator Y Combinator and on machine learning efforts at Apple. The company says it will have offices in Palo Alto, California, and Tel Aviv, Israel.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/tech/openai-ilya-sutskever-safe-super-intelligence-new-company/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "business"}}
