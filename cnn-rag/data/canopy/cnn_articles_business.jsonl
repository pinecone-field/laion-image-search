The US Financial Stability Oversight Council, a SWAT team of financial regulators formed after the 2008 crisis, sounded the alarm on Friday about an increasingly influential corner of the industry that has largely escaped scrutiny: nonbank mortgage companies. Unlike traditional banks, nonbank mortgage companies are heavily exposed to swings in the mortgage market, depend on funding that can dry up during times of stress and don\u2019t have stable deposits to rely on as a safety net. And, unlike banks, these companies are lightly regulated at the national level. FSOC warned that these unique vulnerabilities risk a domino effect in a future crisis where multiple mortgage companies fail, borrowers are locked out of the mortgage market and the federal government is left holding the bag. \u201cPut simply, the vulnerabilities of nonbank mortgage companies can amplify shocks in the mortgage market and undermine financial stability,\u201d Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who chairs FSOC, said in the report. Federal regulators are calling for states and Congress to take action to address the risks posed here, including creating an industry-funded backstop to ease turmoil caused when a mortgage company goes under. Despite the wonky term, nonbank mortgage companies have become vital players that make most home mortgages in the United States today. They include major brands such as Rocket Mortgage, PennyMac and Mr. Cooper. As of 2022, nonbank mortgage companies originated about two-thirds of US mortgages and owned the servicing rights on 54% of mortgage balances, according to FSOC. That\u2019s up significantly from 2008. In fact, nonbank mortgage servicers hold the servicing rights on nearly $6.3 trillion in unpaid balances on agency-backed mortgages \u2014 representing 70% of the total. Nonbank mortgage companies have \u201cvulnerabilities\u201d that could cause them to \u201camplify and transmit the effect of a shock to the mortgage market and broader financial system,\u201d FSOC said. For example, if home prices crash in a future crisis, mortgage companies could simultaneously lose money and face cash crunches that would make it hard for them to make required payments to investors on behalf of struggling borrowers, FSOC said. These challenges would be exacerbated by the relatively high amounts of debt these companies have. This pressure on nonbank mortgage companies would then hurt borrowers seeking mortgages and could force the federal government to assume the obligations, according to regulators. Plea for action Yellen and her colleagues on Friday called for state regulators to enhance requirements and standards on nonbank mortgage companies, including requiring them to map out how they could be safely wound down in a crisis. To address liquidity pressure during a time of stress, regulators called for Congress to consider legislation to provide new authorities to Ginnie Mae to expand an assistance backdrop program. Additionally, regulators said Congress should consider establishing a fund \u2014 financed by nonbank mortgage companies \u2014 to \u201cprovide liquidity to nonbank mortgage servicers that are in bankruptcy or have reached the point of failure.\u201d In response, the Mortgage Bankers Association, an industry trade group, said it supports FSOC\u2019s goals of a \u201csafe, stable and sustainable financial services marketplace\u201d but described some of the recommendations as \u201cunnecessary.\u201d \u201cYears of punitive regulatory capital treatment have already limited the willingness and ability of depository institutions to participate in the mortgage lending and servicing markets,\u201d Bob Broeksmit, president and CEO of the MBA, said in a statement on Friday. \u201cWhile we support national standards for capital and liquidity requirements, layering duplicative supervision requirements or supervisory entities onto a heavily regulated market will add significant cost and complexity.\u201d The ABA warned that managing these changes could reduce competition and raise borrowing costs. Scott Olsen, executive director of Community Home Lenders of America, another trade group, said the FSOC report does not indicate significant taxpayer risk and only limited risk to the financial system as a whole. \u201cGiven the current homeownership affordability challenges, CHLA hopes regulators do not overreact to this limited risk with regulations and fees that restrict mortgage access to credit,\u201d Olsen said in a statement. Even some regulators have concerns about the new FSOC plan. Brandon Milhorn, president and CEO of the Conference of State Bank Supervisors, cautioned in a statement on Friday that the recommendation to establish a new liquidity fund is \u201cpremature at best.\u201d \u201cBefore considering any such proposal, Congress should require substantially more research and analysis regarding the potentially dramatic, unintended consequences of this recommendation,\u201d Milhorn said. \u201cI am concerned that this recommendation could negatively impact the nonbank mortgage market, particularly for low- and moderate-income borrowers, communities of color, first-time homebuyers, and veterans.\u201d However, Patricia McCoy, a professor at Boston College Law School, cautioned that nonbank mortgage companies\u2019 reliance on short-term loans for financing \u201cmakes them vulnerable to collapse\u201d if borrowing rates spike or lending dries up. \u201cNonbank mortgage firms are thinly capitalized, which makes them vulnerable to failure if they lose financing or mortgage defaults spike,\u201d said McCoy, a former mortgage regulator. \u201cStarting in early 2007, we saw a tsunami of nonbank mortgage firms fail precisely for these reasons.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/economy/mortgage-company-risk-regulation-fsoc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "business"}}

Simons was 86 years old. Simons, the founder of the hedge fund Renaissance Technologies, helped to pioneer quantitative investing, a market strategy that relies on mathematical and statistical models to identify investing opportunities. Later in life, Simons became a political donor and philanthropist. Simons had a love for math and numbers from an early age, according to his foundation\u2019s website. Born in Newton, Massachusetts, in 1938, Simons earned a mathematics degree at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a doctorate in math from the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cMathematics was the only subject I liked,\u201d Simons said in a 2015 interview for the Numberphile podcast. After a brief stint teaching at MIT and Harvard University, Simons joined the Institute for Defense Analyses in Princeton, New Jersey, working as a code breaker for the National Security Agency. According to his foundation, Simons was fired from the institute in 1968 due to his opposition to the Vietnam War. Simons then joined the faculty at Stony Brook University as the head of the school\u2019s mathematics department. Simons left the academic world in the late \u201970s, eventually founding Renaissance Technologies in 1982. \u201cIn looking at the patterns of prices, I could see that there was something we could study here and that there were ways to predict prices mathematically and statistically,\u201d Simons said on the Numberphile podcast. \u201cGradually, we built models, and the models got better and better.

{"id": "2024_03_26_media_nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash", "text": "Cesar Conde has a decision to make \u2014 and it\u2019s not an especially difficult one. The NBCUniversal News Group chair is facing a torrent of backlash from his own staff after greenlighting the hire of former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel as a paid network contributor. Over the last 24 hours, the most prominent and recognizable NBC News and MSNBC personalities have voiced strong displeasure with the company\u2019s decision to welcome McDaniel to \u201cthe team.\u201d And they\u2019re not doing it via anonymous comments to the press. They\u2019re doing it on the record on NBCU\u2019s own air. Chuck Todd broke the dam on Sunday\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with a set of candid comments about the hiring, and Rachel Maddow capped the flood of backlash Monday night with a blistering 30-minute monologue eviscerating the network\u2019s leadership for the \u201cinexplicable\u201d move. Suffice to say, NBCU News Group is in unprecedented territory. Never has a network\u2019s C-suite ever been so thoroughly flogged by its most high-profile stars in such no holds barred fashion. Saying that Conde simply has a crisis on his hands would be a contender for understatement of the year. It\u2019s a five-alarm fire at NBCU News Group, and one of Conde\u2019s own making. While NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown were most directly responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring, a decision that MSNBC boss Rashida Jones did not object to it at the time, the buck ultimately stops with Conde, who hold the real power at the Peacock Network. McDaniel\u2019s hiring could not have happened without Conde\u2019s blessing. It does not take a brilliant political mind with prescient foresight to understand that hiring McDaniel would ignite a firestorm of outrage \u2014 from both within 30 Rock and outside it. Conde, someone who ostensibly supports American democracy, should have rejected McDaniel\u2019s hiring on the grounds that NBCU News Group could not put someone on its payroll who tried to subvert the 2020 vote. As so many of NBCU\u2019s staffers have underscored, the objection to McDaniel is not that she is a Republican. It\u2019s not even that she is a Donald Trump-supporting Republican. It\u2019s that she was an active participant in the plot to overthrow the last presidential election. That is not to even mention McDaniel\u2019s years of demonizing the press, smearing the journalists who work at NBC News and MSNBC as she sought to destroy the credibility of the organization that she ran to after being chased out of the RNC. The notion put forward by NBC that it needed to hire McDaniel to bring its viewers \u201can insider\u2019s perspective on national politics and the future of the Republican Party\u201d is absurd. If that\u2019s the case, the network should move to hire free agents like Tucker Carlson or Candace Owens. They too have their hands on the pulse of the Republican Party. In fact, they represent much more of where the GOP stands today than McDaniel. So, using NBC\u2019s logic, why not hire them? (Spoiler: News organizations rightfully have established basic standards for paid contributors. Asking that your employees have a commitment to democracy, to the truth, and to basic decency is not a big ask.) But even if Conde has no allegiance to basic democratic principles, which this hire calls into question, given that he is known to be a political player who cares deeply about his own image in the press, he should have been wise enough to foresee that hiring McDaniel would be an ill-conceived move. How this did not occur to Conde is unfathomable and shows a tremendous lack of judgment. Even more bizarre is Conde\u2019s management, or lack thereof, since the controversy erupted. It was clear early on that his employees at NBC News and MSNBC did not support McDaniel\u2019s hiring. If that was not evident on Friday, it was clear as day on Sunday after \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d The network\u2019s employees were not only flabbergasted and demoralized by the move, but absolutely enraged by it. At that point, the writing should have been on the wall for Conde \u2014 as it was for every other media executive that I have spoken with over the last 24 hours. It is evident that McDaniel has no real future as an NBC analyst and the decision to bring her on as a contributor will have to be reversed. After all, which NBC or MSNBC program is going to invite her on after all of this? The only real question for Conde after the Sunday morning scolding should have been how he chose to back out of the deal in the least painful way possible. To be fully honest, I very much expected a Sunday evening announcement from NBC, one that would have earned praise from the company\u2019s staff and quickly been swept away by the rush of Trump news Monday morning. But no such announcement came. Instead, Conde has allowed the mess to spiral absolutely out of control. MSNBC\u2019s top stars hammered the network\u2019s leadership throughout the day Monday over the hire. NBC News\u2019 Guild blasted Conde, saying in a statement that under him the company had quietly laid off employees over the last month and instead chosen to \u201cprioritize an election denier over its reporters.\u201d The already severe crisis was allowed to blossom into one of the worst corporate public relations catastrophes in recent memory. All the while, Conde has remained silent. I asked his spokesperson, Stephen Labaton, on Monday whether the NBCU News Group boss had any comment on the situation. Does he have any regret? I didn\u2019t get an on-the-record response. Suffice to say, however, that what Conde does moving forward will say a lot about his character and commitment to democratic values. It will also say a lot about the NBCU News Group and what type of organization it is. In her biting monologue on Monday night, however, Maddow did offer Conde a way out of this mess. \u201cMistakes will be made,\u201d Maddow said.\u201dBut our resilience as a democracy is going to be recognizing when decisions are bad ones and reversing those bad decisions. Hearing legitimate criticism, responding to it, and correcting course. Not digging in. Not blaming others. Take a minute. Acknowledge that maybe it wasn\u2019t the right call.\u201d \u201cIt is a sign of strength, not weakness, to acknowledge when you are wrong,\u201d Maddow added. \u201cIt is a sign of strength. And our country needs us to be strong now.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/media/nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk", "text": "In a year of wild tech stories that has seen Elon Musk transform Twitter, cryptocurrency exchange FTX collapse and Silicon Valley Bank implode, this week\u2019s whiplash-inducing turmoil at OpenAI is among the most captivating. Sam Altman \u2014 the leader of one of the world\u2019s most influential AI companies, OpenAI, and perhaps the\u00a0most visible figure in the fledgling industry \u2014 was fired Friday night by the startup\u2019s directors in a surprise move. Less than five days later, he\u2019s back as the company\u2019s CEO, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. The series of extraordinary events unfolded just days after OpenAI held its\u00a0first-ever developer conference, where it laid out new, commercialized versions of its technology, including the option to customize its ChatGPT AI chatbot. If you\u2019re just catching up, here\u2019s what you missed from a week so incredible you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking the script could have been written by an early version of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Friday Around 3 p.m. ET, Altman joined a Google Meet call with most of OpenAI\u2019s board that had been convened by fellow co-founder and OpenAI chief scientist\u00a0Ilya Sutskever, during which Altman was fired and told that the news would soon be made public. Within the next half hour, the board also informed Greg Brockman, another co-founder and OpenAI president, that he would be removed from the board. Around 3:30 p.m. ET, OpenAI publicly announced that it had fired Altman over concerns that he was not always truthful with the board. The board said Mira Murati, the company\u2019s chief technology officer, would become interim CEO. OpenAI\u2019s strategic partners, including its biggest financial backer Microsoft, were also reportedly informed of Altman\u2019s ouster just minutes before the board\u2019s announcement. Hours after being fired, Altman posted on X that he \u201cloved working with such talented people\u201d and that he would have \u201cmore to say about what\u2019s next later.\u201d Brockman promptly quit. \u201cPlease don\u2019t spend any time being concerned. We will be fine,\u201d Brockman\u00a0said in a Friday post\u00a0on X. \u201cGreater things coming soon.\u201d A key factor in the CEO\u2019s firing was\u00a0tension between Altman, who favored developing AI\u00a0more aggressively, and members of the OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the unfolding events. Saturday Within 24 hours of Altman being fired, reports emerged that he and other ex-OpenAI loyalists were mulling plans for their own venture. OpenAI\u2019s board was also reportedly having second thoughts and considering asking the ousted CEO to return. Sunday By Sunday afternoon, Altman was\u00a0back at OpenAI\u2019s headquarters\u00a0\u2014 this time with a guest badge \u2014 to negotiate his potential return. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reportedly mediated the discussion. A 5 p.m. PT deadline was reportedly set for the board to agree to Altman\u2019s demands, including adding a seat for Microsoft, and reinstating him as CEO. But those talks broke down. As Sunday turned into Monday, Nadella tweeted that Altman, along with Brockman, would join Microsoft to run a new AI research group. At OpenAI, the group found a new interim CEO: Emmett Shear, the former CEO of Amazon\u2019s streaming service, Twitch. Murati would return to her role as OpenAI\u2019s chief technology officer. Monday In a post on X early Monday, Shear, who left his role at Twitch in March, described the chance to join OpenAI as \u201ca once-in-a-lifetime\u201d opportunity. He added that the company would hire an independent investigator to report on what happened in the lead-up to Altman\u2019s firing. But OpenAI employees were not convinced. More than 500 staffers signed an open letter calling on the company\u2019s board to resign and reinstate Altman and Brockman. They also threatened to follow the co-founders to Microsoft if their demands were not met. Altman posted on X, saying, \u201cwe have more unity and commitment and focus than ever before. we are all going to work together some way or other, and i\u2019m so excited. one team, one mission.\u201d The drama was far from over.\u00a0The Verge reported Monday afternoon\u00a0that Altman and Brockman could still return to OpenAI if the board members who fired him resign. And Nadella, speaking to CNBC, said he was \u201copen to both options\u201d when asked whether Altman would actually join Microsoft. \u201cLook, that is for the OpenAI board and management and the employees to choose,\u201d Nadella said. \u201cWe chose to explicitly partner with OpenAI and we want to continue to do so, and obviously, that depends on the people of OpenAI staying there or coming to Microsoft.\u201d Tuesday Altman\u00a0was reinstated late Tuesday as OpenAI\u2019s CEO, the company said on X. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman\u00a0wrote\u00a0that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his\u00a0post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it has backed with billions to bolster its ambitions in developing AI. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Nadella\u00a0said\u00a0on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_13_business_porsche-911-hybrid", "text": "Porsche is set to unveil one of the biggest changes to its signature model. A hybrid Porsche 911, with its gas engine assisted by at least one battery-powered electric motor, will officially be revealed in an online event on May 28. The move is a major step in the evolution of one of the most recognizable sports cars in the world and helps support the acceptance of electric motors across most vehicles. Given their generally greater fuel efficiency without the sacrifice of power, hybrids have become commonplace in many types of vehicles. Porsche itself already sells plug-in hybrid models like the Cayenne e-Hybrid SUV and Panamera e-Hybrid four-door car but a hybrid 911 is another matter. Few cars are as defined by a gasoline engine as the 911 and few automakers are as defined by one model as Porsche is by the 911. While Porsche sells far more SUVs than sports cars these days, the 911 remains the automaker\u2019s core model. Even the Porsche Macan and Cayenne SUVs, with their rounded edges and sloped hoods, have nods in their designs to the 911. Porsche also sells fully electric cars, the Taycan and the new Macan Electric SUV. But executives have said the 911 would be the last Porsche to become all-electric because its engineering is so unique and quintessential to its brand. By taking away the engine in the back \u2014 giving it the distinctive shape and rear-weighted driving feel \u2014 what makes it a 911? This new hybrid model will be the closest Porsche can get to an electric 911 without raising those sorts of philosophical questions. The hybrid 911 has already undergone more than 3 million miles of testing on tracks and public roads in various climates, according to Porsche, but the more practical details won\u2019t be announced until the end of this month. For instance, Porsche would not say whether the car will be a plug-in hybrid, as past and current Porsche hybrids have been. Porsche has favored plug-in hybrids because their more powerful batteries add to performance. But we do know the hybrid 911 is clearly faster than the current purely gas-powered 911. A Porsche test driver was able to take the hybrid around Germany\u2019s famed N\u00fcrburgring Nordschleife racetrack in 7 minutes and 17 seconds \u2014 8.7 seconds faster than a comparable current-generation 911. The faster time indicates the hybrid 911 has greater power due to the addition of electric assistance. The N\u00fcrburgring is a twisty, challenging track so the faster time also indicates the car\u2019s handling isn\u2019t hindered by the added weight of batteries and electric motors. \u201cWe have more grip, significantly more power, and the spontaneous response of the performance hybrid is a great advantage,\u201d\u00a0former racing driver and \u201cbrand ambassador\u201d J\u00f6rg Bergmeister said in a statement. The announcement of the new hybrid version comes about 60 years after Porsche launched the 911. The first 911 was unveiled in 1963 but didn\u2019t go into production until 1964. It was a larger and more powerful addition to Porsche\u2019s original model \u2014 the 356. Both models, which were produced together for only a few years, had small back seats and engines mounted behind the rear wheels. The layout was similar to the Volkswagen Beetle, a car designed by Ferdinand Porsche Sr., the father of Ferdinand \u201cFerry\u201d Porsche, who created the 356. Ferry\u2019s son, Ferdinand \u201cButzi\u201d Porsche, worked on the design of the 911, modeled after the 356\u2019s teardrop shape.

That\u2019s thanks to the central bank\u2019s decision Wednesday to once again hold it steady, as it has done at the policy-making committee\u2019s past five meetings. That decision may be disappointing to some investors, homebuyers and those with a lot of credit card debt, since movement in the Fed\u2019s overnight lending rate influences rates \u2014 directly or indirectly \u2014 on consumer financial products (e.g., credit cards, bank loans and mortgages). But\u00a0with the Fed signaling that no rate cuts are likely until summer, it also means anyone with savings still has at least a few more months to make hay of their stash. That\u2019s because you can still get inflation-beating interest rates that will grow any money you have set aside for emergencies, vacations, down payments or any other goal in your sights over the next several years. However, that won\u2019t happen if you just let it sit in a traditional checking or savings account that yields next to nothing. There are more lucrative, low-risk options out there, with rates that are still at or near their peaks. \u201cBut perhaps not for much longer,\u201d said Ted Rossman, senior analyst at Bankrate. \u201cIf one of those fits into your financial plans, it\u2019s best to act soon.\u201d So, consider the following options when deciding where to park your hard-earned savings. High-yield online savings accounts The average annual percentage yield on bank savings accounts was just 0.52% as of March 13, according to Bankrate. That average is kept low by the biggest brick-and-mortar banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, which still are offering a paltry 0.01%. By contrast, there are still FDIC-insured online banks offering inflation-beating rates of between 4.35% and 5.35% on their high-yield savings accounts. Generally speaking, these are the best vehicles in which to keep your emergency funds for quick, easy access. Choosing between an account that pays 0.52% and one that pays 5.35% can mean forfeiting hundreds of dollars in interest. \u201cIf you put $10,000 in a savings account, that\u2019s a difference of $496 in interest earnings over the course of the year, assuming monthly compounding,\u201d Rossman said. While the rates on high-yield savings accounts have gone down a bit in recent months, \u201cwidespread cuts in online savings account rates are unlikely until the first Fed rate cut is near,\u201d said Ken Tumin, founder of DepositAccounts.com. As with any bank savings rate, high-yield savings account\u00a0rates\u00a0can change overnight, and the bank may not alert you when it lowers it. So make sure to check your monthly statement. Certificates of deposits Another high-return, low-risk investment that is great for money you likely won\u2019t need to tap for a few months or even a couple of years is a certificate of deposit. You can get the best returns on CDs through a brokerage such as Schwab, E*Trade or Fidelity. That\u2019s because you can comparison shop for CDs from any number of FDIC-insured banks and will not have to set up individual accounts with each institution. As of March 13, the average rate on a one-year CD was 1.95%, but some banks are offering as much are 5.4%. If you can get a one-year CD at, say, 5.4%, you will make $540 on a $10,000 investment. To get the greatest benefit from a CD, you have to leave the money invested for a fixed period. You can always access your principal sooner if you need to, but there may be early withdrawal penalties. As of March 20, CDs listed on Schwab.com with durations from three months up to three years were all yielding between 5.2% and 5.51%. CD rates on durations between four and 10 years ranged from 4.40% to 5.15%. Say you invest $10,000 in a one-year CD with a 5.36%\u00a0APY. At the end of that period, you\u2019d get your principal back plus $536 in interest when the CD matures, according to Bankrate\u2019s CD calculator. If you chose a two-year CD at 5.25%, you\u2019d bank an extra $1,078, assuming compounding interest. The same investment in a five-year CD at 5.15% would earn $2,854. \u201cIt makes sense to go long with CDs. To hedge your bets, include terms from one to five years. Starting a CD ladder will provide this mix,\u201d Tumin said. If you don\u2019t go through a brokerage you may get a reasonable deal from your primary bank, Tumin said. For example, he noted, Wells Fargo is still offering up to 5.01% on both 4-month and 7-month CDs. Or, at Bank of America, you can get up to 4.75% on a 7-month CD. But Tumin cautions that with any big bank CD you should take your money out at the end of the term, otherwise your bank may automatically renew it and lock you in to a much lower-yielding CD. Money market accounts and funds If you don\u2019t want to set up an online savings account at another bank, your own bank may offer you a money market deposit account that pays a higher yield than your regular checking or savings accounts. Money market accounts may have higher minimum deposit requirements than a regular savings account, but they are more liquid than a fixed-term certificate of deposit or Treasury bill, meaning they give you access to your money more quickly while still potentially giving you some of the highest yields available, said Doug Ornstein, senior manager for integrated solutions at TIAA Wealth Management. But don\u2019t confuse money market accounts with money market mutual funds, which invest in short-term, low-risk debt instruments. As of March 19, they had an average 7-day yield of 5.14%, according to the Crane Money Fund Index, which tracks the top 100 taxable money market funds. Unlike money market deposit accounts, money market mutual funds are not insured by the FDIC. But if you invest in a money market fund through a brokerage, your overall account is likely to be insured through the Securities Investor Protection Corp, which offers protection in the event your brokerage ever goes under. Treasury bills and notes Another option for money you can leave untouched anywhere from several months to a few years is to buy short-term Treasury bills and medium-term notes, which are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. Three- and six-month bills had yields of 5.39% and 5.33%\u00a0respectively on March 20 before the Fed\u2019s meeting ended, while nine-month and one-year bills were offering 5.19% and 5.08%\u00a0respectively, according to rates posted on Schwab.com for a $25,000 investment. Rates on Treasury notes with durations from two years to 10 years ranged between 4.29% and 4.72%. If you\u2019re someone who manages your portfolio like a hawk, you may feel comfortable buying T-bills on your own from TreasuryDirect.gov. But if you don\u2019t, it might be easier just to buy new issues through your brokerage account or invest in a short-term bond index fund or ETF, said Andy Smith, executive director of financial planning at Edelman Financial Engines. And if you\u2019re looking at money that will be needed in three to five years, you might consider a diversified fund of highly rated government and corporate bonds, Ornstein said. An 18-month AAA-rated corporate bond, for instance, was yielding 4.82% this week, while the three-year was at 4.49%. Meanwhile, three-year AAA-rated municipal bonds (which are issued by local governments) had a rate of 3.98%, according to Schwab.com. Don\u2019t chase yield When deciding on the best accounts and investments for your specific goals and peace of mind, it may pay to consult a fee-only fiduciary adviser \u2014 meaning, someone who doesn\u2019t get paid a commission to sell you a particular investment. What you\u2019ll always want to do is build in flexibility for yourself so you can easily access cash, regardless of your timeline for key goals. \u201cWhat happens if something changes and you need that down payment a lot sooner \u2014 or your parents need medical care fast?\u201d Smith said. That means balancing your desire for great yield with a need and desire for ease of access without penalty. Translation: Don\u2019t chase yield for yield\u2019s sake. Think of it this way, Ornstein said: Unless you have huge sums to invest or are an institutional investor, the difference between getting a 5.1% yield versus 5% is negligible, and in fact it could even cost you more if there are penalties for taking your money out early. \u201cMost of the time convenience is really important. Give up the 0.1%,\u201d he advised.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/20/success/interest-rates-savings-cash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_27_media_nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over", "text": "Only 80 hours elapsed between NBC News announcing Ronna McDaniel as a paid contributor and the network ousting her from that very role. But for the leadership at NBC Universal News Group, those were 80\u00a0painful hours. On Tuesday evening, following another full day in which the media rumor mill churned at warp speed, NBCU News Group boss Cesar Conde sent staff a memo, notifying his troops that he had reversed his decision to welcome the former Republican National Committee chair to \u201cthe team.\u201d \u201cAfter listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor,\u201d Conde said, adding that he wanted to \u201cpersonally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down.\u201d Conde had no real choice. The embattled NBCU boss, who I\u2019m told dealt with the crisis from an unknown location outside of 30 Rock, was facing an unprecedented rebellion from his most high-profile stars, who one by one went on the air and excoriated leadership\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel. The only aspect of Conde\u2019s note that was surprising was the fact that it came 48 hours late, allowing what started off as a crisis to fester and balloon into one of the worst corporate public relations calamities in recent memory. \u201cWhat a sh*t show!\u201d a media executive exclaimed to me Tuesday shortly after Conde relieved McDaniel of her NBC News credentials. In his note, Conde said he took \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for McDaniel\u2019s hire. But, he also did point the finger, telling staffers that hiring her was \u201ca collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team.\u201d Indeed, multiple people familiar with the matter have told me that the infighting among NBC executives over who was at fault for the disaster has reached a fever pitch, with various factions of the NBCU News Group assigning blame to others. Regardless of who is to blame, the entire affair made clear who is actually in control of the company \u2014 and it\u2019s not Conde & Co. Despite the NBCU C-suite digging their heels in the sand as they resisted dumping McDaniel for days, they were ultimately forced to succumb to pressure from their talent. As a second media executive commented to me, it is now \u201cvery clear who is in charge\u201d after the \u201cweak leadership was put on full display.\u201d \u201cHas Cesar lost the room?\u201d wondered a third media executive. While the Peacock family argues over who was really at fault, the company is facing a fresh public relations mess. Led by Donald Trump, right-wing personalities are already assailing the network as being overrun with intolerant woke leftists. \u201cThese Radical Left Lunatics are CRAZY and the top people at NBC ARE WEAK,\u201d Trump raged on his Truth Social platform. Ari Fleischer, who served as press secretary under President George W. Bush, wrote on X: \u201cWhat NBC is saying is if you\u2019re for Trump, you don\u2019t belong. Good. Let NBC be for Democrats only.\u201d Of course, that narrative is intellectually dishonest. The objection to McDaniel from both within and outside of NBCU was not that she is a Republican. It wasn\u2019t even that she was a Trump-supporting Republican. No, the objection stemmed from the fact that McDaniel was an active participant in the plot to subvert the 2020 vote. And, in addition to that disgraceful history, she had a lengthy track record smearing NBC News and MSNBC. Nevertheless, NBCU will now have to contend with such dishonest attacks being leveled by the right, which will follow them in the days, months, and even years to come. As unfair as it may be, they will certainly damage the network\u2019s brand in Republican circles \u2014 a place it had gone through great pains to appeal to. NBCU will also have to grapple with McDaniel, who spent the last 24 hours or so interviewing lawyers as she gears up for a possible legal fight with the network, according to a person familiar with the matter. The rift between McDaniel and NBCU had grown to such an extent by Tuesday that she was not informed by network brass that she had been dismissed, I\u2019m told. Instead, McDaniel learned of her ouster in press reports. While NBCU is being beaten up on the right, the company\u2019s leadership was quickly praised by its journalists and top stars. Shortly after Conde sent out his memo, Rachel Maddow appeared on Joy Reid\u2019s show, where the two lauded Conde for reversing course. \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/27/media/nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_13_investing_melinda-gates-resigns-foundation", "text": "Melinda French Gates,\u00a0one of the world\u2019s preeminent philanthropists, said Monday she would resign as co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation that she has helped lead since 2000. The foundation has made nearly $78 billion worth of grant payments in the nearly 25 years since its founding. French Gates made the decision \u201cafter considerable reflection, based on how she wants to spend the next chapter of her philanthropy,\u201d the foundation\u2019s CEO, Mark Suzman, wrote in a statement Monday. \u201cMelinda has new ideas about the role she wants to play in improving the lives of women and families in the U.S. and around the world. And, after a difficult few years watching women\u2019s rights rolled back in the U.S. and around the world, she wants to use this next chapter to focus specifically on altering that trajectory.\u201d As part of her separation agreement from former husband Bill Gates, French Gates said she will receive an additional $12.5 billion for her charitable work. \u201cThis is not a decision I came to lightly,\u201d she said in a statement posted on X. \u201cI am immensely proud of the foundation that Bill and I built together and of the extraordinary work it is doing to address inequities around the world.\u201d French Gates said she plans to leave the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation on June 7, and she will share more about her future charitable plans in the near future. The organization will change its name to the Gates Foundation, and Bill Gates will become the sole chair, Suzman said. \u201cI am sorry to see Melinda leave, but I am sure she will have a huge impact in her future philanthropic work,\u201d wrote Bill Gates in a separate statement Monday, also posted on X. \u201cLooking ahead, I remain fully committed to the Foundation\u2019s work across all our strategies, and to realizing the opportunities we have to continue improving the lives of millions around the world,\u201d he wrote. French Gates\u2019 planned exit French Gates\u2019 exit had been telegraphed for several years. Bill Gates and French Gates announced their divorce in May 2021. They said at the time they would allow themselves a kind of trial period through 2023 to determine if they could continue working with one another to oversee their massive charitable foundation. Suzman announced in July 2021 a contingency plan \u201cto ensure the continuity of the foundation\u2019s work.\u201d \u201cIf after two years either decides they cannot continue to work together as co-chairs, French Gates will resign her position as co-chair and trustee,\u201d Suzman said. Gates will remain in control and, essentially, buy French Gates out of the foundation, Suzman said at the time. French Gates would receive \u201cpersonal resources\u201d from Gates for her own philanthropic work \u2014 resources that would be \u201ccompletely separate from the foundation\u2019s endowment.\u201d In January 2022, the foundation announced four new members to its board of trustees to help bolster\u00a0the foundation\u2019s governance in the wake of the divorce. It marked the first time the Gates foundation added outsiders to the charity\u2019s board in its two-decade history. The charity had no trustees beside Bill and Melinda French Gates since Bill Gates Sr.\u2019s death in 2020 and Warren Buffett\u2019s\u00a0resignation\u00a0in June 2021 after 15 years on the board. \u201cI want to reassure you that the millions of people our work serves and the thousands of partners we work alongside can continue to count on the foundation,\u201d said Suzman in a post on the foundation\u2019s website Monday afternoon. \u201cThe foundation today is stronger than it has ever been.\u201d \u201cI know we all wish Melinda the best in her next chapter,\u201d he added, noting that French Gates \u201cwill not be bringing any of the foundation\u2019s work with her when she leaves.\u201d Giving it all away The $75.2 billion Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation\u2019s mission is to improve health care in developing countries, enhance educational opportunities and reduce poverty by providing grants and support to various initiatives and organizations around the world. French Gates also founded Pivotal Ventures, a separate charity that focuses on removing barriers for minorities and women in the United States, in 2015. She committed $1 billion to the organization in 2019. The Microsoft cofounder and French Gates have both pledged to donate the vast majority of their wealth to the foundation\u00a0as well as to other philanthropic endeavors. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Fareed Zakaria in January, Gates said he and partners like Buffett have given away about $100 billion into the foundation. With plans to spend $9 billion a year, Gates anticipates he\u2019ll have given away all of his money in about 20 years.

You can sign up\u00a0right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link. Gen Z is in the financial trenches. A new study from credit reporting agency TransUnion found those in their early 20s are earning less, have more debt and see higher delinquency rates than Millennials did at their age. The findings outline the credit usage of 22 to 24 year old Gen Zers. Millennials who fell in that age range in 2013 were asked about their credit usage during that period. Gen Zers are defined as those born between 1995 and 2012, and Millennials as those born between 1980 and 1994. Gen Zers, like Millennials, have had to deal with economic calamities early in their careers. For Gen Z, it was the Covid-19 pandemic. For Millennials, it was the global financial crisis. But the current generation of early 20-somethings have another challenge: sticky inflation that\u2019s driven up prices of everything from gas at the pump to food at the grocery store. Interest rates perched at a 23-year high have also hiked borrowing rates for auto loans, student loans and mortgages. This isn\u2019t a problem completely unique to early-career consumers. The entire US credit economy has seen higher debt levels and delinquencies across most credit products. A separate TransUnion report found that Americans\u2019 total credit card balance topped $1 trillion for the first time in 2023. But because Gen Zers are early in their credit journeys, it is important for them to establish healthy habits now that will help them down the road, experts say. Before the Bell spoke with Charlie Wise, head of global research and consulting at TransUnion, to discuss Gen Zers\u2019 financial situation and what they can do to improve it. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Why are we seeing that Gen Z is tapping into their credit more than their Millennial counterparts 10 years ago? If you think about prices and the cost of living, a lot of what we\u2019ve seen elevated are the things that Gen Z are most likely going to be spending a good portion of their income on. Rent being a huge piece, and we\u2019ve seen double digit increases in rents over the last several years. But even things like food, dining out, gas prices, prices for automobiles and transportation. All of those have seen significant increases. Most Gen Z consumers are not homeowners. They\u2019re renters or living with family or friends. But in those cases where they\u2019re renters, they\u2019re seeing that additional bite that certainly those homeowners that have their homes prior to 2022 haven\u2019t faced. You own your home, your mortgage typically doesn\u2019t vary, but your rent does. And so I think that\u2019s been a big cause of what\u2019s been driving a lot of that financial strain that Gen Z consumers have seen. Do you have any advice for Gen Zers who may find themselves in a difficult financial situation? One of those things that consumers need to realize is, yes, not everybody has the means to pay off their credit cards in full every month. But the cycle of continuing to spend on your credit cards and just paying off the minimums will create opportunities for you to continue to accumulate debt. And it\u2019s going to take a very long time to pay off your credit card balances just paying the minimums every month, particularly if you continue to use those cards. So, understanding what you can afford, what you can spend on (is important). In some cases, consumers have very high debt levels. The opportunity to refinance credit card debt with a less expensive form of debt. Personal loans are a good option for that. You\u2019re forced to make a material payment every month, and consumers can consolidate their credit card debt onto a cheaper form. Over a course of a couple of years, they can pay that off. The key is to not use the personal loans to pay off credit card debt and then run your credit card bills right back up after you do that. Is it fair to say that there is cause for concern when it comes to Gen Z\u2019s financial health, but the situation is more of a wait-and-see than a crisis? I think that\u2019s a very correct assessment. Again, we\u2019ve seen that average credit card balances per consumer, are, even inflation adjusted, 26% higher than they were for Millennials a decade ago. So this is a consumer that has increasingly turned to debt. But even with the higher delinquency levels that we\u2019re seeing, we don\u2019t think that this is necessarily a cause for alarm. Certainly with Gen Z consumers, they are potentially at a stage in their careers where they may see fairly material and rapid salary increases as they go from that first job, either get promoted or take on (other) roles within their organizations or look for new jobs where they have increased earnings opportunities. But at the same time \u2026 make sure that again, you\u2019re borrowing and spending within your means. UK exits recession in \u2018fragile\u2019 recovery ahead of election The United Kingdom has come out of a short and shallow recession, giving Prime Minister Rishi Sunak a sorely needed boost ahead of an election expected later this year, report my colleagues Hanna Ziady and Anna Cooban. Gross domestic product grew 0.6% in the first three months of the year compared with the previous quarter, data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed Friday. The increase follows falls of 0.3% in the fourth quarter and 0.1% in the third quarter of last year. A recession is commonly defined as two consecutive quarters of economic contraction. The expansion early this year was driven by \u201cwidespread growth\u201d in the dominant service sector, where output ticked up 0.7% during the quarter after dipping late last year, the ONS said. According to projections published Thursday, the Bank of England now expects UK GDP to grow 0.5% this year, double the pace it forecast in February. By comparison, last year, GDP increased by a measly 0.1%. There are other signs the economy\u2019s prospects are brightening. In April, combined output in manufacturing and services recorded the strongest rise in almost a year, according to a survey of purchasing managers compiled by S&P Global. Again, service firms drove the expansion. However, compared with its peers, the UK economy is faring less well. Read more here.

{"id": "2024_05_11_business_florida-a-and-m-pauses-donation", "text": "Florida A&M University is putting a purported $237.75 million donation \u201con pause,\u201d after media reports and college board leaders raised concerns about the actual value of the stock gift\u2014and the details surrounding the donor\u2019s previous donations. \u201cA decision that was made yesterday to put a pause on this activity\u2014a hold, is more or less, is the language that was used\u2014pending some additional information that has come to my attention,\u201d FAMU President Larry Robinson said Thursday during an emergency school board meeting, called after media reports and school leaders raised concerns about the legitimacy of the gift. It\u2019s a stunning reversal from the fanfare last Saturday at FAMU\u2019s commencement ceremony, when the announcement of the gift made headlines as one of the largest ever personal donations ever to a historically Black college or university. Gregory Gerami, the 30-year-old CEO of Texas hydroponic hemp farm company Batterson Farms Corp., presented the $237.75 million stock gift via an oversized, ceremonial check to university administration members including Robinson, who called the gift \u201cbreathtaking in its generosity and its scope\u201d via a\u00a0press release\u00a0the day of the donation. But the jubilance quickly gave way to skepticism. A\u00a0report\u00a0from Politico noted Batterson Farms Corp.\u202fis a comparatively small company, and that its private shares are unlikely to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. In 2020, a notable deal involving a donor later identified as Gerami fell apart. South Carolina\u2019s Coastal Carolina University had announced a $95 million donation from an anonymous donor, who then backed out months later. An investigation by the\u00a0Myrtle Beach Sun News\u00a0identified Gerami in a story that noted, among other details, that he backed out alleging racism from CCU officials\u2014an allegation they denied. At\u00a0an\u00a0emergency board meeting on Thursday, FAMU\u00a0board\u00a0of trustee\u00a0and foundation members expressed\u00a0their concerns and frustration about the school\u2019s vetting process involving Gerami\u2019s donation. Several members of the FAMU Foundation Board of Directors and Deveron Gibbons, the vice chair of the university\u2019s Board of Trustees, said they were not informed of the donation until it was announced at commencement. \u201cThis meeting is taking place because no one, as I am aware of from this conversation, had any clue this was going on,\u201d Gibbons told CNN.\u00a0\u201cWe are talking about a transformational, largest in HBCU history donation: big check on stage, with press involved and big PR campaign push after the fact. If that doesn\u2019t show that we need to take a step back and get our own house in order, I\u202fdon\u2019t know what else does.\u201d Gibbons has called for an independent investigation into the transaction. \u201cI hope that this is a good gift. It could be transformative for the university and much needed. But we must vet the process, doing an announcement is not the first thing you do \u2026 Vet the individual. You vet the donation,\u201d Vice Chair Gibbons said. Board Chair Kristin Harper provided a statement to CNN on Friday saying, \u201cSerious concerns have been raised regarding the validity of the gift, the adequacy of the due diligence processes and whether the Foundation Board and Board of Trustees have been provided ample oversight opportunity.\u201d \u201cI regrettably share these concerns\u201d Harper added. On May 5, just one day after the announcement at commencement, FAMU released a\u202fstatement via X (formerly Twitter)\u202finsisting the university had done its \u201cdue diligence.\u201d The statement went on to say that Gerami had transferred $237,750,000 of stocks into a FAMU account last month. A non-disclosure agreement requested by Gerami prohibited officials from disclosing the details to either the university\u2019s board of trustees or the board of directors, Vice President for University Advancement Shawnta Friday-Stroud said during an emergency meeting Thursday. \u201cIn addition to the wealth screening that was done at the beginning, we did a more expansive screening of Mr. Gerami\u2019s\u00a0background,\u201d Friday-Stroud said. \u201cWe had a discussion with Dr. Robinson, all of which has been put out on social media. We said, \u2018ok, we will proceed with the decision to move forward,\u201d Friday-Stroud added. \u201cMy concern is our reputation has been greatly impacted and I want to make sure that we restore faith in our alumni and all of the friends and family that support Florida A&M University,\u201d said FAMU Foundation Board member Terry Arnold. When reached by CNN on Thursday, Gerami declined immediate comment.\u00a0\u202fHe referred questions to the university and agreed to answer CNN\u2019s questions on the following day, but he couldn\u2019t be reached. FAMU\u2019s Special Board of Trustees, which oversees the full school and the foundation, has\u202fscheduled a\u00a0meeting for May 15\u00a0to discuss the donation. FAMU\u2019s communications department did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on more detailed questions about the gift and the nature of the vetting process.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/11/business/florida-a-and-m-pauses-donation/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_13_business_shein-75-hour-weeks-investigation", "text": "More than a year after Shein promised to tackle excessive working hours in its supply chain, a new report suggests the Chinese fast-fashion company still has a problem. Workers in some factories supplying Shein are still working 75-hour weeks,\u00a0according to an investigation by Public Eye, a Swiss human rights advocacy group that first highlighted the alleged abuse back in 2021. \u201cThe 75-hour weeks that we found out about two years ago still seem to be common at Shein,\u201d the Swiss organization said. Public Eye interviewed 13 textile workers employed at six factories in Guangzhou, a region in southern China, last summer. It found that staff worked an average of 12 hours a day, excluding lunch and dinner breaks, and usually for six or seven days a week. Shein does not reveal the identity of its suppliers, Public Eye said in its report. The group said it established that the factories were Shein suppliers through interviewees\u2019 responses as well as the presence of Shein products. Public Eye also claimed that workers\u2019 wages had hardly changed since its 2021 report. They fluctuated between 6,000 and 10,000 yuan per month ($829 and $1,382). However, after deducting pay for overtime, wages fell to about 2,400 ($332) a month. That\u2019s\u00a0well below the 6,512 yuan ($900) Public Eye says is a living wage in China, citing calculations by campaign group the Asia Floor Wage Alliance. \u201cI work every day from 8 in the morning to 10.30 at night and take one day off each month. I can\u2019t afford any more days off because it costs too much,\u201d Public Eye cited one worker as saying. Shein is\u00a0an online shopping retailer\u00a0founded in 2008 that sells its cut-price fast fashion apparel all over the world. In a statement to CNN the company said that it does \u201cnot recognize many of the allegations in (Public Eye\u2019s) report.\u201d \u201cThe Public Eye report is based on a sample of 13 interviewees and, though all voices in our supply chain are important, this small sample size should be seen in the context of our comprehensive ongoing process to continually improve our supply chain, which involves engaging with thousands of suppliers and workers within the supply chain,\u201d it added. In December 2022, Shein\u00a0announced plans\u00a0to invest $15 million to upgrade hundreds of factories belonging to its suppliers. That announcement followed a documentary\u00a0broadcast by the UK\u2019s Channel 4 that made allegations of labor exploitation against two of Shein\u2019s suppliers in China, with factory staff allegedly working\u00a018 hours a day and making pennies per item. On Monday, it said it continued to make substantial investments to strengthen governance and compliance among its suppliers. \u201cThese efforts are already delivering results, with our regular supplier audits showing a consistent improvement in performance and compliance by our supplier partners,\u201d Shein said in its statement. A spokesperson for Shein told CNN that the company requires its suppliers to cap workers schedules at 60 hours per week, including overtime, and to give workers at least one day off a week. Staff also have the right to refuse to work overtime. Third-party audits carried out between April 2022 and June 2023 showed that workers at its suppliers earned basic salaries that were, on average, more than double the local minimum wage, and \u201cmuch higher\u201d than the living wage in Shenzhen, about 81 miles south of Guangzhou, the spokesperson added. Public Eye said it did not return to Nancun, near Guangzhou \u2014 where Shein has its headquarters \u2014 to interview workers as it had done in 2021, because an increase in media scrutiny in the area made \u201cthe atmosphere too risky.\u201d Some workers also told investigators that they had noticed an rise in the number of surveillance cameras in the factories, and believed that the recordings were sent to Shein in real time to help the firm enforce its rules. Shein\u2019s suppliers \u201cmake their own decision to install cameras in their facilities\u201d to enhance security, but that it \u201cdoes not have access to suppliers\u2019 security camera feeds or footage,\u201d the company spokesperson told CNN. Public Eye\u2019s investigators also observed young people, judged to be about 14 or 15 years old, performing simple tasks, such as packaging, in some of the factories. \u201cWe strictly do not tolerate child labor. We treat any violations with utmost severity,\u201d the spokesperson said, adding that \u201cany such violations found would result in the immediate termination of (the firm\u2019s) business relationship with the supplier.\u201d This article has been updated with additional information.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/business/shein-75-hour-weeks-investigation/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_11_business_applebees-chilis-mcdonalds-prices", "text": "McDonald\u2019s and other fast food chains are charging more. So much so that you may want to consider going for a slightly slower burger. Or at least, that\u2019s what Applebee\u2019s wants you to think about. \u201cYou can get our burger for $9.99,\u201d John Peyton, CEO of Applebee\u2019s parent company Dine Brands, told CNN in an interview. With that in mind, \u201cwhy would you take a $10 burger \u2026 that you can eat in a bag out of your car?\u201d If Peyton\u2019s sales pitch resonates with customers, it could help convince diners to eat at sit-down restaurants, something they might otherwise see as an indulgence. For a while, restaurant customers were trading down \u2014 swapping out expensive meals for cheaper ones, but still dining out. Now, some are responding to higher menu prices by trading out entirely: Instead of opting for cheaper restaurants or meals, they\u2019re eating more at home and spending less when they do go out. That means that restaurants have to battle it out for these cost-conscious consumers. And now, it\u2019s not just burger chain against burger chain. Because fast food joints have been hiking up prices in recent years, dine-in spots like Applebee\u2019s can run promotions that end up costing about the same as a fast food lunch \u2014 giving them a chance to try to steal those customers away. The overlap offers \u201ca new opportunity,\u201d according to Peyton. Lunch at McDonald\u2019s now costs about the same as lunch at Applebee\u2019s, where you can sit at a table and have your meal delivered by a server. Pointing that out is a new way to bid for customers. Applebee\u2019s, which has seen sales slump as lower-income customers pull back, is offering deals and hoping the prices will speak for themselves. Chili\u2019s, on the other hand, is making the comparison more explicit. For them, and the fast food chains they\u2019re now competing against, the stakes are high. A smaller pie Years of price hikes have\u00a0contributed to declining traffic, pushing restaurants to fight over fewer customers, according to David Henkes, a senior principal at Technomic, a food industry research and consulting firm. \u201cIt\u2019s a smaller pie today than it was a year ago,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re competing for a share of a smaller market. And so it is more competitive.\u201d Fast food prices, in particular, have shot up. \u201cFast food has gotten really expensive,\u201d Henkes said. \u201cCertainly, relative to where it was 12 to 18 months ago, and also in comparison to casual dining sit-down restaurants right now.\u201d In the 12 months through March, not adjusting for seasonal swings, prices at fast food and fast casual restaurants went up 5%, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In that period full-service menu prices went up 3.2%, and grocery prices ticked up 1.2%. A few years ago, McDonald\u2019s\u00a0said that it could raise prices without losing too many customers. But now, it\u2019s struggling with lower-income customers. CEO Chris Kempczinski said\u00a0during a February analyst call\u00a0that \u201cthe battle ground is certainly with that low-income consumer.\u201d The following month, CFO Ian Borden conceded\u00a0during another analyst call\u00a0that \u201cit\u2019s a challenging consumer environment.\u201d The chain is working on a $5 menu to win over those customers, according to Bloomberg. Things aren\u2019t much better over at Applebee\u2019s. Sales at US Applebee\u2019s locations open at least a year\u00a0slumped 4.6% in the first quarter. In that period, customers who earn $50,000 a year or less visited less often, and spent less when they did, Peyton said, adding that the demographic makes up about 45% of Applebee\u2019s customers. \u201cFor several quarters\u2026 we\u2019ve been asking ourselves, when will we see the impact of inflation, and the economy in general, and interest rates, on on our guest,\u201d he said. \u201cWe really began to see it in the first quarter.\u201d He added that \u201cwe think it\u2019s going to be a fight for share of wallet and market share all year.\u201d Fast food as a foil With fast food prices high, sit-down restaurants can make a case for themselves. People have taken their fast food price grievances to social channels, some complaining about the price of McDonald\u2019s burgers and hash browns. Chili\u2019s has been paying attention. \u201cOur social media team has been watching the conversation that the consumer is frustrated by fast food prices,\u201d said Kevin Hochman, president of Chili\u2019s and CEO of its parent company, Brinker International, during an April analyst call. In response, Chili\u2019s decided to run ads that \u201cuse fast food as a foil,\u201d he said. The chain said in an April press release that it was adding a new burger \u2014 which it described as having \u201ctwice the beef of a Big Mac and flavors fast food lovers will recognize\u201d \u2014 to its \u20183 for me\u2019 value menu. For $10.99, customers get the burger plus an app and a drink. On X, Chili\u2019s asked whether Chili\u2019s is better than fast food, and promised rewards to those who said yes. Chili\u2019s also ran video ads comparing its food favorably to fast food burgers. But it might not be that easy. Getting people to go to Chili\u2019s instead of McDonald\u2019s may be a stretch, said Henkes. One problem for chains like Chili\u2019s and Applebee\u2019s is that they\u2019re not so much competing on price, as they are on time. \u201cPeople go to sit-down restaurants, generally speaking, for different occasions, than they go to fast food restaurants,\u201d Henkes noted. You might expect to spend an hour at a Chili\u2019s or an Applebee\u2019s, and breeze right through a McDonald\u2019s. Still, campaigns like Chili\u2019s can help communicate to customers that these days its food is relatively cheap. \u201cPlanting that seed that, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re a good value,\u2019 I think is a good message to have,\u201d Henkes said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/11/business/applebees-chilis-mcdonalds-prices/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_13_investing_premarket-stocks-trading", "text": "A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business\u2019 Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up\u00a0right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link. Like it or not, most business leaders, analysts and economists agree that artificial intelligence will play an outsized role in shaping the future of the US economy. The next few years will be critical in defining the shape of the AI revolution, and economist and former dean of Columbia Business School Glenn Hubbard is worried the United States isn\u2019t ready to accept the disruptions that come along with it. Before the Bell spoke with Hubbard about what he sees as an increasingly dangerous problem that could stifle growth for years to come. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Why is this the right time to refocus on AI and economic growth? Growth is always the right answer. Anything we want to do as a society \u2014 if we want to fight climate change, if we want to rebuild our military, want to educate and train people \u2014 it\u2019s all about economic growth. So how come politicians aren\u2019t talking about this? Imagine I have a coin in my hand. The head side is growth, and we all think that\u2019s great. But the tail side is disruption. Economists believe that you can\u2019t have growth without disruption. And since our political class doesn\u2019t know how to handle disruption, they\u2019ve stopped talking about growth. A better idea might be to handle disruption \u2014 actually help people get trained, get educated, help communities, and yet that\u2019s disappeared off the radar screen. The fact that we are interested in growth is hardly a surprise. The big surprise is why we don\u2019t talk about it. I think the answer is that it\u2019s just hard for politicians. When you talk about disruption, are you talking about the job losses that will come with greater use of artificial intelligence? Think of two waves. Over the past three or four decades, technological change and some globalization has caused a slow-mo disruption of the job market and communities around the country. Now look at AI, we\u2019re going to have that same disruption except it\u2019s going to be much faster. We\u2019re talking about five years, not 30. And if we couldn\u2019t even handle the slow-mo, 30-year process, how are we going to do it in five? We really need to rethink how we manage change. Because of course we want the change from AI. The question is, how do you help people cope? Major CEOs are already talking about how they\u2019re implementing AI in their own businesses. Do we really need government help and intervention? I think it does require some government help because companies will certainly do what\u2019s in their own interest, which would be to become more efficient or use AI to revolutionize processes, but it\u2019s not up to me as a company to prepare my workers for another kind of job. That\u2019s just not my interest. So you do need public policy. I do think it\u2019s simple and we kind of know how to do this. It\u2019s arming community colleges, it\u2019s public-private partnerships between businesses and community colleges. It\u2019s not that we don\u2019t know what to do, but we need to do it. And of course, it\u2019s not going to be free either, the government would have to spend some money. A lot of people would argue that the Biden administration\u2019s CHIPS Act and Inflation Reduction Act have done a lot to increase spending and stimulate growth\u2026\u00a0 I would have gone higher and lower. The real role for government is massive support for basic research that could lead to the next generation of chips. The question is not about today, it\u2019s really about tomorrow. We\u2019re way underspending on R&D, and research is a lot better than writing checks to companies that already have a lot of money. We also need to target things we think are critical for national defense and protect those things. But we don\u2019t have a checkbook big enough to subsidize everything, that\u2019s not going to be the road to recovery. So we either need to go up and support research or go down and try to find narrow pockets to subsidize. Both the CHIPS Act and the Inflation Reduction Act have good headings and leads, but below that there\u2019s a lot of waste. Inflation is still above the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% target. Wouldn\u2019t prioritizing economic growth exacerbate the problem? Most of what I\u2019m suggesting isn\u2019t going to be a huge demand stimulus. It\u2019s more about supply side productivity, so a little bit less of a concern. But it is still the case that you don\u2019t want to keep expanding the deficit. Policymakers would need to make choices: You could raise some taxes or you cut some other spending. A massive tax hike isn\u2019t likely to happen during an election year\u2026 Yeah, I\u2019m not expecting any candidate to suggest that right now. But it\u2019s really an arithmetic problem. Payments on the national debt, which were essentially zero a couple of years ago, are now as big as defense spending. And so we really have to think this through and the next president is going to have to deal with it. He may not be campaigning on it, but whoever he is, he\u2019s going to have to do something about it. How does moving the focus away from growth hurt Americans\u2019 economic prospects?\u00a0 It will slow down productivity growth. Generative AI will probably be the biggest driver of productivity growth in the next decade or two, not so much because it\u2019s replacing jobs but it\u2019s adding to the productivity of a person. But it also means that we have to be willing to tolerate the fact that some firms will go out of business, some people will lose their jobs and other firms will get very big. Are we willing to do all those things? I would say fine, but I\u2019m not sure our political process is willing to do that. What will the long-term consequences be if the current trend continues?\u00a0 Social support for our system is unraveling and it\u2019s been unraveling for a while. There are many communities and many groups of individuals who don\u2019t really feel like contemporary capitalism is serving them well. And the longer we let that go, we\u2019re really running the risk of killing the golden goose. I don\u2019t even see why this would be unpopular. If I said, \u201cI\u2019m going to have a block grant for communities. I\u2019m going to boost community colleges,\u201d why is that bad? If I\u2019m a governor, I love it. If I\u2019m a mayor, I\u2019m loving it. I can\u2019t quite figure out why we can\u2019t get it done.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_13_tech_uber-lyft-massachusetts-trial", "text": "Uber\u00a0and Lyft\u00a0are set to face trial on Monday in a\u00a0US\u00a0lawsuit by Massachusetts\u2019 attorney general alleging the ride-share companies misclassified their drivers as independent contractors rather than more costly employees. The non-jury trial in Boston comes amid\u00a0broader legal and political battles\u00a0in the Democratic-led state and elsewhere nationally over the status of drivers for app-based companies whose rise has fueled the\u00a0US gig worker economy. Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell is asking a judge to conclude that drivers for\u00a0Uber\u00a0and Lyft are employees under state law and therefore entitled to benefits such as a minimum wage, overtime and earned sick time. Her office claims the companies for years misclassified thousands of Massachusetts drivers and cannot meet a three-part test under the state\u2019s worker-friendly laws that would allow them to be deemed independent contractors. Studies have shown that using contractors can cost companies\u00a0as much as 30% less\u00a0than using employees. Uber (UBER)\u00a0and Lyft (LYFT) argue that they properly classified the drivers, saying they are not transportation companies that employ drivers but technology companies whose apps facilitate connections between drivers and potential riders. The companies warn\u00a0that, should Suffolk County Superior Court Judge Peter Krupp rule against them, they would be unable to maintain\u00a0their\u00a0flexible business model in the state and may be forced to cut or cease operations in Massachusetts. Rohit Singla, a lawyer for Lyft, during a Thursday pre-trial hearing said his client\u2019s \u201ccurrent business cannot support drivers as employees, is not set up for that and wouldn\u2019t work that way.\u201d The case is going to trial a week after Massachusetts\u2019 highest court\u00a0heard arguments\u00a0over whether to allow an industry-backed ballot measure to go before voters in November that defines the drivers as contractors but entitles them to some new benefits. The court appeared open to allowing some version of that proposal to go on the ballot along with a rival, labor-backed ballot measure that seeks to allow the drivers to unionize. The lawsuit going to trial was filed in 2020 by Campbell\u2019s predecessor, Maura Healey, now the state\u2019s Democratic governor. Should the state prevail, it has said the companies could face large penalties for not properly classifying their drivers. By not classifying their Massachusetts drivers as employees,\u00a0Uber\u00a0and Lyft avoided paying $266.4 million into workers\u2019 compensation, unemployment insurance and paid family medical leave over 10 years, according to a report by the state auditor.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/tech/uber-lyft-massachusetts-trial/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_media_nbc-news-ousts-ronna-mcdaniel", "text": "NBC News on Tuesday ousted former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel, just days after her hiring as a paid political analyst sparked intense backlash from the network\u2019s top television anchors over McDaniel\u2019s role in subverting the 2020 election and attacks on the press. \u201cThere is no doubt that the last several days have been difficult for the News Group,\u201d NBCUniversal News Group President Cesar Conde said in a memo to staff. \u201cAfter listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor.\u201d \u201cI want to personally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down,\u201d Conde continued. \u201cWhile this was a collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team, I approved it and take full responsibility for it.\u201d Ahead of the network\u2019s decision, McDaniel spent the day Tuesday interviewing attorneys in preparation for a potential legal battle with NBC, a person familiar with the matter told CNN. Creative Artists Agency, the talent agency that brokered McDaniel\u2019s deal with NBC, also parted ways with her, the person said. The reversal comes after journalists and anchors at both NBC and its cable news sibling MSNBC publicly denounced the decision to hire McDaniel as a paid analyst in a stunning and unprecedented on-air rebuke of network brass that has embarrassed the Peacock Network. McDaniel, who recently stepped down from the RNC under pressure from former President Donald Trump, was involved in attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. As head of the RNC, she was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d In the years since, McDaniel continued to claim that the election had \u201cproblems\u201d and that Biden did not legitimately win the election, fanning the flames of election denialism. NBC\u2019s announcement Friday that it had hired McDaniel was quickly met with alarm by the network\u2019s journalists. The revolt spilled into public view on Sunday when McDaniel appeared on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with moderator Kristen Welker in her first interview since she was hired by the network. Welker disclosed that the interview had been scheduled to take place prior to NBC announcing McDaniel would become a paid contributor for the network, stating that she had no involvement in her hiring. Following the interview, Chuck Todd, NBC News\u2019 chief political analyst, delivered a stinging on-air criticism of NBC executives for their decision to hire McDaniel, telling Welker, \u201cI think our bosses owe you an apology for putting you in this situation.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a reason a lot of journalists at NBC News are uncomfortable with this,\u201d Todd said, explaining that under McDaniel, the RNC engaged in \u201cgaslighting\u201d and \u201ccharacter assassination\u201d when dealing with the news media. The following day, MSNBC hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough joined Todd in protesting the decision on their program \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d \u201cTo be clear, we believe NBC News should seek out conservative Republican voices to provide balance in their election coverage, but it should be conservative Republicans, not a person who used her position of power to be an anti-democracy election denier,\u201d\u00a0Brzezinski said. \u201cWe hope NBC will reconsider its decision. It goes without saying that she will not be a guest on \u2018Morning Joe\u2019 in her capacity as a paid contributor.\u201d Nicolle Wallace, host of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cDeadline: White House,\u201d later joined in the rebuke, saying on her program that the network\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel was nothing short of a potential threat to democracy. \u201cNBC News is, either wittingly or unwittingly, teaching election deniers that what they can do stretches well beyond appearing on our air and interviews to peddle lies about the sanctity and integrity of our elections,\u201d Wallace told viewers. Rachel Maddow \u2014 the network\u2019s biggest star \u2014 later devoted the first half-hour of her prime-time program to the controversy, saying the decision to hire McDaniel was \u201cinexplicable.\u201d Maddow took issue with McDaniel\u2019s long track record of demonizing the news media, labeling the press as \u201cfake news,\u201d and launching ugly attacks on NBC News journalists and MSNBC hosts. \u201cWe do not take it personally when we get attacked, when they say they want to put us on trial and execute us for treason,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so I want to associate myself with all my colleagues at MSNBC and NBC News who have voiced loud and principled objections to our company for putting on the payroll someone who hasn\u2019t just attacked us as journalists, but someone who is part of an ongoing project to get rid of our system of government,\u201d she said of McDaniel. \u201cSomeone who is still trying to convince Americans that this election stuff doesn\u2019t really work. That this last election wasn\u2019t a real result.

{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit", "text": "When Apple launched its first Mac computer in 1984, with its iconic Mac smiley-face \u201chello\u201d greeting, it wanted to differentiate itself in the fledgling PC market. The Mac was approachable with its friendly, innovative design \u2013 Apple\u2019s way of setting the Mac apart in the confusing PC landscape. That consumer-friendly mantra still exists today, with Apple carefully curating an easy-breezy yet controlled user experience across its products, including the billions of iPhones used around the world. But the Biden administration believes Apple took that too far. On Thursday, the Department of Justice sued Apple for illegally monopolizing the smartphone market. In a press conference, the government provided a long list of how Apple has allegedly squashed competition with restrictive app store terms, high fees and its \u201cwalled-garden\u201d approach, restricting how third-party companies interact with its brands and services. The company denied the lawsuit\u2019s allegations and said it plans to fight them. Apple added that the lawsuit could empower the government \u201cto take a heavy hand in designing people\u2019s technology.\u201d But if successful, the lawsuit could ripple across Apple\u2019s products and services. Although the suit could take years to play out, here\u2019s a closer look what it may eventually mean for iPhone users: Changes to the App Store If found liable, the company could be forced to change a number of things. One such change is how iPhone users could get greater access to \u201csuper apps\u201d that have been largely restricted before. The term refers to one-stop-shop apps that allow for messaging, ordering food, payment processing and other capabilities all within one platform.  According to Dipanjan Chatterjee, a principal analyst at market research firm Forrester, super apps most threaten Apple\u2019s preeminence in the lives of its customers. \u201cAn offering like WeChat, dubbed China\u2019s everything app, can provide an alternative to the Apple ecosystem for people to communicate, bank, share memories, talk to businesses and more,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cWhat Apple fears most is becoming irrelevant to its customers.\u201d At the same time, super apps like WeChat are created by larger companies and could, therefore, put some smaller companies at a disadvantage. And the concept hasn\u2019t been welcomed much in the US anyway. The US government, however, could argue that lack of interest may be due to Apple\u2019s high share of the smartphone market and its resistance to offer super apps in its store, Chatterjee said. Better interoperability Apple may also be required to offer more support for cross-platform messaging, an issue the company previously said it\u2019s already working on. The company lets iPhone users send high-quality photos and videos to one another, but similar texts to Android phones are slower and grainy. It also maintains those messages in green bubbles, creating a kind of class divide, critics argue. In November, the company said it will add new features, such as read receipts, typing indicators, better support for group chats and higher quality media sharing of images and videos, across platforms to help close the gap. Apple\u2019s move to add support for the standard called RCS (rich communication services) is intended to roll out later this year. RCS is considered the replacement to alternatives such as SMS, or short messaging service, and can work over both Wi-Fi and mobile data. The change followed pressure from both regulators and competitors to more seamlessly work across operating systems. The European Union\u2019s Digital Markets Act, for example, requires companies to make their key services interoperable between platforms. The US government could require the same. More open services Another likely change is how hardware from other companies, such as smartwatches, will interact with the Apple range of devices and software, including the iPhone and Apple\u2019s services like Fitness+. The company has also required Apple Watch users to own iOS devices as a way to keep them locked into its existing ecosystem. Chatterjee said making this change would have both positives and negatives. \u201cThe net result would reside somewhere along the spectrum of access to more and cheaper options but also the devaluation of the customer experience that is so highly prized by Apple\u2019s customers,\u201d he said. The Biden administration has also taken issue with Apple\u2019s lack of support for mobile cloud services. Loosening this could allow users to access games and other cloud-based apps without having to pay for pricey hardware. Inside the debate The DOJ lawsuit claims Apple\u2019s behavior has illegally hindered competition, kept its customers locked into its products and prevented other companies from innovating. Although the Biden administration will have to prove these harms, some critics say any potential changes Apple could make will negatively impact the user experience. David McQueen, a research director at ABI Research, said he recognizes that the content and applications market should be open, and Apple needs to avoid monopolistic advantages that can restrict competition, push up prices or block innovation. But Apple\u2019s success stems in part to its tight grip on its products and services, keeping things intuitive and seamless. \u201cIf Apple is forced to comply, it could potentially spell the end to the provision of this consistent and unified user experience, although by the same token, consumers will be open to a greater choice of apps and services, helping more developers and providers,\u201d McQueen said. Chatterjee noted some people are drawn to the Apple family of products precisely because of the carefully managed ecosystem\u2019s ease of use. Apple may have to work that much harder to preserve the integrity of its experience, but any changes probably won\u2019t be enough to make customers to leave and go elsewhere. \u201cThe vast majority of Apple customers would probably be happier with some more choice and lower prices as long as it did not hamper their levels of customer experience, which is threatened by the less control Apple has over the experience,\u201d Chatterjee said. But he added those currently outside of the Apple ecosystem will likely benefit by \u201cplugging in opportunistically without having to go all in with Apple.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "business"}}

The company had stopped testing last October following an incident in San Francisco in which a pedestrian was badly injured. Cruise\u2019s vehicles will begin driving again in Phoenix, Arizona, but with a \u201csafety driver\u201d at the wheel of the modified Chevrolet Bolt EVs. The vehicles will still mostly drive themselves but a person will be in the driver\u2019s seat ready to take control if needed, such as in an emergency. Last October, a Cruise self-driving car, with no one inside, hit a pedestrian after the person had first been struck by another vehicle. After striking the pedestrian, the Cruise vehicle attempted to pull off to the side of the road to avoid causing an obstruction. This resulted in the person being dragged across the pavement for about 20 feet, further injuring them. A few weeks later, the\u00a0California Department of Motor Vehicles suspended Cruise\u2019s permits\u00a0to operate its vehicles in that state, citing a lack of cooperation in the investigation of the crash. About two days later, Cruise announced it was\u00a0halting all operations nationwide\u00a0while it investigated the incident and the company\u2019s response to it. In the meantime, Cruise said it updated its software to better respond to such incidents in the future.

For her performances, Dex is displayed on a video screen or as a holographic projection, with her mixes created by humans. She is animated using Unreal Engine \u2014 a 3D modeling software widely used in video games \u2014 combined with motion-capture. Generative artificial intelligence allows her to remember information and respond to questions, using a voice also generated by AI. \u201cShe\u2019s probably one of the only digital humans in the performance space that you can have a conversation and interact with,\u201d says Denise Harris, CCO of startup Sum Vivas. \u201cYou can ask her anything.

In March 2023, Google launched Bard (recently renamed Gemini) and around the same time Anthropic released its AI assistant Claude. As generative AI chatbots become increasingly ubiquitous, Sum Vivas is one of several companies looking to make them more human.

{"id": "2024_05_08_business_norfolk-southern-proxy-fight-railroad-safety", "text": "Just more than a year after a massive derailment of a Norfolk Southern freight train led to the release of tank cars full of toxic chemicals and increased attention to the issue of railroad safety, the control of the railroad is up for grabs at its annual meeting Thursday. The fight for control of the Atlanta-based railroad, one of America\u2019s four major freight railroads, could determine more than just who runs the railroad in the future, but also whether it continues using longer and longer trains, a practice criticized by some rail safety advocates. A defeat of current Norfolk Southern management, credited with improving safety practices at the railroad since the February 3, 2023 derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, could make management at other railroads reluctant to take steps to improve safety if it means reduced profit margins. The fight has split the railroad\u2019s unions, who disagree which management team \u2013 the current Norfolk Southern leadership or one proposed by activist investor Ancora Holdings \u2013 would be best for safety and the railroad\u2019s employees. Ancora, which seeks to have its own slate of directors elected and a new CEO and COO put in charge of the railroad, insist current management has proven incapable of running a safe and profitable railroad. It wants to improve profitability at the railroad by greater emphasis on the operating philosphy known as Precision Scheduled Railroading, or PSR, which leads to longer trains making fewer stops at customers\u2019 locations to pick-up or drop-off rail cars. PSR is generally opposed by both rail unions and many rail customers, and Norfolk management appeared to be taking steps away from PSR in the wake of the East Palestine derailment. Norfolk Southern CEO Alan Shaw and his management team received praised by some who, in the past, criticized the railroad\u2019s performance, including Amit Bose, administrator of the Federal Railroad Administration, the nation\u2019s rail regulator. In a letter to Norfolk Southern in February soon after the takeover effort started, Bose praise the railroad instituting a \u201cconfidential close call reporting system\u201d similar to one  in place for decades at the nation\u2019s railroads to allow employees to report safety issues without fear of reprisal, as well as increasing staffing and training. He said Shaw\u2019s safety efforts \u201care important and demonstrate the ability to make progress when railroads make safety a priority.\u201d And he said that NS was the only Class I railroad to achieve significant reductions in the rate of mainline derailments last year. His letter suggested his concerns that that progress could be lost due to the takeover battle. \u201cWhile I recognize NS for the meaningful steps and results seen so far, often in notable contrast to industry peers, I want to emphasize the importance of a durable and lasting path forward that continues to prioritize safety,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAny backsliding, as a result of a change in leadership or otherwise, on the safety-oriented path you have laid out and communicated to us will likely attract renewed oversight attention from my office.\u201d Unions split on which side should win After initially being united in opposition to the takeover effort, the railroad\u2019s unions are now split on the takeover battle. Most of the unions remain supportive of current CEO Alan Shaw and Norfolk Southern\u2019s current board. \u201cNS and Shaw have placed a unique focus on establishing a culture that addresses safety concerns that other carriers have not,\u201d said a letter from Jeremy Ferguson, president of SMART-TD, the union that represents more than 5,000 conductors at the railroad. The Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET), which represents more than 3,000 engineers at the railroad, joined the other unions at the railroad in initially endorsing Norfolk management, saying that Ancora\u2019s plans for Norfolk would be\u00a0\u201creckless\u201d and \u201clikely to lead to more train wrecks.\u201d It said Ancora\u2019s PSR plan \u201crequires railroads to do more with less which equates to longer trains, deferred maintenance of track and equipment, shorter inspections of rolling stock and a reduction in staffing numbers.\u201d And it praised the changes that Shaw had made to improve safety since the February 2023 derailment in East Palestine, Ohio. \u201cShaw was only on the job for a few months prior to the disaster.\u00a0Since the derailment last year, NS\u2019 CEO has risen to the occasion and, through his leadership, NS has become a safer, more efficient and customer focused company again,\u201d said\u00a0Jerry Sturdivant, a BLET union official at Norfolk Southern, back in February. Reversing course But the BLET said the changes that Norfolk Southern has made to try to answer Ancora\u2019s takeover efforts are taking the railroad in the wrong direction. It is particularly upset with the work of the railroad\u2019s new chief operating officer, John Orr, hired in March from Canadian Pacific Kansas City, for a pay package with a target value of $10.3 million. BLET said that Orr\u2019s appointment shows that Norfolk Southern is committed to additional use of PSR, no matter which side wins the the proxy fight. And it said it has received assurances of other safety improvements from Ancora, including dropping all plans to have single-person crews on long-distance trains. The current labor contract requires both an engineer and a conductor in the locomotive, and a recent proposed federal rule would codify the requirement. Although that rule has yet to take effect and could be reversed in the future. And the nation\u2019s major railroads would still prefer to remove the conductors from the trains, arguing it can be done without reducing safety. \u201cAlthough we initially supported Mr. Shaw and Norfolk Southern\u2019s management in this contest, today he leads a different team with\u00a0an unproven strategy,\u201d said a statement from three BLET officials at the railroad. \u201cThe ever-changing and inconsistent policies that we have been hearing from the railroad\u2019s current leadership in recent weeks forced BLET to take another look at Ancora and its nominees. We ultimately made a final decision to support the Ancora slate and CEO choice.\u201d The Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees Division (BMWED) whose members perform track maintenance, joined the BLET in switching support to Ancora. \u201cFor many months since East Palestine, the BMWED has not been able to get assurances from the current leadership to implement needed policy and procedural changes to prevent such tragedies from reoccurring,\u201d it said. \u201cAt this juncture, seeing no path forward, we see no reason to support the current administration at Norfolk Southern.\u201d Ancora has tapped former UPS executive Jim Barber to be the next CEO if it wins. Both BLET and BMWE are part of the Teamsters union, which has more than 300,000 members working for UPS. Shaw and Norfolk Southern\u2019s management still has the support of the other unions at the railroad, which between them represent about 60% of the unionized employees there. SMART-TD issued a statement calling the BLET \u201cJudas,\u201d saying union leadership \u201cshould be ashamed.\u201d \u201cThey were willing to hand over everything our movement has done to defend our men and women against PSR at NS,\u201d said SMART-TD. Shaw and current Norfolk Southern management \u201chave made a conscious effort to diverge from the operating ratio-obsessed mentality that has degraded rail service and safety\u2026 and have made safety, employees and customers their priority,\u201d it said in a separate statement. Up to investors But no matter what the unions and safety regulator thinks about the choices, the decision will ride with shareholders who are likely displeased by the performance of the company\u2019s stock, and the financial results. Shares of Norfolk Southern are down 8% from where they were before the February 3 2023 derailment, compared to a 5% gain in CSX shares and 13% rise in shares of Union Pacific. Norfolk\u2019s profit margin is also lower than industry averages and it shrank in the first quarter compared to a year earlier, even when stripping out the cost of the derailment. The Ancora takeover effort has gotten endorsement from two leading shareholder services firms, Glass Lewis and ISS. \u201cHaving given due consideration to the arguments presented by each side, we believe Ancora has presented a compelling case for supporting a substantial overhaul of the Company\u2019s current leadership,\u201d said a statement from Glass Lewis.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/08/business/norfolk-southern-proxy-fight-railroad-safety/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_13_investing_gamestop-roaring-kitty", "text": "The surprise social media return of the trader who helped ignite the meme stock frenzy in 2021 sent GameStop shares skyrocketing Monday. The surge had nothing to do with the troubled company\u2019s fundamentals \u2014 and everything to do with a cartoon of a gamer that the trader, nicknamed Roaring Kitty, shared on X. GameStop shares surged 74% on Monday after the account run by Keith Gill shared a meme on X, marking its first post in three years. The shares skyrocketed by more than 110% earlier and were halted for volatility several times on Monday morning. Short sellers have seen $1 billion in mark-to-market losses betting against GameStop on Monday, according to data company S3 Partners. Short-sellers aim to turn profits on a stock by borrowing shares, selling them and returning them after purchasing them at a lower price. Shares of AMC Entertainment, another meme stock, popped 78%. Reddit shares climbed roughly 9%. Shares of trading platform Robinhood Markets, which suspended purchases\u00a0of\u00a0GameStop,\u00a0AMC and other meme stocks during the frenzy in 2021, rose 4%. The image Gill posted depicts a man leaning forward in a chair with a video game console in hand. GameStop had posted the same cartoon in February, but with a blue arrow and chair. In Gill\u2019s cartoon, they are red. The meme is interpreted to convey, \u201cwhen things get serious,\u201d according to Know Your Meme. Gill did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment. GameStop shares tripped multiple circuit breakers \u2014 a temporary and mandated halt in trading to let investors cool off for a bit. Robinhood denied claims on social media on Monday that it had once again halted GameStop stock purchases on its platform. \u201cThis is incorrect. Robinhood has not shut down the purchase of Gamestop shares,\u201d Robinhood spokesperson Anupriya Ghate said in a statement to CNN. \u201cGME is seeing elevated volatility and movement, which triggers market-wide exchange trading limits and halts. These are market-wide and not specific to Robinhood.\u201d Who is Roaring Kitty? Gill, who goes by \u201cDeepf\u2014-ingvalue\u201d on Reddit, was one of the leading forces on the WallStreetBets subreddit that drove eye-popping returns in GameStop\u2019s stock. The traders bid up shares of the retailer, targeting short sellers. The retail investors sent other stocks soaring in 2021, including AMC Entertainment and Bed Bath & Beyond. They are now collectively known as meme stocks, or shares of companies with a cult following that see wide swings based on their popularity among trader communities on social media rather than their fundamentals. Gill described himself as a casual daytime trader in testimony during a 2021 Congressional hearing on the GameStop mania. He has said he did not set out to help stoke the GameStop frenzy and instead believed that the stock was an attractive opportunity for investors. \u201cThe idea that I used social media to promote GameStop stock to unwitting investors is preposterous,\u201d Gill said in written testimony.\u00a0\u201cI was abundantly clear that my channel was for educational purposes only. \u2026 Whether other individual investors bought the stock was irrelevant to my thesis.\u201d Gill also said that he first purchased GameStop stock, and later call options, in the summer of 2019, when the stock was trading around $5 apiece. He added to his position through the rest of the year and 2020, and testified that he believed \u201cthe market remains oblivious to GameStop\u2019s unique opportunity.\u201d But even he didn\u2019t believe it would hit a high of $483 a share in 2021. \u201cAt the time I thought it was possible but a very low probability,\u201d Gill testified. Gill was a main character in the 2023 movie \u201cDumb Money\u201d (played by actor Paul Dano), which portrays the events leading up to and during the GameStop short squeeze. As stocks settle after the trading day, levels might change slightly.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/investing/gamestop-roaring-kitty/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_13_tech_openai-altman-new-ai-model-gpt-4o", "text": "ChatGPT is about to become a lot more useful. OpenAI on Monday announced its latest artificial intelligence large language model that it says will make ChatGPT smarter and easier to use. The new model, called GPT-4o, is an update from the company\u2019s previous GPT-4 model, which launched just over a year ago. The model will be available to unpaid customers, meaning anyone will have access to OpenAI\u2019s most advanced technology through ChatGPT. Based on the company\u2019s Monday demonstration, GPT-4o will effectively turn ChatGPT into a digital personal assistant that can engage in real-time, spoken conversations. It will also be able to interact using text and \u201cvision,\u201d meaning it can view screenshots, photos, documents or charts uploaded by users and have a conversation about them. OpenAI Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati said the updated version of ChatGPT will now also have memory capabilities, meaning it can learn from previous conversations with users, and can do real-time translation. \u201cThis is the first time that we are really making a huge step forward when it comes to the ease of use,\u201d Murati said during the live demo from the company\u2019s San Francisco headquarters. \u201cThis interaction becomes much more natural and far, far easier.\u201d The new release comes as OpenAI seeks to stay ahead of the growing competition in the AI arms race. Rivals including Google and Meta have been working to build increasingly powerful large language models that power chatbots and can be used to bring AI technology to various other products. The OpenAI event came one day ahead of Google\u2019s annual I/O developer conference, at which it\u2019s expected to announce updates to its Gemini AI model. Like the new GPT-4o, Google\u2019s Gemini is also multimodal, meaning it can interpret and generate text, images and audio. OpenAI\u2019s update also comes ahead of expected AI announcements from Apple at its Worldwide Developers Conference next month, which could include new ways of incorporating AI into the next iPhone or iOS releases. Meanwhile, the latest GPT release could be a boon to Microsoft, which has invested billions of dollars into OpenAI to embed its AI technology into Microsoft\u2019s own products. OpenAI executives demonstrated a spoken conversation with ChatGPT to get real-time instructions for solving a math problem, to tell a bedtime story and to get coding advice. ChatGPT was able to speak in a natural, human-sounding voice, as well as a robot voice \u2014 and even sang part of one response. The tool was also able to look at an image of a chart and discuss it. They also showed the model detecting users\u2019 emotions; in one instance, it listened to an executive\u2019s breathing and encouraged him to calm down. \u201cYou\u2019re not a vacuum cleaner!\u201d the female voice of ChatGPT (which sounds remarkably similar to the Scarlett Johansson-voiced digital companion from the 2013 film \u201cHer\u201d) jokingly told the staff member. ChatGPT was also able to have a conversation in multiple languages by translating and responding automatically. The tool now supports more than 50 languages, according to OpenAI. \u201cThe new voice (and video) mode is the best computer interface I\u2019ve ever used,\u201d OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a blog post following the announcement. \u201cIt feels like AI from the movies; and it\u2019s still a bit surprising to me that it\u2019s real. Getting to human-level response times and expressiveness turns out to be a big change.\u201d Murati said that OpenAI will launch a ChatGPT desktop app with the GPT-4o capabilities, giving users another platform to interact with the company\u2019s technology. GPT-4o will also be available to developers looking to build their own custom chatbots from OpenAI\u2019s GPT store, a feature that will now also be available to non-paying users. The updated technology and features are set to roll out to ChatGPT in the coming months. Free ChatGPT users will have a limited number of interactions with the new GPT-4o model before the tool automatically reverts to relying on the old GPT-3.5 model; paid users will have access to a greater number of messages with the latest model. OpenAI said more than 100 million people already are using ChatGPT.

{"id": "2022_04_25_business_electric-hybrid-corvette", "text": "General Motors will produce a fully electric Chevrolet Corvette, GM President Mark Reuss announced in a LinkedIn post Monday morning.  Reuss didn\u2019t say when the electric Corvette would come, but he hinted that a hybrid model could come relatively soon. \u201cWe will offer an electrified Corvette as early as next year,\u201d he wrote. An accompanying video the company posted to Twitter showed what appeared to be a hybrid Corvette, and in another first, showed the front wheels spinning and throwing snow as if being powered. All Corvettes produced by the company previously have been rear-wheel-drive only. While Reuss\u2019s post implies a hybrid Corvette will be based on the current generation of the car, it\u2019s not clear if the all-electric version will be a variation of this car or a completely different future model. \u201cElectrified\u201d is an auto industry term encompassing everything from hybrid to fully electric vehicles, and anything with an electric motor can count as \u201celectrified.\u201d It has long been rumored that the current generation of the Corvette, the first with its gasoline engine mounted behind the seats instead of in the front, could be built with a hybrid system. Reuss has also previously hinted there would be electrified variants of the car. Various companies are working on electric sports cars. Most all-electric vehicles in production so far have been four-door sedans and SUVs, as the need for batteries lends itself to larger and heavier vehicles. Tesla\u2019s first car, the Lotus Elise-based Tesla Roadster, was an electric sports car, but the second-generation of Tesla Roadster, originally unveiled as a prototype in 2017, has yet to go into production. Some manufacturers, such as Lamborghini, have said that current battery technology doesn\u2019t allow for a optimum sports car performance from a purely electric vehicle. Lamborghini has been working on plug-in hybrid sports cars, though. To date, the Corvette is only available in the base Stingray version with 6.2-liter V8 engine producing up to 495 horsepower. A 670 horsepower Corvette Z06 with a 5.5-liter V8 was unveiled last fall. The previous generation of the Corvette included included a 755-horsepower ZR1 version. Nothing like that has yet been announced for the current model but GM engineers have said a major reason for putting the engine in the back was to allow for better performance at extremely high horsepower levels. Besides saving gas, hybrid systems can also be used in high-performance cars to add additional power and to provide for quicker acceleration since electric motors can provide power to the wheels more quickly than gas engines. Ferrari\u2019s most powerful sports cars are hybrids, for instance.   GM has said it plans to produce only zero-emission vehicles, meaning fully electric or powered by hydrogen fuel cells, by 2035.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/25/business/electric-hybrid-corvette/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_11_business_airplane-food-travel", "text": "If you took an American Airlines flight in the 1960s, you\u2019d be wined and dined from the Coach-class  \u201cRoyal Coachman\u201d menu. Your meal began with the beef consomm\u00e9 and proceeded to saut\u00e9ed breast of chicken in wine. Care for a fruit tartlet for dessert? Today, if you\u2019re flying coach, you\u2019ll need to book a long-distance international flight or \u2013 maybe\u00a0if you\u2019re lucky \u2013 a coast-to-coast domestic one to receive a free meal. On shorter flights, you might get a choice of complementary Biscoff cookies or pretzels. Airplane food has fallen\u00a0a long way from the glory days of in-flight dining when meals were served on white tablecloths and stewardesses scrambled eggs in the air. Disappearing meals have joined a long list of pain points, inconveniences and cutbacks that fliers endure today.\u00a0But industry cost-cutting isn\u2019t the only reason your tartlet is gone. The end of in-flight dining for many passengers surprisingly rose out of big changes in government regulation, airplane design, in-flight movies, industry tax breaks, plus heightened health and safety concerns. Airline safety protocols and regulations since September 11 have changed what types of cooking knives crews can work with in the air.\u00a0Airplane galleys are smaller to allow for more passenger seats on a plane. And airlines don\u2019t serve some foods, like peanuts, to protect people with allergies. Meals are often smaller, blander or non-existent. \u201cMeal service was once a point of pride,\u201d said Henry Harteveldt, who covers the travel industry for Atmosphere Research Group. Now, \u201cthe quality is so poor you have to wonder: Do airline executives actually have taste buds?\u201d Airlines have long looked for ways to cut food production costs and reduce meal preparation times for flight attendants on board. In one famous example during the 1980s, Robert Crandall, then the head of American Airlines, bragged about how removing just one olive from every salad saved the airline $40,000 a year. Cost and speed became more important to airlines than how the food tastes ever since. Carriers like Singapore Airlines or Delta may have partnerships with Michelin-starred celebrity chefs, but most companies farm out their food to catering services who may prepare it hours ahead. \u201cPeople are willing to trade food for low fares,\u201d said Blaise Waguespack, a professor of airline marketing at Embry\u2011Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, Florida.\u00a0\u201cYour ticket gets you the seat. And anything beyond the seat you pay for.\u201d Charging passengers for food on board \u2013 even just a few dollars for a sandwich, snack box or cheese plate - is also a way for airlines to save on taxes. Domestic airfares are subject to a 7.5% federal excise tax, but that tax doesn\u2019t apply to baggage fees and on-board food, both of which are getting more expensive. Caviar and free chewing gum Food on planes has been around almost a century, ever since 1920s flight attendants handed out chewing gum to passengers to relieve pressure in their ears. Early airplanes bounced so much in flight that meals were served on paper plates, according to the Smithsonian. For decades, the federal government regulated airfare and routes, so airlines tried to set themselves apart with service, food and the kind of luxury usually afforded cruise passengers \u2013 or a Bond villain. Until 1978, when the airline industry was deregulated, the law required that every passenger got an entr\u00e9e, two vegetables, a salad, dessert and a drink as part of their ticket price, according to the Smithsonian. \u201cDelicious food adds to the enjoyment. It\u2019s prepared in four simultaneously operating galleys, where dishes can be cooked in five-minute ovens,\u201d Pan Am advertised in a 1958 commercial. During the 1960s and 1970s, airlines routinely installed sky-high kitchens on board and advertised their menus to draw customers. Beef was a business strategy. \u201dAirlines competed on service and amenities. Meal service was a big focus of [competition] because entertainment options were more limited,\u201d Harteveldt said. \u201cAirlines would have teams of chefs, their own catering kitchens [and] advertising around food.\u201d As deregulation took hold, airlines cut ticket prices. But to make up for lost revenue, they cut back on food choices and other services as well. The September 11 attacks accelerated the decline of free airline meals. Airlines faced a deep reduction in demand and slashed in-flight meal service in response. United, American Airlines, Delta and others announced sharp reductions in-flight meal service shortly after the attacks. The last holdout, Continental Airlines, became the final major airline to end free domestic meals in economy class in 2010. Airline meals had been the brunt of jokes and criticism for decades, but now people miss them. Few airline-industry experts see them coming back anytime soon in coach. The reality is very different for business and first-class passengers. Molly Brandt, the executive chef of culinary innovation for North America at in-flight catering company Gategroup, said that the \u201cgolden age for airline food is here.\u201d It just depends on which airline you\u2019re flying and category you\u2019re in. \u201cIt\u2019s broken down by cabin class,\u201d she explained. If you\u2019re in first class on\u00a0an American flight, for example, you may have a lunch choice of a Mediterranean bowl, chicken breast with mojo sauce, Poblano black bean rice and plantains or penne pasta with\u00a0plant-based ragu and ricotta. For Delta, pick between the cheeseburger, the spinach and cheese agnolotti, or a Hempler\u2019s smoked peppered chicken breast salad. A handful of airlines even offer caviar to first class passengers. But most fliers these days don\u2019t even get the free chewing gum.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/11/business/airplane-food-travel/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_19_success_wall-street-bonuses", "text": "Last year wasn\u2019t the most lucrative for Wall Street bankers, but their bonus payouts still easily trounced US median household income. The average Wall Street bonus for 2023 was $176,500, according to estimates that will be released Tuesday morning by New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli. That\u2019s down 2% from the $180,000 recorded in 2022. Both those averages were well below the $240,000 paid out in 2021. That the average bonus was slightly down isn\u2019t surprising. Wall Street earnings last year were mixed, and merger and acquisition activity was underwhelming. \u201cWall Street\u2019s profits were up 1.8% in 2023, but firms have taken a more cautious approach to compensation and more employees have joined the securities industry, which accounts for the slight decline in the average bonus,\u201d DiNapoli said in a statement. Nevertheless, a little perspective: The average Wall Street bonus, which comes on top of the nearly half-a-million-dollar average Wall Street salary, was itself almost 2.5 times higher than the median US household income of $74,580, according to Census data for 2022. Wall Street bonuses and general employment in the securities industry provide vital revenue streams for the New York State and New York City economies, accounting most recently for 27% of the state\u2019s tax collections and 7% of city tax revenue, according to DiNapoli\u2019s office. The securities industry \ufeffin the city employed roughly 198,500 people last year, up from 191,600 the year before. And DiNapoli estimates that 1 in 11 of the city\u2019s jobs are either directly or indirectly associated with the industry. The total estimated bonus pool for 2023 was\u00a0slightly lower than the year before and is\u00a0projected to bring in $4 million less in state income tax revenue and $2 million less for the city revenue than bonuses in 2022 did. Still, DiNapoli noted, \u201cWhile these bonuses affect income tax revenues for the state and city, both budgeted for larger declines so the impact on projected revenues should be limited.\u201d It should be noted that the comptroller\u2019s numbers only reflect the bonuses paid to securities industry employees working for firms based in New York City. Beyond bringing in tax revenue for government coffers, Wall Street workers contribute substantially to the local Gotham economy. DiNapoli said that more employees in financial services (65%) are working in-office on any given day compared to 58% working in other industries in the city, at least as of September 2023. And that securities industry employees use the subway more than other workers in the city. All in, he estimates that Wall Street is responsible for roughly 14% of economic activity in the city. As critical as that is, the city and state are about much more than just Wall Street. \u201cThe securities industry\u2019s continued strength should not overshadow the broader economic picture in New York, where we need all sectors to enjoy full recovery from the pandemic,\u201d DiNapoli said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/19/success/wall-street-bonuses/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_judges-stern-rebuke-of-elon-musks-x-gives-researchers-fresh-hope", "text": "A federal judge\u2019s decision this week reprimanding Elon Musk\u2019s X will have reverberating effects on efforts to hold influential online platforms accountable, legal experts and advocacy groups say. On Monday, District Judge Charles Breyer dismissed and excoriated a lawsuit by X against online watchdog group Center for Countering Digital Hate as an attempt to silence the non-profit group for sounding alarms about hate speech on the platform. Breyer wrote in Monday\u2019s order that the lawsuit was \u201cunabashedly\u201d about \u201cpunishing\u201d reports written by CCDH, which X had accused of campaigning to drive away its advertisers. Breyer held that the reports were \u201cunquestionably\u201d protected by the group\u2019s free speech rights. Now, that decision could embolden other research groups and Musk critics who have faced legal threats from the billionaire. The CCDH case \u2014 in the US District Court for the Northern District of California \u2014\u00a0has been widely viewed as a bellwether for research and accountability on X, where Musk has restored the accounts of previously banned White supremacists and spreaders of misinformation and where Musk himself has amplified various conspiracy theories. And CCDH is not the only organization that has faced attacks by self-proclaimed \u201cfree speech absolutist\u201d Musk after criticizing or raising concerns about his platform. \u201cThis is an important decision that sees Elon Musk\u2019s lawsuit for what it is \u2014 an effort to punish his critics for constitutionally protected speech and to deter researchers from studying his platform,\u201d said Alex Abdo, litigation director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, which had filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the case arguing that private companies should not be allowed to use breach of contract claims to punish criticism. \u201cSociety needs reliable and ethical research into social media platforms, and often that research relies on being able to study publicly available posts,\u201d Abdo said. X said it plans to appeal Breyer\u2019s decision. Musk\u2019s threats against X critics In his first year as owner of X, formerly known as Twitter, Musk threatened legal action against the Anti-Defamation League for defamation, as well as against Microsoft and Meta for allegedly improper data and trade secret access, respectively. None of those threats ever amounted to real lawsuits. He did, however, sue the progressive media watchdog Media Matters over its\u00a0analysis\u00a0highlighting antisemitic and pro-Nazi content on X, alleging that the group\u2019s testing methodology was not representative of how real users experience the site and that the report was designed to drive away advertisers. Legal experts have described that case as \u201cweak\u201d on the merits and as a \u201cbogus\u201d attempt to chill criticism of X. This week\u2019s court decision may be only a temporary setback in Musk\u2019s wider plan to stifle criticism, said Media Matters CEO Angelo Carusone. Musk\u2019s new playbook, Carusone said, enlists the help of sympathetic Republican attorneys general to investigate independent reporting organizations and tie them up in legal proceedings. The states of Texas and Missouri each announced probes into Media Matters following X\u2019s lawsuit against the group, to which Musk responded, \u201cGreat!\u201d As recently as Monday, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey filed a petition in state court seeking to compel Media Matters\u2019 cooperation with his investigation. The filing came a week after he appeared with Musk in a live event on X \u2014 which Carusone said shows how Musk hopes to deputize the power of government to silence his critics. \u201cThey have every reason to do it,\u201d Carusone said of the AGs\u2019 investigations. \u201cThey get the political benefits, they get the attention. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any cost to them yet. And if they are successful at developing this new playbook, this new terrain, legally, then it\u2019s going to pave the way for them to just use this tool and tactic over and over and over again.\u201d A representative for X did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Carusone\u2019s claims. Researchers face hurdles to studying on-platform behavior Researchers from non-profits and academic institutions have had a harder time studying X since Musk\u2019s takeover in 2022. Academics need large samples of posts, shares, likes and other data to study social media trends in mis- and disinformation, public health, elections and other key topics. But one of Musk\u2019s first changes at X was to put access to platform data behind a steep paywall. Researchers and civil society groups said the new subscription fees \u2014 costing up to $2.5 million a year \u2014\u00a0were \u201coutrageously expensive\u201d and made it impossible to do their work, reducing transparency of a critical platform. The change may have forced some researchers to rely more heavily on first-person observational data to draw conclusions about user behavior on X. Groups like CCDH have also used automated \u201cscraping\u201d of publicly viewable content from X rather than paying the company for data directly, a tactic that helped give rise to X\u2019s initial lawsuit. Efforts by X and other social media companies to limit research transparency makes them less accountable to the public at best and, at worst, could mask malicious behavior, said David Karpf, an associate professor in the School of Media and Public Affairs at George Washington University. \u201cWe need independent research to have any real measure of what\u2019s going on at X/Twitter. Musk is only ever going to release data that makes his company look good,\u201d Karpf said. \u201cThese platforms are too big and too vital to the spread of information to be left unmonitored.\u201d \u201cThis is an election year,\u201d Karpf added, \u201cand the platforms are taking steps to make it harder to monitor how their services are used for malignant ends.\u201d Free Press, another media accountability organization that has been critical of Musk\u2019s leadership of X and which called for advertisers to pause their spending on the platform shortly after his takeover, also celebrated Breyer\u2019s ruling as potentially removing at least one hurdle that watchdog organizations face. \u201cThe guardrails for democracy are hanging by a thread and we have dwindling insights into platform practices as researchers face lawsuits, congressional subpoenas and other scare tactics,\u201d said Nora Benavidez, senior counsel and director of digital rights at Free Press. Ultimately, Benavidez called the ruling \u201ca reminder that platform accountability is essential and will inevitably prevail when up against bullies like Musk who try to silence us.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/judges-stern-rebuke-of-elon-musks-x-gives-researchers-fresh-hope/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_09_food_japan-bread-rat-parts-recall-intl-hnk", "text": "A major Japanese food supplier has recalled more than 100,000 packs of a popular brand of sliced white bread after\u00a0rat parts were found inside some loaves. The latest scare adds to a raft of\u00a0food safety scandals plaguing Asia\u2019s second biggest economy, which has a longstanding reputation for the reliability of its food exports. In a statement on Wednesday, Pasco Shikishima Corporation said it was investigating how parts of \u201ca small animal\u201d found its way into two packets of sliced bread, adding that no one has fallen sick so far after consuming the product. It later confirmed to CNN that the remains belonged to a rat. They were found in a batch of white \u201cchojuku\u201d bread \u2014\u00a0or super fermented bread, known for its extra chewy texture \u2014\u00a0manufactured by a factory based in western Tokyo prefecture, according to the company. \u201cWe will recall the products below that were produced on the same factory line and halt the line in question in the meantime to determine the cause and implement countermeasures,\u201d it said in the statement, adding that the recall involves some 104,000 packs. \u201cWe express our sincere gratitude for your exceptional choice of our products,\u201d it said. The recalled product is not sold overseas, a company spokesperson told CNN. White bread is a staple for many Japanese people when they feel like a Western-style meal, or \u201cyoshoku,\u201d as an alternative to traditional Japanese food. Founded in 1920, Pasco is a major supplier of baked goods that employs more than 3,700 staff\u00a0at 12 factories across the country. The recall is not the only food scare to have hit Japan in recent years. In March, Japanese health authorities ordered the withdrawal of three dietary supplements produced by Kobayashi Pharmaceutical, a major drug maker, following the deaths of several users. More than 100 others were hospitalized. Last August, food supplier Warabeya Nichiyo disclosed two instances of cockroaches being found inside its rice balls that were sold at a 7-Eleven convenience store in Saitama, north of Tokyo, according to Reuters. Some of the fast food chains selling the country\u2019s famous beef rice bowls and sushi were also subject to what was dubbed \u201cfood terrorism\u201d pranks carried out by people licking shared soy sauce bottles or eating communal ginger with used chopsticks. Pasco\u2019s recall has drawn a flurry of comments on social media from patrons torn between their love of the company\u2019s products and shock from the discovery. One affected customer wrote on X: \u201cI was thinking whether I should put it in the freezer for the expiration date when I got the news \u2026 I used to like the chojuku the best.\u201d Some took sarcastic aim at the company by referencing an advertisement for the bread. The 15-second commercial, released months ago, features a family excitingly declaring their love of\u00a0good toast as breakfast, accompanied by a voice-over saying: \u201cWe put nothing unnecessary in it.\u201d \u201c\u2060I love chojuku bread. It is safe and contains no unnecessary ingredients. I also use it for my child\u2019s baby food,\u201d another person wrote on X. \u201cI bet it tastes good for small animals too,\u201d the user said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/09/food/japan-bread-rat-parts-recall-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_09_business_ftx-customers-bankruptcy-sbf-nightcap", "text": "People who had money in FTX at the time of its collapse nearly 18 months ago got very lucky this week, as far as bankruptcy proceedings go. But some of them are still, understandably, pretty ticked off. ICYMI:\u00a0FTX, the crypto exchange that has become a byword for fraud and a black eye on the face of the entire digital asset industry, said that virtually all of the people who had money frozen on the platform will get their money back, plus interest. That is an extraordinary outcome. Creditors are rarely made whole in bankruptcy, and it often takes years to claw back whatever pennies on the dollar they\u2019re owed. And yet, for FTX customers, there\u2019s an unavoidable twinge of resentment over what could have been. See here:\u00a0If you had one bitcoin in an FTX account in mid-November of 2022, it was worth about $17,500. Two months ago, when bitcoin hit its all-time high, it would have fetched $73,700. Today, it\u2019d be worth more than $61,000. In other words, if you\u2019d been able to hold onto that bitcoin, you could have seen its value go up more than 300%. Sorry, Tom Brady The speed and scale of the asset recovery is an especially surprising outcome considering the state of FTX when it landed in the hands of John Ray III, the restructuring expert who shepherded the bankruptcy. Ray, who handled Enron\u2019s liquidation, described FTX as a staggeringly mismanaged company with almost no formalized bookkeeping \u2014 a total mess. Ray\u2019s team now says it expects 98% of FTX creditors to receive approximately 118% of the amount of their claims. The bankruptcy managers tracked down all of FTX\u2019s crypto and other holdings and hired an investment manager to sell them. All of that took time, and while it was happening, crypto markets staged a stunning comeback. The bull run inflated the value of FTX\u2019s significant crypto holdings, leaving the estate with more than enough to pay back customers. For that single bitcoin holder, that means after a year and half without being able to access their $17,500 in bitcoin, they\u2019ll get about $20,650 back. It could be worse! FTX\u2019s shareholders \u2014 people like Tom Brady and private equity firms like Sequoia Capital \u2014 are almost certain to see their equity in the once high-flying crypto startup totally wiped out. Although FTX said it would have as much as $16 billion to disburse, customers and Uncle Sam get paid out first. What about SBF? FTX\u2019s founder and its former CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, got a 25-year prison sentence for stealing customer funds and frittering them away on side projects. Pretty much from the moment his crypto empire collapsed, SBF has been making the case that FTX was actually solvent. The money was always there, just, like, not in the most liquid form, he claimed. If he\u2019d just had more time, he could have gotten everyone their money back\u2026 Of course, that\u2019s a somewhat fantastical claim. Sure, the crypto fever returned, but that\u2019s partly because the industry was able to pin the blame for the meltdown on SBF. Prosecutors and the judge were extremely unmoved by SBF\u2019s claim during sentencing that because customers would likely be made whole that there was effectively no harm, no foul. That argument seemed to really irk Ray, the guy who\u2019s spent the past year and a half sifting through the rubble of FTX and hunting down its globe-spanning assets. In a letter to the court ahead of Bankman-Fried\u2019s sentencing, Ray wrote that the company Bankman-Fried left behind was \u201cneither solvent nor safe.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/09/business/ftx-customers-bankruptcy-sbf-nightcap/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "business"}}

OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, with an explicit mission to harness what may soon be superhuman intelligence \u201cto benefit humanity as a whole.\u201d But that sensibility hasn\u2019t lasted. The company now has a multi-billion-dollar for-profit arm. They have been developing new technologies at lightning speed, and sometimes sending them out to the public\u00a0before some employees believed they were ready. The company has already reportedly invented an AI technology so dangerous they will never release it \u2013 but they also\u00a0won\u2019t tell\u00a0reporters or the public exactly what it is. This dynamic \u2013 a potentially dangerous technology developed at extreme speed, largely behind closed doors \u2013 is partly to blame for Altman\u2019s firing. The OpenAI board, according to\u00a0CNN\u2019s David Goldman, worried that \u201cthe company was making the technological equivalent of a nuclear bomb, and its caretaker, Sam Altman, was moving so fast that he risked a global catastrophe.\u201d At particular issue seemed to be Altman\u2019s efforts to make the tools behind ChatGPT available to anyone who wanted to make their own version of the chatbot. This could be widely disastrous, some board members worried. But then they fired him without warning, and apparently without involving Microsoft, the company\u2019s largest shareholder. Now, Altman is at the new AI group at Microsoft, and one has to wonder if the oversight and caution there will be on par with that at OpenAI, or if he\u2019ll be handed carte blanche to push as fast and hard as he wants. And for all the justified reticence of the OpenAI board, the company has carried out much of its work in secrecy \u2013 without the public really understanding what a handful of unaccountable technologists are building, and how it is nearly guaranteed to indelibly change their lives. AI is broadly understood to have the potential to reshape vast swaths of human existence. At the very least, it seems nearly guaranteed to change how we process information, how we communicate, how we learn and how we work (and if we work). And the ramifications could be much more extreme. AI technologies have already demonstrated the ability\u00a0to lie and to cover their tracks. They have already been able to\u00a0suggest the design\u00a0to make a virus spread more quickly. Many researchers\u00a0acutely understand\u00a0just how quickly these machines could develop the capacity to annihilate us, including Altman: He has a prepper\u2019s paradise prepared in Big Sur, complete with guns and \u201cgas masks from the Israeli Defense Force\u201d in case AI goes off the rails and the robots go to war against humans,\u00a0according to reporting in the New Yorker. But don\u2019t worry, he told an Atlantic reporter: If AI is determined to wipe us out, \u201cno gas mask is helping anyone.\u201d (If you want an excellent and terrifying rundown of AI\u2019s risks \u2013 at least those we understand right now, which are almost certainly a mere sliver of the looming perils \u2013\u00a0the Atlantic profile of Altman and his technology\u00a0is worth a read). AI is very exciting technology. But it is also a potentially very dangerous one, and not in the social media sense of \u201cit may give us bad self-esteem and make us lonelier\u201d but in the sense of \u201cit could break down human societies and kill us all.\u201d Given the life-altering potential of AI \u2013 that even if it doesn\u2019t kill us all, it will almost certainly change human existence in unprecedented ways at unprecedented speed \u2013 we all have a stake in how it\u2019s being developed. And yet the development is being left to a handful of people (who seem to be\u00a0largely\u00a0men) in Silicon Valley, and other tech pockets around the globe. And we all have a stake in whose interests AI will serve \u2013 and right now, its development is being funded with billions of dollars by people expecting to make a huge profit. Do the interests of the public align with the interests of the shareholders to whom profit-driven, potentially tremendously lucrative-for-a-few companies are beholden? Or with the interests of tech entrepreneurs who are primarily excited about being at the forefront of the AI revolution, regardless of the potential human costs? One thing is clear: AI is coming. And how it is built and unleashed on the public matters more than perhaps any technology of the past century. It is, indeed, up there with the atom bomb in its destructive potential \u2013 except likely more difficult to regulate and control. \u201cRegulation\u201d does not begin to scratch the surface of what\u2019s needed to make sure that the AI future is not a catastrophic one, especially since the development of AI is now a massive international arms race, with particularly horrific implications if bad actors develop this technology first. But regulation is, at minimum, a necessary step. So is transparency: In the US, companies have wide leverage to work behind a veil of secrecy, and much of what AI companies do is kept secret to stymy competition. But the public certainly has a right to understand what life-altering technologies are set to be inflicted upon us, and what the creators are doing to protect humanity \u2013 our jobs, our communities, our families, our connections, our educations and our abilities to build a life of purpose, but also our lives and our safety. The Altman story is fascinating because Altman is the most powerful figure in AI technology, which in effect makes him one of the most powerful men in the world. But that should give us pause: Who is he, what power does he hold, what is he doing with it, who does he answer to, and are we comfortable with this much life-altering potential being held by a few unaccountable people?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/21/opinions/sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_15_success_best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund", "text": "The average federal tax refund is more than $3,000, according to the latest data from the IRS. Since the majority of tax filers get a refund, there\u2019s a fair chance you could get hundreds if not thousands of dollars back in overpaid taxes, especially if you\u2019re also owed a refund from your state government. That money may feel like a windfall, and it\u2019s easy to squander it on a lot of little things. But if you\u2019re looking to improve your current financial situation, here are seven ideas to consider. Well, technically six, but you\u2019ll enjoy the seventh the most. 1. Pay off high-rate debt If you are carrying a balance on your credit card and are paying 20% to 30% in interest, make this your first priority to pay down. At such sky-high rates, \u201cthe debt can grow faster than you can pay it off,\u201d said Eric Bronnenkant, a certified financial planner and head of tax at Betterment, a robo-advisory financial services firm that also has a human advice team on hand to help clients. Keyana Russ, a certified financial planner at Four Ponds Financial Planning, concurred that people\u2019s awareness of how much money they\u2019re paying in interest over time doesn\u2019t always register. \u201cWhat I usually see is people paying the minimum, or they\u2019re charging everyday expenses and not paying off the bill at the end of the month. \u2026 They don\u2019t understand how much interest they\u2019re paying,\u201d Russ said. For example, if you\u2019re carrying a $3,000 balance at 27% interest and you only pay a required minimum of $97.50 every month, it will take you 240 months (which is 20 years) just to pay off the $3,000 \u2014 and, in addition, you will have paid $3,044.57 in interest, for a total of $6,044.57, according to Bankrate.com\u2019s calculator. 2. Create or add to an emergency fund You can use your refund to start or bolster an emergency fund. When it comes to costly emergencies, there are many Americans who don\u2019t have at least three months\u2019 worth of living expenses set aside, let alone enough to easily handle an unexpected bill of $1,000. Be sure to stash the money in a high-yield savings account at an FDIC-insured bank, Russ suggested, noting that the best interest rates are typically offered by online banks. If you have high-rate debt and you\u2019re lacking emergency savings, Russ suggested you might use a portion of your refund to attack your debt and the other portion to create an emergency fund. Bronnenkant favors paying off the high-rate debt first, but, if you\u2019re low on emergency savings and need a critical repair to help keep your job \u2014 such as on your car \u2014 he said it might make sense to set aside money for that repair and put the rest toward your credit card or other high-rate debt. 3. Make an extra payment on your mortgage If you\u2019re carrying a mortgage at a high rate (e.g., 7% to 8%), and you\u2019re not saddled with credit card debt, you might consider making an extra payment or two. \u201cIt can make a difference in the long run towards your principal,\u201d Russ said.\u00a0 You can even view it as an additional form of savings, in the sense that you\u2019re saving yourself an extra 7% \ufeffor so in interest on the portion of the principal you\u2019re paying down, Bronnenkant noted. 4. Invest in a Roth IRA If your income qualifies you to contribute to a Roth IRA, you can contribute up to $7,000 this year ($8,000 if you\u2019re at least 50) with after-tax savings. That money will grow untaxed until retirement, at which point your withdrawals will be tax-free and penalty-free after age 59-1/2, assuming the account has been open for at least five years. (And note: You can still make a 2023 Roth contribution until April 15 this year. The contribution limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if you\u2019re age 50 or older. Bolstering your tax-free retirement savings is great.\u00a0But if you need to access some of your money well before you retire, you may take out any part of your contributions tax-free and penalty-free at any time, \ufeffBronnenkant said. You would only be taxed and penalized if you withdrew the earnings on your contributions before age 59-1/2. (For more information on Roth IRA withdrawal rules, here is an easy-to-understand rundown from Charles Schwab.) 5. Contribute enough to your 401(k) in 2024 to get your full employer match Speaking of retirement savings, if you\u2019re not yet contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match from your employer, a refund can make that easier. Say you get $3,000 back. You can put that money in a high-yield savings account to earn interest. Then, on your workplace 401(k) site, change your paycheck contribution levels so that by the end of the year you will have contributed $3,000 more in pre-tax money than you otherwise would have. For instance, say you\u2019re paid every two weeks and you have 20 more paychecks left until the end of the year. You can boost you biweekly contributions by $150 per paycheck ($150 x 20 = $3,000). \u201cYou want to get the max match from your employer,\u201d Bronnenkant said. 6. Invest for shorter-term goals If in the next three to 10 years you expect to buy a home, take a once-in-a-lifetime trip, renovate a room, send your kids to summer camp or have any other expensive goal, you might consider investing your refund in a diversified mix of low-cost, broad market index funds. The shorter term your goal is, the less risk you want to take. If you need the money within three years, you might consider putting your refund in certificates of deposits and US Treasury bonds. But if your goal is five to 10 years out, and you\u2019re comfortable taking on some more risk and are willing to accept fluctuations in the market, Bronnenkant said, you might put no more than 30% of your refund in a stock index fund and 70% in a total market bond fund if your risk tolerance is conservative; or 50% in each if you have a moderate risk tolerance. If you plan on sending your child to college and you have a 529 plan, you can use your refund to boost your contributions to that plan, Russ said. You may also get a tax break for your contribution depending on the state where you live. 7. Have some fun Unless you\u2019re in truly dire financial straits, if you get a large refund, you might set aside a small portion to do whatever you truly enjoy. \u201cSometimes you just want to have fun and not have it be all business,\u201d Russ said. \u201cYou can set aside some of the money to have fun.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/15/success/best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_10_business_sunspots-disrupt-phones-gps-scn", "text": "Buckle up: An unusual amount of solar activity this week could disrupt some of the most important technologies society relies on. On Thursday, the US government issued its first severe geomagnetic storm watch in nearly 20 years, advising the public of \u201cat least five earth-directed coronal mass ejections\u201d as well as sunspots\u00a0covering an area 16 times wider than the earth itself. A severe geomagnetic storm, or G4, is the second-highest grade in the US government\u2019s classification system. Radiation from this activity began to hit the earth\u2019s magnetic field on Friday and will last through the weekend, said the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). On Friday evening, NOAA upgraded the storm to G5 or \u201cextreme,\u201d marking the first such event since October 2003. NOAA\u2019s warning of extreme space weather suggests the storm could trigger numerous effects for life on earth, possibly affecting the power grid as well as satellite and high frequency radio communications. Here\u2019s what that means for technology users. Communications impacts The solar activity NOAA\u2019s talking about involves the release of energy from the sun that travels through space and eventually reaches Earth. When that radiation hits the magnetic sphere surrounding the planet, it causes fluctuations in the ionosphere, a layer of the upper atmosphere. Those changes can directly affect satellites and other spacecraft in orbit, altering their orientation or potentially knocking out their electronics. Moreover, the changes to the ionosphere can block or degrade radio transmissions trying to pass through the atmosphere to reach satellites. And they can also prevent radio transmissions from successfully bouncing off the ionosphere \u2014 which some radio operators normally do to increase the range of their signals. Since GPS satellites depend on signals penetrating the ionosphere, the geomagnetic disturbance scientists are expecting could affect that critical technology used by planes, ocean-going vessels, and in the agriculture and oil and gas industries. And it could affect shortwave radio transmissions used by ships and aircraft, emergency management agencies, the military and even ham radio operators, all of whom rely on the high frequency radio airwaves that NOAA says could be scattered by the storm. \u201cGeomagnetic storms can impact infrastructure in near-Earth orbit and on Earth\u2019s surface, potentially disrupting communications, the electric power grid, navigation, radio and satellite operations,\u201d NOAA\u2019s Space Weather Prediction Center said in a release. \u201cSWPC has notified the operators of these systems so they can take protective action.\u201d What about your cellphone? Consumer wireless networks rely on different radio frequencies than the high frequency band, so it appears unlikely that the storm will directly affect cellular service. The GPS features on your phone also typically use a mix of pure GPS and cellular tower-based location tracking, so even if GPS signals are disrupted, phone users may still be able to maintain a rough location fix. So long as the underlying electrical infrastructure that supports wireless networks remains unaffected, even an extreme space weather event should result in \u201cminimal direct impact to public safety line of-sight radio and commercial cellular services \u2026 and no first-order impact to consumer electronic devices,\u201d according to researchers summarizing the findings of a 2010 study of extreme space weather conducted by NOAA and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency outlined a similar report in a 2021 presentation on space weather, finding that line-of-sight radio transmissions are generally not affected by space weather except in specific situations. The presentation did note some risks for copper cables and telephone lines based on land. In a slightly different scenario in February, NOAA noted two major solar flares. But despite \u201cwidely reported cellular network outages\u201d around the same time, the agency said, it was \u201chighly unlikely\u201d that the flares played a role\u00a0in\u00a0those blackouts. On Friday, NOAA officials reiterated that the impact to cell phones this weekend should be slim to none, unless there are broad disruptions to the power grid. \u201cWe\u2019ve not seen any evidence in the past that a space weather storm could impact that now,\u201d Brent Gordon, chief of the Space Weather Services branch for SWPC, told reporters on a conference call. \u201cIf power is not available for those, then yes, certainly, the secondary impacts from that would be great.\u201d The power grid is potentially at risk Severe space weather can jeopardize power grids, according to NOAA, whose alert this week said to expect \u201cpossible widespread voltage control problems\u201d and that \u201csome protective systems may mistakenly trip out key assets from the power grid.\u201d In 1989, a space weather event led to a massive blackout in Quebec, Canada for more than nine hours after geomagnetic fluctuations damaged transformers and other important equipment. In October, an extreme geomagnetic storm stronger than the one predicted for this weekend led to power outages in Sweden and damaged power transformers in South Africa, the SWPC said. The largest known geomagnetic storm in history, known as the Carrington Event of 1859, caused telegraph stations to spark and catch fire. A blackout of the electrical grid could have cascading effects for communications and other technologies, including cellphones. Cellular towers might lose power, as could the data centers that host websites and their information. Still, many wireless carriers providers already maintain backup power generators and mobile cellular towers that they can deploy in the event of a natural disaster or other major incident. Redundancy and resiliency are watchwords of all critical infrastructure providers, so even if the power grid did fail, consumers might have to worry more about how to keep their phones charged rather than whether they could stay online. As if to underscore that point, the US government\u2019s advice to the public on how to prepare for a space weather event largely resembles the same steps you\u2019d take in response to an extended power outage. For example, the government recommends keeping extra batteries or a hand-powered charger available for small electronic devices. Officials say you may want to disconnect electric appliances to protect them from power surges and limit your electricity usage during a solar weather event. You may also want to keep your car\u2019s gas tank at least half-full so that you do not need to visit a gas station (which needs electricity to operate the pumps).

{"id": "2024_05_12_business_fast-fashion-wedding-dresses", "text": "Wedding dress shopping may never go back to what it used to be. Instead of collecting your entire bridal entourage to spend a few hours at a boutique trying on several dresses for the perfect find at a lofty price of a $1,000 or more, some retailers are offering to make the wedding dress hunt as easy breezy as buying a T-shirt off the rack. Taking their cue from Millennials and Gen Zers who are turning stuffy traditions on their head and marking life\u2019s milestones moments \u2014 such as weddings \u2014 in their own pared down way, a string of affordable fashion brands have jumped into the weddings industry to appease thrifty shoppers with inexpensive bridal wear. Abercrombie, Forever 21, Boot Barn, Shein and Lulus, better known for their tank tops, shorts, ripped jeans, bikinis, cowboy boots and sparkly dresses tailor-made for Beyonc\u00e9 and Taylor Swift concertgoers, are trying to dress brides for much less. The move isn\u2019t a complete headscratcher. For one, it allows these mass-market brands to get their slice of the more than $100 billion US wedding industry, according to The Knot Worldwide, a wedding planning and vendor marketplace. \u201cThese companies see bridal as a natural extension of their business given that they are already present in many of these product categories,\u201d said Janine Stichter,\u00a0managing director and consumer retail and lifestyle brands analyst with global financial services and market research firm BTIG. Plus, many of their core customers are older GenZers and younger Millennials who are in the sweet spot age demographic for getting married and attending weddings, she said. \u201cThe move into wedding wear makes sense so long as it\u2019s not a distraction from their core business,\u201d Stichter said. One-stop-shop for jeans and a wedding dress Teen favorite label Abercrombie & Fitch \u2014 which has undergone a major metamorphosis by shedding its overtly sexualized marketing strategy of the past to more on-trend, age-appropriate and parent-approved clothing \u2014 is continuing its evolution, by going after brides. The retailer in March launched the A&F Wedding Shop, a collection of more than 100 pieces for brides, the bridal party and wedding guests, all priced from $80 to $150. Beyond dresses, the collection includes items such as bikinis, pajamas and skirts for other events tied to the wedding. \u201cOur customers live for the long weekend, and when we asked them about their exciting upcoming getaways, we heard so many of them speak about wedding weekends, wedding-adjacent occasions, and the all-important question of what to wear, which this collection is perfectly designed to answer,\u201d Carey Collins Krug, chief marketing officer of Abercrombie & Fitch Co., said in a statement announcing the launch. In April, fast-fashion brand Forever 21 debuted its first bridal collection, priced from $9 to about $50. The clothing includes dresses, sleepwear, accessories, such as a wedding-ready cowboy hat with a veil affixed to it. A white strapless satin and lace midi dress from its bridal shop has a pricetag of $24.29, while another altar-ready white split-hem halter midi dress will set a bride back only $27. That\u2019s a basement bargain compared to the average  wedding dress cost last year of $2,000. California-based trendy fashion chain Lulus has also got in on the act by opening its first bridal boutique, with dresses ranging from $100 to $270, in Los Angeles in February. \u201cAt Lulus, brides won\u2019t have to compromise. Attaining that luxurious look without breaking their budgets isn\u2019t a dream, it\u2019s a reality,\u201d\u00a0Crystal Landsem, Lulus CEO, said in a statement in February. The standalone bridal boutique builds on Lulus\u2019 2019 entry into wedding wear and \u201cenables the brand to offer its customer-first online experience to brides in real life,\u201d the retailer said in a press release. That\u2019s a smart move, said Allyson Rees, a senior insight strategist at trend forecasting and analytics firm WGSN, in an interview with CNN. \u201cFor these bridal collections to land with Gen Z, It\u2019s important that these brands tap into the way that Gen Z shops. Gen Z is always online, but 97% of US Gen Z still shop in-store,\u201d Rees said. \u201cWedding dresses, in particular, and the tradition of trying them on, is a rite of passage that Gen Z still want to partake in. So brands will need to create compelling in-store experiences that encourage socializing.\u201d A lot less traditional As the oldest GenZers reach marrying age in their mid-20s, they\u2019re increasingly putting their own spin on nuptials and are letting go of some antiquated traditions. Part of this is also being driven by these younger non-conforming consumers being forced into even more cost sensitivity than\u00a0Millennials. \u201cThe cost-of-living crisis has affected Gen Z, and they feel deeply insecure about their finances,\u201d said Rees. \u201cOver half are living paycheck to paycheck and a third are living with their parents. So it\u2019s no surprise that fast fashion, which has seen its market share increase over the last few years due to the cost-of-living crisis, is capitalizing on the need for affordable, on-trend wedding fashion.\u201d At the same time, wedding fashion is a lot less traditional now, she said. With wedding dresses in particular, one trend that emerged during the pandemic was the popularity of black wedding gowns. \u201cGen Z is very much picking up where Millennials left off here. So it\u2019s not uncommon for brides to wear alternative colors to white, or to change outfits several times during the course of the event. So this an area where fast fashion brands can really fill a void,\u201d Rees said. Shein, which launched in 2012 and has since ballooned into the world\u2019s biggest online-only fast-fashion seller, also sells bridal and wedding wear. Its bridal gowns cost on average between $50 and $100, up to a maximum of $200. On Memorial Day weekend, the retailer will open a wedding-related pop-up shop in Las Vegas to showcase its new bridal gowns and bridesmaid dresses. \u201cAffordable prices are important for Gen Z customers, who often balance the desire for fashionable and trendy styles with a need for options that won\u2019t break the bank,\u201d Lisa Zlotnick, spokesperson for Shein, said in an interview with CNN. \u201cAs wedding attire evolves from traditional, occasion-specific outfits to versatile, stylish pieces that can be worn on multiple occasions, we aim to ensure our offerings meet this increasing demand.\u201d Even Boot Barn, which sells cowboy boots and westernwear, has jumped on the wedding bandwagon for the first time, with its new western-themed wedding collection of bridal dresses, cowboy boots, hats and accessories priced mostly at $400 and below. \u201cThere\u2019s been a surge in country weddings and casual garden weddings coming out of the pandemic as people wanted to get married outdoors. These are also budget-friendly choices,\u201d said Isha Nicole, senior vice president of marketing with Boot Barn, in an interview. \u201cCouples are trying to move away from something that is formal and stuffy to weddings that embrace a different setting. We looked at these trends and it seemed like a right time to support our customer,\u201d Nicole said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/12/business/fast-fashion-wedding-dresses/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "business"}}

The probe is yet another complication for the social media platform, which is already facing the threat of a potential US ban or a forced divestment from its Chinese parent company. The sources said that the FTC is probing TikTok over an alleged violation of the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection rule, which requires companies to notify parents and obtain consent before collecting data from children under 13. The agency is also investigating whether TikTok violated a portion of the FTC Act that prohibits \u201cunfair or deceptive\u201d business practices, the sources said, in denying that TikTok user data could be accessed by individuals in China. The FTC could bring a suit against TikTok or settle with the company in the coming weeks, according to one of the sources. Politico reported news of the probe earlier. When asked about the investigation, FTC Director of Public Affairs Douglas Farrar replied: \u201cNo comment.\u201d TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The FTC probe comes as TikTok faces an existential threat in the US. Earlier this month, a bipartisan group in the US House of Representatives voted to pass a law forcing TikTok to be sold by ByteDance or face a ban from US app stores. The bill is now before the Senate, and President Joe Biden has said he would sign it if it gets to his desk. Senate leaders, however, have indicated they are taking a deliberate approach \u2014\u00a0which could lead to delays or even potentially doom the House bill. The short-form video company, owned by Chinese firm ByteDance, has denied assertions that its app poses a national security threat to US citizens.

Cybersecurity experts say Chinese laws require ByteDance to cooperate with that country\u2019s intelligence demands\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a fact that, given ByteDance\u2019s ownership of TikTok, could hypothetically put US user data at risk. To address that issue, TikTok has taken steps to store its US user data on cloud servers controlled by US tech giant Oracle and established internal protocols limiting access by non-US employees. TikTok acknowledged to Congress in 2022 that employees based in China could access US user data, following a report that year by BuzzFeed News that ByteDance employees had accessed that information on multiple occasions. TikTok CEO Shou Chew, in his first appearance before Congress last year, also acknowledged that several ByteDance employees were fired for spying on certain US journalists as part of a \u201cmisguided attempt\u201d to hunt down leakers within the company.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/ftc-tiktok-probe-privacy-and-security/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "business"}}

Catsimatidis said the station received a letter in January 2021 from election technology company Dominion Voting Systems, which has been the target of baseless vote rigging claims by right-wing media figures, including Giuliani.\u00a0WABC instructed its on-air hosts, including Giuliani, to avoid the subject, Catsimatidis said. \u201cGuiliani has admitted repeatedly over the past few days that he agreed not to speak about Dominion,\u201d\u00a0Catsimatidis said.\u00a0\u201cHowever, he was also warned numerous times, particularly in the past few months, to refrain from\u00a0any\u00a0allegations of electronic voting manipulation surrounding the 2020 election.\u201d But on Wednesday, a Bloomberg News article\u00a0highlighted\u00a0Giuliani had doubled down on\u00a0potentially\u00a0defamatory comments about\u00a0two\u00a0Georgia\u00a0poll\u00a0workers\u00a0who had previously won a $148 million judgment against Giuliani, Catsimatidis\u00a0said. Giuliani was sent a letter the same day, reminding him to avoid the subject on-air,\u00a0Catsimatidis said, though this, too, was ignored, with Giuliani again broaching the subject on his show that same day. Later that night, Giuliani allegedly texted\u00a0Catsimatidis saying, \u201cI am disregarding every order given in this letter.\u201d Giuliani was ultimately suspended\u00a0from the station\u00a0on\u00a0Friday\u00a0for\u00a0violating the agreement and refusing to adhere to company policy,\u00a0Catsimatidis\u00a0said.\u00a0Giuliani\u2019s talk show was no longer listed on the WABC schedule Monday, and his show page had been scrubbed from the website. The suspension could add to the already massive financial woes plaguing Giuliani, who is on the hook for millions in legal fees\u00a0in addition to the nearly $150 million he owes the Georgia election workers.\u00a0Last week, Catsimatidis said that Giuliani \u201cgave me an ultimatum. He texted me\u00a0that I had to double his airtime and\u00a0compensation\u00a0by May\u00a028. \u00a0I told him I wanted to sit down in person to discuss this.\u201d The false claims of voter fraud in the 2020 election that ricocheted through right-wing media have resulted in multiple high-profile defamation lawsuits, including Fox News\u2019 settlement with Dominion for a record $787 million. Last month, the far-right cable channel One America News settled with another voting technology company, Smartmatic, for its airing of false claims. The financial details of that settlement were not revealed. Giuliani has\u00a0also\u00a0been criminally charged in\u00a0Georgia\u00a0and\u00a0Arizona\u00a0over lies related to overturning the 2020 presidential election.\u00a0Catsimatidis told CNN that he learned from a New York Post article that the former mayor is also being paid by Newsmax, \u201cwhich is trying to make a case against us with Dominion.\u201d \u201cI won\u2019t jeopardize WABC over stupid things like that,\u201d he said. On\u00a0Friday, the same day as his suspension, Giuliani published an episode of his YouTube-based talk show, \u201cAmerica\u2019s Mayor Live,\u201d seemingly in response\u00a0to reports of\u00a0his suspension and his show\u2019s cancelation.\u00a0Giuliani decried WABC\u2019s decision as a violation of free speech. \u201cYou fired me to interfere in the election \u2014 because once a Democrat, always a Democrat \u2014 and you\u2019re sucking up to them, John, and don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re not,\u201d Giuliani ranted on his show. Giuliani did not respond to a CNN request for comment. Catsimatidis told CNN that he had not yet made a decision whether to terminate Giuliani. The station owner said that as a rule he will not fire someone unless he has had a chance to sit down with them face to face. As\u00a0of Monday,\u00a0he has not had a chance to meet with Giuliani, who is in Florida and said\u00a0he can\u2019t return to New York City,\u00a0due to\u00a0a bad knee. Catsimatidis\u00a0said he is willing to sit down with Giuliani should the former mayor be willing to do so but if\u00a0that does not happen,\u00a0he may rethink Giuliani\u2019s employment status. \u201cThe number one item is the fact that he started to talk about the electronic machines and that\u2019s not negotiable,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s absolutely zero, no way will we allow that to happen.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/media/rudy-giuliani-wabc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_12_tech_apple-maryland-workers-strike", "text": "Apple Store workers in Towson, Maryland, the first of the tech giant\u2019s retail employees to unionize, made history again by voting late Saturday in favor of authorizing a strike. The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace\u00a0Workers Coalition of Organized Retail Employees (IAM CORE), the union representing the workers, said in a news release the vote \u201cunderscores the frustrations among workers regarding unresolved workplace issues.\u201d Employees at the store in Towson, a suburb of Baltimore, have been in contract negotiations with Apple management since last year over a number of issues, including the store\u2019s \u201cunpredictable\u201d scheduling practices and wages that don\u2019t \u201calign with the area\u2019s cost of living.\u201d \u201cThis vote today is the first step in demonstrating our solidarity and sends a clear message to Apple,\u201d said members of the union\u2019s negotiating committee on Saturday.\u00a0\u201cThe passage of the strike sanction vote highlights IAM CORE\u2019s unwavering commitment to advocating for the rights and well-being of workers in the face of challenges.\u201d In response, Apple said in a statement to CNN that it will \u201cengage with the union representing our team in Towson respectfully and in good faith.\u201d \u201cAt Apple we work hard to provide an excellent experience for our retail team members and empower them to deliver exceptional service for our customers,\u201d an Apple spokeswoman said. \u201cWe deeply value our team members and we\u2019re proud to provide them with industry leading compensation and exceptional benefits.\u201d The union at the Towson store has not disclosed what date members would strike. Meanwhile, another vote for a store to unionize failed this weekend. Apple employees at the Mall at Short Hills store in New Jersey voted against unionizing on Saturday, according to Bloomberg. The union, known as the Communications\u00a0Workers\u00a0of America, alleged Apple engaged in illegal union-busting activity and blamed the defeat on the Apple\u2019s tactics. \u201cInstead of leaving the decision up to the workers themselves, the company turned to its usual anti-union playbook to influence the results of the election,\u201d CWA said in a statement obtained by Bloomberg. Labor issues Labor unrest has embroiled Apple and its retail stores, compounding the number of issues facing the iPhone maker including regulatory scrutiny in Washington,\u00a0sluggish sales in China and an iPad ad that massively backfired. The National Labor Relations Board last week upheld a decision alleging union-busting tactics by Apple in New York City. The labor wave hitting Apple retail stores echoes the mass organizing that began at other influential companies in the United States, such as Starbucks and Amazon. As Apple grew to become\u00a0the world\u2019s first $3 trillion company, a tight labor market from the Covid-19 pandemic exposed labor conditions and inequalities facing workers in stores and warehouses. \u201cIt speaks to a growing frustration among workers and also a contagion in labor activity, which is when one group of workers stands up and inspires others,\u201d Kate Bronfenbrenner, the director of Labor Education Research at Cornell\u2019s School of Industrial and Labor Relations, previously told CNN.

{"id": "2024_05_13_tech_australia-us-undersea-drones-ml-hnk-intl", "text": "Ghost Shark and Manta Ray protect the undersea realm. Sounds like the plot of a future Marvel movie, but in actual fact, it\u2019s what could be the future of Pacific naval defenses. Ghost Shark and Manta Ray are the names of prototype uncrewed underwater vehicles \u2013 UUVs or drones \u2013 introduced recently by Australia and the United States respectively. Experts say the submersibles could represent the future of undersea warfare, showing the ability to exert power\u00a0while minimizing the danger to human life. The use of drones in aerial warfare has become commonplace. The US used them extensively during conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan beginning in the 1990s, and newer, cheaper drones have become key pieces of military hardware for both sides in Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Kyiv has also built naval surface drones, which have inflicted heavy losses on the much larger and more expensive ships of Russia\u2019s Black Sea Fleet. Aerial and surface sea drones can be controlled using satellites and light and radio waves. But those don\u2019t function in the same way in the depths. A 2023 study published in the Swiss journal Sensors points out that underwater communications require more energy but still see significant data loss to variables including water temperature, salinity and depth. Makers of the new generation of military UUVs aren\u2019t saying how they would overcome communications problems. But when Australia unveiled Ghost Shark last month, it called the prototypes \u201cthe most advanced undersea autonomous vehicles in the world.\u201d \u201cGhost Shark will provide Navy with a stealthy, long-range autonomous undersea warfare capability that can conduct persistent intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance (ISR) and strike,\u201d a statement from the Australian Defense Ministry said, adding that it expects the first production models to be delivered by the end of next year. Australian officials and those from manufacturer Anduril Australia said they could not share any of the specs on Ghost Shark as those remain classified. But they touted the speed with which the submersible has gone from idea to testing, with the program having started just two years ago. \u201cBeing ahead of schedule, on budget, it\u2019s pretty unheard of,\u201d Shane Arnott, Anduril\u2019s senior vice president for engineering, told reporters. \u201cDelivering the first Ghost Shark prototype ahead of schedule sets a new standard for capability development at the speed of need,\u201d Australia\u2019s chief defense scientist, Tanya Monro, said in a statement. Emma Salisbury, a fellow at the British think tank Council on Geostrategy, said the Ghost Shark seems much like the Orca extra-large UUV being developed in the US. \u201cI assume that they are all intended for roughly similar mission sets \u2013 persistent intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance and strike capability, particularly in the anti-submarine domain,\u201d Salisbury said. The US Navy called the Boeing-built Orca UUV \u201ca cutting-edge, autonomous, unmanned diesel-electric submarine with a modular payload section to execute a variety of missions\u201d in a December news release on the delivery of a first Orca test platform, an early prototype. Having a modular payload means the Orca in theory could carry different weapons varieties depending upon the task or be fitted with specialized equipment for reconnaissance or possibly intelligence gathering. The release said the Pentagon would acquire five more of the UUVs, without giving a timetable. But the US Orca has been in the works for more than a decade, the Navy release said, a sharp contrast to the speed with which Australia has developed Ghost Shark. Chris Brose, Anduril\u2019s chief strategy officer, said the company and Australia are in the \u201cprocess of proving\u201d that \u201cthese kinds of capabilities can be built much faster, much cheaper, much more intelligently.\u201d Anduril Australia said the entirely domestically developed Ghost Shark would be made available for export after it joins the Australian naval fleet. Manta Ray trials Meanwhile, back across the Pacific, the Orca isn\u2019t the only UUV being developed in the US. America\u2019s latest UUV entry is Northrop Grumman\u2019s Manta Ray, a prototype of which was tested off Southern California in February and March. The Defense Advanced Research Products Agency (DARPA), the Pentagon branch in charge of developing new technologies, says Manta Ray\u2019s strength is in its modularity, the ability to switch out payloads depending on the mission. It can be broken down and fit into five standard shipping containers, move to where it\u2019s going to be deployed, and reassembled in the field, according to Northrop Grumman. The prototype was built in Maryland and then reassembled on the California coast. \u201cThe combination of cross-country modular transportation, in-field assembly, and subsequent deployment demonstrates a first-of-kind capability for an extra-large UUV,\u201d Kyle Woerner, who heads the Manta Ray program at DARPA, said in an agency news release. He also noted the modular transport method means the Manta Ray can save internal energy for its mission, rather than using it to get to the deployment site. Like the Orca, the Manta Ray hasn\u2019t come together as quickly as Ghost Shark. Its program began in 2020 and DARPA didn\u2019t give a goal for the Manta Ray \u2013 or some variant of it \u2013 to join the US fleet. \u201cDARPA is engaging with the U.S. Navy on the next steps for testing and transition of this technology,\u201d the agency\u2019s release said. Meanwhile, China, named by the US military as its \u201cpacing threat\u201d in the Pacific, is also making advances in UUVs, Salisbury said. \u201cWhile details are scarce, as with most Chinese capabilities, they have been developing them for at least 15 years and likely now have something similar to the Orca (but with torpedoes) in the testing phase,\u201d she said. Submarine expert H I Sutton says on his Covert Shores website that, according to an analysis of open-source intelligence, Beijing is believed to have at least six extra-large UUVs under development. Besides Australia, the US and China, other countries working on UUVs include Canada, France, India, Iran, Israel, North Korea, Norway, Russia, South Korea, Ukraine and the United Kingdom, according to Sutton.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/tech/australia-us-undersea-drones-ml-hnk-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_07_business_india-economy-modi-ambani-adani-influence-intl-hnk", "text": "In March, a quiet coastal town\u00a0in the western Indian state of Gujarat could have\u00a0given both Davos and Coachella a run for their money. That\u2019s when billionaires and movie stars from around the world jetted to Jamnagar, overwhelming its small airport with private planes and chartered flights. They were all there to party with Asia\u2019s richest man, Mukesh Ambani. The 67-year old chairman of India\u2019s most valuable private company Reliance Industries had thrown a lavish pre-wedding bash for his son, welcoming around 1,200 guests from Silicon Valley, Bollywood and beyond. Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates and\u00a0Ivanka Trump were among the many high-profile celebrities in attendance. The three-day celebration, which saw performances by popstar Rihanna and magician David Blaine,\u00a0transfixed India and further underscored Ambani\u2019s growing global clout. But Ambani was not the only Indian businessman at the bash whose staggering influence and riches are reshaping the world\u2019s most populous country. Fellow billionaire Gautam Adani, founder of the Adani group, was also invited. The infrastructure tycoon has stunned the world with his supercharged rise in the last decade. In 2022, he briefly ousted Jeff Bezos as the world\u2019s second-wealthiest person.  \u201cThey are phenomenal \u2026 entrepreneurs, who have been able to sustain steady growth and development\u00a0in a vibrant yet sometimes chaotic political and business environment that exists in India,\u201d said Rohit Lamba, an economist at Pennsylvania State University. Investors have been cheering the duo\u2019s ability to adroitly bet on sectors prioritized for development by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, currently campaigning for his third consecutive term to lead India. The South Asian country is poised to become a 21st-century economic powerhouse, offering a\u00a0real alternative to China for investors hunting for growth and manufacturers looking to reduce risks in their supply chains. Reliance Industries and the Adani Group are sprawling conglomerates worth over $200 billion each, with established businesses in sectors ranging from fossil fuels and clean energy to media and technology. As a result, these three men \u2014 Modi, Ambani and Adani \u2014 are playing a fundamental role in shaping the economic superpower India will become in the coming decades. The new Rockefellers In India\u2019s financial capital Mumbai, the fingerprints of the two businessmen are everywhere, starting from the bustling international airport, which is operated by Adani. Their names are plastered across the city \u2014 from the bubble lettering of the Adani Group logo propped up beside highways to high-rise apartment buildings branded with Adani Realty, to cultural institutions named after the Ambani clan. Some spaces need no names or bright labels, but their affiliations are just as obvious. Everyone in Mumbai knows who lives in Antilia \u2014 the personal skyscraper of Ambani and his family, which reportedly cost $2 billion to build and boasts a spa, three helipads and a 50-seat theater. The 27-story building sits on a street dubbed \u201cBillionaires\u2019 Row,\u201d its jutting geometric architecture looming over the neighborhood. The kind of power and influence these Indian tycoons enjoy has been seen before in other countries experiencing periods of rapid industrialisation. Both Ambani and Adani are often compared by journalists to John D Rockefeller, who became America\u2019s first billionaire during the Gilded Age, a 30-year period in the last decades of the 19th century. During those decades, industrialists saw their fortunes ascend to staggering heights thanks to the rapid expansion of trains, factories and urban centers across America. Other famous names including Frick, Astor, Carnegie, and Vanderbilt also shaped the country\u2019s infrastructure. More recently in Asia, \u201cchaebols\u201d or\u00a0giant family-run conglomerates have dominated the South Korean economy for decades and many of them, including Samsung and Hyundai, have become\u00a0global leaders in semiconductors and autos. \u201cIndia is in the middle of something that America and lots of other countries have already gone through. Britain in the 1820s, South Korea in the 1960s and 70s, and you could argue China in the 2000s,\u201d said James Crabtree, the author of The Billionaire Raj, a book about India\u2019s wealthy. It is \u201cnormal\u201d for developing nations to go through such a period of rapid growth, which sees \u201cincome accumulation at the very top, rising inequality and lots of crony capitalism,\u201d he added. The Indian economy has many of those characteristics. Worth $3.7 trillion in 2023, it is the world\u2019s fifth largest economy, jumping four spots in the rankings during Modi\u2019s decade in office and leapfrogging the United Kingdom. It is comfortably placed to expand at an annual rate of at least 6% in the coming few years, but analysts say the country should\u00a0be targeting growth of\u00a08% or more\u00a0if it wants to become an economic superpower. Sustained expansion will push India higher up the ranks of the world\u2019s biggest economies, with some observers forecasting the South Asian nation to become number three behind only the US and China by 2027. Despite these successes, soaring youth unemployment and inequality remain stubbornly persistent problems. In 2022, the country ranked a lowly 147 on gross domestic product (GDP) per person, a measure of living standards, according to the World Bank. Coal to solar, oil to internet To spur growth, the Modi government has begun a massive infrastructure transformation by spending billions on building roads, ports, airports and railways. It is also heavily promoting digital connectivity, which can improve both commerce and daily life. Both Adani and Ambani have become key allies as the country\u00a0embarks\u00a0on this revolution. \u201cThese conglomerates are very, very important and very well connected,\u201d said Guido Cozzi, professor of macroeconomics at the University of St Gallen in Switzerland, noting that both the Adani Group and Reliance Industries were founded years before Modi came to power. \u201cThey are not\u00a0typical stagnant monopolistic conglomerates. They are pretty dynamic,\u201d Cozzi said. Not only are\u00a0they playing \u201can important role\u201d in building infrastructure, which helps \u201cgrowth directly,\u201d the two business groups are also helping the country expand \u201cindirectly\u201d by boosting connectivity through digital innovation, he explained. Reliance was founded by Ambani\u2019s father, Dhirubhai, as a small yarn trading firm in Mumbai in 1957. Over the next few decades, it grew into a colossal conglomerate spanning energy, petrochemicals and telecommunications. After his father\u2019s death, and following a bitter feud with his younger brother, Ambani inherited the\u00a0company\u2019s main oil and petrochemicals assets. He then spent billions transforming it into a tech juggernaut. In less than a decade, Ambani has not only upended India\u2019s telecom sector, but also become a top player in sectors ranging from media to retail. His ambition and breathless pace of expansion is matched by Adani,\u00a0a college drop-out who now helms businesses ranging from ports and power to defense and aerospace. A first-generation entrepreneur, the 62-year-old began his career with diamond trading, before setting up a commodity trading business in 1988, which later evolved into Adani Enterprises Limited (AEL). According to a January note by American brokerage firm Cantor Fitzgerald, AEL \u201cis at the core of everything India wants to accomplish.\u201d The company functions as an incubator for Adani\u2019s businesses. Many have been spun out and become leading players in their respective sectors. According to Cantor, the firm\u2019s current focus on airports, roads and energy make it \u201ca unique long-term investment opportunity.\u201d And while both the barons built much of their fortune from fossil fuels, they are now investing billions in clean energy. Their green energy pivot comes at a time when India has set itself some\u00a0ambitious climate goals.  The world\u2019s fastest growing major economy has other conglomerates as well. The 156-year-old Tata Group wields immense power over various key sectors ranging from steel to aviation, but it often does not invite the same scrutiny as the newer conglomerates, mainly because it is controlled by philanthropic trusts and not run as a family dynasty. \u2018Too big to ignore\u2019 Ambani and Adani are considered vocal champions of Modi. Prominent politicians from opposition parties in India have often questioned Modi\u2019s ties with India\u2019s super-rich, and the meteoric rise of Adani becoming a fraught\u00a0issue last year. In January 2023, the group was rocked by an unprecedented crisis when an American short-seller Hindenburg Research accused it of\u00a0engaging in fraud\u00a0over decades. Adani denounced Hindenburg\u2019s report as \u201cbaseless\u201d and \u201cmalicious.\u201d But that failed to halt a stunning stock market meltdown that, at one point, wiped more than $100 billion off the value of its listed companies. Political leaders from India\u2019s main opposition party ferociously questioned Adani\u2019s relationship with the prime minister, and some even said that they were punished for pursuing the issue. Since then, Adani has made a remarkable comeback, with shares in some of his companies touching record highs. Despite the scandal, the group has also managed to attract billions from new foreign investors, including US private equity firm\u00a0GQG Partners. \u201cWhile that report brought to light serious concerns, we believe the company has taken actions to reduce liquidity risk, improve governance, and increase transparency,\u201d Cantor said in its report. \u201cThus, at this juncture, we believe Adani is too big to ignore, and for India, we believe the country needs Adani as much as Adani needs the country.\u201d Now, as India votes, Modi\u2019s perceived relationship with the billionaires is once again being questioned by rivals. Prasanna Tantri, associate professor of finance at the Indian School of Business, said he does not have \u201creason to believe that things have become worse than before\u201d when it comes to crony capitalism in India. Some processes, particularly more transparency in allocation of India\u2019s natural resources and the overhauling of the country\u2019s bankruptcy laws, have been important reforms under Modi, he added. Experts say that some amount of closeness between politicians and business elite can help in growing the nation faster. \u201cThe optimal level of corruption in an economy is never zero,\u201d said Crabtree, adding that India needs to build more independent institutions that can keep it under control. However, unchecked dominance of\u00a0such enormous groups may choke competition and innovation, and ultimately lead to stagnation in an economy. The new government needs to encourage entrepreneurship and innovation by making it easier for smaller firms to raise money and getting rid of archaic laws, including land and labor rules, that can get in the way of doing business. Failing to do so, could stifle India\u2019s future growth. A few big conglomerates cannot absorb the million people joining the labor force every month, said Lamba, who is also co-author of Breaking the Mould, a 2023 book that examines how Asia\u2019s third largest economy can grow faster. \u201cIndia cannot grow rich before it becomes old on the back\u00a0of a few big firms like\u00a0Adani or Ambani,\u201d he said. \u201cIndia should make more firms.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/07/business/india-economy-modi-ambani-adani-influence-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_22_media_ronna-mcdaniel-nbc", "text": "NBC News on Friday announced that it had hired Ronna McDaniel, the former Republican National Committee chair who has repeatedly\u00a0attacked the network and its journalists,\u00a0assailed the\u00a0news\u00a0media as \u201cfake news\u201d and promoted false claims around the 2020\u00a0vote,\u00a0as an on-air commentator\u00a0ahead of the 2024 presidential election. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be a more important moment to have a voice like Ronna\u2019s on the team,\u201d Carrie Budoff Brown, senior vice president of politics at NBC News, said in a memo\u00a0to staff. McDaniel exited the RNC earlier this month after leading the organization since 2016. During her time as chair, McDaniel repeatedly attacked the press, which has become increasingly popular in Republican circles over the last several years as Donald Trump demonizes journalists and news institutions. McDaniel echoed many such attacks, labeling the press as \u201cfake news\u201d and calling the media \u201ccorrupt.\u201d At times, she even targeted NBC News\u00a0and MSNBC\u00a0with dishonest attacks. In 2019, for instance, McDaniel accused Richard Engel, NBC News\u2019 chief foreign correspondent, of \u201cactively cheering for an economic downturn.\u201d \u201cHow can NBC let him keep his job when he\u2019s made his bias so clear?\u201d McDaniel asked. McDaniel has a lengthier history attacking the progressive cable news channel MSNBC, which she will appear on in her new role. In recent years, she has repeatedly attacked the channel for \u201cspreading lies\u201d and blasted those she described as the network\u2019s \u201cprimetime propagandists.\u201d An NBC spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment about her attacks on the news media and NBC. In her role as RNC chief, McDaniel also fanned the flames of election denialism after the 2020 presidential contest. McDaniel was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d The Michigan Department of State\u2019s office condemned her claims of supposed voter fraud in the wake of the election, stating they had \u201cno merit.\u201d\u00a0The state\u2019s \u201celections were conducted fairly, effectively and transparently and are an accurate reflection of the will of Michigan voters,\u201d it said in a\u00a0detailed fact check\u00a0posted online. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Chris Wallace last year, McDaniel defended her claims of voting \u201cirregularity\u201d in the election. \u201cI think saying that there were problems with 2020 is very real. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s election denying,\u201d McDaniel told Wallace. \u201cI\u2019m from Wayne County. We had a woman send a note saying I\u2019m being told to backdate ballots. We had to look into that. That\u2019s deeply concerning. When you have friends who are poll-watching and being kicked out, that\u2019s deeply concerning. We have every right to look at that.\u201d In the interview,\u00a0Wallace pressed McDaniel if she believed Biden legitimately won the election. \u201cI think there were lots of problems with 2020. Ultimately, he won the election\u00a0but there were lots of problems with the 2020 election,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think he won it fair. I don\u2019t. I\u2019m not going to say that.\u201d NBC\u2019s hiring of McDaniel, however, plays into a recent trend at the\u00a0network\u2019s outlets, which has seemingly softened its stance on Trump as he inches toward the Republican nomination for president. Earlier this month, CNBC hosted Trump for a lengthy phone interview in which the network\u2019s anchors allowed him to peddle lies and conspiracy theories on air\u00a0without scrutiny. MSNBC has even started carrying Trump\u2019s remarks live on television, a practice that the network boasted for years it would not do. Star host Rachel Maddow, who has said carrying Trump\u2019s lies\u00a0on the air\u00a0is dangerous, even objected to the network broadcasting a recent speech from the presumptive Republican nominee, calling it \u201cirresponsible.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/22/media/ronna-mcdaniel-nbc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "business"}}

With inflation heating up again, the Federal Reserve is in no position to consider lowering interest rates at its upcoming meetings. That\u2019s helped push the average fixed rate on 30-year mortgages above 7.2% after five straight weeks of increases. Consumers aren\u2019t expecting mortgage rates to come down any time soon. Over the next year, they anticipate that mortgage rates will rise to nearly 9%. Over the next three years, they expect rates that are close to 10%. That\u2019s according to a New York Fed survey gauging consumers\u2019 expectations of the housing market, released Monday. On top of that, households are bracing for a resurgence in home prices over the next year after they had started to ease back last year. But here\u2019s the catch: Renting is also far from a bargain these days. Consumers are gearing up for even bigger increases compared to the expected rise in mortgage rates over the next year, the New York Fed survey found. The issue of rent affordability is particularly pronounced in New York City, where housing costs have always been notoriously high compared to other parts of the country, absent a brief respite during the pandemic. But what\u2019s making the burden weigh even heavier is rents in the city grew seven times faster than wages last year, according to an analysis Zillow published Tuesday. That\u2019s the biggest gap across 50 of the nation\u2019s largest metro areas. Nationally, however, Americans\u2019 wages increased at a faster pace than their rents last year. The Fed\u2019s role:\u00a0The strong jobs market the Fed has sought to preserve while reining in inflation is working against New York City renters, Kenny Lee, a senior economist at Zillow-owned StreetEasy, said in a statement on Tuesday. That\u2019s because new home construction in the city is especially struggling to keep up with the demand coming from the availability of jobs. Would the situation be any different had  the Fed been quicker to raise interest rates to fend off rising inflation back in 2022 when it hit a multi-decade high? \u201cIt\u2019s possible that inflation would have gotten back to target quicker if the Fed had hiked sooner,\u201d Aditya Bhave, senior US economist at Bank of America, told CNN. If that happened, the central bank may not have needed to keep rates at the current high levels for so long. That could have helped prevent mortgage rates from rising as high as they are now because, as Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said in a Bloomberg TV interview Tuesday, housing is \u201ctraditionally the most interest-rate-sensitive sector of the economy.\u201d However, Bhave said \u201chindsight is 20/20 and a lot of the inflation was caused by supply disruptions that the Fed couldn\u2019t have prevented.\u201d The other side of the equation is that had the Fed not kept interest rates at near-zero levels for two years, many current homeowners who locked in low rates wouldn\u2019t have been able to afford to own a home. One of the dangers now is that the many Americans delaying plans to buy a home may not \u201cget to participate in home value appreciation, which could affect the distribution of wealth in the long run,\u201d Bhave said. Slaughterhouse cleaning company fined $649,000 for employing child workers A janitorial company has been fined $649,000 after an investigation found it hired minors for dangerous jobs cleaning slaughterhouses, the United States\u00a0Department of Labor said Monday. Fayette Janitorial Service had employed at least 24 children, including those as young as 13, according to the DOL investigation. The minors had been working overnight shifts at two separate slaughter facilities, according to the DOL. Federal labor law bans children from certain jobs in slaughtering and meat packaging plants, including using or cleaning machinery, due to the hazardous conditions. This isn\u2019t the first instance of recent child labor violations in the meatpacking industry. Children were found working at Seaboard Triumph Foods Plant in Sioux City, Iowa, and at a Perdue Farms poultry processing facility in Accomac, Virginia, according to the DOL. \u201cMinors were used to clean dangerous kill floor equipment such as head splitters, jaw pullers, meat bandsaws, and neck clippers,\u201d the Labor Department said in\u00a0a February news release\u00a0describing the findings of its investigation. Perdue \u201cterminated our contract with Fayette Janitorial Services prior to this court filing,\u201d a company spokesperson told CNN in a February statement, adding, \u201cunderage labor has no place in our business or our industry,\u201d the statement continued. Seaboard, a pork processor, told CNN in a statement that it \u201cimmediately terminated all contracts with Fayette,\u201d upon learning of the Labor Department\u2019s allegations. \u201cSuch conduct, if true, is in violation of our company\u2019s policies and procedures and in violation of the strict commitments made by Fayette in their contract,\u201d according to the statement. \u201cOur company will continue to take all appropriate follow-up measures to protect workers and ensure accountability for compliance of its contractors with labor and employment laws,\u201d Seaboard said. Instances of illegal child labor\u00a0have been growing in recent years, and other contractors have been fined over employing minors. Last year,\u00a0Packers Sanitation Services paid $1.5 million\u00a0in civil penalties for employing minors in hazardous occupations and having them working overnight shifts, according to a DOL investigation.

TikTok sues to block prospective US app ban TikTok sued Tuesday to block a US law that could force a nationwide ban of the popular app, following through on legal threats the company issued after President Joe Biden\u00a0signed the legislation\u00a0last month, reports CNN\u2019s Brian Fung. The court challenge sets up a historic legal battle, one that will determine whether US security concerns about TikTok\u2019s links to China can trump the First Amendment rights of TikTok\u2019s 170 million US users. The stakes of the case are existential for TikTok. If it loses, TikTok could be banned from US app stores unless its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, sells the app to a non-Chinese entity by mid-January 2025. In its\u00a0petition filed Tuesday\u00a0at the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, TikTok and Bytedance allege the law is unconstitutional because it stifles Americans\u2019 speech and prevents them from accessing lawful information. The lawsuit follows\u00a0years of US allegations\u00a0that TikTok\u2019s ties to China could potentially expose Americans\u2019 personal information to the Chinese government. Read more here.

{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl", "text": "Sam Altman has agreed to return to lead OpenAI, the company said in a Tuesday post on X, just days after his surprise ouster as chief executive sparked an employee revolt that threatened to undermine what has been the leading company in the fledgling artificial intelligence industry. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman wrote that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft, which is the ChatGPT maker\u2019s biggest financial backer. The announcement appears to bring to an end days of chaos for the AI industry that included negotiations over who should lead OpenAI and how the firm should be run, as well as broader discussions about just how fast the arms race to develop AI technology should be moving. The details of Altman\u2019s firing and re-hiring remain murky. In its announcement Friday, OpenAI claimed that Altman had been insufficiently \u201ccandid\u201d with the board. That ambiguous language sent the rumor mill flying. But a key factor in Altman\u2019s ouster was the presence of\u00a0tensions between Altman, who favored pushing AI development more aggressively, and members of the original OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the crisis. As of Monday morning, Nadella had announced that Altman, along with fellow OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, would be joining Microsoft to lead a new AI research division. OpenAI said it had hired former Twitch chief Emmett Shear as interim CEO. But then hundreds of OpenAI employees, nearly the company\u2019s entire staff, threatened to leave, potentially for Microsoft, if the company\u2019s board didn\u2019t resign and reinstate Altman as CEO. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it invested billions in to help bolster its ambitions in developing AI, which many in Silicon Valley think will be the most important wave of technological advancement in the coming decades. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Microsoft CEO\u00a0Satya Nadella said on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d Altman\u2019s vision to quickly roll out and commercialize AI tools also appears to have won out. Publicly, Altman has long cautioned about risks posed by AI, and he\u202fhas pledged to lawmakers and customers that he would move OpenAI forward responsibly. \u201cIs [AI] gonna be like the printing press that diffused knowledge, power and learning widely across the landscape that empowered ordinary, everyday individuals that led to greater flourishing, that led above all to greater liberty?\u201d he said in a May Senate subcommittee hearing pressing for regulation. \u201cOr is it gonna be more like the atom bomb \u2014 huge technological breakthrough, but the consequences (severe, terrible) continue to haunt us to this day?\u201d But inside the company, Altman had been pushing to bring products to market more quickly and to sell them for a profit. Altman announced a few weeks ago at OpenAI\u2019s first-ever developer day that the company would make tools available so anyone could create their own version of ChatGPT. OpenAI has also worked with Microsoft to roll out ChatGPT-like technology across Microsoft\u2019s products. OpenAI and iPhone designer Jony Ive had also reportedly\u202fbeen in talks to raise $1 billion from Japanese conglomerate SoftBank for an AI device to replace the smartphone. \u2014 CNN\u2019s Juliana Liu and Diksha Madhok contributed reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_11_business_credit-card-late-fees-regulation-cfpb", "text": "A federal judge in Fort Worth, Texas, on Friday blocked a new Biden administration rule that would prohibit credit card companies from charging customers late fees higher than $8. US District Judge Mark T. Pittman, an appointee of former President Donald Trump, granted a preliminary injunction to several business and banking organizations that allege the new rule violates several federal statutes. These organizations, led by the right-leaning US Chamber of Commerce, sued the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau after the rule was finalized in March. The rule, which was set to go into effect Tuesday, would save consumers about $10 billion per year by cutting fees from an average of $32, the CFPB estimated. A preliminary injunction means the rule can\u2019t go into effect until a hearing is held where the case can be adjudicated in greater detail. \u201cThe credit card lobby\u2019s lawsuit is an attempt to derail a rule that will save families $10 billion each year in order to continue making tens of billions of dollars in profits by charging borrowers late fees that far exceed their actual costs,\u201d a CFPB spokesperson told CNN in a statement. \u201cConsumers will shoulder $800 million in late fees every month that the rule is delayed \u2014 money that pads the profit margins of the largest credit card issuers. We will continue to defend this rule so that working families can stop paying excessive late fees that Congress banned more than a decade ago.\u201d Maria Monaghan, the counsel for the US Chamber of Commerce Litigation Center, said in a statement Friday that the ruling was \u201ca major win for\u00a0responsible consumers who pay their credit card bills on time and businesses that want to provide affordable credit,\u201d and that it would \u201ccontinue to hold the CFPB accountable in court.\u201d \u201cIt is disappointing that the court has granted this last-ditch effort by the banks to prevent these critical limits on credit card late fees from going into effect next week,\u201d said Chuck Bell, advocacy program director for non-profit Consumer Reports. \u201cCredit card companies have been bilking consumers out of billions of dollars in excessive late fees for far too long.\u201d The rule, first proposed in February 2023, is part of a broader push by the Biden administration to eliminate \u201cjunk fees,\u201d considered hidden or misleading charges to consumers. The\u00a0new rule would apply to large credit card issuers\u00a0\u2014 those with more than 1 million accounts. These companies represent more than 95% of total outstanding credit card debt, according to the CFPB. The push to target credit card fees is part of the Biden administration\u2019s efforts to ease financial burdens for many Americans. Some borrowers, especially millennials and those with lower incomes, have fallen behind on their credit card debt\u00a0following more than two years of high inflation. The new rule also intended to close a 2010 loophole the CFPB says has been \u201cexploited\u201d by credit card companies to hike fees on late payments. According to a national Consumer Reports survey published in September, one in five American adults said they had paid a credit card late fee in the previous 12 months. Eighty-two percent said they supported lowering the maximum late fee.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/11/business/credit-card-late-fees-regulation-cfpb/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_08_tech_apple-ipad-pro-ad-backlash-cec", "text": "When an ad goes viral, it\u2019s usually for one of two reasons \u2014\u00a0it resonates so deeply with viewers that they can\u2019t stop talking about it \u2026 or it makes people so upset they rush to social media to voice their outrage. An Apple ad for its new iPad Pro seems to fall into the latter category. Posted on social media Tuesday by Apple CEO Tim Cook, the ad starts off as a sort of time capsule for human creativity. There\u2019s a metronome. A record player. Then the lights come on in a warehouse-like room, where you see those items and dozens of other creative tools sitting on a metal slab in the center of the shot. There\u2019s also a CRT TV, cans of paint, a globe of the Earth, a piano, an \u201880s arcade video game, a sculptural bust of a human head and a trumpet. Another giant metal slab hangs ominously above it all. As we hear the opening words of \u201cAll I Ever Need Is You,\u201d a 1972 single by Sonny & Cher, the metal slab starts descending. The items are in a giant hydraulic press, and within about 40 seconds everything will be gone \u2014\u00a0crushed under tons of force in an often dramatic fashion. After the destruction, the hydraulic press starts rising again. The debris is now gone. In its place is a shiny, new iPad Pro. A voiceover says, \u201cThe most powerful iPad ever is also the thinnest.\u201d Cher closes out the minute-long spot, crooning \u201cAll I ever need is you.\u201d Videos of hydraulic presses demolishing everything from electronics to candy have become very popular in the past few years, in part due to the often mesmerizing nature of the way things collapse under pressure. Apple is seemingly trying to capitalize on this trend while making a point about how its new iPad Pro is so powerful it can replace other means of creative expression. But for many viewers, the ad doesn\u2019t land the right note. \u201cI\u2019m not sure \u2018wanton destruction of all the good and beautiful things is (sic) this world\u2019 was really the vibe you were trying for,\u201d says one commenter on X. \u201cI can\u2019t relate to this video at all. It lacks any respect for creative equipment and mocks the creators,\u201d says another. CNN has reached out to Apple for comment. Others say that even though they understand what the ad is trying to say, it doesn\u2019t resonate with them. \u201cIt\u2019s a creative concept & good execution, but wow the ad made me surprising (sic) sad!\u201d says one X user. \u201cThe song choice also seems to especially idolize tech over real life. Now I just want to avoid screens & spend more time enjoying the world offline.\u201d \u201cIt should have been about capturing and honoring the essence of what\u2019s so special about all of those things and experiences to bring them together in a device, not crushing the soul out of them,\u201d says another person on X. Many people agreed with this sentiment, saying the ad would have been better in reverse. This isn\u2019t the first time an ad may not have landed the way a company expected \u2014 think the infamous Peloton holiday ad or the Kendall Jenner ad for Pepsi. But with fears that AI could replace workers in many industries \u2014 and the increasingly worrying research about how prolonged social media use affect us \u2014 many consumers are growing wary of technology. \u201cThis ad perfectly encapsulates the insight that people think technology is killing everything we ever found joy in.

It offers 75 exercises, designed to test a range of skills, with videos showing users how to complete them. Performances are automatically scored by artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The data can then be accessed by clubs, allowing their scouts to peruse scores for viable talent, honing their search with a variety of filters; from age and gender to position on the pitch. The app currently has two English Premier League (EPL) partners, Chelsea and Burnley, and clubs can tailor their in-app trials to meet specific needs and set their own benchmarks by having their academy players complete the same drills. \u201cWe\u2019re putting that data up front to make better use of [the scouts\u2019] time,\u201d said Richard Felton-Thomas, chief operating officer of ai.io, the company behind the app. \u201cTo say [to scouts], \u2018Go over to this place today because there\u2019s three players in that game that are all actually beating your Chelsea standard\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s going to be the best use of your time.\u2019\u201d It already appears to be working for some. Ben Greenwood had never had a trial with a professional club until he downloaded the app in 2019. After uploading footage of himself, the 17-year-old landed a trial with Chelsea, becoming the first user of the app to get a trial with a pro club. He signed a contract\u00a0with EPL team Bournemouth\u00a0in 2021. \u2018It\u2019s more about evolution\u2019 Having beta-tested in with players spanning 125 countries, Greenwood among them, 135 players have been trialed or signed by pro clubs or national teams through the app \u2014 which fully launched in September 2023 \u2014 according to Felton-Thomas. Just over 100,000 players make up the current database, but with over 100 clubs lined up to join Chelsea and Burnley, as well as a multi-year partnership with Major League Soccer in the US announced last May, Felton-Thomas projects user numbers to surge into the millions as the operation ramps up this year. Felton-Thomas said the \u201clion\u2019s share\u201d of its income comes from charging clubs a license fee to run the platform. Annual fees vary depending on the size of the club and the tools they require, ranging from six figures for \u201ctier one\u201d sides like Chelsea, to thousands of pounds for clubs lower down the footballing pyramid. The use of smart technology in sport continues to expand, including\u00a0AI commentary tools and wearable tech for elite athletes. The global market for sports analytics, valued at\u00a0$2.7 billion\u00a0in 2023, is projected to grow 22% by the end of the decade, according to market research firm Grand View Research. Should soccer talent scouts be concerned about being edged out by the arrival of AI in their industry? For Felton-Thomas, new technologies can co-exist with traditional methods. \u201cIt\u2019s more about evolution than revolution,\u201d Felton-Thomas explained. \u201cWe can\u2019t tell you when that player\u2019s actually in that match, how does he deal with adversity? What happens when he\u2019s 2-0 down? What happens when someone\u2019s shouting at him? What happens when he\u2019s just made a massive mistake?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got the ability to just augment real people to do their jobs better and faster, which then gives an opportunity to the player through the AI, but you\u2019re still actually just connecting them to the human on the other side, which is the club and the scout.\u201d While football remains ai.io\u2019s primary focus, the company is looking into opportunities in other sports to launch in the coming years. Further ahead, it may branch out beyond sports. \u201cYou think about the notion that you can be at home and analyze your movements, and how this could spin into health care, physical assessments for military disciplines and emergency services,\u201d Felton-Thomas told CNN.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/01/tech/aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "business"}}

Red Lobster was a restaurant industry pioneer, but has declined in recent years due to a range of factors, including corporate mismanagement, say former leaders at the chain and restaurant analysts. In 2020, Thai Union, a longtime supplier to Red Lobster, took an undisclosed financial stake in the chain, becoming a key shareholder. Since then, Red Lobster has cycled through four CEOs and an all-you-can-eat shrimp deal last year that slowed down table service and cut into Thai Union\u2019s profitability. Thai Union said earlier this year it would divest from Red Lobster and take a $530 million loss on its investment.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/business/red-lobster-is-abruptly-closing-dozens-of-restaurants/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_08_business_fdic-resign-banking-regulation", "text": "Martin Gruenberg, the chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, is facing a barrage of calls from lawmakers to resign after a scathing 234-page report released Tuesday detailed pervasive sexual harassment, discrimination and bullying at the agency. If he heeds the calls, there could be significant ramifications for banks across the country. The report, undertaken by the law firm Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton and commissioned by the FDIC, confirmed the findings of a November Wall Street Journal investigation revealing a long-standing problematic culture. It did not find that Gruenberg alone was responsible for the issues described in depth in the report based on interviews with over 500 employees. \u201cWe do recognize that, as a number of FDIC employees put it in talking about Chairman Gruenberg, culture \u2018starts at the top,\u2019\u201d the report said. It also documented several instances where he lashed out at subordinates \u201cparticularly when being delivered bad news or conveyed views with which he disagrees.\u201d That\u2019s caused staffers to delay delivering news they fear would upset him. Gruenberg\u2019s temperament \u201cmay hinder his ability to establish trust and confidence in leading meaningful culture change,\u201d the report added. Gruenberg did not respond to a request for a comment. An FDIC spokesperson told CNN Gruenberg \u201cis already implementing the recommendations in the report\u201d and that \u201cat his direction\u201d the agency is \u201cworking to identify and appoint a transformation monitor as well as an independent third-party expert to support these efforts.\u201d The majority of lawmakers calling on Gruenberg, a Democrat who was appointed by President Joe Biden, are Republicans. Aside from Democratic Rep. Bill Foster, Democrats have stopped short of calling on Gruenberg to resign. That\u2019s likely because if Gruenberg were to resign, Vice Chair Travis Hill, a Republican appointee, would automatically become chair until a replacement is appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. In the interim, that would leave the agency deadlocked with one other Republican and two Democratic members on the FDIC\u2019s board of directors. Rulemaking would come to a \u201cscreeching halt,\u201d Dennis Kelleher, president and CEO of Better Markets, a group that advocates for oversight of the financial sector, told CNN. With Hill at the FDIC\u2019s helm, there would also likely be little appetite to work with the Federal Reserve and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to pass any kind of regulations that beefs up bank capital requirements, he said. Last year, the three agencies approved a preliminary step to finalizing the rules known as Basel III Endgame \u2014 which would require the nation\u2019s largest banks to set aside more capital, limiting the amount of funds they have to lend to customers. The agencies are in the process of evaluating the initial proposal, which Hill voted against, and may propose new rules based on the comments they received. That\u2019s why Jaret Seiberg, a policy analyst at TD Cowen, said in a Tuesday note, \u201cGruenberg\u2019s departure would be a positive for the bigger banks.\u201d Seiberg doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s likely Gruenberg will resign, however, especially since progressive Democrats like Sen. Elizabeth Warren aren\u2019t calling for his resignation. Similarly, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre didn\u2019t convey that Biden has any reservations about Gruenberg\u2019s abilities to lead the FDIC. Kelleher also expressed concerns that Hill would not react fast enough if there was a banking crisis like last year\u2019s, which the FDIC played a key role in mitigating. Even though Hill did not lead the agency at the time, he was second-in-command, and there\u2019s no evidence he would prolong or exacerbate a banking failure. Hill, through an adviser, declined to comment.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/08/business/fdic-resign-banking-regulation/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_12_success_equal-pay-day-2024", "text": "March 12 marks Equal Pay Day in the United States, a symbolic date representing the number of days women have to work into the current year just to make the same amount of money men made in the prior one. Put another way, to make 12 months\u2019 worth of a man\u2019s median wages, a woman has to work about 14.5 months. In dollars and cents, for every dollar a man earns, a woman is paid 84 cents, according to the National Committee on Pay Equity and the Equal Pay Today campaign. That\u2019s based on earnings data for full-time, year-round workers from the US Census in 2022, which was the most recent full-year data set available. If part-time workers and those not employed year-round are included, the gender pay gap is worse, at 78 cents on the dollar, said Deborah Vagins, national campaign director of Equal Rights Advocates and director of Equal Pay Today. The size of the actual wage gap between men and women will widen or narrow depending on age, level of education, choice of occupation and tenure, as well as race and ethnicity. The gender pay gap is typically widest when comparing the earnings of White men to Black, Hispanic or Native American women. And, generally speaking, the gap is narrower in a given job when men and women are in their early- to mid-20s (i.e., when they are new to the workforce and before children come along), and also when comparing wages by title, tenure and education level within a given field. But no matter how you slice and dice the data, there are very few scenarios in which women on average earn the same as men. Indeed, in its latest analysis of median weekly earnings last year by occupation, the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research found that women earned less than men not only in all 20 of the largest occupations for men but also in all 20 of the largest occupations for women. Among the largest occupations for women, the most egregious pay gaps were among financial managers (women earned 71% of every dollar a man earns), retail salesperson (72%), education and child care administrators (79%), administrative assistants (80%) and managers (81%). The narrowest gap was among cashiers, where women almost have pay parity (98%) with their male colleagues. Same old (and annoying) story every year While the overall gender pay gap has been narrowing over time \u2014 for example, Equal Pay Day in 2005 was April 19, a full five weeks later than this year\u2019s \u2014 the very fact that \ufeffsuch a gap exists at all in 2024 is a reminder that employers and society still have work to do in recognizing the value of women\u2019s contributions at work. \u201cThe gender wage gap is a national disgrace,\u201d said\u00a0Jamila Taylor, IWPR\u2019s president and CEO, in a statement. \u201cEven in professions typically dominated by women, men earn more for doing the same job. Equal pay for equal work has been the law of the land for more than a half-century, yet\u00a0women still cannot get fair treatment when it comes to employment and earnings. And it\u2019s worse for women of color, who face rampant racial discrimination in the workforce in addition to ongoing pay inequities.\u201d The good news is that there are now multiple efforts that may over time help reduce the problem. They include an increasing number of state-level pay transparency laws and bans on employers asking job candidates for their salary histories, which can help chronically underpaid women gain more of an equal footing when they apply for new jobs. There is also now a ban on federal government agencies asking job candidates\u2019 for their salary history and a proposed rule that would prohibit federal contractors from doing the same, as well as requiring them to post in their job ads the pay for given positions. But Vagins and others in the campaign for equal pay also want to see action at the federal legislative level, supporting two bills: the Salary Transparency Act and the Paycheck Fairness Act, which have been introduced in the US House and Senate multiple times. For instance, the Paycheck Fairness Act would, according to Equal Pay Today, \u201cbar retaliation against workers who voluntarily discuss or disclose their wages; close loopholes that have allowed employers to pay women less than men for the same work \u2026 [and] ensure women can receive the same robust remedies for sex-based pay discrimination that are currently available to those subjected to discrimination based on race and ethnicity.\u201d Absent such federal laws requiring all employers to make equal pay more of an imperative, Vagins said, achieving true pay parity for women will be slow in coming.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/12/success/equal-pay-day-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2022_04_27_business_diamonds-manmade-demand", "text": "It\u2019s proposal season, and engagements are on the rise. So are factory-made diamond sales. Not that you\u2019d know the difference. Man-made diamonds look the same as naturally occurring ones. The only noticeable difference is the price tag. \u201cThe result is really stunning,\u201d said Edahn Golan, an independent diamond industry analyst. He said March data showed the number of engagement rings sold that featured a manufactured diamond jumped 63% compared to last year, while the number of engagement rings sold with a natural diamond declined 25% in the same period. Going back by another month, to February, the data showed the number of rings sold with lab diamonds that month surged even more, to 80% compared to a year earlier while the number fell by 13% for natural diamond engagement rings.  \u201cThe big fear in the natural diamonds industry is that consumers will start accepting lab-grown diamonds in engagement rings,\u201d he said. Too late. \u201cIt\u2019s actually happening.\u201d  Tide is shifting Why are consumers flocking to man-made diamonds? Cost is the most obvious reason. The average retail price of the most popular one carat round man-made diamond for an engagement ring in March was $2,318, Golan said. \u201cThis is substantially less \u2013 as much as 73% cheaper \u2013 than a natural diamond of the same size, cut and clarity as the man-made diamond, which would cost $8,740,\u201d he said. Plus, the lower cost allows couples to buy a bigger stone.  \u201cA lab diamond is a real diamond, but maybe it took a few weeks to make it,\u201d said Golan. \u201cNatural diamonds were formed over 800 million to three billion years and there isn\u2019t an infinite supply of them.\u201d  This makes natural diamonds quite a bit more expensive, and prices are likely to rise as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has tightened the supply chain for natural raw diamonds. The sanctions directly target Alrosa, partly owned by the Russian government, which the US government identified as the world\u2019s largest diamond mining company, accounting for 28% of global diamond output. Man-made diamonds are also becoming popular as consumers are more aware and educated about them, said Dan Moran, a third-generation diamond expert and owner of LA-based fine jeweler Concierge Diamonds. Moran said the typical buyer of man-made diamonds is typically younger than 40 and very budget conscious. Mined diamonds have a controversial history that\u2019s tied to the use of child labor in some African diamond mines as well as sales of illegally-traded \u201cconflict diamonds\u201d that fund conflict in war-torn areas. Among Millennials and Gen Z, their eco-conscious mindset and ethical concerns about natural diamond sourcing is another factor influencing their preference for non-traditional engagement rings, according to a report from wedding planning website The Knot. Small but growing share of the diamond market Although its slice is growing, the market share for man-made diamonds remains relatively small. Currently, about 7% of the specialty diamond jewelry market is represented by man-made diamonds, up from 3% in 2020, said Golan.  Some major jewelry retailers are driving the effort to take man-made diamonds mainstream. In 2021, the world\u2019s largest jewelry company, Pandora\n            \n                (PANDY), made a major shift by announcing it would stop using mined diamonds and would swap to lab-created diamonds in its jewelry.  Pandora said it\u2019s instituting the change as part of an effort to sell sustainable jewelry, and also because consumers increasingly are asking for it. Signet,\n            \n                (SIG) the largest jewelry company in the United States (which owns Zales, Kay Jewelers and Jared chains) called out the popularity of lab diamond jewelry in its March earnings call with analysts. Calling it a \u201cfast-growing category\u201d in its jewelry portfolio, Signet CEO Virginia Drosos told analysts that lab-created diamonds are among the big jewelry trends she expects this year.  The company said it has expanded its man-made bridal jewelry selection in both its Zales and Kay Jewelers stores in response to the increased demand.  Fine jewelry brand Charles and Colvard, which makes lab-created diamonds, said consumers don\u2019t just want to look good with the jewelry they are wearing, they also want to feel good about it. \u201cAs the momentum for conscious consumerism grows, the surge towards lab grown diamonds isn\u2019t surprising,\u201d said Don O\u2019Connell, president and CEO of Charles & Colvard. \u201c[Consumers] want to know the origins of their stones and be reassured they\u2019re conflict-free. They\u2019re embracing the choice to purchase a piece of fine jewelry that aligns with their values.\u201d Lab-grown diamond brand VRAI said the pandemic, too, has sparked attention and action toward social and environmental issues. It said consumers are being more thoughtful and reassessing their purchasing habits, as well as the companies and industries they are supporting. There is, however, one important consideration for anyone buying lab-created diamonds: Man-made diamonds have little resale value.  So while you may not be able to tell a natural diamond from a factory made variety, someone with a trained eye can, said Golan. Once a stone is identified as a factory diamond, even though you paid a lot less for it, you also won\u2019t get much for it.  But the value of a ring isn\u2019t just monetary. \u201cAs a professional in the industry, I am asked all the time by people about what I think about a ring they have,\u201d said Moran, of Concierge Jewelers. \u201cI always say, if you love it, be happy with it. An engagement ring is a symbol of commitment and enduring love.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/27/business/diamonds-manmade-demand/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "business"}}
