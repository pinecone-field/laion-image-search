The probe is yet another complication for the social media platform, which is already facing the threat of a potential US ban or a forced divestment from its Chinese parent company. The sources said that the FTC is probing TikTok over an alleged violation of the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection rule, which requires companies to notify parents and obtain consent before collecting data from children under 13. The agency is also investigating whether TikTok violated a portion of the FTC Act that prohibits \u201cunfair or deceptive\u201d business practices, the sources said, in denying that TikTok user data could be accessed by individuals in China. The FTC could bring a suit against TikTok or settle with the company in the coming weeks, according to one of the sources. Politico reported news of the probe earlier. When asked about the investigation, FTC Director of Public Affairs Douglas Farrar replied: \u201cNo comment.\u201d TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The FTC probe comes as TikTok faces an existential threat in the US. Earlier this month, a bipartisan group in the US House of Representatives voted to pass a law forcing TikTok to be sold by ByteDance or face a ban from US app stores. The bill is now before the Senate, and President Joe Biden has said he would sign it if it gets to his desk. Senate leaders, however, have indicated they are taking a deliberate approach \u2014\u00a0which could lead to delays or even potentially doom the House bill. The short-form video company, owned by Chinese firm ByteDance, has denied assertions that its app poses a national security threat to US citizens. TikTok, which does not operate in China, has said that the Chinese government has never accessed US user data. Cybersecurity experts say Chinese laws require ByteDance to cooperate with that country\u2019s intelligence demands\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a fact that, given ByteDance\u2019s ownership of TikTok, could hypothetically put US user data at risk. To address that issue, TikTok has taken steps to store its US user data on cloud servers controlled by US tech giant Oracle and established internal protocols limiting access by non-US employees. TikTok acknowledged to Congress in 2022 that employees based in China could access US user data, following a report that year by BuzzFeed News that ByteDance employees had accessed that information on multiple occasions. TikTok CEO Shou Chew, in his first appearance before Congress last year, also acknowledged that several ByteDance employees were fired for spying on certain US journalists as part of a \u201cmisguided attempt\u201d to hunt down leakers within the company.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/ftc-tiktok-probe-privacy-and-security/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_media_newsmax-smartmatic-defamation-case", "text": "The right-wing cable channel Newsmax denied Friday that it intentionally destroyed or concealed internal emails in an ongoing defamation case filed by voting technology company Smartmatic over\u00a0the network\u2019s airing of false\u00a0claims about the 2020 election. Lawyers for Smartmatic previously claimed Newsmax \u201cconcealed over 200,000 documents\u201d and \u201cmade multiple material misrepresentations to the court,\u201d by falsely asserting\u00a0it\u00a0had turned over everything before the discovery process wrapped up. But the network said in filings Friday that it never meant to hide anything, and that the vast majority of the supposedly new materials were duplicates of old files. Newsmax said the allegations are\u00a0\u201cimplausible inferences\u201d and \u201cnothing more than speculation.\u201d In the wake of the 2020 election, Newsmax and other right-wing media outlets gave\u00a0airtime\u00a0to the\u00a0false\u00a0assertion that electronic voting machines had switched votes from then-President Donald Trump to Joe Biden, costing Trump the election. No evidence has ever been found to support the claim. In the months that followed, Smartmatic filed a defamation lawsuit against Newsmax and other right-wing outlets and figures, including Fox News, Rudy Giuliani and conspiracy theorist Mike Lindell.\u00a0Smartmatic and Newsmax have\u00a0since\u00a0been embroiled in the\u00a0years-long defamation case,\u00a0which\u00a0is slated to go to trial this September in Delaware Superior Court, barring an out-of-court settlement. In court filings, Smartmatic claimed some of the 200,000 documents include texts among Newsmax executives discussing the \u201cdecision not to call the (2020) election.\u201d Parts of the court papers are redacted, but the context suggests that Newsmax also turned over new emails where top executives disparaged their own shows and reporters. Smartmatic further accused Newsmax of intentionally \u201cdestroying relevant evidence\u201d by deleting texts and emails from senior officials. They claimed this \u201ccover-up\u201d was \u201ccarefully calculated\u201d to block Smartmatic from ever seeing the material. They claimed Newsmax CEO Chris Ruddy let his texts from 2020 get deleted, despite knowing they needed to be saved. \u201cRepeatedly, Newsmax has kept documents showing its actual malice and bad motive out of Smartmatic\u2019s hands,\u201d Smartmatic wrote in a court filing that was made public last week. \u201cThese were not isolated mistakes. This was by design. Newsmax has intentionally destroyed and concealed crucial evidence that is damaging to its case.\u201d But in its response Friday, Newsmax said the entire dispute over the newly found files is simply \u201can attempt (by Smartmatic) to manufacture an issue where none exists.\u201d \u201cMany of the documents Smartmatic claims were \u2018newly produced\u2019 and bear on \u2018key issues\u2019 were already in Smartmatic\u2019s possession in duplicate or near duplicate versions having been produced by Newsmax,\u201d the network said in filings made public Friday. Lawyers for the network said it transitioned legal teams in January and\u00a0reviewed\u00a0its previous document productions. They said they realized that some documents hadn\u2019t been turned over, but this was fixed \u201cas soon as Newsmax discovered this.\u201d Barring a settlement between the two parties,\u00a0the September trial\u00a0over false claims of vote rigging in the 2020 election\u00a0is set\u00a0to coincide with the 2024 election season,\u00a0as leading\u00a0Republicans continue to express doubt over whether Biden legitimately won the\u00a0previous\u00a0election. Fox News famously paid more than $787 million to Dominion Voting Systems to settle a case last year\u00a0over similar 2020 election lies on its airwaves. Newsmax, which is owned by Ruddy,\u00a0isn\u2019t a\u00a0right-wing\u00a0media juggernaut\u00a0like Fox, but\u00a0remains\u00a0influential in the pro-Trump media ecosystem, even with its smaller audience. The network\u2019s lineup features\u00a0former\u00a0Fox personalities like\u00a0Eric Bolling\u00a0and Greta Van Susteren, controversial Trump White House official\u00a0Sebastian Gorka\u00a0and Clinton ally-turned-foe Dick Morris. A trial could put Newsmax\u2019s financial future in peril, but there is one major difference between the Newsmax and Fox cases.\u00a0In the weeks following the election, Smartmatic threatened to sue Newsmax in 2020,\u00a0the network\u00a0ran an on-air segment\u00a0and\u00a0published an article saying there was \u201cno evidence\u201d that Smartmatic or Dominion ever \u201cmanipulated votes in the 2020 election.\u201d Newsmax also faces a\u00a0separate\u00a0defamation suit from Dominion.

{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl", "text": "Sam Altman has agreed to return to lead OpenAI, the company said in a Tuesday post on X, just days after his surprise ouster as chief executive sparked an employee revolt that threatened to undermine what has been the leading company in the fledgling artificial intelligence industry. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman wrote that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft, which is the ChatGPT maker\u2019s biggest financial backer. The announcement appears to bring to an end days of chaos for the AI industry that included negotiations over who should lead OpenAI and how the firm should be run, as well as broader discussions about just how fast the arms race to develop AI technology should be moving. The details of Altman\u2019s firing and re-hiring remain murky. In its announcement Friday, OpenAI claimed that Altman had been insufficiently \u201ccandid\u201d with the board. That ambiguous language sent the rumor mill flying. But a key factor in Altman\u2019s ouster was the presence of\u00a0tensions between Altman, who favored pushing AI development more aggressively, and members of the original OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the crisis. As of Monday morning, Nadella had announced that Altman, along with fellow OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, would be joining Microsoft to lead a new AI research division. OpenAI said it had hired former Twitch chief Emmett Shear as interim CEO. But then hundreds of OpenAI employees, nearly the company\u2019s entire staff, threatened to leave, potentially for Microsoft, if the company\u2019s board didn\u2019t resign and reinstate Altman as CEO. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it invested billions in to help bolster its ambitions in developing AI, which many in Silicon Valley think will be the most important wave of technological advancement in the coming decades. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Microsoft CEO\u00a0Satya Nadella said on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d Altman\u2019s vision to quickly roll out and commercialize AI tools also appears to have won out. Publicly, Altman has long cautioned about risks posed by AI, and he\u202fhas pledged to lawmakers and customers that he would move OpenAI forward responsibly. \u201cIs [AI] gonna be like the printing press that diffused knowledge, power and learning widely across the landscape that empowered ordinary, everyday individuals that led to greater flourishing, that led above all to greater liberty?\u201d he said in a May Senate subcommittee hearing pressing for regulation. \u201cOr is it gonna be more like the atom bomb \u2014 huge technological breakthrough, but the consequences (severe, terrible) continue to haunt us to this day?\u201d But inside the company, Altman had been pushing to bring products to market more quickly and to sell them for a profit. Altman announced a few weeks ago at OpenAI\u2019s first-ever developer day that the company would make tools available so anyone could create their own version of ChatGPT. OpenAI has also worked with Microsoft to roll out ChatGPT-like technology across Microsoft\u2019s products. OpenAI and iPhone designer Jony Ive had also reportedly\u202fbeen in talks to raise $1 billion from Japanese conglomerate SoftBank for an AI device to replace the smartphone. \u2014 CNN\u2019s Juliana Liu and Diksha Madhok contributed reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "business"}}

The suits, which accuse the companies of \u201cgrooming\u201d the Robb Elementary School shooter,\u00a0come after 19 families of students and teachers killed\u00a0at the school announced on Wednesday that\u00a0they settled a lawsuit with the city for $2 million. The companies \u2013 Meta, Activision\u00a0and Daniel Defense \u2013 all contributed to the behavior of\u00a0the\u00a0shooter\u00a0Salvador Ramos\u00a0in one way or another, the suits allege. Ramos\u00a0downloaded\u00a0the video game\u00a0\u201cCall of Duty: Modern Warfare\u201d in November 2021, according to the complaint filed in California against the publisher of the game, Activision, Meta, and others. The game featured a weapon from Daniel Defense called the DDM4 V7, which served as \u201ca teaser for players eager to try out the weapon,\u201d the suit alleges. At the same time, Ramos\u00a0\u201cwas being courted through explicit, aggressive marketing,\u201d on Instagram, the suit said. Meta\u00a0is the parent company of Instagram. \u201cIn addition to hundreds of images depicting and glorifying the thrill of combat, Daniel Defense used Instagram to extol the illegal, murderous use of its weapons,\u201d the suit said. \u201cWithin weeks of downloading Modern Warfare, the Shooter was browsing assault weapons, acquiring firearm attachments popularized by the game, and returning repeatedly to Daniel Defense\u2019s website.\u201d \u201cMere minutes after midnight on May 16\u2014the Shooter\u2019s 18th birthday\u2014he purchased a DDM4V7,\u201d the suit said. \u201cEight days later, the Shooter inflicted unspeakable violence at Robb Elementary School, killing 21 and injuring and traumatizing many more.\u201d Investigators in the Uvalde shooting found\u00a0one of Ramos\u2019 AR15-style rifles, manufactured by Daniel Defense, in the school,\u00a0according to then-Texas state Sen. John Whitmire, who is now the mayor of Houston. \u201cThe Defendants bear responsibility for this profound corruption of our children,\u201d the suit filed in California Superior Court in Los Angeles says. \u201cIn concert with certain firearm manufacturers, they have groomed a generation of young men who are socially vulnerable, insecure about their masculinity, and eager to show strength and assert dominance.\u201d According to the suit filed in Uvalde, Texas District Court, Daniel Defense\u00a0courts adolescents by harnessing and exploiting \u201cthe power of social media and first-person shooter simulations to lure teenagers to its website where it can monitor their online activity, build a profile of their interests, and solicit their contact information.\u201d In a statement,\u00a0Josh\u00a0Koskoff,\u00a0a\u00a0partner at\u00a0Koskoff,\u00a0Koskoff\u00a0& Bieder and\u00a0an\u00a0attorney for the families said:\u00a0\u201cThere is a direct line between the conduct of these companies and the Uvalde shooting.\u00a0Just 23 minutes after midnight on his 18th birthday, the Uvalde shooter bought an AR-15 made by a company with a market share of less than one percent. Why? Because, well before he was old enough to purchase it, he was targeted and cultivated online by Instagram, Activision and Daniel Defense. This three-headed monster knowingly exposed him to the weapon, conditioned him to see it as a tool to solve his problems and trained him to use it.\u201d A company spokesperson for Activision said in a statement to CNN Friday: \u201cThe Uvalde shooting was horrendous and heartbreaking in every way, and we express our deepest sympathies to the families and communities who remain impacted by this senseless act of violence.

{"id": "2024_03_26_media_nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash", "text": "Cesar Conde has a decision to make \u2014 and it\u2019s not an especially difficult one. The NBCUniversal News Group chair is facing a torrent of backlash from his own staff after greenlighting the hire of former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel as a paid network contributor. Over the last 24 hours, the most prominent and recognizable NBC News and MSNBC personalities have voiced strong displeasure with the company\u2019s decision to welcome McDaniel to \u201cthe team.\u201d And they\u2019re not doing it via anonymous comments to the press. They\u2019re doing it on the record on NBCU\u2019s own air. Chuck Todd broke the dam on Sunday\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with a set of candid comments about the hiring, and Rachel Maddow capped the flood of backlash Monday night with a blistering 30-minute monologue eviscerating the network\u2019s leadership for the \u201cinexplicable\u201d move. Suffice to say, NBCU News Group is in unprecedented territory. Never has a network\u2019s C-suite ever been so thoroughly flogged by its most high-profile stars in such no holds barred fashion. Saying that Conde simply has a crisis on his hands would be a contender for understatement of the year. It\u2019s a five-alarm fire at NBCU News Group, and one of Conde\u2019s own making. While NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown were most directly responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring, a decision that MSNBC boss Rashida Jones did not object to it at the time, the buck ultimately stops with Conde, who hold the real power at the Peacock Network. McDaniel\u2019s hiring could not have happened without Conde\u2019s blessing. It does not take a brilliant political mind with prescient foresight to understand that hiring McDaniel would ignite a firestorm of outrage \u2014 from both within 30 Rock and outside it. Conde, someone who ostensibly supports American democracy, should have rejected McDaniel\u2019s hiring on the grounds that NBCU News Group could not put someone on its payroll who tried to subvert the 2020 vote. As so many of NBCU\u2019s staffers have underscored, the objection to McDaniel is not that she is a Republican. It\u2019s not even that she is a Donald Trump-supporting Republican. It\u2019s that she was an active participant in the plot to overthrow the last presidential election. That is not to even mention McDaniel\u2019s years of demonizing the press, smearing the journalists who work at NBC News and MSNBC as she sought to destroy the credibility of the organization that she ran to after being chased out of the RNC. The notion put forward by NBC that it needed to hire McDaniel to bring its viewers \u201can insider\u2019s perspective on national politics and the future of the Republican Party\u201d is absurd. If that\u2019s the case, the network should move to hire free agents like Tucker Carlson or Candace Owens. They too have their hands on the pulse of the Republican Party. In fact, they represent much more of where the GOP stands today than McDaniel. So, using NBC\u2019s logic, why not hire them? (Spoiler: News organizations rightfully have established basic standards for paid contributors. Asking that your employees have a commitment to democracy, to the truth, and to basic decency is not a big ask.) But even if Conde has no allegiance to basic democratic principles, which this hire calls into question, given that he is known to be a political player who cares deeply about his own image in the press, he should have been wise enough to foresee that hiring McDaniel would be an ill-conceived move. How this did not occur to Conde is unfathomable and shows a tremendous lack of judgment. Even more bizarre is Conde\u2019s management, or lack thereof, since the controversy erupted. It was clear early on that his employees at NBC News and MSNBC did not support McDaniel\u2019s hiring. If that was not evident on Friday, it was clear as day on Sunday after \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d The network\u2019s employees were not only flabbergasted and demoralized by the move, but absolutely enraged by it. At that point, the writing should have been on the wall for Conde \u2014 as it was for every other media executive that I have spoken with over the last 24 hours. It is evident that McDaniel has no real future as an NBC analyst and the decision to bring her on as a contributor will have to be reversed. After all, which NBC or MSNBC program is going to invite her on after all of this? The only real question for Conde after the Sunday morning scolding should have been how he chose to back out of the deal in the least painful way possible. To be fully honest, I very much expected a Sunday evening announcement from NBC, one that would have earned praise from the company\u2019s staff and quickly been swept away by the rush of Trump news Monday morning. But no such announcement came. Instead, Conde has allowed the mess to spiral absolutely out of control. MSNBC\u2019s top stars hammered the network\u2019s leadership throughout the day Monday over the hire. NBC News\u2019 Guild blasted Conde, saying in a statement that under him the company had quietly laid off employees over the last month and instead chosen to \u201cprioritize an election denier over its reporters.\u201d The already severe crisis was allowed to blossom into one of the worst corporate public relations catastrophes in recent memory. All the while, Conde has remained silent. I asked his spokesperson, Stephen Labaton, on Monday whether the NBCU News Group boss had any comment on the situation. Does he have any regret? I didn\u2019t get an on-the-record response. Suffice to say, however, that what Conde does moving forward will say a lot about his character and commitment to democratic values. It will also say a lot about the NBCU News Group and what type of organization it is. In her biting monologue on Monday night, however, Maddow did offer Conde a way out of this mess. \u201cMistakes will be made,\u201d Maddow said.\u201dBut our resilience as a democracy is going to be recognizing when decisions are bad ones and reversing those bad decisions. Hearing legitimate criticism, responding to it, and correcting course. Not digging in. Not blaming others. Take a minute. Acknowledge that maybe it wasn\u2019t the right call.\u201d \u201cIt is a sign of strength, not weakness, to acknowledge when you are wrong,\u201d Maddow added. \u201cIt is a sign of strength. And our country needs us to be strong now.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/media/nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_27_media_nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over", "text": "Only 80 hours elapsed between NBC News announcing Ronna McDaniel as a paid contributor and the network ousting her from that very role. But for the leadership at NBC Universal News Group, those were 80\u00a0painful hours. On Tuesday evening, following another full day in which the media rumor mill churned at warp speed, NBCU News Group boss Cesar Conde sent staff a memo, notifying his troops that he had reversed his decision to welcome the former Republican National Committee chair to \u201cthe team.\u201d \u201cAfter listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor,\u201d Conde said, adding that he wanted to \u201cpersonally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down.\u201d Conde had no real choice. The embattled NBCU boss, who I\u2019m told dealt with the crisis from an unknown location outside of 30 Rock, was facing an unprecedented rebellion from his most high-profile stars, who one by one went on the air and excoriated leadership\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel. The only aspect of Conde\u2019s note that was surprising was the fact that it came 48 hours late, allowing what started off as a crisis to fester and balloon into one of the worst corporate public relations calamities in recent memory. \u201cWhat a sh*t show!\u201d a media executive exclaimed to me Tuesday shortly after Conde relieved McDaniel of her NBC News credentials. In his note, Conde said he took \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for McDaniel\u2019s hire. But, he also did point the finger, telling staffers that hiring her was \u201ca collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team.\u201d Indeed, multiple people familiar with the matter have told me that the infighting among NBC executives over who was at fault for the disaster has reached a fever pitch, with various factions of the NBCU News Group assigning blame to others. Regardless of who is to blame, the entire affair made clear who is actually in control of the company \u2014 and it\u2019s not Conde & Co. Despite the NBCU C-suite digging their heels in the sand as they resisted dumping McDaniel for days, they were ultimately forced to succumb to pressure from their talent. As a second media executive commented to me, it is now \u201cvery clear who is in charge\u201d after the \u201cweak leadership was put on full display.\u201d \u201cHas Cesar lost the room?\u201d wondered a third media executive. While the Peacock family argues over who was really at fault, the company is facing a fresh public relations mess. Led by Donald Trump, right-wing personalities are already assailing the network as being overrun with intolerant woke leftists. \u201cThese Radical Left Lunatics are CRAZY and the top people at NBC ARE WEAK,\u201d Trump raged on his Truth Social platform. Ari Fleischer, who served as press secretary under President George W. Bush, wrote on X: \u201cWhat NBC is saying is if you\u2019re for Trump, you don\u2019t belong. Good. Let NBC be for Democrats only.\u201d Of course, that narrative is intellectually dishonest. The objection to McDaniel from both within and outside of NBCU was not that she is a Republican. It wasn\u2019t even that she was a Trump-supporting Republican. No, the objection stemmed from the fact that McDaniel was an active participant in the plot to subvert the 2020 vote. And, in addition to that disgraceful history, she had a lengthy track record smearing NBC News and MSNBC. Nevertheless, NBCU will now have to contend with such dishonest attacks being leveled by the right, which will follow them in the days, months, and even years to come. As unfair as it may be, they will certainly damage the network\u2019s brand in Republican circles \u2014 a place it had gone through great pains to appeal to. NBCU will also have to grapple with McDaniel, who spent the last 24 hours or so interviewing lawyers as she gears up for a possible legal fight with the network, according to a person familiar with the matter. The rift between McDaniel and NBCU had grown to such an extent by Tuesday that she was not informed by network brass that she had been dismissed, I\u2019m told. Instead, McDaniel learned of her ouster in press reports. While NBCU is being beaten up on the right, the company\u2019s leadership was quickly praised by its journalists and top stars. Shortly after Conde sent out his memo, Rachel Maddow appeared on Joy Reid\u2019s show, where the two lauded Conde for reversing course. \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/27/media/nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "business"}}

Specifically, 485,000 of them. That\u2019s up 15% from the 422,000 accounts reported at the end of 2023 and 43% higher than a year ago. Fidelity is one of the largest providers of workplace retirement plans, and its 401(k) data is based on more than 23 million plan participants. The record number of million-dollar-plus accounts was first reported by Bloomberg. The average balance for the so-called 401(k) \u201cmillionaires\u201d came to $1,580,000, up from $1,551,300 in the fourth quarter, a Fidelity spokesperson said. There is no secret sauce for how a 401(k) participant can accumulate that kind of balance \u2014 or any kind of substantial balance for that matter. While market returns are key, even more essential is the amount one saves over time. The average 401(k) participant with a balance over $1 million, according to Fidelity, has been saving for 26 years and contributes 17% of their income, which includes any matches they receive from their employer. Other 401(k) participants also saw increases in their balances in the first quarter. \u201cRecord-high contribution levels coupled with positive market conditions pushed average account balances to their highest levels since the fourth quarter of 2021,\u201d Fidelity said. \u201cLong-term savers observed the greatest improvement, which is good news, especially for the more than 4.9 million workers that have been in their 401(k) plan for five years or more.\u201d The average balance rose to $125,900, up 16% from a year ago. The average savings rate hit a record 14.2%, including employer matches, and is very close to the recommended 15% savings rate from Fidelity and retirement savings experts. Among Gen Xers, who are next on deck to retire behind the Baby Boomers, those that have been saving continuously for 15 years had an average balance of $543,400, just a smidge higher than the $543,200 Baby Boomers in that category had saved over the same period. Meanwhile, the number of 401(k) participants who had borrowed against their savings and still had a loan outstanding in the first quarter held steady relative to the fourth quarter at 17.8%, but that is up from 16.7% a year earlier. Retirement readiness in the United States is an issue for a majority of workers, including the millions of employees who don\u2019t have access to a workplace savings plan or who don\u2019t participate if they do.

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) imposed a fine of nearly \u00a328 million ($36 million) on Citigroup (C), while the Bank of England\u2019s Prudential Regulation Authority fined it almost \u00a334 million ($43 million) following investigations into the US bank, according to statements from the authorities. The regulators reduced their fines by 30% because Citigroup agreed to settle the matter. Without that discount, the combined fine would have topped \u00a388 million ($112 million). \u201cWe are pleased to resolve this matter from more than two years ago, which arose from an individual error that was identified and corrected within minutes,\u201d a Citigroup spokesperson told CNN. \u201cWe immediately took steps to strengthen our systems and controls, and remain committed to ensuring full regulatory compliance.\u201d The spokesperson declined to comment on reports that the trade was the result of a fat-finger error, where incorrect data is inputted because the wrong key is pressed.  The Bank of England highlighted an incident in May 2022 when one of Citigroup\u2019s \u201cexperienced\u201d traders sold $1.4 billion worth of stocks on European exchanges in error, triggering what brokers described at the time as a \u201cflash crash.\u201d In its statement, the FCA said the unnamed trader had intended to sell stocks worth only $58 million, but made an \u201cinputting error,\u201d which resulted in an order to sell $444 billion. Citigroup\u2019s systems blocked $255 billion of that, meaning that $189 billion was sent to its trading platform for sale \u201cover the rest of the day.\u201d In total, $1.4 billion worth of stocks was sold before the trader canceled the transaction. \u201cThere was no\u00a0hard block\u00a0that would have\u00a0rejected\u00a0this\u00a0large\u00a0erroneous\u00a0basket of equities\u00a0in\u00a0its\u00a0entirety\u00a0and prevented\u00a0any of it\u00a0reaching the market,\u201d the FCA said, adding that the failings risked creating \u201ca disorderly market.\u201d The FCA also highlighted the ability of the trader to manually override a pop-up alert, without being required to read all the details it contained, and the bank\u2019s \u201cineffective\u201d real-time monitoring,\u00a0which\u00a0meant alerts were escalated too slowly. Following the incident, Citigroup has taken steps to \u201cimprove and strengthen\u201d the security of its trading systems, the central bank said. \u201cFirms involved in trading must have effective controls in place in order to manage the risks involved. (Citigroup) failed to meet the standards we expect in this area, resulting in today\u2019s fine,\u201d said Sam Woods, chief executive officer of the Prudential Regulation Authority. Another costly error for Citigroup It is not the first time Citigroup has blundered. In 2020, the bank accidentally wired $900 million in interest payments to the lenders of cosmetics company Revlon \u2014\u00a0more than 100 times the intended amount. Some lenders returned the money, but others did not. A US district court judge ruled in 2021 that the bank would not be allowed to recover the outstanding $500 million. Another trading mishap in 2014 \u2014\u00a0unconnected to Citigroup \u2014 rattled the Japanese stock market. An anonymous broker made and then swiftly canceled orders for more than $600 billion worth of stocks, the BBC reported at the time.

{"id": "2024_03_19_success_wall-street-bonuses", "text": "Last year wasn\u2019t the most lucrative for Wall Street bankers, but their bonus payouts still easily trounced US median household income. The average Wall Street bonus for 2023 was $176,500, according to estimates that will be released Tuesday morning by New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli. That\u2019s down 2% from the $180,000 recorded in 2022. Both those averages were well below the $240,000 paid out in 2021. That the average bonus was slightly down isn\u2019t surprising. Wall Street earnings last year were mixed, and merger and acquisition activity was underwhelming. \u201cWall Street\u2019s profits were up 1.8% in 2023, but firms have taken a more cautious approach to compensation and more employees have joined the securities industry, which accounts for the slight decline in the average bonus,\u201d DiNapoli said in a statement. Nevertheless, a little perspective: The average Wall Street bonus, which comes on top of the nearly half-a-million-dollar average Wall Street salary, was itself almost 2.5 times higher than the median US household income of $74,580, according to Census data for 2022. Wall Street bonuses and general employment in the securities industry provide vital revenue streams for the New York State and New York City economies, accounting most recently for 27% of the state\u2019s tax collections and 7% of city tax revenue, according to DiNapoli\u2019s office. The securities industry \ufeffin the city employed roughly 198,500 people last year, up from 191,600 the year before. And DiNapoli estimates that 1 in 11 of the city\u2019s jobs are either directly or indirectly associated with the industry. The total estimated bonus pool for 2023 was\u00a0slightly lower than the year before and is\u00a0projected to bring in $4 million less in state income tax revenue and $2 million less for the city revenue than bonuses in 2022 did. Still, DiNapoli noted, \u201cWhile these bonuses affect income tax revenues for the state and city, both budgeted for larger declines so the impact on projected revenues should be limited.\u201d It should be noted that the comptroller\u2019s numbers only reflect the bonuses paid to securities industry employees working for firms based in New York City. Beyond bringing in tax revenue for government coffers, Wall Street workers contribute substantially to the local Gotham economy. DiNapoli said that more employees in financial services (65%) are working in-office on any given day compared to 58% working in other industries in the city, at least as of September 2023. And that securities industry employees use the subway more than other workers in the city. All in, he estimates that Wall Street is responsible for roughly 14% of economic activity in the city. As critical as that is, the city and state are about much more than just Wall Street. \u201cThe securities industry\u2019s continued strength should not overshadow the broader economic picture in New York, where we need all sectors to enjoy full recovery from the pandemic,\u201d DiNapoli said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/19/success/wall-street-bonuses/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit", "text": "When Apple launched its first Mac computer in 1984, with its iconic Mac smiley-face \u201chello\u201d greeting, it wanted to differentiate itself in the fledgling PC market. The Mac was approachable with its friendly, innovative design \u2013 Apple\u2019s way of setting the Mac apart in the confusing PC landscape. That consumer-friendly mantra still exists today, with Apple carefully curating an easy-breezy yet controlled user experience across its products, including the billions of iPhones used around the world. But the Biden administration believes Apple took that too far. On Thursday, the Department of Justice sued Apple for illegally monopolizing the smartphone market. In a press conference, the government provided a long list of how Apple has allegedly squashed competition with restrictive app store terms, high fees and its \u201cwalled-garden\u201d approach, restricting how third-party companies interact with its brands and services. The company denied the lawsuit\u2019s allegations and said it plans to fight them. Apple added that the lawsuit could empower the government \u201cto take a heavy hand in designing people\u2019s technology.\u201d But if successful, the lawsuit could ripple across Apple\u2019s products and services. Although the suit could take years to play out, here\u2019s a closer look what it may eventually mean for iPhone users: Changes to the App Store If found liable, the company could be forced to change a number of things. One such change is how iPhone users could get greater access to \u201csuper apps\u201d that have been largely restricted before. The term refers to one-stop-shop apps that allow for messaging, ordering food, payment processing and other capabilities all within one platform.  According to Dipanjan Chatterjee, a principal analyst at market research firm Forrester, super apps most threaten Apple\u2019s preeminence in the lives of its customers. \u201cAn offering like WeChat, dubbed China\u2019s everything app, can provide an alternative to the Apple ecosystem for people to communicate, bank, share memories, talk to businesses and more,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cWhat Apple fears most is becoming irrelevant to its customers.\u201d At the same time, super apps like WeChat are created by larger companies and could, therefore, put some smaller companies at a disadvantage. And the concept hasn\u2019t been welcomed much in the US anyway. The US government, however, could argue that lack of interest may be due to Apple\u2019s high share of the smartphone market and its resistance to offer super apps in its store, Chatterjee said. Better interoperability Apple may also be required to offer more support for cross-platform messaging, an issue the company previously said it\u2019s already working on. The company lets iPhone users send high-quality photos and videos to one another, but similar texts to Android phones are slower and grainy. It also maintains those messages in green bubbles, creating a kind of class divide, critics argue. In November, the company said it will add new features, such as read receipts, typing indicators, better support for group chats and higher quality media sharing of images and videos, across platforms to help close the gap. Apple\u2019s move to add support for the standard called RCS (rich communication services) is intended to roll out later this year. RCS is considered the replacement to alternatives such as SMS, or short messaging service, and can work over both Wi-Fi and mobile data. The change followed pressure from both regulators and competitors to more seamlessly work across operating systems. The European Union\u2019s Digital Markets Act, for example, requires companies to make their key services interoperable between platforms. The US government could require the same. More open services Another likely change is how hardware from other companies, such as smartwatches, will interact with the Apple range of devices and software, including the iPhone and Apple\u2019s services like Fitness+. The company has also required Apple Watch users to own iOS devices as a way to keep them locked into its existing ecosystem. Chatterjee said making this change would have both positives and negatives. \u201cThe net result would reside somewhere along the spectrum of access to more and cheaper options but also the devaluation of the customer experience that is so highly prized by Apple\u2019s customers,\u201d he said. The Biden administration has also taken issue with Apple\u2019s lack of support for mobile cloud services. Loosening this could allow users to access games and other cloud-based apps without having to pay for pricey hardware. Inside the debate The DOJ lawsuit claims Apple\u2019s behavior has illegally hindered competition, kept its customers locked into its products and prevented other companies from innovating. Although the Biden administration will have to prove these harms, some critics say any potential changes Apple could make will negatively impact the user experience. David McQueen, a research director at ABI Research, said he recognizes that the content and applications market should be open, and Apple needs to avoid monopolistic advantages that can restrict competition, push up prices or block innovation. But Apple\u2019s success stems in part to its tight grip on its products and services, keeping things intuitive and seamless. \u201cIf Apple is forced to comply, it could potentially spell the end to the provision of this consistent and unified user experience, although by the same token, consumers will be open to a greater choice of apps and services, helping more developers and providers,\u201d McQueen said. Chatterjee noted some people are drawn to the Apple family of products precisely because of the carefully managed ecosystem\u2019s ease of use. Apple may have to work that much harder to preserve the integrity of its experience, but any changes probably won\u2019t be enough to make customers to leave and go elsewhere. \u201cThe vast majority of Apple customers would probably be happier with some more choice and lower prices as long as it did not hamper their levels of customer experience, which is threatened by the less control Apple has over the experience,\u201d Chatterjee said. But he added those currently outside of the Apple ecosystem will likely benefit by \u201cplugging in opportunistically without having to go all in with Apple.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_01_tech_aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl", "text": "A London-based technology company is looking to \u201cdemocratize\u201d talent-identification and scouting in soccer using a mobile app. Free to download and available globally, the aiScout app allows aspiring soccer stars to enter virtual trials for professional clubs by uploading self-recorded footage of themselves completing a series of drills. It offers 75 exercises, designed to test a range of skills, with videos showing users how to complete them. Performances are automatically scored by artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The data can then be accessed by clubs, allowing their scouts to peruse scores for viable talent, honing their search with a variety of filters; from age and gender to position on the pitch. The app currently has two English Premier League (EPL) partners, Chelsea and Burnley, and clubs can tailor their in-app trials to meet specific needs and set their own benchmarks by having their academy players complete the same drills. \u201cWe\u2019re putting that data up front to make better use of [the scouts\u2019] time,\u201d said Richard Felton-Thomas, chief operating officer of ai.io, the company behind the app. \u201cTo say [to scouts], \u2018Go over to this place today because there\u2019s three players in that game that are all actually beating your Chelsea standard\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s going to be the best use of your time.\u2019\u201d It already appears to be working for some. Ben Greenwood had never had a trial with a professional club until he downloaded the app in 2019. After uploading footage of himself, the 17-year-old landed a trial with Chelsea, becoming the first user of the app to get a trial with a pro club. He signed a contract\u00a0with EPL team Bournemouth\u00a0in 2021. \u2018It\u2019s more about evolution\u2019 Having beta-tested in with players spanning 125 countries, Greenwood among them, 135 players have been trialed or signed by pro clubs or national teams through the app \u2014 which fully launched in September 2023 \u2014 according to Felton-Thomas. Just over 100,000 players make up the current database, but with over 100 clubs lined up to join Chelsea and Burnley, as well as a multi-year partnership with Major League Soccer in the US announced last May, Felton-Thomas projects user numbers to surge into the millions as the operation ramps up this year. Felton-Thomas said the \u201clion\u2019s share\u201d of its income comes from charging clubs a license fee to run the platform. Annual fees vary depending on the size of the club and the tools they require, ranging from six figures for \u201ctier one\u201d sides like Chelsea, to thousands of pounds for clubs lower down the footballing pyramid. The use of smart technology in sport continues to expand, including\u00a0AI commentary tools and wearable tech for elite athletes. The global market for sports analytics, valued at\u00a0$2.7 billion\u00a0in 2023, is projected to grow 22% by the end of the decade, according to market research firm Grand View Research. Should soccer talent scouts be concerned about being edged out by the arrival of AI in their industry? For Felton-Thomas, new technologies can co-exist with traditional methods. \u201cIt\u2019s more about evolution than revolution,\u201d Felton-Thomas explained. \u201cWe can\u2019t tell you when that player\u2019s actually in that match, how does he deal with adversity? What happens when he\u2019s 2-0 down? What happens when someone\u2019s shouting at him? What happens when he\u2019s just made a massive mistake?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got the ability to just augment real people to do their jobs better and faster, which then gives an opportunity to the player through the AI, but you\u2019re still actually just connecting them to the human on the other side, which is the club and the scout.\u201d While football remains ai.io\u2019s primary focus, the company is looking into opportunities in other sports to launch in the coming years. Further ahead, it may branch out beyond sports. \u201cYou think about the notion that you can be at home and analyze your movements, and how this could spin into health care, physical assessments for military disciplines and emergency services,\u201d Felton-Thomas told CNN.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/01/tech/aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_15_success_best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund", "text": "The average federal tax refund is more than $3,000, according to the latest data from the IRS. Since the majority of tax filers get a refund, there\u2019s a fair chance you could get hundreds if not thousands of dollars back in overpaid taxes, especially if you\u2019re also owed a refund from your state government. That money may feel like a windfall, and it\u2019s easy to squander it on a lot of little things. But if you\u2019re looking to improve your current financial situation, here are seven ideas to consider. Well, technically six, but you\u2019ll enjoy the seventh the most. 1. Pay off high-rate debt If you are carrying a balance on your credit card and are paying 20% to 30% in interest, make this your first priority to pay down. At such sky-high rates, \u201cthe debt can grow faster than you can pay it off,\u201d said Eric Bronnenkant, a certified financial planner and head of tax at Betterment, a robo-advisory financial services firm that also has a human advice team on hand to help clients. Keyana Russ, a certified financial planner at Four Ponds Financial Planning, concurred that people\u2019s awareness of how much money they\u2019re paying in interest over time doesn\u2019t always register. \u201cWhat I usually see is people paying the minimum, or they\u2019re charging everyday expenses and not paying off the bill at the end of the month. \u2026 They don\u2019t understand how much interest they\u2019re paying,\u201d Russ said. For example, if you\u2019re carrying a $3,000 balance at 27% interest and you only pay a required minimum of $97.50 every month, it will take you 240 months (which is 20 years) just to pay off the $3,000 \u2014 and, in addition, you will have paid $3,044.57 in interest, for a total of $6,044.57, according to Bankrate.com\u2019s calculator. 2. Create or add to an emergency fund You can use your refund to start or bolster an emergency fund. When it comes to costly emergencies, there are many Americans who don\u2019t have at least three months\u2019 worth of living expenses set aside, let alone enough to easily handle an unexpected bill of $1,000. Be sure to stash the money in a high-yield savings account at an FDIC-insured bank, Russ suggested, noting that the best interest rates are typically offered by online banks. If you have high-rate debt and you\u2019re lacking emergency savings, Russ suggested you might use a portion of your refund to attack your debt and the other portion to create an emergency fund. Bronnenkant favors paying off the high-rate debt first, but, if you\u2019re low on emergency savings and need a critical repair to help keep your job \u2014 such as on your car \u2014 he said it might make sense to set aside money for that repair and put the rest toward your credit card or other high-rate debt. 3. Make an extra payment on your mortgage If you\u2019re carrying a mortgage at a high rate (e.g., 7% to 8%), and you\u2019re not saddled with credit card debt, you might consider making an extra payment or two. \u201cIt can make a difference in the long run towards your principal,\u201d Russ said.\u00a0 You can even view it as an additional form of savings, in the sense that you\u2019re saving yourself an extra 7% \ufeffor so in interest on the portion of the principal you\u2019re paying down, Bronnenkant noted. 4. Invest in a Roth IRA If your income qualifies you to contribute to a Roth IRA, you can contribute up to $7,000 this year ($8,000 if you\u2019re at least 50) with after-tax savings. That money will grow untaxed until retirement, at which point your withdrawals will be tax-free and penalty-free after age 59-1/2, assuming the account has been open for at least five years. (And note: You can still make a 2023 Roth contribution until April 15 this year. The contribution limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if you\u2019re age 50 or older. Bolstering your tax-free retirement savings is great.\u00a0But if you need to access some of your money well before you retire, you may take out any part of your contributions tax-free and penalty-free at any time, \ufeffBronnenkant said. You would only be taxed and penalized if you withdrew the earnings on your contributions before age 59-1/2. (For more information on Roth IRA withdrawal rules, here is an easy-to-understand rundown from Charles Schwab.) 5. Contribute enough to your 401(k) in 2024 to get your full employer match Speaking of retirement savings, if you\u2019re not yet contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match from your employer, a refund can make that easier. Say you get $3,000 back. You can put that money in a high-yield savings account to earn interest. Then, on your workplace 401(k) site, change your paycheck contribution levels so that by the end of the year you will have contributed $3,000 more in pre-tax money than you otherwise would have. For instance, say you\u2019re paid every two weeks and you have 20 more paychecks left until the end of the year. You can boost you biweekly contributions by $150 per paycheck ($150 x 20 = $3,000). \u201cYou want to get the max match from your employer,\u201d Bronnenkant said. 6. Invest for shorter-term goals If in the next three to 10 years you expect to buy a home, take a once-in-a-lifetime trip, renovate a room, send your kids to summer camp or have any other expensive goal, you might consider investing your refund in a diversified mix of low-cost, broad market index funds. The shorter term your goal is, the less risk you want to take. If you need the money within three years, you might consider putting your refund in certificates of deposits and US Treasury bonds. But if your goal is five to 10 years out, and you\u2019re comfortable taking on some more risk and are willing to accept fluctuations in the market, Bronnenkant said, you might put no more than 30% of your refund in a stock index fund and 70% in a total market bond fund if your risk tolerance is conservative; or 50% in each if you have a moderate risk tolerance. If you plan on sending your child to college and you have a 529 plan, you can use your refund to boost your contributions to that plan, Russ said. You may also get a tax break for your contribution depending on the state where you live. 7. Have some fun Unless you\u2019re in truly dire financial straits, if you get a large refund, you might set aside a small portion to do whatever you truly enjoy. \u201cSometimes you just want to have fun and not have it be all business,\u201d Russ said. \u201cYou can set aside some of the money to have fun.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/15/success/best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "business"}}

The reversal comes after journalists and anchors at both NBC and its cable news sibling MSNBC publicly denounced the decision to hire McDaniel as a paid analyst in a stunning and unprecedented on-air rebuke of network brass that has embarrassed the Peacock Network. McDaniel, who recently stepped down from the RNC under pressure from former President Donald Trump, was involved in attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. As head of the RNC, she was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d In the years since, McDaniel continued to claim that the election had \u201cproblems\u201d and that Biden did not legitimately win the election, fanning the flames of election denialism. NBC\u2019s announcement Friday that it had hired McDaniel was quickly met with alarm by the network\u2019s journalists. The revolt spilled into public view on Sunday when McDaniel appeared on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with moderator Kristen Welker in her first interview since she was hired by the network. Welker disclosed that the interview had been scheduled to take place prior to NBC announcing McDaniel would become a paid contributor for the network, stating that she had no involvement in her hiring. Following the interview, Chuck Todd, NBC News\u2019 chief political analyst, delivered a stinging on-air criticism of NBC executives for their decision to hire McDaniel, telling Welker, \u201cI think our bosses owe you an apology for putting you in this situation.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a reason a lot of journalists at NBC News are uncomfortable with this,\u201d Todd said, explaining that under McDaniel, the RNC engaged in \u201cgaslighting\u201d and \u201ccharacter assassination\u201d when dealing with the news media. The following day, MSNBC hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough joined Todd in protesting the decision on their program \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d \u201cTo be clear, we believe NBC News should seek out conservative Republican voices to provide balance in their election coverage, but it should be conservative Republicans, not a person who used her position of power to be an anti-democracy election denier,\u201d\u00a0Brzezinski said. \u201cWe hope NBC will reconsider its decision. It goes without saying that she will not be a guest on \u2018Morning Joe\u2019 in her capacity as a paid contributor.\u201d Nicolle Wallace, host of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cDeadline: White House,\u201d later joined in the rebuke, saying on her program that the network\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel was nothing short of a potential threat to democracy. \u201cNBC News is, either wittingly or unwittingly, teaching election deniers that what they can do stretches well beyond appearing on our air and interviews to peddle lies about the sanctity and integrity of our elections,\u201d Wallace told viewers. Rachel Maddow \u2014 the network\u2019s biggest star \u2014 later devoted the first half-hour of her prime-time program to the controversy, saying the decision to hire McDaniel was \u201cinexplicable.\u201d Maddow took issue with McDaniel\u2019s long track record of demonizing the news media, labeling the press as \u201cfake news,\u201d and launching ugly attacks on NBC News journalists and MSNBC hosts. \u201cWe do not take it personally when we get attacked, when they say they want to put us on trial and execute us for treason,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so I want to associate myself with all my colleagues at MSNBC and NBC News who have voiced loud and principled objections to our company for putting on the payroll someone who hasn\u2019t just attacked us as journalists, but someone who is part of an ongoing project to get rid of our system of government,\u201d she said of McDaniel. \u201cSomeone who is still trying to convince Americans that this election stuff doesn\u2019t really work. That this last election wasn\u2019t a real result. That American elections are fraudulent.\u201c The on-air revolt ensnared NBC\u2019s top leaders, including NBCUniversal News Group chair Cesar Conde, NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown, who were responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring. MSNBC president Rashida Jones also did not object to the decision, people familiar with the matter said. In the wake of Conde\u2019s announcement to sever ties with McDaniel, MSNBC host Joy Reid and Maddow addressed the reversal on the network\u2019s air, praising the move as \u201cbold\u201d and \u201cstrong.\u201d \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/media/nbc-news-ousts-ronna-mcdaniel/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_23_business_takeaways-house-campus-antisemitism-hearing", "text": "The House Committee on Education and the Workforce\u2019s hearing on campus antisemitism Thursday came with no shortage of fiery exchanges between lawmakers and the heads of Northwestern University, Rutgers University and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). But unlike two prior hearings, Thursday\u2019s was the first to take place after a wave of pro-Palestinian encampments spread across campuses nationwide, disrupting learning and commencement ceremonies and ultimately causing many students to feel unsafe. Here are some of the most important takeaways from the hearing that lasted several hours. University heads can\u2019t win Northwestern President Michael Schill and Rutgers University President Dr. Jonathan Holloway negotiated with protesters rather than authorizing police to disband encampments, which UCLA Chancellor Gene Block ultimately did. Both approaches received considerable rebuke from lawmakers on the Republican-led committee. Schill and Holloway were accused of being complicit with protesters, though some Democratic lawmakers found their approaches admirable. \u201cI for one am interested in hearing and learning about what successful negotiation and de-escalation looks like in the context of protecting students and free speech,\u201d Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat from Washington state, said. Meanwhile, Block was criticized by some lawmakers for not authorizing police to step in sooner. Block agreed more action should have been taken earlier, saying, \u201cWith the benefit of hindsight, we should have been prepared to immediately remove the encampment if and when the safety of our community was put at risk.\u201d A lot of investigations but limited consequences yet In one of the hearing\u2019s tensest exchanges, Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik slammed Schill\u00a0for not taking any action against someone who allegedly told a Jewish student to \u201cgo back to Germany and get gassed.\u201d Schill said that he heard about that happening and \u201cit is being investigated.\u201d\u00a0So far, no students who are being investigated for various alleged acts of antisemitism have been expelled or suspended, he said. Rutgers\u2019 Holloway and UCLA\u2019s Block similarly said the universities have many active investigations underway. Holloway said his school has suspended four people and 19 others have received additional disciplinary actions. A bounty of lawyerly responses If you tuned in to Thursday\u2019s hearing and thought the responses university heads gave were pre-rehearsed, it\u2019s because they likely were. The three university heads at the hearing had the advantage of learning from the prior campus hearings. All were especially keen on not repeating the mistake made by University of Pennsylvania President Liz Magill and other school presidents who did not explicitly say calls for the genocide of Jews violated their codes of conduct. But the school leaders on Thursday still leaned into giving lawyerly responses, especially in tense lines of questioning to avoid being cornered into taking a stance on divisive issues. For instance, when Holloway was asked if he thought Israel\u2019s government was genocidal he responded, \u201cSir, I don\u2019t have an opinion on Israel\u2019s \u2014 in terms of that phrase.\u201d Meanwhile, Schill said more than once that he would not comment on individual students or faculty members in the hearing.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/business/takeaways-house-campus-antisemitism-hearing/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_25_business_summer-2024-box-office-earnings-forecast", "text": "The summer box office is off to a lukewarm start. Last\u00a0summer, blockbusters \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d\u00a0combined added nearly a billion dollars to the domestic box office, according to Comscore data. But this year, studios are betting on a large slate of mid-range sequels and prequels, as well as family-focused animated films to fill the Barbenheimer-shaped hole, including \u201cFuriosa: A Mad Max Saga,\u201d \u201cBad Boys: Ride or Die\u201d and \u201cInside Out 2.\u201d Coupled with production delays \u2014 the aftershocks of the multi-month-long Writers Guild and SAG-AFTRA strikes that are still reverberating across studios \u2014 the season that has historically drawn the biggest movie theater audiences is off to a rocky start, potentially hurting the yearly box office totals for 2024. \u201cSummer is the most important moviegoing season of the year, accounting on average for nearly 40% of the total domestic annual revenue, so as goes the summer so goes the year,\u201d Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore, told CNN. \u201cBarring some major overperformances, this summer looks like it\u2019ll be down 20% to 25% in box office grosses between May and August from last year,\u201d said analyst Shawn Robbins, founder and owner of Box Office Theory. The elusive $100-million opening weekend Until 2020, the period between Memorial Day weekend and Labor Day Monday could be counted on to bring in upwards of $4 billion in domestic revenue, according to Comscore data. Summer 2023 saw the first post-pandemic $4-billion summer. Propelled by the success of \u201cSound of Freedom,\u201d \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d and the record-breaking $155 million \u201cBarbie\u201d opening weekend, summer 2023 grossed $4.09 billion, a 19.2% jump from the year prior. \u201cBarbie\u201d was distributed by Warner Bros., which is owned by CNN\u2019s parent company Warner Bros. Discovery. An opening weekend north of $100 million is typically only seen in intellectual property-driven action films like Star Wars movies and superhero flicks, as well as animated family fare like \u201cThe Incredibles 2\u201d and \u201cFinding Dory.\u201d So far this year, no movie has crossed that threshold. \u201cSans a Marvel movie to provide a $100-million-plus opening weekend to get the momentum going, this summer will have to make up ground in June and July,\u201d said Dergarabedian, adding that this summer has so far been a \u201clate bloomer.\u201d Disney offerings could make or break the summer box office Two movies that analysts say could cross the $100 million threshold this summer are \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d and \u201cInside Out 2,\u201d both of which are distributed by Walt Disney Studios. The studio\u2019s first wide release of 2024 under its flagship \u201cDisney\u201d banner is set to be \u201cInside Out 2,\u201d an anomaly for the company and the movie business, according to Daniel Loria, editorial director at Box Office Pro, which collects sales and showtimes data from thousands of movie theaters across the United States. (Disney-owned 20th Century Entertainment released its first movie of the year, \u201cThe First Omen,\u201d in April.) \u201cI can\u2019t think of any other year where a studio as vital to this industry sits out the entire first half of the year,\u201d Loria told CNN, adding that this is in large part due to production delays and schedule shifts caused by months of back and forth between studios, the Writers Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA, the actors\u2019 union. \u201cWe tend to overemphasize the effect of Hollywood\u2019s 2023 labor strikes at the box office, but it\u2019s hard not to cite it when you look at the number of releases to have hit theaters from major studios in the first half of the year.\u201d Disney has not responded to CNN\u2019s request for comment. Loria also emphasized that Disney\u2019s summer offerings, both from its Pixar and Marvel divisions, will be critical to how the 2024 box office performs overall. \u201cInside Out 2\u201d is forecast to open anywhere between $80 million and $100 million, according to Box Office Pro pre-sales data. Pixar\u2019s offerings in recent years have fallen flat; 2022\u2019s \u201cLightyear\u201d debuted at $50.5 million domestically, while 2023\u2019s \u201cElemental\u201d made $29.6 million its opening weekend. Meanwhile, \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine,\u201d the only Marvel property release this summer, is expected to reinvigorate audience enthusiasm after \u201cThe Marvels\u201d disappointed last November with a $47 million opening weekend. Last week, ticket seller Fandango announced that \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d had broken the company\u2019s 2024 record for best first-day ticket presales, beating out \u201cDune: Part Two.\u201d The film also had the best first day of ticket sales for an R-rated film in Fandango\u2019s 24-year history, the company told CNN. \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine has the potential to be the second movie (after 2021\u2019s \u201cSpiderman: No Way Home\u201d) to earn a $200 million opening weekend of the post-pandemic era,\u201d said Loria. \u201cWe are still two months out, but if pre-sales and awareness continue at this pace, we believe the film can open between $170 million and $210 million.\u201d \u201cDespicable Me 4\u201d and \u201cInside Out 2\u201d \u201clook particularly strong, and \u2018Deadpool & Wolverine\u2019 will hands down be the top film of the summer,\u201d said Dergarabedian. Studios still trying to find their footing Industry experts agree that the 2024 box office has been sluggish so far, but remain hopeful that the box office can rebound by the end of the year and beyond. \u201cBox office earnings have been down largely because of staggered gaps between widely appealing releases in the first half of the year,\u201d said Robbins. \u201cThat\u2019s been the status quo in the post-pandemic era for many reasons, mostly outside the control of theatrical exhibition. The industry had only a brief period between the impact of COVID production delays followed by the writers\u2019 and actors\u2019 strikes last year.\u201d Robbins added that there\u2019s still time for strong titles in the second half of the year to fill the gap, including September\u2019s \u201cBeetlejuice Beetlejuice\u201d and \u201cTransformers One,\u201d and October\u2019s \u201cJoker: Folie \u00e0 Deux.\u201d \u201cMoviegoing habits have changed drastically since the\u00a0pandemic, but we continue to see significant enthusiasm when it comes to the theatrical experience,\u201d said Loria. \u201cThe data clearly shows that audiences can still support the studio tentpole model \u2014 but identifying the movies that will become those blockbuster hits continues to be as difficult to predict as ever before.\u201d Box Office Pro projects that the 2024 box office will gross $8.2 billion, about 10% lower than last year\u2019s $9 billion. The domestic earnings for 2023 were the highest since the pandemic, but still fell roughly $2 billion short of pre-pandemic yearly sales, according to Comscore.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/business/summer-2024-box-office-earnings-forecast/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_business_scarlett-johansson-open-ai-nightcap", "text": "If you\u2019ve been snoozing through the Scarlett Johansson-OpenAI drama this week, let me quickly catch you up quickly: A woman rejected a man\u2019s request, twice, and he responded like a child \u2014 demonstrating just one of the reasons the world needs to be skeptical of the people and companies profiting from their own breathless AI hype. Bear with me for the slightly longer version. Back in September, Scarlett Johansson, who played the hauntingly complex AI assistant in the 2013 Spike Jonze film \u201cHer,\u201d got a request from OpenAI\u2019s CEO, Sam Altman. He wanted to hire Johansson to voice his company\u2019s newest ChatGPT model, \u201cSky.\u201d She said no. Several months later, just days before the product launched, he asked her to reconsider. But before she had a chance to say no a second time, OpenAI released the new model with a voice that sounded strikingly similar to Johansson\u2019s. The AI\u2019s debut was both mind-blowing and cringe-y. Mind-blowing because of the bot\u2019s apparent sophistication and human-like qualities, and cringe-worthy given how uncomfortably flirty it sounded, like a caricature of a computer developer\u2019s fantasy. Johansson quickly lawyered up, saying Monday she was \u201cshocked, angered and in disbelief\u201d that Altman would use a voice \u201cso eerily similar\u201d to her own. The company, which hit pause on the update after the legal threat from Johansson, said the voice \u201cbelongs to a different professional actress using her own natural speaking voice\u201d and was not intended to resemble Johansson\u2019s. Altman \u2014 who is on the record about his love of the Spike Jonze film, and even tweeted the word \u201cher\u201d on the day of the launch \u2014 apologized to Johansson on Monday. Safety takes a backseat The rift reflects a broader anxiety among artists, academics and even some AI pioneers over the speed at which tech companies are building and releasing AI tools to the public, with seemingly little regard for intellectual property and safety concerns. It also points to one of the original sins of AI that its developers have yet to resolve: that all of these products are being greenlit, funded and built by the 0.01% of Silicon Valley \u2014 a largely young, white and male cohort, whose natural human biases are getting baked in to the AI in ways that even they don\u2019t fully understand, or are aware of. OpenAI was forced to confront some of those concerns late last week, after two prominent employees left the company. One, Jan Leike, wrote on X that the company\u2019s \u201csafety culture and processes have taken a backseat to shiny products.\u201d The other, OpenAI\u2019s co-founder and chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, announced he was\u00a0leaving to work on another project, without disclosing details, though his departure is especially notable given his key role in (briefly, dramatically) firing Altman last year over concerns that Altman was pushing AI technology \u201ctoo far, too fast.\u201d Altman even acknowledged Leike\u2019s point, saying: \u201cHe\u2019s right we have a lot more to do; we are committed to doing it.\u201d  That\u2019s the kind of diplomatic candor that\u2019s helped make Altman, a 39-year-old billionaire, the face of \u201cresponsible AI.\u201d He is a thoughtful, charismatic figure, and he really wants us to trust that he\u2019s looking out for the regular folks as he mints money and races to beat Google and Meta to the AI mountaintop. I\u2019d be curious to ask him, though, when was the last time he watched \u201cHer\u201d \u2014 one of his favorite movies that he called \u201cincredibly prophetic\u201d \u2014 all the way to the end. Because part of what makes the film great is how Johansson\u2019s warm and empathetic voice lulls the main character (and the audience, ultimately) into an almost hypnotic state of infatuation. Maybe the ease of human-AI companionship is acceptable, or even preferable, to the messy realities of real love, we wonder as we watch Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s character walk alone on a crowded beach, the camera of his phone peeking out of his shirt pocket, smiling because he\u2019s so happy with his AI lover. Of course, by the end of the movie, the AI\u2019s have decamped to some other plane of existence, leaving the humans, with all their messy human needs, to take care of one another once again. \u201cBeing friends with AI will be so much easier than forging bonds with human beings,\u201d wrote Wired editor Brian Barrett in a recent essay about the movie. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s better. Sometimes it\u2019s much worse.\u201d \u2014CNN\u2019s Clare Duffy and Brian Fung contributed reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/business/scarlett-johansson-open-ai-nightcap/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_25_business_burger-prices-memorial-day", "text": "Burger patties, buns and ketchup prices are high. But even with the increases, your home-grilled burger could end up being relatively inexpensive this year thanks to steep discounts offered by retailers vying for budget-conscious customers. In recent months, grocery prices have stayed flat and even started to fall. But some grilling staples are more expensive compared to last year. In the 12 months through April 21, ground beef prices rose 6.4% by volume compared to the period from a year earlier, according to US retail sales data from Circana. Packaged hamburger and hot dog bun prices were up 7% while potato chips were up 6.9%. Condiment prices saw a sharper jump with ketchup rising 8.9%, hot sauce increasing 7.6% and regular barbecue sauce spiking 14.6%. Some items had modest increases, like hot dogs, which went up by 1.4%. But the increases don\u2019t take into account the year\u2019s many Memorial Day deals. \u201cThis is going to be a year for aggressive discounting,\u201d said Chris DuBois, EVP and practice leader for the fresh foods practice at Circana. Retailers \u201cwant to win the customer trip,\u201d he said. \u201cI would expect pretty sharp discounts to be able to bring people in.\u201d It\u2019s discount season Retailers often offer sale prices ahead of major holidays in order to lure in customers. For stores, it can be worthwhile to break even, or take a loss, on certain discounted items in order just to get people in the door. Once inside, shoppers may well fill up their carts with full-priced items. But if they don\u2019t, at least they won\u2019t be shopping at a competitor. This year, in particular, is stacking up to be a really good one for deals. Consumers remain  worried about inflation and have been spending less as a result. Retailers, vying for much-needed foot traffic, have already been slashing prices, and are adding more discounts for the holiday. Target recently said that it is lowering prices on thousands of items. In addition, the big-box retailer is offering a number of Memorial Day deals for a limited time, including buy one, get one 20% off ground beef and burgers for rewards members for May 19-27. Members also get a discount on soda in that period and all customers get a deal on chips. Supermarket chain Kroger also has Memorial Day specials, including reduced rates for home brand sliced cheese, hamburger buns and potato chips. Meanwhile, low-cost grocer Aldi, which has been gaining popularity with its no frills approach and bargain prices, is reducing the prices of steak and chicken breasts through July 10, among other deals. Chicken products are among the items that have gotten less expensive this year, even before discounts. Chicken breast prices, for example,\u00a0fell 2.5% in the year through April, according to Circana, while wings have plunged 9.2%.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/business/burger-prices-memorial-day/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_20_success_interest-rates-savings-cash", "text": "The Federal Reserve\u2019s benchmark interest rate remains at a 23-year high. That\u2019s thanks to the central bank\u2019s decision Wednesday to once again hold it steady, as it has done at the policy-making committee\u2019s past five meetings. That decision may be disappointing to some investors, homebuyers and those with a lot of credit card debt, since movement in the Fed\u2019s overnight lending rate influences rates \u2014 directly or indirectly \u2014 on consumer financial products (e.g., credit cards, bank loans and mortgages). But\u00a0with the Fed signaling that no rate cuts are likely until summer, it also means anyone with savings still has at least a few more months to make hay of their stash. That\u2019s because you can still get inflation-beating interest rates that will grow any money you have set aside for emergencies, vacations, down payments or any other goal in your sights over the next several years. However, that won\u2019t happen if you just let it sit in a traditional checking or savings account that yields next to nothing. There are more lucrative, low-risk options out there, with rates that are still at or near their peaks. \u201cBut perhaps not for much longer,\u201d said Ted Rossman, senior analyst at Bankrate. \u201cIf one of those fits into your financial plans, it\u2019s best to act soon.\u201d So, consider the following options when deciding where to park your hard-earned savings. High-yield online savings accounts The average annual percentage yield on bank savings accounts was just 0.52% as of March 13, according to Bankrate. That average is kept low by the biggest brick-and-mortar banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, which still are offering a paltry 0.01%. By contrast, there are still FDIC-insured online banks offering inflation-beating rates of between 4.35% and 5.35% on their high-yield savings accounts. Generally speaking, these are the best vehicles in which to keep your emergency funds for quick, easy access. Choosing between an account that pays 0.52% and one that pays 5.35% can mean forfeiting hundreds of dollars in interest. \u201cIf you put $10,000 in a savings account, that\u2019s a difference of $496 in interest earnings over the course of the year, assuming monthly compounding,\u201d Rossman said. While the rates on high-yield savings accounts have gone down a bit in recent months, \u201cwidespread cuts in online savings account rates are unlikely until the first Fed rate cut is near,\u201d said Ken Tumin, founder of DepositAccounts.com. As with any bank savings rate, high-yield savings account\u00a0rates\u00a0can change overnight, and the bank may not alert you when it lowers it. So make sure to check your monthly statement. Certificates of deposits Another high-return, low-risk investment that is great for money you likely won\u2019t need to tap for a few months or even a couple of years is a certificate of deposit. You can get the best returns on CDs through a brokerage such as Schwab, E*Trade or Fidelity. That\u2019s because you can comparison shop for CDs from any number of FDIC-insured banks and will not have to set up individual accounts with each institution. As of March 13, the average rate on a one-year CD was 1.95%, but some banks are offering as much are 5.4%. If you can get a one-year CD at, say, 5.4%, you will make $540 on a $10,000 investment. To get the greatest benefit from a CD, you have to leave the money invested for a fixed period. You can always access your principal sooner if you need to, but there may be early withdrawal penalties. As of March 20, CDs listed on Schwab.com with durations from three months up to three years were all yielding between 5.2% and 5.51%. CD rates on durations between four and 10 years ranged from 4.40% to 5.15%. Say you invest $10,000 in a one-year CD with a 5.36%\u00a0APY. At the end of that period, you\u2019d get your principal back plus $536 in interest when the CD matures, according to Bankrate\u2019s CD calculator. If you chose a two-year CD at 5.25%, you\u2019d bank an extra $1,078, assuming compounding interest. The same investment in a five-year CD at 5.15% would earn $2,854. \u201cIt makes sense to go long with CDs. To hedge your bets, include terms from one to five years. Starting a CD ladder will provide this mix,\u201d Tumin said. If you don\u2019t go through a brokerage you may get a reasonable deal from your primary bank, Tumin said. For example, he noted, Wells Fargo is still offering up to 5.01% on both 4-month and 7-month CDs. Or, at Bank of America, you can get up to 4.75% on a 7-month CD. But Tumin cautions that with any big bank CD you should take your money out at the end of the term, otherwise your bank may automatically renew it and lock you in to a much lower-yielding CD. Money market accounts and funds If you don\u2019t want to set up an online savings account at another bank, your own bank may offer you a money market deposit account that pays a higher yield than your regular checking or savings accounts. Money market accounts may have higher minimum deposit requirements than a regular savings account, but they are more liquid than a fixed-term certificate of deposit or Treasury bill, meaning they give you access to your money more quickly while still potentially giving you some of the highest yields available, said Doug Ornstein, senior manager for integrated solutions at TIAA Wealth Management. But don\u2019t confuse money market accounts with money market mutual funds, which invest in short-term, low-risk debt instruments. As of March 19, they had an average 7-day yield of 5.14%, according to the Crane Money Fund Index, which tracks the top 100 taxable money market funds. Unlike money market deposit accounts, money market mutual funds are not insured by the FDIC. But if you invest in a money market fund through a brokerage, your overall account is likely to be insured through the Securities Investor Protection Corp, which offers protection in the event your brokerage ever goes under. Treasury bills and notes Another option for money you can leave untouched anywhere from several months to a few years is to buy short-term Treasury bills and medium-term notes, which are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. Three- and six-month bills had yields of 5.39% and 5.33%\u00a0respectively on March 20 before the Fed\u2019s meeting ended, while nine-month and one-year bills were offering 5.19% and 5.08%\u00a0respectively, according to rates posted on Schwab.com for a $25,000 investment. Rates on Treasury notes with durations from two years to 10 years ranged between 4.29% and 4.72%. If you\u2019re someone who manages your portfolio like a hawk, you may feel comfortable buying T-bills on your own from TreasuryDirect.gov. But if you don\u2019t, it might be easier just to buy new issues through your brokerage account or invest in a short-term bond index fund or ETF, said Andy Smith, executive director of financial planning at Edelman Financial Engines. And if you\u2019re looking at money that will be needed in three to five years, you might consider a diversified fund of highly rated government and corporate bonds, Ornstein said. An 18-month AAA-rated corporate bond, for instance, was yielding 4.82% this week, while the three-year was at 4.49%. Meanwhile, three-year AAA-rated municipal bonds (which are issued by local governments) had a rate of 3.98%, according to Schwab.com. Don\u2019t chase yield When deciding on the best accounts and investments for your specific goals and peace of mind, it may pay to consult a fee-only fiduciary adviser \u2014 meaning, someone who doesn\u2019t get paid a commission to sell you a particular investment. What you\u2019ll always want to do is build in flexibility for yourself so you can easily access cash, regardless of your timeline for key goals. \u201cWhat happens if something changes and you need that down payment a lot sooner \u2014 or your parents need medical care fast?\u201d Smith said. That means balancing your desire for great yield with a need and desire for ease of access without penalty. Translation: Don\u2019t chase yield for yield\u2019s sake. Think of it this way, Ornstein said: Unless you have huge sums to invest or are an institutional investor, the difference between getting a 5.1% yield versus 5% is negligible, and in fact it could even cost you more if there are penalties for taking your money out early. \u201cMost of the time convenience is really important. Give up the 0.1%,\u201d he advised.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/20/success/interest-rates-savings-cash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_economy_consumer-travel-inflation-memorial-day", "text": "Americans may be sick and tired of dealing with high prices across pretty much every aspect of their lives, but inflation hasn\u2019t yet squashed the travel bug. And this Memorial Day weekend could be a case in point: Travelers are expected to come out in record-setting droves. US airports on Thursday saw their second-ever busiest day, as nearly 2.9 million travelers were screened at Transportation Security Administration checkpoints. Friday was expected to be even busier, TSA said. Traffic on the ground won\u2019t be any less packed: AAA is projecting that a record 38.4 million people will take road trips over the long weekend. Three-plus years of high inflation have taken their toll on Americans\u2019 budgets and, especially, their mindsets. But even though people may be feeling pinched, some are still willing to spend \u2014 if not splurge \u2014 on travel and leisure. \u201cThe truth is that although people complain about the economy and complain about inflation, overall, households are in very good shape in the United States,\u201d Gus Faucher, PNC Financial Services\u2019 chief economist, told CNN on Friday. Inflation has slowed during the past couple of years, pulling back significantly from its peak of 9.1% in June 2022. In April, it measured 3.4% annually, according to the Consumer Price Index. But it is still well above pre-pandemic levels: In February 2020, CPI measured 2.3% annually. Price hikes continue to hit hard, especially where consumers feel it most (their shelter, food and transportation). However, the job market is historically strong and incomes are outpacing inflation. \u201cPeople see [high gas] prices, and they feel like they\u2019re not keeping up,\u201d Faucher said. \u201cBut the truth is, they are. We see that very clearly in the consumer spending numbers.\u201d Taking flight for Taylor, buying tickets for Mickey Consumer spending has increased for 12 consecutive months, Commerce Department data shows. And those pandemic effects still run deep: Americans are putting their cash, and their credit, toward experiences. Disney\u2019s parks and experiences revenue grew roughly 11% during the second quarter from the year prior. The company said that while attendance isn\u2019t at the elevated levels seen following the end of Covid pandemic restrictions, it still rose at its US and Hong Kong Disneyland resorts. But it\u2019s not just Disney \u2014 consumers\u2019 appetite for travel remains robust and is expected to ramp up as the summer season kicks off. \u201cDemand continues to be strong, and we see a record spring and summer travel season,\u201d said Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian during a call with analysts last month. \u201cDelta\u2019s core consumers are in a healthy position and travel remains a top purchase priority.\u201d United Airlines also said in April that it expects both the airline and industry as a whole to report record passenger volumes during the summer. Credit some of that to Ms. Swift: United and Delta said this week that demand is on the rise for Taylor Swift\u2019s \u201cEras Tour\u201d destinations in Europe. And there is some good news on the inflation front in that regard: Airline fares dropped in April from March and are actually down a little more than 1% from February 2020, CPI data shows. Spending by land and by sea Cruise transactions, which include bookings and spending on board, were 16% higher in the first quarter of this year compared to the first quarter of 2019, according to a recent Mastercard Economics Institute report. The jump in cruise spending may be due to \u201cpersistent price increases in the hotel industry,\u201d the Mastercard report said. That\u2019s made cruises \u201ca relatively more budget-friendly option in many cases.\u201d Yet, many large hotel chains say they aren\u2019t seeing a significant pullback. For instance, Marriott International raised its full-year earnings guidance in first-quarter results reported on May 1. The company saw its global revenue per available room climb 4.2% from the year before. \u201cOur 2024 outlook still assumes continued sturdy travel demand and a continuation of current macroeconomic trends,\u201d said Kathleen Oberg, chief financial officer at Marriott, during a call with analysts. The boom times might not last much longer However, nothing lasts forever. Other key players in the travel industry have reported a similar trend this earnings season. Americans, especially lower-income consumers, have pulled back spending at retailers as goods inflation outpaces wage growth. They\u2019ve even become frugal with some experience-based spending like dining out, opting instead to eat at home. Still, some executives have warned that the appetite for travel doesn\u2019t match the boom seen right after Covid pandemic restrictions were lifted, and that the boost from that period is fading. Another source of potential woe is the uncertain economic environment. Pandemic-era savings have been spent while sticky inflation and high inflation rates eat into household budgets. The labor market has shown remarkable resilience through the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate hikes, but it cooled in April. Expedia Group lowered its full-year guidance, citing in part the slower-than-expected growth in gross bookings during the first quarter.   \u201cWe saw a healthy but more normalized market environment for travel globally,\u201d CEO Peter Kern told analysts earlier this month. \u201cWe are largely past the pandemic-driven recovery.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/economy/consumer-travel-inflation-memorial-day/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_media_trump-unified-reich", "text": "The phrase \u201cunified Reich,\u201d which appeared in a video posted by the Trump campaign and caused a firestorm of controversy, appears to have originated as placeholder text in a collection of video templates created in 2023 by a 30-year-old Turkish freelance graphic designer. The video, posted and subsequently removed by the Trump campaign earlier this week, included imagined headlines that newspapers might run if former President Donald Trump is reelected. Among them: \u201cWhat\u2019s next for America,\u201d under which the fictional article displays language that many associate with Nazi Germany, including the phrase, \u201ccreation of a unified Reich.\u201d The reference was condemned by President Joe Biden, and the Trump campaign said it didn\u2019t create the video \u2013 it was reposted by a staffer who didn\u2019t see that particular text. Bizarrely, the fake article\u2019s text appears to trace its origins to a graphic designer named Enes \u015eim\u015fek who lives near Istanbul. In an exclusive interview with CNN, \u015eim\u015fek said that the Trump ad appears to have been created from video graphics he built in May of last year, designed to give customers the option of building something that looked like an old-fashioned newsreel. \u015eim\u015fek said he actually searched Google for text about World War I \u2013 not World War II \u2013 and copied language he found and pasted it into in the newspaper article: \u201cGerman industrial strength and production had significantly increased after 1871, driven by the creation of a unified Reich.\u201d As first reported by the AP, the phrase appeared to have been lifted from a Wikipedia entry on World War I. According to Wikipedia\u2019s logs, that phrase was created on November 15, 2022, and it has since been removed. The phrase does not reference Nazi Germany. It was supposed to be dummy text \u2013 placeholder language that the customer could ultimately replace, he said. \u015eim\u015fek built the template to allow the customer who purchased it to swap in their own language. But \u015eim\u015fek believes the Trump video kept the text from his original template. \u015eim\u015fek says he has sold just 16 copies of the template at $21 a pop. It has appeared in at least two other online videos: a French-language video posted to Facebook that contains the dummy text and a music video posted to YouTube. They appear to have no political context. CNN discovered the video template on Video Hive, a motion graphics template store. After \u015eim\u015fek\u00a0was contacted through the contact form on the video template page, he responded via email that he was the creator of the template. \u201cI didn\u2019t know it is my power to change politics \u2026 I don\u2019t know what could be crazier than that,\u201d said \u015eim\u015fek in a video call. \u201cImagine if your work shakes a country.\u201d A web cache confirms the template dates back at least a year, long before the Trump ad was shared online. What is a video template? Rather than create every video from scratch, video editors often search online graphics stores for templates they can manipulate and insert in their work. They often pay a fee to the designer for access to the template. Motion graphics templates are a useful tool in video production, noted Bill Byrne, a motion graphics designer and Lecturer of Arts and Entertainment Technologies at the University of Texas at Austin. \u201dTemplates are designed to speed up the production process and to do it quickly and cheaply,\u201d said Byrne. According to Byrne, the inclusion of the placeholder text in the final video appears to be an oversight by the video\u2019s creator. \u201cAnd an unfortunate one,\u201d he added. A flummoxed designer Outside Istanbul, \u015eim\u015fek was at his desk in his office when he noticed that his work had somehow made news in American politics. Surprised by the phrase being attributed to Trump, \u015eim\u015fek attempted to correct the record. According to an email he shared with CNN, \u015eim\u015fek sent a letter to Support@truthsocial.com with the email subject line: \u201cFrom the \u2018REICH\u2019 video template Author.\u201d \u201cHi. I am the initial author of that \u2018REICH\u2019 video template. If you need an official statement just let me know,\u201d wrote \u015eim\u015fek. He did not receive a reply. For \u015eim\u015fek, seeing his work end up in the spotlight of American politics \u2014 a country he has never even visited \u2014 has been surreal. \u201cIt\u2019s really the most unthinkable thing that\u2019s ever happened to me,\u201d said \u015eim\u015fek, who doesn\u2019t follow either American or Turkish politics. \u015eim\u015fek was again floored when he saw the video of Biden responding to the Trump video. When asked what his message to Biden about Trump\u2019s video would be, he said: \u201cThis is not his fault.\u201d \u201cAnd also, I am Enes,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to come to America.\u201d Envato, the marketplace that hosts the template, contacted \u015eim\u015fek on Thursday and gave a directive to remove the \u201cunified Reich\u201d phrase from the template or face its deletion. \u015eim\u015fek replaced the phrase, and wrote a blog post in an attempt to further clarify the story. A company spokesperson confirmed the account and said that while \u201cthe templates available on our site are always reviewed under a strict set of guidelines for appropriateness, we cannot apply the same screening to the end user and their uses of our content.\u201d \u201cWhen I was doing this job, I never even thought that one day such an event would happen,\u201d \u015eim\u015fek wrote on his blog post. \u201cBy the way, thank you to Trump for choosing my template.\u201d A history of Nazi language Trump has made several allusions to Nazi imagery in the past, including using the phrase \u201cpoisoning the blood of our country\u201d when referencing immigrants, which echoed Adolf Hitler\u2019s Mein Kampf. Trump also allegedly praised Hitler, according to former White House chief of staff John Kelly, who was quoted by CNN\u2019s Jim Sciutto in his new book \u201cThe Return of Great Powers.\u201d Kelly commented: \u201cHe said, \u2018Well, but Hitler did some good things.\u2019 I said, \u2018Well, what?\u2019 And he said, \u2018Well, (Hitler) rebuilt the economy.\u2019 Trump has denied the comments and that the conversation happened. The recent video shared by Trump\u2019s campaign led some critics to believe the phrase\u2019s inclusion in the video was purposeful \u2013 meant to be an ideological dog whistle. The Trump campaign did not respond directly to questions about the origins of the \u201cunified Reich\u201d language in the video but reiterated a previous statement issued earlier this week that said the ad had been reposted by a staffer. \u201cThis was not a campaign video, it was created by a random account online and reposted by a staffer who clearly did not see the word, while the President was in court,\u201d Karoline Leavitt, a campaign spokesperson, said in a statement. The Biden campaign, however, said this was part of a pattern of troubling rhetoric from Trump. \u201cThis week\u2019s video is part of a pattern and reflects Donald Trump\u2019s values and embrace of white supremacists and antisemitism,\u201d said James Singer, a Biden campaign spokesperson. \u201cHe does so repeatedly, explicitly, and with overwhelming clarity. Suggesting otherwise or excusing his behavior only aids and abets his hate.\u201d According to the Bulwark, the original source of the video was from an anonymous Pro-Trump meme account posting on X under the alias @ramble_rants. The Dilley Meme Team, a collective of pro-Trump meme makers whose ranks include @ramble_rants, did not return a request for comment. \u015eim\u015fek, aware of the controversy, urged people to chill out. \u201cI love all the American people,\u201d \u015eim\u015fek said. \u201cAnd please calm down. This is just a template. And, also, I\u2019m not a Nazi.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/media/trump-unified-reich/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "business"}}

While speaking remotely via webcam at VivaTech 2024 in Paris, Musk described a future where jobs would be \u201coptional.\u201d \u201cIf you want to do a job that\u2019s kinda like a hobby, you can do a job,\u201d Musk said. \u201cBut otherwise, AI and the robots will provide any goods and services that you want.\u201d For this scenario to work, he said, there would need to be \u201cuniversal high income\u201d \u2013 not to be confused with universal basic income, although he did not share what that could look like. (UBI refers to the government giving a certain amount of money to everyone regardless of how much they earn.) \u201cThere would be no shortage of goods or services,\u201d he said. AI capabilities have surged over the past few years, fast enough that regulators, companies and consumers are still figuring out how to use the technology responsibly. Concerns also continue to mount over how various industries and jobs will change as AI proliferates in the market. In January, researchers at MIT\u2019s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab found workplaces are adopting AI much more slowly than some had expected and feared. The report also said the majority of jobs previously identified as vulnerable to AI were not economically beneficial for employers to automate at that time. Experts also largely believe that many jobs that require a high emotional intelligence and human interaction will not need replacing, such as mental health professionals, creatives and teachers. Musk has been outspoken about his concerns around AI. During the keynote on Thursday, he called the technology his biggest fear. He cited the \u201cCulture Book Series\u201d by Ian Banks, a utopian fictionalized look at a society run by advanced technology, as the most realistic and \u201cthe best envisioning of a future AI.\u201d In a job-free future, though, Musk questioned whether people would feel emotionally fulfilled. \u201cThe question will really be one of meaning\u00a0 \u2013 if the computer and robots can do everything better than you, does your life have meaning?\u201d he said.\u00a0 \u201cI do think there\u2019s perhaps still a role for humans in this \u2013 in that we may give AI meaning.\u201d He also used his stage time to urge parents to limit the amount of social media that children can see because \u201cthey\u2019re being programmed by a dopamine-maximizing AI.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/tech/elon-musk-ai-your-job/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_media_israels-seizure-ap-equipment-free-press", "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:\u00a0A version of this article first appeared in the \u201cReliable Sources\u201d newsletter.\u00a0Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here. Israel\u00a0must do better. The\u00a0Benjamin Netanyahu-led country on Tuesday took the outrageous step of seizing a camera and other video equipment used by\u00a0The Associated Press\u00a0to\u00a0broadcast a live feed of\u00a0Gaza\u00a0\u2014 a decision the country only reversed amid severe backlash from free press advocates and following a\u00a0White House\u00a0request. \u201cAs soon as we learned about the reports, the White House and the\u00a0State Department\u00a0immediately engaged with the Government of Israel at high levels to express our serious concern and ask them to reverse this action,\u201d\u00a0National Security Council\u00a0spokesperson\u00a0Adrienne Watson\u00a0told me, an action that unquestionably played a key role in persuading the Israeli government to publicly backtrack. The brazen anti-media action against the AP on Tuesday, however, is only the latest from Israel, which over the course of the country\u2019s bloody war on the terrorist group\u00a0Hamas\u00a0has engaged in a pattern of behavior that calls into serious question its commitment to a free and open press. The country\u2019s leadership has for months\u00a0evaded questions\u00a0and calls for accountability over the killing and treatment of journalists in the region as it conducts a protracted military operation in Gaza. Last month, it passed a law that\u00a0allowed it to shut down\u00a0the\u00a0Qatari-owned\u00a0Al Jazeera\u00a0network, with authorities raiding the outlet\u2019s offices and taking the channel off the air. And on Tuesday, it used that same law to target the AP, ostensibly confiscating its equipment because it provided its video feed to Al Jazeera, one of its thousands of global clients. Israel is the only democracy in the middle east \u2014 and it should act like it. The country should put on proud display the principles and ideals that make up a democratic society, serving as a beacon of light in a region otherwise made up of repressive regimes. And as NSC spokesperson Watson noted to me Tuesday, \u201cThe free press is an essential pillar of democracy and members of the media, including AP, do vital work that must be respected.\u201d Unfortunately, the Israeli government\u2019s record on the press no longer reflects what one would expect the leadership of a proud and thriving democracy to look like. Its behavior, instead, is starting to resemble the actions of oppressive governments who seek to control the flow of information and quash dissent. While Israel bowed to pressure on Tuesday and returned the AP\u2019s equipment, the government notably offered no public apology to the renowned wire service. Instead, Israel\u2019s\u00a0Communications Minister Shlomo Karhi\u00a0simply said that he had \u201cordered that the equipment be returned to the AP news agency.\u201d The lack of remorse, coupled with the fact that the new law that was wielded against Al Jazeera remains in effect, speaks volumes about the government\u2019s view of the news media amid its devastating war with Hamas. As the AP noted after its equipment was returned Tuesday, the underlying issues are still unresolved. \u201cWhile we are pleased with this development,\u201d the outlet said, \u201cwe remain concerned about the Israeli government\u2019s use of the foreign broadcaster law and the ability of independent journalists to operate freely in Israel.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/media/israels-seizure-ap-equipment-free-press/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_22_media_ronna-mcdaniel-nbc", "text": "NBC News on Friday announced that it had hired Ronna McDaniel, the former Republican National Committee chair who has repeatedly\u00a0attacked the network and its journalists,\u00a0assailed the\u00a0news\u00a0media as \u201cfake news\u201d and promoted false claims around the 2020\u00a0vote,\u00a0as an on-air commentator\u00a0ahead of the 2024 presidential election. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be a more important moment to have a voice like Ronna\u2019s on the team,\u201d Carrie Budoff Brown, senior vice president of politics at NBC News, said in a memo\u00a0to staff. McDaniel exited the RNC earlier this month after leading the organization since 2016. During her time as chair, McDaniel repeatedly attacked the press, which has become increasingly popular in Republican circles over the last several years as Donald Trump demonizes journalists and news institutions. McDaniel echoed many such attacks, labeling the press as \u201cfake news\u201d and calling the media \u201ccorrupt.\u201d At times, she even targeted NBC News\u00a0and MSNBC\u00a0with dishonest attacks. In 2019, for instance, McDaniel accused Richard Engel, NBC News\u2019 chief foreign correspondent, of \u201cactively cheering for an economic downturn.\u201d \u201cHow can NBC let him keep his job when he\u2019s made his bias so clear?\u201d McDaniel asked. McDaniel has a lengthier history attacking the progressive cable news channel MSNBC, which she will appear on in her new role. In recent years, she has repeatedly attacked the channel for \u201cspreading lies\u201d and blasted those she described as the network\u2019s \u201cprimetime propagandists.\u201d An NBC spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment about her attacks on the news media and NBC. In her role as RNC chief, McDaniel also fanned the flames of election denialism after the 2020 presidential contest. McDaniel was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d The Michigan Department of State\u2019s office condemned her claims of supposed voter fraud in the wake of the election, stating they had \u201cno merit.\u201d\u00a0The state\u2019s \u201celections were conducted fairly, effectively and transparently and are an accurate reflection of the will of Michigan voters,\u201d it said in a\u00a0detailed fact check\u00a0posted online. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Chris Wallace last year, McDaniel defended her claims of voting \u201cirregularity\u201d in the election. \u201cI think saying that there were problems with 2020 is very real. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s election denying,\u201d McDaniel told Wallace. \u201cI\u2019m from Wayne County. We had a woman send a note saying I\u2019m being told to backdate ballots. We had to look into that. That\u2019s deeply concerning. When you have friends who are poll-watching and being kicked out, that\u2019s deeply concerning. We have every right to look at that.\u201d In the interview,\u00a0Wallace pressed McDaniel if she believed Biden legitimately won the election. \u201cI think there were lots of problems with 2020. Ultimately, he won the election\u00a0but there were lots of problems with the 2020 election,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think he won it fair. I don\u2019t.

{"id": "2024_05_24_business_nissan-suv-driveway-explosion", "text": "In the early morning of May 14, Vicki Hill was startled awake by the sound of explosions outside her home in Bethesda, Maryland. The loud bangs, she learned later, had come from the airbags of the family\u2019s SUV, a 2015 Nissan Murano that was parked in the driveway. It was on fire. \u201cI thought someone was trying to get into our house with a sledgehammer and I woke my husband up and I said something\u2019s wrong,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cAnd he ran downstairs and shouted up, \u2018Call 911, the car\u2019s on fire!\u2019\u201d Video from the home\u2019s doorbell camera,\u00a0which the family provided to CNN,\u00a0shows smoke before the fire erupts and then\u00a0engulfs the car. The cause of the fire in the Murano remains unknown. The fire is\u00a0under investigation\u00a0by Nissan. The National Highway Traffic Administration is gathering information\u00a0on the fire, as well. \u201cThe safety and security of our customers is our primary concern,\u201d a Nissan spokesperson said in a statement in response to an email asking about the fire. \u201cWe have opened an investigation into this incident.\u201d The\u00a0Hills\u2019 Murano was recalled by Nissan\u00a0in 2016 and 2019, to fix a problem that could allow brake fluid to leak and start a fire, even while the vehicle is parked. At the time, owners were warned to park their vehicles outside and away from buildings until the issue was repaired because of fire risks. A search on NHTSA\u2019s website indicated there was an outstanding unrepaired recall on the Hills\u2019 Murano. The couple said a local fire investigator suggested the unrepaired recall could have caused the fire. But the Hills remember getting the work done and provided CNN with a photograph of the receipt from a local Nissan dealership that showed the repair was made. CNN has not confirmed whether the receipt is authentic. The Hills said that because the recall work had been done, the possibility of a fire wasn\u2019t something that crossed their minds. Philip Hill had been fixing the garage, so the couple\u2019s two cars were parked in the driveway. Otherwise, the Murano would have been parked inside the garage adjoining the house. \u201cAs you can see from the video, that vehicle is so close to the house,\u201d Philip Hill told CNN. \u201cMinutes later, the house could have gone up.\u201d As it was, the garage door melted from the flames, they said. The Hills credit a neighbor\u2019s dog with saving them and their three children. The neighbor was able to call 911 before the Hills, after being alerted by her dog. The intense flames from the burning Nissan also damaged the side of the family\u2019s other car, a 2012 Mercedes C-class, leaving it unusable. Initially, the Hills were concerned they might have been victims of vandalism. But\u00a0they said\u00a0the video footage from their Nest doorbell camera\u00a0clearly\u00a0showed the vehicle spontaneously combusting. Nissan took possession of the Murano on Wednesday to study it more closely, the Hills said. As surprising as the Hills\u2019 situation may seem, vehicle fires are not uncommon. In 2022, an estimated 188,500 car and truck fires blazed in the United States, an average of more than 500 a day, according to the National Fire Protection Association. Vehicle fires caused 610 civilian deaths that year, according the NFPA.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/business/nissan-suv-driveway-explosion/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_21_opinions_sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic", "text": "The biggest tech news this week is the\u00a0ouster\u00a0of Sam Altman from his role as CEO of OpenAI, a move that has shaken the company and the industry. Hundreds of OpenAI employees have threatened to\u00a0resign. Altman has already\u00a0moved on\u00a0to a role at Microsoft. And OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is on its\u00a0third CEO\u00a0in as many days. It\u2019s all very juicy. But this drama should also be raising larger questions, far beyond one company\u2019s internal hirings and firings, including: Who are the people making the decisions\u00a0that will determine so much of our technological future? What guiding principles are they using to make those decisions? And how should other institutions \u2013 governments, non-tech industries, global alliances, regulatory bodies \u2013 reign in the worst excesses of potentially dangerous AI innovators? OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, with an explicit mission to harness what may soon be superhuman intelligence \u201cto benefit humanity as a whole.\u201d But that sensibility hasn\u2019t lasted. The company now has a multi-billion-dollar for-profit arm. They have been developing new technologies at lightning speed, and sometimes sending them out to the public\u00a0before some employees believed they were ready. The company has already reportedly invented an AI technology so dangerous they will never release it \u2013 but they also\u00a0won\u2019t tell\u00a0reporters or the public exactly what it is. This dynamic \u2013 a potentially dangerous technology developed at extreme speed, largely behind closed doors \u2013 is partly to blame for Altman\u2019s firing. The OpenAI board, according to\u00a0CNN\u2019s David Goldman, worried that \u201cthe company was making the technological equivalent of a nuclear bomb, and its caretaker, Sam Altman, was moving so fast that he risked a global catastrophe.\u201d At particular issue seemed to be Altman\u2019s efforts to make the tools behind ChatGPT available to anyone who wanted to make their own version of the chatbot. This could be widely disastrous, some board members worried. But then they fired him without warning, and apparently without involving Microsoft, the company\u2019s largest shareholder. Now, Altman is at the new AI group at Microsoft, and one has to wonder if the oversight and caution there will be on par with that at OpenAI, or if he\u2019ll be handed carte blanche to push as fast and hard as he wants. And for all the justified reticence of the OpenAI board, the company has carried out much of its work in secrecy \u2013 without the public really understanding what a handful of unaccountable technologists are building, and how it is nearly guaranteed to indelibly change their lives. AI is broadly understood to have the potential to reshape vast swaths of human existence. At the very least, it seems nearly guaranteed to change how we process information, how we communicate, how we learn and how we work (and if we work). And the ramifications could be much more extreme. AI technologies have already demonstrated the ability\u00a0to lie and to cover their tracks. They have already been able to\u00a0suggest the design\u00a0to make a virus spread more quickly. Many researchers\u00a0acutely understand\u00a0just how quickly these machines could develop the capacity to annihilate us, including Altman: He has a prepper\u2019s paradise prepared in Big Sur, complete with guns and \u201cgas masks from the Israeli Defense Force\u201d in case AI goes off the rails and the robots go to war against humans,\u00a0according to reporting in the New Yorker. But don\u2019t worry, he told an Atlantic reporter: If AI is determined to wipe us out, \u201cno gas mask is helping anyone.\u201d (If you want an excellent and terrifying rundown of AI\u2019s risks \u2013 at least those we understand right now, which are almost certainly a mere sliver of the looming perils \u2013\u00a0the Atlantic profile of Altman and his technology\u00a0is worth a read). AI is very exciting technology. But it is also a potentially very dangerous one, and not in the social media sense of \u201cit may give us bad self-esteem and make us lonelier\u201d but in the sense of \u201cit could break down human societies and kill us all.\u201d Given the life-altering potential of AI \u2013 that even if it doesn\u2019t kill us all, it will almost certainly change human existence in unprecedented ways at unprecedented speed \u2013 we all have a stake in how it\u2019s being developed. And yet the development is being left to a handful of people (who seem to be\u00a0largely\u00a0men) in Silicon Valley, and other tech pockets around the globe. And we all have a stake in whose interests AI will serve \u2013 and right now, its development is being funded with billions of dollars by people expecting to make a huge profit. Do the interests of the public align with the interests of the shareholders to whom profit-driven, potentially tremendously lucrative-for-a-few companies are beholden? Or with the interests of tech entrepreneurs who are primarily excited about being at the forefront of the AI revolution, regardless of the potential human costs? One thing is clear: AI is coming. And how it is built and unleashed on the public matters more than perhaps any technology of the past century. It is, indeed, up there with the atom bomb in its destructive potential \u2013 except likely more difficult to regulate and control. \u201cRegulation\u201d does not begin to scratch the surface of what\u2019s needed to make sure that the AI future is not a catastrophic one, especially since the development of AI is now a massive international arms race, with particularly horrific implications if bad actors develop this technology first. But regulation is, at minimum, a necessary step. So is transparency: In the US, companies have wide leverage to work behind a veil of secrecy, and much of what AI companies do is kept secret to stymy competition. But the public certainly has a right to understand what life-altering technologies are set to be inflicted upon us, and what the creators are doing to protect humanity \u2013 our jobs, our communities, our families, our connections, our educations and our abilities to build a life of purpose, but also our lives and our safety. The Altman story is fascinating because Altman is the most powerful figure in AI technology, which in effect makes him one of the most powerful men in the world. But that should give us pause: Who is he, what power does he hold, what is he doing with it, who does he answer to, and are we comfortable with this much life-altering potential being held by a few unaccountable people?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/21/opinions/sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_business_a-popular-memorial-day-tradition-is-back-hot-deals-on-new-cars", "text": "Memorial Day weekend is shaping up to offer some of the best deals on new cars in years. The discounts vary widely by manufacturer and type of car \u2013 don\u2019t expect too much off on a Toyota SUV, for example. But it\u2019s a good time to be in the market for an electric vehicle. The new car market is finally a buyer\u2019s market again. For decades, the holiday weekend was a great time to buy a new car, with dealers competing to sell out the last of the previous year\u2019s models to make room for incoming new cars. It hasn\u2019t been that way for a while, though. Covid lockdowns disrupted parts supply chains for car factories, making new models often hard to find. It got so bad that, for a while,  almost all cars were routinely selling for above the manufacturers suggested retail price, or MSRP, something that\u2019s normally rare. Deep discounts? They were practically unheard of. Not this year. The auto industry is back pumping out new cars, and dealers are discounting again. Currently Ford dealers are offering average incentives of up to $1,556 on the Ford Bronco, more than six times what they were offering last year, according to data from Cox Automotive. On the GMC Sierra pickup, dealers are offering almost $6,000 on average in incentives, according to Cox. EVs are good buys right now. The Volkswagen ID.4 and Kia Niro EV, for instance, are selling at average discounts of more than 13%, according to Edmunds.com. Zero-percent financing deals for buyers with good credit have also become much more common this year than last, according to Edmunds.com. \u201cA lot more inventory\u2019s out there now,\u201d said Eric Barbosa, business leader for the Cavender Auto Group in San Antonio, Texas. \u201cI mean, we\u2019ve got to get rid of these cars.\u201d Making room for the 2025 models It\u2019s not just seasonal sales hype, industry experts say. Dealers really are negotiating deeper discounts than they have in the last few years because they need the space. Overall, new vehicle inventory at dealers is the highest it\u2019s been since late in 2020, according to Cox Automotive. The average discount on a 2023 model year vehicle these days is $4,127, according to Edmunds, which is much deeper than discounts on leftover prior-year models for the last few years. Newer 2024 model year vehicles are selling at an average discount of $1,741. \u201cThere\u2019s a big push to get these \u201923s out and make room for the \u201824s and \u201825s,\u201d said Barbosa. There are more of these prior-year models, meaning 2023 model year vehicles, left than there were this time last year. Vehicles from the outgoing 2023 model year now account for 6.8% of all new vehicles on dealers\u2019 lots, according to Edmunds.com. That\u2019s higher than the percentage of 2022 model year vehicles available around this time last year, and it\u2019s much higher than the 3.7% that were 2021 model year vehicles left for sale this late in 2022. Where are the biggest deals and risks? Bulging vehicle inventories are not evenly distributed, though. Dealerships for some manufacturers have many more unsold vehicles than others. Dealers for Stellantis brands \u2013 Dodge, Chrysler, Jeep and Ram \u2013 are offering the biggest discounts, according to Edmunds.com. These brands are usually sold together in combined dealerships. Dodge is offering some of the biggest discounts in the industry, averaging more than $6,700 per vehicle, according to Edmunds. Chrysler vehicles are selling for an average discount of more than $6,200, while Jeeps are selling at an average of $6,000 off sticker price. Since these figures are averages, that means that not every model in every place will be discounted that much, of course, while some will be discounted more. Here\u2019s one big caveat. A model year may seem like just a number, but shoppers should research carefully to make sure that last year\u2019s model isn\u2019t missing features and improvements introduced on the 2024 version. For example, if you\u2019re considering the Lincoln Nautilus SUV, the 2024 model is entirely redesigned with lots of improvements including a big interior screen and customizable \u201cdigital scenting\u201d to make the cabin smell nice. Also, when it comes time to trade in, the 2023 could be worth less than a 2024 model. \u201cConsumers who prefer to swap their vehicles every few years may want to look elsewhere as these new outgoing models experience heavier immediate depreciation compared to new vehicles from the current model year,\u201d said Edmunds industry analyst Ivan Drury in an email. And not all dealers are offering exciting sales. \u201cToyota, Honda and Kia, there is still so much pent-up demand for these brands, inventory is tight, and sell-through rates are high,\u201d said Brian Finkelmeyer, an industry analyst with Cox Automotive. So you\u2019re unlikely to find big discounts on those vehicles. It will also depend on the type of vehicle you\u2019re looking for, experts say. \u201cThe deals are likely to be had on slower-selling models, specifically sedans and hatchbacks,\u201d said Brian Moody, an industry analyst with Autotrader and Kelley Blue Book. \u201cWith compact SUVs selling in higher and higher volumes each year, don\u2019t bother.\u00a0You will likely be paying full sticker price.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/business/a-popular-memorial-day-tradition-is-back-hot-deals-on-new-cars/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "business"}}

It is discounting thousands of grocery items in a bid to entice price-conscious shoppers to add a little bit more to their shopping carts. The online grocery delivery service, which also operates a handful of physical stores, said its shoppers in the United States will see discounts every day of up to 30% on 4,000 items in-store and online, and those markdowns will rotate weekly. A number of big retailers in recent weeks, including Target and Walmart, have lowered their prices as they strive to pull consumers into stores and online to spend more freely on both essential purchases such as food and more discretionary purchases like new clothes, decorative items for the home, arts and\u00a0crafts or hobby kits. Retailers are feeling jittery after they jacked up prices as inflation spiked in recent years. But now, households aren\u2019t shopping like they used to, and high prices are forcing Americans to choose between wants and needs. In the game of chicken between stores and shoppers, it\u2019s the stores that finally appear to be yielding. That\u2019s a problem not just for individual shoppers or even big retail chains but for the whole American economy, of which about two-thirds comes from consumer spending. Shoppers have pulled back for a year now as costs have risen 20% to 30% higher than they were three years ago and as incomes failed to keep up, said Sarah Wyeth, managing director, retail and consumer with S&P Global Ratings. This is making consumers across income levels look for deals. \u201cThere\u2019s just less dollars for consumers to spend,\u201d Wyeth said. The challenge for retailers now is to shake consumers out of that frugal mindset, she added. What\u2019s getting cheaper on Amazon Fresh The price cuts include meat, seafood, frozen food, dairy and cheese, beverages, snacks and pastas, the retailer told CNN Friday. The discounted food items will include national brands and Amazon\u2019s (AMZN) private label products. \u201cIncreasing our weekly deals across thousands of items and expanding the reach of Prime Savings at Amazon Fresh is just one way that we\u2019re continuing to invest in competitive pricing and savings for all of our customers \u2013 both in-store and online,\u201d Claire Peters, worldwide vice president with Amazon Fresh, said in a statement. For Prime members, Amazon Fresh is stacking more savings by offering a 10% discount on hundreds of online grocery items. Competitors are cutting, too Target\u00a0this week slashed prices on more than 1,500 popular items, ranging from butter to laundry detergent, in its attempt to pull in more shoppers. It said Target (TGT) shoppers can expect \u201cthousands more price cuts\u201d \u2014 amounting to 5,000 items \u2014 being reduced over the summer and that its lower prices aim \u201ccollectively save consumers millions of dollars\u201d on household staples and everyday items such as milk, fresh fruit, diapers and even pet food.

EV sales in the US grew 2.6 % in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, according to Kelley Blue Book. First quarter EV sales last year had outpaced 2022\u2019s by a stunning 46.4%. Many in the industry had expected interest in EVs to accelerate, not slow down. But consumers are concerned about the high prices of EVs and worried about being able to charge them easily, according to the consumer survey company JD Power. These concerns have led to recent drops in customer consideration of EVs. Currently, Nissan sells two EV models in the US, the Leaf compact hatchback and the Ariya SUV, but had announced plans to build five new EV models in Canton including two originally scheduled for production in 2025. The new models were set to include both Nissan and Infiniti vehicles. Infiniti is Nissan\u2019s luxury brand. Nissan is delaying plans to actually begin producing the vehicles in Mississippi. \u201cWe are adjusting the timeline for the introduction of these five new models to ensure we bring the vehicles to the market at the right time, prioritizing in line with customer demand and maximizing the opportunity for our brands and supplier partners,\u201d Nissan said in a statement emailed to CNN. These latest delays were previously reported by the industry newspaper Automotive News. Nissan still plans to offer a total of 19 EV models globally by 2030, a spokesperson said. Nissan previously announced it would invest $500 million in the factory to prepare it build the new electric vehicles. The factory in Canton currently employs roughly 5,000 workers and makes the Nissan Altima sedan Frontier, Titan, and Titan XD pickups.  Other automakers have also made moves to slow production of new EVs and EV batteries citing concerns about slowing consumer adoption.

But just days after the launch, the company is already walking back some factually incorrect results. Google earlier this month introduced an AI-generated search results overview tool, which summarizes search results so that users don\u2019t have to click through multiple links to get quick answers to their questions. But the feature came under fire this week after it provided false or misleading information to some users\u2019 questions. For example, several users posted on X that Google\u2019s AI summary said that former President Barack Obama is a Muslim, a common misconception. In fact, Obama is a Christian. Another user posted that a Google AI summary said that \u201cnone of Africa\u2019s 54 recognized countries start with the letter \u2018K\u2019\u201d \u2014 clearly forgetting Kenya. Google confirmed to CNN on Friday that the AI overviews for both queries had been removed for violating the company\u2019s policies. \u201cThe vast majority of AI Overviews provide high quality information, with links to dig deeper on the web,\u201d Google spokesperson Colette Garcia said in a statement, adding that some other viral examples of Google AI flubs appear to have been manipulated images. \u201cWe conducted extensive testing before launching this new experience, and as with other features we\u2019ve launched in Search, we appreciate the feedback. We\u2019re taking swift action where appropriate under our content policies.\u201d The bottom of each Google AI search overview acknowledges that \u201cgenerative AI is experimental.\u201d And the company says it conducts testing designed to imitate potential bad actors in an effort to prevent false or low-quality results from showing up in AI summaries. Google\u2019s search overviews are part of the company\u2019s larger push to incorporate its Gemini AI technology across all of its products as it attempts to keep up in the AI arms race with rivals like OpenAI and Meta. But this week\u2019s debacle shows the risk that adding AI \u2013 which has a tendency to confidently state false information \u2013 could undermine Google\u2019s reputation as the trusted source to search for information online. Even on less serious searches, Google\u2019s AI overview appears to sometimes provide wrong or confusing information. In one test, CNN asked Google, \u201chow much sodium is in pickle juice.\u201d The AI overview responded that an 8 fluid ounce-serving of pickle juice contains 342 milligrams of sodium but that a serving less than half the size (3 fluid ounces) contained more than double the sodium (690 milligrams). (Best Maid pickle juice, for sale at Walmart, lists 250 milligrams of sodium in just 1 ounce.)

It\u2019s not the first time Google has had to walk back the capabilities of its AI tools over an embarrassing flub.

Now, the West is trying to turn that trickle of cash into a flood. Finance officials from the G7 economies met in Stresa, Italy to discuss\u00a0new ways of using the proceeds from some \u20ac260 billion ($282 billion) of Russia\u2019s foreign currency reserves that were frozen by Western countries after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. \u201cProgress has been made \u2026 as far as the main issues are concerned,\u201d Italian Economy Minister\u00a0Giancarlo\u00a0Giorgetti\u00a0said Saturday during a press conference after the meeting, adding that there are some legal technical issues that still have to be resolved.

The plan \u201cwould essentially bring forward that flow of interest proceeds from the assets\u2026 (through a loan) given to Ukraine,\u201d Yellen told broadcaster Sky News in an interview this week. \u201cUkraine has substantial needs, and being able to marshal significant resources to help Ukraine is important,\u201d she said. G7 finance ministers hope to agree on a way forward that can be signed off when President Joe Biden and other leaders meet for a summit in Italy next month. The plan stops short of seizing the assets outright. The EU is worried that such a move would discourage other countries from keeping their assets in the bloc. Most of the frozen Russian money is held in Europe, and the euro is the world\u2019s second-most important currency after the US dollar. The proposal \u201cis a halfway house to full seizure,\u201d Lee Buccheit, a veteran sovereign debt expert and honorary professor at the University of Edinburgh Law School, told CNN. From $3 billion to $50 billion? Around two-thirds of Russia\u2019s immobilized assets, or some \u20ac210 billion ($228 billion), sits in the EU, mostly at Euroclear, a Belgium-based financial institution that keeps assets safe for banks, exchanges and investors. Following months of discussions, the EU formally adopted an agreement Tuesday that taps the windfall profits Euroclear makes by reinvesting the cash generated by those assets \u2014 such as coupon payments on bonds. Western sanctions mean coupon payments and maturing assets cannot be sent to Russia. Under the EU agreement, between \u20ac2.5 and \u20ac3 billion ($2.7-3.3 billion) of these profits will be sent annually to Kyiv. The first payment will be made in July, with 90% earmarked for arms and military equipment. The split of funds will be reviewed each year starting in January 2025, with the option to shift spending toward rebuilding Ukraine\u2019s war-torn economy as its needs change. \u201cThe EU has chosen a way forward that is legally sound, and flexible so that support can adjust to Ukraine\u2019s most pressing needs,\u201d European Commissioner for Trade Valdis Dombrovskis said in a statement Tuesday. Unlike the drip feed of funding agreed by the EU, the proposal under discussion by the G7 could deliver a much bigger lump sum, immediately.  Reuters reported Yellen as saying Thursday that a figure of $50 billion had been discussed by G7 ministers but there was no agreement yet on how big the collateralized loan should be. An even bigger check? Apart from seizing the stash of assets, or lending Kyiv money backed by the interest they earn, there\u2019s a third option the West might consider \u2014 a so-called reparations loan. Under this approach, Ukraine would borrow money from a syndicate of allies, including G7 members, and pledge as collateral its claim for reparations \u2014 or compensation \u2014 against Russia. This would give Kyiv access to a much larger amount of money than using future or current windfall profits from Russian assets. \u201cUkraine has a claim against Russia for reparations \u2014 legally, that is indubitable \u2014 and it would in effect be monetizing a portion of that claim by pledging it to secure this loan from the G7,\u201d Buchheit, the debt expert, said. If Russia failed to pay reparations, then the G7 would be in a position to draw on the pool of frozen assets to recover the value of its loan to Ukraine, he added. This mechanism also ensures that Russia foots part of the colossal bill for rebuilding Ukraine, which the World Bank has put at $486 billion over the next decade. \u201cShort of a regime change in Russia, Putin is never going to pay reparations,\u201d said Buccheit. \u201cThis $300 billion is probably the only contribution Russia will ever make for paying reparations for what it has done to Ukraine.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/business/russian-frozen-assets-g7-ukraine/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_tech_meta-amazon-ai-fears-eu-law", "text": "Amazon and Meta executives told CNN this week that some of the fears about artificial intelligence are overblown and that the European Union\u2019s sweeping new AI rules risk holding back innovation. The EU gave the final green light to its AI act Tuesday, the same week tech leaders gathered in Paris for the annual VivaTech conference. The first-of-its-kind law is poised to reshape how firms and other organizations in Europe use AI for everything from health care decisions to policing. It imposes blanket bans on using the technology in ways deemed \u201cunacceptable\u201d \u2014 for example, for social scoring. The regulation also creates new disclosure obligations for large AI companies and requires more transparency on uses of AI considered \u201chigh-risk,\u201d such as for education and hiring. For Meta\u2019s (META) AI chief, Yann LeCun, \u201cthe big question\u201d about the new law is \u201cshould research and development in AI be regulated?\u201d \u201cThere are clauses in the EU AI act and various other places that do regulate research and development. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Anna Stewart at the Paris event. LeCun, widely known as one of the \u201cgodfathers of AI,\u201d disagrees with concerns that AI could soon surpass human intelligence. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it\u2019s anywhere close,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s that dangerous, frankly, certainly not today.\u201d AI systems might become a lot smarter in the future but then they will be designed with appropriate safeguards, he added. \u201cBut today, trying to figure out how to make future super-intelligent AI systems safe is like asking in 1925 \u2018how do we make jet transport safe?\u2019 And jet transport was not invented yet,\u201d he said. Amazon\u2019s (AMZN) chief technology officer Werner Vogels echoed concerns that AI regulation could stifle innovation in some areas. When thinking about risks, regulators should consider the application of the new technology to, for instance, health care and financial services differently from its use to summarize meetings, he told Stewart. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole range of areas where I think the risks are minimal and we should let innovation run there,\u201d he said. In other areas, where mistakes can have a bigger impact on people\u2019s lives, risks should be managed \u201cuniquely for that particular area.\u201d Vogels stressed that Amazon welcomes regulation, and is aligned with regulators in their overall goals, but warned the EU against overregulating AI, pointing to the example of its signature data privacy law, known as GDPR, which he described as a very \u201cthick\u201d book. \u201cLet\u2019s make sure that the regulatory requirements that we put in place, companies \u2014 not just the largest company but every company in Europe \u2014 can actually implement,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to make sure that innovation continues to happen and that the innovation doesn\u2019t just come outside Europe. We already have a very long history in Europe of underinvesting in R&D,\u201d he added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/tech/meta-amazon-ai-fears-eu-law/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2022_04_27_business_diamonds-manmade-demand", "text": "It\u2019s proposal season, and engagements are on the rise. So are factory-made diamond sales. Not that you\u2019d know the difference. Man-made diamonds look the same as naturally occurring ones. The only noticeable difference is the price tag. \u201cThe result is really stunning,\u201d said Edahn Golan, an independent diamond industry analyst. He said March data showed the number of engagement rings sold that featured a manufactured diamond jumped 63% compared to last year, while the number of engagement rings sold with a natural diamond declined 25% in the same period. Going back by another month, to February, the data showed the number of rings sold with lab diamonds that month surged even more, to 80% compared to a year earlier while the number fell by 13% for natural diamond engagement rings.  \u201cThe big fear in the natural diamonds industry is that consumers will start accepting lab-grown diamonds in engagement rings,\u201d he said. Too late. \u201cIt\u2019s actually happening.\u201d  Tide is shifting Why are consumers flocking to man-made diamonds? Cost is the most obvious reason. The average retail price of the most popular one carat round man-made diamond for an engagement ring in March was $2,318, Golan said. \u201cThis is substantially less \u2013 as much as 73% cheaper \u2013 than a natural diamond of the same size, cut and clarity as the man-made diamond, which would cost $8,740,\u201d he said. Plus, the lower cost allows couples to buy a bigger stone.  \u201cA lab diamond is a real diamond, but maybe it took a few weeks to make it,\u201d said Golan. \u201cNatural diamonds were formed over 800 million to three billion years and there isn\u2019t an infinite supply of them.\u201d  This makes natural diamonds quite a bit more expensive, and prices are likely to rise as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has tightened the supply chain for natural raw diamonds. The sanctions directly target Alrosa, partly owned by the Russian government, which the US government identified as the world\u2019s largest diamond mining company, accounting for 28% of global diamond output. Man-made diamonds are also becoming popular as consumers are more aware and educated about them, said Dan Moran, a third-generation diamond expert and owner of LA-based fine jeweler Concierge Diamonds. Moran said the typical buyer of man-made diamonds is typically younger than 40 and very budget conscious. Mined diamonds have a controversial history that\u2019s tied to the use of child labor in some African diamond mines as well as sales of illegally-traded \u201cconflict diamonds\u201d that fund conflict in war-torn areas. Among Millennials and Gen Z, their eco-conscious mindset and ethical concerns about natural diamond sourcing is another factor influencing their preference for non-traditional engagement rings, according to a report from wedding planning website The Knot. Small but growing share of the diamond market Although its slice is growing, the market share for man-made diamonds remains relatively small. Currently, about 7% of the specialty diamond jewelry market is represented by man-made diamonds, up from 3% in 2020, said Golan.  Some major jewelry retailers are driving the effort to take man-made diamonds mainstream. In 2021, the world\u2019s largest jewelry company, Pandora\n            \n                (PANDY), made a major shift by announcing it would stop using mined diamonds and would swap to lab-created diamonds in its jewelry.  Pandora said it\u2019s instituting the change as part of an effort to sell sustainable jewelry, and also because consumers increasingly are asking for it. Signet,\n            \n                (SIG) the largest jewelry company in the United States (which owns Zales, Kay Jewelers and Jared chains) called out the popularity of lab diamond jewelry in its March earnings call with analysts. Calling it a \u201cfast-growing category\u201d in its jewelry portfolio, Signet CEO Virginia Drosos told analysts that lab-created diamonds are among the big jewelry trends she expects this year.  The company said it has expanded its man-made bridal jewelry selection in both its Zales and Kay Jewelers stores in response to the increased demand.  Fine jewelry brand Charles and Colvard, which makes lab-created diamonds, said consumers don\u2019t just want to look good with the jewelry they are wearing, they also want to feel good about it. \u201cAs the momentum for conscious consumerism grows, the surge towards lab grown diamonds isn\u2019t surprising,\u201d said Don O\u2019Connell, president and CEO of Charles & Colvard. \u201c[Consumers] want to know the origins of their stones and be reassured they\u2019re conflict-free. They\u2019re embracing the choice to purchase a piece of fine jewelry that aligns with their values.\u201d Lab-grown diamond brand VRAI said the pandemic, too, has sparked attention and action toward social and environmental issues. It said consumers are being more thoughtful and reassessing their purchasing habits, as well as the companies and industries they are supporting. There is, however, one important consideration for anyone buying lab-created diamonds: Man-made diamonds have little resale value.  So while you may not be able to tell a natural diamond from a factory made variety, someone with a trained eye can, said Golan. Once a stone is identified as a factory diamond, even though you paid a lot less for it, you also won\u2019t get much for it.  But the value of a ring isn\u2019t just monetary. \u201cAs a professional in the industry, I am asked all the time by people about what I think about a ring they have,\u201d said Moran, of Concierge Jewelers. \u201cI always say, if you love it, be happy with it. An engagement ring is a symbol of commitment and enduring love.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/27/business/diamonds-manmade-demand/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk", "text": "In a year of wild tech stories that has seen Elon Musk transform Twitter, cryptocurrency exchange FTX collapse and Silicon Valley Bank implode, this week\u2019s whiplash-inducing turmoil at OpenAI is among the most captivating. Sam Altman \u2014 the leader of one of the world\u2019s most influential AI companies, OpenAI, and perhaps the\u00a0most visible figure in the fledgling industry \u2014 was fired Friday night by the startup\u2019s directors in a surprise move. Less than five days later, he\u2019s back as the company\u2019s CEO, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. The series of extraordinary events unfolded just days after OpenAI held its\u00a0first-ever developer conference, where it laid out new, commercialized versions of its technology, including the option to customize its ChatGPT AI chatbot. If you\u2019re just catching up, here\u2019s what you missed from a week so incredible you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking the script could have been written by an early version of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Friday Around 3 p.m. ET, Altman joined a Google Meet call with most of OpenAI\u2019s board that had been convened by fellow co-founder and OpenAI chief scientist\u00a0Ilya Sutskever, during which Altman was fired and told that the news would soon be made public. Within the next half hour, the board also informed Greg Brockman, another co-founder and OpenAI president, that he would be removed from the board. Around 3:30 p.m. ET, OpenAI publicly announced that it had fired Altman over concerns that he was not always truthful with the board. The board said Mira Murati, the company\u2019s chief technology officer, would become interim CEO. OpenAI\u2019s strategic partners, including its biggest financial backer Microsoft, were also reportedly informed of Altman\u2019s ouster just minutes before the board\u2019s announcement. Hours after being fired, Altman posted on X that he \u201cloved working with such talented people\u201d and that he would have \u201cmore to say about what\u2019s next later.\u201d Brockman promptly quit. \u201cPlease don\u2019t spend any time being concerned. We will be fine,\u201d Brockman\u00a0said in a Friday post\u00a0on X. \u201cGreater things coming soon.\u201d A key factor in the CEO\u2019s firing was\u00a0tension between Altman, who favored developing AI\u00a0more aggressively, and members of the OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the unfolding events. Saturday Within 24 hours of Altman being fired, reports emerged that he and other ex-OpenAI loyalists were mulling plans for their own venture. OpenAI\u2019s board was also reportedly having second thoughts and considering asking the ousted CEO to return. Sunday By Sunday afternoon, Altman was\u00a0back at OpenAI\u2019s headquarters\u00a0\u2014 this time with a guest badge \u2014 to negotiate his potential return. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reportedly mediated the discussion. A 5 p.m. PT deadline was reportedly set for the board to agree to Altman\u2019s demands, including adding a seat for Microsoft, and reinstating him as CEO. But those talks broke down. As Sunday turned into Monday, Nadella tweeted that Altman, along with Brockman, would join Microsoft to run a new AI research group. At OpenAI, the group found a new interim CEO: Emmett Shear, the former CEO of Amazon\u2019s streaming service, Twitch. Murati would return to her role as OpenAI\u2019s chief technology officer. Monday In a post on X early Monday, Shear, who left his role at Twitch in March, described the chance to join OpenAI as \u201ca once-in-a-lifetime\u201d opportunity. He added that the company would hire an independent investigator to report on what happened in the lead-up to Altman\u2019s firing. But OpenAI employees were not convinced. More than 500 staffers signed an open letter calling on the company\u2019s board to resign and reinstate Altman and Brockman. They also threatened to follow the co-founders to Microsoft if their demands were not met. Altman posted on X, saying, \u201cwe have more unity and commitment and focus than ever before. we are all going to work together some way or other, and i\u2019m so excited. one team, one mission.\u201d The drama was far from over.\u00a0The Verge reported Monday afternoon\u00a0that Altman and Brockman could still return to OpenAI if the board members who fired him resign. And Nadella, speaking to CNBC, said he was \u201copen to both options\u201d when asked whether Altman would actually join Microsoft. \u201cLook, that is for the OpenAI board and management and the employees to choose,\u201d Nadella said. \u201cWe chose to explicitly partner with OpenAI and we want to continue to do so, and obviously, that depends on the people of OpenAI staying there or coming to Microsoft.\u201d Tuesday Altman\u00a0was reinstated late Tuesday as OpenAI\u2019s CEO, the company said on X. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman\u00a0wrote\u00a0that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his\u00a0post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it has backed with billions to bolster its ambitions in developing AI. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Nadella\u00a0said\u00a0on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "business"}}

You can sign up\u00a0right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link. Buying or selling a stock is about to get a lot snappier starting next Tuesday. But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019ll get smoother, at least right away \u2014 and some financial firms are preparing to handle any possible bumpiness. The current standard settlement cycle for broker-dealer transactions is \u201cT+2.\u201d That means that it takes two business days from when you buy a stock to when that transaction \u201csettles,\u201d or when the stock is officially transferred to the buyer\u2019s account and cash is delivered to the seller\u2019s account. That\u2019s been the norm since 2017. Starting May 28, that cycle will take just one business day, or \u201cT+1.\u201d \u201cFor everyday investors who sell their stock on a Monday, shortening the settlement cycle will allow them to get their money on Tuesday,\u201d Gary Gensler, chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said in a press release. \u201cIt will make our market plumbing more resilient, timely and orderly.\u201d These new rules will apply to stocks, bonds, municipal securities, exchange-traded funds, some mutual funds and limited partnerships that trade on an exchange. Broker-dealers and registered investment advisors will also have to follow new recordkeeping rules. Some investors say that a shorter cycle should help free up more liquidity in the market and reduce volatility in margins \u2014 the collateral traders have to show \u2014 since it reduces the chance of default before the transaction goes through. Clearinghouses, which sit between buyers and sellers, collect margins from traders as evidence that they can afford to make the transaction. \u201cAssuming everything goes well and we don\u2019t see any hiccups, the move towards T+1 will be an overall benefit to our ecosystem, institutional investors and retail [investors],\u201d said Rich Lee, head of program trading and execution strategy at Baird. Baird has had a T+1 committee in place since last summer to ensure such hiccups don\u2019t happen, Lee said. Employees have been in discussions with clients about how to assist them through the process. The company has also staffed up to handle their part in clearing trades with a shorter time frame. The shortened settlement cycle is partly in response to the 2021 meme stock frenzy, when investors on Reddit sent shares of GameStop and AMC Entertainment soaring to eye-popping heights in a short span of time. (Meme stocks typically trade less on fundamentals and more on social media frenzy.)  Robinhood in 2021 temporarily suspended trading of GameStop, AMC and other stocks on its platform, blaming in part the T+2 rule that pushed up collateral requirements imposed on brokers like Robinhood. Investors were left waiting for their trades and brokers with their cash locked up until the settlement, unable to allow more purchasing to ensure they had enough funds to cover the trades. \u201cThe existing two-day period to settle trades exposes investors and the industry to unnecessary risk and is ripe for change,\u201d Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev said in a February 2021 release. \u201cThere is no reason why the greatest financial system the world has ever seen cannot settle trades in real time.\u201d Boeing on track to meet FAA deadline to present quality control fixes Boeing will present its plan to fix quality problems with its assembly line to US regulators next week, the company said Thursday. The plan was ordered up by the Federal Aviation Administration in late February after a hole blew open in the side of an airborne 737 Max a month earlier, reports my colleague Gregory Wallace. The FAA said it audited the production line at Boeing and its key 737 Max supplier and found \u201cmultiple instances where the companies allegedly failed to comply with manufacturing quality control requirements.\u201d It gave Boeing 90 days to present a plan \u2014 and that deadline is next week. Boeing chief financial officer Brian West said Thursday that Boeing and the FAA have had \u201clots of dialogue\u201d including two check-ins during the preparation of the plan. \u201cThe engagement is constructive,\u201d he said at a conference organized by Wolfe Research on Thursday. \u201cI expect next week we\u2019re going to get some good feedback.\u201d FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker said separately on Thursday that the plan is \u201cnot the end of the process, it\u2019s the beginning.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a long road to get back to where they need to be making safe airplanes,\u201d Whitaker said in an interview on ABC News.

Meta created an AI advisory council that\u2019s composed entirely of White men Meta this week appointed a group of outside advisors to provide guidance on its artificial intelligence strategy. The four-person advisory group is composed entirely of White men, reports my colleague Clare Duffy. The tech giant said the group, which includes tech entrepreneurs and investors, will periodically consult with Meta\u2019s management \u201con strategic opportunities related to our technology and product roadmap.\u201d The move comes as Meta plans to invest tens of billions of dollars this year in AI infrastructure, research and product development. The council includes Patrick Collison, the co-founder and chief executive of financial technology company Stripe; Nat Friedman, the tech investor and former CEO of GitHub; Tobi L\u00fctke, the founder and CEO of online shopping firm Shopify; and Charlie Songhurst, the tech investor who formerly led corporate strategy and drove several key acquisitions at Microsoft. A Meta spokesperson confirmed the group will not be paid. Despite the group\u2019s significant combined experience, Meta is already taking heat for failing to include women or people of color \u2014 or anyone else outside of the wealthy, White, male, Silicon Valley mold \u2014 in a group advising one of the world\u2019s most powerful tech companies on a revolutionary new technology. The members of the group are also all in their 30s or 40s. The situation mirrors an incident last year at OpenAI when, in the wake of a leadership shakeup, it came under fire for appointing a board composed entirely of White men.

{"id": "2024_05_21_tech_microsoft-ai-copilot-plus-build-2024", "text": "Microsoft\u00a0jumped headfirst into building artificial intelligence directly into its Windows operating system on Monday, announcing new AI computers that could help ramp up flagging PC sales. The developments push the company closer to its long-time goal to \u201cbuild computers that understand us versus us having to understand computers,\u201d CEO Satya Nadella told the audience at the company\u2019s annual developer conference at its Redmond, Washington headquarters. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re really close to that real breakthrough,\u201d he added. The computers, which are packed with processors that power advanced AI tools, come as PC sales have stalled for years. The company hopes the new machines will boost sales and revive excitement, particularly as AI is expected to become increasingly part of everyday life. Microsoft\u2019s new lineup of Copilot+ PCs, which feature a new Surface Pro tablet and Surface laptop, include AI tools that don\u2019t require internet connection \u2013 the AI processing occurs directly on the device The new hardware runs on OpenAI\u2019s new GPT-4o technology, which aims to turn ChatGPT into a digital personal assistant that can engage in real-time, spoken conversations and interact using text and \u201cvision.\u201d Announced last week, it can view screenshots, photos, documents or charts uploaded by users and have a conversation about them. The new hardware also plays up Microsoft\u2019s existing AI assistant called Copilot, which works across various products, including Bing and Microsoft 365. It can help with tasks such as writing, keeping track of\u00a0emails in Outlook or designing\u00a0presentations in PowerPoint. One new feature, called Recall, acts as a personal \u201ctime machine,\u201d allowing users to quickly find things from their computer, such as documents, images and websites. Another allows for real-time translation into more than 40 more languages locally on the device. The company also showed off a new tool called Team Copilot, which serves as a personal assistant, allowing it act as a meeting facilitator to create agendas or take notes on behalf of the whole team, not just an individual user. Microsoft isn\u2019t alone in its AI PC ambition. Dell and Lenovo also recently debuted AI-first PC computers under the Copilot+ AI umbrella, an emerging category that experts widely believe will become the next stage of computing. (Copilot+ is the name of the line of hardware that supports the Copilot software.) Next month, Apple is expected to announce new AI-powered tools for the iPhone and Mac at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference. \u201cOver time, AI capability will become a ubiquitous feature, but Microsoft and its partners have made a solid start,\u201d Geoff Blaber, CEO at CCS Insight, told CNN. \u201cThey will need to work hard to ensure that AI becomes a lot more than just a meaningless descriptor with a growing number of features.\u201d Microsoft\u2019s advancements also come at a time when the PC market is ripe for innovation. \u201cThis is a much-needed catalyst,\u201d Blaber added. Although the Surface line is relatively small within the overall PC market, it serves as an aspirational brand and a frontrunner in terms of innovation, according to Jitesh Ubrani, a research manager at market research firm IDC. But Microsoft\u2019s move is more reflective of a greater shift happening in the industry toward AI. In June, Apple will likely introduce generative AI \u2013 artificial intelligence that is capable of creating new output from images to text \u2013 across its iOS and Mac platforms. Reports indicate the company could unveil an AI-powered chatbot that runs on OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT technology, the same technology that underpins Microsoft\u2019s new CoPilot+ line. Still, Microsoft has already established itself as an early leader in this space with ChatGPT integrated into key products. And it appears those efforts are paying off. Last month, Microsoft reported quarterly profits of $21.9 billion, up from $18.3 billion a year ago. Revenue grew 17% year-over-year growth to $61.9 billion. Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud business also experienced strong growth \u2013 revenue grew 31% \u2013 boosted by AI tailwinds. The company continues to go all in on AI in other ways, too. Earlier this month, Microsoft said it is pouring $3.3 billion into building a data hub in Wisconsin to train employees and manufacturers on how to best use artificial intelligence. The new center aims to create 2,300 union construction jobs and 2,000 permanent jobs over time, according to Microsoft. It also plans to use the center to train about 100,000 workers across the state.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/tech/microsoft-ai-copilot-plus-build-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_03_12_success_equal-pay-day-2024", "text": "March 12 marks Equal Pay Day in the United States, a symbolic date representing the number of days women have to work into the current year just to make the same amount of money men made in the prior one. Put another way, to make 12 months\u2019 worth of a man\u2019s median wages, a woman has to work about 14.5 months. In dollars and cents, for every dollar a man earns, a woman is paid 84 cents, according to the National Committee on Pay Equity and the Equal Pay Today campaign. That\u2019s based on earnings data for full-time, year-round workers from the US Census in 2022, which was the most recent full-year data set available. If part-time workers and those not employed year-round are included, the gender pay gap is worse, at 78 cents on the dollar, said Deborah Vagins, national campaign director of Equal Rights Advocates and director of Equal Pay Today. The size of the actual wage gap between men and women will widen or narrow depending on age, level of education, choice of occupation and tenure, as well as race and ethnicity. The gender pay gap is typically widest when comparing the earnings of White men to Black, Hispanic or Native American women. And, generally speaking, the gap is narrower in a given job when men and women are in their early- to mid-20s (i.e., when they are new to the workforce and before children come along), and also when comparing wages by title, tenure and education level within a given field. But no matter how you slice and dice the data, there are very few scenarios in which women on average earn the same as men. Indeed, in its latest analysis of median weekly earnings last year by occupation, the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research found that women earned less than men not only in all 20 of the largest occupations for men but also in all 20 of the largest occupations for women. Among the largest occupations for women, the most egregious pay gaps were among financial managers (women earned 71% of every dollar a man earns), retail salesperson (72%), education and child care administrators (79%), administrative assistants (80%) and managers (81%). The narrowest gap was among cashiers, where women almost have pay parity (98%) with their male colleagues. Same old (and annoying) story every year While the overall gender pay gap has been narrowing over time \u2014 for example, Equal Pay Day in 2005 was April 19, a full five weeks later than this year\u2019s \u2014 the very fact that \ufeffsuch a gap exists at all in 2024 is a reminder that employers and society still have work to do in recognizing the value of women\u2019s contributions at work. \u201cThe gender wage gap is a national disgrace,\u201d said\u00a0Jamila Taylor, IWPR\u2019s president and CEO, in a statement. \u201cEven in professions typically dominated by women, men earn more for doing the same job. Equal pay for equal work has been the law of the land for more than a half-century, yet\u00a0women still cannot get fair treatment when it comes to employment and earnings. And it\u2019s worse for women of color, who face rampant racial discrimination in the workforce in addition to ongoing pay inequities.\u201d The good news is that there are now multiple efforts that may over time help reduce the problem. They include an increasing number of state-level pay transparency laws and bans on employers asking job candidates for their salary histories, which can help chronically underpaid women gain more of an equal footing when they apply for new jobs. There is also now a ban on federal government agencies asking job candidates\u2019 for their salary history and a proposed rule that would prohibit federal contractors from doing the same, as well as requiring them to post in their job ads the pay for given positions. But Vagins and others in the campaign for equal pay also want to see action at the federal legislative level, supporting two bills: the Salary Transparency Act and the Paycheck Fairness Act, which have been introduced in the US House and Senate multiple times. For instance, the Paycheck Fairness Act would, according to Equal Pay Today, \u201cbar retaliation against workers who voluntarily discuss or disclose their wages; close loopholes that have allowed employers to pay women less than men for the same work \u2026 [and] ensure women can receive the same robust remedies for sex-based pay discrimination that are currently available to those subjected to discrimination based on race and ethnicity.\u201d Absent such federal laws requiring all employers to make equal pay more of an imperative, Vagins said, achieving true pay parity for women will be slow in coming.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/12/success/equal-pay-day-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "business"}}

In a statement late Tuesday, Israel\u2019s Communications Minister Shlomo Karhi said that he\u00a0\u201chas ordered that the equipment be returned to the\u00a0AP news agency,\u201d\u00a0because\u00a0the Israeli\u00a0\u201cMinistry of Defense requested to re-examine the matter of broadcasts from sensitive locations and their effect on the risk of our forces.\u201d Earlier in the day, the Associated Press said Israeli authorities had shut down its live camera feed showing Gaza and seized its equipment in what it decried as an \u201cabusive use by the Israeli government of the country\u2019s new foreign broadcasters law.\u201d \u201cThe Associated Press decries in the strongest terms the actions of the Israeli government,\u201d the non-profit news collective said in a statement. \u201cWe urge the Israeli authorities to return our equipment and enable us to reinstate our live feed immediately so we can continue to provide this important visual journalism to thousands of media outlets around the world.\u201d Karhi said that the AP feed was cut and equipment seized because the AP was providing Al Jazeera with content after the Qatari-based network was banned in the country. The Israeli military regularly classifies areas around Gaza as \u201cclosed military zones,\u201d restricting movement there. The AP\u2019s live feed provided a view of actions in Gaza, where no independent journalists are able to operate because of Israeli and Egyptian restrictions on entry to the strip. The Israeli government\u2019s decision to return broadcasting equipment to the AP came after the White House expressed concerns to the Netanyahu-led government, a White House official told CNN. \u201cAs soon as we learned about the reports, the White House and the State Department immediately engaged with the Government of Israel at high levels to express our serious concern and ask them to reverse this action, which they have publicly committed to do,\u201d National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson told CNN. \u201cThe free press is an essential pillar of democracy and members of the media, including AP, do vital work that must be respected.\u201d The Associated Press applauded the Israeli Ministry of Communications\u2019 decision\u00a0to return its equipment but said it remained concerned about the law at the center of the action. \u201cWhile we are pleased with this development, we remain concerned about the Israeli government\u2019s use of the foreign broadcaster law and the ability of independent journalists to operate freely in Israel.\u201d Earlier, the Foreign Press Association voiced its alarm about the shutdown and confiscation. \u201cIsrael\u2019s move today is a slippery slope. Israel could block other international news agencies from providing live footage of Gaza. It also could allow Israel to block media coverage of virtually any news event on vague security grounds,\u201d the FPA said in a statement. The move comes weeks after\u00a0Israel shut down Al Jazeera\u2019s operations\u00a0in the country, raiding the news outlet\u2019s offices and seizing its communication equipment, prompting swift condemnation from the United Nations and rights groups over Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s moves to restrict press freedoms. The law approved by Israel\u2019s parliament last month gives the prime minister and the communications minister the authority to \u201ctemporarily\u201d order the closure of foreign networks operating in Israel that are deemed a threat to national security. News organizations could be banned for a 45-day period, although the government can renew the ban for additional 45-day periods. The law itself is also technically temporary and will expire on July 31 or earlier if an emergency declaration due to the war is canceled. Several legal challenges to the law are pending in Israeli courts. The Israeli Supreme Court recently declined to issue an emergency injunction against the law filed by The Association for Civil Rights in Israel, although a hearing is expected to be held on the challenge by June 6. The group said in its petition filed in early April that the law \u201cviolates freedom of expression, the right to information and freedom of the press,\u201d and \u201ctramples on the principles of the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary, since it includes an \u201coverride clause\u201d that prevents the court from overturning an illegal decision.\u201d Another legal challenge has been filed in the Tel Aviv District Court. In an earlier statement, Karhi had accused the AP of violating its new law by providing a feed to its thousands of news clients, including Al Jazeera. The confiscated equipment included a camera, tripod, two microphones and transmission equipment, the statement said. The press freedom group Reporters Without Borders condemned Israel\u2019s decision to seize the equipment. \u201cAfter having banned Al Jazeera, Israel is lashing out at the AP,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cRSF denounces the seizure of the news outlet\u2019s camera and the interruption of the continuous feed that films Gaza under the pretext that these images are supplying, among others, Al Jazeera.\u201d The Union of Israeli Journalists also condemned the act, calling it \u201ca serious threat to press freedom and democracy.\u201d Israel opposition leader Yair Lapid also denounced the seizure as \u201can act of madness.\u201d \u201cThis is not Al Jazeera, this is an American media outlet that has won 53 Pulitzer Prizes,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThis government behaves as if it has decided to make sure at any cost that Israel will be outcast all over the world.

{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_judges-stern-rebuke-of-elon-musks-x-gives-researchers-fresh-hope", "text": "A federal judge\u2019s decision this week reprimanding Elon Musk\u2019s X will have reverberating effects on efforts to hold influential online platforms accountable, legal experts and advocacy groups say. On Monday, District Judge Charles Breyer dismissed and excoriated a lawsuit by X against online watchdog group Center for Countering Digital Hate as an attempt to silence the non-profit group for sounding alarms about hate speech on the platform. Breyer wrote in Monday\u2019s order that the lawsuit was \u201cunabashedly\u201d about \u201cpunishing\u201d reports written by CCDH, which X had accused of campaigning to drive away its advertisers. Breyer held that the reports were \u201cunquestionably\u201d protected by the group\u2019s free speech rights. Now, that decision could embolden other research groups and Musk critics who have faced legal threats from the billionaire. The CCDH case \u2014 in the US District Court for the Northern District of California \u2014\u00a0has been widely viewed as a bellwether for research and accountability on X, where Musk has restored the accounts of previously banned White supremacists and spreaders of misinformation and where Musk himself has amplified various conspiracy theories. And CCDH is not the only organization that has faced attacks by self-proclaimed \u201cfree speech absolutist\u201d Musk after criticizing or raising concerns about his platform. \u201cThis is an important decision that sees Elon Musk\u2019s lawsuit for what it is \u2014 an effort to punish his critics for constitutionally protected speech and to deter researchers from studying his platform,\u201d said Alex Abdo, litigation director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, which had filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the case arguing that private companies should not be allowed to use breach of contract claims to punish criticism. \u201cSociety needs reliable and ethical research into social media platforms, and often that research relies on being able to study publicly available posts,\u201d Abdo said. X said it plans to appeal Breyer\u2019s decision. Musk\u2019s threats against X critics In his first year as owner of X, formerly known as Twitter, Musk threatened legal action against the Anti-Defamation League for defamation, as well as against Microsoft and Meta for allegedly improper data and trade secret access, respectively. None of those threats ever amounted to real lawsuits. He did, however, sue the progressive media watchdog Media Matters over its\u00a0analysis\u00a0highlighting antisemitic and pro-Nazi content on X, alleging that the group\u2019s testing methodology was not representative of how real users experience the site and that the report was designed to drive away advertisers. Legal experts have described that case as \u201cweak\u201d on the merits and as a \u201cbogus\u201d attempt to chill criticism of X. This week\u2019s court decision may be only a temporary setback in Musk\u2019s wider plan to stifle criticism, said Media Matters CEO Angelo Carusone. Musk\u2019s new playbook, Carusone said, enlists the help of sympathetic Republican attorneys general to investigate independent reporting organizations and tie them up in legal proceedings. The states of Texas and Missouri each announced probes into Media Matters following X\u2019s lawsuit against the group, to which Musk responded, \u201cGreat!\u201d As recently as Monday, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey filed a petition in state court seeking to compel Media Matters\u2019 cooperation with his investigation. The filing came a week after he appeared with Musk in a live event on X \u2014 which Carusone said shows how Musk hopes to deputize the power of government to silence his critics. \u201cThey have every reason to do it,\u201d Carusone said of the AGs\u2019 investigations. \u201cThey get the political benefits, they get the attention. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any cost to them yet. And if they are successful at developing this new playbook, this new terrain, legally, then it\u2019s going to pave the way for them to just use this tool and tactic over and over and over again.\u201d A representative for X did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Carusone\u2019s claims. Researchers face hurdles to studying on-platform behavior Researchers from non-profits and academic institutions have had a harder time studying X since Musk\u2019s takeover in 2022. Academics need large samples of posts, shares, likes and other data to study social media trends in mis- and disinformation, public health, elections and other key topics. But one of Musk\u2019s first changes at X was to put access to platform data behind a steep paywall. Researchers and civil society groups said the new subscription fees \u2014 costing up to $2.5 million a year \u2014\u00a0were \u201coutrageously expensive\u201d and made it impossible to do their work, reducing transparency of a critical platform. The change may have forced some researchers to rely more heavily on first-person observational data to draw conclusions about user behavior on X. Groups like CCDH have also used automated \u201cscraping\u201d of publicly viewable content from X rather than paying the company for data directly, a tactic that helped give rise to X\u2019s initial lawsuit. Efforts by X and other social media companies to limit research transparency makes them less accountable to the public at best and, at worst, could mask malicious behavior, said David Karpf, an associate professor in the School of Media and Public Affairs at George Washington University. \u201cWe need independent research to have any real measure of what\u2019s going on at X/Twitter. Musk is only ever going to release data that makes his company look good,\u201d Karpf said. \u201cThese platforms are too big and too vital to the spread of information to be left unmonitored.\u201d \u201cThis is an election year,\u201d Karpf added, \u201cand the platforms are taking steps to make it harder to monitor how their services are used for malignant ends.\u201d Free Press, another media accountability organization that has been critical of Musk\u2019s leadership of X and which called for advertisers to pause their spending on the platform shortly after his takeover, also celebrated Breyer\u2019s ruling as potentially removing at least one hurdle that watchdog organizations face. \u201cThe guardrails for democracy are hanging by a thread and we have dwindling insights into platform practices as researchers face lawsuits, congressional subpoenas and other scare tactics,\u201d said Nora Benavidez, senior counsel and director of digital rights at Free Press. Ultimately, Benavidez called the ruling \u201ca reminder that platform accountability is essential and will inevitably prevail when up against bullies like Musk who try to silence us.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/judges-stern-rebuke-of-elon-musks-x-gives-researchers-fresh-hope/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_05_24_business_biden-gas-prices-memorial-day", "text": "For many Americans, Memorial Day weekend marks the start of the summer travel season as millions of people head to parks, beaches and other vacation destinations. This summer is no exception: Nearly 44 million people are expected to skip town this Memorial Day, the highest number since 2005, according to AAA. Road trips, in particular, are expected to set a record, which could send gas prices higher. There\u2019s no relief in the air, either: Thursday was the second-busiest day for travel in TSA history, as it screened just shy of 2.9 million passengers. Friday is expected to be even busier. This week, the Biden administration said it would take action to keep prices at the pump in check, selling one million barrels of gasoline from a never-before-used emergency stockpile called the Northeast Gasoline Supply Reserve. \u201cBy strategically releasing this reserve in between Memorial Day and July 4th, we are ensuring sufficient supply flows to the tri-state and northeast at a time hardworking Americans need it the most,\u201d Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said in a statement on Tuesday. But, just as a US president cannot solely take the blame for surging oil prices, nor can he or she, in most cases, be entirely credited for steadying prices. The true impact of this strategic release will likely be negligible, oil market experts said \u2013 and the sale was mandated by Congress earlier this year. \u201cThis is a non-starter and won\u2019t do much to lower gas prices,\u201d GasBuddy\u2019s Patrick DeHaan said. \u201cBut it will help get rid of a reserve that wasn\u2019t really practical or usable.\u201d Although a strategic sale of one million barrels of gas sounds like a lot, the US consumed nearly 9 million gasoline barrels per day last year, according to the US Energy Information Administration. That means the Biden administration\u2019s planned release, which will happen in the coming weeks, translates to less than three hours of national demand. While the Biden administration may have timed the sale from the government-owned oil supply to coincide with the busy holiday travel season, Congress directed the administration to draw down and close the NSGR, created as part of then-President Obama\u2019s response to Superstorm Sandy. According to the US Department of Energy, the reserve was created after the 2012 storm caused heavy damage to oil refineries in the Northeast, leaving some gas stations without fuel for weeks. The reserve currently holds gasoline barrels in New York and Maine. Biden has tapped other US-owned oil reserves during his presidency. In the wake of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Biden attempted to stem rising oil prices by authorizing the release of 180 million barrels of oil in coordination with US allies overseas. At the time, the President said it would act as a \u201cwartime bridge\u201d as the US and global oil production ramped back up after the Covid-19 pandemic. Tom Kloza, the global head of energy analysis at the Oil Price Information Service, said he believed the Biden administration would be making a mistake if he were to take credit for recent steady oil prices after the one-million-barrel release. \u201cBy depicting this as a move to save consumers money, they risk being blamed if prices spike higher this summer,\u201d said Tom Kloza, the global head of energy analysis at the Oil Price Information Service. While Kloza doesn\u2019t expect a surge in oil prices, he said it was possible that warm summer temperatures could cause refineries to shut down or slow, causing a price spike. Gas prices have remained steady in recent weeks after rising sharply at the end of winter. On Thursday, the national average for regular gas was $3.61, slightly above the average since 2020, according to AAA. The current price at the pump is slightly higher than it was heading into Memorial Day last year at $3.54 a gallon, but significantly lower than the price two years ago, when the national average was above $4.50. - CNN\u2019s Matt Egan and Gregory Wallace contributed to this report.

That\u2019s an indication that the economy is not being held back by inflation, even though price hikes have started to ease once more. \u201cTech is the only industry sector not in the red,\u201d wrote Louis Navellier of Navellier Investing in a note to clients on Thursday. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have NVIDIA in your index it\u2019s not a good day.\u201d Labor data also came in stronger than expected on Thursday morning: Weekly initial jobless claims totaled 215,000, slightly below the analyst consensus of 220,000, according to FactSet data. April new home sales missed estimates on Thursday, coming in at an annualized rate of 634,000 versus 678,000 expected. Fewer homes being built indicates that there\u2019s less economic confidence on the part of builders and that they\u2019re having more difficulty borrowing the money to build them. Fed fears The Federal Reserve spooked markets on Wednesday afternoon when they released the notes from their last policy meeting. The minutes showed that \u201cvarious\u201d officials said they would be willing to raise interest rates if necessary and that there were doubts as to whether financial conditions are restrictive enough to keep inflation from resurging. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon also said Wednesday at an event hosted by Boston College that the Fed probably won\u2019t begin to cut rates this year. \u201cI\u2019m still at zero cuts,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we\u2019re set up for stickier inflation.\u201d \u201cThe bond market set the dour mood that we see across much of the market,\u201d wrote Interactive Brokers chief strategist Steve Sosnick on Thursday. US Treasury yields rose Thursday on the positive economic news. \u201cComing on the back of yesterday\u2019s \u2018higher for longer\u2019 Fed Minutes, bond traders were in no mood to hear about a strengthening economy,\u201d wrote Sosnick. \u201cIn theory, a stronger economy should be good for companies, and thus stocks, but because we are all so obsessed with the Federal Reserve and other central bank policymakers, we see most stocks trending lower as bond prices fall.\u201d Those central bank worries have pushed investors to slash their expectations for interest rate cuts from the Fed. They\u2019re now anticipating just one cut this year, in December, according to the CME FedWatch tool. That\u2019s down from six at the beginning of the year.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/investing/dow-falls-waiting-fed-rate-cut/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_05_25_business_why-do-we-eat-popcorn-at-the-movies", "text": "Even before the house lights dim, the cinema experience is well under way, with one concession-stand food holding top billing. Its roasty, buttery aroma fills the lobby, a smell that\u2019s both unmistakable and, often, core memory-inducing. A kernel smacks the side of a stainless steel kettle, a hint of the percussive symphony to come. As a white, fluffy wave boils up, the contents are scooped into a tub and drizzled \u2014 if you are lucky \u2014 with real melted butter. And as you slide into a cushioned seat, the delicate puffs give way to a soft crunch. It\u2019s Memorial Day weekend, the traditional start to the summer blockbuster movie season, and for 90-plus years and through generation after generation, the salty and buttery treat\u2019s symbiotic relationship with the cinema has remained. \u201cPopcorn and the movies are as inextricably linked as Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, peanut butter and chocolate; and, as such, represent perhaps one of the greatest duos in modern history,\u201d Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore, told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine a more perfect combination and one that has become part of the culture in such a profound and ubiquitous way.\u201d The nation\u2019s largest movie chain, AMC Theaters, pops enough popcorn to fill 222 Olympic-sized swimming pools every year, according to the company. But the perfect (and very profitable) pairing of today wasn\u2019t always the case: For many years, movie theaters wanted nothing to do with the snack. A match made in oil and butter There\u2019s plenty of lore packed in to popcorn\u2019s origin story and a fair bit of drama involved in its \u201cshotgun wedding\u201d with the movies, according to Andrew F. Smith\u2019s \u201cPopped Culture: A Social History of Popcorn in America.\u201d Smith, in cataloging popcorn\u2019s rise, debunked most of the long-ingrained fables behind the snack. It was not a \u201cfirst Thanksgiving\u201d side dish but rather landed in New England in the early half of the 19th century, likely brought there by American sailors returning from South America. Popping corn became a popular recreational activity by the 1840s, after \u201cwire-on-the-fire\u201d poppers and popping apparatuses were invented. In the following decades, popcorn vendors proliferated at fairs, circuses and on city streets. More commercial operations emerged, Cracker Jack became a ballpark staple and a slow courtship with the movie exhibition business began. That business, saved by the advent of the \u201ctalkie,\u201d blossomed during the early 20th century. By 1930, a stunning 90 million people were going to the movies on a weekly basis, Smith wrote. The crowd appeared ripe for the picking to popcorn salesmen, but theater owners balked. \u201cTo some owners, vending all concessions was an unnecessary nuisance or \u2018beneath their dignity,\u2019\u201d Smith wrote. \u201cIn the rowdy, burlesque days, hawkers went through the aisles with baskets selling Cracker Jack and popcorn. Much of the popcorn was tossed in the air or strewn on the floors.\u201d In cinemas, the scattered popcorn bits would muck up the valuable carpet that was meant to emulate the grand theater lobbies. But cinema owners changed their tune, and popcorn\u2019s boom came during one of the unlikeliest of economic periods: The Great Depression. \u201cAt five or 10 cents a bag, popcorn was an affordable luxury for most Americans,\u201d Smith wrote. The popcorn-making initially took place outside of the theaters, where operators leased space to vendors as it was seen as too costly to outfit the buildings with vents. But once competitors started popping up and tales of \u201cpopcorn wealth\u201d spread like wildfire, the concession was brought in-house. \u201cPopcorn sold so well because of its aroma \u2014 the same smell that some theater owners had reportedly despised earlier,\u201d Smith wrote. \u201cThe aroma was maximized during the popping process. As soon as the machines were placed in the lobbies, business picked up.\u201d A national pastime On a recent Sunday morning here in South Minneapolis, a decades-long father-son tradition continued at the Riverview Theater, a single-screen cinema nestled among century-old bungalows. Ever since John Aitkin, 44, was a kid, he and his father, John Sr., have been catching movies at the Riverview. As they awaited the start of \u201cKingdom of the Planet of the Apes,\u201d they were accompanied by other longstanding members of the monthly custom: a bucket of popcorn and a couple of soda pops. \u201c(Popcorn\u2019s) a pastime,\u201d the younger Aitkin said. \u201cWhen I\u2019m eating it, it makes everything feel OK. It\u2019s just \u2018popcorn and a movie,\u2019 and you can disappear from the anxiety of daily living.\u201d It\u2019s also an affordable escape. The medium bucket ran Aitkin a cool $2.50, half the price of his ticket that day. (This is the exception: In some regions, popcorn can easily run three or four times that.) The Riverview popcorn\u2019s fame and popularity extends beyond the walls of the 75-year-old building. For years, the neighborhood cinema has sold it to-go, an offering that helped the theater navigate 2020, said Loren Williams, the Riverview\u2019s owner. \u201cWhen the pandemic came, that was all we had,\u201d he told CNN of the community support. The post-pandemic picture After the pandemic reopenings, people were not only buying premium tickets, but also spending more on concessions, said Alicia Reese, an analyst who covers the media and entertainment industry for Wedbush. \u201cWe thought that there was just pent-up demand for going out and [people] treating themselves,\u201d she said. \u201cBut this trend has persisted. It has not declined, and it\u2019s still growing.\u201d That\u2019s good news for theater operators at a time when attendance hasn\u2019t yet returned to pre-pandemic levels. That\u2019s because, at their heart, cinemas are mostly food service and real estate operations, said Ricard Gil, an associate professor who specializes in organizational economics at Queen\u2019s University in Canada. Generally, the ticket revenue is split 50-50 between the theater operators and the movie studios, said Gil, who previously researched why movie theater concessions come at steep prices. For the exhibitors, that half (or, oftentimes, less) isn\u2019t enough to recoup all the other costs. Concessions account for about one-third of overall domestic sales at the largest US chains of AMC and Cinemark, Wedbush\u2019s Reese said. \u201cOver 80% of that revenue is going to profit, which is substantial and unlike most other businesses,\u201d she said. \u201cThe reason for that is that most of the concession sales are popcorn, where the cost is quite low.\u201d Droids and sandworms filled with popcorn In 2023, AMC Theatres\u2019 food and beverage business totaled $1.67 billion in revenue, financial filings show. (By comparison, that\u2019s more than the annual revenue of restaurant chains like BJ\u2019s, Waffle House and Red Robin). \u201cThe sun rises and sets on our concession business,\u201d Nels Storm, AMC Theatres\u2019 vice president of food and beverage product strategy, said in an interview. And popcorn, he said, remains the \u201cvenerable force\u201d behind that business. But, given external threats to the industry, such as at-home entertainment and more options competing for consumers\u2019 almighty dollar, popcorn has to evolve with the times. For AMC, that\u2019s included launching a line of microwave and ready-to-eat popcorn for sale at retailers like Walmart and Kroger, offering unique or movie-themed flavors and leaning heavily into merchandising. Popular movies often bring collectible cups and popcorn buckets, or, in industry-speak, Collectible Concession Vehicles (CCVs). At AMC, these have included R2-D2 popcorn buckets; Ghostbusters\u2019 Ecto 1; the infamous Dune: Part Two sandworm; and, coming in June, a \u201cGarfield\u201d CCV that includes a plush doll \u2014 a fitting throwback to the days when stuffed versions of the lasagna-loving tabby were suctioned-cupped to car windows. For years, cinemas have broadened their concessions, with some taking it to the next level of dine-in theaters. Alamo Drafthouse, which got its start in 1997, offers a full menu and bar (complete with servers). Despite the full menu, popcorn remains the most frequently purchased food item, said Heather Morgan, Alamo\u2019s chief of staff and strategy. Alamo is quick to experiment with its popcorn and other concessions by tying them in to various theme nights, she said, noting that the chain created a berbere-spiced popcorn for \u201cDune: Part Two.\u201d \u201cWe can see an uptick in sales, because people want to try the new and different flavors,\u201d she said. Chocolate popcorn and homegrown flavors Those unique takes extend to smaller theaters, as well. In Brooklyn, New York, Nitehawk Cinema is known for its truffle popcorn.  In Iowa City, Iowa, the nonprofit FilmScene cinema uses a recipe handed down from the University of Iowa\u2019s student cinema group. \u201cWe don\u2019t offer butter, and we promise you don\u2019t need it,\u201d Andrew Sherburne, FilmScene\u2019s executive director and co-founder, wrote via email to CNN. In Seattle, Emerald City film-lovers rejoiced when the iconic Cinerama theater was resurrected after a pandemic closure and its famed chocolate popcorn returned. At Cinelounge Cinemas in California, founder Christian Meoli crafted a line of eight artisan popcorns to be sold onsite, online and in stores. The movie-themed offerings \u2014 featuring flavors such as cinnamon churro, bourbon caramel and rosemary \u2014 also serve as a vehicle to spur investment in the film community: The proceeds help fund grants, screenings and equipment for aspiring filmmakers, he said. The cinema business will continue to evolve, but one thing will remain constant, said Gil of Queen\u2019s University. \u201cThe only economics of movie theaters that has changed is the romanticism of showing movies has gone away a little bit, and movie theater companies have realized that they are real estate companies, and they have capacity, and they need to fill the capacity, and they\u2019ll do whatever (it takes) to actually do that,\u201d Gil said. \u201cTheaters will stop playing movies before they will actually stop selling popcorn.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/business/why-do-we-eat-popcorn-at-the-movies/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_25_business_red-lobster-bankruptcy-thai-union", "text": "When seafood conglomerate Thai Union Group became Red Lobster\u2019s leading shareholder in 2020, gaining 49% control of the chain, Red Lobster employees were assured Thai Union would not interfere in key decisions. Thai Union will \u201cnot be involved in Red Lobster\u2019s day-to-day operations, including [its] supply chain standards and processes,\u201d according to a document titled \u201cSeafood Supplier Talking Points\u201d viewed by CNN that was approved by top Thai Union and Red Lobster executives. \u201cWe intend to maintain relationships with all current seafood suppliers,\u201d the talking points said. Those pledges didn\u2019t last. By 2022, representatives from Thai Union in Thailand, whose $4 billion empire includes brands like Chicken of the Sea and John West Foods, were embedded in Red Lobster\u2019s Orlando headquarters, serving in top roles and closely directing the largest seafood restaurant chain in the world. \u201cWe are much deeper involved in the management of Red Lobster,\u201d Thai Union finance chief Ludovic Garnier said on an analyst call in November 2022. Now, Red Lobster has drowned in a relentless supply of Thai Union-supplied shrimp. Red Lobster filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy Sunday, and it plans to sell its business to its lenders. In turn, Red Lobster will receive financing to stay afloat. Thai Union\u2019s damaging decisions drove the pioneering chain\u2019s fall, according to 13 former Red Lobster executives and senior leaders in various areas of the business as well as analysts. All but two of the former Red Lobster employees spoke to CNN under the condition of anonymity because of either non-disclosure agreements with Thai Union; fear that speaking out would harm their careers; or because they don\u2019t want to jeopardize deferred compensation from Red Lobster. Thai Union earlier this year blamed the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as \u201csustained industry headwinds, higher interest rates and rising material and labor costs\u201d for Red Lobster\u2019s struggles. In a statement to CNN, Thai Union said it \u201chas a been a supplier to Red Lobster for more than 30 years, and we intend for that relationship to continue.\u201d A bankruptcy process \u201cwill allow Red Lobster to restructure its financial obligations and realize its long-term potential in a more favorable operating environment,\u201d the company said.\u00a0Thai Union did not respond to CNN\u2019s questions about the specific allegations raised in this story. Former Red Lobster employees say that while the pandemic, inflation and rent costs impacted Red Lobster, Thai Union\u2019s ineptitude was the pivotal factor in Red Lobster\u2019s decline. \u201cIt was miserable working there for the last year and a half I was there,\u201d said Les Foreman, a West Coast division vice president who worked at Red Lobster for 20 years and was fired in 2022. \u201cThey didn\u2019t have any idea about running a restaurant company in the United States.\u201d Thai Union asserts control At Red Lobster headquarters, employees prided themselves on a fiercely loyal culture and low turnover. Some employees had been with the chain for 30 and 40 years. But as Thai Union installed executives at the chain, dozens of veteran Red Lobster leaders with deep knowledge of the brand and restaurant industry were fired or resigned in rapid succession. Red Lobster ended up having five CEOs in five years. Thai Union CEO Thiraphong Chansiri visited Red Lobster\u2019s headquarters in 2022 and toured restaurants around the country. He brought along a feng shui consultant named Angel to Orlando, former senior leaders at Red Lobster headquarters told CNN. The consultant determined that executive offices in Orlando were \u201cbad Feng shui and no one should use them,\u201d one former leader told CNN. The executive offices sat empty. Former Red Lobster employees describe a toxic and demoralizing environment as Thai Union-appointed executives descended on headquarters and interim CEO Paul Kenny eventually took over the chain in 2022. Kenny, an Australian-born former CEO of Minor Food, one of Asia\u2019s largest casual dining and quick-service restaurants, was part of the Thai Union-led investor group that acquired Red Lobster. Kenny criticized Red Lobster employees at meetings and made derogatory comments about them, according to former Red Lobster leaders who worked closely with Kenny. Commenting on a woman\u2019s weight at a Red Lobster annual conference in 2022 in Dallas as she walked across a stage to accept an award, Kenny said, \u201cwe need to institute an exercise program in this company,\u201d another former Red Lobster executive told CNN. Kenny did not respond to CNN\u2019s requests for comment on these allegations. Under Kenny, Red Lobster also cut two of its longtime shrimp suppliers\u2014 and competitors to Thai Union \u2014 to purchase more shrimp from Thai Union at higher costs, according to Red Lobster\u2019s bankruptcy filing. Kenny\u2019s decision came \u201cin apparent coordination with Thai Union and under the guise of a \u2018quality review,\u2019\u201d Red Lobster said. These changes culminated in a $20 endless shrimp promotion in 2023 that would come back to haunt Red Lobster. \u201cThai Union exercised an outsized influence on the Company\u2019s shrimp purchasing,\u201d Red Lobster alleged in its bankruptcy filing. Red Lobster said it was \u201cinvestigating whether Mr. Kenny\u2019s decision-making process circumvented the Company\u2019s normal supply chain and demand planning.\u201d Thai Union told CNN that Red Lobster\u2019s accusations in the bankruptcy filing were \u201cmeritless,\u201d and the company looks forward to a \u201cfull representation of the facts.\u201d Red Lobster also slowed investments in dining room upgrades, raised prices and cut labor under Thai Union, former executives and operations leaders say. These decisions pushed away customers and cut into Red Lobster\u2019s sales. Red Lobster\u2019s annual customer count has dropped by 30% since 2019, Red Lobster said in its bankruptcy filing. Paul Kenny steps in Red Lobster was started in 1968 by Bill Darden, an architect of the casual dining revolution in America. General Mills quickly bought Red Lobster and in 1995 spun the chain off into a new company, Darden Restaurants, named after its founder. In 2014, Darden sold Red Lobster to Golden Gate Capital, a private equity firm, for $2.1 billion.\u00a0 To help fund the deal, Red Lobster spun off its real estate. The arrangement wound up hurting Red Lobster because it became stuck with leases it no longer could afford to pay as the business struggled. Two years later, Thai Union took a $575 million minority stake in Red Lobster. In 2020, Thai Union expanded that stake, leading an investor group to buy out Golden Gate Capital and acquire Red Lobster. During the first half of 2021, Red Lobster posted an operating profit, and Thai Union touted Red Lobster\u2019s strength on calls with analysts and company presentations. \u201cRed Lobster\u2019s turnaround continued amid the pandemic,\u201d Thai Union said in a quarterly earnings presentation in August of 2021. There was \u201cclear improvement in Red Lobster operations.\u201d Red Lobster re-hired 26,000 employees from January to August of 2021, Thai Union said in the presentation, and appointed Kelli Valade CEO. Valade brought on a new leadership team, including a new head of finance, chief marketing officer and chief information officer. But Kenny, then a Red Lobster board member, soon began exercising more control. In early 2022, Kenny began visiting Red Lobster\u2019s headquarters more frequently and touring restaurants, former Red Lobster employees who worked closely with Kenny say. At a tense board meeting in late March 2022, Kenny disagreed with Valade that significant further investment was needed in Red Lobster, according to a former Red Lobster leader. He chastised Red Lobster\u2019s management team, which included Valade\u2019s three recently hired executives, this person said. Within 48 hours, Valade resigned, just eight months into her tenure. Another Red Lobster board member who had decades of experience running casual dining restaurants in the United States resigned a day after. Valade was appointed Denny\u2019s CEO two months later. She did not respond to CNN\u2019s requests for comment. Severe cuts Kenny was initially described in a press release announcing Valade\u2019s resignation as a \u201cliaison\u201d between Red Lobster\u2019s leadership and the board of directors \u201cduring this time of transition.\u201d But, at the direction of Thai Union, Kenny became interim CEO, according to Red Lobster\u2019s bankruptcy filing. In the months after Kenny took over, Valade\u2019s leadership team and other veteran leaders left. In July of 2022, the chief operations officer and six vice presidents of operations overseeing restaurants were abruptly fired shortly before Red Lobster\u2019s annual general manager conference. Kenny appointed a Thai Union frozen seafood manager, Trin Tapanya, as Red Lobster\u2019s chief operations officer overseeing restaurants. Tapanya had no experience running restaurants. He did not respond to CNN\u2019s requests for comment. Other Thai Union representatives also became more closely involved across Red Lobster\u2019s supply chain, finance, operations and strategy teams. Under Kenny, changes to restaurant operations and menus alienated customers and staff and hurt sales. Red Lobster started charging for a side salad for the first time, angering some customers. \u201cWhen you spend $43.99 for a meal the salad should be part of it,\u201d one customer said recently on Facebook. \u201cTexas Roadhouse does not charge extra for a side salad. Red Lobster was my favorite place to eat, but no longer.\u201d The chain started leaving tails on shrimp in pasta and eliminated saut\u00e9 stations in kitchens to save on labor costs, according to a different former Red Lobster employee. It also squeezed Red Lobster\u2019s waitstaff, switching from servers covering three tables to 10 and removing a host at the entrance during lunch hours. Thai Union said at the time it was to improve customer service, but former Red Lobster employees say the change\u00a0taxed restaurant staff. Overstretched restaurant staff had fewer managers and cooks than ever, said Barry Fulghum, who started out as a dishwasher at Red Lobster in the 1970s and worked his way up to become an operations director, retiring last year. \u201cThere would be times we would have one or two people working the kitchen line,\u201d he said.\u00a0 \u201cWhat those cooks did on the line was amazing given the staffing situation they were dealt.\u201d Removing longtime suppliers Meanwhile, Thai Union took a larger role in Red Lobster\u2019s supply chain decisions, despite pledges in 2020 that it would not interfere. Red Lobster had spent decades developing a wide array of suppliers to buy at competitive prices and mitigate the risks of becoming too reliant on any single supplier. Thai Union blew that up. Red Lobster employees say they were pressured by Thai Union representatives to buy more seafood from Thai Union. Thai Union representatives also began sitting in on meetings between Red Lobster and seafood suppliers, said one of the former Red Lobster employees who witnessed these conversations. Thai Union was the direct competitor of these other seafood suppliers, and suddenly had intimate access to their products, prices and strategy. \u201cOur suppliers were really upset that [Thai Union representatives] were in those meetings with them,\u201d this person said. Shrimp dishes also became a larger focus of Red Lobster\u2019s menu under Thai Union, which was a large shrimp supplier to Red Lobster. \u201cEvery promotion was shrimp-centric,\u201d this person said. Endless shrimp Then came the endless shrimp. Endless shrimp had been a successful limited-time promotion at Red Lobster for nearly 20 years. But last summer, Red Lobster turned $20 \u201cUltimate Endless Shrimp\u201d into a permanent menu item instead. Kenny had been warned by Red Lobster leaders that $20 was too cheap to make a profit, according to a former employee who witnessed these conversations. But Red Lobster went ahead, turning it into an everyday offer in June 2023 and pushing the promotion heavily. (Kenny\u2019s decision was met with \u201csignificant pushback from other members of the [company\u2019s] management team,\u201d Red Lobster also said in its bankruptcy filing.) \u201cWe have a very, very bold proposition for the consumers in the US. It\u2019s $20, so it\u2019s really affordable,\u201d Thai Union finance chief Ludovic Garnier said on an earnings call in August 2023. But the move backfired. Customers sat at tables for long stretches of time, eating course after course of shrimp. Service slowed and wait times grew. Red Lobster lost $11 million following the deal, its bankruptcy filing states.

{"id": "2024_05_24_business_us-economy-whats-happening", "text": "The US economy is giving off weird vibes right now. There are millions of job openings and the unemployment rate is low. In fact, it hasn\u2019t been this low for such a long stretch of time in decades. You\u2019d think that would mean the economy is coasting, since periods of low unemployment are generally associated with higher rates of economic prosperity. But there\u2019s a slew of red flags right now \u2014 like a large and growing share of people, particularly Gen Zers, taking on such high levels of credit card debt to cover their spending that lenders have stopped loaning more money to them. That seems to be the case with a lot of recent economic data: No piece of good news comes without other evidence that give economists pause. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t give the economy a clean bill of health,\u201d said Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY. \u201cIt looks robust, but there are pockets of concern.\u201d But while the state of the economy has economists weighing their words, presidential candidates see it in more binary terms. For instance, President Joe Biden tells voters the economy is booming and has hardly ever been doing better \u2014 even though, as he frequently says, there\u2019s still work to be done. Yet from former President Donald Trump\u2019s vantage point, \u201cthe economy is crashing\u201d and is in total disarray, he said at a recent campaign rally in Wisconsin. Here\u2019s what\u2019s really going on. The good If you\u2019re already optimistic about the economy\u2019s current state, you\u2019re going to feel even better by parsing through some of the latest labor market data. Currently, there are 8.5 million job openings. That exceeds the number of pre-pandemic job openings by 1.5 million. Meanwhile, there are 6.5 million unemployed people. That means there\u2019s more than one job per job seeker. In the decade preceding the pandemic, that ratio was 0.6 on average, signifying there were more job seekers than the number of job openings. Americans\u2019 average hourly earnings are 22% higher than before the pandemic, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Though wage increases have been slowing, they\u2019re rising at a faster rate than prices. That\u2019s good news for consumers, since it means their income is stretching further. The bad Though inflation has cooled significantly from its peak in the summer of 2022, further progress toward the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% target is looking like it\u2019ll be a lengthy process. That trajectory has taken many Fed officials by surprise, including Gov. Christopher Waller who thought the economy would be in a good position for cutting interest rates by now. \u201cHowever, the first three months of 2024 threw cold water on that outlook, as data on both inflation and economic activity came in much hotter than anticipated,\u201d Waller said in a speech Tuesday. But he said April Consumer Price Index data, which showed headline inflation levels cooled slightly, was \u201cwelcome relief.\u201d \u201cIf I were still a professor and had to assign a grade to this inflation report, it would be a C+\u2014 far from failing but not stellar either,\u201d he added. But at the same time,\u00a0consumers believe that inflation will move higher in the year ahead, according to two surveys Fed officials monitor closely. Since inflation expectations can effectively control the pace of price hikes, businesses take those expectations into account when pricing goods and services. That can lead to higher prices. However, an early reading on retail spending for April came in much weaker than expected as consumers reined in their spending. That\u2019s good in the sense that it doesn\u2019t give retailers the ability to pass along higher prices to consumers if they aren\u2019t willing to accept them, which had previously been the case. But given consumer spending is one of the biggest drivers of the economy, a pullback can have adverse effects, too. \u201cIt certainly bears watching, but part of the weakness probably was \u2018payback\u2019 for strength in prior months,\u201d David Alcaly, lead macroeconomic strategist at Lazard, told CNN. Daco said he sees the retail sales report as a sign that consumers are \u201ca little more cautious, but are not retrenching.\u201d However, if spending starts to slow a lot more, that could negatively impact the economy, he said. The ugly The biggest flashing red light in the economy right now is the level of debt people are racking up. One reason consumer spending has held up so well in the face of higher-than-desirable inflation combined with the highest interest rates in over two decades is that consumers aren\u2019t necessarily spending within their means. The savings many accumulated during the pandemic have all but evaporated, leading to a lot more credit card purchases that aren\u2019t being paid back on time. That, combined with the gradually cooling labor market \u2014 which is reducing workers\u2019 leverage \u2014 is causing some households to accumulate more debt and fall into serious delinquency, meaning 90+ days late on a payment. Recent New York Fed data showed the percentage of credit card balances in serious delinquency climbed to its highest level since 2012. \u201cThe rising levels of consumer\u00a0debt\u00a0and delinquency rates, if continued, are not just individual problems; they could have macroeconomic effects requiring attention from economic policymakers,\u201d Sung Won Sohn, a Loyola Marymount University economics and finance professor and chief economist of SS Economics, wrote in a recent note. \u201cAs more income is directed toward\u00a0debt\u00a0repayment, consumers have less disposable income for other purchases.\u201d The rising delinquencies will likely force banks and other lenders to lend less money to borrowers deemed riskier or cause lenders to charge even higher interest rates, he said. Ultimately, these combined effects \u201ccan contribute to a broader economic slowdown \u2014 or even a recession.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/business/us-economy-whats-happening/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "business"}}

Even after years of inflation, geopolitical chaos and recession in Europe, the US economy remains robust and resilient. The reason for that is mostly the American consumer, with spending accounting for about 70% of gross domestic product. But some observers now worry that the economy represents a tale of two Americas. Some businesses and consumers continue to thrive, while others are falling by the wayside. What\u2019s happening: Economic activity in the US remains relatively strong, but there are some signs that the momentum is beginning to cool. Unemployment rose to 3.9% last month, lower-income consumers are spending less and businesses are limiting employee hours and pay. Consumer growth in general is beginning to moderate, but gently. \u201cThat may mask more pronounced financial difficulties for the bottom three income quintiles facing the strenuous combination of higher prices, larger interest burdens and softening job prospects,\u201d said EY chief economist Gregory Daco in a note on Tuesday. While consumer balance sheets are still holding strong in aggregate \u2014 the US has added $40 trillion in wealth since the start of 2020, and Americans haven\u2019t stopped spending \u2014not every balance sheet looks the same. \u201cThe economy is bifurcated into the haves and have-nots, as middle class Americans are struggling with rising prices and lagging wage growth,\u201d said Skyler Weinand, chief investment officer at Regan Capital in a statement. This earnings season exemplifies that growing divide. McDonald\u2019s (MCD) reported that people of all income levels are seeking value. Starbucks (SBUX) said that customers are becoming more particular about where they spend their money. Mondelez (MDLZ) executives discussed an increase in price sensitivity in their earnings call. A recent survey by Santander Bank of its customers found that while inflation fears have largely subsided, middle-income Americans are pessimistic about the economy. About 60% believe the US will enter a recession in the next 12 months, and 62% are making significant cuts to their household spending, the bank found. \u201cIt\u2019s well known that the lowest income consumer is really struggling with inflation, but from a purely economic standpoint, it is the higher quintiles of earners that do the most spending,\u201d Nanette Abuhoff Jacobson, global investment strategist at Hartford Funds, told my colleague Bryan Mena. Why it matters: There are many shapes to a recession. Some economists have speculated that the US has been in a so-called \u201crolling recession\u201d where only certain sectors of the economy are impacted. But there are also recessions that mostly hurt lower-income Americans. A K-shaped recession is what happens when separate communities are hit by and recover from economic downturns at varying rates. Some parts of society may experience renewed growth while others continue to lag behind. While the recovery from the 2020 recession can be described as V-shaped, many point out that it was actually two-pronged. Low-income Black and Hispanic families saw the fastest depletion of their savings during the pandemic, for example. Many who worked in white-collar jobs recovered quickly as the government handed out stimulus payments and as stocks and home prices appreciated. Those without savings and who worked service jobs continued to suffer. Employees receiving the lowest wages were the most likely to lose their jobs in nearly every sector of the economy between 2020 and 2021, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Those Americans could still be suffering, but their stories are obscured by data that paints a broad picture of a resilient economy. What\u2019s next: That bifurcated economy, wrote Daco, will lead some businesses to succeed while others struggle. It \u201cwill also lead to conflicting inflation signals with some sectors experiencing outright deflation and others experiencing persistently elevated inflation,\u201d he said. That could make it a lot more difficult for Federal Reserve officials to decide whether to lower interest rates or keep them steady during their next few policy meetings. There\u2019s a danger that if monetary policy is too strict, it could quickly make financial conditions tougher, said Daco. \u201cThis, along with growing concerns about the country\u2019s financial direction, might cause businesses and consumers to pull back on spending and investment,\u201d he said. Jamie Dimon could step down sooner than expected. Here\u2019s who could run the country\u2019s biggest bank JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has bumped up his retirement plans, the longtime head of America\u2019s largest bank said Monday. Dimon is one of the most well-known and closely listened to CEOs in the world. Over the course of his tenure at JPMorgan Chase, he\u2019s become somewhat synonymous with the largest US bank by assets. But Dimon can\u2019t lead forever, and at 68 years old, the\u00a0question of succession\u00a0has grown more important. The timetable for stepping down \u2014 which he has long joked was \u201cfive years away\u201d any time the question was put to him \u2014 is \u201cnot five years anymore,\u201d Dimon said at the bank\u2019s investor conference this week. Dimon, who has led the bank since 2006, said that while \u201cI still have the energy I\u2019ve always had, I think when I can\u2019t put on the jersey \u2026 I should leave.\u201d Succession plans at the bank, he said, are \u201cwell on the way.\u201d Shares of the company\u2019s stock sold off after Dimon\u2019s announcement, closing 4.3% lower. \u201cWe believe that it will take time for the street to gain comfort with the next CEO and [Monday\u2019s] stock reaction was evidence of that,\u201d wrote Bank of America analysts in a note on Tuesday.\u00a0\u201cDimon\u00a0has delivered unparalleled shareholder returns during his tenure as CEO while navigating the bank through some major macro-economic crises.\u201d The Bank of America analysts forecast that Dimon will step down in late 2025 or 2026, but the specifics of JPMorgan\u2019s succession plans have been the subject of speculation on Wall Street for many years. Earlier this year, some of the bank\u2019s top executives were moved into new roles in order to expand their experience. The bank appointed Marianne Lake as the sole CEO of the consumer division, an area previously run by both Lake and Jennifer Piepszak. Piepszak, meanwhile, now leads the company\u2019s newly combined commercial and investment bank with her co-CEO Troy Rohrbaugh. Rohrbaugh is the former head of trading and securities services for the bank. Other potential successors include Mary Erdoes, CEO of asset and wealth management; chief financial officer Jeremy Barnum and president and chief operating officer Daniel Pinto. In 2020, Dimon experienced an \u201cacute aortic dissection\u201d \u2014 a tear in the inner lining of the aorta blood vessel \u2014 requiring surgery. Then co-COOs Gordon Smith and Daniel Pinto\u00a0led the company in his absence. Smith retired from the bank in January 2022. Microsoft thinks it has found a way to make PCs relevant again Microsoft\u00a0jumped headfirst into building artificial intelligence directly into its Windows operating system on Monday, announcing new AI computers that could help ramp up flagging PC sales. The\u00a0developments push the company closer to its long-time goal\u00a0to \u201cbuild computers that understand us versus us having to understand computers,\u201d\u00a0CEO Satya Nadella told the audience\u00a0at the company\u2019s annual developer conference\u00a0at its Redmond, Washington headquarters. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re really close to that real breakthrough,\u201d he added. The computers, which are packed with processors that power advanced AI tools, come\u00a0as PC sales have stalled for years.

{"id": "2022_04_25_business_electric-hybrid-corvette", "text": "General Motors will produce a fully electric Chevrolet Corvette, GM President Mark Reuss announced in a LinkedIn post Monday morning.  Reuss didn\u2019t say when the electric Corvette would come, but he hinted that a hybrid model could come relatively soon. \u201cWe will offer an electrified Corvette as early as next year,\u201d he wrote. An accompanying video the company posted to Twitter showed what appeared to be a hybrid Corvette, and in another first, showed the front wheels spinning and throwing snow as if being powered. All Corvettes produced by the company previously have been rear-wheel-drive only. While Reuss\u2019s post implies a hybrid Corvette will be based on the current generation of the car, it\u2019s not clear if the all-electric version will be a variation of this car or a completely different future model. \u201cElectrified\u201d is an auto industry term encompassing everything from hybrid to fully electric vehicles, and anything with an electric motor can count as \u201celectrified.\u201d It has long been rumored that the current generation of the Corvette, the first with its gasoline engine mounted behind the seats instead of in the front, could be built with a hybrid system. Reuss has also previously hinted there would be electrified variants of the car. Various companies are working on electric sports cars. Most all-electric vehicles in production so far have been four-door sedans and SUVs, as the need for batteries lends itself to larger and heavier vehicles. Tesla\u2019s first car, the Lotus Elise-based Tesla Roadster, was an electric sports car, but the second-generation of Tesla Roadster, originally unveiled as a prototype in 2017, has yet to go into production. Some manufacturers, such as Lamborghini, have said that current battery technology doesn\u2019t allow for a optimum sports car performance from a purely electric vehicle. Lamborghini has been working on plug-in hybrid sports cars, though. To date, the Corvette is only available in the base Stingray version with 6.2-liter V8 engine producing up to 495 horsepower. A 670 horsepower Corvette Z06 with a 5.5-liter V8 was unveiled last fall. The previous generation of the Corvette included included a 755-horsepower ZR1 version. Nothing like that has yet been announced for the current model but GM engineers have said a major reason for putting the engine in the back was to allow for better performance at extremely high horsepower levels. Besides saving gas, hybrid systems can also be used in high-performance cars to add additional power and to provide for quicker acceleration since electric motors can provide power to the wheels more quickly than gas engines. Ferrari\u2019s most powerful sports cars are hybrids, for instance.   GM has said it plans to produce only zero-emission vehicles, meaning fully electric or powered by hydrogen fuel cells, by 2035.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/25/business/electric-hybrid-corvette/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_business_ace-hardware-staying-power", "text": "Mahin Barker said soccer moms keep her on her toes at her store in West Lake Hills on the outskirts of Austin, Texas. They come in nearly every day and they\u2019re keen to shop. \u201cThey have a lot of time and disposable income to spend so we have to keep our merchandise fresh because they\u2019re here so often,\u201d she said. The store she runs is an Ace Hardware. The 100-year-old, Oak Brook, Illinois-based hardware chain, which has permeated America\u2019s smaller neighborhoods with more than 5,000 locations, appears to be pulling in shoppers even as its big-box hardware rivals Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s are struggling to do the same. One indicator is how frequently people are heading to Ace Hardware versus its competitors. Monthly customer traffic to Ace Hardware locations is up so far this year versus a year ago, compared to mostly dropping shopper traffic every month to Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s stores over the same period, according to Placer. ai, which uses location data from mobile devices to estimate visits to specific retailer locations. Also, all three retailers reported their quarterly sales this month and it wasn\u2019t a pretty picture for the industry Goliaths. Home Depot\u2019s same-store sales (or sales at stores open at least a year) in the US fell 3.2% in its latest quarter both as shoppers pulled back on remodels and renovations and also on discretionary decorative-type purchases to spruce up their homes. Home Depot\u2019s stock price is down 5% so far in 2024. Lowe\u2019s sales at stores open at least a year fell a steep 4.1% in its latest quarter for similar reasons. Lowe\u2019s stock price has dipped 7% in the past month.  \u201cThe danger here is that while Home Depot has a commanding position, it faces much more competition on the light-side improvement space from smaller improvement players, garden centers, and specialists like Sherwin Williams in categories like paint,\u201d Neil Saunders, retail analyst and managing director at Globaldata Retail, wrote in a note last week. \u201cConsumers are now shopping around more to find the best bargains and deals,\u201d he said. These trends appear to be working in Ace Hardware\u2019s favor. The hardware chain saw a small increase in its US same-store sales in its most recent quarter and a 1.1% increase in the average amount people spent per store trip. Total revenue for the company systemwide rose 2.5% in the period from a year ago. It expects to open 200 new stores in 2024. Small and mighty stores Ace Hardware\u2019s store setup \u2014 smaller-sized shops of 7,000 to 10,000 square feet on average \u2014 situated within communities and selling much more than just nuts, bolts and paint are resonating with the evolving shopping psyche of today\u2019s rushed consumers, industry watchers said. Each store carries about 25,000 to 30,000 unique products. \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting phenomenon,\u201d said Michael Brown, partner in consulting firm Kearney\u2019s\u00a0consumer products and retail practice. \u201cAce is your local customized, intimate hardware store where I can go in, get something very quickly, talk to people that I know. It\u2019s also close to home and I can easily meet my small project needs,\u201d he said. Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s, by contrast, cater to the contractor or the homeowner doing big remodeling work. And while bigger home renovation projects have slowed in recent months, those larger hardware stores have suffered sales declines. Ace, meanwhile, benefits as people turn to smaller fix-it projects, he said. \u201cThey\u2019re positioned quite well now geographically to service the needs of the consumer today,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve build a unique niche and their stores are also bringing a local flavor to them.\u201d Barker is owner and operator of five Breed & Co Ace Hardware locations in the Austin, Texas, area. The West Lake Hills store, in particular, is popular with women. While the store stocks typical hardware needs such as screws, drill bits and hammers, Barker goes to great lengths to offer the unexpected. \u201cI like to call it a boutique atmosphere,\u201d she said. She said upper-income customers have expectations of better service. \u201cIf you want to continue to have that consistent repeat business you got to give them what they want.\u201d In addition to hardware and garden products, the housewares section offers a wedding registry. \u201cIt\u2019s a very unique proposition because we don\u2019t have a lot of competition in terms of local, relevant and differentiated retailing here,\u201d Barker said. The registry idea arose from a local need. \u201cWe noticed that a lot of brides don\u2019t necessarily want to get what Aunt May buys for them,\u201d she said. Engaged couples, she said, sometimes prefer picking items such as a grill or plants. So we\u2019ve really beefed up that side of the business to stay relevant to our customers.\u201d Jewelry is a top seller, too, as are pricey Le Crueset pots and pans, Nest candles, baby products such as plush toys, baby onesie pajamas and truffle chocolates. \u201cWe sell a ton of Le Crueset. It\u2019s one of our top performers,\u201d Barker said. \u201cMany of our customers are grandparents going to a baby shower and they need a gift. We count on people coming in everyday to buy a gift item from us.\u201d This hybrid hardware-home goods-curio model is setting Ace Hardware stores apart. \u201cConsumers are looking for new places to shop,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost places like Bed Bath & Beyond and Linens \u2018n Things, where you go to buy a curtain rod or smaller home needs. Ace is nicely filling that void.\u201d A retail cooperative Ace Hardware, with its catchy jingle \u201cAce is the place with the helpful hardware folks,\u201d was founded in 1924 by a group of four Chicago hardware store owners. It operates a unique structure in which only 4% of its more than 6,000 worldwide stores are company owned. The retailer, instead runs as a retail-owned cooperative, which means individual store operators are also part owners, making them independent entrepreneurs. \u201cThey are essentially shareholders, they own the brand and the company,\u201d said Kim Lefko, chief marketing officer of Ace Hardware. Individual store owners, who make up more than 90% of the business, select products in two ways: They can order and stock national brands and private label products in bulk at a lower price directly from Ace Hardware\u2019s warehouses. They also have the flexibility to curate about 20% of the merchandise mix to suit local tastes and needs by ordering directly from other vendors, Lefko said. \u201cDuring the post World War I era, the four business owners much like today wanted to be competitive in the marketplace. They got together and the very first product they bought was a truckload of sponges so they could be price competitive,\u201d said Lefko. \u201cThis really is the co-op structure. It keeps us competitive against the like of Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s, together with the ability to also tailor the products to what the local community needs.\u201d But all stores are still unified under Ace\u2019s national marketing and advertising effort, she said. Ace is pushing innovation with the brand, too. It just launched its first Ace-branded food product, a line of BBQ sauces, and a collection of Ace Hardware vintage-inspired clothing. Legendary NFL coach and broadcaster John Madden served as a pitchman for Ace Hardware for more than 20 years while his NFL broadcast partner Pat Summerall was a pitchman for rival hardware chain, True Value. In many of the same neighborhoods, Ace Hardware has gone head-to-head with True Value, which operated a similar model to Ace for many years, a cooperative partly owned by its roughly 4,000 store owners. Private equity firm Acon Investments purchased True Value in 2018 and ended its time as cooperative retail chain. Michael Wynn, owner of Sunshine Ace Hardware with 12 locations in the Southern Florida area, is catering to a different demographic in his community \u2013- fishermen. Among the locally curated products he stocks next to plumbing, electrical supplies and hardware are fishing gear \u2014 reels, rods, tackles and Yeti coolers. \u201cWe have the largest assortment in southwest Florida,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we also sell homemade fudge and Vera Bradley bags and pouches.\u201d \u201cPeople are time starved. They want quick and convenient shopping experience and we\u2019re trying to give them that,\u201d Wynn said, whose grandfather founded the first Sunshine Ace in 1958. So he added a drive-thru window in one of his newer stores. He\u2019s glad he did. He said a customer recently pulled up to pick up an order but his child was agitated and made it difficult for the man to come into the store. \u201cSo he requested that the store clerk bring the order to him,\u201d said Wynn. \u201cThis for me is a big part of why we try to offer unique services and look out for our customers.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/business/ace-hardware-staying-power/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "business"}}

The conference, which is widely anticipated each year as a major showcase for Apple software news, will run Monday, June 10 through Friday, June 14. Although last year\u2019s WWDC focused on the unveiling of the Vision Pro mixed reality headset, which launched in stores in February, this year is expected to turn to Apple\u2019s AI efforts. The company is reportedly interested in licensing and building Google\u2019s Gemini AI engine, which includes chatbots and other AI tools, into upcoming iPhones and its iOS 18 features. As more tech companies pour billions of dollars into the development and rollout of artificial intelligence, Apple has largely been left out of the conversation, with many other tech companies making big strides in the space. A partnership with Google would catapult Apple into the growing AI arms race. Apple researchers also recently said they\u2019ve developed a family of multimodal models \u2014 which refers to an AI system that can interpret and generate different types of data, such as text and images at the same time \u2014 called MM1. A report from those researchers said those new methods boast \u201csuperior abilities\u201d and can offer advanced reasoning and in-context learning to respond to text and images. In a press release on Tuesday, the company said WWDC 2024 will also share software updates coming to the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, Apple TV and Vision Pro headset.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/apple-annual-developers-conference-june-10/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "business"}}
