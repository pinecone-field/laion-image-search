US consumer prices fell in June\u00a0for the first time since the early months of the pandemic. Fresh data Thursday revealed that consumer prices dropped 0.1% from May. On an annual basis, inflation eased to 3% last month from 3.3% in May. The welcome slowdown in inflation has led investors to move up their bets for when the Federal Reserve could begin cutting interest rates. Wall Street\u2019s expectations for a September rate cut rose to roughly 93% on Thursday from 73% the day before, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. \u201cA September rate cut should be a done deal at this point,\u201d wrote Ron Temple, chief market strategist at Lazard, in a Thursday note. BNP Paribas economists on Thursday updated its base case to reflect a rate cut in September, citing the mix of June inflation and jobs data. They expect two quarter-point cuts in 2024. The Fed has a dual mandate: Keep prices stable and unemployment levels low. The central bank began hiking interest rates in 2022 to tame wayward inflation and has held them steady at the current 23-year high since last July. Thursday\u2019s data, coupled with a cooling but resilient labor market, is an encouraging sign that the Fed will be able to fulfill its dual mandate and begin easing sky-high rates in September. The US economy added 206,000 jobs in June, lower than a downwardly revised tally of 215,000 jobs in May, and the unemployment rate topped 4% for the first time since November 2021. New applications for unemployment benefits have also ticked higher in recent weeks. Fed Chair Jerome Powell didn\u2019t give hints about when the central bank could start cutting rates during his congressional testimony earlier this week. But he acknowledged that inflation has moderated and that the labor market is \u201cstrong, but not overheated\u201d \u2014 a departure from even just a few months ago, when inflation showed signs of reaccelerating and the jobs market remained red-hot. Still, the Fed will have to parse more data before its September meeting, which could alter its trajectory. Some economists worry that if the Fed doesn\u2019t cut rates by then, cracks could begin to deepen in the labor market. Some investors are concerned that the economy could weaken dangerously even before then. A September rate cut \u201cmay not be the magic elixir some investors are seeking,\u201d wrote Brent Schutte, chief investment officer at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management, in a Monday note. Prices fell in June for the first time since the start of the pandemic Americans weighed down by fast-rising prices for three years just received more encouraging news on the inflation front, reports my colleague Alicia Wallace. The Consumer Price Index, a measurement of the average change in prices for a commonly purchased basket of goods and services, dropped 0.1% from May, which helped to slow the annual rate of inflation to 3% from 3.3% in May, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 latest report. Falling gas prices as well as a drop in new and used car prices helped to usher in the first month-on-month decline since May 2020, BLS data showed. On an annual basis, consumer prices are increasing at their slowest pace since June 2023, matching the lowest annual rate since early 2021. Excluding energy and food prices, a closely watched \u201ccore\u201d index of underlying inflation also slowed more than expected. The core CPI rose 0.1% from May \u2014 its slowest pace since August 2021 \u2014 nudging the annual rate of core inflation lower, to 3.3% from 3.4%, and marking a fresh three-year low.

After rising prices turned customers off, the restaurants recently responded by unveiling value menus. For instance, McDonald\u2019s has a $5 value meal, which includes a McDouble cheeseburger or a McChicken sandwich, plus small french fries, 4-piece chicken nuggets and a small soft drink. At Taco Bell, you can now get two different kinds of tacos, a five-layer burrito, chips with nacho cheese sauces and a medium drink for $7. That\u2019s 55% cheaper than ordering the items individually. Like McDonald\u2019s, Burger King is offering a $5 meal bundle where customers can select one of three kinds of burgers to pair with chicken nuggets and a beverage. But just how much value is there in these kinds of \u201cvalue\u201d meals? Well, actually, not as much as you may think, since prices for many key ingredients used in value meals are coming down. In other words: You\u2019re paying the going rate (or more).

{"id": "2024_06_01_success_buying-house-in-retirement-mortgage", "text": "Moving somewhere new when you retire isn\u2019t uncommon. But deciding whether to take out a new mortgage to buy a home is a big deal. Much of your financial life is changing as you transition from a steady paycheck to a mix of fixed and variable income and a new lifestyle. So adding a large debt to the picture isn\u2019t an easy call. That\u2019s especially true now that mortgage rates hover around 7% and home prices keep rising. \u201cAny time you take on debt, you increase risk in your situation,\u201d said Illinois-based certified financial planner Jim Stork. More than a third (35%) of homebuyers last year were between the ages of 59 and 98, according to data from the National Association of Realtors. Within that group, a majority financed their purchases. Whether taking out a new mortgage makes sense for you depends on a lot of factors, including how to prove to a lender that you\u2019re a good credit risk, plus your feelings about the debt and the ongoing cost of maintaining a home. To get a mortgage, your age won\u2019t be a factor, but your income will be If you\u2019re concerned that you may be less attractive to a mortgage banker because you\u2019ve hit retirement age, know that it is illegal to discriminate against anyone applying for a mortgage based on their age. Lenders\u2019 chief focus will be on your ability to repay your mortgage with your various sources of non-paycheck income. \u201cWhen you qualify for a mortgage, it\u2019s all based on your income,\u201d said Melissa Cohn, regional vice president at William Raveis Mortgage. That, and of course any debt you have that will soak up your income, but we\u2019ll get to that in a minute. The income sources that lenders consider, absent a regular paycheck, include: Social Security benefits, pension or annuity income, spousal benefits, disability payments, interest and dividends and your 401(k) or IRA. If a portion of your income is not subject to tax, the lender may treat it as worth 25% more. Fannie Mae offers this example: Say 15% of a $1,500 monthly Social Security benefit is tax free. That means $225 of it will not be subject to tax ($1,500 x 15%). And 25% of that amount comes to $56 ($225 x 25%). So that $56 can be added to a person\u2019s qualifying Social Security income amount ($1,500 + $56 = $1,556). If you want to use your nest egg, different methods can be used to calculate how much income it would provide. There is the asset depletion method in which your eligible assets are divided by your loan term. In the case of a 30-year mortgage, that would be 360 months. If your IRA is worth $700,000, that translates into $1,944 per month ($700,000/360). \u201cYou don\u2019t ever have to take the money out \u2014 but you can use your assets [to qualify for a mortgage] as if you were going to take the distribution,\u201d Cohn said. Another option: If you are at least 59-1/2, you can start taking monthly distributions from an IRA without penalty \u2014 or a 401(k) if your plan rules permit \u2014 and the lender will count that as income so long as you show that you have sufficient funds in the account to keep taking that same monthly distribution for three years. Once you close on your home, Cohn said, you can reduce or stop taking distributions if you choose. That assumes you are not yet in your 70s when the IRS requires you to start taking minimum distributions, said Mark Luscombe, a principal analyst at Wolters, Kluwer Tax & Accounting. Burdened by debt? Lenders will also assess your debt-to-income ratio, because no matter how much income you have, the big question is how much of it will be consumed by your debts. The debt portion is composed of your expected mortgage payment plus any credit card, student loan, car loan or other outstanding debt you may have. Generally speaking, for conventional loans your DTI ratio can be up to 50%, Cohen said. That ratio falls to between 43% and 45% if you\u2019re taking out a jumbo loan, she added. A jumbo loan exceeds the conforming loan limits in the area you want to buy. But ideally your debt level will fall well below these top limits, both for the lender\u2019s sake and yours. And, of course, the higher your credit score, the better the interest rate you can get on a mortgage. What you should consider before taking out a mortgage Even before seeking a mortgage, get a good grasp on your expected monthly income and expenses in retirement. Compared to pre-retirement earnings, \u201cMost (new retirees) see a decrease in income,\u201d said certified financial planner Lori Trawinski, director of finance and employment at AARP. While some expenses may also decline \u2014 e.g., work-related costs like commuting \u2014 others may increase over time, Trawinski said, like medical costs, property taxes, home insurance and utilities. Of course, you can downsize and move to a lower-cost area. But if you stay near where you lived during your career, your expenses are likely to rise over time. Also, Trawinski noted, if you\u2019re married, consider what will happen to your household income when one spouse dies. This will help you assess your future comfort level in carrying a mortgage. \u201cPeople often fail to plan for the death of a spouse. You can take a big hit to your income when that happens,\u201d she said. If you do move to a new state or region, weigh renting first. You can get a better sense of the cost of living in the area and decide whether it\u2019s a good fit for you. As Stork put it, \u201cFlorida in August is not as fun as Florida in January.\u201d How much are you really willing to take on? All the usual financial decisions that go into homebuying apply no matter your age. But, in retirement especially, you don\u2019t want to take on more debt than necessary, since the cost of a mortgage is fixed, but the returns on your investments, the housing market and your health needs are variable. At the very least, Stork said, consider whether you can put enough money down \u2014 at least 20% \u2014 to avoid having to pay private mortgage insurance. Beyond that, consider whether you feel comfortable keeping up \u2014 and paying for \u2014 maintenance on a home. Maintenance might amount to 2% a year of your home\u2019s value, Stork said. That amounts to $10,000 a year on a $500,000 home. Maintenance is essential in preserving the value of your house should you ever decide to sell. How would your mortgage interest rate compare to a reasonable rate of return on your investments? The decision to get a mortgage was a lot easier for retirees when rates were historically low \u2014 roughly 3% \u2014 and their nest eggs were earning a lot more. \u201cBut at today\u2019s rates it\u2019s a much harder calculation,\u201d Stork said. This is especially the case if you\u2019re a very conservative investor. \u201cIf your CDs are earning 4% and a mortgage would cost you 7%, you will lose money every day on that decision,\u201d Stork explained. To get the truest reading on what makes financial sense, compare mortgage expenses to your investment returns on an after-tax basis, Stork noted.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/01/success/buying-house-in-retirement-mortgage/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_01_tech_meta-eu-competition-rules", "text": "Facebook parent Meta has been accused of breaking Europe\u2019s new digital competition rules over its \u201cpay or consent\u201d advertising model. Late last year, Meta (META)\u00a0launched\u00a0a service called \u201cSubscription for no ads,\u201d allowing European users of Facebook and Instagram to pay up to \u20ac12.99 ($14) a month for ad-free versions. The alternative is to accept versions with personalized ads. The European Commission said in a statement Monday that, in its preliminary view, \u201cthis binary choice forces users to consent to the (use) of their personal data and fails to provide them a less personalized but equivalent version of Meta\u2019s social networks.\u201d If the provisional findings of the Commission\u2019s investigation are confirmed, the EU could hit Meta with a fine equivalent to 10% of its global annual revenue under its landmark Digital Markets Act. Based on the company\u2019s 2023 results, that would amount to $13.5 billion. Meta said it didn\u2019t accept the Commission\u2019s findings. \u201c\u2019Subscription for no ads\u2019 follows the direction of the highest court in Europe and complies with the DMA,\u201d a spokesperson told CNN. \u201cWe look forward to further constructive dialogue with the European Commission to bring this investigation to a close.\u201d The EU announcement comes a week after the Commission accused Apple (AAPL) of breaching the DMA by preventing app developers from freely directing consumers to cheaper services. The regulators are also investigating Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) under the new law. The DMA, which came into force in March, requires dominant online platforms \u2014 so-called gatekeepers \u2014 to give users more choice, and rivals more opportunities to compete. Online platforms often collect personal data across their own and third-party services and use it in digital advertising services. Margrethe Vestager, a European Commissioner in charge of competition policy, noted in Monday\u2019s statement that Meta had been accumulating personal data of \u201cmillions of EU citizens over many years.\u201d \u201cWe want to empower citizens to be able to take control over their own data and choose a less personalized ads experience,\u201d she said. Michael Koenig, a senior official at the Commission, said Meta must offer users an alternative to \u201cfull\u201d ad personalization that \u201cdoes not rely on this personal data and which is then automatically less personalized and still available to them.\u201d \u201cThen Meta is free to keep a third option, which is a subscription not to see ads at all, or a fourth option which may have some premium features,\u201d he told journalists. The Commission is due to conclude its probe into Meta by late March next year.

{"id": "2024_07_03_tech_google-ai-greenhouse-gas-emissions-environmental-impact", "text": "As Google has rushed to incorporate artificial intelligence into its core products \u2014 with sometimes less-than-stellar results \u2014 a problem has been brewing behind the scenes: the systems needed to power its AI tools have vastly increased the company\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. AI systems need lots of computers to make them work. The data centers needed to run them, essentially warehouses full of powerful computing equipment, suck up tons of energy to process data and manage the heat all of those computers produce. The end result has been that Google\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions have soared 48% since 2019, according to the tech giant\u2019s annual environment report. The tech giant blamed that growth mainly on \u201cincreased data center energy consumption and supply chain emissions.\u201d Now, Google is calling its goal to reach net-zero emissions by 2030 \u201cextremely ambitious,\u201d and said the pledge is likely to be affected by \u201cthe uncertainty around the future environmental impact of AI, which is complex and difficult to predict.\u201d In other words: a sustainability push by the company \u2014 which once included the slogan \u201cdon\u2019t be evil\u201d in its code of conduct \u2014 has gotten more complicated thanks to AI. Google, like other tech rivals, has gone all-in on investing in AI, which is widely seen as the next major tech revolution that\u2019s poised to change how we live, work and consume information. The company has integrated its Gemini generative AI technology into some of its core products, including Search and Google Assistant, and CEO Sundar Pichai has called Google an \u201cAI-first company.\u201d But AI comes with a major downside: the power-hungry data centers that Google and other Big Tech rivals are currently spending tens of billions of dollars each quarter to expand in order to fuel their AI ambitions. Illustrating just how much more demanding AI models are than traditional computing systems, the International Energy Agency estimates that a Google search query requires 0.3 watt-hours of electricity on average, while a ChatGPT request typically consumes about 2.9 watt-hours. An October\u00a0study\u00a0from Dutch researcher Alex de Vries estimated that the \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d suggests Google\u2019s AI systems could eventually consume as much electricity as the country of Ireland each year, assuming a full-scale adoption of AI in their current hardware and software. \u201cAs we further integrate AI into our products, reducing emissions may be challenging due to increasing energy demands from the greater intensity of AI compute, and the emissions associated with the expected increases in our technical infrastructure investment,\u201d Google said in its report, published Monday. It added that data center electricity consumption is currently growing faster than it can bring carbon-free electricity sources online. Google said it expects its total greenhouse gas emissions to continue to rise before falling, as the company seeks to invest in clean energy sources, such as wind and geothermal energy, to power its data centers. The large amounts of water used as coolant needed to prevent data centers from overheating also presents a sustainability challenge. Google says it aims to replenish 120% of the freshwater it consumes in its offices and data centers by 2030; last year, it replenished just 18% of that water, although the amount was up sharply from 6% the year prior. Google is also among companies experimenting with ways to use AI to fight climate change. A 2019 Google DeepMind project, for example, trained an AI model on weather forecasts and historical wind turbine data to predict the availability of wind power, helping to increase the value of the renewable energy source for wind farmers. The company has also used AI to suggest more fuel-efficient routes to drivers using Google Maps. \u201cWe know that scaling AI and using it to accelerate climate action is just as crucial as addressing the environmental impact associated with it,\u201d Google said in the report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/tech/google-ai-greenhouse-gas-emissions-environmental-impact/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_04_23_cars_electric-vehicle-sales-forecast-iea", "text": "Global electric vehicle sales are set to rise by more than a fifth to reach 17 million this year, powered by drivers in China, according to the International Energy Agency. In a report Tuesday, the IEA projected that \u201csurging demand\u201d for EVs over the next decade was set \u201cto remake the global auto industry and significantly reduce oil consumption for road transport.\u201d It expects half of all cars sold globally to be electric by 2035, up from more than one in five this year, provided charging infrastructure keeps pace. The IEA includes battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid vehicles in its definition of EVs. The agency\u2019s bullish long-term outlook for EVs \u2014 based on current government policies \u2014 comes just days after the world\u2019s biggest battery EV maker Tesla slashed its prices in major markets to counter declining sales and growing competition from Chinese upstarts and established carmakers. Recent negative headlines about slowing EV penetration are out of step with positive global trends, according to IEA executive director Fatih Birol. The data \u201cdoes not at all show a reverse of the growth of electric cars. It shows an extremely robust increase of global electric car sales,\u201d he told reporters Tuesday. The growth is not driven just by Chinese buyers. The number of new battery electric cars sold in the European Union rose almost 4% in the first quarter of this year compared with the same period in 2023, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 Association. In a statement, Birol said: \u201cRather than tapering off, the global EV revolution appears to be gearing up for a new phase of growth.\u201d Despite the upbeat trends, EV makers are grappling with slim profit margins, squeezed by price wars as competition heats. In the past few days, Tesla and Chinese EV maker Li Auto have cut prices on major models in China, the world\u2019s biggest EV market, with Tesla also cutting prices in Germany and the United States. Earlier this month, Tesla posted its first annual drop in sales in nearly four years. The company\u2019s stock has plunged more than 40% so far this year. China\u2019s BYD has also stumbled after it briefly surpassed Tesla as global market leader, with its sales falling to about 300,000 in the first quarter from more than 525,000 in the final three months of 2023. Automakers may be hurting from the price cuts but they will be crucial to increasing the take-up of EVs around the world, according to the IEA, which emphasized that the \u201cpace of the transition to EVs\u2026 will hinge on affordability.\u201d In China, more than 60% of EVs sold last year were less expensive than conventional cars, but in Europe and the United States the purchase price for new cars with internal combustion engines remains lower on average. \u201cIntensifying market competition and improving battery technologies are expected to reduce (EV) prices in the coming years,\u201d the IEA said. \u201cGrowing electric car exports from Chinese automakers, which accounted for more than half of all electric car sales in 2023, could add to downward pressure on purchase prices,\u201d it added. Last year, Chinese carmakers accounted for more than half of global electric car sales, compared with their 10% share of the conventional car market. \u201cChina is the de facto leader of electric car manufacturing around the world,\u201d Birol said. Concerns about soaring imports of Chinese EVs prompted the European Union to open an investigation late last year into China\u2019s state support for EV makers. The auto industry is a major employer in Europe and crucial to the region\u2019s biggest economy, Germany, which is home to Volkswagen, Audi and BMW. EV sales in China will account for almost 60% of the global total this year and about 45% of all car sales in the country. By 2030, almost one in three cars on the roads in China is set to be electric, up from fewer than one in 10 last year, according to the IEA. That compares with its forecast for 17% in the United States and 18% in the European Union, compared with just over 2% and almost 4% respectively last year. \u201cThis shift will have major ramifications for both the auto industry and the energy sector,\u201d Birol said. The IEA sees global oil demand peaking in 2030, helped by the electrification of the transport sector. In addition to affordability, another barrier to mass adoption of electric cars is a lack of public charging infrastructure in Europe and the United States. Under current government policies, the number of public EV charging points worldwide is expected to reach 15 million by the end of the decade, a near-fourfold increase from last year, according to the IEA.

{"id": "2024_07_12_economy_banks-free-checking", "text": "Most banks offer free checking if, for instance, customers have their paycheck direct deposited or they maintain an average minimum balance. The majority of people with checking accounts (73%) take advantage of the option, according to a 2023 Bankrate.com survey. But if regulatory costs go up for banks, free services like checking may go away, at least if they follow Chase\u2019s lead. Marianne Lake, the head of Chase Bank, told the Wall Street Journal last week that Chase might stop offering free checking and other free banking services. \u201cConsumer banking is predicated on banks providing services for\u00a0free\u00a0to consumers such as\u00a0checking\u00a0accounts, debit cards and electronic bill paying. The model then relied on banks being able to recoup those costs elsewhere in the consumer banking business, such as with debit interchange fees, overdraft fees, late fees and higher interest rates,\u201d Jaret Seiberg, financial services analyst at TD Securities, wrote in an analysis of Lake\u2019s comments. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, for instance, has finalized a rule that caps credit card late fees at $8. However, it is not in effect yet because it is being litigated. The CFPB also has proposed that banks be limited in how much they can charge customers in overdraft fees. Separately, the Federal Reserve is expected to further limit how much banks can charge merchants when customers use their bank debit cards to make a purchase. While banks \u2014 especially smaller ones trying to attract deposits \u2014 may still have to offer incentives to bring in customers, one consumer advocate doesn\u2019t see customers running for the exits if their bank does in fact impose a fee on their checking account at some point in the next couple of years. Bank accounts can last longer than a marriage \u201cPeople tend to stick with their bank accounts \u2014 sometimes more than they stick with marriages,\u201d said Adam Rust, director of financial services at the Consumer Federation of America. Rust is kidding/not kidding, apparently. Bankrate found that the average US consumer has had the same checking account for nearly 18 years. The median duration of first marriages that end in divorce is eight years, at least the last time the Census Bureau checked, which was in 2009. The top three reasons people cited in Bankrate\u2019s survey for staying with their bank were: \u201cHappy with customer service,\u201d \u201cAlways had the account\u201d and \u201cConvenient branch or ATMs.\u201d Apart from those reasons, Rust suggests another factor that might dissuade people from changing banks for any reason: With automated bill payment options, the idea of disentangling yourself from Old Faithful might seem like more hassle than it\u2019s worth. He noted that you may have information on 10 to 20 service providers that you pay regularly embedded in your bank account records. So, if you were to switch banks, you might have to manually switch them all over. In any case, he added, paying a modest fee for your checking account might not be the worst thing. That\u2019s especially true if the reason your bank is tacking one on is because it will be limited in how much it can charge you for other things, like overdrafts. That\u2019s because upfront pricing is more transparent than being hit with higher, backend surprise fees. And it\u2019s not like you\u2019re not getting anything in exchange for a checking fee. \u201cA bank account is very useful,\u201d Rust said. The average overdraft fee was close to $27 last year, according to Bankrate, which noted some banks charge as much as $38. The average fee on interest-bearing checking accounts, meanwhile, was $15.33. And the average fee for noninterest-bearing checking accounts was just $5.31. Of course, if your money is with one of the largest retail banks in the country, such as Chase, you might skip the interest-bearing option altogether unless you have a high balance. That\u2019s because the average interest paid is around 0.01%, despite credit card rates being at record highs after the Fed embarked on a rate-hiking spree in the past two years to tame inflation. All that said, your free checking options might not disappear if a bank\u2019s regulatory costs don\u2019t change because there is too much pushback, or legal challenges prevail. Or, if those costs do rise, maybe some banks might decide for various reasons not to eliminate free checking. For instance, after passage in 2009 of the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act (CARD Act), which limited some fees and interest charges, the CFPB found in 2015 that \u201ctotal costs to consumers have fallen \u2026 and credit has generally become more available to consumers.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/12/economy/banks-free-checking/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "business"}}

And that has got to drive the Biden campaign absolutely nuts. Bidenomics worked and no one cares For the past three years, President Biden\u2019s biggest political liabilities have been painfully obvious: his age and inflation. One those problems has more or less evaporated \u2014 inflation has been steadily cooling, from 9% to 3% on annualized basis, for the past two years. Consumers are finally expressing some optimism, if not for the economy as a whole then at least for their own personal financial situations, the stock market and cooling inflation. Of course, everyone knows intellectually that the president doesn\u2019t control the economy. But that\u2019s never stopped voters from blaming whoever\u2019s in office for, well, just about anything, and similarly no party would miss an opportunity to claim credit for an economic boom. To be sure, American households aren\u2019t suddenly going to forget the whiplash of inflation that has strained their finances. It remains true, as my colleague Alicia Wallace notes, that overall prices are a good 20% higher than they were in February 2020. (In recent history, the index would typically rise about 10% over a 54-month period, Labor Department data shows.) And nothing in economics goes in a straight line. Just 24 hours after the jaw-dropping consumer price report, Friday brought some unexpected bad news around producer prices, which rose 0.2% in June after holding flat in May. Still, Thursday should have been a day for the White House to spike the football and double down on a message that has, historically, fallen flat \u2014 that Bidenomics is working. Unfortunately, if you\u2019re in the Biden camp, age \u2014 unlike inflation \u2014 only goes one direction. Rather than doing a victory lap, Biden on Thursday was preparing for a high-stakes news conference in front of a ravenous White House press corps that focused their questions almost entirely on his fitness to lead. During the press conference, he touted the inflation numbers repeatedly, comparing the positive economic situation now to the pandemic mess he inherited when he started the job. But the press\u2019 questions focused mostly on his verbal slipups and chances of beating former President Donald Trump. Bottom line: Thursday\u2019s inflation report is an indisputably positive development that could put some wind in the sails of a Democratic campaign \u2014 a powerful blow against the fictional Republican narrative about a US economy in the gutter. The White House can finally cross out \u201cinflation\u201d on its list of presidential liabilities. But as long as Biden\u2019s age dominates the conversation, it\u2019ll just be the econ nerds sipping Champagne alone.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/12/business/inflation-cpi-biden-nightcap/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "business"}}

Shoppers are also being squeezed by\u00a0higher prices at the grocery store, with food prices experiencing modest upticks last month, according to the newest inflation report. \u201cStop & Shop has evaluated its overall store portfolio and made the difficult decision to close underperforming stores to create a healthy base for the future growth of our brand,\u201d said the chain\u2019s president Gordon Reid in a release. Ahold Delhaize, the chain\u2019s Dutch parent company, revealed the locations Friday adding that they will close in early November. The closures come amid a broader shake up in the US grocery industry including the rise of low-cost grocery brand Aldi, which plans to open open 800 locations. In addition, Kroger and Albertson\u2019s announced plans for a $25 billion merger earlier this year. The Federal Trade Commission has sued to block it. Ahold Delhaize announced in May at its investor day that store reductions were planned, but didn\u2019t specify locations. The affected stores span all five states it has locations in, including 10 in New Jersey, eight in Massachusetts, seven in New York, five in Connecticut plus two locations in Rhode Island. Stop & Shop said it \u201cremains committed to serving its communities through other store locations, online shopping and home delivery services.\u201d Employees impacted by the closures will be offered other opportunities in the company. Following the closures, the 110-year-old chain said it will \u201ccontinue to have a strong presence across its five-state footprint with more than 350 stores.\u201d Stop & Shop has remodeled about half of its locations since 2018, with those refreshed stores \u201coutperforming\u201d the ones that haven\u2019t been updated.

{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl", "text": "Sam Altman has agreed to return to lead OpenAI, the company said in a Tuesday post on X, just days after his surprise ouster as chief executive sparked an employee revolt that threatened to undermine what has been the leading company in the fledgling artificial intelligence industry. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman wrote that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft, which is the ChatGPT maker\u2019s biggest financial backer. The announcement appears to bring to an end days of chaos for the AI industry that included negotiations over who should lead OpenAI and how the firm should be run, as well as broader discussions about just how fast the arms race to develop AI technology should be moving. The details of Altman\u2019s firing and re-hiring remain murky. In its announcement Friday, OpenAI claimed that Altman had been insufficiently \u201ccandid\u201d with the board. That ambiguous language sent the rumor mill flying. But a key factor in Altman\u2019s ouster was the presence of\u00a0tensions between Altman, who favored pushing AI development more aggressively, and members of the original OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the crisis. As of Monday morning, Nadella had announced that Altman, along with fellow OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, would be joining Microsoft to lead a new AI research division. OpenAI said it had hired former Twitch chief Emmett Shear as interim CEO. But then hundreds of OpenAI employees, nearly the company\u2019s entire staff, threatened to leave, potentially for Microsoft, if the company\u2019s board didn\u2019t resign and reinstate Altman as CEO. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it invested billions in to help bolster its ambitions in developing AI, which many in Silicon Valley think will be the most important wave of technological advancement in the coming decades. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Microsoft CEO\u00a0Satya Nadella said on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d Altman\u2019s vision to quickly roll out and commercialize AI tools also appears to have won out. Publicly, Altman has long cautioned about risks posed by AI, and he\u202fhas pledged to lawmakers and customers that he would move OpenAI forward responsibly. \u201cIs [AI] gonna be like the printing press that diffused knowledge, power and learning widely across the landscape that empowered ordinary, everyday individuals that led to greater flourishing, that led above all to greater liberty?\u201d he said in a May Senate subcommittee hearing pressing for regulation. \u201cOr is it gonna be more like the atom bomb \u2014 huge technological breakthrough, but the consequences (severe, terrible) continue to haunt us to this day?\u201d But inside the company, Altman had been pushing to bring products to market more quickly and to sell them for a profit. Altman announced a few weeks ago at OpenAI\u2019s first-ever developer day that the company would make tools available so anyone could create their own version of ChatGPT. OpenAI has also worked with Microsoft to roll out ChatGPT-like technology across Microsoft\u2019s products. OpenAI and iPhone designer Jony Ive had also reportedly\u202fbeen in talks to raise $1 billion from Japanese conglomerate SoftBank for an AI device to replace the smartphone. \u2014 CNN\u2019s Juliana Liu and Diksha Madhok contributed reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "trump-supporters-blame-media", "text": "Moments after\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0was rushed to safety following a failed assassination attempt at a Saturday night rally, some of his supporters turned toward the press pen with obscenities as they fingered reporters for blame. \u201cThis is your fault!\u201d one attendee emphatically yelled, pointing at individual journalists as he approached the fence line separating them from attendees. \u201cThis is your fault!\u201d \u201cIt is your fault!\u201d exclaimed another. Axios\u00a0reporter\u00a0Sophia\u00a0Cai, who quoted some in the crowd warning the press, \u201cyou\u2019re next\u201d and that their \u201ctime is coming,\u201d\u00a0even reported that\u00a0a few rally goers tried to breach the barriers establishing the press pen, but that they were stopped by security personnel. In the immediate wake of the horrific shooting attempt on Trump\u2019s life, which resulted in the tragic death of one rally attendee and the severe wounding of two others, the news media has quickly emerged among some Trump supporters as a body to assign blame. While the Trump campaign urged its staff to \u201ccondemn all forms of violence\u201d and said it \u201cwill not tolerate dangerous rhetoric on social media,\u201d some of the former president\u2019s supporters in\u00a0MAGA Media\u00a0vehemently assailed the press for its hard-knuckled reporting on Trump, which has sounded the alarm on what four more years under the former president would look like. Over the course of the campaign cycle, news organizations have, among other things, reported at length on Trump\u2019s plans to warp the federal government for his own ends, including to seek vengeance against his political opponents. That reporting is now facing scrutiny, with some Trump supporters blaming it for producing a charged atmosphere that gave way to the assassination attempt, while mostly looking past the incendiary rhetoric of the former president himself. Immediately after the attack, top figures across the news media condemned the shooting, underscoring that violence against a political candidate is an attack on democracy itself. Top liberal commentators also expressed their disgust in strong terms.\u00a0MSNBC\u2019s\u00a0Rachel Maddow, the country\u2019s most recognized liberal personality, said she did not \u201chave adequate words to describe how disgusted and horrified\u201d she was. \u201cThere is no *no* *no* *no* violent solution to any American political conflict,\u201d Maddow\u00a0wrote on Threads. \u201cI am grateful the former president is going to be ok, and miserably sad and angry about the other people hurt and killed. This is a very dark day.\u201d The reaction from the press and liberal media figures stood in stark contrast to how right-wing media personalities have responded in the aftermath of attacks on Democrats. Instead of raising the volume or fanning the flames of false flag conspiracy theories, which top figures on the right have done after attacks on\u00a0Paul Pelosi\u00a0and\u00a0Gabrielle Giffords, they urged for calm. Nevertheless, the anti-press attitude in MAGA circles has unquestionably increased. Despite the accuracy of the news media\u2019s reporting on Trump, supporters of the former president have moved to vilify and scapegoat journalists for the heinous attack, sending anti-media attitudes to alarming heights. \u201cOn a daily basis, MSNBC tells its audience that Trump is a threat to democracy, an authoritarian in waiting, and a would-be dictator if no one stops him,\u201d conservative radio host\u00a0Erick Erickson\u00a0wrote on X. \u201cWhat did they think would happen?\u201d Donald Trump Jr.\u00a0blasted\u00a0CNN,\u00a0The Washington Post, and the press at large for recent coverage of his father. \u201cDems and their friends in the media knew exactly what they were doing with the \u2018literally Hitler\u2019 bullshit!,\u201d he wrote on X. With just over 100 days until the November elections, the inflamed disposition toward the press has prompted cause for concern among news executives and spurred discussion inside newsrooms about safety and security precautions \u2014 especially with the\u00a0Republican National Convention\u00a0set to start on Monday. That four-day event, which was already a security concern prior to the assassination attempt, will bring together scores of journalists, alongside thousands of Trump supporters. \u201cJournalists are always among the very first to run towards a crisis, and we collectively are working in overdrive to keep everyone safe,\u201d one news executive told me. \u201cThat is the absolute top priority.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/trump-supporters-blame-media/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_03_tech_elevenlabs-ai-celebrity-voices", "text": "Actress Judy Garland never recorded her voice to read an audiobook of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, but you\u2019ll soon be able to hear her rendition of the children\u2019s novel that inspired the movie nonetheless. Earlier this week, AI company ElevenLabs said it is bringing digitally produced celebrity voice-overs of deceased actors, including Garland, James Dean and Burt Reynolds, to its newly launched Reader app. The company said the app takes articles, PDF, ePub, newsletters, e-books or any other text on your phone and turns it into voice-overs.  \u201cWe deeply respect their legacy and are honored to have their voices as part of our platform,\u201d said Dustin Blank, head of partnerships at ElevenLabs. \u201cAdding them to our growing list of narrators marks a major step forward in our mission of making content accessible in any language and voice.\u201d The company said it made deals with the estates of the actors whose voices are being used, but did not share details about compensation. The effort shows the potential of artificial intelligence for Hollywood but also sets a precedent for licensing and working with estates. It also comes at a time when the technology has grown by leaps and bounds, particularly in its ability to create images, text and sound, making it easy for anyone to create a version of someone\u2019s voice saying something they never did. That, in turn, has raised questions in creative industries such as journalism and film about how artificial intelligence can \u2014 or even should \u2014 be used. ElevenLabs previously made headlines earlier this year when its tool was reportedly used to create a fake robocall from President Joe Biden urging people not to vote in New Hampshire\u2019s presidential primary. Copyright questions and authenticity The partnership with the stars\u2019 estates comes two months after ChatGPT-maker OpenAI came under fire after introducing a synthetic voice that was eerily similar to Scarlett Johansson\u2019s character in the film \u201cHer.\u201d Johansson said in a statement shared with CNN that she was \u201cshocked, angered and in disbelief\u201d that the company would use her likeliness likeness after she turned down a partnership opportunity with OpenAI. Although a person can\u2019t copyright their own voice, it\u2019s possible to copyright a recording, according to David Gunkel, a professor at the department of communications at Northern Illinois University who tracks AI in media and entertainment. The AI is trained on old recordings and those recordings are under copyright. \u201cElevenLabs\u2019 new partnerships are all well within the realm of what the law allows,\u201d he said. \u201cAn estate will get a considerable amount of money from licensing and agreements. It\u2019s not unlike a company negotiating a copyright deal to use a popular song by Queen in an ad. The record company also could in theory say no, no matter how much money they\u2019re offered.\u201d Bern Elliot, a vice president and analyst at market research firm Gartner, said AI models can now be trained on fewer audio recordings; very little is needed to capture tone, speech patterns and other elements, whether it\u2019s for a celebrity or an everyday person. \u201cThe bigger concern is determining what the owner of those recordings can or can\u2019t do to monetize the voice,\u201d he said. Media companies are also ramping up their use of AI for voiceovers. Last week, NBC announced it is bringing an AI-version version of famed sportscaster Al Michaels back to the Olympics this summer, in daily recaps on its Peacock streaming platform. An NBC spokesperson told CNN that Michaels is being compensated for his involvement. It\u2019s unclear, however, how AI versions of well-known voices will be received by mass audiences and if it will raise concerns around authenticity. \u201cWe don\u2019t know yet the supposed market for these types of things but you can already see with audiobooks that ones read by recognizable voices and celebrities are a hot commodity,\u201d Gunkel said. \u201cIf there\u2019s a way to have a celebrity do all kinds of content and not voice it themselves, that could open up the market even wider.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/tech/elevenlabs-ai-celebrity-voices/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_11_economy_us-cpi-consumer-inflation-june", "text": "Americans weighed down by fast-rising prices for three years just received more encouraging news on the inflation front. The Consumer Price Index, a measurement of the average change in prices for a commonly purchased basket of goods and services, dropped 0.1% from May, which helped to slow the annual rate of inflation to 3% from 3.3% in May, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 latest report. Falling gas prices as well as a drop in new and used car prices helped to usher in the first month-on-month decline since May 2020, BLS data showed. On an annual basis, consumer prices are increasing at their slowest pace since June 2023, matching the lowest annual rate since early 2021. The better-than-expected inflation report further bolstered hopes that a Federal Reserve rate cut could come sooner than later and help make borrowing money less expensive. Interest rates have been planted for months at a 23-year high as a result of the central bank\u2019s inflation-fighting campaign. \u201cWith another good CPI print under their belt, the window is open for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates as early as September, and potentially again in December, assuming the inflation data continues to cooperate,\u201d Skyler Weinand, chief investment officer at Regan Capital, wrote Thursday in a note to clients. Economists were expecting a 0.1% monthly increase and an annual gain of 3.1%, according to FactSet consensus estimates. Excluding energy and food prices, a closely watched \u201ccore\u201d index of underlying inflation also slowed more than expected. The core CPI rose 0.1% from May \u2014 its slowest pace since August 2021 \u2014 nudging the annual rate of core inflation lower, to 3.3% from 3.4%, and marking a fresh three-year low. US stocks jumped on the news but quickly gave up those initial gains and settled lower. The blue-chip Dow\u00a0fell 90 points in morning trading. The S&P 500 dipped into negative territory and the tech-heavy Nasdaq was flat. US Treasury yields fell, which could be good news for consumers: Loans like mortgages are tied to the 10-year yield. Odds of Fed cutting are growing \u2014 but so are the risks Wall Street is growing increasingly confident that cooling inflation will allow the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates in the coming months. Investors are now pricing in an 89% chance of at least one rate cut by the September 17-18 Fed meeting, according to CME Group\u2019s\u00a0FedWatch Tool. That\u2019s up from 73% on Wednesday and around 50% a week ago. The Fed\u2019s calculus also has shifted somewhat, as the US labor market has become noticeably cooler, with unemployment ticking up for three months in a row to land at 4.1% in June. \u201cIt would be perfectly reasonable, in our opinion, to cut rates in July; however, the Fed is bound by its forward guidance and backward-looking mantra and won\u2019t move until September,\u201d Tuan Nguyen, economist at RSM US, told CNN in an interview on Thursday. \u201cAnything after that will put the economy at serious risk of hitting a hard landing.\u201d Shelter inflation eases While falling gas prices did a fair share of the heavy lifting in cooling inflation, the latest CPI showed progress in a critical area: Shelter. \u201cShelter\u00a0and services costs have been the longstanding and persistent trouble spots in the inflation readings, but maybe the tide is starting to turn,\u201d Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate, said in a statement. The shelter index rose just 0.2% during June, the slowest monthly increase in three years. On an annual basis, shelter-related price-hikes rose 5.2%, the coolest reading in two years but still running above overall inflation. Shelter inflation remains the biggest hurdle to CPI slowing (the category itself is about one-third of the overall CPI). Economists have anticipated a slowdown for quite some time now, as market-rate rents have slowed, but how they\u2019re recorded in the CPI comes with a significant lag, and tabulating overall housing cost inflation is an amorphous process of estimating the rental value of owner-occupied homes. Cheaper hotel and motel prices helped in the sharp cooling of the overall shelter index (they fell 2.5% for the month); however, rent and owners\u2019 equivalent rents both slowed on a monthly and annual basis. \u201cToday, the shelter component has finally caught up with what we have been predicting for more than a year now,\u201d RSM\u2019s Nguyen said. \u201cAnd that (moderation) should continue to be the case in the second half of the year.\u201d Retailers cutting prices for cost-wary consumers In recent months, a slew of major retailers have announced price cuts. That trend very well could continue as consumers become more restrained, House said. \u201cI think you have seen consumers feel and act increasingly strained, and that\u2019s going to make it harder for businesses to pass on prices as we moved throughout the year,\u201d Wells Fargo\u2019s House told CNN earlier this week. \u201c(Discounting) also pressures other retailers. If they want to keep their share of the pie, they\u2019re going to have to compete more on price, given that consumers are more squeezed at this stage of the cycle.\u201d Core goods prices fell on a monthly basis by 0.1% and are down 1.8% for the 12 months ended in June, according to Thursday\u2019s BLS report. Food prices saw a modest uptick last month, rising 0.2% overall with grocery and restaurant prices increasing 0.1% and 0.4%, respectively. Long-lasting effects of high inflation Prices may not be rising as quickly as they have been, but that might not bring much solace to American households who see that the overall CPI is a good 20% higher than it was in February 2020. (In recent history, that index would typically rise about 10% over a 54-month period, BLS data shows). The sticker shock of the past three years could leave a lasting impression on consumer behavior, said Michael Weber, an associate professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business who has studied how inflation surges affect consumer behavior. \u201cFor many consumers, when we look at the price tags, walking down the aisles of the supermarket, that price tag compared to two, three years ago will be permanently higher, given the cumulative inflation we\u2019ve witnessed over the last three years,\u201d Weber told CNN in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s ingrained in the memory,\u201d he added. The Fed closely monitors gauges of near-, medium- and long-term inflation expectations as those could be self-fulfilling prophecies for consumers: If people think prices will be higher in the future, they might spend more now or even demand higher wages. In turn, businesses faced with higher costs might end up raising prices as a result. While Americans\u2019 near-term inflation expectations have lessened, the fallout from high prices is being seen on a grander stage: The US presidential election. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t economists, they don\u2019t think like economists, they don\u2019t look at the rate of change in consumer prices \u2026 they\u2019re looking at how much a dozen eggs cost now compared to two years ago,\u201d Bernard Yaros, lead US economist at Oxford Economics, told CNN. \u201cThis is really where I think Biden has gotten dinged by, in terms of his public image of his handling of the economy.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/economy/us-cpi-consumer-inflation-june/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "business"}}

Filings show that the company took on about $325 million in debt following its purchase of Redbox in 2022 from private equity giant Apollo Global Management. The plan was to make it into an entertainment conglomerate, combining the DVD rental business with its free streaming services, like Crackle, the entertainment platform once owned by Sony.

But Trump appears to have escaped with mostly superficial injuries, and the market\u2019s thesis of the race hasn\u2019t changed: Trump remains the frontrunner to become the next president. A Trump win in November likely means the\u00a0preservation or expansion of tax cuts\u00a0and increased tariffs. During last month\u2019s presidential debate hosted by CNN, he reiterated his desire to impose a 10% tariff on all imports, which would likely increase inflation and cast doubt on interest rate cuts. Morgan Stanley research estimates that an expansion of the 2017 tax cuts would boost deficits sharply, sending the US dollar, which is already trading high, even higher. But it could also exacerbate America\u2019s inflation crisis, which has begun to show signs that it is ending. Monday also kicks off a big week of earnings, with reports from Goldman Sachs (GS) and BlackRock (BLK).", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/14/markets/premarket-stock-trading-trump-assassination/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_14_business_kei-trucks-japan-tiny-movement", "text": "Measuring about half the length of a Ford F-150, Kei trucks look almost like toys in comparison to your standard pickup truck. But for a car so tiny, you might be surprised at the massive following that they command. Kei trucks, built to satisfy Japanese light automobile regulations and known as \u201ckeitora\u201d (meaning \u201clight truck\u201d) in Japan, are vehicles that have been enjoying a surge in popularity in the automobile market. Sales of Kei trucks tripled in the last five years, with around 7,500 total imported just last year, according to data from Japan Used Motor Vehicle. Meanwhile, auto experts see the Kei truck craze as a pushback against big trucks by cash-strapped Americans as the average pickup size and average price tag skyrocketed post-pandemic, according to data from Cars.com. But the cult following of these mini trucks might be better measured by the ubiquity of online spaces that owners and enthusiasts have carved out for themselves. Instagram page Kei Trucks Appreciation Society (@keitrucksas) sells Kei truck-themed merchandise from hoodies to stickers and posts memes for its more than 95,000 followers. On X, Kei truck fans share pictures of mini trucks they spot in the wild. There is even a dedicated Reddit forum where over 23,000 members trade tips on truck maintenance and their experiences importing from Japan. But also common are discussions on the ever-changing legality of Kei trucks by state. While federal regulation allows the import of mini trucks so long as they are 25 years or older, state laws surrounding on-road use and registration are spotty. Most states lack Kei-specific regulation entirely, and so far, only 19 states allow Kei trucks on public roads. In New York, where laws are stricter, they can\u2019t be registered or titled. But despite limitations, demand for Kei trucks continues to grow. Here\u2019s what makes them so popular. Tiny but mighty On the practical end, Kei trucks combine utility and affordability. \u201cPeople want the functionality of a truck, but they don\u2019t want the size of it or to spend $60,000 on it,\u201d said George Zotos, owner and CEO of Kei truck brokerage company OIWA.co. Prices for the Ford F-150 Raptor, one of the line\u2019s higher-power models, start at $78,440. And the high-end 2024 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 High Country starts at $68,495. According to Zotos, the sticker price for Kei trucks sold in the can range anywhere from $500 to $6,000. Research by CNN shows that they can go for even more than that in good condition. Tetsu Ichino, owner of Japanese grocery store Maruichi in Rockville, Maryland, told CNN that he bought his Kei truck for $5,000. Adding shipping and taxes, his total came to $8,100. \u201cI was able to buy it with my credit card. I\u2019ve never bought a car with a credit card, so that was a first for me,\u201d he said. Ichino, a lifelong truck enthusiast, sold his full-size pickup Toyota Tundra in March because he didn\u2019t use it often enough but later missed the utility it provided. He told CNN that while he originally planned to buy another similarly sized truck, he found himself caught up in the Kei truck hype. The engine on Ichino\u2019s 1998 Honda Acty is smaller than that of a motorcycle, but he says it\u2019s still one of the most practical trucks out there. And in Maryland, where there are no Kei-specific rules, he mainly uses it for transporting supplies to his store. \u201cFor the majority of what I do, I will be able to do with the Kei truck,\u201d he said. According to Andrew O\u2019Bright, managing member of Japanese auto import company JDM Imports CT, most mini trucks have the same roughly 6-foot bed size as the F-150, Ford\u2019s full-size pickup truck line known for its towing capacity and powerful engine.   \u201cThey have the utility of an F-150 while getting 30 to 50 miles to the gallon on top of cheaper insurance, cheaper gas,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything about them tells consumers this is the way to go.\u201d Novelty factor But efficiency isn\u2019t the Kei truck\u2019s only point of appeal. Their unique, toy-like image also lends them a sense of novelty. \u201cIt is hard to quantify other than people just have a fascination with this micro vehicle,\u201d Zotos said. He also points to the truck\u2019s versatility as another reason why they appeal to such a wide demographic. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about people who are just turning 16 and getting their driver\u2019s license,\u201d he said. \u201cI had another customer in Chicago who got a truck just to wrap it for advertising.\u201d The cuteness factor of the Kei truck has proved advantageous for Melissa Torre, founder of Philadelphia-based soap and skincare company Vellum Street. As a small business owner, Torre is a regular at farmers markets where vendors are usually allotted a 10x10 space. To avoid the hassle of carting her merchandise back and forth between the parking area and the market lot, she began looking into trucks she could operate her business out of. But the milk vans and box trucks she originally considered were much longer, and she would need to buy two spaces to set up shop. In her research process, Torre came across Kei trucks, which run less than 11 feet in length. \u201cThey would fit exactly in the allotted space that I had been using. It was just a perfect transition without having to increase my cost,\u201d she said. \u201cI get to just pull up and set right up in the back of my truck. So it\u2019s made life a lot easier.\u201d She told CNN that she even spray-painted bubbles on her 1996 Daihatsu Hijet to match her company\u2019s branding. \u201cPeople who may not have stopped before to talk to me at markets will stop and talk about the truck. It\u2019s a driving billboard, but in a fun way,\u201d she said. \u201cKids love it. Adults love it. People are always surprised that I actually drove it there.\u201d Smaller and simpler But for all their popularity, auto experts don\u2019t see Kei trucks becoming mainstream. \u201cIt\u2019d be hard to imagine,\u201d said Mark Schirmer, director of corporate communications at Cox Automotive. He pointed to the failure of Mercedes\u2019 Smart brand in the US but their success in Japan as an example of smaller vehicles performing better in countries with smaller roads. Smart cars, small vehicles built with only two seats and minimal trunk space by Mercedes-Benz, were introduced in 2008 but exited the U.S. market in 2019 due to weak sales. \u201cI think Americans are just used to space,\u201d Schirmer added. And non-profit organizations like the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety have been vocal about their opposition to on-road use of mini trucks, citing concerns about the safety of low-speed vehicles. Still, he sees the popularity of more compact \u2013 if not quite small \u2013 truck models like the Ford Maverick and Hyundai Santa Cruz as a sign of Americans\u2019 appetite for a smaller truck segment. Whereas the Ford F-150 offers 5.5-foot, 6.5-foot and 8-foot bed options, the Maverick is only available in a 4.5-foot bed. But sales numbers hit 40,420 through the first half of 2024, according to data from Ford. And data from Edmunds showed that Americans were trading in more midsize and large pickup trucks for compact trucks than vice versa. Ivan Drury, Edmunds\u2019 director of Insights, says climbing costs for trucks, coupled with high interest rates, are at the heart of this shifting preference toward smaller trucks. \u201cI think people have always liked the utility of trucks, but unfortunately, when they found out that they liked trucks 10 years ago, the price just started going through the roof,\u201d he said. \u201cWith all the features and add-ons, you look at how much a truck has changed over the last 10 years, they\u2019re nothing like what they used to be.\u201d As competition within the auto industry heats up and automakers race to put out more advanced features, Drury says the popularity of smaller vehicles signals a desire for a return to simpler car models. \u201cThere\u2019s tons of technology,\u201d he said. \u201cAt some point, it\u2019s going to be too much and you turn away from it. You\u2019re like, \u201c\u2019I don\u2019t need all that.\u2019\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/14/business/kei-trucks-japan-tiny-movement/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_13_business_postage-rate-increase", "text": "On Sunday, the cost of a stamp is going up for the second time this year,\u00a0jumping 5 cents for first class postage to 73 cents. You probably didn\u2019t notice. And truthfully, you may not care. But you should. Most people don\u2019t use mail the way they used to \u2013 if they send out mail at all. But the price of postage is a big deal to millions of businesses and organizations that spend most of the $40.8 billion a year spent on mail, including letters, bulk mailings, junk mail and periodicals. And higher prices are making them cut back \u2013 and hurting the budget of the US Postal Service and, potentially, its ability to continue its crucial services. That includes everything from delivering online purchases to life-saving prescription drugs. And this year, tens of millions of voters will cast their ballots in the presidential election by mail. And, most of all, businesses still depend on the mail to help them reach customers and keep the economy going. Postage increases used to be pegged to inflation, usually going up at most once a year. But Sunday will mark the sixth increase in three years, during which first-class stamp increases rose 10 percentage points faster than overall inflation. Major mailers say hiking prices that quickly will drive them away from the post office, eventually drying up the agency\u2019s budget. \u201cWe think they\u2019ve overshot the mark on raising their rates,\u201d said Michael Plunkett, CEO of the Association for Postal Commerce, which represents companies in the mailing and shipping industry. \u201cThese rate increases aren\u2019t generating much additional revenue because it\u2019s driving volume out of the system that is likely never to return.\u201d The price of a first-class stamp reached 10 cents in 1974, just before the 200th anniversary of the service. As recently as 2002 it stood at 34 cents, or half of today\u2019s price ahead of Sunday\u2019s increase. So if raising the prices of stamps could ultimately endanger the postal service, why does the USPS keep hiking the costs to mail a letter? The short answer is because the agency needs money \u2013 badly. The long answer is more complicated. A history older than America The postal service and the United States have grown side by side since before the country\u2019s birth \u2013 quite literally. Founding Father Benjamin Franklin was appointed the first postmaster general in 1775,\u00a0the USPS notes on its website. The service expanded to keep pace with the new nation, and to help bind the young country together. It was a major reason roads were constructed between its early cities. US 1, the first federal highway, started out as Boston Post Road to carry mail between New York and Boston, and still goes by that name in many locations. \u201cWhen Alexis de Tocqueville toured the young country, in 1831, the United States boasted twice as many post offices as Britain and five times as many as France,\u201d\u00a0Smithsonian Magazine noted in October 2020. Today it has 640,000 employees located in over 30,000 facilities nationwide. Postage stamps, though, took quite awhile longer to make an appearance. \u201cAlexander M. Greig\u2019s City Despatch Post, a private New York City carrier, issued the first adhesive stamps in the United States on February 1, 1842,\u201d\u00a0according to the Postal Service. Congress then authorized\u00a0postage stamps in 1847, and prepayment of postage was required in 1855.\u00a0The iconic Pony Express\u00a0\u2013 a feature in many a Western film and novel \u2013 came about five years later, in 1860. And the postal service has made other appearances in pop culture and American history. The climax of beloved holiday movie \u201cMiracle on 34th Street\u201d has (spoiler alert) the Post Office rescuing Santa Claus on Christmas Eve. The characters of Cliff on the 1980s sitcom \u201cCheers\u201d and Newman in the 1990s sitcom \u201cSeinfeld,\u201d were letter carriers.\u00a0The band The Postal Service\u00a0was an indie-pop darling near the turn of the century. And the 1985 novel (by David Brin) and 1997 movie (starring Kevin Costner) \u201cThe Postman\u201d take the importance of delivering mail into a dystopian, sci-fi future. Mail down 75%, packages up But mail deliveries shriveled with the introduction of new ways to communicate and connect. Families and friends can communicate by email, text or apps. Bills can get paid electronically. Physical mail doesn\u2019t play the same role in American life that it used to. For many, the individual letter is as relevant today as VHS movies, floppy computer discs and cassette tapes. This century\u2019s nickname for the traditional letter - snail mail - is hardly a compliment. In its most recent year, the service delivered 11.4 billion individual letters. That may sound like a lot, but it\u2019s down 75% from 20 years ago. While stamp prices have doubled in that time, most experts point the finger at technology instead. \u201cFor most households, mail is not a significant expenditure,\u201d Plunkett said. \u201cIf the price of a stamp was a dollar I would send the same number of Christmas cards out later this year as I did last year.\u201d In contrast, online shopping has lifted package deliveries significantly. But the Postal Service doesn\u2019t have the lock on that business that it does in its mail service, said Kevin Kosar, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. \u201cBefore the digital age hit, the Postal Service had a very valuable monopoly. Those days are gone,\u201d he said. \u201cThe package business is going up, but that\u2019s not a monopoly business for them. It\u2019s very competitive.\u201d But Plunkett and other critics worry that the growth in the competitive package business will not produce the profits needed to make up for the declining mail volumes. The major mailers were never going to like the idea of paying more for postage. But they argue, with considerable evidence to back them up, that raising rates as rapidly as they have been climbing, is driving away business the service needs and worsening its economic condition. \u201cBy jacking the rates up, its efficiency and productivity go way down,\u201d said Art Sackler, executive director of the Coalition for a 21st Century Postal Service, another trade group representing business that use the service. \u201cLast year, by its own measure, its efficiency dropped by the most in 60 years.\u201d \u2018Financial death spiral\u2019 Critics are concerned about the rate increases: The worsening finances and efficiency could eventually force the Postal Service to run out of money, perhaps within a few years, and either start depending on direct taxpayer subsidies from Congress that it doesn\u2019t currently receive or cut back on staffing and service. The Postal Service under current Postmaster General Louis DeJoy laid out a 10-year plan in 2021 to modernize the service and stem ongoing losses. Before, he told the Senate in April, the USPS had been in \u201cfinancial death spiral\u201d for years, but that under the $40 billion modernization plan, \u201cwe are making the changes necessary to ensure that we are around to serve the country well into the future.\u201d But the plan, which includes restructuring its network of mail handling facilities, using more full-time staff, improving transportation and delivery methods and investing in technology, has not lived up to early promises. The service had projected it would break even by its last fiscal year and post a $1.7 billion annual profit in the current fiscal year. Instead, it lost $6 billion last year and is forecast to lose another $6 billion or more in the current fiscal year, according to congressional testimony in April from Michael Kubayanda, chairman of the rate-setting Postal Regulatory Commission. And some of the unions that represent postal workers are concerned the modernization plan will try to improve finances by reducing the reliability of the service. \u201cThe cost of a letter is still a heck of deal,\u201d said Mark Dimondstein, president of the American Postal Workers Union. \u201cI think there\u2019s good and I think there\u2019s bad in the plan. I think we do have to adapt to the world of growing package business and declining mail volumes. Our concern with the 10-year plan is anything that slows down service.\u201d Kubayanda testified in April that he doubts the modernization plan will be able to achieve its financial and service goals. \u201cIt looks increasingly difficult to have a universal postal system that reaches every American six days a week, at affordable prices, with reasonably fast and reliable service, and is self-sustaining financially,\u201d\u00a0he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/13/business/postage-rate-increase/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_01_tech_aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl", "text": "A London-based technology company is looking to \u201cdemocratize\u201d talent-identification and scouting in soccer using a mobile app. Free to download and available globally, the aiScout app allows aspiring soccer stars to enter virtual trials for professional clubs by uploading self-recorded footage of themselves completing a series of drills. It offers 75 exercises, designed to test a range of skills, with videos showing users how to complete them. Performances are automatically scored by artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The data can then be accessed by clubs, allowing their scouts to peruse scores for viable talent, honing their search with a variety of filters; from age and gender to position on the pitch. The app currently has two English Premier League (EPL) partners, Chelsea and Burnley, and clubs can tailor their in-app trials to meet specific needs and set their own benchmarks by having their academy players complete the same drills. \u201cWe\u2019re putting that data up front to make better use of [the scouts\u2019] time,\u201d said Richard Felton-Thomas, chief operating officer of ai.io, the company behind the app. \u201cTo say [to scouts], \u2018Go over to this place today because there\u2019s three players in that game that are all actually beating your Chelsea standard\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s going to be the best use of your time.\u2019\u201d It already appears to be working for some. Ben Greenwood had never had a trial with a professional club until he downloaded the app in 2019. After uploading footage of himself, the 17-year-old landed a trial with Chelsea, becoming the first user of the app to get a trial with a pro club. He signed a contract\u00a0with EPL team Bournemouth\u00a0in 2021. \u2018It\u2019s more about evolution\u2019 Having beta-tested in with players spanning 125 countries, Greenwood among them, 135 players have been trialed or signed by pro clubs or national teams through the app \u2014 which fully launched in September 2023 \u2014 according to Felton-Thomas. Just over 100,000 players make up the current database, but with over 100 clubs lined up to join Chelsea and Burnley, as well as a multi-year partnership with Major League Soccer in the US announced last May, Felton-Thomas projects user numbers to surge into the millions as the operation ramps up this year. Felton-Thomas said the \u201clion\u2019s share\u201d of its income comes from charging clubs a license fee to run the platform. Annual fees vary depending on the size of the club and the tools they require, ranging from six figures for \u201ctier one\u201d sides like Chelsea, to thousands of pounds for clubs lower down the footballing pyramid. The use of smart technology in sport continues to expand, including\u00a0AI commentary tools and wearable tech for elite athletes. The global market for sports analytics, valued at\u00a0$2.7 billion\u00a0in 2023, is projected to grow 22% by the end of the decade, according to market research firm Grand View Research. Should soccer talent scouts be concerned about being edged out by the arrival of AI in their industry? For Felton-Thomas, new technologies can co-exist with traditional methods. \u201cIt\u2019s more about evolution than revolution,\u201d Felton-Thomas explained. \u201cWe can\u2019t tell you when that player\u2019s actually in that match, how does he deal with adversity? What happens when he\u2019s 2-0 down? What happens when someone\u2019s shouting at him? What happens when he\u2019s just made a massive mistake?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got the ability to just augment real people to do their jobs better and faster, which then gives an opportunity to the player through the AI, but you\u2019re still actually just connecting them to the human on the other side, which is the club and the scout.\u201d While football remains ai.io\u2019s primary focus, the company is looking into opportunities in other sports to launch in the coming years. Further ahead, it may branch out beyond sports. \u201cYou think about the notion that you can be at home and analyze your movements, and how this could spin into health care, physical assessments for military disciplines and emergency services,\u201d Felton-Thomas told CNN.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/01/tech/aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_13_business_boeing-slap-on-wrist", "text": "Boeing faces up to $487 million in fines as part of its anticipated guilty plea to a felony charge related to two fatal crashes of the 737 Max. Critics of the deal, however, are calling it a \u201cslap on the wrist.\u201d While corporate guilty pleas by companies the size of Boeing are rare, and there are some terms of the plea agreement that Boeing leadership undoubtedly found onerous, the deal does show the limits of corporate criminal charges. Boeing agreed to plead guilty to a charge that it defrauded the Federal Aviation Administration, hiding crucial information about a design flaw on the 737 Max during its original certification process. That design flaw has been tied to crashes in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people, plunging the company into a crisis that led to $32 billion in losses. \u201cThe Justice Department does no one any favors by trying to sell this as a tough deal,\u201d said Peter Goeltz, a former managing director of the National Transportation Safety Board and now a CNN contributor who consults for transportation companies. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t smell like a tough deal.\u201d Under the plea settlement reached late Sunday, a $243 million fine that Boeing agreed to pay back in 2021 could be doubled to $487 million. \u201cThat\u2019s what, the price of three 777\u2019s?\u201d Goeltz said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure that it\u2019s a significant fine.\u201d There are some other numbers backing Goeltz up. Before the losses started in 2019, the company was reporting record annual revenue of $101 billion and record core operating profit of $10.7 billion, or 21 times the cost of of the $487 million fine. While Boeing\u2019s credit rating is now at risk of falling into the junk bond status for the first time, credit rating agency Moody\u2019s came out with a statement Monday that the plea and penalties \u201cwill have little effect on Boeing\u2019s finances or operations.\u201d And Boeing nearly escaped even this slap on the wrist. In January a door plug blew off a 737 Max approaching 16,000 feet. While no one was killed or seriously injured on that Alaska Airlines flight, the incident not only brought unwanted attention and a slew of federal investigations, it upended an agreement Boeing reached in January 2021 with the Justice Department to end the risk of prosecution for defrauding the FAA during the Max certification. The Alaska Air incident happened just days before the probationary period would have ended. Getting off cheap The expected guilty plea did little to satisfy family members of the crash victims,\u00a0who branded it a \u201csweetheart deal,\u201d an \u201catrocious abomination\u201d and a gross \u201cmiscarriage of justice.\u201d Their attorneys had argued that Boeing should have been hit with a maximum fine worth as much as $24.8 billion, which they calculated based on a multiple of their estimate of combined losses sustained by the families. Other corporations that pleaded guilty to felonies have agreed to much larger fines. Oil giant\u00a0BP agreed to pay $4 billion\u00a0to settle criminal charges, including manslaughter, related to the explosion and oil spill at its Deepwater Horizon oil platform in 2010 that killed 11 workers. Volkswagen pleaded guilty to three US felony criminal charges and agreed to\u00a0pay $2.8 billion in criminal penalties in 2017 after it admitted to cheating on its diesel emissions tests. \u201cThe fact that this is in the millions of dollars rather than billions is an indication this is a slap on the wrist,\u201d said Paul Cassell, a University of Utah law professor who worked on the BP case on behalf of victims and is now working for the families in the Boeing crashes. One of the facts angering family members is that Boeing agreed to plead guilty to simply defrauding the FAA, rather than facing manslaughter charges for the deaths of hundreds of people. \u201cThat\u2019s a tougher case to prove, but I believe the evidence was there,\u201d said Mark Lindquist, another attorney representing family members, as well as some passengers aboard the Alaska Air flight. \u201cAs a practical matter, the result might not have been a lot different\u201d if there had been manslaughter rather than fraud charges in this criminal case, Lindquist said. \u201cFrom a philosophical basis, it would have felt more like accountability and justice for the victims\u2019 families.\u201d Why no executives are facing charges But while the Justice Department announced in January of 2021 that \u201cmisleading statements, half-truths, and omissions communicated by Boeing employees to the FAA\u201d played a direct role in the crashes, it has taken only limited criminal action against any individual employee, and none against the top executives who oversaw the company\u2019s decisions at that time. The Justice Department said in a press statement early Monday that the agreement included \u201cno immunity to any individual employees, including corporate executives, for any conduct.\u201d But of the two former Boeing employees cited in the original settlement of the case in 2021, only one, Mark Forkner, the chief technical pilot at Boeing at the time, ever faced criminal charges, and he was eventually acquitted after his attorney convinced the jury that he was being made a scapegoat. \u201cAs a practical matter, individuals are more sympathetic to jurors than companies,\u201d Lindquist said. \u201cDOJ made a prosecutorial decision to pursue the company rather than individuals.\u201d There are also defenses in an individual\u2019s criminal case that are not possible in a corporate criminal case. \u201cWith an individual, there\u2019s always someone else he or she can point the finger at,\u201d said Lindquist. Boeing attorneys had it as part of their mission to make sure that its executives did not face any criminal charges, Lindquist said. \u201cFrom the beginning, that\u2019s been clear,\u201d he said. A Boeing spokesman said the company had no comment about the anticipated guilty plea or the case beyond a brief statement confirming the agreement. Another way to make executives pay Even if there are no criminal charges brought against executives, they can face significant penalties, Arlen said. That could come in the form of \u201cclawbacks,\u201d in which Boeing demands executives return bonuses they received during the time the misconduct was committed. \u201cEnsuring that the individuals are held accountable is the most important thing,\u201d she said. But so far the Boeing board has shown little indication of wanting to hold executives financially responsible. It recently gave CEO Dave Calhoun a 45% raise, taking his pay from $22.6 million to $32.8 million for 2023. His predecessor, Dennis Muilenburg, lost the CEO job at the end of 2019 without any severance but left the company with a package of stock worth about $80 million at that time. Asked about possible clawbacks, Boeing pointed to company policy, which states in part: \u201cThe board shall have the discretion\u2026 to recover incentive-based compensation paid to any executive of the company who has engaged in fraud, bribery, or illegal acts\u2026 or knowingly failed to report such acts of an employee over whom such officer had direct supervisory responsibility.\u201d But despite that language, no clawbacks have occurred. Arlen said it would also be justified for compensation for board members to be clawed back. While Calhoun was not an executive during this time, he was on the Boeing board, receiving more than $300,000 a year while the certification process for the Max was taking place. \u201cAt the end of the day, when you have a company with systemic problems, the ultimate buck stops with the board,\u201d she said. Why Boeing will keep its government contracts The most serious penalty that Boeing could face is by far the least likely \u2013 it could be barred from federal government contracts due to its guilty plea. And that could conceivably force the company out of business: US government contracts accounted for 37% of its revenue in 2023, or about $29 billion, according to company filings. But while it will need to get waivers from the government to continue its contracts, everyone expects those waivers will be granted. Most of those contracts are with Boeing\u2019s defense and space business, not its commercial aircraft unit. Asked about the Department of Defense contracts, Pentagon spokesperson Air Force Major General Patrick Ryder told reporters Monday that \u201cDOD will assess the company\u2019s remediation plans and agreement with the Department of Justice to make a determination as to what steps are necessary and appropriate to protect the federal government.\u201d But the US government has few alternatives than sticking with Boeing, despite both the expected guilty plea and the years of quality issues. Beyond the lack of alternatives, few if any decision makers in the federal government want to see Boeing go out of business. It remains the nation\u2019s largest exporter, and has nearly 150,000 US employees. The company estimates its economic impact at $79 billion, supporting 1.6 million direct and indirect jobs at more than 9,900 suppliers spread across all 50 states. And it is crucial to the smooth operation of the nation\u2019s air travel system. \u201cIt\u2019s very clear to me Boeing is going survive this,\u201d said Robert Clifford, another lawyer for family members of crash victims. \u201cWhy is Boeing getting a pass that other criminal defendants do not? Because they\u2019re Boeing.\u201d \u2013 CNN\u2019s Natasha Bertrand contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/13/business/boeing-slap-on-wrist/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "business"}}

That\u2019s the shared vision of NASA and Nokia, who have partnered to set up a cellular network on the Moon to help lay the building blocks for long-term human presence on other planets. A SpaceX rocket is due to launch this year \u2014 the exact date has yet to be confirmed \u2014 carrying a simple 4G network to the Moon. The lander will install the system at the Moon\u2019s south pole and then it will be remotely controlled from Earth. \u201cThe first challenge to getting a network up and running is having a space-qualified cellular equipment that meets the appropriate size, weight, and power requirements, as well as being deployed without a technician,\u201d Walt Engelund, deputy associate administrator for programs at NASA\u2019s Space Technology Mission Directorate, told CNN. No less of a challenge, it will need to operate in the harsh lunar environment of extreme temperatures and radiation. The 4G network unit is being built by Nokia\u2019s Bell Labs using a range of off-the-shelf commercial components. It will be loaded onto a lander made by US company Intuitive Machines, and once deployed it will connect the lander via radio equipment to two roaming vehicles with their own special mission: to search for ice. One of the vehicles, the Lunar Outpost rover, will explore the area known as Shackleton Connecting Ridge, while the other, the Micro-Nova hopper, will plunge into a crater to scan for unprecedented up-close evidence of Moon ice. Images of ice \u2014 transmitted back to the lander and then Earth in near real-time via the cellular network \u2014 would be a world-first. Lunar ice could be used to create breathable oxygen, and even fuel that could eventually be used to launch Mars missions from the Moon. For NASA\u2019s Artemis program, which aims to return astronauts to the moon this decade, cellular connectivity is invaluable. Currently, astronauts talk to each other by radio, but NASA wants a lunar communications system capable of supporting high-resolution video and science data, said Engelund \u2014 especially as Artemis missions become more sophisticated. \u201cBeing able to communicate on the Moon is critical to Artemis \u2014 as critical as any other mission element like power, water to drink, and air to breathe,\u201d said Engelund. \u201cEventually, this effort will help establish a lunar communications network that could give our explorers the ability to beam scientific data back, confer with mission control, and talk to their families, as if they were walking down the street on their cellphones.\u201d It could lay the groundwork for an off-world internet not dissimilar to that of Earth\u2019s. Personal devices could connect to such networks, allowing \ufeffspace colonists to use smartphones that can access all the apps and services available to those back on Earth. NASA selected Bell Labs as part of its Tipping Point initiative, a series of partnerships with companies to develop technologies for future missions that puts them in prime position for key roles in the future space economy. Bell Labs was given a $14.1 million grant in 2020, and in January, Nokia was selected by the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to begin working on a communications services infrastructure that will eventually serve as the \u201cframework for the lunar economy.\u201d \u201cA future lunar economy will critically depend on communication technologies to collect and analyze data, share information, and maintain and control operations,\u201d Thierry Klein, president of Bell Labs Solutions Research, told CNN. \u201cThis includes sustaining a semi-permanent or permanent human presence on the Moon, as well as automated robotic operations for transportation, resource mining, mineral processing and scientific data collection.\u201d There are potential commercial benefits for Earthly business ventures too. If a network can withstand the journey into orbit, then deploy and endure autonomously amid the vacuum of space, wildly fluctuating temperatures and cosmic radiation, it will be able to survive the harshest locations on Earth \u2014 such as polar ice caps, deserts, or offshore platforms. \u201cEspecially when it comes to remote deployments, industrial sites, public safety, emergency response, disaster recovery or defense, it is highly beneficial to have compact, low-footprint network equipment that can be easily transported and deployed anywhere,\u201d Klein said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/24/tech/nokia-moon-4g-network-nasa-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_12_business_att-customers-massive-breach", "text": "The call and text message records from mid-to-late 2022 of tens of millions of AT&T cellphone customers and many non-AT&T customers were exposed in a massive data breach, the telecom company revealed Friday. AT&T said the compromised data includes the telephone numbers of \u201cnearly all\u201d of its cellular customers and the customers of wireless providers that use its network between May 1, 2022 and October 31, 2022. The stolen logs also contain a record of every number AT&T customers called or texted \u2013 including customers of other wireless networks \u2013 the number of times they interacted, and the call duration. Importantly, AT&T said the stolen data did not include the contents of calls and text messages nor the time of those communications. The records of a \u201cvery small number\u201d of customers from January 2, 2023, were also implicated, AT&T said. \u201cWe have an ongoing investigation into the AT&T breach and we\u2019re coordinating with our law enforcement partners,\u201d the FCC said on social media platform X. The company\u00a0blamed\u00a0an \u201cillegal download\u201d on a third-party cloud platform that it learned about in April \u2013 just as the company was grappling with an\u00a0unrelated major data leak. AT&T says that the exposed data is not believed to be publicly available, however CNN was unable to independently verify that assertion. AT&T spokesperson Alex Byers told CNN that this was an entirely new incident that had \u201cno connection in any way\u201d to another incident disclosed in March. At that time, AT&T said personal information such as Social Security numbers on 73 million current and former customers was released onto the dark web. \u201cWe sincerely regret this incident occurred and remain committed to protecting the information in our care,\u201d the company said in a statement about the latest breach. AT&T listed approximately 110 million wireless subscribers as of the end of 2022. AT&T said international calls were not included in the stolen data, with the exception of calls to Canada. The breach also included AT&T landline customers who interacted with those cell numbers. AT&T said that contents of the calls or texts, personal information such as Social Security numbers, dates of birth, or customer names were not exposed in this incident, however the company acknowledged that publicly available tools can often link names with specific phone numbers. Additionally, AT&T said that for an undisclosed subset of its records, one or more cell site identification numbers linked to the calls and texts were also exposed. Such data could reveal the broad geographic location of one or more of the parties. AT&T believes that at least one person involved in the cybercriminal incident is in custody, the company said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The FBI declined to comment when asked about that statement. AT&T promised to notify current and former customers whose information was involved and provide them resources to protect their information. Usage details such as the time of calls and text messages were not compromised either. But AT&T spokesperson Byers told CNN that the number of calls and text messages, and total call durations for specific days or months were exposed. That means the data would not identify precisely when one phone number called another but could reveal how often two parties called each other \u2013 and how long they spoke for \u2013 on specific days. AT&T said it learned on April 19 that a \u201cthreat actor claimed to have unlawfully accessed and copied AT&T call logs.\u201d The company said it \u201cimmediately\u201d hired experts and a subsequent investigation determined hackers had exfiltrated files between April 14 and April 25. Justice Department delays public disclosure The company said the US Department of Justice Department determined in May and in June that a delay in public disclosure was warranted. The FBI said AT&T reached out shortly after learning about the hack, but the agency wanted to review the data for potential national security or public safety risks. \u201cIn assessing the nature of the breach, all parties discussed a potential delay to public reporting\u2026 due to potential risks to national security and/or public safety,\u201d the FBI said in a statement. \u201cAT&T, FBI, and DOJ worked collaboratively through the first and second delay process, all while sharing key threat intelligence to bolster FBI investigative equities and to assist AT&T\u2019s incident response work.\u201d This appears to be the first cyber incident in which the Justice Department has asked a company to delay filing a disclosure with the SEC because of potential national security or public safety concerns. \u201cThis is very concerning. This information is very valuable to cyber criminals and to nation-states,\u201d Sanaz Yashar, co-founder and CEO of cybersecurity firm Zafran, told CNN. Yashar, previously an Israeli cyber spy, said threat actors can correlate the cell ID data with other information readily available to pinpoint where someone works \u2013 including at sensitive locations like the White House and Pentagon. \u201cYou don\u2019t need the timestamp. If someone is there everyday, you can understand they work there and their routine. This is very secret information and a way that spies do stuff.\u201d Justin Sherman, founder of Global Cyber Strategies, a consultancy, also put the potential threat in stark terms. \u201cMetadata about who\u2019s communicating with who, at massive scale, enables someone to map connections between people \u2014 think journalists and sources, intelligence officers and their contacts, married people and those with whom they\u2019re having an affair,\u201d Sherman told CNN. Jason Hogg, a former FBI special agent who is now executive-in-residence at Great Hill Partners, said the cell site data is \u201cquite significant because it could allow bad actors to determine certain consumers\u2019 geolocation, which could be used to make the social engineering attacks more believable.\u201d AT&T shares fell 1% on Friday following the news. In the new incident, AT&T told CNN it learned in April that customer data was illegally downloaded from its workspace on Snowflake, a third-party cloud platform. AT&T is only the latest major company to have data stolen via access to their Snowflake platform. Ticketmaster and Santander Bank have also recently disclosed massive data breaches linked to Snowflake. Mandiant, a Google-owned cybersecurity firm, has notified at least 165 organizations that they may have been affected by the hacking spree. Mandiant analysts said they have \u201cmoderate confidence\u201d that the hackers are based in North America and that they collaborate with an additional person in Turkey. Brad Jones, chief information security officer at Snowflake, told CNN in a separate statement that the company has not found evidence this activity was \u201ccaused by a vulnerability, misconfiguration or breach of Snowflake\u2019s platform.\u201d Jones said this has been verified by investigations by third-party cybersecurity experts at Mandiant and CrowdStrike. AT&T said it launched an investigation, hired cybersecurity experts and took steps to close the \u201cillegal access point.\u201d This story has been updated with additional context and developments.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/12/business/att-customers-massive-breach/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "business"}}

And one of those was to replace the plane that saw a door plug blow out mid-flight just over six months ago. It sold just three 737 Max jets, two to an unidentified customer and one to Alaska Airlines to replace the plane that had a door plug blow out on a January 5 flight as it approached 16,000 feet. The other 11 jets were 777 freighters. It marked one of its best sales months of the year, but it still ended the first half of 2024 with gross sales down 70% from a year ago. The 14 gross sales are up from the only four sold in May and seven in April. But it\u2019s down 95% from the 304 gross orders it took in in June of 2023. Boeing\u2019s sales have fallen sharply in the wake of the Alaska Air incident, as even airlines eager to expand their fleets hold off on purchases while Boeing works through a myriad of problems. It had come into the year with a record sales month in December, but sales ground to a virtual halt following the Alaska Air incident. The one strong sales month it reported was in March, when it sold 113 planes. Most of that came from an order of 85 jets from American Airlines. But that order was for a longer version of the 737 Max, which the Federal Aviation Administration has not even certified to carry passengers as of yet. That certification, originally expected this year, has been pushed back to at least 2025 by the problems brought to light by the Alaska Air incident. The company agreed Sunday to plead guilty to its employees defrauding the FAA during the original certification process for the 737 Max. It could face further criminal charges related to the Alaska Air incident. The plane it sold to Alaska Air is also a 737 Max 10 to replace the plane that lost the door plug in January. Boeing agreed to repurchase that specific plane, which was able to land without serious injury for crew or passenger.

What\u2019s at risk Hackers did not get any names, addresses or Social Security numbers. What they did get is metadata \u2014 call logs that contain a record of every number AT&T customers called or texted (including customers of other wireless networks), the number of times they interacted and the call duration. A cybercriminal could now identify relationships among phone numbers, a useful data point for hackers trying to make their scams more believable. For example, a hacker could see that a customer is in constant contact with a big bank\u2019s line and could send a phishing attempt posing as the bank. The hacker could text the customer saying, \u201cThis is Bank of America. We have some suspicious activity on your account. Click this link to review the charges, or call this number,\u201d said John Dwyer, director of security research at Binary Defense, a cybersecurity solutions firm. Or the hacker could pose as someone the customer has a personal relationship with, like a friend or family member. The age of artificial intelligence makes this even more pressing, according to Collin Walke, cybersecurity and data privacy partner at Hall Estill. \u201cOnce they know who you\u2019ve been communicating with, it allows deep fakes and those sorts of hacks to occur much easier,\u201d Walke said. Some customers\u2019 cell tower ID numbers were also exposed, which could help some bad actors track down geolocations, Walke said. That could also make these hacking attempts more believable. What customers should do Cellphone users should always be careful about phishing and other scam attempts, especially as hackers become more and more sophisticated. But AT&T customers should be hypersensitive to phone calls and text messages where they\u2019re being asked to do things like call a number, click a link or transfer money. That includes requests from what appears to be a number that you normally communicate with, Dwyer said. \u201cIf someone calls or texts you and asks you to do something, make sure you call them back to verify that it\u2019s actually them,\u201d Dwyer said. Of course, without stricter cybersecurity regulation, there isn\u2019t much customers can do to protect against data breaches. That responsibility lies with the federal government and giant telecom companies, which experts say widely go unchecked. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should have an expectation that everyday Americans should be on the front lines of defending themselves for making sure the businesses they interact with have mandatory minimum cybersecurity in place,\u201d Eric Noonan, CEO of cybersecurity provider CyberSheath said.

She denies wrongdoing in both cases. Lawyers for Dominion told a judge Monday that the defamation case should move forward and that they can tailor document requests and deposition questions to steer clear of the specific Arizona allegations. \u201cAny deposition of Ms. Bobb, could and likely would impair Ms. Bobb\u2019s Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, extend criminal discovery beyond the limits set forth by Arizona law, potentially expose Ms. Bobb\u2019s theory to the prosecution in advance of trial, and otherwise prejudice her criminal case,\u201d Bobb\u2019s criminal attorney in the Arizona case, Thomas Jacobs, said in a past court filing.

The Ambanis have set a new benchmark for big, fat Indian weddings, which are bound to grow bigger and louder than ever before as the number of the ultra-rich swells in the world\u2019s fastest-growing major economy. \u201cThe Ambani wedding parties have \u2026 had a multi-faceted impact on the wedding industry in India, influencing trends, boosting demand for wedding vendors, promoting cultural heritage and even driving economic growth,\u201d Tim Chi, CEO of The Knot Worldwide,\u00a0a wedding planning service,\u00a0told CNN. The Indian wedding industry has boomed since the country emerged from the pandemic. Estimated at about $130 billion, it\u2019s now nearly twice the size of America\u2019s, although still smaller than that of China\u2019s, according to a report by Jefferies last month. The industry plays a major role in boosting sectors such as fashion and travel. \u201cAn otherwise value-conscious society, Indians love to spend on weddings,\u201d Jefferies said. \u201cAnd this is irrespective of the economic classes.\u201d At about $15,000, the average Indian wedding costs more than\u00a0three\u00a0times the average annual household income. More than a status symbol Weddings can be expensive affairs in any country, but in India they are especially important as symbols of power and status. Parents in South Asia typically spend a significant portion of their lifetime savings on their children\u2019s weddings, but the scale of many of these events has now become gargantuan, coinciding with India\u2019s rise as an economic powerhouse. \u201cIn the last decade there has been a big shift in Indian weddings across the board,\u201d said Sima Taparia, a\u00a0marriage consultant\u00a0who became a household name in the country after starring in the hit Netflix docuseries \u201cIndian Matchmaking.\u201d It is now common for wealthy Indians to host big weddings at exotic destinations abroad and invite Bollywood actors or famous musicians to perform, she added. \u201cThe Indian wedding is about the power of contacts, the power of relationships and the power of wealth,\u201d said Aditya Motwane, an events planner who founded Motwane Entertainment & Weddings and worked on the wedding of actress Priyanka Chopra\u00a0and singer Nick Jonas\u00a0in 2018. \u201cYou show everyone you know that you\u2019ve arrived in life through these kinds of celebrations,\u201d he added. Indian weddings are often spread across several days, with an average guest list of 326, compared with 115 in the United States, according to The Knot Worldwide. The scale is exponentially\u00a0bigger when it comes to the affluent, whose weddings involve thousands of guests, foreign locations and expensive gifts. Ambani\u2019s\u00a0three-day pre-wedding party in the western Indian city of Jamnagar in March was\u00a0attended by around 1,200 high-profile guests, including Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates. It is not uncommon for the very wealthy to spend many millions on the festivities. At the Ambani party, an elaborate light show featuring 5,500 drones lit up the sky above a glass palace custom-built for the festivities, where guests danced to a performance by none other than Rihanna. The outrageously rich also come up with some unusual requests. One couple asked Motwane to arrange for an elephant \u2014 a sacred animal to Hindus \u2014 to be in Monte Carlo to bless them. With India set to become the world\u2019s third-largest economy by 2027, extravagant weddings are expected to become even more frequent. According to a report from real estate consultancy Knight Frank, the number of Indians with a net worth of at least $30 million will rise by 50% over the five years to 2028, the biggest increase of any country. And, lower down the economic ladder, by 2030 some 600 million Indians are projected to be middle-class, a segment that will represent over 80% of the country\u2019s spending power. \u201cAs the middle class grows, so does their disposable income, which inevitably is spent on lavish parties and celebrations,\u201d said Tina Tharwani, co-founder of wedding planning company Shaadi Squad. Rihanna, couture and emeralds The average luxury Indian wedding can cost anywhere between $200,000 and $400,000, according to Jefferies. This kind of budget allows for accommodation at five-star hotels across the world, sumptuous catering, decor and entertainment, and sometimes includes Bollywood actors or international singers. But the Jefferies cost estimate does not include expenses on jewelry or attire. Bridal spending accounts for over half of the total jewelry market it India, the bank noted. The country is one of the largest markets for gold, but its appetite for diamonds and other precious gems is also growing. The emerald necklace worn by Nita Ambani, the groom\u2019s mother, at the festivities in March stunned the internet with its size and sparkle. No luxury Indian wedding\u00a0is complete without\u00a0lavish meals, which at times involves flying in Michelin star chefs and the finest of ingredients from across the world. An extra layer of expense is often added to the budget because many Indians don\u2019t eat meat, and some avoid root vegetables as well. Motwane recalls planning a wedding in Florence where many guests did not eat garlic or onion. The Italian cooks \u201chit the roof,\u201d he said. A renowned Indian Italian chef and her team were then flown in. A range of other businesses are poised for growth as Ambani-style high-profile weddings lead to a \u201ctrickle-down effect,\u201d setting \u201cnew trends and standards (and) influencing couples\u2019 expectations,\u201d said Tharwani, who worked on Indian cricketer\u00a0Virat Kohli\u2019s wedding in Tuscany. Vanessa Almeida, who looked after packaging and delivery of some 8,000 gifts for Ambani\u2019s guests at the jamboree in March, told CNN that similar party favors are becoming sought-after across the country. Of the many expensive\u00a0presents that the family showered upon its A-list guests \u2014 from silver candle sticks and shawls to\u00a0terrariums and bird houses \u2014 customized leather products\u00a0are among those that have caught on, said Almeida, owner of The Gift House in Goa. Demand for wedding videographers has also boomed in the last decade, with companies charging as much as $10,000 for a film. Many couples also shoot pre-wedding videos, which are painstakingly choreographed and\u00a0inspired by Bollywood musicals. \u201cBrides and grooms go for pre-wedding shoots across the globe,\u201d said Taparia. Local economy The rise in opulent celebrations held abroad has led to some consternation among the local communities, wedding planners say. In late May, the Ambanis held a four-day Mediterranean cruise for friends and family, with a bevy of Bollywood stars and performances by Katy Perry, the Backstreet Boys and Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli. Not everyone was impressed. The partygoers drew the ire of residents in the port city of Genoa, according to media reports, as they kept several neighborhoods awake with loud music until dawn. But, despite the occasional inconvenience, such functions also generate revenue and employment in the area. \u201cYou\u2019re looking at a minimum of 2-3 million euros coming in over three days,\u201d said Motwane. The Indian government is now trying to get a bigger chunk of the luxury wedding revenue, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi launching a \u201cWed in India\u201d campaign to encourage affluent families to get married in the country. \u201cPeople often spend significant amounts of money to get married abroad,\u201d Modi said in March. But by hosting weddings in India, \u201cfamilies can enjoy lavish celebrations for three to four days, providing livelihood opportunities for locals.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/business/ultra-rich-indian-weddings-economy-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_09_homes_mississippi-west-virginia-home-ownership-rates", "text": "When Vera Sansalone, a realtor in West Virginia showed a log cabin home on a 90-acre property in Mannington to an interested buyer from the Boston area, he was shocked by the $420,000 asking price. After deciding not to buy it, Sansalone said the Boston buyer left her with one piece of advice: \u201cHe said I should mark that property up by about $300,000,\u201d she said. The relatively low listing price for a home on nearly 4 million square feet of property, while surprising to a Boston native used to sharply higher real estate prices (some studio apartments in Boston are sold for more money), may not come as a shock to residents of West Virginia. \u201cHere in West Virginia, you can get 90 acres for under half a million dollars,\u201d Sansalone told CNN. Owning a home is often touted as core to the American dream \u2013 but the ease with which a person is able to buy one is highly correlated to the wealth of the state where they live. When comparing personal wealth data with homeownership, a curious pattern emerges: Many states with high homeownership rates have lower income levels and vice versa. Demographics, competition for homes and strict zoning regulations all play a role in the cost of real estate. According to Federal Reserve data, West Virginia\u2019s average personal income of $52,585 per capita is the second-lowest in the US. However, despite its relatively low personal income levels, it has the highest homeownership rate of all 50 states, at 77%, according to US census data. Mississippi\u2014the only state with a lower average personal income than West Virginia\u2014has the third-highest homeownership rate in the country. Although there are some outliers, the trend is apparent: Cities tip the scales when it comes to homeownership Mike Simonsen, founder of real estate analytics firm Altos Research, recently pointed out the inverse relationship between wealth and homeownership on social media. He told CNN that the relationship surprised him. \u201cI would have expected that the more wealthy a place is, the more likely that its people can afford a home,\u201d he said. \u201cIt turns out the opposite is true.\u201d New York, California and Massachusetts have some of the highest levels of personal income yet count themselves among the states with the lowest homeownership rates. One of the main reasons for this low homeownership, according to Simonsen and others, is that those states all contain major cities, which attract a younger, more mobile population and offer more rental and multi-family living options compared to rural areas. \u201cBig cities attract people who are in transition or the growth stage of their lives. They\u2019re more interested in renting, or they may be more transient,\u201d Simonsen said. Many of these cities, such as New York City and San Francisco, also attract buyers from across the US and internationally, bidding up the price of homes. According to the Federal Reserve, the median sales price of houses sold in the US was $420,800 as of the first quarter. A scroll through Zillow listings shows many three- and four-bedroom homes for sale in West Virginia under $200,000.  But the average value of a home in Manhattan\u00a0is $1,102,025 and $1,299,639 in San Francisco, according to Zillow.  There\u2019s another reason that big cities skew the data. Laurie Goodman, the founder of the Housing Policy Center at the Urban Institute, said large cities and their surrounding suburbs also have strict zoning laws that dictate how land may be used. \u201cZoning makes land much more expensive because you\u2019re restricting the use of it,\u201d Goodman said. She added that land is very scarce in large cities, driving up the cost of buying a home even further. A growing number of local and state governments, led by both Democrats and Republicans, have begun to rethink zoning laws in response to the nationwide housing shortage. Some local governments have even begun loosening laws to convert vacated office spaces into affordable housing. The number of apartments in US cities scheduled to be converted from old office spaces has more than quadrupled in the last four years, from 12,100 in 2020 to 55,300 in 2024, according to a recent report from RentCafe, a real estate research company. The trend is most prominent in Washington DC, New York and Dallas, the report said. Governments are getting creative in their attempts to create new housing in other ways: In September, New York City Mayor Eric Adams announced an effort to eliminate mandates that parking spaces be included with new construction, freeing up space to build more homes. \u201cFor more than 60 years, we have added layers upon layers of regulations, effectively outlawing the kinds of housing that our city has long relied on,\u201d Adams said in a statement at the time. Homes are getting more expensive, no matter the state Despite the relatively high homeownership rates in some states, the US is experiencing a historically difficult home affordability crisis. Home prices have jumped 47% since early 2020, growing faster than household income, according to a June report from Harvard University\u2019s Joint Center for Housing Studies. Stephanie Moulton, a professor of housing and urban economics at Ohio State University, said that differences in homeownership by state don\u2019t diminish the fact that it\u2019s becoming less affordable to own a home in most areas of the country. \u201cWe know that owning a home is, for better or worse, the primary mode by which people build wealth in our country,\u201d Moulton said. Elevated mortgage rates have also helped fuel one of the most costly housing markets in decades. Even West Virginia, which counts three out of every four housing units in the state as owner-occupied, isn\u2019t insulated, Sansalone said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a change in our markets,\u201d she said. \u201cHome prices are going up here, just as they are across the country. It is a bit more difficult for buyers right now.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/homes/mississippi-west-virginia-home-ownership-rates/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "business"}}

NBC announced on Wednesday it will use AI software to recreate Michaels\u2019 voice to deliver daily recaps of the Summer Games for subscribers of its Peacock streaming platform, a milestone for the use of AI by a major media company. The use of an AI voice for the Olympics comes as the technology has grown by leaps and bounds, particularly in its ability to create images, sound and text. That, in turn, has raised questions in creative industries, such as journalism, about how artificial intelligence can \u2013 or even should \u2013 be used. A new tool, called \u201cYour Daily Olympic Recap on Peacock,\u201d will enable 10-minute highlights packages, which can include events updates, athlete back stories and other related content personalized by subscriber preferences. The company said the highlights could be packaged in about 7 million different ways, pulled from 5,000 hours of live coverage in Paris, effectively making AI (the artificial intelligence, not the man) a significantly more efficient way to deliver personalized recaps.  \u201cWhen I was approached about this, I was skeptical but obviously curious,\u201d Michaels said in a press release. \u201cThen I saw a demonstration detailing what they had in mind.

{"id": "2024_06_17_success_how-to-find-good-affordable-colleges", "text": "Long before you take your high schooler on college campus tours, consider this: Shopping for college shouldn\u2019t be any different than shopping for a home.\u00a0When you want to buy a home, you come up with a range of how much you can afford and get pre-qualified for a mortgage. Then you look in neighborhoods that offer homes that meet your family\u2019s needs and fall within your price range. \u201cAdopt a mindset that we\u2019re buying college like we\u2019re buying a house,\u201d said Beth Walker, author of \u201cBuying College Better\u201d and \u201cNever Pay Retail for College.\u201d As a financial adviser and certified\u00a0college planning specialist, Walker tries to help families avoid a situation that many find themselves in at the 11th hour: Their child applies \u2014 and gets into \u2014 schools they cannot afford because the schools won\u2019t give them enough aid. And then they just \u2026 try to make it work, no matter how much debt is involved for the parents or the student. Instead, she advises families to start as early as 9th or 10th grade in figuring out what is affordable for them as a family \u2014 so parents don\u2019t sacrifice their own financial welfare and the future college student doesn\u2019t drown in debt upon graduation. And second, she recommends assessing how a child\u2019s talents and interests pare with majors and careers they might want to pursue. Doing both those things can help you target the right colleges to apply to. Mike McKinnon, executive director of the National Institute of Certified College Planners, defines the perfect college as one \u201cwhere a student can go be happy, safe and successful, graduate in four years or less with a marketable degree and little or no debt.\u201d In helping families align parents\u2019 affordability constraints with their student\u2019s academic and social needs, he cautions them not to automatically assume the Ivys or other high-prestige schools will be best simply because of their status. And he stresses what success in life looks like after college and notes that an Ivy League degree isn\u2019t the only path to achieving it, especially if your child won\u2019t get much aid to attend. In fact, said Todd Fothergill, founder and CEO of Strategies for College, a lot of brand-name schools don\u2019t even offer merit-based aid, only need-based. So if you\u2019re not rich, but you make too much to qualify for need-based aid, you could find yourself having to cover the entire cost of tuition, room and board every year, which is pushing $90,000 at some US colleges. Set up financial guardrails well before the college search Fothergill created a free calculator called CostHero that lets parents assess what financial resources they will have available to pay for a child\u2019s college education. It then provides a range of affordability: At the low end is the number representing what they can pay if they don\u2019t take on debt. And at the high end is the number they can pay if they also take out an unsubsidized federal Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students (PLUS). \u201cIf you\u2019re not in a position to write a check for $90,000 a year, put up guardrails for yourself so you don\u2019t blow up your retirement,\u201d he said. The calculator inputs let you set the amount of resources you\u2019re willing to use to pay for college from your income and savings, your child\u2019s earnings from summer jobs, any family gifts, and any federal Stafford loans your child may take. It also factors in if you qualify for the federal American Opportunity Tax Credit. That credit, for qualified educational expenses, will reduce your tax bill or increase any refund you have coming. The calculator also gives you a debt-to-income score like the kind a mortgage lender might use to assess whether you\u2019re a good credit risk. Ideally, he said, you don\u2019t want your housing costs to exceed 36% of your gross income and your total debt \u2014 including debt from housing, cars, credit cards and any parental education loans \u2014 to exceed 43%. If your DTI ratio is close to or higher than 43% that is a sign you could get yourself into trouble if you end up having any financial problems while your child is in college, Fothergill said. \u201cIf folks have a way to determine the range of affordability prior to the onset of the college search, the outcomes are a lot better.\u00a0 For example, if one knows that the range of affordability is between $30,000 [a year] with no parent debt and $50,000 with parent debt, then any college that comes in with a net cost in that range is, by definition, affordable,\u201d Fothergill said. Net cost refers to the true cost of attendance after figuring out how much aid your child may get (e.g., grants and scholarships). Figure out where your student may qualify for the most aid Generally speaking, the biggest tuition discounts go to the most academically accomplished students in an incoming class. \u201cThe student needs to be in the top 25% of those admitted,\u201d Walker said. Getting into that top 25% cohort is based on SAT or ACT scores, and having a high, unweighted GPA based on a rigorous high school curriculum. The curriculum\u2019s academic rigor can be further bolstered by taking AP courses. Since your child is more likely to make the top quartile at some schools than others, Fothergill and Walker both recommend your child focus on applying only to those schools in which they stand the best chances of being in that top group to maximize their chances for merit-based aid. Otherwise, you\u2018ll spend money to apply to guidance-counselor-recommended \u201csafety\u201d schools or \u201creach\u201d schools with no sense if those places are affordable to you should your child get in. Using reported data from admissions officers about their key criteria in admitting an incoming class and based on what more than 1,000 schools report about the qualifications they used to grant aid, Fothergill created another tool called ListHero. It gives students a score that helps gauge\u00a0how competitive their profile is\u00a0at a given school, relative to others admitted, and by extension their eligibility for tuition discounts. Right now the tool is only available to college planning professionals for a fee. But Fothergill plans to create a free mini-version for consumers to use. For parents doing their own research on test scores, GPA requirements, costs and aid, he recommends checking the Department of Education College Scorecard, the site CollegeData.com and the College Board. Other ways to reduce college costs before applying While your children are in high school they can take other steps to reduce the total cost of their education. One way is by doing well on the PSAT to qualify to compete for a National Merit Scholarship. Another is to take AP courses. If their high school doesn\u2019t offer them, there is a program called Freshman Year for Free offered by the Modern States Education Alliance. It provides free AP placement courses and pays the fee for students to take the AP tests or college-level preparation (CLEP) tests administered through the College Board. Getting the minimum AP scores a college requires to earn a college credit will lower how much you ultimately have to spend on tuition. A third option is to see if your state has a program that offers a year of free in-state community college, the credits from which can be transferred to a state university from which your child could earn their degree. Or, if you plan to go to any other college, make sure the school will accept the credits from a community college course you plan to take. No matter what steps you take, starting the research and budgeting process early can save everyone a lot of stress, debt and potential heartache in the end. Said Walker: \u201cWe have to be a lot more intentional about this purchase.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/success/how-to-find-good-affordable-colleges/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_06_12_success_saving-under-high-interest-rates", "text": "Editor\u2019s Note: This is an updated version of an article that originally ran on May 1. As was widely expected, the Federal Reserve left its benchmark interest rate unchanged for its seventh meeting in a row on Wednesday. People carrying variable-rate debt like credit cards and those seeking a loan won\u2019t be happy given that the Fed\u2019s rate, which directly and indirectly affects consumers\u2019 borrowing costs, remains at a 23-year high. Those rates will likely stay high for a while. At this point, only one cut is seen as likely before the end of the year, according to US central bankers\u2019 latest summary of economic projections. But whenever the cuts start, they may be small. \u201cAbsent a complete about-face from the economy, interest rates aren\u2019t likely to come down soon enough, or fast enough, to provide meaningful relief to borrowers. Utilize zero-percent credit card balance transfer offers, shop around for lower fixed-rate personal loans and home equity loans, and channel as much income as possible toward paying down this debt as quickly as possible,\u201d said Greg McBride, Bankrate.com\u2019s chief financial analyst. But the Fed\u2019s decision leaves savers, once again, in the catbird seat when it comes to making money on their money. \u201cSavers are enjoying the best returns on savings accounts and CDs in more than 15 years, with the most competitive offers outpacing inflation. In addition, these conditions are poised to persist for the foreseeable future,\u201d McBride said. Online high-yield savings accounts The best bang for your savings can still be had in online high-yield savings accounts at FDIC-insured banks, which yield way more than today\u2019s 0.58% overall average savings rate. As of June 11, the average online savings account rate was 4.40%, according to DepositAccounts.com. And many online high-yield accounts continue to offer rates of 5% or more. Say you have $10,000 in savings. If you leave it parked in a regular savings account at 0.5%, you\u2019ll get $50 in interest for a year. If you put it instead in a 5% high-yield account, you\u2019ll get $500. A high-yield savings account is the best place to park money you\u2019ll need to cover emergencies as well as anticipated large expenses that you have to pay in the next three months to a year. As with any savings account, banks can lower the rate they offer \u2014 also known as the APY \u2014 at any time. And you can be sure they will do just that when the Fed looks like it will finally start cutting rates, McBride said. But, he added, since rates are likely to be cut in small increments, online high-yield savings accounts may continue to offer inflation-beating returns for some time. \u201cThey will still offer the best way to preserve your [money\u2019s] buying power,\u201d McBride said. Money market accounts and money market funds Money market deposit accounts and money market mutual funds are generating yields competitive with the best high-yield savings accounts. But there are important differences. Money market deposit accounts are bank products. So, assuming your bank is FDIC insured, your account is too. (Or, if your account is at a federally backed credit union, your money will be\u00a0insured by the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund.) As with high-yield accounts, you may get the best deals at an online bank. But money market accounts may have a higher minimum deposit requirement than a high-yield account. Money market funds, by contrast, are an investment product \u2014 they generate return by investing in short-term, low-risk debt instruments and are currently yielding an average of 5.12%, according to the Crane 100 Money Fund Index. Such funds are a good place to park cash you have in your brokerage account that you may want to use at some point to buy equities or bonds, McBride said. Money market funds are not FDIC-insured, but any brokerage you use should be insured by the\u00a0Securities Investor Protection Corporation, which\u00a0covers your funds up to a limit if your brokerage ever goes under. Certificates of deposit CDs are still a great place to park any money you can leave untouched for a fixed\u00a0period of time \u2014 anywhere from a few months to five years or longer. As of June 11, the average rate was 4.971% on an online one-year CD, and 3.815% on a five-year CD, according to DepositAccounts.com. While your brick-and-mortar bank may offer a CD at a good rate, you may get a better one shopping around. The easiest way to do that without having to set up an additional account at another bank is to shop for CDs through your online brokerage, which is likely to offer a wide array of CDs from many different banks. At Schwab.com, for instance, CDs on offer ranging in duration from three months all the way up to 10 years offered average annual returns over 5%, with most ranging between 5.30% and 5.45%. The highest annual average was 5.56% for a three-month CD. If you have to withdraw money before the end of a CD\u2019s term, you can always get all of your principal back but may forfeit some of the interest earned as an early withdrawal penalty. Treasury bills and notes Beyond deposit accounts, investing in short-term Treasury bills and intermediate-term Treasury notes has been another way to earn a competitive return with virtually no risk since Treasuries are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. Treasury bills come in six different maturities: 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 13 weeks, 17 weeks, 26 weeks and 52 weeks. Treasury notes mature in two, three, five, seven or 10 years. \u201cAs long as the Fed holds its rate in the 5.25% to 5.5% range, we expect most Treasury bill yields to hover around 5.25% as well,\u201d said Collin Martin, fixed income strategist at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. But, Martin added, \u201cWhile the timing of rate cuts has been pushed back, we still expect them to arrive later this year, and investors in short-term investments would likely face reinvestment risk.\u201d That\u2019s why he suggests investors consider buying some intermediate-term investments now before rates are cut if they want to lock in a higher yield for some of their money, such as Treasury notes maturing in the next four to 10 years. On Wednesday, yields on Treasury bills were north of 5% and yields on Treasury notes were north of 4%, according to Schwab.com. When deciding whether it makes sense to invest in a CD or a Treasury for the same duration, you might opt for the Treasury if you live in a high-tax state, McBride suggested, since interest on Treasuries is\u00a0exempt from state and local taxes. In all instances, the easiest way to purchase Treasuries and other bonds is to do so through your brokerage account.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/success/saving-under-high-interest-rates/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_01_media_hunter-biden-sues-fox-news", "text": "Hunter Biden has sued Fox News and its parent corporation, accusing the right-wing network of smearing him and unlawfully publishing his explicit images without his consent in a 2022 miniseries about his legal troubles. In the lawsuit, filed Sunday in New York state court, the president\u2019s sonaccuses Fox News of unjust enrichment, intentionally inflicting emotional distress, and violating New York civil rights laws. The lawsuit makes good on\u00a0Hunter Biden\u2019s threat he made in April that he would take the network to court if it didn\u2019t immediately issue retractions and corrections. The miniseries, \u201cThe Trial of Hunter Biden,\u201d was a six-part offering on the Fox Nation digital streaming network, and was also promoted on Fox News, the cable TV channel. It featured a dramatized \u201cmock trial\u201d about Hunter Biden\u2019s overseas financial dealings that led in part to his federal tax indictment and that also fueled House Republicans\u2019 struggling impeachment inquiry into his father. Fox News\u00a0took down the miniseries\u00a0in late April, one day after Hunter Biden threatened to file a lawsuit. But according to the lawsuit, promotional materials for the miniseries are still on some Fox News-linked social media pages, and the miniseries episodes are still circulating \u201conline and in the public domain.\u201d A Fox News spokesperson claimed the lawsuit was meritless and \u201centirely politically motivated,\u201d and said the network looks forward to \u201cvindicating our rights in court.\u201d \u201cThe core complaint stems from a 2022 streaming program that Mr. Biden did not complain about until sending a letter in late April 2024,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cThe program was removed within days of the letter, in an abundance of caution, but Hunter Biden is a public figure who has been the subject of multiple investigations and is now a convicted felon. Consistent with the First Amendment, Fox News has accurately covered the newsworthy events of Mr. Biden\u2019s own making.\u201d The new lawsuit claims Fox News \u201ctargeted Mr. (Hunter) Biden in an effort to harass, annoy, alarm, and humiliate him, and tarnish his reputation.\u201d President Joe Biden\u2019s son is seeking an unspecified amount of punitive damages, as well as any profits that Fox reaped from the miniseries, and other corrective measures. \u201cThe miniseries is fictionalized; it is not a news event. It was made for the purpose of trade and advertising, and merely exploits Mr. Biden\u2019s name, image, and likeness for Fox\u2019s commercial benefit,\u201d Hunter Biden\u2019s lawyers wrote in the lawsuit. Hunter Biden\u2019s team said in the lawsuit that without his consent, Fox News \u201cunlawfully published numerous intimate images (both still and video) of Mr. Biden depicting him in the nude, depicting an unclothed or exposed intimate part of him, as well as engaged in sex acts.\u201d The right-wing network said these images originated form Hunter Biden\u2019s\u00a0infamous laptop\u00a0\u2013 data from which was leaked by allies for former President Donald Trump in 2020. The president\u2019s son was\u00a0convicted at a trial\u00a0last month on federal gun charges, and faces a second trial this fall on alleged tax crimes. However, he hasn\u2019t been charged in connection with the bribery and foreign lobbying allegations that were at the center of Fox\u2019s \u201cmock trial\u201d series.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/media/hunter-biden-sues-fox-news/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_09_tech_ftc-ngl-anonymous-messaging-app-teens", "text": "The Federal Trade Commission and the Los Angeles District Attorney\u2019s Office have banned a controversial anonymous messaging app from serving kids under 18, taking an unprecedented and aggressive step against what regulators called \u201crampant cyberbullying and threats against children and teens\u201d on the platform. The targeted ban is the FTC\u2019s latest move in a wider crackdown on social media companies, data brokers and other businesses that allegedly mishandle consumer data or make overhyped claims about artificial intelligence. As part of a\u00a0lawsuit\u00a0and\u00a0settlement\u00a0announced Tuesday, the app being penalized \u2014 known as NGL \u2014 will also pay $5 million to settle what FTC Chair Lina Khan said was \u201creckless disregard for kids\u2019 safety.\u201d The app will also have to implement an age gate to block its services to current and new users who are under 18 years old. The regulators wrote that the app billed itself as a \u201csafe space\u201d for teens but, in reality, preyed on them. In addition to highlighting FTC follow-through on\u00a0earlier promises to police AI hype, the lawsuit directly names the company\u2019s co-founders, reflecting recent agency commitments to\u00a0holding individual executives accountable\u00a0for corporate wrongdoing. The app, known as NGL, had been downloaded millions of times, according to the complaint. NGL is an internet abbreviation for \u201cnot gonna lie.\u201d NGL actively marketed itself to young users and violated federal laws aimed at protecting children\u2019s data, the lawsuit claimed, while its employees allegedly mocked paying users as \u201csuckers\u201d while profiting from their ignorance. In a statement, NGL co-founder Joao Figueiredo said the company had spent nearly two years cooperating with the FTC\u2019s investigation but that it disputes the agency\u2019s findings, which were approved unanimously by the five-member commission. NGL responds \u201cWe view this resolution as an opportunity to make NGL better than ever for our users and we think the agreement is in our best interest,\u201d Figueiredo said. \u201cWhile we believe many of the allegations around the youth of our user base are factually incorrect, we anticipate that the agreed upon age-gating and other procedures will now provide direction for others in our space, and hopefully improve policies generally.\u201d The settlement must still be approved by the US District Court for the Central District of California before taking effect. NGL deceptively hooked teens into subscribing to its premium service by sending them fake, anonymous messages and then promising to reveal the sender after they paid, said the complaint. The computer-generated messages were purposely written to prey on teens\u2019 social anxieties or aspirations, the lawsuit said, citing examples such as \u201cI know what you did\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ve had a crush on you for years.\u201d NGL created more than 1,000 different such messages posing as real users and sent them millions of times\u00a0to persuade teens to pay to see who sent them, the complaint said. But when users paid for information about both the fake and the real messages, sometimes as much as $9.99 a week, the app didn\u2019t show the sender\u2019s name but instead provided \u201chints\u201d such as the user\u2019s rough location or the type of device being used, according to the lawsuit. The messages started being sent in 2022, a year after the app\u2019s lackluster launch, the complaint said. After users began suspecting the fake messages, many wrote negative reviews of the app and some even called it a scam, according to the lawsuit. NGL had allegedly boasted in its marketing that the app was a \u201csafe space for teens\u201d and that it used AI-based content moderation to protect users. Behind the scenes, however, the app\u2019s co-founders allegedly ignored or denigrated users who complained, with Figueiredo responding \u201clol\u201d in an internal message to a report about one upset customer, according to the lawsuit. The lawsuit and settlement are another example of how Khan, a vocal critic of the tech industry, has made regulating digital data a hallmark of her tenure. In addition to\u00a0warning\u00a0that generative artificial intelligence may \u201cturbocharge\u201d fraud and scams, Khan has proposed multiple regulations that would clamp down on how businesses may collect, use and share consumer data. One would crack down on what she calls a \u201ccommercial surveillance\u201d industry, while another seeks to\u00a0expand the FTC\u2019s enforcement\u00a0of a landmark children\u2019s privacy law. The FTC is also currently\u00a0seeking to prohibit Meta\u00a0from monetizing children\u2019s data, a move that company has challenged in court. In 2022, the FTC\u00a0forced Epic Games, maker of the hit video game \u201cFortnite,\u201d to pay $520 million to settle allegations that it used sneaky user-interface tricks known as \u201cdark patterns\u201d to dupe users into making in-game purchases. Rising ire from regulators The FTC move comes against the backdrop of a flurry of state legislation seeking to limit young people\u2019s access to social media. In another first this year, New York\u00a0approved legislation\u00a0that regulates the algorithms powering social media feeds on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and other apps. States such as\u00a0Arkansas,\u00a0Florida,\u00a0Louisiana\u00a0and many others have also passed laws clamping down on social media companies\u2019 approach to teens. Opponents, however, say the laws violate the First Amendment rights of teens and the Supreme Court has\u00a0agreed to consider\u00a0the constitutionality of age-based website restrictions in its next term. Highlighting the groundbreaking nature of the NGL settlement, FTC Commissioner Andrew Ferguson described Tuesday\u2019s action as a \u201cnovel\u201d use of the agency\u2019s legal powers. For the first time, he said in a statement, the FTC claimed that NGL broke the law \u201cby marketing an anonymous messaging app to children and teenagers despite knowing that anonymous messaging apps are harmful to these groups.\u201d \u201cThis alleged conduct, tailormade to manipulate the vulnerable teenage psyche, was reprehensible and unfair,\u201d Ferguson said. But, he argued, the public should not interpret the lawsuit to mean that it is illegal in general to market any anonymous messaging app to teens. On Tuesday, the FTC credited the consumer advocacy group Fairplay and the social media critic Kristin Bride for \u201cinvaluable assistance\u201d on the NGL investigation. Last year, Bride testified before Congress in a\u00a0high-profile hearing\u00a0about social media\u2019s risks for teens, recounting how her teenage son Carson died by suicide in 2020 after receiving a barrage of anonymous cyberbullying messages. In October, Bride and Fairplay\u00a0wrote to the FTC\u00a0calling for an agency investigation into NGL and accusing it of unfair and deceptive business practices in violation of federal law. In a statement Tuesday, Bride applauded the lawsuit and settlement. \u201cThis dangerous business model keeps kids engaged while struggling to identify their unknown harassers so that these companies can profit from more data collection,\u201d Bride said. \u201cIt is unconscionable that NGL would not only charge vulnerable teens for useless hints as to who was messaging them but that the developers themselves were sending harassing messages to teens and joking about it as parents expressed cyberbullying concerns.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/tech/ftc-ngl-anonymous-messaging-app-teens/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_12_economy_us-producer-price-index-inflation-june", "text": "Wholesale price inflation unexpectedly accelerated in June to its highest rate since March 2023, according to new data released Friday. On the surface, the jump in PPI appears to be an unwelcome development for the US economy and the fight to rein in high inflation \u2014 and it appears especially jarring landing one day after the BLS announced that consumer prices fell on a monthly basis for the first time in four years. However, economists caution that monthly data \u2014 and especially the category that drove PPI higher in June \u2014 can be erratic, and that the unexpected jump in PPI isn\u2019t likely a worrisome sign of any broader inflation pressures building in the pipeline. The June increase was attributed to a sharp rise in final demand services, specifically trade services margins, which soared 1.9% from May and offset lower energy prices and still-falling goods production prices. It\u2019s the largest monthly increase for trade services since March 2022. \u201cThe increase was broad-based among wholesalers and retailers of fuel, autos and other goods, but almost certainly is\u00a0not the start of a resurgence in margins,\u201d Ian Shepherdson, chairman and chief economist for Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote in a note to clients on Friday. \u201cThe data are volatile and often revised a lot. Margins will come under increasing\u00a0pressure as growth in consumers\u2019 spending continues to slow.\u201d Economists had expected that prices would increase 0.1% on a monthly basis and hold steady at 2.2% annually. Looking past the volatility and at the \u2018core core\u2019 PPI often is looked to as a potential bellwether for retail-level inflation in the months ahead. Increased margins make the public think of corporate greed and higher costs that are being passed along to consumers by middlemen that are making a profit along the way, said Chris Rupkey, chief economist with FwdBonds. \u201cIt does not sound good, but we don\u2019t think consumers are getting ready to be hit by a new surge in price increases just because margins are going up,\u201d Rupkey wrote in an email reply to a CNN Business query. \u201cThese margins are notoriously difficult to measure, and wholesalers do have their own costs to cover.\u201d When stripping out energy and food-related prices, core PPI jumped 0.4% for the month, rising 3% annually, its highest rate since April 2023. However, to better eliminate the influence of the volatile trade services, economists also look at a \u201ccore core\u201d reading, Andreas Hauskrecht, clinical professor of business economics, at Indiana University\u2019s Kelley School of Business, said in an interview. \u201cSo the \u2018core core\u2019 is without energy, without food and without the trade, because we think this is volatility and pricing that has no direct link with monetary policy, and we try to clean up the data so that we really see a trend,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so I wouldn\u2019t stress too much about the trade index.\u201d In June, the PPI excluding energy, food and trade was flat for the month and on an annual basis slowed to 3.1% from 3.3% in May, BLS data show. Inflation still \u2018dying on the vine\u2019 For US consumers, inflation has been trending in a desired direction during the past couple of months. Despite a brief flare-up of price hikes in the first quarter of the year, which ultimately delayed the Federal Reserve\u2019s plans for interest rate cuts, inflation has cooled considerably during the following three months. On Thursday, the US economy got more good news in the latest Consumer Price Index, the most widely used inflation gauge that measures the average price changes for commonly purchased goods and services. Prices dropped on a monthly basis for the first time since May 2020, and annual inflation slowed to 3%, its slowest rate since June 2023. The June PPI doesn\u2019t reflect a shift in inflation\u2019s slowing trajectory, Rupkey said. \u201cWe think core [Personal Consumption Expenditures] inflation for June is still likely to be either unchanged or the same modest 0.1% increase it was in May,\u201d he said, referencing a closely watched inflation gauge. \u201cInflation still looks to be dying on the vine in large part because commodities and goods price increases have moderated.\u201d The Fed bases its 2% target on the headline PCE index and has increasingly scrutinized the core PCE index for underlying inflationary trends. Energy-heavy transportation and warehousing operations saw prices fall in the early and final purchasing stages of their business, PPI data showed. That indicates that supply-side pressures are easing, Kurt Rankin, senior economist with PNC Financial Services, wrote Thursday. \u201cThe downward-trending energy PPI pace, which lies at the root of all price pressures in the US economy, implies that the second half of 2024 will see diminishing cost pressures from producers\u2019 own energy bills, as well as the cost of shipping goods to retailers,\u201d Rankin wrote.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/12/economy/us-producer-price-index-inflation-june/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "business"}}

In a letter by Michael Bloomberg in the Bloomberg Philanthropies\u2019 annual report, the billionaire said the donation addresses twin challenges: declining health and declining education. Johns Hopkins said Monday that for most medical school students, the gift will cover the full cost of attendance, including tuition and living expenses. Students from families earning less than $300,000 will be eligible for the gift. Living expenses will be covered for students who come from families that earn less than $175,000. It\u2019s not the first medical school to receive such a gift. In February, students at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York received free tuition after a $1 billion dollar donation from a former faculty member, Dr. Ruth Gottesman. In 2018, NYU\u2019s School of Medicine became the\u00a0first top 10 medical school in the country\u00a0to offer free tuition to accepted students. In the letter, Bloomberg, a Johns Hopkins alumnus, said life expectancy in the US is still lagging behind other countries since the Covid-19 pandemic. The pandemic also hurt public education, Bloomberg said, noting that \u201cremote schooling was a disaster for students.\u201d The high cost of medical school deters students from lower-income families from applying, the former New York City mayor said. He added that confronting this \u201chealth crisis\u201d should unite both political parties. An\u00a0October survey\u00a0from the Association of American Medical Colleges found that 70% of medical students who graduated in 2023 have taken on some level of education debt. The average graduate left medical school owing more than $200,000, according to the AAMC. \u201cMany who do matriculate end up dropping out because of financial pressures. And those who graduate often choose to work in the most lucrative specialties in order to repay their debts, rather than in fields and communities that are most in need,\u201d Bloomberg said, adding there are too few primary care doctors in the US. Bloomberg previously donated $1.8 billion in 2018 to undergraduate financial aid at Johns Hopkins University.

{"id": "press-corps-biden-news-conference", "text": "For nearly an hour Thursday evening,\u00a0President Joe Biden\u00a0went toe-to-toe with the press corps \u2014 and, perhaps against the wishes of some in his own party, managed to exit the high stakes showdown mostly unscathed. Fielding a barrage of tough questions, Biden addressed 11 outlets during his closely watched dance with the news media, reiterating\u00a0again\u00a0and\u00a0again\u00a0that he plans to stay in the 2024 race, while also displaying an impressive command of complex foreign policy matters. Stylistically, Biden wasn\u2019t without flaws. After introducing\u00a0Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky\u00a0as\u00a0Vladimir Putin\u00a0earlier in the day, Biden accidentally referred to\u00a0Vice President Kamala Harris\u00a0as\u00a0Donald Trump. And throughout the affair, the 81-year-old president mostly spoke in his now trademark low and monotone voice. But, unquestionably, the Biden that showed up at the conclusion of the\u00a0NATO summit was not the same Biden that walked onstage at the\u00a0CNN\u00a0presidential debate two weeks ago. Did he ace Thursday\u2019s test? Probably not. But did he score a passing grade? Most definitely. Interest in Biden\u2019s face-off with the news media had been steadily growing all week as lawmakers and other high-profile figures in the\u00a0Democratic Party\u00a0called for him to step aside and abandon his bid for a second term. Since his disastrous debate with Trump, Biden had not appeared unscripted at a public event for such a lengthy period of time. And, stepping further back, Biden had not held a solo press conference since November, making Thursday\u2019s his first of 2024. The press was eager for an opportunity to confront Biden. As CNN\u2019s\u00a0Hadas Gold\u00a0reported Thursday, journalists who cover the White House were walking into the news conference with a significant amount of pent up frustration. Reporters have felt stonewalled and misled by the White House. They had been earnestly seeking a forum in which they could directly question Biden about his fitness for office and desires to seek an additional four years. The truth is that, despite their pointed questions, reporters extracted little from Biden on Thursday evening. He stayed on message and was able to keep up with the unrelenting stream of queries directed his way. Outside his early flub referring to Harris as Trump, Biden showed a deep understanding of the issues. It was not the senile, dementia-plagued man that has been at times portrayed to the American public. As\u00a0Bill Carter, the veteran media critic, pointed out on\u00a0X, it\u2019s curious why Biden did not actually hold such a press conference in the immediate wake of his poor debate performance to assuage concerns and stop the bleeding sooner. It would have mattered a lot more then. But at this late stage, will it stop naysayers, who have been steadily gaining momentum, from calling on him to withdraw from the race? CNN\u2019s Manu Raju\u00a0reported after the press conference that it is unlikely to. Indeed,\u00a0Rep. Jim Himes, the ranking Democrat on the\u00a0House Intelligence Committee, issued a statement after the news conference saying he believed Biden should drop out of the race. But it could get a lot worse.\u00a0CBS News\u2019 Margaret Brennan\u00a0reported that four Democratic sources told her \u201cthey expect dozens of Democratic lawmakers over the next 48 hours to issue statements\u201d calling on Biden to step aside. And\u00a0CNN\u2019s Edward-Isaac Dovere\u00a0and\u00a0Jeff Zeleny\u00a0reported that\u00a0Barack Obama\u00a0and\u00a0Nancy Pelosi\u00a0have been speaking about their concerns with Biden\u2019s campaign. In other words, at this juncture, while the performance Biden delivered at the much-hyped news conference was strong, it may simply be too late.

{"id": "2024_07_02_media_biden-mental-fitness", "text": "President Joe Biden\u2019s White House repeatedly and aggressively shot down reports\u00a0on\u00a0the president\u2019s age and any possible limitations\u00a0on his ability to perform all the duties of his office. But after his shaky debate performance last week, in which Biden routinely struggled to\u00a0get his point across, some in the White House press corps say they wish they had pushed harder to tell the story. In June, when the Wall Street Journal published a\u00a0lengthy piece\u00a0on President Joe Biden\u2019s mental\u00a0state, the newspaper\u00a0got\u00a0slammed.\u00a0The White House, its allies, and\u00a0some in the media\u00a0\u2013\u00a0including CNN\u2019s Reliable Sources\u00a0\u2013\u00a0criticized the Journal for quoting mostly Republican political foes on the record, who had a clear political motive to damage Biden\u2019s image. No Democrats were quoted on the record making those allegations, and several Democrats complained their on-the-record quotes praising Biden\u2019s sharpness were not included. The\u00a0Journal defended its reporting at the time. Last week\u2019s debate on CNN laid bare many of the concerns the Journal\u2019s reporting had raised \u2013 that the president has good days and bad days but can sometimes seem to slip up. A New York Times report on Tuesday raised similar concerns by those who have recently been in the room with Biden. The Times reported Biden has more frequent \u201clapses,\u201d although at other times he appears sharp. After Biden\u2019s lackluster performance last week, some are questioning whether the White House press corps dropped the ball on fully covering Biden\u2019s limitations. Biden\u2019s\u00a0age issue is not secret or new. Nearly every media outlet has reported on\u00a0growing concerns about\u00a0Biden\u2019s age well before the debate. The White House in the past has complained that the coverage is disproportionate, and that the media is spending more time covering Biden\u2019s age than his accomplishments as president versus former President Donald Trump\u2019s lies. The media has faced accusations that it has not covered Biden\u2019s mental fitness more aggressively because it wants to prop up the campaign in some way \u2013 an accusation the White House reporters CNN spoke to denied. Several White House reporters\u00a0told CNN that\u00a0the\u00a0coverage\u00a0of Biden\u2019s age and his mental stamina\u00a0should have\u00a0pushed harder. They cited several difficulties in doing so before the debate \u2013 from the obvious political motivations of sources who either want to protect Biden\u2019s image or project a certain image, to the blowback from pursuing such reports, especially from the White House and Democrats. A difficult task Like all past presidents, Biden has good days and bad days. It\u00a0can be tricky to report on something as difficult to define as a person aging, when his opponent\u00a0is a convicted felon, who regularly lies and has threatened to use the government to go after his political opponents. Still, some reporters said the press corps\u00a0could\u00a0have done a better job\u00a0covering\u00a0Biden\u2019s physical and mental state. The failure of the media, one White House reporter said,\u00a0was\u00a0not\u00a0pushing more aggressively\u00a0into Biden\u2019s abilities after the release of the Robert Hurr report in February, which called Biden a \u201cwell-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.\u201d Biden\u2019s age was also a right-wing talking point for years, something the White House was quick to point out to reporters,\u00a0which\u00a0may have inadvertently turned off any serious investigation. For example, deceptively edited clips of Biden from the G7 spread widely by right-wing media figures were made to seem as though he was aimlessly \u201cwandering off\u201d from fellow world leaders when really, he was speaking to parachutists who had just landed during a demonstration. \u201cThe right-wing media was calling him senile from day one, and that wasn\u2019t true,\u201d the reporter said. \u201cThen whenever you report on the age you were in some ways solidifying, giving credence to some people that were actually of bad faith.\u201d All the White House reporters who spoke to CNN for this piece chose to speak anonymously so they could speak more freely about their relationship with the White House. Keeping the president at a distance Reporters said the White House has not made the press corps\u2019 job easy:\u00a0The White House has put up guardrails around Biden, they say, and\u00a0he does not engage in as many interviews or planned press conferences\u00a0as previous presidents. At those events,\u00a0the press might be able to gauge how he\u2019s doing on the spot, without prepared remarks. \u201cThey keep him at arm\u2019s length, and he rarely does extended interviews,\u201d the reporter said of the White House,\u00a0although he acknowledged Biden has started giving more interviews as of late. Biden has done fewer interviews and formal press conferences than his most recent predecessors, according to data compiled by\u00a0Martha Joynt Kumar,\u00a0professor emerita of political science at Towson University who chronicles the presidents\u2019 interactions with the press. But on quick and informal interactions with the press, like shouted questions on the way to his helicopter or plane, Biden\u00a0as of this week has had 588 interactions, Kumar reports, second only to Trump when compared to recent presidents. But those interactions are not the same as an extended press conference, reporters noted. On Tuesday, ABC News announced Biden would sit down with George Stephanopoulos for an interview, his first since the debate. The White House press shop has also been very \u201caggressive\u201d and \u201cfairly successful\u201d in mitigating coverage of concerns over the president\u2019s age,\u00a0said\u00a0another White House reporter who works for a different publication. \u201c[B]erating reporters who bring them reporting about age concerns, bemoaning that it\u2019s all anyone writes about (clearly, it\u2019s not) and often attacking pieces after they run,\u201d the reporter told CNN. \u201cI think that\u2019s left some folks to conclude that these stories are too painful to report or that they should pick their spots more. It\u2019s clear the age stories that have angered the White House (and the liberal Twittersphere) the most.\u201d Alex Thompson, a White House reporter for Axios, said on CNN the day after the debate that \u201cthe White House\u2019s response every single time\u00a0it\u00a0has come up for three-and-a-half years has been to deflect, to gaslight, to not tell the truth \u2013 not just to reporters, not just to other Democrats, but even at times to themselves about the president\u2019s limitations at his age.\u201d Still, this White House\u2019s recent conduct with reporters pales in comparison to Trump\u2019s team, which has done everything from revoking press access to reporters they disagree with, to calling reporters the \u201cenemy of the people.\u201d The White House declined to comment. Aging doesn\u2019t happen all at once Aging is also not a sudden moment.\u00a0That makes it trickier to report on. \u201cTo some extent, the decline has appeared to be gradual \u2014 hard to notice from day to day \u2014 and that\u2019s perhaps made it harder for reporters to determine when is the right moment to write something,\u201d one of the reporters said. Just a few days before the debate, Biden held a press conference at the G7 alongside Ukrainian President Vlodomyr Zelensky that passed off without anything of note in Biden\u2019s demeanor. But reporters pointed out (and have published stories noting) that the president has been using teleprompters at most big events, even fundraisers where in the past he might not have. He has also started to use the lower stairs to board Air Force One. Last year, The New York Times published a lengthy piece on the \u201ccomplicated reality of America\u2019s oldest president,\u201d which looked at some of those accommodations and concerns for his age, but also the moments where he showed stamina and vigor. Some reporters said that there has been a distinct change\u00a0within the last year, and that the press corps should have reported more aggressively on the accommodations made for the president. \u201cI think the press, most of the White House press, did suffer from a bit of lack of curiosity,\u201d one of the reporters said. Look who you\u2019re up against Biden\u2019s allies will often question coverage of the president\u2019s age, questioning why reporters focus on the president\u2019s age and mental lucidity and not on Trump\u2019s\u00a0\u2013\u00a0who, at 78,\u00a0was observed falling asleep during his hush money trial, has made his own major verbal flubs and bizarre statements, and regularly spouts complete falsehoods. \u201cIt makes sense to reflect on this now and ask whether we missed or, really, under-reported the story of Biden\u2019s age and decline. But it\u2019s complicated,\u201d one of the reporters said. \u201cThe fact that the political alternative to Biden is an authoritarian who sparked an insurrection and is a convicted felon does not mean that the press is failing American democracy to focus on Biden\u2019s obvious frailty.\u201d One of the reporters said the media can, and do, report on both. Biden\u2019s allies, however, say too much attention is placed on Biden\u2019s age and not on the threat Trump could pose to American democracy. But the reporters say they can, and should, do both. \u201cJust because you are reporting on Biden age, doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not reporting on Trump\u2019s lies.\u00a0 I find that argument silly, and it seems one design towards like producing a certain outcome in the election, rather than like an honest reporting,\u201d one of the reporters said. The outlets that had received harsh blowback for their previous reports on Biden\u2019s lucidity now feel justified. A source familiar with the staff behind the Wall Street Journal\u2019s report said that when the piece first published, the reporters were approached by people with sympathy asking how they\u2019re doing \u201cas if something terrible had just happened,\u201d the source said. After the debate, the reporters started to get messages saying they were right.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/media/biden-mental-fitness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "business"}}

Shares of the tech behemoth rose 2.1% to an all-time high close of $377.44 on Monday, beating the previous record of $376.17. That comes after shares of Microsoft fell 1.7% on Friday, when Sam Altman was ousted from his position at OpenAI in a boardroom coup. Microsoft is the artificial intelligence firm\u2019s biggest stakeholder, with a $13 billion investment in the company. Greg Brockman, who co-founded OpenAI and quit after Altman\u2019s firing, is also joining Microsoft. Altman\u2019s hiring ended days of speculation that the former chief executive could return to the firm after his dramatic firing. Emmett Shear, former CEO of Amazon-owned streaming service Twitch, will replace OpenAI chief technology officer Mira Murati as interim chief executive. Microsoft shares are up about 56% for the year. The stock is one of the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d that have powered the lion\u2019s share of the market\u2019s returns this year, boosted by Wall Street\u2019s bet that artificial intelligence is the next big thing in tech.

{"id": "2024_07_11_business_uaw-biden-fain", "text": "United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain and other members of the union\u2019s board have expressed concerns about President Joe Biden\u2019s ability to beat Donald Trump in November, a source close to the union says. The union is discussing the way forward on how to beat Trump in November, but the group is not considering rescinding its endorsement of Biden at this time, the source added. The doubts come as Biden is facing growing worries about his ability to beat his predecessor in the presidential election, after a disastrous performance at last month\u2019s CNN presidential debate raised fresh questions about his age and his mental acuity. Reuters was first to report Fain\u2019s concerns. When a reporter at a Thursday press conference raised the UAW\u2019s concerns, the president responded, \u201cThe UAW just endorsed me.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a long way to go this campaign,\u201d the president later added. \u201cI\u2019m just gonna keep moving.\u201d Biden now is working to shore up support within the labor community.\u00a0The president spent about 30 minutes at the AFL-CIO headquarters in Washington, DC, on Wednesday, describing the group of union leaders as his \u201cdomestic NATO.\u201d After Biden\u2019s drop-by, the group met privately for some time, including hearing from campaign officials. Fain, a vocal Trump critic, is a member of the AFL-CIO\u2019s executive council, which on Wednesday announced it \u201cunanimously\u00a0voted\u00a0to reaffirm its commitment to re-electing President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the leadership of the most pro-union administration in our lifetimes.\u201d The UAW formally endorsed Biden in January after months of White House overtures to the union chief. The endorsement was seen as a major boon for Biden as he looked to court working class voters in swing states like Michigan and Wisconsin. The president is set to visit Michigan on Friday as he pushes forward with his campaign in the face of deep reservations within his party over his ability to win in November. A union spokesperson declined to comment on the Reuters report. A growing list of prominent Democrats, including sitting senators and members of Congress as well as actor and fundraiser George Clooney, have called for Biden to step aside for a new party nominee for November. In a statement Wednesday, the day Biden visited the group, the AFL-CIO executive council said in a statement: \u201cThe labor movement understands, as Joe Biden does, that solidarity is how we win. The message from today\u2019s meeting couldn\u2019t have been clearer: Right now, it\u2019s time to come together around a vision of a country where everyone has a fair shot with a living wage, affordable health care, retirement security, and time to do the things we love like spending time with family and friends and pursuing our interests and passions.\u201d AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler sought to show a united front after the president\u2019s drop-by, posting a photo on X and writing \u201cHe believes in unions \u2013 and we believe in him.\u201d Biden arrived at the AFL-CIO headquarters shortly after actor George Clooney called for the president to step aside in the 2024 race in a New York Times op-ed. While meeting with the new British Prime Minister Keir Starmer in the Oval Office hours later, the president was peppered with questions from reporters about Clooney\u2019s statement, to which he raised his arms and replied \u201cAFL-CIO! Go, go go!\u201d The president has won the backing of most of the country\u2019s largest union groups at a time when Trump has also sought to make inroads with rank-and-file members. \u201cI said I was going to be the most pro union president in American history, well guess what I am,\u201d Biden said Wednesday. \u201cAnd I\u2019m staying there.\u201d CNN\u2019s Chris Isidore contributed reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/business/uaw-biden-fain/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_success_gallup-workers-economy-lonely-unhappy", "text": "Employees\u2019 negative daily emotions and lack of well-being can ultimately hurt worker engagement \u2013 and the economy, according to a new report released this week. Gallup, in its \u201cState of the Global Workplace,\u201d estimates that low employee engagement costs the global economy $8.9 trillion, or 9% of global GDP. The report includes findings from its latest annual World Poll, which surveyed 128,278 employees in more than 140 countries last year. That poll found that roughly 20% of workers globally reported feeling lonely, angry or sad on a daily basis. And 41% on average say they feel stress. Those most likely to say they feel lonely were younger workers (22%), employees who worked remotely full-time (25%) and those who felt most disengaged on the job (31%). While work isn\u2019t always the cause of a person\u2019s negative daily emotions, employers should still be concerned. That\u2019s because work can either improve or worsen employees\u2019 well-being. On the one hand,\u00a0the Gallup report noted,\u00a0\u201cwhen employees find their work and work relationships meaningful, employment is associated with high levels of daily enjoyment and low levels of all negative daily emotions. Notably, half of employees who are engaged at work are thriving in life overall.\u201d On the other, researchers found that being disengaged at work can negatively affect a person\u2019s wellbeing as much as \u2014 or more than \u2014 not having a job at all. \u201cEmployees who dislike their jobs tend to have high levels of daily stress and worry, as well as elevated levels of all other negative emotions,\u201d they wrote. \u201cOn many wellbeing items (stress, anger, worry, loneliness), being actively disengaged at work is equivalent to or worse than being unemployed.\u201d Engaged managers help workers thrive The poll found that last year only 23% of employees were engaged at work, unchanged from the year prior. Gallup defines an engaged employee as someone \u201chighly involved in and enthusiastic about their work and workplace. They are psychological \u2018owners,\u2019 drive performance and innovation, and move the organization forward.\u201d But those who said they were not engaged rose by 3 percentage points to 62%. These are employees characterized as \u201cpsychologically unattached to their work and company. Because their engagement needs are not being fully met, they are putting time but not energy or passion into their work.\u201d Engagement levels are highest in so-called \u201cbest practice\u201d organizations, where three-fourths of managers on average are engaged as well as seven in 10 non-managers, Gallup said. Their best practices include leaders\u2019 emphasizing well-being at work and in life; and putting a high priority on manager hiring and development. The manager piece of the equation is especially crucial. \u201c[W]hen managers are engaged, employees are more likely to be engaged,\u201d the report said. And, it added, \u201chigh-engagement business units are likely to see significantly higher employee wellbeing \u2014 as well as higher productivity, profitability and sales \u2014 than low-engagement teams.\u201d Where the most and least stressed workers are Engagement and well-being results varied in each of the 10 regions covered by Gallup\u2019s poll. The report noted that the United States and Canada, for example, showed the highest percentage of engaged employees (33%) among all the regions studied; and the third highest percentage of thriving employees (53%), behind Australia and New Zealand (60%) and Latin America and the Caribbean (54%). But the US and Canada also ranked second among employees experiencing daily stress (49%), right behind the Middle East and North Africa (52%). By contrast, Europe showed the lowest level of employee engagement (13%). South Asia scored lowest in terms of employees described as thriving overall (13%). And countries in post-Soviet Eurasia ranked lowest in terms of daily stress (19%).", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/success/gallup-workers-economy-lonely-unhappy/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "business"}}

However, it\u2019s clear that there is something different about Dex; she\u2019s an entirely virtual \u201cdigital human,\u201d designed by a startup in the UK. For her performances, Dex is displayed on a video screen or as a holographic projection, with her mixes created by humans. She is animated using Unreal Engine \u2014 a 3D modeling software widely used in video games \u2014 combined with motion-capture. Generative artificial intelligence allows her to remember information and respond to questions, using a voice also generated by AI. \u201cShe\u2019s probably one of the only digital humans in the performance space that you can have a conversation and interact with,\u201d says Denise Harris, CCO of startup Sum Vivas. \u201cYou can ask her anything. She is a genius about music.\u201d Last month, Dex performed at Digital Fashion Weeks in New York, Paris and Milan, and she has modeled outfits by Prada and Louis Vuitton at digital fashion events. For Liverpool-based Sum Vivas she\u2019s a \u201cshowpiece\u201d for more practical applications. The company is now developing digital humans that can \u201clisten\u201d to people\u2019s questions and converse in real time. \u201cShellie\u201d can provide product information as an avatar on company websites, while \u201cArif\u201d is set to direct passengers and answer questions as a multilingual concierge on screens at airports. According to CEO and founder Rob Sims, digital humans can help bridge the gap between AI technology and people. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve found is when people start working with and conversing with a digital human, they very quickly suspend disbelief,\u201d Sims tells CNN. \u201cIt becomes natural.\u201d AI explosion Since OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT was launched in November 2022, considerable hype has surrounded the potential of generative AI \u2014 artificial intelligence powered by huge datasets of information, capable of generating text outputs in a conversational way. Record levels of investment into generative AI have followed, with over $21 billion poured into the industry during the first nine months of last year, according to data insights company Pitchbook. In March 2023, Google launched Bard (recently renamed Gemini) and around the same time Anthropic released its AI assistant Claude. As generative AI chatbots become increasingly ubiquitous, Sum Vivas is one of several companies looking to make them more human. US and New Zealand-based UneeQ has developed animated conversational \u201cdigital humans\u201d that can be used as virtual sales reps and customer service agents on company websites, and this month it debuted Sama 2.0, an animated cabin crew member that answers questions on Qatar Airways\u2019 website and app. Microsoft recently announced that users of its Azure software would be able to create lifelike avatars capable of turning text prompts into animated speech. However, there are widespread concerns about the impact AI could have on the job market.  \u201cWhen we rely on automated tools, what skills are we losing in the process?\u201d asks Jennifer Ding, senior researcher at the Alan Turing Institute, the UK\u2019s national institute for data science and artificial intelligence. \u201cIn some ways, we think of AI as something that\u2019s helping us or augmenting our work,\u201d she says. \u201cHowever, alongside, this fear of replacement is bubbling up more and more.\u201d Harris, however, points to new opportunities within digital human design and development. \u201cEvery scenario that we found, we\u2019re creating jobs and working in harmony with people rather than taking away jobs,\u201d she says. \u201cDigital humans, first and foremost, should work with other human colleagues,\u201d adds Sims. \u201cWe\u2019ll move into a stage where digital humans will start to become just another member of the team, with added benefits for that team, and obviously the customers they serve.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/business/digital-humans-ai-dj-dex-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_07_11_business_cdk-hack-ransom-tweny-five-million-dollars", "text": "CDK Global, a software firm serving car dealerships across the US that was roiled by a cyberattack last month, appears to have paid a $25 million ransom to the hackers, multiple sources familiar with the matter told CNN. The company has declined to discuss the matter. Pinpointing exactly who sends a cryptocurrency payment can be complicated by the relative anonymity that some crypto services offer. But data on the blockchain that underpins cryptocurrency payments also tells its own story. On June 21, about 387 bitcoin \u2014\u00a0then the equivalent of roughly $25 million \u2014\u00a0was sent to a cryptocurrency account controlled by hackers affiliated with a type of ransomware called BlackSuit, Chris Janczewski, head of global investigations at crypto-tracking firm TRM Labs, told CNN. A week after the payment was made, CDK said that it was bringing car dealers back online to its software platform. Cryptocurrency allows for the exchange of digital assets outside of the traditional banking system, but a record of those transactions is accessible on the blockchain. Janczewski did not identify who sent the payment, but three\u00a0other sources closely tracking the incident confirmed that a roughly $25 million payment had been made to BlackSuit affiliates and that CDK was very likely the source of that payment.\u00a0Those sources spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the investigation. The cryptocurrency account that sent the ransom payment is affiliated with a firm that helps victims respond to ransom attacks, one of the sources said, declining to identify the firm. CDK spokesperson Lisa Finney did not respond to multiple requests for comment on Wednesday and Thursday on the apparent payment. Finney  previously declined to answer questions on the subject.\u00a0CDK CEO Brian MacDonald did not respond to email and LinkedIn messages seeking comment. The ransom payment of $25 million hasn\u2019t been previously reported. Bloomberg\u00a0reported that the hackers had made a multimillion-dollar ransom demand and that the company planned to pay. The ransomware attack that hit CDK in mid-June disrupted thousands of auto dealerships that use the company\u2019s software to manage everything from scheduling to sales and orders.\u00a0CDK\u00a0referred to it as a \u201ccyber incident\u201d in statements to reporters. In a note to clients cited by\u00a0CBS, CDK referred to it as a \u201ccyber ransom event.\u201d CDK said last week that \u201csubstantially all\u201d of the nearly 15,000 car dealerships that use its software across North America were back online to its core management system. Federal officials generally discourage paying a ransom to cybercriminals because payments can fuel future attacks. But some companies feel they have no choice but to pay off hackers to try to recover sensitive customer data or get their systems back online. The payment would be a windfall for a\u00a0relatively new brand\u00a0of ransomware criminals that emerged last year and has claimed numerous victims in the education and construction sectors, among others. BlackSuit\u2019s malicious software is similar to that previously used by other Russian-speaking criminal groups,\u00a0according\u00a0to the US Department of Health and Human Services. \u201cThe gang\u2019s leadership has been conducting ransomware extortion operations since 2019 under other ransomware brand names,\u201d said Jon DiMaggio, chief security strategist at cybersecurity firm Analyst1 who closely studies ransomware gangs. \u201cThis is one of many examples I have seen over the years where a group is either shut down by law enforcement or decides to terminate its operation to rebrand under a new name and continue attacking and extorting organizations,\u201d DiMaggio told CNN, adding that most of BlackSuit\u2019s victims have been in the US. Cybercriminals, in general, extorted a record $1.1 billion in ransom payments from victim organizations around the world last year despite US government efforts to cut off their money flows, Chainalysis, another crypto-tracking firm,\u00a0said in a report\u00a0in February. A $25 million ransom payment is certainly large but not unheard of in the lucrative ransomware economy. UnitedHealth Group, the health care conglomerate whose subsidiary suffered a ransomware attack in February that hobbled pharmacies across the US, paid a $22 million ransom to a different criminal group. But the average ransom payment in the fourth quarter of 2023 was significantly lower: $568,705,\u00a0according\u00a0to cybersecurity firm Coveware.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/business/cdk-hack-ransom-tweny-five-million-dollars/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "business"}}

There were 346 companies that filed to either liquidate or re-organize through bankruptcy in the first six months of 2024, the highest half-year level since 2010 when 467 filed, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. Just last month, 75 companies filed for bankruptcy, which was the biggest monthly total since early 2020. The majority of businesses that have gone belly up are considered \u201cconsumer discretionary,\u201d a broad category of firms that sell goods or services that people don\u2019t need every day, such as restaurants, clothing stores and car dealerships. Most of the businesses are also considered small or mid-sized, economists and investors tell CNN. Interest rates are at their highest level in nearly a quarter century, which is squeezing not just for consumers, but also businesses that rely heavily on borrowing to purchase equipment, replenish inventory, meet payroll and/or expand operations, to name a few key reasons. Access to credit is especially crucial for small, private businesses that aren\u2019t able raise money through financial markets. It\u2019s also gotten harder for them to even take out a business loan to begin with these days. A recent Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City survey of 170 small businesses showed that \u201ccredit standards tightened for the tenth consecutive quarter and credit quality decreased.\u201d \u201cSmall companies are more at risk and more sensitive to higher borrowing costs,\u201d\u00a0Matt Rowe, head of portfolio management and cross asset strategies at\u00a0Nomura Capital Management, told CNN. \u201cThe increase in implied and actual defaults that the S&P report is referencing is largely coming from the smaller cap part of the world.\u201d Consumer demand has also been underwhelming so far this summer, according to the Institute for Supply Management\u2019s latest survey of businesses that sell any kind of service. The latest spending data and comments from retailers in recent months have also demonstrated that US consumers aren\u2019t splurging this summer, unlike last year, and are instead spending more cautiously. That\u2019s troubling because the summertime is a crucial season for many kinds of service-providing businesses. Last month, an arcade and a hotel management company filed for bankruptcy, according to the S&P Global report, also citing \u201csupply-chain issues\u201d as another possible reason behind the run-up in business bankruptcies. But this might not be an omen for future economic pain, it could just be an unwinding of pandemic-related distortions in the economy. \u201cThis is probably more a story of normalization than anything,\u201d Josh Jamner, investment strategy analyst at ClearBridge Investments, told CNN. \u201cThere were a number of programs out there to support small businesses during the depths of the pandemic, and there were relatively fewer filings than usual in 2021 and 2022.\u201d Rising corporate bankruptcies could just reflect a lot of churn occurring in Corporate America, Jamner said. New business applications took off in 2020 and have remained elevated ever since, he said. Last year, there were a record 5.5 million applications to start a new business, though that pace has slowed so far in 2024, according to government statistics. \u201cAs businesses are closing, we\u2019re still also seeing plenty of new ones being formed,\u201d he added. The Federal Reserve has kept interest rates at a 23-year high for about a year now in a bid to stamp out inflation. In good news for borrowers, inflation resumed a downward trend in the spring after stalling early this year, which is widening the path for the Fed to finally begin lowering borrowing costs sometime this year. Fed officials expect to cut interest rates at least once this year, which wouldn\u2019t provide huge immediate relief, but it would still be significant. \u201cStarting to cut rates is just as important for businesses and consumers as how much rates will ultimately be cut because it is setting in motion rate cuts, which is a good thing,\u201d\u00a0Reena Aggarwal, director of the\u00a0Georgetown University Psaros Center for Financial Markets and Policy, told CNN. \u201cThere\u2019s an important psychological impact of that because businesses won\u2019t have to worry about rates going up.\u201d Small-cap stocks gained ground last week after the latest Consumer Price Index came in weaker than expected, bolstering rate-cut prospects. Banks are threatening to end free checking. Don\u2019t panic Most banks offer free checking if, for instance, customers have their paycheck direct deposited or they maintain an average minimum balance, reports my colleague Jeanne Sahadi. The majority of people with checking accounts (73%) take advantage of the option, according to a 2023\u00a0Bankrate.com\u00a0survey. But if regulatory costs go up for banks, free services like checking may go away, at least if they follow Chase\u2019s lead. Marianne Lake, the head of Chase Bank, told the\u00a0Wall Street Journal\u00a0last week that Chase might stop offering free checking and other free banking services. \u201cConsumer banking is predicated on banks providing services for free to consumers such as checking accounts, debit cards and electronic bill paying. The model then relied on banks being able to recoup those costs elsewhere in the consumer banking business, such as with debit interchange fees, overdraft fees, late fees and higher interest rates,\u201d Jaret Seiberg, financial services analyst at TD Securities, wrote in an analysis of Lake\u2019s comments.

{"id": "2023_11_21_opinions_sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic", "text": "The biggest tech news this week is the\u00a0ouster\u00a0of Sam Altman from his role as CEO of OpenAI, a move that has shaken the company and the industry. Hundreds of OpenAI employees have threatened to\u00a0resign. Altman has already\u00a0moved on\u00a0to a role at Microsoft. And OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is on its\u00a0third CEO\u00a0in as many days. It\u2019s all very juicy. But this drama should also be raising larger questions, far beyond one company\u2019s internal hirings and firings, including: Who are the people making the decisions\u00a0that will determine so much of our technological future? What guiding principles are they using to make those decisions? And how should other institutions \u2013 governments, non-tech industries, global alliances, regulatory bodies \u2013 reign in the worst excesses of potentially dangerous AI innovators? OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, with an explicit mission to harness what may soon be superhuman intelligence \u201cto benefit humanity as a whole.\u201d But that sensibility hasn\u2019t lasted. The company now has a multi-billion-dollar for-profit arm. They have been developing new technologies at lightning speed, and sometimes sending them out to the public\u00a0before some employees believed they were ready. The company has already reportedly invented an AI technology so dangerous they will never release it \u2013 but they also\u00a0won\u2019t tell\u00a0reporters or the public exactly what it is. This dynamic \u2013 a potentially dangerous technology developed at extreme speed, largely behind closed doors \u2013 is partly to blame for Altman\u2019s firing. The OpenAI board, according to\u00a0CNN\u2019s David Goldman, worried that \u201cthe company was making the technological equivalent of a nuclear bomb, and its caretaker, Sam Altman, was moving so fast that he risked a global catastrophe.\u201d At particular issue seemed to be Altman\u2019s efforts to make the tools behind ChatGPT available to anyone who wanted to make their own version of the chatbot. This could be widely disastrous, some board members worried. But then they fired him without warning, and apparently without involving Microsoft, the company\u2019s largest shareholder. Now, Altman is at the new AI group at Microsoft, and one has to wonder if the oversight and caution there will be on par with that at OpenAI, or if he\u2019ll be handed carte blanche to push as fast and hard as he wants. And for all the justified reticence of the OpenAI board, the company has carried out much of its work in secrecy \u2013 without the public really understanding what a handful of unaccountable technologists are building, and how it is nearly guaranteed to indelibly change their lives. AI is broadly understood to have the potential to reshape vast swaths of human existence. At the very least, it seems nearly guaranteed to change how we process information, how we communicate, how we learn and how we work (and if we work). And the ramifications could be much more extreme. AI technologies have already demonstrated the ability\u00a0to lie and to cover their tracks. They have already been able to\u00a0suggest the design\u00a0to make a virus spread more quickly. Many researchers\u00a0acutely understand\u00a0just how quickly these machines could develop the capacity to annihilate us, including Altman: He has a prepper\u2019s paradise prepared in Big Sur, complete with guns and \u201cgas masks from the Israeli Defense Force\u201d in case AI goes off the rails and the robots go to war against humans,\u00a0according to reporting in the New Yorker. But don\u2019t worry, he told an Atlantic reporter: If AI is determined to wipe us out, \u201cno gas mask is helping anyone.\u201d (If you want an excellent and terrifying rundown of AI\u2019s risks \u2013 at least those we understand right now, which are almost certainly a mere sliver of the looming perils \u2013\u00a0the Atlantic profile of Altman and his technology\u00a0is worth a read). AI is very exciting technology. But it is also a potentially very dangerous one, and not in the social media sense of \u201cit may give us bad self-esteem and make us lonelier\u201d but in the sense of \u201cit could break down human societies and kill us all.\u201d Given the life-altering potential of AI \u2013 that even if it doesn\u2019t kill us all, it will almost certainly change human existence in unprecedented ways at unprecedented speed \u2013 we all have a stake in how it\u2019s being developed. And yet the development is being left to a handful of people (who seem to be\u00a0largely\u00a0men) in Silicon Valley, and other tech pockets around the globe. And we all have a stake in whose interests AI will serve \u2013 and right now, its development is being funded with billions of dollars by people expecting to make a huge profit. Do the interests of the public align with the interests of the shareholders to whom profit-driven, potentially tremendously lucrative-for-a-few companies are beholden? Or with the interests of tech entrepreneurs who are primarily excited about being at the forefront of the AI revolution, regardless of the potential human costs? One thing is clear: AI is coming. And how it is built and unleashed on the public matters more than perhaps any technology of the past century. It is, indeed, up there with the atom bomb in its destructive potential \u2013 except likely more difficult to regulate and control. \u201cRegulation\u201d does not begin to scratch the surface of what\u2019s needed to make sure that the AI future is not a catastrophic one, especially since the development of AI is now a massive international arms race, with particularly horrific implications if bad actors develop this technology first. But regulation is, at minimum, a necessary step. So is transparency: In the US, companies have wide leverage to work behind a veil of secrecy, and much of what AI companies do is kept secret to stymy competition. But the public certainly has a right to understand what life-altering technologies are set to be inflicted upon us, and what the creators are doing to protect humanity \u2013 our jobs, our communities, our families, our connections, our educations and our abilities to build a life of purpose, but also our lives and our safety. The Altman story is fascinating because Altman is the most powerful figure in AI technology, which in effect makes him one of the most powerful men in the world. But that should give us pause: Who is he, what power does he hold, what is he doing with it, who does he answer to, and are we comfortable with this much life-altering potential being held by a few unaccountable people?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/21/opinions/sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk", "text": "In a year of wild tech stories that has seen Elon Musk transform Twitter, cryptocurrency exchange FTX collapse and Silicon Valley Bank implode, this week\u2019s whiplash-inducing turmoil at OpenAI is among the most captivating. Sam Altman \u2014 the leader of one of the world\u2019s most influential AI companies, OpenAI, and perhaps the\u00a0most visible figure in the fledgling industry \u2014 was fired Friday night by the startup\u2019s directors in a surprise move. Less than five days later, he\u2019s back as the company\u2019s CEO, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. The series of extraordinary events unfolded just days after OpenAI held its\u00a0first-ever developer conference, where it laid out new, commercialized versions of its technology, including the option to customize its ChatGPT AI chatbot. If you\u2019re just catching up, here\u2019s what you missed from a week so incredible you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking the script could have been written by an early version of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Friday Around 3 p.m. ET, Altman joined a Google Meet call with most of OpenAI\u2019s board that had been convened by fellow co-founder and OpenAI chief scientist\u00a0Ilya Sutskever, during which Altman was fired and told that the news would soon be made public. Within the next half hour, the board also informed Greg Brockman, another co-founder and OpenAI president, that he would be removed from the board. Around 3:30 p.m. ET, OpenAI publicly announced that it had fired Altman over concerns that he was not always truthful with the board. The board said Mira Murati, the company\u2019s chief technology officer, would become interim CEO. OpenAI\u2019s strategic partners, including its biggest financial backer Microsoft, were also reportedly informed of Altman\u2019s ouster just minutes before the board\u2019s announcement. Hours after being fired, Altman posted on X that he \u201cloved working with such talented people\u201d and that he would have \u201cmore to say about what\u2019s next later.\u201d Brockman promptly quit. \u201cPlease don\u2019t spend any time being concerned. We will be fine,\u201d Brockman\u00a0said in a Friday post\u00a0on X. \u201cGreater things coming soon.\u201d A key factor in the CEO\u2019s firing was\u00a0tension between Altman, who favored developing AI\u00a0more aggressively, and members of the OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the unfolding events. Saturday Within 24 hours of Altman being fired, reports emerged that he and other ex-OpenAI loyalists were mulling plans for their own venture. OpenAI\u2019s board was also reportedly having second thoughts and considering asking the ousted CEO to return. Sunday By Sunday afternoon, Altman was\u00a0back at OpenAI\u2019s headquarters\u00a0\u2014 this time with a guest badge \u2014 to negotiate his potential return. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reportedly mediated the discussion. A 5 p.m. PT deadline was reportedly set for the board to agree to Altman\u2019s demands, including adding a seat for Microsoft, and reinstating him as CEO. But those talks broke down. As Sunday turned into Monday, Nadella tweeted that Altman, along with Brockman, would join Microsoft to run a new AI research group. At OpenAI, the group found a new interim CEO: Emmett Shear, the former CEO of Amazon\u2019s streaming service, Twitch. Murati would return to her role as OpenAI\u2019s chief technology officer. Monday In a post on X early Monday, Shear, who left his role at Twitch in March, described the chance to join OpenAI as \u201ca once-in-a-lifetime\u201d opportunity. He added that the company would hire an independent investigator to report on what happened in the lead-up to Altman\u2019s firing. But OpenAI employees were not convinced. More than 500 staffers signed an open letter calling on the company\u2019s board to resign and reinstate Altman and Brockman. They also threatened to follow the co-founders to Microsoft if their demands were not met. Altman posted on X, saying, \u201cwe have more unity and commitment and focus than ever before. we are all going to work together some way or other, and i\u2019m so excited. one team, one mission.\u201d The drama was far from over.\u00a0The Verge reported Monday afternoon\u00a0that Altman and Brockman could still return to OpenAI if the board members who fired him resign. And Nadella, speaking to CNBC, said he was \u201copen to both options\u201d when asked whether Altman would actually join Microsoft. \u201cLook, that is for the OpenAI board and management and the employees to choose,\u201d Nadella said. \u201cWe chose to explicitly partner with OpenAI and we want to continue to do so, and obviously, that depends on the people of OpenAI staying there or coming to Microsoft.\u201d Tuesday Altman\u00a0was reinstated late Tuesday as OpenAI\u2019s CEO, the company said on X. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman\u00a0wrote\u00a0that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his\u00a0post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it has backed with billions to bolster its ambitions in developing AI. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Nadella\u00a0said\u00a0on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "business"}}

Mobile network operators including Vodafone, Deutsche Telekom and Telefonica have agreed to remove the components from their 5G \u201ccore networks\u201d \u2014 which are connected to the internet and operate as control centers \u2014 by the end of 2026. By the end of 2029, these components must also be purged from \u201caccess and transport networks,\u201d which include the physical parts of the 5G network such as transmission lines and towers. \u201cIn this way, we are protecting the central nervous systems of Germany as a business location\u00a0\u2014 and we are protecting the communication of citizens, companies, and the state,\u201d Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said in a statement Thursday. \u201cWe must reduce security risks and, unlike in the past, avoid one-sided dependencies.\u201d In the same statement, the German government underlined the importance of \u201csecure and resilient telecommunications infrastructure,\u201d given the \u201cdangers of sabotage and espionage.\u201d \u201cIn order to avoid critical vulnerabilities and dependencies, trustworthy manufacturers must therefore be relied upon,\u201d it added. Huawei told CNN in a statement that \u201cthere is no specific evidence or scenario\u201d that its technology has cybersecurity risks. \u201cWe will continue to cooperate with customers and partners in a constructive and open manner, promote the improvement and progress of cybersecurity, and promote the construction of mobile networks and digitalization in Germany,\u201d the company added.

The US also placed Huawei on a trade restriction list in 2019, which made it harder for the company to obtain semiconductor chips from American suppliers.

The decision follows what the company described as a months-long inquiry into how the term has historically been used and how it is currently being used on social media, particularly as the war in Gaza continues. \u201cWe have determined that the existing policy guidance does not sufficiently address the ways people are using the term \u2018Zionist\u2019\u00a0online and offline,\u201d Meta said in\u00a0a blog post. \u201cGoing forward, we will remove content attacking \u2018Zionists\u2019\u00a0when it is not explicitly about the political movement, but instead uses antisemitic stereotypes, or threatens other types of harm through intimidation, or violence directed against Jews or Israelis under the guise of attacking Zionists.\u201d The new approach recognizes that the term \u201cZionist\u201d \u2014 which, narrowly construed, refers to the political movement promoting the creation of a Jewish state \u2014 is sometimes used as an epithet by opponents of Israel.

{"id": "business_economy_transgender-americans-economy", "text": "Quinn Merriss, an 18-year-old who identifies as transgender and non-binary, barely makes ends meet. Merriss was kicked out of their home after years of tension and arguments with their parents over being transgender. They now live independently without any financial support from relatives, working as a server earning $5.50 an hour plus tips. \u201cI\u2019m living paycheck to paycheck,\u201d Merriss, who lives in an apartment in Cincinnati, told CNN. They manage to scrape by thanks to a housing assistance program, Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Merriss\u2019 plight illustrates the harsh economic realities of millions of Americans who identify as transgender and/or non-binary. The evidence from research and surveys is unmistakable: People whose gender identity does not match their sex at birth are more likely to experience financial hardships than the general population. (Some transgender people identify as \u201cnon-binary,\u201d which means they don\u2019t conform to one particular gender.) They deal with \u201clower employment rates, lower household incomes, higher rates of poverty, greater public assistance use, and increased likelihood of food insecurity,\u201d a 2022 study found. There are at least 5.3 million individuals who identify as transgender and/or non-binary in the United States, about the size of the Phoenix metropolitan area, according to the Pew Research Center. In interviews with CNN, economists, researchers and transgender people themselves say \u201ctransphobia,\u201d or negative beliefs and attitudes about trans people, is to blame. Transitioning genders can also cost tens of thousands of dollars, and being in the closet is well documented to take a toll on mental health. What the statistics show The dire economic straits of transgender and non-binary people hasn\u2019t been explored for very long, though much has been uncovered in recent decades. \u201cWe know that transgender people have been experiencing so many economic disparities ever since there has been data collected on them, going back 30 or 40 years,\u201d said Kevin Nadal, a distinguished professor of psychology at City University of New York\u2019s Graduate Center. \u201cIf you see a trans person and they make you feel uncomfortable, that\u2019s because you either haven\u2019t been exposed to them much before or because you have very rigid ideas about gender,\u201d Nadal said. Pew has also found that most Americans believe that a person\u2019s gender is determined by their sex at birth, but favor protecting them from discrimination. The United States Transgender Survey, conducted by the National Center for Transgender Equality, is releasing full results from \u201can unprecedented\u201d 92,329 respondents later this year, its latest iteration since the previous survey in 2015. A preliminary analysis showed that living and working conditions remain as tough as ever. More than a third of transgender people surveyed (34%) said they were experiencing poverty, and 30% said they\u2019ve been homeless at least once in their lives. The unemployment rate among the transgender people surveyed was 18%, more than four times the current national rate. The Census Bureau puts the poverty line for a single person at $14,880 in 2022, the year of the survey. The pivotal role of family support A person\u2019s family plays a crucial role in their financial health, economists say, even with something as simple as providing shelter in adolescence or early adulthood. That safety net is often non-existent for transgender people. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot about how you start out in life,\u201d said Jody Herman, senior scholar of public policy at the Williams Institute at the University of California, Los Angeles. \u201cWe\u2019ve found that trans people who had been kicked out of their homes or had family rejection experiences were more likely to be in an unstable economic position.\u201d Jay Woodman, a 29-year-old transgender man, fled his immediate family in Greenville, South Carolina, about six years ago with his partner, Alexander Taylor. The couple is currently living with Taylor\u2019s parents in southern Maryland. Woodman said he has \u201cno contact\u201d with any of his relatives after it became clear they don\u2019t support his gender identity. \u201cUnless you have financial help in some way from parents, grandparents or friends, forget about buying a house in this area,\u201d Woodman said. \u201c(Alexander) and I were even priced out of a trailer community with how bad our financial situation was a few short years ago, when he was a full time office assistant and music instructor and I worked a part-time minimum wage food service job because it was all I could get at the time.\u201d The US housing market has been notoriously tough for years, with rents rising faster than incomes and home prices recently soaring to a record high as mortgage rates remain painfully elevated. First-time buyers often receive financial assistance from family to purchase a home, according to a realtor.com survey. Many parents also help pay for higher education. Research shows that\u2019s simply not the case for most transgender and non-binary people. Merriss said they dream of attending college but have put that on hold to work full time. Disrespect while on the job is par for the course Sarah Elizabeth Isbell, 62, began to transition from male to female in 2000, eventually getting gender reassignment surgery in 2008. Isbell currently works in an administrative support role at a nonprofit organization, but she holds a law degree from the University of Oklahoma. Isbell said she worked at a civil rights law firm in the late 2000s, after she already began to transition, but got fired shortly after a humiliating incident at the workplace. \u201cI showed up to work one day wearing sandals with my toes painted red and I got ridiculed by the boss, a female boss, in front of the whole office at lunch,\u201d Isbell said. \u201cShe said \u2018Would you go to court that way?\u2019 and when I said that I don\u2019t see an issue\u2026 She just let into me relentlessly about how men can\u2019t dress like that.\u201d \u201cThat was really mortifying,\u201d she added. Isbell said she has struggled to find another job as a lawyer. \u201cI did civil rights law. But after my transition, even my civll rights lawyer friends didn\u2019t want to hire me. I kept being told that juries and clients with cases in front of juries won\u2019t accept a transgender trial lawyer,\u201d she said. in 2020, the Supreme Court ruled in a landmark civil rights case that employers are prohibited from discriminating against LGBTQ employees. The case before the nation\u2019s highest court, Bostock v. Clayton County, was a consolidation of three similar cases around the country. One of them was brought by Aimee Stephens, who came out as a transgender woman in 2013 while working as a funeral director in a suburb near Detroit. She informed her employer in a letter that she would be coming in dressed as a woman and was fired shortly after, which led to Stephens\u2019 lawsuit. Stephens passed away a month before the Supreme Court\u2019s decision. \u201cTrans folks have been protected (at the workplace) under federal law for four years now, but it\u2019s not clear how well that\u2019s working,\u201d Michael Martell, an economics professor at Bard College, told CNN. \u201cTrans people face stigma throughout their lives, so it\u2019s certainly fair to say that labor market discrimination is a contributing factor to their disadvantages in life.\u201d The early report of the US Transgender Survey showed that 11% of respondents said they had been fired, forced to resign or been laid off because of their gender identity or expression. And transgender people say they still deal with disrespect while on the job. A common issue for transgender people is being misgendered, or referred to with terms that don\u2019t reflect their chosen gender identity, which is sometimes done by accident and other times purposefully. Merriss, Woodman and Isbell all said they\u2019ve been misgendered at the workplace. A wave of anti-transgender bills across states A historic wave of bills in state legislatures across the nation aims to ban access to gender-affirming health care for transgender youth and regulate curricula in public schools, including discussions on gender identity. Last year, there were at least 510 anti-LGBTQ bills introduced by lawmakers in various states, most of them controlled by Republicans, according to American Civil Liberties Union data. That set a record and was nearly three times the number of similar bills introduced in 2022. More than two-thirds of the 167 anti-LGBTQ bills introduced last year related to health care were aimed at blocking trans minors from getting gender-affirming care. According to Trans Legislation Tracker, 40 anti-trans state bills have so far been signed into law this year, in addition to eight that have been passed by lawmakers but haven\u2019t been approved or vetoed by a governor yet. Despite the economic struggles and hostile political landscape across the country, researchers and transgender people say that being your authentic self is invaluable. An overwhelming 94% of respondents in the latest US Transgender Survey said they \u201creported that they were either \u2018a lot more satisfied\u2019 or \u2018a little more satisfied\u2019 with their life\u201d after transitioning genders. \u201cIt\u2019s awful some days, but I would not give up being this way,\u201d Merriss said. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten away from the family toxic environment, and it\u2019s been so helpful seeing celebrities and characters in media being portrayed positively as a trans person.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/business/economy/transgender-americans-economy/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "business"}}

BYD\u2019s CEO Wang Chuanfu and Turkey\u2019s Industry and Technology Minister Mehmet Fatih Kaci signed the agreement in Istanbul, according to a statement from the Turkish ministry Monday. Turkish President Recep Tayyip\u00a0Erdogan attended the signing ceremony, it said. \u201cWe aim to meet the growing demand for new-energy vehicles in the region and reach consumers in Europe,\u201d the statement cited BYD representatives as saying. The announcement came just days after provisional additional duties on imports of Chinese-made EVs into the European Union came into effect.\u00a0The tariffs, ranging from 17.4% to 37.6%, are aimed at stopping a flood of cheap Chinese cars built with what the EU deems unfair support from the government. Turkey is in a customs union with the EU. That means vehicles can be exported from the country to the trading bloc tariff-free. According to the agreement with Turkey, BYD will invest about $1 billion in the factory, which will be able to produce 150,000 electric and hybrid vehicles annually, and set up a research and development center for sustainable mobility technologies at the plant. The factory is expected to start production at the end of 2026 and provide as many as 5,000 jobs in the country. CNN has reached out to BYD for comment but hasn\u2019t received a response. The EU\u2019s decision earlier this year imposed an extra 17.4% tariff on the vehicles BYD ships from China to the bloc, which also has a standard 10% duty on all car imports. Talks between the EU and China are expected to continue but, if no agreement is reached, the additional tariffs will become definitive in November. BYD already announced in December that it would build an EV factory in EU member Hungary, becoming the first major Chinese automaker\u00a0to build passenger cars in Europe.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/business/china-ev-byd-turkey-plant-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "business"}}
