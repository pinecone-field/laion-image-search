{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl", "text": "Sam Altman has agreed to return to lead OpenAI, the company said in a Tuesday post on X, just days after his surprise ouster as chief executive sparked an employee revolt that threatened to undermine what has been the leading company in the fledgling artificial intelligence industry. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman wrote that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft, which is the ChatGPT maker\u2019s biggest financial backer. The announcement appears to bring to an end days of chaos for the AI industry that included negotiations over who should lead OpenAI and how the firm should be run, as well as broader discussions about just how fast the arms race to develop AI technology should be moving. The details of Altman\u2019s firing and re-hiring remain murky. In its announcement Friday, OpenAI claimed that Altman had been insufficiently \u201ccandid\u201d with the board. That ambiguous language sent the rumor mill flying. But a key factor in Altman\u2019s ouster was the presence of\u00a0tensions between Altman, who favored pushing AI development more aggressively, and members of the original OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the crisis. As of Monday morning, Nadella had announced that Altman, along with fellow OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, would be joining Microsoft to lead a new AI research division. OpenAI said it had hired former Twitch chief Emmett Shear as interim CEO. But then hundreds of OpenAI employees, nearly the company\u2019s entire staff, threatened to leave, potentially for Microsoft, if the company\u2019s board didn\u2019t resign and reinstate Altman as CEO. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it invested billions in to help bolster its ambitions in developing AI, which many in Silicon Valley think will be the most important wave of technological advancement in the coming decades. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Microsoft CEO\u00a0Satya Nadella said on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d Altman\u2019s vision to quickly roll out and commercialize AI tools also appears to have won out. Publicly, Altman has long cautioned about risks posed by AI, and he\u202fhas pledged to lawmakers and customers that he would move OpenAI forward responsibly. \u201cIs [AI] gonna be like the printing press that diffused knowledge, power and learning widely across the landscape that empowered ordinary, everyday individuals that led to greater flourishing, that led above all to greater liberty?\u201d he said in a May Senate subcommittee hearing pressing for regulation. \u201cOr is it gonna be more like the atom bomb \u2014 huge technological breakthrough, but the consequences (severe, terrible) continue to haunt us to this day?\u201d But inside the company, Altman had been pushing to bring products to market more quickly and to sell them for a profit. Altman announced a few weeks ago at OpenAI\u2019s first-ever developer day that the company would make tools available so anyone could create their own version of ChatGPT. OpenAI has also worked with Microsoft to roll out ChatGPT-like technology across Microsoft\u2019s products. OpenAI and iPhone designer Jony Ive had also reportedly\u202fbeen in talks to raise $1 billion from Japanese conglomerate SoftBank for an AI device to replace the smartphone. \u2014 CNN\u2019s Juliana Liu and Diksha Madhok contributed reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_03_tech_elevenlabs-ai-celebrity-voices", "text": "Actress Judy Garland never recorded her voice to read an audiobook of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, but you\u2019ll soon be able to hear her rendition of the children\u2019s novel that inspired the movie nonetheless. Earlier this week, AI company ElevenLabs said it is bringing digitally produced celebrity voice-overs of deceased actors, including Garland, James Dean and Burt Reynolds, to its newly launched Reader app. The company said the app takes articles, PDF, ePub, newsletters, e-books or any other text on your phone and turns it into voice-overs.  \u201cWe deeply respect their legacy and are honored to have their voices as part of our platform,\u201d said Dustin Blank, head of partnerships at ElevenLabs. \u201cAdding them to our growing list of narrators marks a major step forward in our mission of making content accessible in any language and voice.\u201d The company said it made deals with the estates of the actors whose voices are being used, but did not share details about compensation. The effort shows the potential of artificial intelligence for Hollywood but also sets a precedent for licensing and working with estates. It also comes at a time when the technology has grown by leaps and bounds, particularly in its ability to create images, text and sound, making it easy for anyone to create a version of someone\u2019s voice saying something they never did. That, in turn, has raised questions in creative industries such as journalism and film about how artificial intelligence can \u2014 or even should \u2014 be used. ElevenLabs previously made headlines earlier this year when its tool was reportedly used to create a fake robocall from President Joe Biden urging people not to vote in New Hampshire\u2019s presidential primary. Copyright questions and authenticity The partnership with the stars\u2019 estates comes two months after ChatGPT-maker OpenAI came under fire after introducing a synthetic voice that was eerily similar to Scarlett Johansson\u2019s character in the film \u201cHer.\u201d Johansson said in a statement shared with CNN that she was \u201cshocked, angered and in disbelief\u201d that the company would use her likeliness likeness after she turned down a partnership opportunity with OpenAI. Although a person can\u2019t copyright their own voice, it\u2019s possible to copyright a recording, according to David Gunkel, a professor at the department of communications at Northern Illinois University who tracks AI in media and entertainment. The AI is trained on old recordings and those recordings are under copyright. \u201cElevenLabs\u2019 new partnerships are all well within the realm of what the law allows,\u201d he said. \u201cAn estate will get a considerable amount of money from licensing and agreements. It\u2019s not unlike a company negotiating a copyright deal to use a popular song by Queen in an ad. The record company also could in theory say no, no matter how much money they\u2019re offered.\u201d Bern Elliot, a vice president and analyst at market research firm Gartner, said AI models can now be trained on fewer audio recordings; very little is needed to capture tone, speech patterns and other elements, whether it\u2019s for a celebrity or an everyday person. \u201cThe bigger concern is determining what the owner of those recordings can or can\u2019t do to monetize the voice,\u201d he said. Media companies are also ramping up their use of AI for voiceovers. Last week, NBC announced it is bringing an AI-version version of famed sportscaster Al Michaels back to the Olympics this summer, in daily recaps on its Peacock streaming platform. An NBC spokesperson told CNN that Michaels is being compensated for his involvement. It\u2019s unclear, however, how AI versions of well-known voices will be received by mass audiences and if it will raise concerns around authenticity. \u201cWe don\u2019t know yet the supposed market for these types of things but you can already see with audiobooks that ones read by recognizable voices and celebrities are a hot commodity,\u201d Gunkel said. \u201cIf there\u2019s a way to have a celebrity do all kinds of content and not voice it themselves, that could open up the market even wider.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/tech/elevenlabs-ai-celebrity-voices/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "business"}}

A stalemate in Washington could destroy a landmark tax deal that was painstakingly hammered out among 140 countries over the better part of a decade. Some analysts say that the United States\u2019 inability to ratify the deal could lead to a tax war among the richest nations that would hit tech behemoths like Google, Apple, Meta and Amazon particularly hard. What\u2019s happening: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) worked for years to negotiate a deal among its member countries that would close loopholes allowing large multinational companies to avoid paying up to $240 billion each year in tax. In 2021, the OECD came up with an agreement that all parties signed on to. Called the \u201dPillar 1\u201d reform, it would simply require companies to pay taxes in the country they made money in, regardless of whether or not the company was headquartered there. It took more than a decade of work by the OECD and related parties to get there. The problem: The Pillar 1 reform was supposed to be ratified by June 30. That didn\u2019t happen. While the Biden administration broadly supports the plan, Senate Republicans are against it, and a divided Senate has stopped the US ratifying the agreement. (\u201cUnder the US Constitution, tax treaties require the advice and consent of the Senate, with a two-thirds majority vote of approval,\u201d according to the Senate Committee on Finance website.) Former President Donald Trump, meanwhile, has indicated that he wouldn\u2019t support the reforms if he\u2019s elected back into the Oval Office this November. Other countries aren\u2019t waiting to find out. Canada recently implemented a local tax on the world\u2019s largest tech companies, something the OECD treaty had sought to avoid. New Zealand has also said it will implement its own digital services tax on large multinational companies beginning in 2025. Manal Corwin, director of the OECD\u2019s Centre for Tax Policy and Administration, says that negotiations are still ongoing. \u201cCountries are still at the table, precisely because we are making progress,\u201d she wrote in a statement Monday. \u201cAs each of these milestones arrives, whether we successfully conclude by a given date or not, we get closer to the finish line,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is exactly why the commitment remains high and why we remain optimistic that the (group) can deliver a final agreement.\u201d What it means: If no global agreement goes into effect, some countries will begin to compete for revenue from large multinationals by lowering taxes in what is sometimes called a \u201ctax war.\u201d It will also mean that large tech companies will have to contend with inconsistent tax codes around the globe, as national taxes proliferate (see Canada and New Zealand.) \u201cWhen companies are feeling secure and can predict where policy is going and what the global financial outlook will be for the foreseeable future, they are much more confident in making investments,\u201d said Megan Funkhouser of the Information Technology Industry Council, a group that represents the tech sector. If taxation and global policy toward digital companies is \u201cuncertain, unpredictable and unstable\u201d she said, companies might not want to \u201cmake investments, contribute to economic growth and create and retain jobs.\u201d America\u2019s red-hot job market just won\u2019t quit The number of available jobs in the US unexpectedly grew in May, signaling\u00a0continued resilience\u00a0in the nation\u2019s labor market, reports my CNN colleague Alicia Wallace. Job openings jumped higher to 8.14 million in May, from a\u00a0downwardly revised 7.91 million in April, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 latest Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) report released Tuesday. Economists had expected openings would fall to 7.91 million, according to FactSet consensus estimates. Despite the uptick in job postings, which can be\u00a0quite volatile,\u00a0May\u2019s JOLTS report marked\u00a0a significant milestone for the US labor market: The ratio of job openings to those who are unemployed fell to 1.22 matching the figure seen in February 2020, a month prior to the pandemic lockdowns that shocked the global economy. That ratio has been steadily moving lower since hitting a record 2.0\u00a0in March 2022, JOLTS data shows. The Bureau of Labor Statistics will release the latest jobs report at 8:30 a.m. ET on Friday. FTC unanimously moves to block $4 billion merger of mattress giants The Federal Trade Commission is taking a firm stance on a mattress merger. The agency unanimously voted to block mattress maker Tempur Sealy\u2019s purchase of Mattress Firm on Tuesday, reports my CNN colleague Ramishah Maruf. In May 2023, Tempur Sealy \u2014 the world\u2019s largest mattress supplier and manufacturer \u2014 agreed to buy the United States\u2019 largest bedding retailer\u00a0in a roughly $4 billion deal. The FTC\u00a0authorized a lawsuit in federal court\u00a0to block the acquisition. The Commission said that the proposed deal would suppress competition and raise prices for mattress buyers and give the companies \u201cenormous power\u201d in the mattress supply chain. The FTC also said that documents showed that competing mattress suppliers would lose access to its most important retail channel. These suppliers employ thousands of American workers, it said. The deal would have given the combined company 3,000 stores and 71 manufacturing facilities and was expected to close in the second half of 2024. Tempur Sealy\u2019s portfolio includes Tempur-Pedic, Sealy and Stearns and Foster.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/investing/premarket-stocks-global-tax-tech/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_05_business_ultra-rich-indian-weddings-economy-intl-hnk", "text": "The wedding of the year is\u00a0here. In less than a week, Anant Ambani, son of Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani, will marry his girlfriend Radhika Merchant. India is no stranger to opulent weddings, but the preparations and parties for this particular union have transfixed the country. Jaw-dropping guest lists, which have included Silicon Valley\u00a0billionaires and Bollywood stars, have underscored Mukesh Ambani\u2019s growing influence in the global economy. Asia\u2019s richest family has also shown off its wealth with a display of jewels evoking the long-gone era of maharajahs and Mughal emperors. And, last week, Justin Bieber became the latest international pop star to entertain at yet another pre-wedding function by the Ambanis in Mumbai. The singer performed at the the sangeet ceremony, a night when the bride and groom\u2019s wedding party dances for guests. It also saw the entire Ambani clan, including Mukesh, on stage dancing to Bollywood\u2019s hit song, Deewangi Deewangi. The Ambanis have set a new benchmark for big, fat Indian weddings, which are bound to grow bigger and louder than ever before as the number of the ultra-rich swells in the world\u2019s fastest-growing major economy. \u201cThe Ambani wedding parties have \u2026 had a multi-faceted impact on the wedding industry in India, influencing trends, boosting demand for wedding vendors, promoting cultural heritage and even driving economic growth,\u201d Tim Chi, CEO of The Knot Worldwide,\u00a0a wedding planning service,\u00a0told CNN. The Indian wedding industry has boomed since the country emerged from the pandemic. Estimated at about $130 billion, it\u2019s now nearly twice the size of America\u2019s, although still smaller than that of China\u2019s, according to a report by Jefferies last month. The industry plays a major role in boosting sectors such as fashion and travel. \u201cAn otherwise value-conscious society, Indians love to spend on weddings,\u201d Jefferies said. \u201cAnd this is irrespective of the economic classes.\u201d At about $15,000, the average Indian wedding costs more than\u00a0three\u00a0times the average annual household income. More than a status symbol Weddings can be expensive affairs in any country, but in India they are especially important as symbols of power and status. Parents in South Asia typically spend a significant portion of their lifetime savings on their children\u2019s weddings, but the scale of many of these events has now become gargantuan, coinciding with India\u2019s rise as an economic powerhouse. \u201cIn the last decade there has been a big shift in Indian weddings across the board,\u201d said Sima Taparia, a\u00a0marriage consultant\u00a0who became a household name in the country after starring in the hit Netflix docuseries \u201cIndian Matchmaking.\u201d It is now common for wealthy Indians to host big weddings at exotic destinations abroad and invite Bollywood actors or famous musicians to perform, she added. \u201cThe Indian wedding is about the power of contacts, the power of relationships and the power of wealth,\u201d said Aditya Motwane, an events planner who founded Motwane Entertainment & Weddings and worked on the wedding of actress Priyanka Chopra\u00a0and singer Nick Jonas\u00a0in 2018. \u201cYou show everyone you know that you\u2019ve arrived in life through these kinds of celebrations,\u201d he added. Indian weddings are often spread across several days, with an average guest list of 326, compared with 115 in the United States, according to The Knot Worldwide. The scale is exponentially\u00a0bigger when it comes to the affluent, whose weddings involve thousands of guests, foreign locations and expensive gifts. Ambani\u2019s\u00a0three-day pre-wedding party in the western Indian city of Jamnagar in March was\u00a0attended by around 1,200 high-profile guests, including Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates. It is not uncommon for the very wealthy to spend many millions on the festivities. At the Ambani party, an elaborate light show featuring 5,500 drones lit up the sky above a glass palace custom-built for the festivities, where guests danced to a performance by none other than Rihanna. The outrageously rich also come up with some unusual requests. One couple asked Motwane to arrange for an elephant \u2014 a sacred animal to Hindus \u2014 to be in Monte Carlo to bless them. With India set to become the world\u2019s third-largest economy by 2027, extravagant weddings are expected to become even more frequent. According to a report from real estate consultancy Knight Frank, the number of Indians with a net worth of at least $30 million will rise by 50% over the five years to 2028, the biggest increase of any country. And, lower down the economic ladder, by 2030 some 600 million Indians are projected to be middle-class, a segment that will represent over 80% of the country\u2019s spending power. \u201cAs the middle class grows, so does their disposable income, which inevitably is spent on lavish parties and celebrations,\u201d said Tina Tharwani, co-founder of wedding planning company Shaadi Squad. Rihanna, couture and emeralds The average luxury Indian wedding can cost anywhere between $200,000 and $400,000, according to Jefferies. This kind of budget allows for accommodation at five-star hotels across the world, sumptuous catering, decor and entertainment, and sometimes includes Bollywood actors or international singers. But the Jefferies cost estimate does not include expenses on jewelry or attire. Bridal spending accounts for over half of the total jewelry market it India, the bank noted. The country is one of the largest markets for gold, but its appetite for diamonds and other precious gems is also growing. The emerald necklace worn by Nita Ambani, the groom\u2019s mother, at the festivities in March stunned the internet with its size and sparkle. No luxury Indian wedding\u00a0is complete without\u00a0lavish meals, which at times involves flying in Michelin star chefs and the finest of ingredients from across the world. An extra layer of expense is often added to the budget because many Indians don\u2019t eat meat, and some avoid root vegetables as well. Motwane recalls planning a wedding in Florence where many guests did not eat garlic or onion. The Italian cooks \u201chit the roof,\u201d he said. A renowned Indian Italian chef and her team were then flown in. A range of other businesses are poised for growth as Ambani-style high-profile weddings lead to a \u201ctrickle-down effect,\u201d setting \u201cnew trends and standards (and) influencing couples\u2019 expectations,\u201d said Tharwani, who worked on Indian cricketer\u00a0Virat Kohli\u2019s wedding in Tuscany. Vanessa Almeida, who looked after packaging and delivery of some 8,000 gifts for Ambani\u2019s guests at the jamboree in March, told CNN that similar party favors are becoming sought-after across the country. Of the many expensive\u00a0presents that the family showered upon its A-list guests \u2014 from silver candle sticks and shawls to\u00a0terrariums and bird houses \u2014 customized leather products\u00a0are among those that have caught on, said Almeida, owner of The Gift House in Goa. Demand for wedding videographers has also boomed in the last decade, with companies charging as much as $10,000 for a film. Many couples also shoot pre-wedding videos, which are painstakingly choreographed and\u00a0inspired by Bollywood musicals. \u201cBrides and grooms go for pre-wedding shoots across the globe,\u201d said Taparia. Local economy The rise in opulent celebrations held abroad has led to some consternation among the local communities, wedding planners say. In late May, the Ambanis held a four-day Mediterranean cruise for friends and family, with a bevy of Bollywood stars and performances by Katy Perry, the Backstreet Boys and Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli. Not everyone was impressed. The partygoers drew the ire of residents in the port city of Genoa, according to media reports, as they kept several neighborhoods awake with loud music until dawn. But, despite the occasional inconvenience, such functions also generate revenue and employment in the area. \u201cYou\u2019re looking at a minimum of 2-3 million euros coming in over three days,\u201d said Motwane. The Indian government is now trying to get a bigger chunk of the luxury wedding revenue, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi launching a \u201cWed in India\u201d campaign to encourage affluent families to get married in the country. \u201cPeople often spend significant amounts of money to get married abroad,\u201d Modi said in March. But by hosting weddings in India, \u201cfamilies can enjoy lavish celebrations for three to four days, providing livelihood opportunities for locals.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/business/ultra-rich-indian-weddings-economy-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_07_02_media_biden-mental-fitness", "text": "President Joe Biden\u2019s White House repeatedly and aggressively shot down reports\u00a0on\u00a0the president\u2019s age and any possible limitations\u00a0on his ability to perform all the duties of his office. But after his shaky debate performance last week, in which Biden routinely struggled to\u00a0get his point across, some in the White House press corps say they wish they had pushed harder to tell the story. In June, when the Wall Street Journal published a\u00a0lengthy piece\u00a0on President Joe Biden\u2019s mental\u00a0state, the newspaper\u00a0got\u00a0slammed.\u00a0The White House, its allies, and\u00a0some in the media\u00a0\u2013\u00a0including CNN\u2019s Reliable Sources\u00a0\u2013\u00a0criticized the Journal for quoting mostly Republican political foes on the record, who had a clear political motive to damage Biden\u2019s image. No Democrats were quoted on the record making those allegations, and several Democrats complained their on-the-record quotes praising Biden\u2019s sharpness were not included. The\u00a0Journal defended its reporting at the time. Last week\u2019s debate on CNN laid bare many of the concerns the Journal\u2019s reporting had raised \u2013 that the president has good days and bad days but can sometimes seem to slip up. A New York Times report on Tuesday raised similar concerns by those who have recently been in the room with Biden. The Times reported Biden has more frequent \u201clapses,\u201d although at other times he appears sharp. After Biden\u2019s lackluster performance last week, some are questioning whether the White House press corps dropped the ball on fully covering Biden\u2019s limitations. Biden\u2019s\u00a0age issue is not secret or new. Nearly every media outlet has reported on\u00a0growing concerns about\u00a0Biden\u2019s age well before the debate. The White House in the past has complained that the coverage is disproportionate, and that the media is spending more time covering Biden\u2019s age than his accomplishments as president versus former President Donald Trump\u2019s lies. The media has faced accusations that it has not covered Biden\u2019s mental fitness more aggressively because it wants to prop up the campaign in some way \u2013 an accusation the White House reporters CNN spoke to denied. Several White House reporters\u00a0told CNN that\u00a0the\u00a0coverage\u00a0of Biden\u2019s age and his mental stamina\u00a0should have\u00a0pushed harder. They cited several difficulties in doing so before the debate \u2013 from the obvious political motivations of sources who either want to protect Biden\u2019s image or project a certain image, to the blowback from pursuing such reports, especially from the White House and Democrats. A difficult task Like all past presidents, Biden has good days and bad days. It\u00a0can be tricky to report on something as difficult to define as a person aging, when his opponent\u00a0is a convicted felon, who regularly lies and has threatened to use the government to go after his political opponents. Still, some reporters said the press corps\u00a0could\u00a0have done a better job\u00a0covering\u00a0Biden\u2019s physical and mental state. The failure of the media, one White House reporter said,\u00a0was\u00a0not\u00a0pushing more aggressively\u00a0into Biden\u2019s abilities after the release of the Robert Hurr report in February, which called Biden a \u201cwell-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.\u201d Biden\u2019s age was also a right-wing talking point for years, something the White House was quick to point out to reporters,\u00a0which\u00a0may have inadvertently turned off any serious investigation. For example, deceptively edited clips of Biden from the G7 spread widely by right-wing media figures were made to seem as though he was aimlessly \u201cwandering off\u201d from fellow world leaders when really, he was speaking to parachutists who had just landed during a demonstration. \u201cThe right-wing media was calling him senile from day one, and that wasn\u2019t true,\u201d the reporter said. \u201cThen whenever you report on the age you were in some ways solidifying, giving credence to some people that were actually of bad faith.\u201d All the White House reporters who spoke to CNN for this piece chose to speak anonymously so they could speak more freely about their relationship with the White House. Keeping the president at a distance Reporters said the White House has not made the press corps\u2019 job easy:\u00a0The White House has put up guardrails around Biden, they say, and\u00a0he does not engage in as many interviews or planned press conferences\u00a0as previous presidents. At those events,\u00a0the press might be able to gauge how he\u2019s doing on the spot, without prepared remarks. \u201cThey keep him at arm\u2019s length, and he rarely does extended interviews,\u201d the reporter said of the White House,\u00a0although he acknowledged Biden has started giving more interviews as of late. Biden has done fewer interviews and formal press conferences than his most recent predecessors, according to data compiled by\u00a0Martha Joynt Kumar,\u00a0professor emerita of political science at Towson University who chronicles the presidents\u2019 interactions with the press. But on quick and informal interactions with the press, like shouted questions on the way to his helicopter or plane, Biden\u00a0as of this week has had 588 interactions, Kumar reports, second only to Trump when compared to recent presidents. But those interactions are not the same as an extended press conference, reporters noted. On Tuesday, ABC News announced Biden would sit down with George Stephanopoulos for an interview, his first since the debate. The White House press shop has also been very \u201caggressive\u201d and \u201cfairly successful\u201d in mitigating coverage of concerns over the president\u2019s age,\u00a0said\u00a0another White House reporter who works for a different publication. \u201c[B]erating reporters who bring them reporting about age concerns, bemoaning that it\u2019s all anyone writes about (clearly, it\u2019s not) and often attacking pieces after they run,\u201d the reporter told CNN. \u201cI think that\u2019s left some folks to conclude that these stories are too painful to report or that they should pick their spots more. It\u2019s clear the age stories that have angered the White House (and the liberal Twittersphere) the most.\u201d Alex Thompson, a White House reporter for Axios, said on CNN the day after the debate that \u201cthe White House\u2019s response every single time\u00a0it\u00a0has come up for three-and-a-half years has been to deflect, to gaslight, to not tell the truth \u2013 not just to reporters, not just to other Democrats, but even at times to themselves about the president\u2019s limitations at his age.\u201d Still, this White House\u2019s recent conduct with reporters pales in comparison to Trump\u2019s team, which has done everything from revoking press access to reporters they disagree with, to calling reporters the \u201cenemy of the people.\u201d The White House declined to comment. Aging doesn\u2019t happen all at once Aging is also not a sudden moment.\u00a0That makes it trickier to report on. \u201cTo some extent, the decline has appeared to be gradual \u2014 hard to notice from day to day \u2014 and that\u2019s perhaps made it harder for reporters to determine when is the right moment to write something,\u201d one of the reporters said. Just a few days before the debate, Biden held a press conference at the G7 alongside Ukrainian President Vlodomyr Zelensky that passed off without anything of note in Biden\u2019s demeanor. But reporters pointed out (and have published stories noting) that the president has been using teleprompters at most big events, even fundraisers where in the past he might not have. He has also started to use the lower stairs to board Air Force One. Last year, The New York Times published a lengthy piece on the \u201ccomplicated reality of America\u2019s oldest president,\u201d which looked at some of those accommodations and concerns for his age, but also the moments where he showed stamina and vigor. Some reporters said that there has been a distinct change\u00a0within the last year, and that the press corps should have reported more aggressively on the accommodations made for the president. \u201cI think the press, most of the White House press, did suffer from a bit of lack of curiosity,\u201d one of the reporters said. Look who you\u2019re up against Biden\u2019s allies will often question coverage of the president\u2019s age, questioning why reporters focus on the president\u2019s age and mental lucidity and not on Trump\u2019s\u00a0\u2013\u00a0who, at 78,\u00a0was observed falling asleep during his hush money trial, has made his own major verbal flubs and bizarre statements, and regularly spouts complete falsehoods. \u201cIt makes sense to reflect on this now and ask whether we missed or, really, under-reported the story of Biden\u2019s age and decline. But it\u2019s complicated,\u201d one of the reporters said. \u201cThe fact that the political alternative to Biden is an authoritarian who sparked an insurrection and is a convicted felon does not mean that the press is failing American democracy to focus on Biden\u2019s obvious frailty.\u201d One of the reporters said the media can, and do, report on both. Biden\u2019s allies, however, say too much attention is placed on Biden\u2019s age and not on the threat Trump could pose to American democracy. But the reporters say they can, and should, do both. \u201cJust because you are reporting on Biden age, doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not reporting on Trump\u2019s lies.\u00a0 I find that argument silly, and it seems one design towards like producing a certain outcome in the election, rather than like an honest reporting,\u201d one of the reporters said. The outlets that had received harsh blowback for their previous reports on Biden\u2019s lucidity now feel justified. A source familiar with the staff behind the Wall Street Journal\u2019s report said that when the piece first published, the reporters were approached by people with sympathy asking how they\u2019re doing \u201cas if something terrible had just happened,\u201d the source said. After the debate, the reporters started to get messages saying they were right.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/media/biden-mental-fitness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "business"}}

In the lawsuit, filed Sunday in New York state court, the president\u2019s sonaccuses Fox News of unjust enrichment, intentionally inflicting emotional distress, and violating New York civil rights laws. The lawsuit makes good on\u00a0Hunter Biden\u2019s threat he made in April that he would take the network to court if it didn\u2019t immediately issue retractions and corrections. The miniseries, \u201cThe Trial of Hunter Biden,\u201d was a six-part offering on the Fox Nation digital streaming network, and was also promoted on Fox News, the cable TV channel. It featured a dramatized \u201cmock trial\u201d about Hunter Biden\u2019s overseas financial dealings that led in part to his federal tax indictment and that also fueled House Republicans\u2019 struggling impeachment inquiry into his father. Fox News\u00a0took down the miniseries\u00a0in late April, one day after Hunter Biden threatened to file a lawsuit. But according to the lawsuit, promotional materials for the miniseries are still on some Fox News-linked social media pages, and the miniseries episodes are still circulating \u201conline and in the public domain.\u201d A Fox News spokesperson claimed the lawsuit was meritless and \u201centirely politically motivated,\u201d and said the network looks forward to \u201cvindicating our rights in court.\u201d \u201cThe core complaint stems from a 2022 streaming program that Mr. Biden did not complain about until sending a letter in late April 2024,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cThe program was removed within days of the letter, in an abundance of caution, but Hunter Biden is a public figure who has been the subject of multiple investigations and is now a convicted felon. Consistent with the First Amendment, Fox News has accurately covered the newsworthy events of Mr. Biden\u2019s own making.\u201d The new lawsuit claims Fox News \u201ctargeted Mr. (Hunter) Biden in an effort to harass, annoy, alarm, and humiliate him, and tarnish his reputation.\u201d President Joe Biden\u2019s son is seeking an unspecified amount of punitive damages, as well as any profits that Fox reaped from the miniseries, and other corrective measures. \u201cThe miniseries is fictionalized; it is not a news event. It was made for the purpose of trade and advertising, and merely exploits Mr. Biden\u2019s name, image, and likeness for Fox\u2019s commercial benefit,\u201d Hunter Biden\u2019s lawyers wrote in the lawsuit. Hunter Biden\u2019s team said in the lawsuit that without his consent, Fox News \u201cunlawfully published numerous intimate images (both still and video) of Mr. Biden depicting him in the nude, depicting an unclothed or exposed intimate part of him, as well as engaged in sex acts.\u201d The right-wing network said these images originated form Hunter Biden\u2019s\u00a0infamous laptop\u00a0\u2013 data from which was leaked by allies for former President Donald Trump in 2020. The president\u2019s son was\u00a0convicted at a trial\u00a0last month on federal gun charges, and faces a second trial this fall on alleged tax crimes. However, he hasn\u2019t been charged in connection with the bribery and foreign lobbying allegations that were at the center of Fox\u2019s \u201cmock trial\u201d series.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/media/hunter-biden-sues-fox-news/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_06_13_success_gallup-workers-economy-lonely-unhappy", "text": "Employees\u2019 negative daily emotions and lack of well-being can ultimately hurt worker engagement \u2013 and the economy, according to a new report released this week. Gallup, in its \u201cState of the Global Workplace,\u201d estimates that low employee engagement costs the global economy $8.9 trillion, or 9% of global GDP. The report includes findings from its latest annual World Poll, which surveyed 128,278 employees in more than 140 countries last year. That poll found that roughly 20% of workers globally reported feeling lonely, angry or sad on a daily basis. And 41% on average say they feel stress. Those most likely to say they feel lonely were younger workers (22%), employees who worked remotely full-time (25%) and those who felt most disengaged on the job (31%). While work isn\u2019t always the cause of a person\u2019s negative daily emotions, employers should still be concerned. That\u2019s because work can either improve or worsen employees\u2019 well-being. On the one hand,\u00a0the Gallup report noted,\u00a0\u201cwhen employees find their work and work relationships meaningful, employment is associated with high levels of daily enjoyment and low levels of all negative daily emotions. Notably, half of employees who are engaged at work are thriving in life overall.\u201d On the other, researchers found that being disengaged at work can negatively affect a person\u2019s wellbeing as much as \u2014 or more than \u2014 not having a job at all. \u201cEmployees who dislike their jobs tend to have high levels of daily stress and worry, as well as elevated levels of all other negative emotions,\u201d they wrote. \u201cOn many wellbeing items (stress, anger, worry, loneliness), being actively disengaged at work is equivalent to or worse than being unemployed.\u201d Engaged managers help workers thrive The poll found that last year only 23% of employees were engaged at work, unchanged from the year prior. Gallup defines an engaged employee as someone \u201chighly involved in and enthusiastic about their work and workplace. They are psychological \u2018owners,\u2019 drive performance and innovation, and move the organization forward.\u201d But those who said they were not engaged rose by 3 percentage points to 62%. These are employees characterized as \u201cpsychologically unattached to their work and company. Because their engagement needs are not being fully met, they are putting time but not energy or passion into their work.\u201d Engagement levels are highest in so-called \u201cbest practice\u201d organizations, where three-fourths of managers on average are engaged as well as seven in 10 non-managers, Gallup said. Their best practices include leaders\u2019 emphasizing well-being at work and in life; and putting a high priority on manager hiring and development. The manager piece of the equation is especially crucial. \u201c[W]hen managers are engaged, employees are more likely to be engaged,\u201d the report said. And, it added, \u201chigh-engagement business units are likely to see significantly higher employee wellbeing \u2014 as well as higher productivity, profitability and sales \u2014 than low-engagement teams.\u201d Where the most and least stressed workers are Engagement and well-being results varied in each of the 10 regions covered by Gallup\u2019s poll. The report noted that the United States and Canada, for example, showed the highest percentage of engaged employees (33%) among all the regions studied; and the third highest percentage of thriving employees (53%), behind Australia and New Zealand (60%) and Latin America and the Caribbean (54%). But the US and Canada also ranked second among employees experiencing daily stress (49%), right behind the Middle East and North Africa (52%). By contrast, Europe showed the lowest level of employee engagement (13%). South Asia scored lowest in terms of employees described as thriving overall (13%). And countries in post-Soviet Eurasia ranked lowest in terms of daily stress (19%).", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/success/gallup-workers-economy-lonely-unhappy/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_09_investing_elon-musk-tesla-legal-fees", "text": "A record $7 billion in attorneys\u2019\u00a0fees for three firms that successfully challenged\u00a0Elon\u00a0Musk\u2019s $56 billion Tesla pay package provides an incentive for lawyers to hold corporate boards accountable, an attorney for a company shareholder told a Delaware judge on Monday. For more than\u00a0six hours,\u00a0legal\u00a0teams for the company and a shareholder sparred over how much to award to three law firms which represented Richard\u00a0Tornetta, who\u00a0owned nine shares\u00a0of Tesla when he sued over\u00a0Musk\u2019s pay package in 2018. The\u00a0fee\u00a0Tornetta has asked for on behalf of the firms\u00a0equals around $7.3 billion at Tesla\u2019s Monday stock price and amounts to a rate of roughly $370,000 for every hour worked by the 37 lawyers, associates and paralegals, court documents submitted by Tornetta\u2019s lawyers\u00a0showed. John Reed, Tesla\u2019s lawyer, said on Monday that the\u00a0fee\u00a0petition never should have been filed. \u201cIt looks like a real-life lawyer joke,\u201d he told Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick of the Court of Chancery. The\u00a0legal\u00a0fee\u00a0represents a cut of the value that the plaintiff\u2019s lawyers say was created\u00a0for Tesla\u00a0by a Delaware judge\u2019s January ruling that rescinded\u00a0Musk\u2019s $56-billion pay package. The firms that represented Tornetta include Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann. Tornetta\u2019s attorney Greg Varallo said the shareholder\u2019s\u00a0legal\u00a0team was seeking far less than the law allows, which is up to 33% of the benefit to Tesla from the lawsuit. He said the January ruling was the largest judgment ever by an American court, excluding punitive damages, and argued that Tornetta\u2019s lawyers should receive 11% of that judgment paid in the form of 29 million Tesla shares. Varallo argued that a large\u00a0fee\u00a0award would encourage shareholder attorneys to try to protect small investors. \u201cIf Delaware continues to perceive value in policing bad behavior, then narrowing incentives would be a very bad idea,\u201d Varallo said. Reed countered that the January ruling destroyed value by sending Tesla\u2019s stock down as it created uncertainty about\u00a0Musk\u2019s future at the company. He asked McCormick to award as little as $13.6 million as a\u00a0fee. More than 8,000 Tesla stockholders have flooded the court with some 1,500 letters and objections over the\u00a0fee, according to court documents. The request vastly outstrips the current record\u00a0fee\u00a0in shareholder litigation of $688 million in an Enron class action, according to Stanford Law School. The\u00a0Musk\u00a0case took a dramatic turn when Tesla shareholders in June voted to ratify\u00a0Musk\u2019s pay, which Tesla has argued corrected the flaws in the 2018 process that McCormick identified in her ruling. The company argues that\u00a0Musk\u2019s pay package has been restored and that Tornetta\u2019s\u00a0legal\u00a0victory has been transformed into a loss. McCormick will hear arguments about the\u00a0legal\u00a0impact of the ratification vote in the coming weeks. McCormick may take weeks or months to rule on the\u00a0legal\u00a0fee. The Delaware Supreme Court is considering a\u00a0$267 million\u00a0fee\u00a0request\u00a0in a shareholder class action involving Dell Technologies and that decision could provide\u00a0fee\u00a0guidance.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/investing/elon-musk-tesla-legal-fees/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_08_business_mcdonalds-menu-salads", "text": "McDonald\u2019s once poured big marketing dollars into its salads. But since 2020, greens have been off the menu. That\u2019s because the chain has concluded that when people go to McDonald\u2019s, they mostly want a burger and fries. \u201cIf people really want salads from McDonald\u2019s we will gladly relaunch salads,\u201d said Joe Erlinger, the president of McDonald\u2019s USA, in a June interview at the Wall Street Journal\u2019s annual Global Food Forum. \u201cBut what our experience has proven is that\u2019s not what the consumer\u2019s looking for from McDonald\u2019s,\u201d he added. \u201cThey\u2019re looking for great french fries, they\u2019re looking for a $5 meal deal, they\u2019re looking for a hot fresh sandwich. And so, that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to continue to provide them.\u201d Serving a healthy meal \u2014 or one fit for vegetarians, vegans or children \u2014 can help fast food chains avoid a so-called \u201cveto vote,\u201d which involves a group or family skipping a restaurant that doesn\u2019t have options for picky eaters or ones with dietary restrictions. For McDonald\u2019s, putting salads on the menu was likely a way to avoid the veto vote and stay atop recent healthy food trends. McDonald\u2019s had been serving salads for decades prior to the pandemic. Salads made it possible for some to eat at the chain while watching their diets (as one diet blogger noted, \u201cthe salads were the only half-healthy item\u00a0I could eat at McDonald\u2019s.\u201d) For others, it may have been more of a way to feel like they were eating healthy, even if they weren\u2019t. But in 2018, salads became more of a liability than a draw. That year, hundreds of people were sickened with an intestinal illness caused by consuming contaminated food or water. McDonald\u2019s salads were \u201cone likely source of these infections,\u201d the CDC said at the time. During the outbreak, the chain stopped selling its salads at 3,000 restaurants as a precautionary measure. And then, two years later, Covid hit, and restaurants facing labor shortages and tangled supply chains slimmed down their menus to focus on their most popular items. McDonald\u2019s removed salads from national menus in 2020 to help simplify restaurant operations, the company said. In 2022, the chain gave its franchise operators the option of serving pre-made salads but many decided not to, the Wall Street Journal reported. The strategy paid off. Sales ballooned as the chain came up with ways to update and market their core items. And now, the chain is focusing its efforts on convincing customers  to choose their $5 meal deal, rather than a competitor\u2019s, while the salad has been left behind. Another menu item that\u2019s not coming to McDonald\u2019s any time soon? A plant-based burger, which McDonald\u2019s tested a few years ago. \u201cI don\u2019t think the US consumer is \u2026 looking for McPlant or other plant-based proteins from McDonald\u2019s now,\u201d Erlinger said at the June conference, but added that \u201cit\u2019s a trend that we\u2019ll continue to monitor.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/business/mcdonalds-menu-salads/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_17_success_how-to-find-good-affordable-colleges", "text": "Long before you take your high schooler on college campus tours, consider this: Shopping for college shouldn\u2019t be any different than shopping for a home.\u00a0When you want to buy a home, you come up with a range of how much you can afford and get pre-qualified for a mortgage. Then you look in neighborhoods that offer homes that meet your family\u2019s needs and fall within your price range. \u201cAdopt a mindset that we\u2019re buying college like we\u2019re buying a house,\u201d said Beth Walker, author of \u201cBuying College Better\u201d and \u201cNever Pay Retail for College.\u201d As a financial adviser and certified\u00a0college planning specialist, Walker tries to help families avoid a situation that many find themselves in at the 11th hour: Their child applies \u2014 and gets into \u2014 schools they cannot afford because the schools won\u2019t give them enough aid. And then they just \u2026 try to make it work, no matter how much debt is involved for the parents or the student. Instead, she advises families to start as early as 9th or 10th grade in figuring out what is affordable for them as a family \u2014 so parents don\u2019t sacrifice their own financial welfare and the future college student doesn\u2019t drown in debt upon graduation. And second, she recommends assessing how a child\u2019s talents and interests pare with majors and careers they might want to pursue. Doing both those things can help you target the right colleges to apply to. Mike McKinnon, executive director of the National Institute of Certified College Planners, defines the perfect college as one \u201cwhere a student can go be happy, safe and successful, graduate in four years or less with a marketable degree and little or no debt.\u201d In helping families align parents\u2019 affordability constraints with their student\u2019s academic and social needs, he cautions them not to automatically assume the Ivys or other high-prestige schools will be best simply because of their status. And he stresses what success in life looks like after college and notes that an Ivy League degree isn\u2019t the only path to achieving it, especially if your child won\u2019t get much aid to attend. In fact, said Todd Fothergill, founder and CEO of Strategies for College, a lot of brand-name schools don\u2019t even offer merit-based aid, only need-based. So if you\u2019re not rich, but you make too much to qualify for need-based aid, you could find yourself having to cover the entire cost of tuition, room and board every year, which is pushing $90,000 at some US colleges. Set up financial guardrails well before the college search Fothergill created a free calculator called CostHero that lets parents assess what financial resources they will have available to pay for a child\u2019s college education. It then provides a range of affordability: At the low end is the number representing what they can pay if they don\u2019t take on debt. And at the high end is the number they can pay if they also take out an unsubsidized federal Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students (PLUS). \u201cIf you\u2019re not in a position to write a check for $90,000 a year, put up guardrails for yourself so you don\u2019t blow up your retirement,\u201d he said. The calculator inputs let you set the amount of resources you\u2019re willing to use to pay for college from your income and savings, your child\u2019s earnings from summer jobs, any family gifts, and any federal Stafford loans your child may take. It also factors in if you qualify for the federal American Opportunity Tax Credit. That credit, for qualified educational expenses, will reduce your tax bill or increase any refund you have coming. The calculator also gives you a debt-to-income score like the kind a mortgage lender might use to assess whether you\u2019re a good credit risk. Ideally, he said, you don\u2019t want your housing costs to exceed 36% of your gross income and your total debt \u2014 including debt from housing, cars, credit cards and any parental education loans \u2014 to exceed 43%. If your DTI ratio is close to or higher than 43% that is a sign you could get yourself into trouble if you end up having any financial problems while your child is in college, Fothergill said. \u201cIf folks have a way to determine the range of affordability prior to the onset of the college search, the outcomes are a lot better.\u00a0 For example, if one knows that the range of affordability is between $30,000 [a year] with no parent debt and $50,000 with parent debt, then any college that comes in with a net cost in that range is, by definition, affordable,\u201d Fothergill said. Net cost refers to the true cost of attendance after figuring out how much aid your child may get (e.g., grants and scholarships). Figure out where your student may qualify for the most aid Generally speaking, the biggest tuition discounts go to the most academically accomplished students in an incoming class. \u201cThe student needs to be in the top 25% of those admitted,\u201d Walker said. Getting into that top 25% cohort is based on SAT or ACT scores, and having a high, unweighted GPA based on a rigorous high school curriculum. The curriculum\u2019s academic rigor can be further bolstered by taking AP courses. Since your child is more likely to make the top quartile at some schools than others, Fothergill and Walker both recommend your child focus on applying only to those schools in which they stand the best chances of being in that top group to maximize their chances for merit-based aid. Otherwise, you\u2018ll spend money to apply to guidance-counselor-recommended \u201csafety\u201d schools or \u201creach\u201d schools with no sense if those places are affordable to you should your child get in. Using reported data from admissions officers about their key criteria in admitting an incoming class and based on what more than 1,000 schools report about the qualifications they used to grant aid, Fothergill created another tool called ListHero. It gives students a score that helps gauge\u00a0how competitive their profile is\u00a0at a given school, relative to others admitted, and by extension their eligibility for tuition discounts. Right now the tool is only available to college planning professionals for a fee. But Fothergill plans to create a free mini-version for consumers to use. For parents doing their own research on test scores, GPA requirements, costs and aid, he recommends checking the Department of Education College Scorecard, the site CollegeData.com and the College Board. Other ways to reduce college costs before applying While your children are in high school they can take other steps to reduce the total cost of their education. One way is by doing well on the PSAT to qualify to compete for a National Merit Scholarship. Another is to take AP courses. If their high school doesn\u2019t offer them, there is a program called Freshman Year for Free offered by the Modern States Education Alliance. It provides free AP placement courses and pays the fee for students to take the AP tests or college-level preparation (CLEP) tests administered through the College Board. Getting the minimum AP scores a college requires to earn a college credit will lower how much you ultimately have to spend on tuition. A third option is to see if your state has a program that offers a year of free in-state community college, the credits from which can be transferred to a state university from which your child could earn their degree. Or, if you plan to go to any other college, make sure the school will accept the credits from a community college course you plan to take. No matter what steps you take, starting the research and budgeting process early can save everyone a lot of stress, debt and potential heartache in the end.

{"id": "2023_11_21_opinions_sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic", "text": "The biggest tech news this week is the\u00a0ouster\u00a0of Sam Altman from his role as CEO of OpenAI, a move that has shaken the company and the industry. Hundreds of OpenAI employees have threatened to\u00a0resign. Altman has already\u00a0moved on\u00a0to a role at Microsoft. And OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is on its\u00a0third CEO\u00a0in as many days. It\u2019s all very juicy. But this drama should also be raising larger questions, far beyond one company\u2019s internal hirings and firings, including: Who are the people making the decisions\u00a0that will determine so much of our technological future? What guiding principles are they using to make those decisions? And how should other institutions \u2013 governments, non-tech industries, global alliances, regulatory bodies \u2013 reign in the worst excesses of potentially dangerous AI innovators? OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, with an explicit mission to harness what may soon be superhuman intelligence \u201cto benefit humanity as a whole.\u201d But that sensibility hasn\u2019t lasted. The company now has a multi-billion-dollar for-profit arm. They have been developing new technologies at lightning speed, and sometimes sending them out to the public\u00a0before some employees believed they were ready. The company has already reportedly invented an AI technology so dangerous they will never release it \u2013 but they also\u00a0won\u2019t tell\u00a0reporters or the public exactly what it is. This dynamic \u2013 a potentially dangerous technology developed at extreme speed, largely behind closed doors \u2013 is partly to blame for Altman\u2019s firing. The OpenAI board, according to\u00a0CNN\u2019s David Goldman, worried that \u201cthe company was making the technological equivalent of a nuclear bomb, and its caretaker, Sam Altman, was moving so fast that he risked a global catastrophe.\u201d At particular issue seemed to be Altman\u2019s efforts to make the tools behind ChatGPT available to anyone who wanted to make their own version of the chatbot. This could be widely disastrous, some board members worried. But then they fired him without warning, and apparently without involving Microsoft, the company\u2019s largest shareholder. Now, Altman is at the new AI group at Microsoft, and one has to wonder if the oversight and caution there will be on par with that at OpenAI, or if he\u2019ll be handed carte blanche to push as fast and hard as he wants. And for all the justified reticence of the OpenAI board, the company has carried out much of its work in secrecy \u2013 without the public really understanding what a handful of unaccountable technologists are building, and how it is nearly guaranteed to indelibly change their lives. AI is broadly understood to have the potential to reshape vast swaths of human existence. At the very least, it seems nearly guaranteed to change how we process information, how we communicate, how we learn and how we work (and if we work). And the ramifications could be much more extreme. AI technologies have already demonstrated the ability\u00a0to lie and to cover their tracks. They have already been able to\u00a0suggest the design\u00a0to make a virus spread more quickly. Many researchers\u00a0acutely understand\u00a0just how quickly these machines could develop the capacity to annihilate us, including Altman: He has a prepper\u2019s paradise prepared in Big Sur, complete with guns and \u201cgas masks from the Israeli Defense Force\u201d in case AI goes off the rails and the robots go to war against humans,\u00a0according to reporting in the New Yorker. But don\u2019t worry, he told an Atlantic reporter: If AI is determined to wipe us out, \u201cno gas mask is helping anyone.\u201d (If you want an excellent and terrifying rundown of AI\u2019s risks \u2013 at least those we understand right now, which are almost certainly a mere sliver of the looming perils \u2013\u00a0the Atlantic profile of Altman and his technology\u00a0is worth a read). AI is very exciting technology. But it is also a potentially very dangerous one, and not in the social media sense of \u201cit may give us bad self-esteem and make us lonelier\u201d but in the sense of \u201cit could break down human societies and kill us all.\u201d Given the life-altering potential of AI \u2013 that even if it doesn\u2019t kill us all, it will almost certainly change human existence in unprecedented ways at unprecedented speed \u2013 we all have a stake in how it\u2019s being developed. And yet the development is being left to a handful of people (who seem to be\u00a0largely\u00a0men) in Silicon Valley, and other tech pockets around the globe. And we all have a stake in whose interests AI will serve \u2013 and right now, its development is being funded with billions of dollars by people expecting to make a huge profit. Do the interests of the public align with the interests of the shareholders to whom profit-driven, potentially tremendously lucrative-for-a-few companies are beholden? Or with the interests of tech entrepreneurs who are primarily excited about being at the forefront of the AI revolution, regardless of the potential human costs? One thing is clear: AI is coming. And how it is built and unleashed on the public matters more than perhaps any technology of the past century. It is, indeed, up there with the atom bomb in its destructive potential \u2013 except likely more difficult to regulate and control. \u201cRegulation\u201d does not begin to scratch the surface of what\u2019s needed to make sure that the AI future is not a catastrophic one, especially since the development of AI is now a massive international arms race, with particularly horrific implications if bad actors develop this technology first. But regulation is, at minimum, a necessary step. So is transparency: In the US, companies have wide leverage to work behind a veil of secrecy, and much of what AI companies do is kept secret to stymy competition. But the public certainly has a right to understand what life-altering technologies are set to be inflicted upon us, and what the creators are doing to protect humanity \u2013 our jobs, our communities, our families, our connections, our educations and our abilities to build a life of purpose, but also our lives and our safety. The Altman story is fascinating because Altman is the most powerful figure in AI technology, which in effect makes him one of the most powerful men in the world. But that should give us pause: Who is he, what power does he hold, what is he doing with it, who does he answer to, and are we comfortable with this much life-altering potential being held by a few unaccountable people?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/21/opinions/sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_08_business_smartmatic-reid-hoffman-fox-news", "text": "LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman is providing significant financial firepower to Smartmatic as the voting technology company fights Fox News and Newsmax over the right-wing networks\u2019 repeated airing of 2020 election lies. Hoffman, a billionaire venture capitalist and prominent Democratic donor, framed his multimillion-dollar investment in Smartmatic as a way to strengthen the company\u2019s global operations as it pursues the costly defamation lawsuits. \u201cSmartmatic built a global business by using technology to better engage citizens, regardless of party or ideology, by making voting simple and trustworthy,\u201d Hoffman said in a statement. \u201cAfter Donald Trump lost in 2020, however, Smartmatic became a target of the defamatory campaign to overturn his defeat.\u201d Hoffman, who said he has known Smartmatic CEO Antonio Mugica for years, said he is \u201cthrilled\u201d to support Smartmatic and help Mugica recover \u201cwhat he is owed.\u201d Terms of the investment, first\u00a0reported\u00a0by The Washington Post, were not disclosed. A\u00a0person with knowledge of the matter wouldn\u2019t say exactly how much money Hoffman poured into Smartmatic but told CNN the eight-figure investment surpassed $10 million. \u201cThis isn\u2019t litigation financing,\u201d the person said, adding that Hoffman \u201cthinks the company is massively undervalued\u201d and will make money off his investment if Smartmatic does well in the future. Furthermore, while Hoffman\u2019s investment is significant, he \u201cdoesn\u2019t have the power\u201d to order Smartmatic\u2019s lawyers to settle the lawsuits, the person added. \u201cFox\u2019s strategy was to spend us into the ground,\u201d the person said. \u201cThis is the response.\u201d The investment comes as\u00a0Hoffman steps up his criticism\u00a0of Trump. The\u00a0LinkedIn co-founder told CNN\u00a0earlier this month that business leaders are scared to speak out against Trump for fear that the presumptive Republican nominee will retaliate. Hoffman argued that President Joe Biden is the more \u201cpro-business\u201d candidate because he respects the rule of law and Trump does not. Mugica, the Smartmatic CEO, welcomed the support from Hoffman. \u201cThe lies told by Fox News and Newsmax have not only defamed and damaged our business, they have also directly attacked the integrity of the nonpartisan civic work we have supported over more than two decades,\u201d Mugica said in a statement. Smartmatic is seeking billions of dollars in damages from Fox News, Newsmax and other right-wing figures that falsely accused the company of rigging the 2020 election. On social media and in TV interviews, top Donald Trump allies repeatedly claimed, with no proof, that Smartmatic software fraudulently flipped millions of votes from Trump to Biden. The voting technology company\u2019s defamation lawsuit\u00a0against Fox News\u00a0is still in the fact-finding \u201cdiscovery\u201d phase and isn\u2019t expected to go to trial until 2025. Earlier this year, the New York judge overseeing the case\u00a0allowed\u00a0Smartmatic to broaden its lawsuit to include Fox Corporation, the parent company of the cable news juggernaut. The Smartmatic-Newsmax lawsuit is\u00a0slated for trial in September\u00a0in Delaware Superior Court, unless there is a last-minute settlement. And the small pro-Trump propaganda network\u00a0One America News recently\u00a0settled a\u00a0lawsuit brought by Smartmatic\u00a0over similar allegations. All of these media outlets and Trump allies deny wrongdoing. A spokesperson for Fox News Media claimed Smartmatic is trying to \u201cto chill First Amendment freedoms\u201d with its lawsuit, \u201cso their alliance with a high profile Democratic donor and longtime supporter of President Biden to fund their lawsuit is entirely predictable.\u201d \u201cWe remain ready to defend this case surrounding extremely newsworthy events when it goes to trial next year,\u201d the spokesperson added. In response to Hoffman\u2019s investment, a Newsmax lawyer told CNN that the company \u201creported fairly on both sides of the 2020 election.\u201d The lawyer also noted that Smartmatic executives were recently\u00a0implicated by the Justice Department\u00a0in a bribery scheme involving a top Philippines election official. Smartmatic denies the allegations. Smartmatic is also suing Trump 2020 campaign lawyer Sidney Powell and MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell \u2013 two of the most egregious peddlers of election disinformation. A representative for Powell did not immediately respond to requests for comment. \u201cIt seems that Mr. Hoffman is trying to take a page out of the Fox settlement, and copying Staple Street\u2019s investment in Dominion, to get a quick return,\u201d Lindell attorney Christopher Kachouroff said, referring to the private equity firm that owns a majority stake in Dominion and benefitted from its $787 million settlement with Fox News.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/business/smartmatic-reid-hoffman-fox-news/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_08_media_paramount-global-skydance-merger-announcement", "text": "Paramount Global\u2014the sprawling media empire behind CBS,\u00a0MTV, and one of Hollywood\u2019s most storied movie studios\u2014has agreed to merge with technology scion David Ellison\u2019s Skydance Media,\u00a0ending years of speculation over the company\u2019s fate. The deal\u00a0announced late Sunday\u00a0comes just weeks after a previous offer from Ellison to acquire Paramount collapsed in the eleventh\u00a0hour, stunning industry observers and raising questions about the beleaguered media company\u2019s future. The agreement\u00a0cements Ellison as a media mogul, ending Shari Redstone\u2019s control of Paramount through her family\u2019s National Amusements holding company, after her father, the late Sumner Redstone, won a fierce bidding war to piece together the media conglomerate beginning in the 1980s. The complicated transaction will see Skydance first buy National Amusements, then merge with Paramount, valuing Skydance at $4.75 billion. Ellison\u2019s production company\u00a0will \u201cinvest $2.4 billion to acquire National Amusements for cash and $4.5 billion for the stock/cash merger consideration to be paid for publicly traded Class A shares and Class B shares, as well as $1.5 billion of primary capital to be added to Paramount\u2019s balance sheet,\u201d it said. The combined company will be helmed by Ellison as chief executive and former NBCUniversal chief Jeff Shell as president. In a call with investors Monday morning, Ellison and Shell laid out their strategy for Paramount, aiming to become a \u201ctechnological leader\u201d in the streaming space, and announcing reorganization plans that will include $2 billion in cost cuts.\u201cWe love the creative engine of this company, but obviously a big chunk of the company is in the linear world \u2014 and we know that linear is challenged and declining,\u201d Shell said. \u201cI think a lot of us in the business know we\u2019ve got to run these businesses in a different way as they decline.\u201d The deal caps a tumultuous and protracted saga that began in December, with the two companies entering into exclusive negotiations in April, resulting in\u00a0the ouster\u00a0of longtime Paramount chief executive Bob Bakish. In the meantime, the company has been run by a triumvirate of leaders: Brian Robbins, chief executive of Paramount Pictures; Chris McCarthy, chief executive of Showtime and MTV Entertainment Studios; and George Cheeks, chief executive of CBS. While legacy media companies have struggled in recent years, Paramount, with its extensive portfolio of cable channels including MTV and Comedy Central, has been heavily exposed to the earthshaking consumer shift away from the traditional television model to streaming services. As services like Netflix exploded in popularity, millions of people abandoned cable packages in favor of lower-priced on-demand streaming shows and movies. Paramount, with its heavy reliance on the television business, was caught flat-footed. In an attempt to stave off declining cable revenues, Paramount spent billions building its own streaming service, Paramount+. But\u00a0it was late to the game, and\u00a0like the rival streaming platforms erected by other legacy media companies, the service has struggled to gain enough traction with consumers to supplement its losses in the linear television business. The iconic company\u2019s valuation has also plunged amid the turmoil, with shares of Paramount falling more than\u00a075% in the last five years.\u00a0At a company town hall last month, Robbins acknowledged it had been a turbulent period as questions swirled over the conglomerate\u2019s future. \u201cWe\u2019d like to take a moment to acknowledge the challenges of all the M&A speculation surrounding our company. We know what a difficult and disruptive period it has been,\u201d Robbins said. \u201cAnd while we cannot say that the noise will disappear, we are here today to lay out a go-forward plan that can set us up for success no matter what path the company chooses to go down.\u201d While Redstone had been approached in recent years to sell off pieces of Paramount\u2019s extensive media portfolio, including Showtime and the cable network BET, several high-priced deals to break up the company were ultimately rejected. In recent months, as takeover offers for Paramount began to once again heat up, Sony Pictures and\u00a0the private equity firm\u00a0Apollo Global Management offered a $26 billion deal that would have made Sony the majority shareholder and Apollo the minority shareholder.\u00a0But the deal would have resulted in the breakup of Paramount, a prospect that Redstone rejected over her strong attachment to the\u00a0company\u00a0that her father had spent decades building. The sale to Skydance Media, founded in 2010 by David Ellison, son of Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison, offered Redstone an offer she couldn\u2019t refuse: billions in cash and the comfort of selling the family company to the heir of another titan who has promised to invest into Paramount\u2019s future. Skydance and Paramount also had a deep established relationship, partnering\u00a0in recent years\u00a0to produce some of the box office\u2019s biggest blockbusters, including \u201cTop Gun: Maverick\u201d and \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d films. \u201cGiven the changes in the industry, we want to fortify Paramount for the future while ensuring that content remains king,\u201d Redstone said in a statement. \u201cOur hope is that the Skydance transaction will enable Paramount\u2019s continued success in this rapidly changing environment.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/media/paramount-global-skydance-merger-announcement/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "business"}}

The vibe is trail-dad chic \u2014 think puffy Patagonia vests and Apple watches and stealth-wealth cashmere pullovers. Imagine the resort from Dirty Dancing but replace all the beautiful young dancers with mostly older White men carrying Wall Street Journals under their arms and grumbling about regulatory overreach. It is a real romp. The summit\u2019s agenda and lecture topics are kept secret, and reporters who attend generally have to stay off the record so that the one-percenters can mingle and speak freely as they wander the mountain resort, gossiping about industry and, occasionally, forging historic multibillion-dollar deals. Sun Valley is also widely believed to be the place where Jeff Bezos decided to buy The Washington Post, and the site of the meet-cute between Comcast and NBC Universal. (Warren Buffett, who is notably absent from this year\u2019s guest list, once referred to Sun Valley dealmaking as ABWA, or \u201cacquisitions by walking around.\u201d) This year\u2019s parade of private jets is expected to touch down Tuesday, as the Idaho Mountain Express reported last month, bringing together dozens of power brokers \u2014 including AI kingpin Sam Altman; Disney CEO Bob Iger and a coterie of his potential successors; plus all of the usual suspects like Apple\u2019s Tim Cook, Meta\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, Google\u2019s Sundar Pichai, media moguls Rupert Murdoch and Oprah Winfrey and many others, including David Zaslav, the CEO of CNN\u2019s parent company Warner Bros. Discovery, according to Bloomberg and Variety. (A spokesperson for Warner Bros. Discovery confirmed Zaslav would attend.) There are also some notably absent names from the guest list this year. There\u2019s Buffett, who is normally a fixture at the event but who is nearly 94 and, perhaps, happy to let his spryer successor, 62-year-old Greg Abel, handle the high-altitude trekking and chit-chattery. Less likely but still half-seriously rumored is that Buffett is avoiding the shindig after the press last year picked up on his wife, Astrid, complaining about having to pay $4 for a cup of coffee. Also absent this year is Elon Musk, who might seem like a shoo-in until you imagine him winding up on a rafting trip with a bunch of CEOs whom he publicly urged, less than a year ago, to go f\u2014 themselves. While we expect plenty of chatter about artificial intelligence, the Succession-level drama about Iger\u2019s succession plan, and the head-spinning negotiations that led to the Paramount-Skydance merger, there is one giant elephant \u2014 or donkey \u2014 in the room this year. Questions about President Joe Biden\u2019s ability to campaign have wealthy donors and Democratic officials in a tizzy. And it would be hard to imagine that a gaggle of elite media moguls would sit around the fire with their s\u2019mores and bourbon and not speculate about potential replacements on the 2024 ballot. That could make the week particularly important for three governors on the guest list this year: Gretchen Whitmer, Josh Shapiro and Wes Moore, all of whom have been floated as potential Biden replacements, even as the president forcefully denies that he\u2019s contemplating dropping out. The political intrigue is, well, intriguing. But it\u2019s also a timely reminder to zoom out and consider just how powerful the US has let its billionaire class become, and how events like Sun Valley amplify the inequities in America that are so systemic we hardly bat an eye at them. As the writer Hamilton Nolan wrote in 2021, Sun Valley is a place where \u201cthe billionaires are feted by the mere millionaires; the millionaires drum up enough deals to allow them to buy their third and fourth homes \u2026 This is the wondrous model of American capitalism in action \u2014 a tiny handful of wealthy people eat cake, and an entire nation gathers downstream, hoping to snatch up a few falling crumbs.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/business/sun-valley-summer-camp-billionaires-nightcap/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "business"}}

In May 2023, Tempur Sealy \u2013 the world\u2019s largest mattress supplier and manufacturer \u2013 agreed to buy the United States\u2019 largest bedding retailer in a roughly $4 billion deal. The FTC authorized a lawsuit in federal court to block the acquisition. The Commission said that the proposed deal would suppress competition and raise prices for mattress buyers, and give the companies \u201cenormous power\u201d in the mattress supply chain. The FTC also said that documents showed that competing mattress suppliers would lose access to its most important retail channel. These suppliers employ thousands of American workers, it said. \u201cThrough emails, presentations, and other deal documents, Tempur Sealy has made it abundantly clear that its acquisition of Mattress Firm is intended to kneecap competitors and dominate the market,\u201d said Henry Liu, Director of the FTC\u2019s Bureau of Competition in a press release. \u201cThis deal isn\u2019t about creating efficiencies; it\u2019s about crippling the competition, which would raise prices on an essential good and could lead to layoffs for good paying American manufacturing jobs in nearly a dozen states.\u201d The deal would have given the combined company 3,000 stores and 71 manufacturing facilities and was expected to close in the second half of 2024. Tempur Sealy\u2019s portfolio includes Tempur-Pedic, Sealy and Stearns and Foster. The deal was seen as beneficial for both parties by analysts, because mattress and furniture sales\u00a0have slowed following a pandemic-induced high, when consumers splurged heavily on home furnishings. Mattress Firm was already dealing with its own financial issues,\u00a0including a 2018 bankruptcy.\u00a0The retailer struggled with over-expansion and online competitors, including Casper and Amazon. The FTC alleges that the reduced competition in the premium mattress space would harm the substantial portion of those mattress buyers \u2013 \u201cworking class, older adults\u201d who often rely on financing. The purchase could drive rivals, which include Serta Simmons Bedding and Purple Innovation, Inc., out of business, the FTC warned. \u201cFor example, the combined firm could limit present and future rivals\u2019 access to Mattress Firm\u2019s floor space, award sales associates higher commissions on Tempur Sealy products sold, or otherwise take steps designed to steer customers away from competitors\u2019 products and toward Tempur Sealy\u2019s mattresses,\u201d the FTC said. In a statement, Tempur Sealy said the bedding industry is \u201chighly competitive\u201d and only a small fraction of brick-and-mortar storefronts are Mattress Firms. It also said it believes a litigation process will be complete in the next few months, and it still expects to close the transaction in late 2024 or early 2025. \u201cTempur Sealy has been working constructively with the FTC to secure regulatory approval for this transaction and is disappointed that the FTC has initiated litigation. We appreciate their efforts to understand the industry and the proposed transaction, but ultimately believe the FTC\u2019s perspective does not reflect all the relevant facts and law,\u201d the statement said. Mattress Firm similarly said it was disappointed in a statement, and said it \u201ccontinues to believe that the transaction with Tempur Sealy will be beneficial to consumers and employees as well as the overall bedding and furniture industry.\u201d This story has been updated with additional context.

The relatively low listing price for a home on nearly 4 million square feet of property, while surprising to a Boston native used to sharply higher real estate prices (some studio apartments in Boston are sold for more money), may not come as a shock to residents of West Virginia. \u201cHere in West Virginia, you can get 90 acres for under half a million dollars,\u201d Sansalone told CNN. Owning a home is often touted as core to the American dream \u2013 but the ease with which a person is able to buy one is highly correlated to the wealth of the state where they live. When comparing personal wealth data with homeownership, a curious pattern emerges: Many states with high homeownership rates have lower income levels and vice versa. Demographics, competition for homes and strict zoning regulations all play a role in the cost of real estate. According to Federal Reserve data, West Virginia\u2019s average personal income of $52,585 per capita is the second-lowest in the US. However, despite its relatively low personal income levels, it has the highest homeownership rate of all 50 states, at 77%, according to US census data. Mississippi\u2014the only state with a lower average personal income than West Virginia\u2014has the third-highest homeownership rate in the country. Although there are some outliers, the trend is apparent: Cities tip the scales when it comes to homeownership Mike Simonsen, founder of real estate analytics firm Altos Research, recently pointed out the inverse relationship between wealth and homeownership on social media. He told CNN that the relationship surprised him. \u201cI would have expected that the more wealthy a place is, the more likely that its people can afford a home,\u201d he said. \u201cIt turns out the opposite is true.\u201d New York, California and Massachusetts have some of the highest levels of personal income yet count themselves among the states with the lowest homeownership rates. One of the main reasons for this low homeownership, according to Simonsen and others, is that those states all contain major cities, which attract a younger, more mobile population and offer more rental and multi-family living options compared to rural areas. \u201cBig cities attract people who are in transition or the growth stage of their lives. They\u2019re more interested in renting, or they may be more transient,\u201d Simonsen said. Many of these cities, such as New York City and San Francisco, also attract buyers from across the US and internationally, bidding up the price of homes. According to the Federal Reserve, the median sales price of houses sold in the US was $420,800 as of the first quarter. A scroll through Zillow listings shows many three- and four-bedroom homes for sale in West Virginia under $200,000.  But the average value of a home in Manhattan\u00a0is $1,102,025 and $1,299,639 in San Francisco, according to Zillow.  There\u2019s another reason that big cities skew the data. Laurie Goodman, the founder of the Housing Policy Center at the Urban Institute, said large cities and their surrounding suburbs also have strict zoning laws that dictate how land may be used. \u201cZoning makes land much more expensive because you\u2019re restricting the use of it,\u201d Goodman said. She added that land is very scarce in large cities, driving up the cost of buying a home even further. A growing number of local and state governments, led by both Democrats and Republicans, have begun to rethink zoning laws in response to the nationwide housing shortage. Some local governments have even begun loosening laws to convert vacated office spaces into affordable housing. The number of apartments in US cities scheduled to be converted from old office spaces has more than quadrupled in the last four years, from 12,100 in 2020 to 55,300 in 2024, according to a recent report from RentCafe, a real estate research company. The trend is most prominent in Washington DC, New York and Dallas, the report said. Governments are getting creative in their attempts to create new housing in other ways: In September, New York City Mayor Eric Adams announced an effort to eliminate mandates that parking spaces be included with new construction, freeing up space to build more homes. \u201cFor more than 60 years, we have added layers upon layers of regulations, effectively outlawing the kinds of housing that our city has long relied on,\u201d Adams said in a statement at the time. Homes are getting more expensive, no matter the state Despite the relatively high homeownership rates in some states, the US is experiencing a historically difficult home affordability crisis. Home prices have jumped 47% since early 2020, growing faster than household income, according to a June report from Harvard University\u2019s Joint Center for Housing Studies. Stephanie Moulton, a professor of housing and urban economics at Ohio State University, said that differences in homeownership by state don\u2019t diminish the fact that it\u2019s becoming less affordable to own a home in most areas of the country. \u201cWe know that owning a home is, for better or worse, the primary mode by which people build wealth in our country,\u201d Moulton said. Elevated mortgage rates have also helped fuel one of the most costly housing markets in decades. Even West Virginia, which counts three out of every four housing units in the state as owner-occupied, isn\u2019t insulated, Sansalone said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a change in our markets,\u201d she said. \u201cHome prices are going up here, just as they are across the country. It is a bit more difficult for buyers right now.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/homes/mississippi-west-virginia-home-ownership-rates/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "business"}}

Lomax said the station prides itself on being an independent, trustworthy voice for its primary audience of Black Philadelphians and that using questions that were provided ahead of time \u201cjeopardizes that trust and is not a practice that WURD Radio engages in or endorses as a matter of practice or official policy.\u201d \u201cWURD Radio is not a mouthpiece for the Biden or any other Administration,\u201d she added. Lawful-Sanders, who hosted \u201cThe Source,\u201d spoke with Biden last week and asked him four questions about what\u2019s at stake in this election, his accomplishments, his debate performance and what he would say to hesitant voters. In an interview Saturday with CNN\u2019s Victor Blackwell, she said those questions were part of eight that were recommended to her by Biden aides ahead of the interview. \u201cThe questions were sent to me for approval. I approved them,\u201d she said. The move has further inflamed the maelstrom that has been swirling over Biden\u2019s acuity since his lackluster performance in the first presidential debate, which was hosted by CNN. Biden\u2019s debate performance has left many top Democrats wringing their hands in frustration and concern amid talk that he should not accept the party\u2019s nomination. \u201cIf the White House is trying now to prove the vim, vigor \u2026 of the president, I don\u2019t know how they do that by sending questions first before the interview so that the president knows what\u2019s coming,\u201d said Blackwell.

These questions were relevant to the news of the day \u2014 the president was asked about this debate performance as well as what he\u2019d delivered for black Americans,\u201d spokesperson Lauren Hitt said in a statement.

NBC announced on Wednesday it will use AI software to recreate Michaels\u2019 voice to deliver daily recaps of the Summer Games for subscribers of its Peacock streaming platform, a milestone for the use of AI by a major media company. The use of an AI voice for the Olympics comes as the technology has grown by leaps and bounds, particularly in its ability to create images, sound and text. That, in turn, has raised questions in creative industries, such as journalism, about how artificial intelligence can \u2013 or even should \u2013 be used. A new tool, called \u201cYour Daily Olympic Recap on Peacock,\u201d will enable 10-minute highlights packages, which can include events updates, athlete back stories and other related content personalized by subscriber preferences. The company said the highlights could be packaged in about 7 million different ways, pulled from 5,000 hours of live coverage in Paris, effectively making AI (the artificial intelligence, not the man) a significantly more efficient way to deliver personalized recaps.  \u201cWhen I was approached about this, I was skeptical but obviously curious,\u201d Michaels said in a press release. \u201cThen I saw a demonstration detailing what they had in mind.

{"id": "2024_04_23_cars_electric-vehicle-sales-forecast-iea", "text": "Global electric vehicle sales are set to rise by more than a fifth to reach 17 million this year, powered by drivers in China, according to the International Energy Agency. In a report Tuesday, the IEA projected that \u201csurging demand\u201d for EVs over the next decade was set \u201cto remake the global auto industry and significantly reduce oil consumption for road transport.\u201d It expects half of all cars sold globally to be electric by 2035, up from more than one in five this year, provided charging infrastructure keeps pace. The IEA includes battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid vehicles in its definition of EVs. The agency\u2019s bullish long-term outlook for EVs \u2014 based on current government policies \u2014 comes just days after the world\u2019s biggest battery EV maker Tesla slashed its prices in major markets to counter declining sales and growing competition from Chinese upstarts and established carmakers. Recent negative headlines about slowing EV penetration are out of step with positive global trends, according to IEA executive director Fatih Birol. The data \u201cdoes not at all show a reverse of the growth of electric cars. It shows an extremely robust increase of global electric car sales,\u201d he told reporters Tuesday. The growth is not driven just by Chinese buyers. The number of new battery electric cars sold in the European Union rose almost 4% in the first quarter of this year compared with the same period in 2023, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 Association. In a statement, Birol said: \u201cRather than tapering off, the global EV revolution appears to be gearing up for a new phase of growth.\u201d Despite the upbeat trends, EV makers are grappling with slim profit margins, squeezed by price wars as competition heats. In the past few days, Tesla and Chinese EV maker Li Auto have cut prices on major models in China, the world\u2019s biggest EV market, with Tesla also cutting prices in Germany and the United States. Earlier this month, Tesla posted its first annual drop in sales in nearly four years. The company\u2019s stock has plunged more than 40% so far this year. China\u2019s BYD has also stumbled after it briefly surpassed Tesla as global market leader, with its sales falling to about 300,000 in the first quarter from more than 525,000 in the final three months of 2023. Automakers may be hurting from the price cuts but they will be crucial to increasing the take-up of EVs around the world, according to the IEA, which emphasized that the \u201cpace of the transition to EVs\u2026 will hinge on affordability.\u201d In China, more than 60% of EVs sold last year were less expensive than conventional cars, but in Europe and the United States the purchase price for new cars with internal combustion engines remains lower on average. \u201cIntensifying market competition and improving battery technologies are expected to reduce (EV) prices in the coming years,\u201d the IEA said. \u201cGrowing electric car exports from Chinese automakers, which accounted for more than half of all electric car sales in 2023, could add to downward pressure on purchase prices,\u201d it added. Last year, Chinese carmakers accounted for more than half of global electric car sales, compared with their 10% share of the conventional car market. \u201cChina is the de facto leader of electric car manufacturing around the world,\u201d Birol said. Concerns about soaring imports of Chinese EVs prompted the European Union to open an investigation late last year into China\u2019s state support for EV makers. The auto industry is a major employer in Europe and crucial to the region\u2019s biggest economy, Germany, which is home to Volkswagen, Audi and BMW. EV sales in China will account for almost 60% of the global total this year and about 45% of all car sales in the country. By 2030, almost one in three cars on the roads in China is set to be electric, up from fewer than one in 10 last year, according to the IEA. That compares with its forecast for 17% in the United States and 18% in the European Union, compared with just over 2% and almost 4% respectively last year. \u201cThis shift will have major ramifications for both the auto industry and the energy sector,\u201d Birol said. The IEA sees global oil demand peaking in 2030, helped by the electrification of the transport sector. In addition to affordability, another barrier to mass adoption of electric cars is a lack of public charging infrastructure in Europe and the United States. Under current government policies, the number of public EV charging points worldwide is expected to reach 15 million by the end of the decade, a near-fourfold increase from last year, according to the IEA.

However, it\u2019s clear that there is something different about Dex; she\u2019s an entirely virtual \u201cdigital human,\u201d designed by a startup in the UK. For her performances, Dex is displayed on a video screen or as a holographic projection, with her mixes created by humans. She is animated using Unreal Engine \u2014 a 3D modeling software widely used in video games \u2014 combined with motion-capture. Generative artificial intelligence allows her to remember information and respond to questions, using a voice also generated by AI. \u201cShe\u2019s probably one of the only digital humans in the performance space that you can have a conversation and interact with,\u201d says Denise Harris, CCO of startup Sum Vivas. \u201cYou can ask her anything. She is a genius about music.\u201d Last month, Dex performed at Digital Fashion Weeks in New York, Paris and Milan, and she has modeled outfits by Prada and Louis Vuitton at digital fashion events.

According to CEO and founder Rob Sims, digital humans can help bridge the gap between AI technology and people. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve found is when people start working with and conversing with a digital human, they very quickly suspend disbelief,\u201d Sims tells CNN. \u201cIt becomes natural.\u201d AI explosion Since OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT was launched in November 2022, considerable hype has surrounded the potential of generative AI \u2014 artificial intelligence powered by huge datasets of information, capable of generating text outputs in a conversational way. Record levels of investment into generative AI have followed, with over $21 billion poured into the industry during the first nine months of last year, according to data insights company Pitchbook. In March 2023, Google launched Bard (recently renamed Gemini) and around the same time Anthropic released its AI assistant Claude. As generative AI chatbots become increasingly ubiquitous, Sum Vivas is one of several companies looking to make them more human. US and New Zealand-based UneeQ has developed animated conversational \u201cdigital humans\u201d that can be used as virtual sales reps and customer service agents on company websites, and this month it debuted Sama 2.0, an animated cabin crew member that answers questions on Qatar Airways\u2019 website and app. Microsoft recently announced that users of its Azure software would be able to create lifelike avatars capable of turning text prompts into animated speech. However, there are widespread concerns about the impact AI could have on the job market.  \u201cWhen we rely on automated tools, what skills are we losing in the process?\u201d asks Jennifer Ding, senior researcher at the Alan Turing Institute, the UK\u2019s national institute for data science and artificial intelligence. \u201cIn some ways, we think of AI as something that\u2019s helping us or augmenting our work,\u201d she says. \u201cHowever, alongside, this fear of replacement is bubbling up more and more.\u201d Harris, however, points to new opportunities within digital human design and development. \u201cEvery scenario that we found, we\u2019re creating jobs and working in harmony with people rather than taking away jobs,\u201d she says. \u201cDigital humans, first and foremost, should work with other human colleagues,\u201d adds Sims. \u201cWe\u2019ll move into a stage where digital humans will start to become just another member of the team, with added benefits for that team, and obviously the customers they serve.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/business/digital-humans-ai-dj-dex-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_07_08_success_money-problems-dementia", "text": "Financial files in disarray. Late payments and last-warning service-cutoff notices. Multiple daily bank withdrawals. Out-of-character purchases. When a family member who has been fairly responsible with money all their lives becomes careless with their finances, it may be one sign of as-yet-undiagnosed dementia. Researchers at the New York Federal Reserve who analyzed both US credit reporting and Medicare data found that in the five years before a dementia diagnosis, a person\u2019s average credit scores may start to weaken and their\u00a0payment delinquencies rise. \u201cThe harmful financial effects of undiagnosed memory disorders exacerbate the already substantial financial pressure households face upon diagnosis,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cBeyond susceptibility to payment delinquency, early stage [Alzheimer\u2019s disease and related disorders] may affect new account openings and debt accumulation, credit utilization, and/or credit mix.\u201d Their findings echo the results of a 2020 study from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. \u2018Methodical\u2019 military spouse\u2019s record-keeping deteriorates Marcey Tidwell, who lives in Bloomington, Indiana, said those findings are \u201cnot remotely shocking.\u201d Tidwell\u2019s mother was diagnosed with a form of dementia in 2020 and has been living with her daughter ever since. Tidwell said that for most of her life, her mother was an \u201coutrageously methodical human being\u201d who kept the bills paid and the family records organized across many moves as her husband pursued a career in the military. After going through her mother\u2019s papers this year, Tidwell surmises that her mother\u2019s memory started faltering around 2015, because from that point forward her record-keeping became \u201cless than pristine.\u201d For example, Tidwell said, her mom used to keep an immaculate record of checks written and deposits and withdrawals made in her checkbook register. But that register became a mess. \u201cThere was a bunch of stuff scratched out and she was obsessively adding and re-adding \u2014 she knew things weren\u2019t all they could be. Later on, I saw that she took out large amounts of her savings, more than she needed for groceries.\u201d Former finance executive accrues piles of unpaid bills, finances new car he didn\u2019t need Karen Lemay, who lives in Ottawa, Canada, knew something was really wrong with her father in 2022 when she saw on his desk piles of late-payment notices and final-notification warnings from service providers and insurers. Her father was a former finance executive who \u201cwas very conservative with his money, very smart about it and never reckless with it,\u201d she said. And he had strongly impressed upon his daughter the importance of paying off her credit card in full every month to avoid interest. Yet Lemay discovered he owed $50,000 in charges, interest and late payment fees on a Visa card. He also financed the purchase of a new car he didn\u2019t need, just months before police took away his driver\u2019s license. Normally, he would only buy high-end used cars with cash, she said. What\u2019s more, his daughter noted, he failed to pay his 2021 taxes. So he ended up owing the government roughly $20,000, the bulk of which was for late payment and underpayment penalties. \u201cI spoke to him about some of his balances and he refused to believe he hadn\u2019t paid them,\u201d Lemay said. Two parents with dementia, one daughter\u2019s efforts to reduce financial worry Jayne Sibley, who lives in the United Kingdom, knows the pain and stress of dealing with the financial behaviors that can signal dementia. Her father and mother were both diagnosed with different forms of it. Her father moved into a nursing home years ago, but her now-deceased mother remained in her own home, albeit with live-in care. \u201cThe most challenging thing we faced was managing mum\u2019s everyday money as her condition progressed. She would overspend on things she didn\u2019t need or want. Random items, cleaning equipment, luxury food. She also fell victim to scams over the phone \u2014 a fake insurance policy, those sorts of things,\u201d Sibley said. Her mother also would take money out of the cash machine two to three times a day and give it to anyone who asked. Acutely aware of how high long-term care costs were, given her father\u2019s situation, Sibley said she worried that her mother would run through the money that would be needed for her own care. While her mother\u2019s condition made her vulnerable with money, she initially was still able to walk and shop and go to yoga on her own. In other words, she was able to maintain a lot of her autonomy and social ties. To try to stem the money outflow, Sibley and her brother tried doling out a week\u2019s worth of cash for their mother \u201cbut she\u2019d spend it all in one go,\u201d she said. Ditto when they tried divvying the cash up into daily envelopes. Eventually, they took away her cash card. But, soon after, her condition worsened, Sibley said. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t able to maintain her familiar routines and social connections. That\u2019s when we realized there has to be a better way.\u201d With her husband, she founded Sibstar, which offers a debit card in the UK that can be used by a person with dementia to maintain some sense of financial autonomy and social engagement. When needed, family caregivers can monitor their debit transactions via an app. As a person\u2019s condition worsens, the caregiver can set limits on how much money can be spent on any given day or week, and where the card can be used (eg, at cash machines, online or at the grocery store). Early planning lessens some stress While there are few dementia-specific financial tools to reduce the odds that someone squanders their own hard-earned money, there are steps you can take to make it easier to assume control over another person\u2019s finances when they become incapacitated. In 2008, a year after her father died without a will and a dozen years before her mother was diagnosed with dementia, Tidwell said she and her siblings took their mother to a lawyer to make sure she had a will, named her medical proxy and named the person to whom she would give power of attorney to handle her financial affairs should the need arise. That made it easier for Tidwell, among other things, to get online access in 2018 to her mother\u2019s bank account to make sure nothing was amiss. By 2020, she had automated her mother\u2019s bill paying online. \u201cThe time to make plans is before you need to. It\u2019s hard to overstate what a gift that trip to the lawyer in 2008 was to \u2018future me,\u2019\u201d said Tidwell, who fully manages her mother\u2019s finances now that her condition has worsened considerably. Since dementia can worsen over time and because someone in the initial stages may not recognize they are more vulnerable to financial errors and scams, the US National Institute on Aging recommends that a family take steps early on to alleviate those concerns, such as setting up automated bill payments for the person with dementia.

And one of those was to replace the plane that saw a door plug blow out mid-flight just over six months ago. It sold just three 737 Max jets, two to an unidentified customer and one to Alaska Airlines to replace the plane that had a door plug blow out on a January 5 flight as it approached 16,000 feet. The other 11 jets were 777 freighters. It marked one of its best sales months of the year, but it still ended the first half of 2024 with gross sales down 70% from a year ago. The 14 gross sales are up from the only four sold in May and seven in April. But it\u2019s down 95% from the 304 gross orders it took in in June of 2023. Boeing\u2019s sales have fallen sharply in the wake of the Alaska Air incident, as even airlines eager to expand their fleets hold off on purchases while Boeing works through a myriad of problems. It had come into the year with a record sales month in December, but sales ground to a virtual halt following the Alaska Air incident. The one strong sales month it reported was in March, when it sold 113 planes. Most of that came from an order of 85 jets from American Airlines. But that order was for a longer version of the 737 Max, which the Federal Aviation Administration has not even certified to carry passengers as of yet. That certification, originally expected this year, has been pushed back to at least 2025 by the problems brought to light by the Alaska Air incident. The company agreed Sunday to plead guilty to its employees defrauding the FAA during the original certification process for the 737 Max. It could face further criminal charges related to the Alaska Air incident. The plane it sold to Alaska Air is also a 737 Max 10 to replace the plane that lost the door plug in January. Boeing agreed to repurchase that specific plane, which was able to land without serious injury for crew or passenger. Boeing declined to say its plans for the plane now that it has taken it back.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/business/boeing-sales/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "business"}}

The US dollar has had a remarkably strong summer, and while its rise has eased in the days following a left-wing resurgence in France\u2019s elections, it\u2019s still on a gangbusters ride. The greenback is about 13% stronger (measured through the the Fed\u2019s advanced foreign economy dollar index) than it was in 2021, before the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates. That\u2019s great news for American tourists planning trips abroad this year (and they are, in record numbers), but not as good for the large, multi-national companies that make up the majority of the S&P 500. What\u2019s happening: The most recent bump in the dollar is politically charged, but, at its core, it all comes down to the Fed. After showing a dead heat for most of the year, recent presidential polling has shifted in favor of\u00a0former President Donald Trump over President Joe Biden. Should Trump\u2019s advantage now turn into a win in November, that would likely mean the preservation or expansion of tax cuts and increased tariffs. During last month\u2019s presidential debates, Trump reiterated his desire to impose a 10% tariff on all imports, which would likely increase inflation and cast doubt on interest rate cuts. \u201cAfter reflecting a statistical dead heat for most of the past few months, US presidential polling has broken decisively in favor of a Republican win, and markets that ignored political rhetoric are beginning to discount outcomes, with bond volatility spiking,\u201d wrote\u00a0 Lisa Shalett, head of the global investment office at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, in a note on Monday. \u201cWhile stocks have continued to grind higher, equity investors will ultimately need to deal with the potential consequences of proposed policies featuring three critical variables\u2014tax cuts, tariffs and closed borders,\u201d she said. Morgan Stanley research estimates that an expansion of the 2017 tax cuts would boost deficits sharply, sending the US dollar even higher. There are other reasons the dollar has been propelled higher as some European and Asian currencies have seen lackluster growth. The US economy has been relatively resilient through high inflation and interest rates while the eurozone slipped into recession and China and Japan suffered their own economic setbacks. Why it matters: \u201cThe US dollar has been amazingly strong since the US is expected to lead a worldwide economic recovery,\u201d said Louis Navellier, chairman and founder of Navellier & Associates. But that comes with potential repercussions. \u201cA strong US dollar can hinder multi-international companies like the big stocks that dominate the S&P 500, however, smaller, more domestic companies are poised to prosper.\u201d While expectations for second-quarter earnings, which begin in earnest on Friday, remain high, there may be some pessimism on calls about what a strong dollar could mean going forward, he said. A strong dollar makes US exports more expensive and reduces the profits of American companies operating overseas when earnings are converted back to dollars. It also increases competition from cheaper imports. And while a strong dollar lowers the cost of imported raw materials, it can boost inflation and hurt foreign investments.

Boeing agrees to plead guilty Boeing has agreed to plead guilty to one charge of conspiracy to defraud the United States\u00a0for its role in two fatal 737 Max crashes,\u00a0the Justice Department said in a court filing Sunday evening. It represents yet another black eye for the company after a series of embarrassing safety blunders, but the agreement avoids what could have been more serious consequences, reports CNN\u2019s Chris Isidore. It will pay up to $487 million in fines \u2014 a fraction of the $24.8 billion that families of crash victims wanted the aircraft maker to pay. The families of victims of\u00a0two fatal crashes\u00a0of the 737 Max oppose the deal, the department said. The guilty plea is a severe blow to the reputation of Boeing, a company once known for the quality and safety of its commercial planes. Beyond the fatal crashes of the 737 Max jets, the company has faced a series of questions about the safety and quality of its planes.\u00a0In January,\u00a0a door plug on a 737 Max flown by Alaska Airlines\u00a0blew out early in a flight, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the jet and further damaging Boeing\u2019s reputation. The agreement stipulates that Boeing will have to operate under the oversight of an independent monitor \u2013 a person to be chosen by the government \u2013 for a period of three years.

{"id": "2024_07_03_business_china-bond-market-bank-crisis-svb-intl-hnk", "text": "Money is rushing into Chinese government bonds, sending their prices soaring and yields plunging to record lows as investors hunt for a safer alternative to the country\u2019s ravaged real estate market and volatile stocks. The yield on China\u2019s onshore 10-year government bond, which is a benchmark for a wide range of interest rates, touched 2.18% Monday, the lowest since 2002 when records began. Yields on 20-year and 30-year bonds are also hovering around historic lows. Bond yields, or the returns offered to investors for holding them, fall as prices rise. Lower borrowing costs should be welcome in an economy struggling to recover from a property crash, sluggish consumer spending and weak business confidence. But the sharp move in bonds is sparking talk of a bubble and triggering acute anxiety among China\u2019s policymakers, who fear a crisis similar to the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) last year. The People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC) has issued over 10 separate warnings since April about the risk that a bond bubble could burst, destabilizing financial markets and derailing the Chinese economy\u2019s uneven recovery. Now it\u2019s doing something unprecedented \u2014borrowing bonds to sell them to tamp down prices. \u201cSVB in the United States has taught us that the central bank needs to observe and evaluate the situation of the financial market from a macro-prudential perspective,\u201d PBOC Governor Pan Gongsheng said at a financial forum in Shanghai late last month. \u201cAt present, we must pay close attention to the maturity mismatch and interest rate risks associated with the large holdings of medium and long-term bonds by some non-bank entities,\u201d the central bank governor added. Those entities include insurance companies, investment funds and other financial firms. Lessons from the US SVB was the biggest US bank failure since the global financial crisis. The roots of its demise lay in the fact that SVB had ploughed billions into US government bonds, an apparently safe bet that came unstuck when the Federal Reserve began hiking interest rates to tame inflation. Prices of the bonds SVB was holding fell, eroding its finances. Policymakers in China fear the risk of a similar crisis in the world\u2019s second largest economy if the bond frenzy goes unchecked. Prices of Chinese bonds have risen fast since early this year as investors pile into them because of the uncertain economic outlook. Businesses are also borrowing less, leaving banks with excess cash they have to park somewhere. \u201cCredit demand is weak due to the property woes. As a result, banks have to buy more bonds as money is trapped in the interbank market,\u201d said Larry Hu, chief China economist for Macquarie Group. A \u201cdeflationary outlook\u201d for the economy has also taken hold among investors, prompting them to flock to long-term sovereign bonds, he added. Similar to SVB, China\u2019s financial institutions have invested a significant amount in long-term government bonds, which make them vulnerable to sudden interest rate changes. Beijing is concerned that if the bond bubble pops, sending prices down and yields up, those lenders could suffer big losses. \u201cWhat worries policymakers is the interest rate risk, which will rise once the dominant narrative shifts from deflation to reflation,\u201d Hu from Macquarie said.  In the first half of this year, net purchases of sovereign bonds by financial institutions, mostly by regional banks, were 1.55 trillion yuan ($210 billion), up 61% from the same period last year, according to an analysis of central bank data by Zheshang Securities, a state-controlled brokerage firm. Official interest rates in China are low after cuts in recent years by the PBOC aimed at supporting the economy. Deflationary pressures have persisted \u2014 consumer prices rose less than expected in May and factory prices declined for the 20th month in a row. But \u201conce external demand slows, Beijing will have to step up stimulus to achieve its (economic) growth target,\u201d Hu said. If that happens, bond yields will rise as investors switch back into riskier stocks. Meanwhile, demand for credit should rise, banks will lend more and therefore reduce their holdings of government debt. This will cause the bond bull market to reverse, Hu said. The country\u2019s \u201c4,000 or so small and medium-sized banks\u201d will be particularly vulnerable to the interest rate risk, he added. Cooling the frenzy In a sign of growing concerns, the PBOC said Monday it would intervene directly in the bond market to cool the frenzy for \u201cthe first time in history,\u201d according to state media. The central bank will borrow government bonds from traders on the open market, so that it can sell them in a bid to depress prices and boost yields. The decision was made after \u201ccareful observation and assessment\u201d and was intended to \u201cmaintain the sound operation of the bond market,\u201d the PBOC added. Chinese state media outlets are also sounding the alarm. The state-owned Securities Times warned Tuesday about the risks of a bond market bubble, calling out the case of SVB and a Japanese bank whose holdings of US and European government debt have lost value as yields have risen. \u201cThe bubble formed by the rush of funds into the bond market is accumulating interest rate risks,\u201d the Securities Times said in an editorial. \u201cThe \u2018triggers\u2019 for the bankruptcy of SVB and the huge losses of Japan\u2019s Norinchukin\u00a0Bank were all interest rate risks caused by their over-reliance on bond investment.\u201d The repeated verbal warnings have so far failed to rein in soaring bond prices. Hence this week\u2019s market intervention. Monday\u2019s move \u201cdemonstrates the PBOC\u2019s determination\u201d to cool the rally by selling bonds and lifting yields, said Zhang Jiqiang, chief fixed-income analyst at Huatai Securities. \u201cThe central bank wants to avoid an SVB-style crisis,\u201d he said. Economic risks The rapid decline in Chinese bond yields also poses significant risks to the economy. \u201cLow government bond yields do more harm than good to the economy in the current circumstance,\u201d said Ken Cheung, director of foreign exchange strategy at Mizuho Securities in Hong Kong. That\u2019s because they could reinforce market expectations for aggressive interest rate cuts by the PBOC and weak growth, exacerbating the formation of \u201cdeflation mindset,\u201d he said. In addition, the bond market frenzy may counteract the PBOC\u2019s efforts to boost economic activity and increase money supply, as it encourages capital to flow into the bond market,\u00a0rather than going to riskier assets such as stocks, property, and other investments that drive economic growth. The decline in Chinese government bond yields could also widen the interest rate spread between the US and China, causing money to flee the world\u2019s second largest economy and heaping pressure on the yuan. \u201cChina\u2019s capital outflows in April reached the highest level since Jan 2016, largely due to the widening US-China yield gap,\u201d Hu said. \u201cTherefore, the PBOC doesn\u2019t want to see interest rates fall too quickly.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/business/china-bond-market-bank-crisis-svb-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_03_tech_google-ai-greenhouse-gas-emissions-environmental-impact", "text": "As Google has rushed to incorporate artificial intelligence into its core products \u2014 with sometimes less-than-stellar results \u2014 a problem has been brewing behind the scenes: the systems needed to power its AI tools have vastly increased the company\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. AI systems need lots of computers to make them work. The data centers needed to run them, essentially warehouses full of powerful computing equipment, suck up tons of energy to process data and manage the heat all of those computers produce. The end result has been that Google\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions have soared 48% since 2019, according to the tech giant\u2019s annual environment report. The tech giant blamed that growth mainly on \u201cincreased data center energy consumption and supply chain emissions.\u201d Now, Google is calling its goal to reach net-zero emissions by 2030 \u201cextremely ambitious,\u201d and said the pledge is likely to be affected by \u201cthe uncertainty around the future environmental impact of AI, which is complex and difficult to predict.\u201d In other words: a sustainability push by the company \u2014 which once included the slogan \u201cdon\u2019t be evil\u201d in its code of conduct \u2014 has gotten more complicated thanks to AI. Google, like other tech rivals, has gone all-in on investing in AI, which is widely seen as the next major tech revolution that\u2019s poised to change how we live, work and consume information. The company has integrated its Gemini generative AI technology into some of its core products, including Search and Google Assistant, and CEO Sundar Pichai has called Google an \u201cAI-first company.\u201d But AI comes with a major downside: the power-hungry data centers that Google and other Big Tech rivals are currently spending tens of billions of dollars each quarter to expand in order to fuel their AI ambitions. Illustrating just how much more demanding AI models are than traditional computing systems, the International Energy Agency estimates that a Google search query requires 0.3 watt-hours of electricity on average, while a ChatGPT request typically consumes about 2.9 watt-hours. An October\u00a0study\u00a0from Dutch researcher Alex de Vries estimated that the \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d suggests Google\u2019s AI systems could eventually consume as much electricity as the country of Ireland each year, assuming a full-scale adoption of AI in their current hardware and software. \u201cAs we further integrate AI into our products, reducing emissions may be challenging due to increasing energy demands from the greater intensity of AI compute, and the emissions associated with the expected increases in our technical infrastructure investment,\u201d Google said in its report, published Monday. It added that data center electricity consumption is currently growing faster than it can bring carbon-free electricity sources online. Google said it expects its total greenhouse gas emissions to continue to rise before falling, as the company seeks to invest in clean energy sources, such as wind and geothermal energy, to power its data centers. The large amounts of water used as coolant needed to prevent data centers from overheating also presents a sustainability challenge. Google says it aims to replenish 120% of the freshwater it consumes in its offices and data centers by 2030; last year, it replenished just 18% of that water, although the amount was up sharply from 6% the year prior. Google is also among companies experimenting with ways to use AI to fight climate change. A 2019 Google DeepMind project, for example, trained an AI model on weather forecasts and historical wind turbine data to predict the availability of wind power, helping to increase the value of the renewable energy source for wind farmers. The company has also used AI to suggest more fuel-efficient routes to drivers using Google Maps. \u201cWe know that scaling AI and using it to accelerate climate action is just as crucial as addressing the environmental impact associated with it,\u201d Google said in the report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/tech/google-ai-greenhouse-gas-emissions-environmental-impact/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "business"}}

In a letter by Michael Bloomberg in the Bloomberg Philanthropies\u2019 annual report, the billionaire said the donation addresses twin challenges: declining health and declining education. Johns Hopkins said Monday that for most medical school students, the gift will cover the full cost of attendance, including tuition and living expenses. Students from families earning less than $300,000 will be eligible for the gift. Living expenses will be covered for students who come from families that earn less than $175,000. It\u2019s not the first medical school to receive such a gift. In February, students at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York received free tuition after a $1 billion dollar donation from a former faculty member, Dr. Ruth Gottesman. In 2018, NYU\u2019s School of Medicine became the\u00a0first top 10 medical school in the country\u00a0to offer free tuition to accepted students. In the letter, Bloomberg, a Johns Hopkins alumnus, said life expectancy in the US is still lagging behind other countries since the Covid-19 pandemic. The pandemic also hurt public education, Bloomberg said, noting that \u201cremote schooling was a disaster for students.\u201d The high cost of medical school deters students from lower-income families from applying, the former New York City mayor said. He added that confronting this \u201chealth crisis\u201d should unite both political parties. An\u00a0October survey\u00a0from the Association of American Medical Colleges found that 70% of medical students who graduated in 2023 have taken on some level of education debt. The average graduate left medical school owing more than $200,000, according to the AAMC. \u201cMany who do matriculate end up dropping out because of financial pressures. And those who graduate often choose to work in the most lucrative specialties in order to repay their debts, rather than in fields and communities that are most in need,\u201d Bloomberg said, adding there are too few primary care doctors in the US.

Late last year, Meta (META)\u00a0launched\u00a0a service called \u201cSubscription for no ads,\u201d allowing European users of Facebook and Instagram to pay up to \u20ac12.99 ($14) a month for ad-free versions. The alternative is to accept versions with personalized ads. The European Commission said in a statement Monday that, in its preliminary view, \u201cthis binary choice forces users to consent to the (use) of their personal data and fails to provide them a less personalized but equivalent version of Meta\u2019s social networks.\u201d If the provisional findings of the Commission\u2019s investigation are confirmed, the EU could hit Meta with a fine equivalent to 10% of its global annual revenue under its landmark Digital Markets Act. Based on the company\u2019s 2023 results, that would amount to $13.5 billion. Meta said it didn\u2019t accept the Commission\u2019s findings. \u201c\u2019Subscription for no ads\u2019 follows the direction of the highest court in Europe and complies with the DMA,\u201d a spokesperson told CNN. \u201cWe look forward to further constructive dialogue with the European Commission to bring this investigation to a close.\u201d The EU announcement comes a week after the Commission accused Apple (AAPL) of breaching the DMA by preventing app developers from freely directing consumers to cheaper services. The regulators are also investigating Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) under the new law. The DMA, which came into force in March, requires dominant online platforms \u2014 so-called gatekeepers \u2014 to give users more choice, and rivals more opportunities to compete. Online platforms often collect personal data across their own and third-party services and use it in digital advertising services. Margrethe Vestager, a European Commissioner in charge of competition policy, noted in Monday\u2019s statement that Meta had been accumulating personal data of \u201cmillions of EU citizens over many years.\u201d \u201cWe want to empower citizens to be able to take control over their own data and choose a less personalized ads experience,\u201d she said. Michael Koenig, a senior official at the Commission, said Meta must offer users an alternative to \u201cfull\u201d ad personalization that \u201cdoes not rely on this personal data and which is then automatically less personalized and still available to them.\u201d \u201cThen Meta is free to keep a third option, which is a subscription not to see ads at all, or a fourth option which may have some premium features,\u201d he told journalists.

{"id": "2024_07_09_business_fed-chair-powell-talks-up-progress-on-inflation-but-says-rate-cuts-not-imminent-yet", "text": "Inflation has come a long way since reaching a four-decade peak two years ago, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday. However, central bank officials still want to see more progress before cutting interest rates, he noted, though they are also keeping a close eye on the job market. \u201cWe do not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range for the federal funds rate until we have gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%,\u201d Powell said in prepared testimony submitted to congressional lawmakers. During the hearing, Powell didn\u2019t specify that cutting this year remains likely, or give any hint about the timing of the first rate cut, which is a departure from previous comments he\u2019s made. \u201cThe most recent inflation readings, however, have shown some modest further progress, and more good data would strengthen our confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%,\u201d he added. Powell appeared Tuesday before the Senate Banking Committee to deliver his semiannual monetary policy report to Congress. He heads to the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday to address the same report on the state of the US economy. The Fed\u2019s key interest rate, which influences borrowing costs across the economy, has been at a 23-year high for about a year now, after the central bank aggressively lifted rates to bring down inflation. While the pace of price hikes slowed dramatically in 2023, it hit a snag early this year, which pushed back the timing of the first anticipated rate cut. Fed officials expect to cut interest rates just once this year, according to their latest economic projections in June, compared to the three cuts they forecast in March. Inflation resumed a downward trend in the spring, but officials appear to be in lockstep saying they need more evidence that inflation is truly headed toward their 2% goal. In June, consumer prices didn\u2019t rise on a monthly basis for the first time since November, according to the Fed\u2019s favorite inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index. The annual PCE inflation rate registered at 2.6% in June, down slightly from 2.7% in May. \u201cInflation is now around 2-and-a-half percent, so we have seen significant progress in bringing it down,\u201d New York Fed President John Williams said last week at an event in India. \u201cBut we still have a way to go to reach our 2% target on a sustained basis.\u201d But inflation isn\u2019t the only thing the Fed is watching as it mulls when to begin cutting interest rates. The Fed is watching America\u2019s long-robust job market closely after it has shown signs of cooling. That comes as US consumers show signs of pulling back after years of elevated inflation and a sharp rise in interest rates, according to the latest spending data and remarks from retailers. Here are key takeaways from Powell\u2019s hearing before the Senate Banking Committee. Powell says the labor market is back to normal \u2014 but there are still risks The Fed\u2019s top leader told senators that America\u2019s job market now looks similar to the way it did before the Covid-19 pandemic: \u201cstrong, but not overheated.\u201d The US job market rebounded mightily after a brief, pandemic-induced recession in 2020, and it has continued to expand ever since. But it has loosened a little recently: The unemployment rate last month crept up to its highest level in more than two years, and new applications for unemployment benefits have trended up in recent weeks. \u201cI\u2019m concerned that if the Fed waits too long to lower rates, the Fed could undo the progress we\u2019ve made in creating good-paying jobs,\u201d\u00a0Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, who chairs the Senate Banking Committee, said during the hearing. The US job market is still a pillar of strength for the broader economy but it\u2019s not running at the same red-hot pace of a few years ago. The unemployment rate edged higher, to 4.1%, in June, the highest rate since November 2021, though employers have continued to hire at a brisk pace. The gap between job openings and the number of unemployed people seeking work, a measure of how tight the labor market is, has narrowed markedly over the past year. Powell expressed throughout the hearing that the Fed is fully aware that it is dealing with \u201ctwo-sided risks\u201d \u2014 one is of inflation heating back up because the central bank cut rates too soon, and the other is of the labor market weakening sharply because the Fed waited too long to cut rates. Both risks would result in consequences for Americans and the overall US economy. The Fed is tasked by Congress to both stabilize prices and maximize employment, and it balances its focus on either goal depending on the economic circumstances at the time. For a few years, the Fed has focused more on its inflation side of its dual mandate, but that has shifted recently. \u201cIf we see that the labor market were weakening unexpectedly, which is to say more than what we\u2019ve seen in a material way unexpectedly,\u201d Powell said, \u201cthen we could also respond to that, because we have a dual mandate and we now see the two mandates more in balance than they were a year ago.\u201d America\u2019s economic engine, consumer spending, has started to show some cracks. Sales at US retailers have consistently come in weaker than expected for the past few months and retailers have sounded the alarm on shoppers across the income spectrum trading down for cheaper alternatives. Recent surveys of service-providing businesses in the United States have shown that consumer demand so far this summer has been tepid, a stark contrast to last year when Americans splurged. Put together, the recent spate of economic data help build a case for the Fed to begin lowering borrowing costs. Senators talk financial regulation The Fed chief told lawmakers that a proposed set of banking regulations will likely be revised and re-proposed \u2014 a topic Republicans repeatedly brought up with Powell. Meanwhile, some Democrats talked about rules over compensation for Wall Street executives. The Fed is one of the country\u2019s key banking regulators, in addition to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. In the aftermath of the Great Recession, banking authorities around the world convened in Basel, Switzerland, to develop global standards for banks to fortify financial stability. Those rules are still in the process of being adopted and implemented. The final phase of these banking rules is known as Basel III Endgame, and it calls on raising the amount of capital that the largest banks hold to protect themselves against risks. The Fed\u2019s latest so-called \u201cstress test,\u201d which is a simulation of how major banks would fare in tough economic conditions, showed that all 31 banks tested would survive and still be able to lend credit. But they took a bigger financial hit\u00a0than last year. When the Basel III Endgame was proposed last year, bank interest groups\u00a0and lawmakers from both sides of the aisle\u00a0pushed back, saying that banks needing to beef up capital\u00a0beyond what\u2019s currently required\u00a0would undermine their ability to lend. Powell said Tuesday a \u201cstrongly held view of the members of the board is that we do need to put a revised proposal out for comment for some period.\u201d It\u2019s unclear what changes a new proposal would specifically have. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts grilled Powell over a long-delayed rule that aims to restrain reckless behavior on Wall Street tied to incentive-based pay for executives, known as Section 956 of the Dodd\u2013Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act passed in 2010. Several regulators, including the Fed, need to figure out how to implement the rule first, but reaching a consensus among them is typically a challenge, especially considering intense lobbying efforts. \u201cThe Fed has refused to join the other financial regulators in finalizing a rule implementing Section 956 as Congress directed,\u201d Warren said. She pointed to a comment that Powell made in the past that he wants to see evidence of the problem that Section 956 would solve. Powell said that he \u201cnever said trust the banks to regulate themselves.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/business/fed-chair-powell-talks-up-progress-on-inflation-but-says-rate-cuts-not-imminent-yet/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_09_business_airbnb-hidden-camera-invs", "text": "It was another lawsuit brought by another victim whose fun-filled vacation turned into a voyeuristic nightmare: A woman was secretly recorded undressing at a rental property, her images stored on the computer of an alleged sexual predator accused of spying on unsuspecting renters for years. Airbnb, one of the world\u2019s largest short-term rental companies, had seen this sort of scenario before. Typically, the company seeks to settle hidden camera cases quickly and confidentially. But this one played out differently. An Airbnb representative testifying at a court-ordered deposition early last year offered a rare glimpse of the company\u2019s hidden camera problem: Airbnb has generated tens of thousands of customer support tickets related to surveillance devices in the last decade. During the hours-long deposition, the Airbnb employee also revealed that when a guest complains of a hidden camera, the company doesn\u2019t \u2013 as a matter of practice \u2013 notify law enforcement, not even when a child is involved. The company may, however, reach out to hosts about complaints as part of internal inquiries \u2013 a move law enforcement experts say could hinder criminal investigations because it gives suspects time to destroy evidence. A CNN investigation found that Airbnb consistently fails to protect its guests despite knowing hidden cameras are a persistent concern within its industry. Airbnb\u2019s corporate strategies, moreover, have been aimed at preventing regulation of the short-term rental market to allow the company to distance itself from responsibility for guest safety and privacy. Thousands of images have been recovered from short-term rental hosts by law enforcement. Hidden cameras placed in bedrooms and bathrooms show guests during their most private moments \u2013 changing clothes, being with their children, even having sex, according to CNN\u2019s review of court and police records, as well as interviews with nearly two dozen guests who found surveillance devices at short-term rental properties or were told by police they had been secretly recorded. Victims say they live under a shadow of fear that those private moments will become internet fodder. \u201cThis is not my Social Security number or my email address. This is my naked body,\u201d said one woman whose host secretly recorded her having sex with her husband at a cottage in Texas. Airbnb declined CNN\u2019s request for an interview. However, in a written statement, a spokesperson said that hidden camera complaints are rare, but when they do occur \u201cwe take appropriate, swift action, which can include removing hosts and listings that violate the policy.\u201d The spokesperson added that \u201cAirbnb\u2019s trust and safety policies lead the vacation rental industry and include background checks on US-based hosts and guests.\u201d CNN found that some of the policies touted by Airbnb come with significant disclaimers. The company\u2019s website, for example, tells users they should not rely on its background checks to identify \u201call past criminal convictions or sex offender registrations \u2026 or other red flags.\u201d And even if Airbnb discovers a user has a criminal background, convictions of \u201cmurder, terrorism, rape or child molestation\u201d are not automatic disqualifiers under the company\u2019s policy. \u2018The Wild West\u2019 Brian Chesky was unemployed when he and his roommate came up with the idea for Airbnb in 2007 while struggling to make rent in San Francisco. For $80 a night, they opened their home to three travelers, offering them air mattresses, breakfast and Wi-Fi. They called their start-up Air Bed and Breakfast. Thirteen years later, the company went public in the largest IPO of 2020, with a valuation of $47 billion. Today, Airbnb \u2013 which is valued higher than Hyatt Hotels Corporation and Marriott International combined \u2013 continues to chase the benefits of being an international hotel chain while shouldering few of the costs or responsibilities. Unlike hotels, Airbnb doesn\u2019t control the properties it advertises or employ on-site staff such as security guards, receptionists or cleaning professionals. Instead, it leaves the costs of maintaining and protecting short-term rentals to hosts. And, while hotels can be held legally responsible for guests harmed on their property, Airbnb frequently is not. In fact, Airbnb has fought against such liability in court, arguing it has little control over what happens at its listings \u2013 despite collecting roughly 17% of each booking. The multi-billion-dollar short-term rental industry paints a rosy picture with advertisements highlighting how home sharing improves human connection and offers intimate, private spaces for busy travelers. Still, violent crime and prostitution, as well as traveler deaths, have repeatedly forced Airbnb and its competitors into the international spotlight. One security concern, which has gone largely unchecked by Airbnb and the rest of the short-term rental market, is hidden cameras. Airbnb has known about the problem for at least a decade and has repeatedly notified its shareholders of the issue in annual reports since the company went public. \u201cWe were aware of it, there were an abundance of cases coming in,\u201d said one former Airbnb employee who asked to remain anonymous due to a non-disclosure agreement with the company. The employee, whose team dealt with safety and privacy issues, said hidden cameras were among the group\u2019s top concerns. Despite those concerns, the company for years allowed video surveillance by hosts in common areas, if the cameras were disclosed to guests. Chloe LeBrument, who traveled to London, Ontario, last summer with her fianc\u00e9 for a music festival, found a camera hidden in a charger in the bedroom at an Airbnb rental. \u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019s many, many people that have left the room having no idea that \u2026 they had been recorded,\u201d said LeBrument, whose host has been criminally charged with voyeurism. LeBrument described feeling angry and disappointed by the experience. \u201cIt felt really gross,\u201d she said. In January, CNN began reaching out to former Airbnb employees to ask about hidden camera concerns within the industry. In early March, Saturday Night Live mocked how ubiquitous the issue is in a skit. Just over a week later, the company announced it would ban all indoor cameras as of April 30. The company said nothing about how it would force hosts to comply with the rules. \u201cYou can have all these great rules, but if no one\u2019s checking that the rules are being followed \u2026 it\u2019s still kind of the Wild West,\u201d said attorney Bianca Zuniga-Goldwater, who represents several hidden camera victims in suits against Airbnb and Vrbo. CNN reviewed more than a dozen police investigations and lawsuits across the US involving at least 75 victims and found Airbnb often moves swiftly to contain user complaints and resolve them out of court. One attorney told CNN that Airbnb settled during a phone call after she gave them a heads up that she was going to file a lawsuit on behalf of a guest who said they found a camera hidden in their room at an Airbnb rental. Airbnb seeks to compel complainants into arbitration, a process that hides cases from public view, according to six attorneys who represented clients in cases against the short-term rental platform. When a settlement is reached, Airbnb has required users to sign confidentiality agreements, which bar them from discussing details of the deal. Airbnb told CNN its use of arbitration and non-disclosure agreements are standard practices within the industry. One man, who was recorded having sex with his wife at an Airbnb rental and received a financial settlement from the company, said he felt \u201cdirty\u201d signing a confidentiality agreement. \u201cWe were gagged,\u201d he said. Last year\u2019s court-ordered deposition, which was part of an ongoing case against Airbnb and has not previously been reported, should have detailed the scope of the company\u2019s hidden camera problem. The company, through its representative, was supposed to comply with a court order to quantify how many complaints or reports had been made to Airbnb by people who had been recorded by surveillance devices since December 1, 2013. The Airbnb representative came to the table with a number. Her testimony revealed the company generated 35,000 customer support tickets about surveillance devices in the preceding decade. In the deposition, the Airbnb representative sought to downplay the significance of the number of tickets, testifying they could reflect instances such as a malfunctioning doorbell camera or a tablet with recording capabilities left out on a coffee table. The representative did not provide any statistics detailing the number of claims she suggested were innocuous among the 35,000 tickets. The Airbnb spokesperson told CNN that a single report could create multiple tickets. The company declined to specify how many unique complaints there have been. CNN reached out to more than 130 former employees who handled safety issues or fielded security concerns for Airbnb\u2019s support line. Of the 24 who responded, nearly half said they couldn\u2019t speak about their experience due to non-disclosure agreements with the company. The few who agreed to be interviewed said one of the most common concerns they heard came from guests who feared they were being surreptitiously recorded. \u201cI\u2019ve never received a call about a doorbell,\u201d one former employee said. \u2018The scariest moment of my life\u2019 in Comfort, Texas David Wyzynajtys and his girlfriend had never used Airbnb before booking a romantic weekend away in July 2021. When the couple spotted a remote property in Texas Hill Country with numerous positive reviews and a host who had earned Airbnb\u2019s coveted \u201csuperhost\u201d status, they booked it. But after the pair arrived at the cottage in Comfort, Texas, and changed for the night, Wyzynajtys noticed something that terrified him: a hidden camera plugged into the wall and pointed directly at the bed. \u201cThe scariest moment of my life,\u201d Wyzynajtys recalled. Wyzynajtys and his partner frantically left the property and drove nearly 10 miles down a dark, winding road to check into a hotel. Rattled, they reached out to Airbnb via a customer support chat feature asking that someone call them. No one did. Instead, the couple received an in-app chat message from Airbnb later that night. According to court records, an Airbnb representative sought permission to report their complaint to the host, a man named A. Jay Allee. \u201cDo you mind if we contact the host and get his side of the story?\u201d\u00a0Wyzynajtys recalled the Airbnb representative asking in the message. The couple was fearful of Allee \u2013 they worried he could have been watching them through a livestream as they discovered the device and hurried to leave. Wanting to avoid a confrontation, Wyzynajtys denied Airbnb\u2019s request. Wyzynajtys said Airbnb was \u201ctotally just negligent or didn\u2019t care about it at all.\u201d The next day, Wyzynajtys contacted law enforcement. Police obtained a search warrant and raided Allee\u2019s property, confiscating cell phones, computers, and the camera, which Allee had been using to record guests for much of a year. Among the more than 2,000 recovered images, law enforcement identified more than 30 victims, including several children. Many guests \u2013 who booked the same property either through Airbnb or Vrbo \u2013 were captured in various stages of undress. Some were recorded having sex. Allee was later charged with 15 counts of invasive visual recording and pleaded guilty to six of them. Thirteen people who stayed at Allee\u2019s cottage \u2013 including two minors \u2013 sued Airbnb in California state court in July 2022. Airbnb settled with the plaintiffs six months later. A suit against Vrbo, filed by three couples who stayed at Allee\u2019s property and were all recorded being intimate with their partners, is ongoing. Allee held Airbnb\u2019s superhost status. The rank, which is granted by the company\u2019s algorithm, provides higher visibility and earning potential, according to Airbnb\u2019s website. On Vrbo\u2019s platform, he was similarly designated as a \u201cpremier host.\u201d One of Allee\u2019s victims said that superhost status was one of the reasons he and his family had chosen the property for their weekend away. \u201cIt kind of infers that a lot of people have good experiences there,\u201d said the victim, who asked not to be named due to privacy concerns. Some victims who spoke to CNN left positive reviews for stays \u2013 thus feeding the algorithm for a host\u2019s elevated status \u2013 only to later learn from law enforcement they had been secretly recorded. \u201cThank you for sharing your beautiful ranch with us,\u201d one of Allee\u2019s victims, who was recorded having sex with his partner, wrote in a Vrbo review after their stay in 2020. \u201cWe had an amazing time for our anniversary. We enjoyed feeding the animals and sitting by the fire at night just enjoying the silence. We will stay here again!\u201d A Vrbo spokesperson noted the company prohibits any cameras that capture the inside of a property and that \u201ctrust and safety are part of Vrbo\u2019s legacy.\u201d Vrbo didn\u2019t respond to questions about Allee or its policies. Lt. Butch Matjeka of the Kendall County Sheriff\u2019s Office notified Airbnb of his investigation into Allee in October 2021, police records show. Almost two months later \u2013 and five months after Wyzynajtys found the camera \u2013 Allee\u2019s listing remained active on Airbnb\u2019s site, according to a lawsuit against the company. \u201cFrom a law enforcement perspective, if I tell you that I\u2019m investigating then you should stop hosting that individual on your site until the outcome of my investigation,\u201d Matjeka said. Regulations are \u2018bad for business\u2019 Earlier this year, lawmakers in the European Union agreed to groundbreaking regulations governing the short-term rental industry. The new rules will require host registration, data sharing by the company and quality control of listings. Airbnb hailed the regulations as a \u201cwatershed moment\u201d for the industry and praised the EU-wide approach. Its public praise belies the fact that Airbnb has fought European cities for attempting to regulate the industry, said Kim van Sparrentak, a member of the European Parliament, who steered the legislation through the governing body. \u201cAirbnb is similar to other sharing economy companies \u2013 on a municipal level that means filing lawsuits as soon as any regulation is proposed,\u201d she said, referring to the company\u2019s strategy of fighting regulations in court. There are no similar federal regulations in the United States. Instead, local municipalities have been left to govern the fast-growing industry. In the cities that have been successful in introducing regulations \u2013 such as requiring hosts to register with local authorities \u2013 it has, at times, been difficult to get Airbnb to comply. Some of those regulations could assist with criminal investigations. When the city of New York enacted a law last year that requires hosts to register with the city and prohibits platforms from processing transactions for hosts that fail to comply, Airbnb responded by filing a lawsuit calling the measures \u201cextreme and oppressive\u201d and said the restrictions would cause the company \u201cirreparable harm.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s bad for business for them to follow regulations,\u201d said Murray Cox, who runs the nonprofit watchdog organization Inside Airbnb. Complying with rules, he said, often means excluding business from Airbnb\u2019s platform, which cuts into the company\u2019s bottom line. \u201cIt\u2019s about corporate greed.\u201d Airbnb\u2019s legal weapon of choice in its fight against regulations \u2013 and in at least one case against a guest who claimed she was injured while staying at an Airbnb rental \u2013 stems from a decades-old law known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. The law, often propped up as a defense by tech giants such as Facebook and X, states the platforms cannot be held responsible for user-posted content. But for Airbnb, the argument has not always been successful. The judge presiding over the New York case, for example, pointed out that this legal protection didn\u2019t apply to Airbnb because the company makes money on booking transactions. \u201cThey say that if you\u2019re going to participate in the transaction, then (Section 230) is off the table,\u201d said Cox. To Shannon Schott, a Florida-based attorney who settled with Airbnb after her client said he found a hidden camera at his rental, Airbnb\u2019s use of Section 230 should be concerning to users who value their privacy and safety. \u201cThey\u2019re not arguing: This didn\u2019t happen, your client isn\u2019t injured. They\u2019re arguing: We aren\u2019t responsible,\u201d Schott said. Illinois Rep. Jan Schakowsky, who has introduced legislation that aims to curb big technology companies\u2019 use of Section 230, argued that the platform would be safer if Airbnb were forced to take responsibility for what happens at its listings. Right now, Section 230 is used as a \u201cget out of jail free card,\u201d the Democratic lawmaker said. Broken promises Less than 20 miles from Airbnb\u2019s San Francisco headquarters, a 2019 Halloween party turned deadly at a rental property in California\u2019s wealthy Orinda community. People fled as shots rang out, and when the dust had  settled, five people were dead. The crime remains unsolved. The carnage prompted Airbnb to re-examine parts of its business model, cracking down on party homes and vowing to verify all listings and user identities. \u201cEvery home and every host on Airbnb will be reviewed with the objective of 100% verification\u201d by the end of 2020, Chesky, the company\u2019s CEO, promised after the shooting. In March, Airbnb disclosed only about 20% of its property listings worldwide had been verified. However, the company has boasted that every host, co-host and booking guest is identity-verified. That accomplishment comes with a big disclaimer: Its identity verification badge \u201cdoes not guarantee that someone is who they claim to be,\u201d the company\u2019s website states. Nor does Airbnb\u2019s identify verification process necessarily uncover a user\u2019s criminal history. Earlier this year, Airbnb guests in the outskirts of Melbourne, Australia, were shocked to learn their host, with whom they shared their rental home, was a registered sex offender. According to a local news report that reviewed the listing at the time, Airbnb had verified the identity of the host. However, the identification process didn\u2019t appear to surface the 11 charges of sexual assault on a mentally disabled person \u2013 for which the host spent more than four years in prison. Airbnb told the news outlet it suspended the host\u2019s account after it learned of the criminal conviction. Background checks appear to go beyond identity verification and involve searching public databases for users\u2019 information. The checks, which Airbnb says are conducted by a third party, could notify the company of users\u2019 criminal histories. However, the company makes no guarantees to perform them on every user worldwide. On its website, Airbnb says it may run a background check if it has at least a first name, last name and date of birth for US-based users who create listings. Still, the company warns travelers they shouldn\u2019t rely on its background checks to uncover all convictions, sex offender registrations or other red flags for its users. \u2018Digital content is forever\u2019 Allee was released from jail in February following a one-year sentence. His attorney didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. Police identified more than 30 suspected victims who stayed at Allee\u2019s cottage but could only file charges in connection with 15. To some of those victims, his brief stint behind bars didn\u2019t suit the crime. \u201cLess than a month for every victim,\u201d said Wyzynajtys, the guest who found Allee\u2019s hidden camera. However, Allee\u2019s lenient sentence was not unusual. In most states, and on the federal level, video voyeurism is a misdemeanor, punishable by no more than a year behind bars. In 2022, Airbnb superhost Peter Madden pleaded guilty to seven counts of violation of privacy in connection with recording five guests at his property in Maine, according to the Cumberland County District Attorney. During an interview with police, Madden initially denied ownership of the camera, which was concealed in a clock radio and pointed at his guests\u2019 bed. Then, he said he put it there for security reasons. Ultimately, Madden, whose attorney didn\u2019t respond to CNN\u2019s requests for comment, admitted he\u2019d been recording guests engaged in sexual activity. \u201cThere\u2019s stuff of a couple of couples playing around or getting changed,\u201d he conceded when pressed by an officer about what images the camera captured. \u201cAre you a voyeur?\u201d the officer asked, according to a recording obtained by CNN. In response, Madden laughed. \u201cI\u2019m an artist,\u201d he said. \u201cI look at everything, I study everything.\u201d Madden served 14 days behind bars. Victims, on the other hand, suffer lengthier consequences. All of Allee\u2019s victims who spoke with CNN, seven in total, said they suffered long-term trauma due to Allee\u2019s actions. They also detailed the crippling fear that their images \u2013 or those of their kids \u2013 will one day end up online, if they haven\u2019t already. \u201cWhat is made into digital content is forever,\u201d said the woman who was secretly recorded having sex with her husband at Allee\u2019s cottage. An intensive care nurse who visited Allee\u2019s property at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic continues to suffer from \u201csocial distress around the personal nature of the recordings and the possibility that they will become public,\u201d according to the lawsuit she filed against Vrbo. Several images on Allee\u2019s computer showed the nurse undressed and being intimate with her husband. Others captured her infant son, police records show. Vrbo didn\u2019t respond to CNN\u2019s inquiries about the case. One couple \u2013 who stayed there to celebrate an anniversary \u2013 said they felt \u201cshocked and appalled\u201d by the experience and worried that strangers had seen images of their private moments. One woman said she now takes medication to treat feelings of paranoia. \u201cIt\u2019s violating,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cWho knows where that footage went and who saw that?\u201d   Senior Investigative Correspondent: Kyung LahExecutive Producer: Patricia DiCarloManaging Editor: Matt LaitDeputy Managing Editor: Samira JafariVideo Producer: John GeneralSupervising Producer: Logan WhitesidePhoto Editor: Austin SteeleContributor: Yahya Abou-Ghazala", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/business/airbnb-hidden-camera-invs/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_01_tech_aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl", "text": "A London-based technology company is looking to \u201cdemocratize\u201d talent-identification and scouting in soccer using a mobile app. Free to download and available globally, the aiScout app allows aspiring soccer stars to enter virtual trials for professional clubs by uploading self-recorded footage of themselves completing a series of drills. It offers 75 exercises, designed to test a range of skills, with videos showing users how to complete them. Performances are automatically scored by artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The data can then be accessed by clubs, allowing their scouts to peruse scores for viable talent, honing their search with a variety of filters; from age and gender to position on the pitch. The app currently has two English Premier League (EPL) partners, Chelsea and Burnley, and clubs can tailor their in-app trials to meet specific needs and set their own benchmarks by having their academy players complete the same drills. \u201cWe\u2019re putting that data up front to make better use of [the scouts\u2019] time,\u201d said Richard Felton-Thomas, chief operating officer of ai.io, the company behind the app. \u201cTo say [to scouts], \u2018Go over to this place today because there\u2019s three players in that game that are all actually beating your Chelsea standard\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s going to be the best use of your time.\u2019\u201d It already appears to be working for some. Ben Greenwood had never had a trial with a professional club until he downloaded the app in 2019. After uploading footage of himself, the 17-year-old landed a trial with Chelsea, becoming the first user of the app to get a trial with a pro club. He signed a contract\u00a0with EPL team Bournemouth\u00a0in 2021. \u2018It\u2019s more about evolution\u2019 Having beta-tested in with players spanning 125 countries, Greenwood among them, 135 players have been trialed or signed by pro clubs or national teams through the app \u2014 which fully launched in September 2023 \u2014 according to Felton-Thomas. Just over 100,000 players make up the current database, but with over 100 clubs lined up to join Chelsea and Burnley, as well as a multi-year partnership with Major League Soccer in the US announced last May, Felton-Thomas projects user numbers to surge into the millions as the operation ramps up this year. Felton-Thomas said the \u201clion\u2019s share\u201d of its income comes from charging clubs a license fee to run the platform. Annual fees vary depending on the size of the club and the tools they require, ranging from six figures for \u201ctier one\u201d sides like Chelsea, to thousands of pounds for clubs lower down the footballing pyramid. The use of smart technology in sport continues to expand, including\u00a0AI commentary tools and wearable tech for elite athletes. The global market for sports analytics, valued at\u00a0$2.7 billion\u00a0in 2023, is projected to grow 22% by the end of the decade, according to market research firm Grand View Research. Should soccer talent scouts be concerned about being edged out by the arrival of AI in their industry? For Felton-Thomas, new technologies can co-exist with traditional methods. \u201cIt\u2019s more about evolution than revolution,\u201d Felton-Thomas explained. \u201cWe can\u2019t tell you when that player\u2019s actually in that match, how does he deal with adversity? What happens when he\u2019s 2-0 down? What happens when someone\u2019s shouting at him?

{"id": "2024_07_09_media_rnc-christina-bobb-deposition-dominion-voting", "text": "Christina Bobb, the indicted\u00a0RNC official\u00a0and former One America News host, is dodging a deposition in a 2020-related defamation lawsuit, according to Dominion Voting Systems, which is battling her in court. Bobb\u2019s attorneys previously argued that the Dominion defamation lawsuit, and the routine deposition they are seeking, should be paused in the wake of her\u00a0indictment in Arizona on charges related to her role in the Trump campaign\u2019s fake electors plot. She denies wrongdoing in both cases. Lawyers for Dominion told a judge Monday that the defamation case should move forward and that they can tailor document requests and deposition questions to steer clear of the specific Arizona allegations. \u201cAny deposition of Ms. Bobb, could and likely would impair Ms. Bobb\u2019s Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, extend criminal discovery beyond the limits set forth by Arizona law, potentially expose Ms. Bobb\u2019s theory to the prosecution in advance of trial, and otherwise prejudice her criminal case,\u201d Bobb\u2019s criminal attorney in the Arizona case, Thomas Jacobs, said in a past court filing. The voting technology firm\u00a0sued Bobb and the far-right cable network OAN\u00a0in 2021, as well as\u00a0other Trump allies\u00a0and\u00a0right-wing outlets\u00a0that peddled lies about the election. Lawyers for Dominion said a filing Monday that Bobb\u2019s lawyers didn\u2019t answer their emails in March and May when they tried to schedule Bobb\u2019s deposition. \u201cBobb has not produced a single document in this litigation, and simply ignored Dominion\u2019s attempts to schedule a date for her deposition, including attempts made well before the Arizona indictment,\u201d Dominion lawyers wrote, urging the judge in the DC-based case to order Bobb to sit for a deposition. After then-President Donald Trump lost the 2020 election, Bobb used her on-air role at OAN to repeatedly promote baseless conspiracy theories about the results being rigged, including by Dominion software. At the same time,\u00a0she also worked closely\u00a0with Trump\u2019s lawyers and allies to subvert the results in several battleground states that he lost by organizing illegitimate slates of Republican electors. After a shakeup at the RNC earlier this year, Bobb and other Trump loyalists assumed top leadership posts, with Bobb focusing on so-called \u201celection integrity\u201d efforts. These efforts include\u00a0new lawsuits\u00a0aimed at tightening the rules regarding mail-in ballots and restricting the availability of ballot drop boxes.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/media/rnc-christina-bobb-deposition-dominion-voting/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_09_tech_ftc-ngl-anonymous-messaging-app-teens", "text": "The Federal Trade Commission and the Los Angeles District Attorney\u2019s Office have banned a controversial anonymous messaging app from serving kids under 18, taking an unprecedented and aggressive step against what regulators called \u201crampant cyberbullying and threats against children and teens\u201d on the platform. The targeted ban is the FTC\u2019s latest move in a wider crackdown on social media companies, data brokers and other businesses that allegedly mishandle consumer data or make overhyped claims about artificial intelligence. As part of a\u00a0lawsuit\u00a0and\u00a0settlement\u00a0announced Tuesday, the app being penalized \u2014 known as NGL \u2014 will also pay $5 million to settle what FTC Chair Lina Khan said was \u201creckless disregard for kids\u2019 safety.\u201d The app will also have to implement an age gate to block its services to current and new users who are under 18 years old. The regulators wrote that the app billed itself as a \u201csafe space\u201d for teens but, in reality, preyed on them. In addition to highlighting FTC follow-through on\u00a0earlier promises to police AI hype, the lawsuit directly names the company\u2019s co-founders, reflecting recent agency commitments to\u00a0holding individual executives accountable\u00a0for corporate wrongdoing. The app, known as NGL, had been downloaded millions of times, according to the complaint. NGL is an internet abbreviation for \u201cnot gonna lie.\u201d NGL actively marketed itself to young users and violated federal laws aimed at protecting children\u2019s data, the lawsuit claimed, while its employees allegedly mocked paying users as \u201csuckers\u201d while profiting from their ignorance. In a statement, NGL co-founder Joao Figueiredo said the company had spent nearly two years cooperating with the FTC\u2019s investigation but that it disputes the agency\u2019s findings, which were approved unanimously by the five-member commission. NGL responds \u201cWe view this resolution as an opportunity to make NGL better than ever for our users and we think the agreement is in our best interest,\u201d Figueiredo said. \u201cWhile we believe many of the allegations around the youth of our user base are factually incorrect, we anticipate that the agreed upon age-gating and other procedures will now provide direction for others in our space, and hopefully improve policies generally.\u201d The settlement must still be approved by the US District Court for the Central District of California before taking effect. NGL deceptively hooked teens into subscribing to its premium service by sending them fake, anonymous messages and then promising to reveal the sender after they paid, said the complaint. The computer-generated messages were purposely written to prey on teens\u2019 social anxieties or aspirations, the lawsuit said, citing examples such as \u201cI know what you did\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ve had a crush on you for years.\u201d NGL created more than 1,000 different such messages posing as real users and sent them millions of times\u00a0to persuade teens to pay to see who sent them, the complaint said. But when users paid for information about both the fake and the real messages, sometimes as much as $9.99 a week, the app didn\u2019t show the sender\u2019s name but instead provided \u201chints\u201d such as the user\u2019s rough location or the type of device being used, according to the lawsuit. The messages started being sent in 2022, a year after the app\u2019s lackluster launch, the complaint said. After users began suspecting the fake messages, many wrote negative reviews of the app and some even called it a scam, according to the lawsuit. NGL had allegedly boasted in its marketing that the app was a \u201csafe space for teens\u201d and that it used AI-based content moderation to protect users. Behind the scenes, however, the app\u2019s co-founders allegedly ignored or denigrated users who complained, with Figueiredo responding \u201clol\u201d in an internal message to a report about one upset customer, according to the lawsuit. The lawsuit and settlement are another example of how Khan, a vocal critic of the tech industry, has made regulating digital data a hallmark of her tenure. In addition to\u00a0warning\u00a0that generative artificial intelligence may \u201cturbocharge\u201d fraud and scams, Khan has proposed multiple regulations that would clamp down on how businesses may collect, use and share consumer data. One would crack down on what she calls a \u201ccommercial surveillance\u201d industry, while another seeks to\u00a0expand the FTC\u2019s enforcement\u00a0of a landmark children\u2019s privacy law. The FTC is also currently\u00a0seeking to prohibit Meta\u00a0from monetizing children\u2019s data, a move that company has challenged in court. In 2022, the FTC\u00a0forced Epic Games, maker of the hit video game \u201cFortnite,\u201d to pay $520 million to settle allegations that it used sneaky user-interface tricks known as \u201cdark patterns\u201d to dupe users into making in-game purchases. Rising ire from regulators The FTC move comes against the backdrop of a flurry of state legislation seeking to limit young people\u2019s access to social media. In another first this year, New York\u00a0approved legislation\u00a0that regulates the algorithms powering social media feeds on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and other apps. States such as\u00a0Arkansas,\u00a0Florida,\u00a0Louisiana\u00a0and many others have also passed laws clamping down on social media companies\u2019 approach to teens. Opponents, however, say the laws violate the First Amendment rights of teens and the Supreme Court has\u00a0agreed to consider\u00a0the constitutionality of age-based website restrictions in its next term. Highlighting the groundbreaking nature of the NGL settlement, FTC Commissioner Andrew Ferguson described Tuesday\u2019s action as a \u201cnovel\u201d use of the agency\u2019s legal powers. For the first time, he said in a statement, the FTC claimed that NGL broke the law \u201cby marketing an anonymous messaging app to children and teenagers despite knowing that anonymous messaging apps are harmful to these groups.\u201d \u201cThis alleged conduct, tailormade to manipulate the vulnerable teenage psyche, was reprehensible and unfair,\u201d Ferguson said. But, he argued, the public should not interpret the lawsuit to mean that it is illegal in general to market any anonymous messaging app to teens. On Tuesday, the FTC credited the consumer advocacy group Fairplay and the social media critic Kristin Bride for \u201cinvaluable assistance\u201d on the NGL investigation. Last year, Bride testified before Congress in a\u00a0high-profile hearing\u00a0about social media\u2019s risks for teens, recounting how her teenage son Carson died by suicide in 2020 after receiving a barrage of anonymous cyberbullying messages. In October, Bride and Fairplay\u00a0wrote to the FTC\u00a0calling for an agency investigation into NGL and accusing it of unfair and deceptive business practices in violation of federal law. In a statement Tuesday, Bride applauded the lawsuit and settlement. \u201cThis dangerous business model keeps kids engaged while struggling to identify their unknown harassers so that these companies can profit from more data collection,\u201d Bride said. \u201cIt is unconscionable that NGL would not only charge vulnerable teens for useless hints as to who was messaging them but that the developers themselves were sending harassing messages to teens and joking about it as parents expressed cyberbullying concerns.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/tech/ftc-ngl-anonymous-messaging-app-teens/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_01_media_redbox-bankruptcy", "text": "The parent company of Redbox, those distinctive, red-colored kiosks at grocery stores that sell or rent DVDs, has filed for bankruptcy after enduring months of financial struggle. Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment (CSSE) revealed in a filing that it has nearly $1 billion in debt and owes millions of dollars to several entertainment companies including the BBC and Sony Pictures, plus to retailers ranging from Walmart to Walgreens. Filings show that the company took on about $325 million in debt following its purchase of Redbox in 2022 from private equity giant Apollo Global Management. The plan was to make it into an entertainment conglomerate, combining the DVD rental business with its free streaming services, like Crackle, the entertainment platform once owned by Sony. Those plans didn\u2019t pan out, hindered by dual Hollywood strikes that limited production of fresh content and the decline of people renting physical DVDs that even forced rival Netflix to quit that part of its business last year. CSSE declined to comment. Deadline previously reported that Redbox hadn\u2019t paid employees for a week, and medical benefits have been suspended. Filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy could help the company fix those issues if its plans are approved by a court in Delaware. The company\u2019s publishing arm, which produces those ubiquitous self-help books that were once a worldwide phenomenon, isn\u2019t affected by the bankruptcy filing of its entertainment unit.

{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk", "text": "In a year of wild tech stories that has seen Elon Musk transform Twitter, cryptocurrency exchange FTX collapse and Silicon Valley Bank implode, this week\u2019s whiplash-inducing turmoil at OpenAI is among the most captivating. Sam Altman \u2014 the leader of one of the world\u2019s most influential AI companies, OpenAI, and perhaps the\u00a0most visible figure in the fledgling industry \u2014 was fired Friday night by the startup\u2019s directors in a surprise move. Less than five days later, he\u2019s back as the company\u2019s CEO, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. The series of extraordinary events unfolded just days after OpenAI held its\u00a0first-ever developer conference, where it laid out new, commercialized versions of its technology, including the option to customize its ChatGPT AI chatbot. If you\u2019re just catching up, here\u2019s what you missed from a week so incredible you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking the script could have been written by an early version of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Friday Around 3 p.m. ET, Altman joined a Google Meet call with most of OpenAI\u2019s board that had been convened by fellow co-founder and OpenAI chief scientist\u00a0Ilya Sutskever, during which Altman was fired and told that the news would soon be made public. Within the next half hour, the board also informed Greg Brockman, another co-founder and OpenAI president, that he would be removed from the board. Around 3:30 p.m. ET, OpenAI publicly announced that it had fired Altman over concerns that he was not always truthful with the board. The board said Mira Murati, the company\u2019s chief technology officer, would become interim CEO. OpenAI\u2019s strategic partners, including its biggest financial backer Microsoft, were also reportedly informed of Altman\u2019s ouster just minutes before the board\u2019s announcement. Hours after being fired, Altman posted on X that he \u201cloved working with such talented people\u201d and that he would have \u201cmore to say about what\u2019s next later.\u201d Brockman promptly quit. \u201cPlease don\u2019t spend any time being concerned. We will be fine,\u201d Brockman\u00a0said in a Friday post\u00a0on X. \u201cGreater things coming soon.\u201d A key factor in the CEO\u2019s firing was\u00a0tension between Altman, who favored developing AI\u00a0more aggressively, and members of the OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the unfolding events. Saturday Within 24 hours of Altman being fired, reports emerged that he and other ex-OpenAI loyalists were mulling plans for their own venture. OpenAI\u2019s board was also reportedly having second thoughts and considering asking the ousted CEO to return. Sunday By Sunday afternoon, Altman was\u00a0back at OpenAI\u2019s headquarters\u00a0\u2014 this time with a guest badge \u2014 to negotiate his potential return. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reportedly mediated the discussion. A 5 p.m. PT deadline was reportedly set for the board to agree to Altman\u2019s demands, including adding a seat for Microsoft, and reinstating him as CEO. But those talks broke down. As Sunday turned into Monday, Nadella tweeted that Altman, along with Brockman, would join Microsoft to run a new AI research group. At OpenAI, the group found a new interim CEO: Emmett Shear, the former CEO of Amazon\u2019s streaming service, Twitch. Murati would return to her role as OpenAI\u2019s chief technology officer. Monday In a post on X early Monday, Shear, who left his role at Twitch in March, described the chance to join OpenAI as \u201ca once-in-a-lifetime\u201d opportunity. He added that the company would hire an independent investigator to report on what happened in the lead-up to Altman\u2019s firing. But OpenAI employees were not convinced. More than 500 staffers signed an open letter calling on the company\u2019s board to resign and reinstate Altman and Brockman. They also threatened to follow the co-founders to Microsoft if their demands were not met. Altman posted on X, saying, \u201cwe have more unity and commitment and focus than ever before. we are all going to work together some way or other, and i\u2019m so excited. one team, one mission.\u201d The drama was far from over.\u00a0The Verge reported Monday afternoon\u00a0that Altman and Brockman could still return to OpenAI if the board members who fired him resign. And Nadella, speaking to CNBC, said he was \u201copen to both options\u201d when asked whether Altman would actually join Microsoft. \u201cLook, that is for the OpenAI board and management and the employees to choose,\u201d Nadella said. \u201cWe chose to explicitly partner with OpenAI and we want to continue to do so, and obviously, that depends on the people of OpenAI staying there or coming to Microsoft.\u201d Tuesday Altman\u00a0was reinstated late Tuesday as OpenAI\u2019s CEO, the company said on X. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman\u00a0wrote\u00a0that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his\u00a0post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it has backed with billions to bolster its ambitions in developing AI. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Nadella\u00a0said\u00a0on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_02_business_state-farm-california-rate-hikes", "text": "State Farm is seeking increases of as much as 52% for some of its residential insurance rates in California, which could ramp up the financial burden for many homeowners and renters in the state\u2019s troubled insurance market. It\u2019s the third major change for State Farm in California within the last year. The insurer stopped selling insurance for new homes in the state last summer, citing wildfire risks and skyrocketing construction costs. The insurer, California\u2019s largest, is requesting a 30% rate increase for its homeowners line, a 52% rate increase for renters and a 36% rate increase for condominium owners. State Farm was previously approved for a 20% hike for homeowners\u2019 and condominium owners\u2019 policies last December. The company said in a statement that its state subsidiary, State Farm General, is \u201cworking toward its long-term sustainability in California\u201d and that the rate increases are \u201cdriven by increased costs and risk and are necessary for State Farm General to deliver on the promises the company makes every day to its customers.\u201d \u201cWe continue to look for ways to maintain competitive rates and help our customers manage their risk,\u201d a State Farm spokesperson said. \u201cCustomers with questions are encouraged to speak with their local State Farm agent. The agent can review the customer\u2019s policy, including deductibles and coverages.\u201d The California Department of Insurance has to approve the rate changes. \u201cState Farm General\u2019s latest rate filings raise serious questions about its financial condition,\u201d California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara said in a statement. \u201cThis has the potential to affect millions of California consumers and the integrity of our residential property insurance market.\u201d Lara said his agency \u201cwill investigate State Farm\u2019s financial situation, including a rate hearing on these applications if necessary.\u201d He added that \u201cnothing changes today for State Farm policyholders as a result of these filings. We are going to lead with facts to make sure Californians are protected.\u201d The company made its previous decision to hike rates \u201cdue to historic increases in construction costs outpacing inflation, rapidly growing catastrophe exposure, and a challenging reinsurance market,\u201d according to a May 2023 statement from State Farm General. (The changes didn\u2019t affect its existing auto insurance coverage.) California has seen an average of\u00a0more than 7,000 wildfires each year, consuming an average of over 2 million acres, over the past several years, according to data from the governor\u2019s office. Scientists and California authorities blame the climate crisis for the intensity of the fire seasons. A few months following State Farm\u2019s decision to stop offering new home insurance, Farmers Insurance also started limiting new homeowners insurance policies in California, citing high costs and wildfire risks. Farmers is the second-largest provider of homeowners insurance in the state, after State Farm. It\u2019s getting\u00a0harder and harder to find homeowners insurance\u00a0in the states that are the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. In Florida, Farmer\u2019s also recently stopped offering its home, auto and umbrella policies in the hurricane-prone state. \u2013CNN\u2019s Cheri Mossburg contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/business/state-farm-california-rate-hikes/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "business"}}

As was widely expected, the Federal Reserve left its benchmark interest rate unchanged for its seventh meeting in a row on Wednesday. People carrying variable-rate debt like credit cards and those seeking a loan won\u2019t be happy given that the Fed\u2019s rate, which directly and indirectly affects consumers\u2019 borrowing costs, remains at a 23-year high. Those rates will likely stay high for a while. At this point, only one cut is seen as likely before the end of the year, according to US central bankers\u2019 latest summary of economic projections. But whenever the cuts start, they may be small. \u201cAbsent a complete about-face from the economy, interest rates aren\u2019t likely to come down soon enough, or fast enough, to provide meaningful relief to borrowers. Utilize zero-percent credit card balance transfer offers, shop around for lower fixed-rate personal loans and home equity loans, and channel as much income as possible toward paying down this debt as quickly as possible,\u201d said Greg McBride, Bankrate.com\u2019s chief financial analyst. But the Fed\u2019s decision leaves savers, once again, in the catbird seat when it comes to making money on their money. \u201cSavers are enjoying the best returns on savings accounts and CDs in more than 15 years, with the most competitive offers outpacing inflation. In addition, these conditions are poised to persist for the foreseeable future,\u201d McBride said. Online high-yield savings accounts The best bang for your savings can still be had in online high-yield savings accounts at FDIC-insured banks, which yield way more than today\u2019s 0.58% overall average savings rate. As of June 11, the average online savings account rate was 4.40%, according to DepositAccounts.com. And many online high-yield accounts continue to offer rates of 5% or more. Say you have $10,000 in savings. If you leave it parked in a regular savings account at 0.5%, you\u2019ll get $50 in interest for a year. If you put it instead in a 5% high-yield account, you\u2019ll get $500. A high-yield savings account is the best place to park money you\u2019ll need to cover emergencies as well as anticipated large expenses that you have to pay in the next three months to a year. As with any savings account, banks can lower the rate they offer \u2014 also known as the APY \u2014 at any time. And you can be sure they will do just that when the Fed looks like it will finally start cutting rates, McBride said. But, he added, since rates are likely to be cut in small increments, online high-yield savings accounts may continue to offer inflation-beating returns for some time. \u201cThey will still offer the best way to preserve your [money\u2019s] buying power,\u201d McBride said. Money market accounts and money market funds Money market deposit accounts and money market mutual funds are generating yields competitive with the best high-yield savings accounts. But there are important differences. Money market deposit accounts are bank products. So, assuming your bank is FDIC insured, your account is too. (Or, if your account is at a federally backed credit union, your money will be\u00a0insured by the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund.) As with high-yield accounts, you may get the best deals at an online bank. But money market accounts may have a higher minimum deposit requirement than a high-yield account. Money market funds, by contrast, are an investment product \u2014 they generate return by investing in short-term, low-risk debt instruments and are currently yielding an average of 5.12%, according to the Crane 100 Money Fund Index. Such funds are a good place to park cash you have in your brokerage account that you may want to use at some point to buy equities or bonds, McBride said. Money market funds are not FDIC-insured, but any brokerage you use should be insured by the\u00a0Securities Investor Protection Corporation, which\u00a0covers your funds up to a limit if your brokerage ever goes under. Certificates of deposit CDs are still a great place to park any money you can leave untouched for a fixed\u00a0period of time \u2014 anywhere from a few months to five years or longer. As of June 11, the average rate was 4.971% on an online one-year CD, and 3.815% on a five-year CD, according to DepositAccounts.com. While your brick-and-mortar bank may offer a CD at a good rate, you may get a better one shopping around. The easiest way to do that without having to set up an additional account at another bank is to shop for CDs through your online brokerage, which is likely to offer a wide array of CDs from many different banks. At Schwab.com, for instance, CDs on offer ranging in duration from three months all the way up to 10 years offered average annual returns over 5%, with most ranging between 5.30% and 5.45%. The highest annual average was 5.56% for a three-month CD. If you have to withdraw money before the end of a CD\u2019s term, you can always get all of your principal back but may forfeit some of the interest earned as an early withdrawal penalty. Treasury bills and notes Beyond deposit accounts, investing in short-term Treasury bills and intermediate-term Treasury notes has been another way to earn a competitive return with virtually no risk since Treasuries are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. Treasury bills come in six different maturities: 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 13 weeks, 17 weeks, 26 weeks and 52 weeks. Treasury notes mature in two, three, five, seven or 10 years. \u201cAs long as the Fed holds its rate in the 5.25% to 5.5% range, we expect most Treasury bill yields to hover around 5.25% as well,\u201d said Collin Martin, fixed income strategist at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. But, Martin added, \u201cWhile the timing of rate cuts has been pushed back, we still expect them to arrive later this year, and investors in short-term investments would likely face reinvestment risk.\u201d That\u2019s why he suggests investors consider buying some intermediate-term investments now before rates are cut if they want to lock in a higher yield for some of their money, such as Treasury notes maturing in the next four to 10 years. On Wednesday, yields on Treasury bills were north of 5% and yields on Treasury notes were north of 4%, according to Schwab.com. When deciding whether it makes sense to invest in a CD or a Treasury for the same duration, you might opt for the Treasury if you live in a high-tax state, McBride suggested, since interest on Treasuries is\u00a0exempt from state and local taxes. In all instances, the easiest way to purchase Treasuries and other bonds is to do so through your brokerage account.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/success/saving-under-high-interest-rates/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_08_business_boeing-doj-criminal-charges", "text": "Boeing has agreed to plead guilty to one charge of conspiracy to defraud the United States\u00a0for its role in two fatal 737 Max crashes,\u00a0the Justice Department said in a court filing Sunday evening. It represents yet another black eye for the company after a series of embarrassing safety blunders, but the agreement avoids what could have been more serious consequences. \ufeffIt will pay up to $487 million in fines \u2014 a fraction of the $24.8 billion that families of crash victims wanted the aircraft maker to pay. The families of victims of two fatal crashes of the 737 Max oppose the deal, the department said. The guilty plea is a severe blow to the reputation of Boeing, a company once known for the quality and safety of its commercial planes. Beyond the fatal crashes of the 737 Max jets, the company has faced a series of questions about the safety and quality of its planes.\u00a0In January, a door plug on a 737 Max flown by Alaska Airlines blew out early in a flight, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the jet and further damaging Boeing\u2019s reputation. The agreement stipulates that Boeing will have to operate under the oversight of an independent monitor \u2013 a person to be chosen by the government \u2013 for a period of three years. But that oversight and the fine did not satisfy the families of victims, according to one of their attorneys. \u201cThis sweetheart deal fails to recognize that because of Boeing\u2019s conspiracy, 346 people died,\u201d said a statement from Paul Cassell, a law professor at the University of Utah who represents many family members of the\u00a02018 Lion Air crash\u00a0and\u00a02019 Ethiopian Air crash\u00a0victims. \u201cThis deceptive and generous deal is clearly not in the public interest,\u201d he added. The families are seeking a public trial on the charges.  Justice Department defends deal The Justice Department argues that the penalties Boeing agreed to were the most serious available. It argued it won other improvements as well, including the oversight of a monitor and the demand that Boeing spend more on safety and compliance of rules when building aircraft. \u201cThis resolution protects the American public,\u201d said the DOJ\u2019s statement. \u201cBoeing will be required to make\u00a0historic investments to strengthen and integrate its compliance and safety programs. This criminal conviction demonstrates the department\u2019s commitment to holding Boeing accountable for its misconduct.\u201d The statement also raised the possibility of more legal problems ahead for Boeing and its executives. It said that while no individuals face criminal charges as a result of this agreement, \u201cDOJ is resolving only with the company \u2014 and providing\u00a0no immunity to any individual employees, including corporate executives, for any conduct.\u201d \u201cDOJ is resolving with Boeing only for misconduct that predated the 737 Max crashes \u2014 and\u00a0not providing immunity for any other corporate conduct, including the Alaska Airlines 1282 incident,\u201d it added. While no one was severely injured in that flight, CNN has confirmed that passengers and crew on that flight have received notice that they might be considered victims of a crime. But family members of victims from the two fatal plane crashes blasted the plea agreement early Monday. \u201cMiscarriage of justice is a gross understatement in describing this,\u201d said a statement from Zipporah Kuria of England who lost her father, Joseph, in the Ethiopian Airlines crash. \u201cIt is an atrocious abomination. I hope that, God forbid, if this happens again the DOJ is reminded that it had the opportunity to do something meaningful and instead chose not to.\u201d \u201cWithout full transparency and accountability nothing will change,\u201d said a statement from California resident Ike Riffel, who lost his two sons, Melvin and Bennett, in the crash. \u201cWith this deal, there will be no investigation, there will be no expert witness testimony, there will be no perpetrators of these crimes to answer the charges in court.\u201d \u201cThe penalties and conditions imposed on Boeing as a result of this plea deal are not substantively different than those that failed to change Boeing\u2019s safety culture and that resulted in the Alaska Air door blowout,\u201d said aerospace engineer Javier de Luis, who lost his sister Graziella in the second crash. \u201cWhen the next crash happens, every DOJ official that signed off on this deal will be as responsible as the Boeing executives that refuse to put safety ahead of profits.\u201d Boeing issued a brief statement saying only that it can \u201cconfirm that we have reached an agreement in principle on terms of a resolution with the Justice Department, subject to \u2026 approval of specific terms.\u201d Boeing investors appeared pleased by the terms of the deal. Shares of Boeing (BA), a component of the Dow Jones industrial average, were up 3% in morning trading. A design flaw hidden from regulators According to the charges, the company defrauded the Federal Aviation Administration during the process of certifying the 737 Max to carry its first passengers. The plane started service in 2017, but the two fatal crashes led to a 20-month grounding of the jets. Investigations revealed a design flaw in its autopilot system. Boeing has admitted responsibility for the fatal crashes, and that its employees withheld information about the design flaw from the FAA during certification. In January 2021, the federal prosecutors and Boeing reached an agreement to settle criminal charges and defer any prosecution on the matter. During a three-year probationary period that followed, Boeing agreed to improve its quality issues and transparency with the government. But the Alaska Airlines incident came just days before that probationary period was due to end, which led to a series of federal investigations into its practices. In May, the DOJ said it was\u00a0looking into bringing criminal charges\u00a0against Boeing once again due to a potential violation of that January 2021 agreement. Boeing had argued in its own court filings that it did not violate the agreement and that it should be spared prosecution. Sunday night\u2019s guilty plea, which came just before a midnight deadline set by the Justice Department, settled that issue. Cost of the guilty plea Under the original 2021 agreement, Boeing had agreed to pay $2.5 billion. But about 70% of that amount represented payments Boeing had already agreed to make to its airline customers as compensation for the 20-month grounding of the planes. Another $500 million was a fund to compensate crash victims. Only $243.6 million represented a criminal fine to the government, which would be doubled after the new guilty plea. Boeing has also agreed to spend $455 million on its compliance and safety programs over the next three years, which the government said will represent a 75% increase over what the company was spending annually on those programs. The company\u2019s various problems have caused deep financial losses since the second fatal 737 Max crash. It has posted core operating losses of $31.9 billion since the start of the 20-month grounding. It is also at risk of losing its investment-grade credit rating for the first time in its history. The company now has nearly $47 billion in long-term debt, and if its debt rating is downgraded to junk bond status, its cost of borrowing money will soar. But an additional fine in the hundreds of millions, rather than the billions, is still affordable for the company, despite its financial woes. No loss of government contracts The company avoided another serious penalty \u2014 the loss of the right to conduct business with the government. Such a penalty would have been a crippling blow for the planemaker. About 37% of its revenue in 2023 came from federal contracts. According to Richard Aboulafia, managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory, an aerospace and defense management consultant, the possibility of such a penalty was minimal as both Boeing and the federal government are heavily reliant on each other. Despite its troubles over the last five years, Boeing is still a key component of the US economy. It remains the nation\u2019s largest exporter, and has nearly 150,000 US employees. The company estimates its economic impact at $79 billion, supporting 1.6 million direct and indirect jobs at more than 9,900 suppliers spread across all 50 states. Its only significant rival for commercial aircraft, European manufacturer Airbus, has a backlog of more than 8,000 jet orders, meaning any Boeing customer placing an order for an Airbus plane today would have to wait nearly a decade for it to be delivered. The fraud charges encompassed in Sunday\u2019s guilty plea, and the investigations into the Alaska Airlines incident, are hardly the only safety issues being raised about Boeing planes currently. The Alaska Air incident brought renewed attention to a series of events, large and small, raising safety concerns aboard Boeing jets. More than a dozen whistleblowers who work or worked at the company or its contractors have come forward in recent months to speak to Congressional investigators and the media about their concerns procedures and practices at Boeing. Allegations include knowingly using flawed parts on planes and assembly procedures that did not meet Boeing\u2019s own standards. In each case, Boeing said it investigated the allegations and addressed them appropriately. Those allegations and the Alaska Air incident have resulted in a steady drumbeat of safety issues and incidents getting attention that might never have gotten attention in the past. For example, the FAA is in the process of publishing a notice Monday to airlines about a problem with oxygen masks on 2,600 US airplanes, spread between the 737 Max and some older versions of the 737 which could cause problems with the masks dropping down to passengers if they are needed. The problem can be addressed by inspections, according to the notice. Boeing said it had no comment on the FAA\u2019s airworthiness directive language, which was issued after Boeing had already issued a service bulletin itself to airlines that own the jets.

In a letter, Columbia President Minouche Shafik committed to holding those officials responsible for the \u201cdisturbing\u201d incident, which occurred during a May 31 panel discussion about Jewish life at an alumni event. \u201cThe incident revealed behavior and sentiments that were not only unprofessional, but also, disturbingly touched on ancient antisemitic tropes,\u201d Shafik said in the Monday statement.\u201cWhether intended as such or not, these sentiments are unacceptable and deeply upsetting, conveying a lack of seriousness about the concerns and the experiences of members of our Jewish community that is antithetical to our University\u2019s values and the standards we must uphold in our community.\u201d Columbia leaders have been under fire for months to show they are taking action to combat antisemitism on campus and protect Jewish students and staff.

BYD\u2019s CEO Wang Chuanfu and Turkey\u2019s Industry and Technology Minister Mehmet Fatih Kaci signed the agreement in Istanbul, according to a statement from the Turkish ministry Monday. Turkish President Recep Tayyip\u00a0Erdogan attended the signing ceremony, it said. \u201cWe aim to meet the growing demand for new-energy vehicles in the region and reach consumers in Europe,\u201d the statement cited BYD representatives as saying. The announcement came just days after provisional additional duties on imports of Chinese-made EVs into the European Union came into effect.\u00a0The tariffs, ranging from 17.4% to 37.6%, are aimed at stopping a flood of cheap Chinese cars built with what the EU deems unfair support from the government. Turkey is in a customs union with the EU. That means vehicles can be exported from the country to the trading bloc tariff-free. According to the agreement with Turkey, BYD will invest about $1 billion in the factory, which will be able to produce 150,000 electric and hybrid vehicles annually, and set up a research and development center for sustainable mobility technologies at the plant.

{"id": "2024_07_03_business_weight-loss-drugs-claims-nestle-food", "text": "As the use of popular weight loss and diabetes drugs like Wegovy and Ozempic skyrockets, consumer brands are scrambling to\u00a0adapt. But health professionals are warning consumers not to take medical advice from the same companies trying to sell them food, supplements and other consumables. The new GLP-1 drugs, as they\u2019re known, are prompting hopes \u2013 and fears \u2013 of a seismic shift in the food industry, potentially impacting what and how much people eat. JP Morgan said last year that users of the diabetes and weight loss drugs drugs \u2014 which help control blood sugar, slow digestion and suppress hunger \u2014 bought around 8% less food over the prior year compared with an average consumer. And a recent survey found that roughly one in eight adults in the United States has used a GLP-1 drug at some point, and that half of those \u2014 more than 15 million people \u2014 are currently using a prescription. The trend has raised alarm bells for the industry overall. \u201cPeople who are on (GLP-1 drugs) eat less calories. That\u2019s, high level, not good for people who sell calories,\u201d said Donny Kranson, portfolio manager and analyst at Vontobel Asset Management. GNC, the struggling vitamin and dietary supplement chain, is adding a dedicated section in its 2,300 US stores for people on GLP-1 medications. Daily Harvest, a meal kit service, has a GLP-1 food collection. Optavia, a branded diet plan, offers a GLP-1 support kit including nutrient dense meals and protein powder. Even food companies that are taking a more passive approach are keeping a close eye on trends, clocking items that sell well among GLP-1 users and flagging those products to Wall Street. Nestl\u00e9, the Switzerland-based food and supplement manufacturer, is taking a two-pronged approach. In May it announced a new line of frozen meals called Vital Pursuit, pitching the brand to users of weight loss drugs. The brand will include meals high in protein and fiber that are \u201cintended to be a companion for GLP-1 weight loss medication users and consumers focused on weight management.\u201d More recently, it launched a website \u2014 www.glp-1nutrition.com \u2014 which it billed as a resource for people managing their weight and using the medications. \u201cThese companies all need to find where the growth is in food,\u201d noted Kranson. But the tactic could hurt GLP-1 users who may unwittingly take medical advice from a retail site primarily interested in selling products. At best \u2018a waste of money\u2019 A visitor to Nestl\u00e9\u2019s GLP-1 nutrition site might not realize right away that it\u2019s run by Nestl\u00e9. The company\u2019s name is not in the URL. On the home page, it only appears at the very bottom. The site offers \u201cexpert tips\u201d and other information and sells an assortment of products from different brands, which don\u2019t appear to all have the same parent company. Visitors invited to \u201cBuild your GLP-1 bundle\u201d can add products to their shopping carts based on categories that correlate with potential side effects of the drugs. Some taking GLP-1 drugs have reported losing hair and muscle. In some cases, use of the drug has led to vomiting, which can be dehydrating. So the site sells protein shakes in \u201cmuscle preservation,\u201d branded hydration tablets in \u201chydration,\u201d hair growth capsules in \u201chair and skin health,\u201d and so on. But there\u2019s no evidence that everyone using GLP-1 medications should also take supplements, said Dr. Jorge Moreno, an assistant professor at the Yale School of Medicine who specializes in obesity. \u201cAdditional supplements for patients on GLP-1s are not universally recommended,\u201d he said. Physicians may advise patients take probiotics or increase their protein intake in specific situations, he said. Furthermore, \u201csupplements can have side effects on patients, and not really be beneficial to them directly,\u201d he said. Direct-to-consumer websites like Nestl\u00e9\u2019s \u201cmay at best be harmless and a waste of money,\u201d said Dr. Jody Dushay, an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School and an endocrinologist with a clinical practice focusing on medical weight management. At worst, they could lead someone to try to treat potentially severe symptoms with supplements, rather than going to a doctor. \u201cYou can really get yourself into trouble if you are malnourished, if you are someone who is losing a lot of muscle,\u201d she said, referring to some extreme reported side effects of GLP-1 drugs. Patients who think they might be experiencing side effects like these need guidance from their physicians to figure out what\u2019s going on. \u201cI\u2019m just extremely, extremely wary of this,\u201d she added in reference to Nestl\u00e9\u2019s site. \u201cAnd I think that it\u2019s probably just the tip of what\u2019s to come.\u201d In a statement, a Nestl\u00e9 spokesperson said that \u201cexpert insights provided on the site are from accredited medical doctors; however, the site is not intended to replace the advice of an individual\u2019s healthcare professional,\u201d adding that \u201cwe advise all GLP-1 users to consult with their healthcare professionals about the appropriate nutrition for them.\u201d The statement also pointed out that a disclaimer on the bottom of each page reinforces this position. \u201cGLP-1nutrition.com\u00a0was created to offer\u00a0nutrition information and a wide range of product options to help support the unique nutritional needs of individuals on a weight management journey, including those on GLP-1 therapy,\u201d the statement said. A lot of unknowns It\u2019s not unusual for businesses to try to profit off of consumer trends. Chipotle has a whole line of menu items that cater to different diet trends. The Atkins diet started as a meal planning system (popularly named after the cardiologist, Robert Atkins, who created it in the 1970s), but it soon became a company devoted to selling low-carb products. The keto trend gave rise to brands devoted to selling products that fit the strict regimen. Nestl\u00e9 has made clear that it sees potential in consumers trying to lose weight. \u201cYou can expect a continued new stream of products to address that need,\u201d CEO Mark Schneider told journalists in February. Conagra, which owns frozen food brands Marie Callender\u2019s, Birds Eye and Banquet, and other food and snack brands including Slim Jim and Orville Redenbacher\u2019s, is optimistic about its own frozen offerings. \u201cWe see opportunity within our portfolio,\u201d said Tom McGough, now the company\u2019s chief operating officer, during a February analyst event, citing data that shows GLP-1 users are more likely to buy certain frozen foods. That\u2019s because \u201cfrozen meals are portion-controlled, they provide vegetable nutrition and they\u2019re high in protein,\u201d he said. He also said that \u201camong GLP-1 users, consumption of both meat snacks and popcorn increase.\u201d  A Danone executive recently told Bloomberg that the company\u2019s protein yogurts \u201care flying off the shelf,\u201d thanks in part to GLP-1 users. Confident as these companies may seem, it\u2019s still too soon to tell how GLP-1s will impact users\u2019 diets in the long-term. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how the diets of people on GLP-1s change,\u201d said Dr. William Dietz, director of the STOP Obesity Alliance at George Washington University. \u201cThey could change substantially in ways that either are fine for their health or have an adverse effect on their health.\u201d Sites like Nestl\u00e9\u2019s that market supplements to GLP-1 users are \u201can attempt to really jump into this space and try to create a business based on very little data\u201d about how diets should be supplemented, if at all, he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/business/weight-loss-drugs-claims-nestle-food/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "business"}}

More than a third (35%) of homebuyers last year were between the ages of 59 and 98, according to data from the National Association of Realtors. Within that group, a majority financed their purchases. Whether taking out a new mortgage makes sense for you depends on a lot of factors, including how to prove to a lender that you\u2019re a good credit risk, plus your feelings about the debt and the ongoing cost of maintaining a home. To get a mortgage, your age won\u2019t be a factor, but your income will be If you\u2019re concerned that you may be less attractive to a mortgage banker because you\u2019ve hit retirement age, know that it is illegal to discriminate against anyone applying for a mortgage based on their age. Lenders\u2019 chief focus will be on your ability to repay your mortgage with your various sources of non-paycheck income. \u201cWhen you qualify for a mortgage, it\u2019s all based on your income,\u201d said Melissa Cohn, regional vice president at William Raveis Mortgage. That, and of course any debt you have that will soak up your income, but we\u2019ll get to that in a minute. The income sources that lenders consider, absent a regular paycheck, include: Social Security benefits, pension or annuity income, spousal benefits, disability payments, interest and dividends and your 401(k) or IRA. If a portion of your income is not subject to tax, the lender may treat it as worth 25% more. Fannie Mae offers this example: Say 15% of a $1,500 monthly Social Security benefit is tax free. That means $225 of it will not be subject to tax ($1,500 x 15%). And 25% of that amount comes to $56 ($225 x 25%). So that $56 can be added to a person\u2019s qualifying Social Security income amount ($1,500 + $56 = $1,556). If you want to use your nest egg, different methods can be used to calculate how much income it would provide. There is the asset depletion method in which your eligible assets are divided by your loan term. In the case of a 30-year mortgage, that would be 360 months. If your IRA is worth $700,000, that translates into $1,944 per month ($700,000/360). \u201cYou don\u2019t ever have to take the money out \u2014 but you can use your assets [to qualify for a mortgage] as if you were going to take the distribution,\u201d Cohn said. Another option: If you are at least 59-1/2, you can start taking monthly distributions from an IRA without penalty \u2014 or a 401(k) if your plan rules permit \u2014 and the lender will count that as income so long as you show that you have sufficient funds in the account to keep taking that same monthly distribution for three years. Once you close on your home, Cohn said, you can reduce or stop taking distributions if you choose. That assumes you are not yet in your 70s when the IRS requires you to start taking minimum distributions, said Mark Luscombe, a principal analyst at Wolters, Kluwer Tax & Accounting. Burdened by debt? Lenders will also assess your debt-to-income ratio, because no matter how much income you have, the big question is how much of it will be consumed by your debts. The debt portion is composed of your expected mortgage payment plus any credit card, student loan, car loan or other outstanding debt you may have. Generally speaking, for conventional loans your DTI ratio can be up to 50%, Cohen said. That ratio falls to between 43% and 45% if you\u2019re taking out a jumbo loan, she added. A jumbo loan exceeds the conforming loan limits in the area you want to buy. But ideally your debt level will fall well below these top limits, both for the lender\u2019s sake and yours. And, of course, the higher your credit score, the better the interest rate you can get on a mortgage. What you should consider before taking out a mortgage Even before seeking a mortgage, get a good grasp on your expected monthly income and expenses in retirement. Compared to pre-retirement earnings, \u201cMost (new retirees) see a decrease in income,\u201d said certified financial planner Lori Trawinski, director of finance and employment at AARP. While some expenses may also decline \u2014 e.g., work-related costs like commuting \u2014 others may increase over time, Trawinski said, like medical costs, property taxes, home insurance and utilities. Of course, you can downsize and move to a lower-cost area. But if you stay near where you lived during your career, your expenses are likely to rise over time. Also, Trawinski noted, if you\u2019re married, consider what will happen to your household income when one spouse dies. This will help you assess your future comfort level in carrying a mortgage. \u201cPeople often fail to plan for the death of a spouse. You can take a big hit to your income when that happens,\u201d she said. If you do move to a new state or region, weigh renting first. You can get a better sense of the cost of living in the area and decide whether it\u2019s a good fit for you. As Stork put it, \u201cFlorida in August is not as fun as Florida in January.\u201d How much are you really willing to take on? All the usual financial decisions that go into homebuying apply no matter your age. But, in retirement especially, you don\u2019t want to take on more debt than necessary, since the cost of a mortgage is fixed, but the returns on your investments, the housing market and your health needs are variable. At the very least, Stork said, consider whether you can put enough money down \u2014 at least 20% \u2014 to avoid having to pay private mortgage insurance. Beyond that, consider whether you feel comfortable keeping up \u2014 and paying for \u2014 maintenance on a home. Maintenance might amount to 2% a year of your home\u2019s value, Stork said. That amounts to $10,000 a year on a $500,000 home. Maintenance is essential in preserving the value of your house should you ever decide to sell. How would your mortgage interest rate compare to a reasonable rate of return on your investments? The decision to get a mortgage was a lot easier for retirees when rates were historically low \u2014 roughly 3% \u2014 and their nest eggs were earning a lot more. \u201cBut at today\u2019s rates it\u2019s a much harder calculation,\u201d Stork said. This is especially the case if you\u2019re a very conservative investor. \u201cIf your CDs are earning 4% and a mortgage would cost you 7%, you will lose money every day on that decision,\u201d Stork explained. To get the truest reading on what makes financial sense, compare mortgage expenses to your investment returns on an after-tax basis, Stork noted.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/01/success/buying-house-in-retirement-mortgage/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "business"}}

That\u2019s the shared vision of NASA and Nokia, who have partnered to set up a cellular network on the Moon to help lay the building blocks for long-term human presence on other planets. A SpaceX rocket is due to launch this year \u2014 the exact date has yet to be confirmed \u2014 carrying a simple 4G network to the Moon. The lander will install the system at the Moon\u2019s south pole and then it will be remotely controlled from Earth. \u201cThe first challenge to getting a network up and running is having a space-qualified cellular equipment that meets the appropriate size, weight, and power requirements, as well as being deployed without a technician,\u201d Walt Engelund, deputy associate administrator for programs at NASA\u2019s Space Technology Mission Directorate, told CNN. No less of a challenge, it will need to operate in the harsh lunar environment of extreme temperatures and radiation. The 4G network unit is being built by Nokia\u2019s Bell Labs using a range of off-the-shelf commercial components. It will be loaded onto a lander made by US company Intuitive Machines, and once deployed it will connect the lander via radio equipment to two roaming vehicles with their own special mission: to search for ice. One of the vehicles, the Lunar Outpost rover, will explore the area known as Shackleton Connecting Ridge, while the other, the Micro-Nova hopper, will plunge into a crater to scan for unprecedented up-close evidence of Moon ice. Images of ice \u2014 transmitted back to the lander and then Earth in near real-time via the cellular network \u2014 would be a world-first. Lunar ice could be used to create breathable oxygen, and even fuel that could eventually be used to launch Mars missions from the Moon. For NASA\u2019s Artemis program, which aims to return astronauts to the moon this decade, cellular connectivity is invaluable. Currently, astronauts talk to each other by radio, but NASA wants a lunar communications system capable of supporting high-resolution video and science data, said Engelund \u2014 especially as Artemis missions become more sophisticated. \u201cBeing able to communicate on the Moon is critical to Artemis \u2014 as critical as any other mission element like power, water to drink, and air to breathe,\u201d said Engelund. \u201cEventually, this effort will help establish a lunar communications network that could give our explorers the ability to beam scientific data back, confer with mission control, and talk to their families, as if they were walking down the street on their cellphones.\u201d It could lay the groundwork for an off-world internet not dissimilar to that of Earth\u2019s. Personal devices could connect to such networks, allowing \ufeffspace colonists to use smartphones that can access all the apps and services available to those back on Earth. NASA selected Bell Labs as part of its Tipping Point initiative, a series of partnerships with companies to develop technologies for future missions that puts them in prime position for key roles in the future space economy. Bell Labs was given a $14.1 million grant in 2020, and in January, Nokia was selected by the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to begin working on a communications services infrastructure that will eventually serve as the \u201cframework for the lunar economy.\u201d \u201cA future lunar economy will critically depend on communication technologies to collect and analyze data, share information, and maintain and control operations,\u201d Thierry Klein, president of Bell Labs Solutions Research, told CNN. \u201cThis includes sustaining a semi-permanent or permanent human presence on the Moon, as well as automated robotic operations for transportation, resource mining, mineral processing and scientific data collection.\u201d There are potential commercial benefits for Earthly business ventures too. If a network can withstand the journey into orbit, then deploy and endure autonomously amid the vacuum of space, wildly fluctuating temperatures and cosmic radiation, it will be able to survive the harshest locations on Earth \u2014 such as polar ice caps, deserts, or offshore platforms. \u201cEspecially when it comes to remote deployments, industrial sites, public safety, emergency response, disaster recovery or defense, it is highly beneficial to have compact, low-footprint network equipment that can be easily transported and deployed anywhere,\u201d Klein said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/24/tech/nokia-moon-4g-network-nasa-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "business"}}
