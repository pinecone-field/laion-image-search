{"id": "2024_06_17_business_boeing-ceo-calhoun-testimony", "text": "Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun plans to apologize for Boeing\u2019s recent safety failures in Senate testimony Tuesday and admit to problems with the company culture, but he\u2019ll push back on whistleblower claims that the company retaliated against those who brought safety issues to light. \u201cMuch has been said about Boeing\u2019s culture. We\u2019ve heard those concerns loud and clear,\u201d he will say in prepared remarks released by Boeing Monday afternoon. \u201cOur culture is far from perfect, but we are taking action and making progress. We understand the gravity, and we are committed to moving forward.\u201d The \u201cfar from perfect\u201d remark is a massive understatement. Boeing has been under intense scrutiny with numerous federal investigations and congressional hearings since a January 5 Alaska Air Boeing 737 Max flight had a door plug blow off, leaving a gaping hole in both the plane and Boeing\u2019s reputation. Boeing has been ordered by the Federal Aviation Administration to improve its safety issues before it can resume normal production, causing problems for airlines that can\u2019t get the planes they ordered. And that, in turn, has meant higher fares for passengers, who have had their faith the company\u2019s planes sorely tested. The hearing Tuesday by the Senate\u2019s permanent subcommittee on investigations is entitled \u201cBoeing\u2019s broken safety culture.\u201d It is just the latest congressional hearing this year about safety issues at Boeing but the first time Calhoun is testifying in his more than four years running the troubled company. He will be joined by Howard McKenzie, Boeing\u2019s chief engineer. At an April 17 hearing Boeing engineer Sam Salehpour testified that Boeing is putting out defective planes because he and others who complain faced pressure not to do so. \u201cI have serious concerns about the safety of the 787 and 777 aircraft, and I\u2019m willing to take on professional risk to talk about them,\u201d Salehpour said in his opening statement. He said when he raised concerns, \u201cI was ignored. I was told not to create delays. I was told, frankly, to shut up.\u201d Calhoun denies that is the case currently at Boeing in his prepared remarks. \u201cWe are committed to making sure every employee feels empowered to speak up if there is a problem,\u201d he\u2019ll say, according to the prepared remarks. \u201cWe also have strict policies in place to prohibit retaliation against employees who come forward. It is our job to listen, regardless of how we obtain feedback, and handle it with the seriousness it deserves.\u201d Will there be changes? Despite the attention the hearing is expected to garner, it\u2019s unlikely to produce significant change at the company, said Richard Aboulafia, managing partner for AeroDynamic Consultancy, an aerospace advisory firm. \u201cNothing has produced change (at Boeing) except frustration from a bunch of airline customers,\u201d said Aboulafia. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what will change as a consequence of this. He (Calhoun) needs to go. He has shown a strong desire to double down on what\u2019s bad.\u201d A preliminary investigation of the Alaska Air incident has found that the plane left a Boeing factory two months before the incident without the four bolts needed to hold the door plug in place. And Boeing has yet to produce the paperwork to identify who in the factory installed the door plug without the bolts. It has been harshly criticized by members of Congress and safety regulators and will likely face more criticism Tuesday. Calhoun has already met with members of Congress since the Alaska Air incident, albeit behind closed doors. He has also made numerous public statements to Boeing employees and to investors since the Alaska Air incident. \u201cWe caused the problem, and we understand that,\u201d he told investors in January during a call after reporting its fifth straight annual loss. \u201cWhatever conclusions (from the investigations) are reached, Boeing is accountable for what happened. Whatever the specific cause of the accident might turn out to be, an event like this simply must not happen on an airplane that leaves one of our factories. We simply must be better.\u201d Apologies to families, passengers Calhoun\u2019s prepared remarks begin with an apology to the family members of the victims of two fatal 737 Max crashes. Some of those family members plan to attend the hearing. Between them, 346 people were killed in the 2018 and 2019 crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia, leading to to a 20-month grounding of the jet to fix a design flaw that caused the crashes. \u201cWe are deeply sorry for your losses,\u201d he\u2019ll say in his opening comments. \u201cNothing is more important than the safety of the people who step on board our airplanes. Every day we seek to honor the memory of those lost.\u201d He also plans to again apologize to the passengers and crew of the Alaska Air flight in January. \u201cWe deeply regret the impact that the Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 accident had on Alaska Airlines\u2019 team and its passengers, and we are grateful to the pilots and crew for safely landing the plane,\u201d he\u2019ll say. \u201cWe are thankful that there were no fatalities.\u201d But experts say that it was sheer luck that no one was killed in the Alaska Air incident. This could very well be Calhoun\u2019s only time testifying on Capitol Hill. He has announced plans to retire before the end of this year. His successor has yet to be selected. Beyond Tuesday\u2019s hearing, and the numerous federal investigations it faces, the company could still face criminal liability from the original certification process of the 737 Max. In January of 2021 Boeing agreed to a probationary period, which deferred any prosecution on those charges and which would have exempted it from criminal liability in the crashes. But the January 5 incident aboard the Alaska Air flight happened just days before the end of the probationary period. In May the Justice Department notified Boeing that it was now subject to criminal prosecution. Boeing has denied the Alaska Air incident violated the deferred prosecution agreement and is challenging any potential criminal liability in court. The family members planning to attend Tuesday\u2019s hearing say they want to see Boeing prosecuted criminally.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/business/boeing-ceo-calhoun-testimony/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/23/2024", "section": "business"}}

However, it\u2019s clear that there is something different about Dex; she\u2019s an entirely virtual \u201cdigital human,\u201d designed by a startup in the UK. For her performances, Dex is displayed on a video screen or as a holographic projection, with her mixes created by humans. She is animated using Unreal Engine \u2014 a 3D modeling software widely used in video games \u2014 combined with motion-capture. Generative artificial intelligence allows her to remember information and respond to questions, using a voice also generated by AI. \u201cShe\u2019s probably one of the only digital humans in the performance space that you can have a conversation and interact with,\u201d says Denise Harris, CCO of startup Sum Vivas. \u201cYou can ask her anything. She is a genius about music.\u201d Last month, Dex performed at Digital Fashion Weeks in New York, Paris and Milan, and she has modeled outfits by Prada and Louis Vuitton at digital fashion events. For Liverpool-based Sum Vivas she\u2019s a \u201cshowpiece\u201d for more practical applications. The company is now developing digital humans that can \u201clisten\u201d to people\u2019s questions and converse in real time. \u201cShellie\u201d can provide product information as an avatar on company websites, while \u201cArif\u201d is set to direct passengers and answer questions as a multilingual concierge on screens at airports. According to CEO and founder Rob Sims, digital humans can help bridge the gap between AI technology and people. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve found is when people start working with and conversing with a digital human, they very quickly suspend disbelief,\u201d Sims tells CNN. \u201cIt becomes natural.\u201d AI explosion Since OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT was launched in November 2022, considerable hype has surrounded the potential of generative AI \u2014 artificial intelligence powered by huge datasets of information, capable of generating text outputs in a conversational way. Record levels of investment into generative AI have followed, with over $21 billion poured into the industry during the first nine months of last year, according to data insights company Pitchbook. In March 2023, Google launched Bard (recently renamed Gemini) and around the same time Anthropic released its AI assistant Claude. As generative AI chatbots become increasingly ubiquitous, Sum Vivas is one of several companies looking to make them more human. US and New Zealand-based UneeQ has developed animated conversational \u201cdigital humans\u201d that can be used as virtual sales reps and customer service agents on company websites, and this month it debuted Sama 2.0, an animated cabin crew member that answers questions on Qatar Airways\u2019 website and app. Microsoft recently announced that users of its Azure software would be able to create lifelike avatars capable of turning text prompts into animated speech. However, there are widespread concerns about the impact AI could have on the job market.  \u201cWhen we rely on automated tools, what skills are we losing in the process?\u201d asks Jennifer Ding, senior researcher at the Alan Turing Institute, the UK\u2019s national institute for data science and artificial intelligence. \u201cIn some ways, we think of AI as something that\u2019s helping us or augmenting our work,\u201d she says. \u201cHowever, alongside, this fear of replacement is bubbling up more and more.\u201d Harris, however, points to new opportunities within digital human design and development. \u201cEvery scenario that we found, we\u2019re creating jobs and working in harmony with people rather than taking away jobs,\u201d she says. \u201cDigital humans, first and foremost, should work with other human colleagues,\u201d adds Sims. \u201cWe\u2019ll move into a stage where digital humans will start to become just another member of the team, with added benefits for that team, and obviously the customers they serve.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/business/digital-humans-ai-dj-dex-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/23/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2022_04_27_business_diamonds-manmade-demand", "text": "It\u2019s proposal season, and engagements are on the rise. So are factory-made diamond sales. Not that you\u2019d know the difference. Man-made diamonds look the same as naturally occurring ones. The only noticeable difference is the price tag. \u201cThe result is really stunning,\u201d said Edahn Golan, an independent diamond industry analyst. He said March data showed the number of engagement rings sold that featured a manufactured diamond jumped 63% compared to last year, while the number of engagement rings sold with a natural diamond declined 25% in the same period. Going back by another month, to February, the data showed the number of rings sold with lab diamonds that month surged even more, to 80% compared to a year earlier while the number fell by 13% for natural diamond engagement rings.  \u201cThe big fear in the natural diamonds industry is that consumers will start accepting lab-grown diamonds in engagement rings,\u201d he said. Too late. \u201cIt\u2019s actually happening.\u201d  Tide is shifting Why are consumers flocking to man-made diamonds? Cost is the most obvious reason. The average retail price of the most popular one carat round man-made diamond for an engagement ring in March was $2,318, Golan said. \u201cThis is substantially less \u2013 as much as 73% cheaper \u2013 than a natural diamond of the same size, cut and clarity as the man-made diamond, which would cost $8,740,\u201d he said. Plus, the lower cost allows couples to buy a bigger stone.  \u201cA lab diamond is a real diamond, but maybe it took a few weeks to make it,\u201d said Golan. \u201cNatural diamonds were formed over 800 million to three billion years and there isn\u2019t an infinite supply of them.\u201d  This makes natural diamonds quite a bit more expensive, and prices are likely to rise as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has tightened the supply chain for natural raw diamonds. The sanctions directly target Alrosa, partly owned by the Russian government, which the US government identified as the world\u2019s largest diamond mining company, accounting for 28% of global diamond output. Man-made diamonds are also becoming popular as consumers are more aware and educated about them, said Dan Moran, a third-generation diamond expert and owner of LA-based fine jeweler Concierge Diamonds. Moran said the typical buyer of man-made diamonds is typically younger than 40 and very budget conscious. Mined diamonds have a controversial history that\u2019s tied to the use of child labor in some African diamond mines as well as sales of illegally-traded \u201cconflict diamonds\u201d that fund conflict in war-torn areas. Among Millennials and Gen Z, their eco-conscious mindset and ethical concerns about natural diamond sourcing is another factor influencing their preference for non-traditional engagement rings, according to a report from wedding planning website The Knot. Small but growing share of the diamond market Although its slice is growing, the market share for man-made diamonds remains relatively small. Currently, about 7% of the specialty diamond jewelry market is represented by man-made diamonds, up from 3% in 2020, said Golan.  Some major jewelry retailers are driving the effort to take man-made diamonds mainstream. In 2021, the world\u2019s largest jewelry company, Pandora\n            \n                (PANDY), made a major shift by announcing it would stop using mined diamonds and would swap to lab-created diamonds in its jewelry.  Pandora said it\u2019s instituting the change as part of an effort to sell sustainable jewelry, and also because consumers increasingly are asking for it. Signet,\n            \n                (SIG) the largest jewelry company in the United States (which owns Zales, Kay Jewelers and Jared chains) called out the popularity of lab diamond jewelry in its March earnings call with analysts. Calling it a \u201cfast-growing category\u201d in its jewelry portfolio, Signet CEO Virginia Drosos told analysts that lab-created diamonds are among the big jewelry trends she expects this year.  The company said it has expanded its man-made bridal jewelry selection in both its Zales and Kay Jewelers stores in response to the increased demand.  Fine jewelry brand Charles and Colvard, which makes lab-created diamonds, said consumers don\u2019t just want to look good with the jewelry they are wearing, they also want to feel good about it. \u201cAs the momentum for conscious consumerism grows, the surge towards lab grown diamonds isn\u2019t surprising,\u201d said Don O\u2019Connell, president and CEO of Charles & Colvard. \u201c[Consumers] want to know the origins of their stones and be reassured they\u2019re conflict-free. They\u2019re embracing the choice to purchase a piece of fine jewelry that aligns with their values.\u201d Lab-grown diamond brand VRAI said the pandemic, too, has sparked attention and action toward social and environmental issues. It said consumers are being more thoughtful and reassessing their purchasing habits, as well as the companies and industries they are supporting. There is, however, one important consideration for anyone buying lab-created diamonds: Man-made diamonds have little resale value.  So while you may not be able to tell a natural diamond from a factory made variety, someone with a trained eye can, said Golan. Once a stone is identified as a factory diamond, even though you paid a lot less for it, you also won\u2019t get much for it.  But the value of a ring isn\u2019t just monetary. \u201cAs a professional in the industry, I am asked all the time by people about what I think about a ring they have,\u201d said Moran, of Concierge Jewelers. \u201cI always say, if you love it, be happy with it. An engagement ring is a symbol of commitment and enduring love.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/27/business/diamonds-manmade-demand/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/23/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_20_tech_tiktok-court-filing-biden-administration", "text": "TikTok ramped up its attacks on the Biden administration Thursday over a law that could ban the popular app from the United States, arguing in a court filing that US TikTok users could be forced to live on an \u201cisland\u201d of content disconnected from the rest of the world if the platform is forced to find a new owner. The legal filing also publicizes, for the first time, the text of a draft agreement between TikTok and the US government that the company claims would have addressed national security concerns linked to the app but that was allegedly discarded in favor of legislation that TikTok argues violates the First Amendment. Thursday\u2019s filing marks TikTok\u2019s opening salvo in a pivotal case that could not only determine the fate of an app used by 170 million Americans but also how courts interpret the First Amendment and its relationship to all online speech. The Justice Department declined to comment. TikTok has insisted it is not possible for its Chinese parent ByteDance to divest from the app \u2013 \u201cnot possible technologically, commercially, or legally\u201d \u2013 and not by the January 2025 deadline laid out by the law that President Joe Biden signed in April. \u201cEven if divestiture were feasible, TikTok in the United States would still be reduced to a shell of its former self, stripped of the innovative and expressive technology that tailors content to each user,\u201d the company wrote in its brief. \u201cIt also would become an island, preventing Americans from exchanging views with the global TikTok community.\u201d That is because the law TikTok is challenging prohibits the type of data-sharing agreements that would be necessary to display international TikTok content to US TikTok users, the company claimed in its filing. That dire warning echoed claims in a related legal brief filed by TikTok content creators Thursday. The group of creators, which includes a football coach, a sexual assault survivor advocate and a US Air Force veteran, argued that the challenged law would prevent them from choosing where and how to express themselves, as well as their First Amendment right to receive others\u2019 speech. Meanwhile, TikTok\u2019s focus on the draft agreement with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), a multi-agency panel charged with reviewing the national security implications of foreign investment deals, could prove central to the company\u2019s case. The proposed deal\u2019s existence, TikTok said, is evidence of a lighter-touch option that could have achieved the government\u2019s goals without a potential divestiture or app ban. Whether the Biden administration overlooked a less restrictive alternative could become a factor in a potential test of the law\u2019s constitutionality. In Thursday\u2019s filing, TikTok said the agreement was never signed despite years of negotiations and dozens of meetings and phone calls with US government officials. And after months of radio silence beginning in September 2022, CFIUS allegedly told TikTok in March 2023 that \u201c\u2018senior government officials\u2019 demanded divestment without explaining why the Agreement was insufficient.\u201d TikTok added that it then requested meetings with senior US officials but \u201creceived no meaningful responses.\u201d For years, US officials have warned of the possibility that the Chinese government could gain access to TikTok\u2019s user data through its influence over ByteDance. The Trump administration tried to ban TikTok by executive action, but that was quickly stymied by legal challenges. As Biden signed April\u2019s legislation, Trump reversed himself, saying a ban would only help TikTok\u2019s rival, Meta. Independent cybersecurity experts say the potential exists based on how China\u2019s laws are written, but that it so far remains a hypothetical and that there are many other sources of sensitive data China can freely obtain, for example by buying it on the open market. US officials have not publicly presented evidence that China has accessed US users\u2019 TikTok data. But they warn that information could be used to target propaganda or to identify intelligence targets, and they have given members of Congress classified briefings about the app\u2019s potential risks. TikTok, for its part, has denied ever giving the Chinese government access to its data and has blasted the confidential congressional briefings as part of a flawed, rushed and secretive legislative process. Attached to the company\u2019s brief on Thursday was an appendix containing the entire 103-page draft agreement. Outlining what has come to be known as Project Texas, TikTok\u2019s plan for segregating US user data from its global operation, the draft document also shows a provision that would entitle the US government to temporarily stop or even shut down TikTok\u2019s app if TikTok fails to comply with any of a dozen requirements, such as allowing qualified inspectors to review the company\u2019s source code. On Thursday, TikTok\u2019s filing said the company has so far spent $2 billion voluntarily implementing Project Texas. Also included with TikTok\u2019s detailed filing was a signed declaration from a third-party expert and former CFIUS official, Christopher Simkins, who said the proposal as written was as robust as any they had seen in two decades of experience. If implemented, Simkins said,\u00a0TikTok\u2019s national security risks \u201cwould be reduced to a LOW level.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/tech/tiktok-court-filing-biden-administration/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/23/2024", "section": "business"}}

Shares of the tech behemoth rose 2.1% to an all-time high close of $377.44 on Monday, beating the previous record of $376.17. That comes after shares of Microsoft fell 1.7% on Friday, when Sam Altman was ousted from his position at OpenAI in a boardroom coup.

{"id": "2024_06_21_business_trump-media-stock-truth-social-djt", "text": "Truth Social owner Trump Media & Technology Group has gone ice-cold. The conservative social media company has lost roughly half its market value since May 30, the day former President Donald Trump was convicted of 34 felony counts in a hush money trial. Trump Media\u2019s volatile share price (DJT) tumbled another 5% on Friday , leaving it down by a staggering 50% in the span of just three weeks. The severe selloff has erased nearly $3 billion from the estimated net worth of Trump, the controversial company\u2019s leading shareholder and chairman. The weeks-long selloff accelerated in recent days as Trump Media announced it received approval from regulators for a move that threatens to water down the holdings of shareholders. Despite the tumbling share price, some experts are warning Trump Media remains vulnerable to further losses. \u201cThe stock is still wildly overpriced,\u201d said Jay Ritter, a finance professor at the University of Florida who has studied capital markets for the past four decades. The problem is that even after the recent selloff, Trump Media is still valued in the billions of dollars, and yet it generates very little revenue. Trump Media recorded revenue of just $770,500 in the first quarter, the second-straight quarter of sub-$1 million revenue. Not only that, but Truth Social remains a tiny player in social media, dwarfed by Elon Musk\u2019s X (formerly Twitter), Reddit and even Instagram\u2019s Threads. \u201cThis is a development-stage company with a multi-billion-dollar valuation,\u201d said Matthew Kennedy, senior IPO market strategist at Renaissance Capital. That\u2019s why some experts have dismissed Trump Media as a meme stock similar to GameStop and AMC that trades on momentum and hype, not fundamentals. \u201cWhen a company\u2019s stock drops significantly, you typically start to see value investors take interest, but that\u2019s not the case with meme stocks,\u201d said Kennedy. Trump Media was already having a bad June, and then it got even worse when the company announced the Securities and Exchange Commission approved its registration statement. The green light from regulators clears the way for early investors to exercise warrants they hold in the company to buy more shares. The move was long-expected, and it could raise nearly $250 million for Trump Media \u2014 cash the company can use to build its nascent ad platform or buy a smaller firm. \u201cToday marks another milestone for Truth Social,\u201d Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes said in a statement on Tuesday. \u201cWith our S-1 declared effective, we\u2019re expecting to be well positioned to energetically pursue TV streaming, other enhancements to the platform, and potential mergers and acquisitions.\u201d However, the exercising of the warrants will also likely dilute the holdings of existing shareholders by dramatically increasing the supply of shares outstanding in the company. Trump Media can issue 21.5 million additional shares. \u201cThe price of these meme stocks is determined by supply and demand \u2013 something that is true for any stock but more so for when a stock is trading so far above its fundamental value,\u201d said Ritter, the finance professor. Trump is the dominant shareholder in the company, owning 114.75 million shares, or nearly 65%. His stake was bumped up in late April when a bonus, known as earnout shares, was triggered by the company\u2019s share price staying above certain levels. Trump\u2019s stake, which can\u2019t be sold in the near-term, is now valued at about $3.1 billion. That\u2019s down from $6 billion as recently as May 30.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/business/trump-media-stock-truth-social-djt/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/23/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_20_success_interest-rates-savings-cash", "text": "The Federal Reserve\u2019s benchmark interest rate remains at a 23-year high. That\u2019s thanks to the central bank\u2019s decision Wednesday to once again hold it steady, as it has done at the policy-making committee\u2019s past five meetings. That decision may be disappointing to some investors, homebuyers and those with a lot of credit card debt, since movement in the Fed\u2019s overnight lending rate influences rates \u2014 directly or indirectly \u2014 on consumer financial products (e.g., credit cards, bank loans and mortgages). But\u00a0with the Fed signaling that no rate cuts are likely until summer, it also means anyone with savings still has at least a few more months to make hay of their stash. That\u2019s because you can still get inflation-beating interest rates that will grow any money you have set aside for emergencies, vacations, down payments or any other goal in your sights over the next several years. However, that won\u2019t happen if you just let it sit in a traditional checking or savings account that yields next to nothing. There are more lucrative, low-risk options out there, with rates that are still at or near their peaks. \u201cBut perhaps not for much longer,\u201d said Ted Rossman, senior analyst at Bankrate. \u201cIf one of those fits into your financial plans, it\u2019s best to act soon.\u201d So, consider the following options when deciding where to park your hard-earned savings. High-yield online savings accounts The average annual percentage yield on bank savings accounts was just 0.52% as of March 13, according to Bankrate. That average is kept low by the biggest brick-and-mortar banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, which still are offering a paltry 0.01%. By contrast, there are still FDIC-insured online banks offering inflation-beating rates of between 4.35% and 5.35% on their high-yield savings accounts. Generally speaking, these are the best vehicles in which to keep your emergency funds for quick, easy access. Choosing between an account that pays 0.52% and one that pays 5.35% can mean forfeiting hundreds of dollars in interest. \u201cIf you put $10,000 in a savings account, that\u2019s a difference of $496 in interest earnings over the course of the year, assuming monthly compounding,\u201d Rossman said. While the rates on high-yield savings accounts have gone down a bit in recent months, \u201cwidespread cuts in online savings account rates are unlikely until the first Fed rate cut is near,\u201d said Ken Tumin, founder of DepositAccounts.com. As with any bank savings rate, high-yield savings account\u00a0rates\u00a0can change overnight, and the bank may not alert you when it lowers it. So make sure to check your monthly statement. Certificates of deposits Another high-return, low-risk investment that is great for money you likely won\u2019t need to tap for a few months or even a couple of years is a certificate of deposit. You can get the best returns on CDs through a brokerage such as Schwab, E*Trade or Fidelity. That\u2019s because you can comparison shop for CDs from any number of FDIC-insured banks and will not have to set up individual accounts with each institution. As of March 13, the average rate on a one-year CD was 1.95%, but some banks are offering as much are 5.4%. If you can get a one-year CD at, say, 5.4%, you will make $540 on a $10,000 investment. To get the greatest benefit from a CD, you have to leave the money invested for a fixed period. You can always access your principal sooner if you need to, but there may be early withdrawal penalties. As of March 20, CDs listed on Schwab.com with durations from three months up to three years were all yielding between 5.2% and 5.51%. CD rates on durations between four and 10 years ranged from 4.40% to 5.15%. Say you invest $10,000 in a one-year CD with a 5.36%\u00a0APY. At the end of that period, you\u2019d get your principal back plus $536 in interest when the CD matures, according to Bankrate\u2019s CD calculator. If you chose a two-year CD at 5.25%, you\u2019d bank an extra $1,078, assuming compounding interest. The same investment in a five-year CD at 5.15% would earn $2,854. \u201cIt makes sense to go long with CDs. To hedge your bets, include terms from one to five years. Starting a CD ladder will provide this mix,\u201d Tumin said. If you don\u2019t go through a brokerage you may get a reasonable deal from your primary bank, Tumin said. For example, he noted, Wells Fargo is still offering up to 5.01% on both 4-month and 7-month CDs. Or, at Bank of America, you can get up to 4.75% on a 7-month CD. But Tumin cautions that with any big bank CD you should take your money out at the end of the term, otherwise your bank may automatically renew it and lock you in to a much lower-yielding CD. Money market accounts and funds If you don\u2019t want to set up an online savings account at another bank, your own bank may offer you a money market deposit account that pays a higher yield than your regular checking or savings accounts. Money market accounts may have higher minimum deposit requirements than a regular savings account, but they are more liquid than a fixed-term certificate of deposit or Treasury bill, meaning they give you access to your money more quickly while still potentially giving you some of the highest yields available, said Doug Ornstein, senior manager for integrated solutions at TIAA Wealth Management. But don\u2019t confuse money market accounts with money market mutual funds, which invest in short-term, low-risk debt instruments. As of March 19, they had an average 7-day yield of 5.14%, according to the Crane Money Fund Index, which tracks the top 100 taxable money market funds. Unlike money market deposit accounts, money market mutual funds are not insured by the FDIC. But if you invest in a money market fund through a brokerage, your overall account is likely to be insured through the Securities Investor Protection Corp, which offers protection in the event your brokerage ever goes under. Treasury bills and notes Another option for money you can leave untouched anywhere from several months to a few years is to buy short-term Treasury bills and medium-term notes, which are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. Three- and six-month bills had yields of 5.39% and 5.33%\u00a0respectively on March 20 before the Fed\u2019s meeting ended, while nine-month and one-year bills were offering 5.19% and 5.08%\u00a0respectively, according to rates posted on Schwab.com for a $25,000 investment. Rates on Treasury notes with durations from two years to 10 years ranged between 4.29% and 4.72%. If you\u2019re someone who manages your portfolio like a hawk, you may feel comfortable buying T-bills on your own from TreasuryDirect.gov. But if you don\u2019t, it might be easier just to buy new issues through your brokerage account or invest in a short-term bond index fund or ETF, said Andy Smith, executive director of financial planning at Edelman Financial Engines. And if you\u2019re looking at money that will be needed in three to five years, you might consider a diversified fund of highly rated government and corporate bonds, Ornstein said. An 18-month AAA-rated corporate bond, for instance, was yielding 4.82% this week, while the three-year was at 4.49%. Meanwhile, three-year AAA-rated municipal bonds (which are issued by local governments) had a rate of 3.98%, according to Schwab.com. Don\u2019t chase yield When deciding on the best accounts and investments for your specific goals and peace of mind, it may pay to consult a fee-only fiduciary adviser \u2014 meaning, someone who doesn\u2019t get paid a commission to sell you a particular investment. What you\u2019ll always want to do is build in flexibility for yourself so you can easily access cash, regardless of your timeline for key goals. \u201cWhat happens if something changes and you need that down payment a lot sooner \u2014 or your parents need medical care fast?\u201d Smith said. That means balancing your desire for great yield with a need and desire for ease of access without penalty. Translation: Don\u2019t chase yield for yield\u2019s sake. Think of it this way, Ornstein said: Unless you have huge sums to invest or are an institutional investor, the difference between getting a 5.1% yield versus 5% is negligible, and in fact it could even cost you more if there are penalties for taking your money out early. \u201cMost of the time convenience is really important. Give up the 0.1%,\u201d he advised.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/20/success/interest-rates-savings-cash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/23/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_22_business_malls-lack-windows-curious-consumer", "text": "Decades ago, Americans flocked to Main Street to shop. A string of small family-owned stores stood next to each other along a tree-lined block or two, displaying their goods through large welcoming windows. Then in 1956 something happened that forever changed that shopping experience. A new retailing format packed up the hustle and bustle of Main Street commerce and recreated it inside of a very large boxy building that was \u2013 deliberately \u2013 devoid of windows. The birth of the American mall ushered in an era of \u201cwindowless\u201d shopping that\u2019s largely still here. The strategy was clever and little details in the planning \u2013- from the no-frills shoebox architecture to potted plants \u2013 were carefully thought out. These were cost-saving measures for mall operators that were also designed to influence mallgoers to spend freely. The unnaturally bright artificial lighting strived to create a perpetual daytime environment. This way, mall visitors would stay longer than they had expected to and spent more than they would have wanted to. Another reason for malls shunning windows did have something to do with the merchandising, Burt Flickinger, retail expert and managing director of retail consultancy Strategic Resource Group told CNN. Fewer windows and more walls, he said, meant more space for retailers to add shelves and rods to stock their products and maximize sales per square foot in their stores that would otherwise be lost to a dull view of a mall parking lot. But the sneakiest reason why malls limit windows could be to make shoppers lose track of time. \u201cShoppers can\u2019t see the rain storm or snow storm blowing in without windows. Windowless shopping creates an environment of consumption without distractions,\u201d Flickinger said. \u201cWhen people have a sense of timelessness and comfort, families spend more because they can focus just on the stores and the mall experience.\u201d Shock-and-awe on the inside The first fully enclosed mall \u2013 the Southdale Center in Minneapolis \u2013 opened in 1956. It became the prototype going forward as indoor climate-controlled malls that could stay open year-round popped up in suburbs across the country. The architect of the 1.2 million square feet Southdale Center was Austria-born Victor Gruen, considered the pioneer of modern mall design. He established Gruen Associates, a legacy architecture, planning and landscape firm still in existence and based in Los Angeles. He wanted to wow shoppers with shock-and-awe once they entered the building and took in the brightly-lit shops and cafes, even artwork exhibited around the mall. At the center of the mall layout would be a fountain or a skylight, possibly the only entry point to natural light coming into the expansive space. He added plants and music to create an inviting sensory experience. The structure of the traditional mall was either a T-shape, or a cross shape with the four anchor stores on either sides, Stephanie Cegielski, vice president of research with the International Council of Shopping Centers, told CNN. \u201cWhen you are walking around that \u2018T\u2019 everything is facing into you. As a shopper, you are perpetually looking at what is coming next and opposed to what\u2019s going on in the outside world,\u201d she said. Because all of the activity faced in, Cegielski said it didn\u2019t make sense for there to be windows per se, \u201cunless you were looking at a department store that has its own separate entrance into the mall that would create that window to the outside,\u201d she said. The exterior look was another story. The Southdale mall was functional and drab to look at and that is the blueprint that all traditional enclosed malls have continued to follow. \u201cMalls are really built to have the landscape on the inside. All of the architectural energy that we normally see on the outside of a building in an urban setting is focused internally. A mall is a machine for selling,\u201d Alexandra Lange, an architecture critic and author of \u201cMeet me by the fountain: An inside history of the mall\u201d said in an interview with CNN. The first round of malls in the mid-to-late 1950s did have more architecture on the outside, Lange said. \u201cBut the mall owners found that there was no increase in consumer interest based on that so let\u2019s  not waste money on that,\u201d she said. Fewer windows means lower energy bill As an added bonus, \u201cit was a lot less expensive for mall developers to not put multiple windows facing on the outside because it would make it cheaper to heat and cool the big-box space,\u201d said Thomas McMillan, director with the Center of Retailing Studies at Texas A&M University\u2019s Mays Business School, in an interview with CNN. Energy costs typically are the second-highest operating expense for retailers after labor costs. \u201cThe sophistication of double-pane energy-efficient windows wasn\u2019t ubiquitous when a lot of the malls were built in America during and after the 1970s energy crisis. So air conditioning could seep through the window panes,\u201d said Flickinger. The mall design inspired another type of store. Other shopping destinations that incorporate a windowless boxy venue are supermarkets. \u201cA typical grocery store layout has all of the fresh food around the outside that tends to be refrigerated. It\u2019s good for it to be next to a wall where there is power,\u201d Lange said. \u201cIf you cut windows into the wall, you have less space for refrigerated cases.\u201d Today, there are about 1,122 enclosed malls in the US, according to the International Council of Shopping Centers. That\u2019s down from around 1,400 regional malls that existed around 15 years ago, according to Kristin Mueller, president, retail property management with\u00a0JLL, a real estate and investment management services firm, in an interview with CNN. But even with fewer enclosed malls in existence today, and just a handful of new malls built over the last decade (including the 3 million square foot American Dream Mall which opened in East Rutherford, New Jersey in 2019) that still abide by Gruen\u2019s blueprint, shoppers, especially Gen Z and Millennials, don\u2019t appear to be put off by their windowless aesthetic, she said. On average, 54% of US adult shoppers have visited a mall at least once a month in 2023 and spent an average of a little more than $300 each month last year, according to the latest data from the ICSC. As many as 70% of those shoppers were GenZers and 66% of them Millennials, according to the group. Mall retailing is evolving, however, said Cegielski. Families head to malls for entertainment as much as shopping, with people enjoying restaurants, movies, mini golf, pickleball courts and large indoor amusement centers that have been retrofitted inside of existing shopping centers. Some of these adaptive uses of traditional malls might be creating a practical need for windows after all, she said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/22/business/malls-lack-windows-curious-consumer/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/23/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_19_success_wall-street-bonuses", "text": "Last year wasn\u2019t the most lucrative for Wall Street bankers, but their bonus payouts still easily trounced US median household income. The average Wall Street bonus for 2023 was $176,500, according to estimates that will be released Tuesday morning by New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli. That\u2019s down 2% from the $180,000 recorded in 2022. Both those averages were well below the $240,000 paid out in 2021. That the average bonus was slightly down isn\u2019t surprising. Wall Street earnings last year were mixed, and merger and acquisition activity was underwhelming. \u201cWall Street\u2019s profits were up 1.8% in 2023, but firms have taken a more cautious approach to compensation and more employees have joined the securities industry, which accounts for the slight decline in the average bonus,\u201d DiNapoli said in a statement. Nevertheless, a little perspective: The average Wall Street bonus, which comes on top of the nearly half-a-million-dollar average Wall Street salary, was itself almost 2.5 times higher than the median US household income of $74,580, according to Census data for 2022. Wall Street bonuses and general employment in the securities industry provide vital revenue streams for the New York State and New York City economies, accounting most recently for 27% of the state\u2019s tax collections and 7% of city tax revenue, according to DiNapoli\u2019s office. The securities industry \ufeffin the city employed roughly 198,500 people last year, up from 191,600 the year before. And DiNapoli estimates that 1 in 11 of the city\u2019s jobs are either directly or indirectly associated with the industry. The total estimated bonus pool for 2023 was\u00a0slightly lower than the year before and is\u00a0projected to bring in $4 million less in state income tax revenue and $2 million less for the city revenue than bonuses in 2022 did. Still, DiNapoli noted, \u201cWhile these bonuses affect income tax revenues for the state and city, both budgeted for larger declines so the impact on projected revenues should be limited.\u201d It should be noted that the comptroller\u2019s numbers only reflect the bonuses paid to securities industry employees working for firms based in New York City. Beyond bringing in tax revenue for government coffers, Wall Street workers contribute substantially to the local Gotham economy. DiNapoli said that more employees in financial services (65%) are working in-office on any given day compared to 58% working in other industries in the city, at least as of September 2023. And that securities industry employees use the subway more than other workers in the city. All in, he estimates that Wall Street is responsible for roughly 14% of economic activity in the city. As critical as that is, the city and state are about much more than just Wall Street. \u201cThe securities industry\u2019s continued strength should not overshadow the broader economic picture in New York, where we need all sectors to enjoy full recovery from the pandemic,\u201d DiNapoli said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/19/success/wall-street-bonuses/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/23/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit", "text": "When Apple launched its first Mac computer in 1984, with its iconic Mac smiley-face \u201chello\u201d greeting, it wanted to differentiate itself in the fledgling PC market. The Mac was approachable with its friendly, innovative design \u2013 Apple\u2019s way of setting the Mac apart in the confusing PC landscape. That consumer-friendly mantra still exists today, with Apple carefully curating an easy-breezy yet controlled user experience across its products, including the billions of iPhones used around the world. But the Biden administration believes Apple took that too far. On Thursday, the Department of Justice sued Apple for illegally monopolizing the smartphone market. In a press conference, the government provided a long list of how Apple has allegedly squashed competition with restrictive app store terms, high fees and its \u201cwalled-garden\u201d approach, restricting how third-party companies interact with its brands and services. The company denied the lawsuit\u2019s allegations and said it plans to fight them. Apple added that the lawsuit could empower the government \u201cto take a heavy hand in designing people\u2019s technology.\u201d But if successful, the lawsuit could ripple across Apple\u2019s products and services. Although the suit could take years to play out, here\u2019s a closer look what it may eventually mean for iPhone users: Changes to the App Store If found liable, the company could be forced to change a number of things. One such change is how iPhone users could get greater access to \u201csuper apps\u201d that have been largely restricted before. The term refers to one-stop-shop apps that allow for messaging, ordering food, payment processing and other capabilities all within one platform.  According to Dipanjan Chatterjee, a principal analyst at market research firm Forrester, super apps most threaten Apple\u2019s preeminence in the lives of its customers. \u201cAn offering like WeChat, dubbed China\u2019s everything app, can provide an alternative to the Apple ecosystem for people to communicate, bank, share memories, talk to businesses and more,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cWhat Apple fears most is becoming irrelevant to its customers.\u201d At the same time, super apps like WeChat are created by larger companies and could, therefore, put some smaller companies at a disadvantage. And the concept hasn\u2019t been welcomed much in the US anyway. The US government, however, could argue that lack of interest may be due to Apple\u2019s high share of the smartphone market and its resistance to offer super apps in its store, Chatterjee said. Better interoperability Apple may also be required to offer more support for cross-platform messaging, an issue the company previously said it\u2019s already working on. The company lets iPhone users send high-quality photos and videos to one another, but similar texts to Android phones are slower and grainy. It also maintains those messages in green bubbles, creating a kind of class divide, critics argue. In November, the company said it will add new features, such as read receipts, typing indicators, better support for group chats and higher quality media sharing of images and videos, across platforms to help close the gap. Apple\u2019s move to add support for the standard called RCS (rich communication services) is intended to roll out later this year. RCS is considered the replacement to alternatives such as SMS, or short messaging service, and can work over both Wi-Fi and mobile data. The change followed pressure from both regulators and competitors to more seamlessly work across operating systems. The European Union\u2019s Digital Markets Act, for example, requires companies to make their key services interoperable between platforms. The US government could require the same. More open services Another likely change is how hardware from other companies, such as smartwatches, will interact with the Apple range of devices and software, including the iPhone and Apple\u2019s services like Fitness+. The company has also required Apple Watch users to own iOS devices as a way to keep them locked into its existing ecosystem. Chatterjee said making this change would have both positives and negatives. \u201cThe net result would reside somewhere along the spectrum of access to more and cheaper options but also the devaluation of the customer experience that is so highly prized by Apple\u2019s customers,\u201d he said. The Biden administration has also taken issue with Apple\u2019s lack of support for mobile cloud services. Loosening this could allow users to access games and other cloud-based apps without having to pay for pricey hardware. Inside the debate The DOJ lawsuit claims Apple\u2019s behavior has illegally hindered competition, kept its customers locked into its products and prevented other companies from innovating. Although the Biden administration will have to prove these harms, some critics say any potential changes Apple could make will negatively impact the user experience. David McQueen, a research director at ABI Research, said he recognizes that the content and applications market should be open, and Apple needs to avoid monopolistic advantages that can restrict competition, push up prices or block innovation. But Apple\u2019s success stems in part to its tight grip on its products and services, keeping things intuitive and seamless. \u201cIf Apple is forced to comply, it could potentially spell the end to the provision of this consistent and unified user experience, although by the same token, consumers will be open to a greater choice of apps and services, helping more developers and providers,\u201d McQueen said. Chatterjee noted some people are drawn to the Apple family of products precisely because of the carefully managed ecosystem\u2019s ease of use. Apple may have to work that much harder to preserve the integrity of its experience, but any changes probably won\u2019t be enough to make customers to leave and go elsewhere. \u201cThe vast majority of Apple customers would probably be happier with some more choice and lower prices as long as it did not hamper their levels of customer experience, which is threatened by the less control Apple has over the experience,\u201d Chatterjee said. But he added those currently outside of the Apple ecosystem will likely benefit by \u201cplugging in opportunistically without having to go all in with Apple.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/23/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_17_media_surgeon-general-social-media-apps-warning-label", "text": "Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy said the threat social media poses to children requires urgent action, and he demanded Congress to put a label on the apps as it does with cigarettes and alcohol. \u201cThe mental health crisis among young people is an emergency \u2014 and social media has emerged as an important contributor,\u201d Murthy said in an op-ed in the New York Times Monday. Murthy cited several studies, including a 2019 American Medical Association study published in JAMA that showed teens who spend three hours a day on social media double their risk of depression. Teens spend nearly five hours a day on social media apps, according to a Gallup poll. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Meg Tirrell, Murthy said that the prevalence of social media use among kids is over 95%, \u201cnearly universal.\u201d But Murthy cannot act unilaterally to put a warning label on apps \u2014 that requirement would have to come from Congress, with whom Murthy pleaded to pass a bill. \u201cI put forward this call for a warning because I think it\u2019s essential that parents know what we now know, which is that there are significant harms associated with social media use,\u201d Murthy told CNN. Similar labels on tobacco, first instituted in 1965, led to a steady decline in cigarette smoking in America over the past several decades. Congress has long chastised social media companies, claiming they pose harm to children. CEOs of tech companies have been grilled routinely on Capitol Hill, most notably Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg \u2014 who publicly apologized to families whose children killed themselves because of online bullying and harassment. But Congress has taken little action to curb children\u2019s social media usage. Murthy argued that it\u2019s time for Congress to get serious about curbing children\u2019s use of social media. \u201cUntil that point in time, when we have reliable evidence that tells us social media is safe and changes are being made and will be made in the future\u2026 parents deserve to be warned. That\u2019s where the label comes in,\u201d Murthy told CNN, adding that he hopes Congress will introduce legislation to add a surgeon general\u2019s warning label on social media as soon as possible. \u201cI think this is an urgent issue.\u201d An escalating battle Murthy has warned about social media\u2019s harm to children\u2019s welfare for years. But Monday\u2019s declaration of an emergency and his appeal to Congress represent his most urgent call to action on the issue so far. In May 2023, Murthy issued an advisory that said there\u2019s not enough evidence to determine whether social media is safe enough for children and adolescents\u2019 mental health, saying social media use presents \u201ca profound risk of harm\u201d for kids. He suggested parents restrict their kids\u2019 social media use, saying 13 is too young to join social apps. But such advisories are designed to call attention to urgent public health \u2013 they don\u2019t require action. \u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of a youth mental health crisis, and I\u2019m concerned that social media is contributing to the harm that kids are experiencing,\u201d Murthy told CNN in May 2023. \u201cFor too long, we have placed the entire burden of managing social media on the shoulders of parents and kids, despite the fact that these platforms are designed by some of the most talented engineers and designers in the world to maximize the amount of time that our kids spend on them.\u201d On CNN\u2019s \u201cChasing Life\u201d podcast with Dr. Sanjay Gupta in June 2023, Murthy outlined some steps parents can take to rein in their children\u2019s social media usage, including partnering with other parents to make sure kids lack the \u201cI\u2019m the only one without social media\u201d excuse. More action needed A warning label, if Congress passes legislation requiring one, would be insufficient to fix the problem, Murthy acknowledged. He suggested schools become phone-free environments for children, as should dinner time and other family events. And Murthy urged parents to restrict children\u2019s use of social media until they graduate from middle school. Several states have worked to pass legislation to increase the age at which children can begin to use social apps or some of their more time-sucking features, such as algorithms that push people to engage with more content within the app. The bills have been largely bipartisan. Florida\u2019s Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in March signed a bill that would prohibit children under 14 from obtaining their own social media accounts, and children under 16 would need parental consent to have accounts. New York Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul said she would sign legislation passed by the state legislature that would ban social media from using algorithms in children\u2019s feeds, and the bill would also prevent tech companies from sharing information of children under 18. \u201cThis is much easier said than done, which is why parents should work together with other families to establish shared rules, so no parents have to struggle alone or feel guilty when their teens say they are the only one who has to endure limits,\u201d Murthy wrote in the New York Times. On Monday, Murthy confirmed to CNN that alcohol and cigarettes are currently the only two products with surgeon general warning labels but that the overall health risk of social media is \u201cjust as profound.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re talking about the mental health and wellbeing of kids,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/media/surgeon-general-social-media-apps-warning-label/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/23/2024", "section": "business"}}

The fast food giant says it\u2019s still working on AI-related solutions at a time when its rivals are making similar investments.

But the company suggested it will look at AI partners other than IBM. McDonald\u2019s and IBM launched their partnership in 2021, announcing the development of Automated Order Taking (AOT) technology to create a more convenient and simplified ordering experience for its customers and restaurant teams as a part of its \u201cAccelerating the Arches\u201d growth plan.

After dozens of reports of lacerations from exposed blades, Vitamix announced a recall of about 569,000 blending containers and blade bases for its high-powered blenders. It expands on an extensive recall already issued in 2018 for some of the most expensive and well-known blenders on the market. The recall said that the container can separate from the blade base and can expose the blades. Twenty-seven people have reported lacerations to Vitamix, which includes 11 reports from a 2018 recall that affected more than 100,000 units. Vitamix is not offering replacements or a refund. All affected customers should immediately stop using the recalled parts, the company said, and contact Vitamix for a repair kit. The repair kit includes a protective plastic shroud to put over the blade base as well as additional instructions. The company said it worked with Health Canada and the US Consumer Product Safety Commission to evaluate the potential remedies, and all three agreed on the repair kit. \u201cVitamix\u2019s top priority is the safety of its customers. To ensure Vitamix has a well-built product, Vitamix products undergo extensive testing, leveraging the 130+ test procedures in Vitamix\u2019s catalog to assess every component for quality and durability,\u201d Vitamix said in a statement. Vitamix instructed customers who repaired their blenders in the 2018 recall to stop using those blender parts as well. The recall affects all Ascent and Venturist Series 8-ounce blending containers, 20-ounce blending containers, and blade bases. Faulty blade bases and blending containers may have been sold separately, according to the recall posted on the CPSC website. \u201cThe clear containers and black blade bases are included with certain Vitamix Venturist and Ascent Series blenders, such as the Venturist V1200, Ascent A2300, Ascent A2500, Ascent A3300, and Ascent A3500 blenders; and also sold separately, as sets, or bundles in various configurations,\u201d the recall said. Ascent blenders can retail for up to $749.95 and the Venturist V1200 can retail for up to $549.95 on the Vitamix website. The bundles cost even more and add to the base price, bringing the total to nearly $1,000. The pricey blenders were sold at Costco, Best Buy, Crate & Barrel, Macy\u2019s, Target, Williams Sonoma, Walmart and specialty stores from April 2017 through May 2024. Amazon, Vitamix and QVC also sold the products online.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/business/vitamix-recalls-blender-parts/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/23/2024", "section": "business"}}

The company, owned by Europe\u2019s richest man Bernard Arnault, said Thursday that it had bought a majority stake in Chez L\u2019ami Louis, a 100-year-old restaurant in central Paris, described by LVMH as an \u201cauthentic Parisian gem.\u201d \u201cLVMH will work to preserve the unique character and family identity of the restaurant and continue to support its French savoir-faire and expertise,\u201d it said in a press release. It did not disclose the size of its stake nor the value of the deal. The classic bistro \u2014 famed for its roast chicken, mounds of thin, crispy fries, and plates of sizzling snails \u2014 has hosted Bill Clinton and Martin Scorsese, as well as David and Victoria Beckham, according to a source familiar with the deal. The source requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter. If that wasn\u2019t endorsement enough, the restaurant has also earned Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s seal of approval. Her lifestyle company Goop describes Chez L\u2019ami Louis on its website as \u201cone of the best, most venerable bistros in Paris.\u201d \u201cIt is small and wood-paneled, with an ancient oven and a sick wine list,\u201d Goop gushed. LVMH said in its press release that the bistro sources its produce from small breeders and market gardeners \u201cwho have been loyal to the restaurant for several generations.\u201d CNN could not reach Chez L\u2019ami Louis for comment Friday. The essence of Paris Arnault has also dined at the Parisian restaurant, the source close to the deal told CNN, adding that the billionaire is passionate about preserving parts of the city\u2019s cultural \u201cidentity and expression.\u201d LVMH and Arnault pledged \u20ac200 million ($226 million) in 2019 to help rebuild Notre Dame after fire devastated the 850-year-old church. The families behind L\u2019Oreal\u00a0(LRLCF) and Kering also made big donations. There is a risk, the source added, that when the historical owners of culturally important venues such as Chez L\u2019ami Louis move on, new investors swoop in and transform them \u201cinto something that is very far from (the original) identity.\u201d Arnault, the world\u2019s third-richest man after Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk, is worth an estimated $199 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. In recent years, LVMH, which owns Dior and Louis Vuitton among other designer brands, has beefed up its portfolio of hospitality venues. In 2019, the company acquired Belmond, which owns hotels and organizes luxury rail and river cruises, in a $3.2 billion deal.

{"id": "2024_03_22_media_ronna-mcdaniel-nbc", "text": "NBC News on Friday announced that it had hired Ronna McDaniel, the former Republican National Committee chair who has repeatedly\u00a0attacked the network and its journalists,\u00a0assailed the\u00a0news\u00a0media as \u201cfake news\u201d and promoted false claims around the 2020\u00a0vote,\u00a0as an on-air commentator\u00a0ahead of the 2024 presidential election. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be a more important moment to have a voice like Ronna\u2019s on the team,\u201d Carrie Budoff Brown, senior vice president of politics at NBC News, said in a memo\u00a0to staff. McDaniel exited the RNC earlier this month after leading the organization since 2016. During her time as chair, McDaniel repeatedly attacked the press, which has become increasingly popular in Republican circles over the last several years as Donald Trump demonizes journalists and news institutions. McDaniel echoed many such attacks, labeling the press as \u201cfake news\u201d and calling the media \u201ccorrupt.\u201d At times, she even targeted NBC News\u00a0and MSNBC\u00a0with dishonest attacks. In 2019, for instance, McDaniel accused Richard Engel, NBC News\u2019 chief foreign correspondent, of \u201cactively cheering for an economic downturn.\u201d \u201cHow can NBC let him keep his job when he\u2019s made his bias so clear?\u201d McDaniel asked. McDaniel has a lengthier history attacking the progressive cable news channel MSNBC, which she will appear on in her new role. In recent years, she has repeatedly attacked the channel for \u201cspreading lies\u201d and blasted those she described as the network\u2019s \u201cprimetime propagandists.\u201d An NBC spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment about her attacks on the news media and NBC. In her role as RNC chief, McDaniel also fanned the flames of election denialism after the 2020 presidential contest. McDaniel was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d The Michigan Department of State\u2019s office condemned her claims of supposed voter fraud in the wake of the election, stating they had \u201cno merit.\u201d\u00a0The state\u2019s \u201celections were conducted fairly, effectively and transparently and are an accurate reflection of the will of Michigan voters,\u201d it said in a\u00a0detailed fact check\u00a0posted online. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Chris Wallace last year, McDaniel defended her claims of voting \u201cirregularity\u201d in the election. \u201cI think saying that there were problems with 2020 is very real. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s election denying,\u201d McDaniel told Wallace. \u201cI\u2019m from Wayne County. We had a woman send a note saying I\u2019m being told to backdate ballots. We had to look into that. That\u2019s deeply concerning. When you have friends who are poll-watching and being kicked out, that\u2019s deeply concerning. We have every right to look at that.\u201d In the interview,\u00a0Wallace pressed McDaniel if she believed Biden legitimately won the election. \u201cI think there were lots of problems with 2020. Ultimately, he won the election\u00a0but there were lots of problems with the 2020 election,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think he won it fair. I don\u2019t. I\u2019m not going to say that.\u201d NBC\u2019s hiring of McDaniel, however, plays into a recent trend at the\u00a0network\u2019s outlets, which has seemingly softened its stance on Trump as he inches toward the Republican nomination for president. Earlier this month, CNBC hosted Trump for a lengthy phone interview in which the network\u2019s anchors allowed him to peddle lies and conspiracy theories on air\u00a0without scrutiny. MSNBC has even started carrying Trump\u2019s remarks live on television, a practice that the network boasted for years it would not do. Star host Rachel Maddow, who has said carrying Trump\u2019s lies\u00a0on the air\u00a0is dangerous, even objected to the network broadcasting a recent speech from the presumptive Republican nominee, calling it \u201cirresponsible.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/22/media/ronna-mcdaniel-nbc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/23/2024", "section": "business"}}

The shareholder lawsuit accused the apparel maker and CEO\u00a0Kevin Plank\u00a0of intentionally misleading them about the company\u2019s financial health.

You can sign up\u00a0right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link. Nvidia\u2019s eye-popping gains this year have helped propel the stock market to repeated record highs. But beneath the surface, the rally is looking uneven. The S&P 500 index has jumped nearly 15% so far in 2024, notching 31 new peaks along the way. Much of those returns have been driven by the mega-cap Magnificent Seven stocks, which have seen explosive growth as investors pour cash into the burgeoning artificial intelligence boom. But beyond that cohort of tech stocks, the market is looking less rosy. The S&P 500 equal-weighted index, which gives every stock the same weighting, has risen just 4% this year. The information technology and communication services sectors of the benchmark index have gained roughly 29% and 24%, respectively. The S&P 500\u2019s other sectors have notched single-digit gains, excluding real estate, which is lower for the year. At the forefront of the market\u2019s meteoric returns is Nvidia. The company briefly surpassed Microsoft this week as the largest public company the world. Nvidia shares are up 164% for the year. The chipmaker\u2019s stock has been on a tear for the last year and a half. Nvidia\u2019s chips are unmatched in producing processors that power artificial intelligence systems, including for generative AI, the technology backing OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, which can create text, images and other media. Can Nvidia\u2019s blockbuster gains continue, and what does its outsized market cap mean for the stock rally? Before the Bell spoke with Christopher Barto, senior investment analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Before the Bell: Are you worried that the stock market\u2019s gains aren\u2019t even across the board, and most of it is concentrated in the big tech Magnificent Seven stocks, especially Nvidia? I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s necessarily worrisome. I think it\u2019s interesting. Coming out of first-quarter earnings, when you exclude the (Magnificent Seven earnings) numbers, growth was actually down 2% year-over-year. So, the majority of the market is struggling. There are some bright spots. There are a lot of other semiconductor equipment companies, and there are other companies that are doing well that just aren\u2019t at the market-cap weight that Nvidia is at, and we sort of look at those as presenting opportunities (to buy.) Do you think investors are being too reliant on Nvidia and optimism that its stock will continue to climb? We could kind of circle back to Apple a year or two ago. They were the largest company in the world. And every single day, it was, \u201coh, the market depends on Apple.\u201d And then you see the shift a year and a half later, maybe even less than a year, to Nvidia. Now everyone says, \u201cthe market is dependent on Nvidia\u2019s earnings.\u201d You\u2019re going to see a kind of a shift in market cap over the years. You see the shift in market-cap weighted indices over time, and it\u2019s driven especially by their economic profit. So, in terms of, should investors worry that Nvidia is becoming concentrated? I don\u2019t believe so. Do you think Nvidia\u2019s monster run will continue? I do not have the answer to that. But I do think that if you want exposure to artificial intelligence and secular mega trends that you\u2019re seeing, you\u2019re going to want to own some of the mega-cap companies like the Googles and the Amazons and the Microsofts and the Metas, because if they\u2019re the ones that are spending on the (graphics processing units that Nvidia makes) and the servers and all the data centers, they have the ability to essentially pull that capital spending at any second to increase their free cash flow. (Much) of Nvidia\u2019s revenue is coming from Meta, it\u2019s coming from Google, it\u2019s coming from Amazon. You\u2019re seeing this shift in these companies trying to basically get ahead of AI demand, and those are the kinds of companies that could essentially afford Nvidia\u2019s GPUs at scale like that. Mortgage rates fall to their lowest level in almost three months Mortgage rates fell this week to their lowest level since early April, taking some pressure off America\u2019s unaffordable housing market, reports my colleague Bryan Mena. The standard 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 6.87% in the week ending June 20, mortgage financing giant Freddie Mac reported Thursday. That\u2019s down from last week\u2019s 6.95% average and marks the third consecutive weekly decline. Rates are down from a 2024 peak of 7.22%. \u201cMortgage rates fell for the third straight week following signs of cooling inflation and market expectations of a future Federal Reserve rate cut,\u201d said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac\u2019s chief economist, in a release. \u201cThese lower mortgage rates coupled with the gradually improving housing supply bodes well for the housing market.\u201d Still, mortgage rates remain higher than anything seen in the decade before 2022, the year the Federal Reserve began to raise interest rates to combat inflation. Borrowing costs are poised to ease this year, but it may not be by much. Earlier this month, Fed officials penciled in just one interest rate cut for this year, compared to the three they forecast in March. The Fed doesn\u2019t directly set mortgage rates but its actions do influence them through the benchmark 10-year US Treasury yield, which moves in anticipation of the Fed\u2019s policy moves. Economists don\u2019t expect the average mortgage rate to fall below 6% this year. Read more here. He tried to oust OpenAI\u2019s CEO. Now, he\u2019s starting a \u2018safe\u2019 rival The OpenAI co-founder who left the high-flying artificial intelligence startup last month has announced his next venture: a company dedicated to building safe, powerful artificial intelligence that could become a rival to his old employer. Ilya Sutskever announced plans for the new company, aptly named Safe Superintelligence Inc., in a post on X Wednesday, reports my colleague Clare Duffy. \u201cSSI is our mission, our name, and our entire product roadmap, because it is our sole focus. Our team, investors, and business model are all aligned to achieve SSI,\u201d a statement posted to the company\u2019s website reads. \u201cWe plan to advance capabilities as fast as possible while making sure our safety always remains ahead. This way, we can scale in peace.\u201d The announcement comes amid growing concerns in the tech world and beyond that AI may be advancing more quickly than research on using the technology safely and responsibly, as well as a dearth of regulation that has left tech companies largely free to set safety guidelines for themselves. Sutskever is considered one of the early pioneers of the AI revolution. As a student, he worked in a machine learning lab under Geoffrey Hinton, known as the \u201cGodfather of AI,\u201d where they created an AI startup that was later acquired by Google. Sutskever then worked on Google\u2019s AI research team, before helping to found what would become the maker of ChatGPT.

{"id": "2024_06_21_business_summer-fridays-hybrid-work", "text": "Happy day-after-summer-solstice. With any luck, if your employer has instituted a Summer Fridays policy, you\u2019ll get to knock off work early or even take the whole day off. It\u2019s always been a popular perk \u2014 because who doesn\u2019t want to start their weekend early? However, the majority of employees may not even have that option. Only 13% of US employees, for instance, said their organizations had Summer Fridays, in a 2023 survey commissioned by consulting and research firm Gartner. Among US employers, a survey last year from HR consulting firm Mercer found that only 19% said they offered summer working hours, up from 15% in 2021. Nevertheless, some employees may have even better options today, thanks to the transformation of work culture spurred by the pandemic. With so many people forced to work from home for long stretches, employers had to quickly get accustomed to giving employees greater flexibility in how, when and where they get their work done. There is no way to say definitively whether more or fewer companies are offering Summer Friday options today than before Covid-19 hit. But Caitlin Duffy, senior director of Gartner\u2019s HR practice, said she wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Summer Fridays become less of a featured benefit from employers because flexible work has become so much more prevalent. Duffy noted, for instance, that she\u2019s seen increased interest among employers in learning about four-day work weeks, noting that various experiments have shown improvements in employee performance and engagement. \u201cOur clients are seeing all these benefits coming out of trials that intrigue them,\u201d she said. Indeed, a number of benefits that summer hours offer \u2014 such as more time to recharge and more flexibility to make family plans \u2014 may be available through other flexible options. The same 2023 Gartner survey found that 31% of US employees said they enjoy flexible work hours while 18% said they had the option of working four and a half days a week year-round and 10% said they have a four-day workweek. Still, Summer Fridays are likely to remain an attractive perk as part of an overall paid time off and work flexibility package, especially to those whose companies have insisted employees come into the office five days a week, said Rich Fuerstenberg, senior partner in Mercer\u2019s Health Practice. Flexibility is great, but so is taking vacation time If you\u2019re working for an employer that doesn\u2019t offer Summer Fridays, or you just generally feel that you don\u2019t have all the flexibility you would like, at the very least take all the vacation days you\u2019ve accrued. Too few US workers do. Last year, The Pew Research Center found that 46% of US workers did not take all the paid time off that their employer allowed. And when you don\u2019t take your days, you\u2019re cheating yourself of the physical rest and mental break you know you need \u2014 and which studies suggest can make you a better employee in the long run. So, for your own sake (and, of course, that of your company), take the time off you\u2019ve earned. And have a very good weekend.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/business/summer-fridays-hybrid-work/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/23/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_21_business_fertility-clinic-ivf-religious-groups", "text": "Since February, when Alabama\u2019s Supreme Court declared frozen embryos are legally considered children, fertility clinics around the country have been weighing the implications of a political movement that\u2019s suddenly turned hostile toward IVF. Although Alabama has since passed legislation to protect in vitro fertilization, the ruling seemed to open a new front in the far-right\u2019s attacks on reproductive freedom. It could also threaten growth in the booming IVF market, which last year brought in an estimated $8 billion in revenue. Last month, Progyny, the nation\u2019s only publicly traded fertility benefits company, saw its shares sink to a two-year low after it warned that the ruling was scaring off potential customers. IVF also took center stage last week at the Southern Baptist Convention, where church leaders effectively condemned the practice. Nightcap sat down with Gina Bartasi, who founded Progyny in 2015, to discuss her latest project, Kindbody, a national fertility clinic network she launched in 2018 that now boasts 35 clinics around the country. The following interview has been edited for length and clarity.\u00a0 Nightcap: Earlier this month, you came back into the CEO role at Kindbody after two years as chair. Why now? Bartasi: There\u2019s a lot of enthusiasm around our clinics right now \u2014 I\u2019m pretty pumped. The company is tracking towards revenue of $225 to $250 million, which is an extraordinary milestone for a company as young as Kindbody \u2014 it\u2019s only a little over five years old. The other critical milestone is that we\u2019re profitable. We were profitable for consecutive months in March, April and May. Nightcap: It\u2019s also a particularly fraught time for reproductive rights in America. How has the Alabama decision, or even the Southern Baptists\u2019 statement last week, affected your work? Bartasi: We always say, the last person you ever want to make angry is an infertility patient. They will lock arms and really unite, and we\u2019re honored to be a part of that community. I have never seen any religious or government guardrail ever stop fertility patients. I\u2019m a former fertility patient, and no one was going to tell me no \u2014 I was going to do whatever it took to have the family I always dreamed about. And 99.9% of our patients support that same philosophy. I know Progyny reported some softening of utilization, but Kindbody actually saw a close to 22% increase in IVF utilization in the month after the Alabama ruling came out. Nightcap: Can you explain your business model a little bit? Where\u2019s your revenue coming from? And who are you partnering with? Bartasi: We have three revenue channels. We started in the direct-to-consumer model to really democratize care and build a global brand. Today, one in five couples needs fertility treatment to build their family. That\u2019s up significantly from one in eight in just the last decade. So the direct consumer business remains a big part of our business. Another is self-insured employers \u2014 they pay their own medical claims, and as such they want to remove the middleman. And particularly in a high-cost, niche industry like fertility, they want to be able to purchase services directly from a network of high-quality fertility doctors. Then our third vertical is called MCOs \u2014 managed care organizations. We are in-network with United and Aetna and Cigna and many of the Blues. Nightcap: Kindbody has faced some criticism over its for-profit model. (Editor\u2019s note: Last year, a\u00a0Bloomberg investigation\u00a0detailed issues such as understaffed clinics, lost and mislabeled embryos, and inconsistent safety protocols. Kindbody has disputed the allegations, saying its average incident rate is comparable to other major US programs.)  Some say that the business model creates perverse incentives for doctors to upsell, and that can be especially complicated when it comes to fertility patients, who, almost by definition are desperate for help. How do you respond to that criticism? Bartasi: Thank you for allowing us to be on the record about the criticism. Listen, without the financial support of our growth-stage investors, we would not be able to democratize care. We would not be able to help 3.1 million Americans have fertility treatment that previously could not afford to have treatment. We are proud and unapologetic. We are as big as any other fertility networks in terms of revenue and size of clinics. But those networks took 25 to 30 years to build. You can\u2019t do it without venture capital, unless your mission is to serve as many patients as possible and in as short a time as possible. And we want to bring down the price. That historically was the challenge with IVF. In the last decade-plus, IVF was reserved for rich, white heterosexual couples on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. And if you weren\u2019t dual-income, no kids \u2014 good luck. This is a very mission-based company. And it starts fundamentally with the patient experience, how do we want to treat and serve patients that have historically been left out of the process. You can be mission-oriented and still take in financial sponsors to accelerate your mission. Nightcap: Speaking of accelerating the mission, what are your initial public offering plans?

{"id": "2024_06_22_business_alaska-airlines-labor-deal-flight-attendants", "text": "Alaska Airlines and its 7,000-member flight attendants union reached a tentative labor deal late Friday, concluding talks that lasted more than a year and a half. Terms of the deal have not been released, though the union called it a \u201crecord contract.\u201d The deal likely contains a significant pay raise, which has been a common demand across the airline industry and sought by unions whose members in some cases have not seen a pay increase in years. In April, the union announced to members it was seeking pay raises of between 43% to 56%, depending upon seniority, through 2026. Those pay raises would include back pay covering a period dating back a year and a half that they\u2019ve worked under the terms of the previous contract. \u201cYour actions over the last two years of bargaining \u2026 ensured we had the leverage to extract every last dollar from Alaska Airlines management,\u201d the union said Friday in a statement to its members. Alaska Airlines said it was pleased to have reached an agreement and thanked union negotiators. \u201cWith our combined efforts, we\u2019ve been able to reach an agreement that provides quality of life and continued career growth at Alaska,\u201d the airline said in a statement. The agreement still needs the approval of union leadership and rank-and-file members to go into effect. In February, rank-and-file members voted 99.5% in favor of authorizing a strike. However, under the Railway Labor Act, the labor law that covers airline workers, its members could not go on strike, even though their contract had reached its scheduled end date in December 2022. Instead, the union members continued to work under the terms and pay dictated by that contract. Such restrictions on striking don\u2019t exist for most private sector employees. In February, flight attendants from Alaska \u2014 along with American, United and Southwest \u2014held unprecedented coordinated pickets demanding new contracts. Since then, flight attendants at Southwest reached a deal that included an immediate 22.3% raise as of May 1 and $364 million in retroactive wages. Meanwhile, flight attendants at American and United are still seeking new deals. American flight attendants have asked to be released from restrictions so they can go on strike, but even if that is granted there would be months of cooling off periods before they could walk out, under the Railway Labor Act. Steve Maller, a flight attendant for nearly 20 years, was among those on the picket lines in February. Maller was one of the flight attendants on the Alaska Airlines Flight 1282, which drew international attention on January 5 when a door plug blew off, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the plane. Maller told CNN in February that he and the other members of the flight crew were commended by Alaska Airlines\u2019 top management for their actions in the plane, which landed without serious injuries. But he said he picketed because the existing contract did not provide a livable wage for too many flight attendants. Maller said he has worked at times as a bartender and that most flight attendants he knows also have second jobs. \u201cYou have to have something to have livable pay, to make ends meet,\u201d he said. Maller said he\u2019s also worried the airline is losing too many veteran flight attendants who have gone years with little or now wage increase. \u201cIt was unheard of five years ago (for flight attendants to) quit their jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cNow we have 20, 25, 30 a month (quitting).\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/22/business/alaska-airlines-labor-deal-flight-attendants/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/23/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_21_economy_us-homes-prices-record-high", "text": "Homes in America are the most expensive they\u2019ve ever been, according to one measure. The median price of a previously owned US home climbed for the eleventh consecutive month in May, up 5.8% from a year ago, to $419,300, the National Association of Realtors said Friday. That\u2019s the highest price ever recorded by NAR. \u201cHome prices reaching new highs are creating a wider divide between those owning properties and those who wish to be first-time buyers,\u201d NAR\u2019s chief economist Lawrence Yun said in a release. \u201cStill, first-time buyers in the market understand the long-term benefits of owning.\u201d Housing affordability remains in the gutter: In addition to sky-high home prices, mortgage rates are still higher than anything seen in the decade before 2022. There still aren\u2019t enough homes in the market to keep up with demand, despite some improvements in recent months. The situation could improve somewhat later this year, when the Federal Reserve is expected to begin paring back interest rates from a 23-year high, which should bring down mortgage rates. But Fed officials have penciled in just one rate cut for this year, and the days of ultra-low interest rates are long gone. Economists don\u2019t expect the average mortgage rate to fall below 6% in 2024. Recent research from Zillow shows that in order for a median-income household to afford a monthly mortgage payment on the typical US home, it would need to save up more than $127,000 for a down payment. That\u2019s roughly double the median salary of a US worker. Potential homebuyers are indeed facing a tough market, but that doesn\u2019t seem to be deterring some: Sales of previously owned homes in the US are up from the decades lows in the fall and only edged lower by 0.7% in May to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.11 million. What\u2019s going on with housing supply? When supply doesn\u2019t keep up with demand, it pushes up prices. That\u2019s been the case in the US housing market for decades now. However, there have been some steps in the right direction: Total housing inventory has steadily increased throughout this year, according to NAR data. Inventory at the end of May stood at 1.28 million units, 6.7% higher from April and up 18.5% from a year ago. Homeowners who locked in a low rate before the\u00a0Fed\u00a0began to hike in 2022 have been unwilling or unable to sell their homes because of months of elevated mortgage\u00a0rates. But the recent growth in inventory may mean that homeowners are finally parting with their homes out of necessity because of life events such as marriage, divorce or new children, NAR\u2019s Yun has said. New home construction also contributes to housing supply, but high interest rates seem to have pumped the brakes on homebuilding. Housing starts fell in May to their lowest level since 2020, according to government statistics released Thursday, dropping by 5.5% from April. Building permits, seen as a forward indicator of future construction, came in below economists\u2019 expectations. This story is developing and will be updated.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/economy/us-homes-prices-record-high/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/23/2024", "section": "business"}}

The probe is yet another complication for the social media platform, which is already facing the threat of a potential US ban or a forced divestment from its Chinese parent company. The sources said that the FTC is probing TikTok over an alleged violation of the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection rule, which requires companies to notify parents and obtain consent before collecting data from children under 13. The agency is also investigating whether TikTok violated a portion of the FTC Act that prohibits \u201cunfair or deceptive\u201d business practices, the sources said, in denying that TikTok user data could be accessed by individuals in China. The FTC could bring a suit against TikTok or settle with the company in the coming weeks, according to one of the sources. Politico reported news of the probe earlier. When asked about the investigation, FTC Director of Public Affairs Douglas Farrar replied: \u201cNo comment.\u201d TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The FTC probe comes as TikTok faces an existential threat in the US. Earlier this month, a bipartisan group in the US House of Representatives voted to pass a law forcing TikTok to be sold by ByteDance or face a ban from US app stores. The bill is now before the Senate, and President Joe Biden has said he would sign it if it gets to his desk. Senate leaders, however, have indicated they are taking a deliberate approach \u2014\u00a0which could lead to delays or even potentially doom the House bill. The short-form video company, owned by Chinese firm ByteDance, has denied assertions that its app poses a national security threat to US citizens. TikTok, which does not operate in China, has said that the Chinese government has never accessed US user data. Cybersecurity experts say Chinese laws require ByteDance to cooperate with that country\u2019s intelligence demands\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a fact that, given ByteDance\u2019s ownership of TikTok, could hypothetically put US user data at risk. To address that issue, TikTok has taken steps to store its US user data on cloud servers controlled by US tech giant Oracle and established internal protocols limiting access by non-US employees. TikTok acknowledged to Congress in 2022 that employees based in China could access US user data, following a report that year by BuzzFeed News that ByteDance employees had accessed that information on multiple occasions. TikTok CEO Shou Chew, in his first appearance before Congress last year, also acknowledged that several ByteDance employees were fired for spying on certain US journalists as part of a \u201cmisguided attempt\u201d to hunt down leakers within the company.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/ftc-tiktok-probe-privacy-and-security/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/23/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2022_04_25_business_electric-hybrid-corvette", "text": "General Motors will produce a fully electric Chevrolet Corvette, GM President Mark Reuss announced in a LinkedIn post Monday morning.  Reuss didn\u2019t say when the electric Corvette would come, but he hinted that a hybrid model could come relatively soon. \u201cWe will offer an electrified Corvette as early as next year,\u201d he wrote. An accompanying video the company posted to Twitter showed what appeared to be a hybrid Corvette, and in another first, showed the front wheels spinning and throwing snow as if being powered. All Corvettes produced by the company previously have been rear-wheel-drive only. While Reuss\u2019s post implies a hybrid Corvette will be based on the current generation of the car, it\u2019s not clear if the all-electric version will be a variation of this car or a completely different future model. \u201cElectrified\u201d is an auto industry term encompassing everything from hybrid to fully electric vehicles, and anything with an electric motor can count as \u201celectrified.\u201d It has long been rumored that the current generation of the Corvette, the first with its gasoline engine mounted behind the seats instead of in the front, could be built with a hybrid system. Reuss has also previously hinted there would be electrified variants of the car. Various companies are working on electric sports cars. Most all-electric vehicles in production so far have been four-door sedans and SUVs, as the need for batteries lends itself to larger and heavier vehicles. Tesla\u2019s first car, the Lotus Elise-based Tesla Roadster, was an electric sports car, but the second-generation of Tesla Roadster, originally unveiled as a prototype in 2017, has yet to go into production. Some manufacturers, such as Lamborghini, have said that current battery technology doesn\u2019t allow for a optimum sports car performance from a purely electric vehicle. Lamborghini has been working on plug-in hybrid sports cars, though. To date, the Corvette is only available in the base Stingray version with 6.2-liter V8 engine producing up to 495 horsepower. A 670 horsepower Corvette Z06 with a 5.5-liter V8 was unveiled last fall. The previous generation of the Corvette included included a 755-horsepower ZR1 version. Nothing like that has yet been announced for the current model but GM engineers have said a major reason for putting the engine in the back was to allow for better performance at extremely high horsepower levels. Besides saving gas, hybrid systems can also be used in high-performance cars to add additional power and to provide for quicker acceleration since electric motors can provide power to the wheels more quickly than gas engines. Ferrari\u2019s most powerful sports cars are hybrids, for instance.   GM has said it plans to produce only zero-emission vehicles, meaning fully electric or powered by hydrogen fuel cells, by 2035.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/25/business/electric-hybrid-corvette/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/23/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk", "text": "In a year of wild tech stories that has seen Elon Musk transform Twitter, cryptocurrency exchange FTX collapse and Silicon Valley Bank implode, this week\u2019s whiplash-inducing turmoil at OpenAI is among the most captivating. Sam Altman \u2014 the leader of one of the world\u2019s most influential AI companies, OpenAI, and perhaps the\u00a0most visible figure in the fledgling industry \u2014 was fired Friday night by the startup\u2019s directors in a surprise move. Less than five days later, he\u2019s back as the company\u2019s CEO, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. The series of extraordinary events unfolded just days after OpenAI held its\u00a0first-ever developer conference, where it laid out new, commercialized versions of its technology, including the option to customize its ChatGPT AI chatbot. If you\u2019re just catching up, here\u2019s what you missed from a week so incredible you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking the script could have been written by an early version of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Friday Around 3 p.m. ET, Altman joined a Google Meet call with most of OpenAI\u2019s board that had been convened by fellow co-founder and OpenAI chief scientist\u00a0Ilya Sutskever, during which Altman was fired and told that the news would soon be made public. Within the next half hour, the board also informed Greg Brockman, another co-founder and OpenAI president, that he would be removed from the board. Around 3:30 p.m. ET, OpenAI publicly announced that it had fired Altman over concerns that he was not always truthful with the board. The board said Mira Murati, the company\u2019s chief technology officer, would become interim CEO. OpenAI\u2019s strategic partners, including its biggest financial backer Microsoft, were also reportedly informed of Altman\u2019s ouster just minutes before the board\u2019s announcement. Hours after being fired, Altman posted on X that he \u201cloved working with such talented people\u201d and that he would have \u201cmore to say about what\u2019s next later.\u201d Brockman promptly quit. \u201cPlease don\u2019t spend any time being concerned. We will be fine,\u201d Brockman\u00a0said in a Friday post\u00a0on X. \u201cGreater things coming soon.\u201d A key factor in the CEO\u2019s firing was\u00a0tension between Altman, who favored developing AI\u00a0more aggressively, and members of the OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the unfolding events. Saturday Within 24 hours of Altman being fired, reports emerged that he and other ex-OpenAI loyalists were mulling plans for their own venture. OpenAI\u2019s board was also reportedly having second thoughts and considering asking the ousted CEO to return. Sunday By Sunday afternoon, Altman was\u00a0back at OpenAI\u2019s headquarters\u00a0\u2014 this time with a guest badge \u2014 to negotiate his potential return. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reportedly mediated the discussion. A 5 p.m. PT deadline was reportedly set for the board to agree to Altman\u2019s demands, including adding a seat for Microsoft, and reinstating him as CEO. But those talks broke down. As Sunday turned into Monday, Nadella tweeted that Altman, along with Brockman, would join Microsoft to run a new AI research group. At OpenAI, the group found a new interim CEO: Emmett Shear, the former CEO of Amazon\u2019s streaming service, Twitch. Murati would return to her role as OpenAI\u2019s chief technology officer. Monday In a post on X early Monday, Shear, who left his role at Twitch in March, described the chance to join OpenAI as \u201ca once-in-a-lifetime\u201d opportunity. He added that the company would hire an independent investigator to report on what happened in the lead-up to Altman\u2019s firing. But OpenAI employees were not convinced. More than 500 staffers signed an open letter calling on the company\u2019s board to resign and reinstate Altman and Brockman. They also threatened to follow the co-founders to Microsoft if their demands were not met. Altman posted on X, saying, \u201cwe have more unity and commitment and focus than ever before. we are all going to work together some way or other, and i\u2019m so excited. one team, one mission.\u201d The drama was far from over.\u00a0The Verge reported Monday afternoon\u00a0that Altman and Brockman could still return to OpenAI if the board members who fired him resign. And Nadella, speaking to CNBC, said he was \u201copen to both options\u201d when asked whether Altman would actually join Microsoft. \u201cLook, that is for the OpenAI board and management and the employees to choose,\u201d Nadella said. \u201cWe chose to explicitly partner with OpenAI and we want to continue to do so, and obviously, that depends on the people of OpenAI staying there or coming to Microsoft.\u201d Tuesday Altman\u00a0was reinstated late Tuesday as OpenAI\u2019s CEO, the company said on X. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman\u00a0wrote\u00a0that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his\u00a0post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it has backed with billions to bolster its ambitions in developing AI. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Nadella\u00a0said\u00a0on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/23/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_27_media_nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over", "text": "Only 80 hours elapsed between NBC News announcing Ronna McDaniel as a paid contributor and the network ousting her from that very role. But for the leadership at NBC Universal News Group, those were 80\u00a0painful hours. On Tuesday evening, following another full day in which the media rumor mill churned at warp speed, NBCU News Group boss Cesar Conde sent staff a memo, notifying his troops that he had reversed his decision to welcome the former Republican National Committee chair to \u201cthe team.\u201d \u201cAfter listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor,\u201d Conde said, adding that he wanted to \u201cpersonally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down.\u201d Conde had no real choice. The embattled NBCU boss, who I\u2019m told dealt with the crisis from an unknown location outside of 30 Rock, was facing an unprecedented rebellion from his most high-profile stars, who one by one went on the air and excoriated leadership\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel. The only aspect of Conde\u2019s note that was surprising was the fact that it came 48 hours late, allowing what started off as a crisis to fester and balloon into one of the worst corporate public relations calamities in recent memory. \u201cWhat a sh*t show!\u201d a media executive exclaimed to me Tuesday shortly after Conde relieved McDaniel of her NBC News credentials. In his note, Conde said he took \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for McDaniel\u2019s hire. But, he also did point the finger, telling staffers that hiring her was \u201ca collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team.\u201d Indeed, multiple people familiar with the matter have told me that the infighting among NBC executives over who was at fault for the disaster has reached a fever pitch, with various factions of the NBCU News Group assigning blame to others. Regardless of who is to blame, the entire affair made clear who is actually in control of the company \u2014 and it\u2019s not Conde & Co. Despite the NBCU C-suite digging their heels in the sand as they resisted dumping McDaniel for days, they were ultimately forced to succumb to pressure from their talent. As a second media executive commented to me, it is now \u201cvery clear who is in charge\u201d after the \u201cweak leadership was put on full display.\u201d \u201cHas Cesar lost the room?\u201d wondered a third media executive. While the Peacock family argues over who was really at fault, the company is facing a fresh public relations mess. Led by Donald Trump, right-wing personalities are already assailing the network as being overrun with intolerant woke leftists. \u201cThese Radical Left Lunatics are CRAZY and the top people at NBC ARE WEAK,\u201d Trump raged on his Truth Social platform. Ari Fleischer, who served as press secretary under President George W. Bush, wrote on X: \u201cWhat NBC is saying is if you\u2019re for Trump, you don\u2019t belong. Good. Let NBC be for Democrats only.\u201d Of course, that narrative is intellectually dishonest. The objection to McDaniel from both within and outside of NBCU was not that she is a Republican. It wasn\u2019t even that she was a Trump-supporting Republican. No, the objection stemmed from the fact that McDaniel was an active participant in the plot to subvert the 2020 vote. And, in addition to that disgraceful history, she had a lengthy track record smearing NBC News and MSNBC. Nevertheless, NBCU will now have to contend with such dishonest attacks being leveled by the right, which will follow them in the days, months, and even years to come. As unfair as it may be, they will certainly damage the network\u2019s brand in Republican circles \u2014 a place it had gone through great pains to appeal to. NBCU will also have to grapple with McDaniel, who spent the last 24 hours or so interviewing lawyers as she gears up for a possible legal fight with the network, according to a person familiar with the matter. The rift between McDaniel and NBCU had grown to such an extent by Tuesday that she was not informed by network brass that she had been dismissed, I\u2019m told. Instead, McDaniel learned of her ouster in press reports. While NBCU is being beaten up on the right, the company\u2019s leadership was quickly praised by its journalists and top stars. Shortly after Conde sent out his memo, Rachel Maddow appeared on Joy Reid\u2019s show, where the two lauded Conde for reversing course. \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/27/media/nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/23/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_21_economy_outdoor-workers-extreme-heat-temperature", "text": "The skin gets flush with fever, the breaths grow short, the heart races, dizziness sets in. The helmet and goggles only make matters worse, trapping heat on the head and the eyes. There\u2019s little to no escape from sweltering temperatures for construction workers like Eva Marroquin, who cleans work sites in Austin, Texas, and has worked in the industry for 17 years. \u201cIt damages our body when we work in construction; for example, I have suffered two heat attacks, one lately that made me very sick,\u201d Marroquin, 50, told CNN via an interpreter in a video interview. The blazing temperatures and searing sunlight have damaged her eyes, causing cataracts. Even worse, she says, she\u2019s lost fellow workers who have died from heat-related injuries. Since 2010, she\u2019s worked closely with the Workers Defense Project, an organization that advocates for protections for low-wage, immigrant workers in the Texas construction industry. \u201cYou feel death at your doorstep, but we have no choice but to go to work,\u201d she added. Another punishing wave of intense heat has put much of the US in a vice grip this week, subjecting some workers to dangerous (if not deadly) conditions; disrupting small and large businesses; sapping away consumer spending and tourism; and taking a big bite out of economic activity. It\u2019s estimated that heatwaves result in a 1% loss of global economic activity, a GDP hit that\u2019s forecast to grow to 3.2% by 2050, according to newly revised projections from Chris Lafakis, director at Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cThere\u2019s a chronic physical risk,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are things that occur over a longer period of time, they accumulate and become more costly and disruptive as time progresses and the temperature steadily increases.\u201d An economic letter published last month by researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and Williams College in Massachusetts estimated that by 2200, extreme heat will reduce the US capital stock, or the value of accumulated investment, by 5.4% and annual consumption by 1.8%, primarily attributable to labor productivity losses in construction (and, subsequently, fewer buildings being built). \u201cExtreme heat doesn\u2019t just affect economic output today, it can have really long-lasting economic consequences,\u201d said Gregory P. Casey, assistant professor of economics at Williams College and a co-author of the study. And that doesn\u2019t even account for extreme heat\u2019s interaction with other types of climate change events, he said. \u201cFor example, you get a natural disaster that destroys a bunch of buildings, and you\u2019re needing to rebuild but this extreme heat is making it harder to supply new buildings,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are these interesting interactions that we think will probably even increase the quantitative importance about this.\u201d \u2018Invisible\u2019 disaster with unequal risks The summers are indeed getting longer and hotter. The heatwave season has steadily grown in recent decades, climbing from an average of 53.5 days in the 2000s to 68.5 days in the 2010s and 72.7 days in the 2020s, according to Environmental Protection Agency data. And, according to the EPA, heatwaves are occurring more often than they used to and delivering higher temperatures in the process, exacerbating the human and economic risks. \u201cHeat doesn\u2019t get as much attention publicly, because it\u2019s invisible in a lot of ways,\u201d said Jenny Schuetz, an economist and senior fellow at Brookings Metro. \u201cBut more people in the US are exposed to high heat risk than to either floods or wildfires.\u201d Those risks aren\u2019t shared equally: A 2021 study from researchers at University of California and Stanford University found that low-income workers experience five times as many heat-related injuries than those who are the highest earners. \u201cWe forget that [air conditioning is] not an option for a lot of people,\u201d she said. \u201cLow-income households are more likely to live in older buildings that weren\u2019t built with central air. Even if they have air conditioning, it\u2019s expensive to run, and people can\u2019t afford the extra utility bills, so they ration how much air conditioning they\u2019re allowed to use.\u201d A lot of lower-income households are also more likely to have jobs that are exposed to heat, such as landscape gardeners, construction workers, delivery drivers and warehouse workers. \u201cThose are not white-collar jobs, and so many policymakers tend to forget that a lot of Americans just don\u2019t have air conditioning in their workplaces, in their homes, in their schools,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd they really can\u2019t escape it when we have these high-heat waves.\u201d The $15 to $17 an hour Eva Marroquin earns isn\u2019t enough to fully support her family, so the mother of five supplements her income by cleaning houses, many of which are not air conditioned. Slowing down small businesses It\u2019s barely just now summer, and heatwaves are already slowing down small businesses, according to Homebase, which provides payroll software to more than 100,000 small businesses, covering 2 million hourly workers. The high heat has weighed on hiring, employee hours and businesses\u2019 ability to stay open, as well as the amount of money they\u2019re bringing in, said John Waldmann, Homebase founder and chief executive officer. \u201cUsually, there\u2019s a pretty nice growth that comes in employment and hours worked at the start of the summer,\u201d he said. \u201cAs businesses ramp up, particularly in the hospitality world, that looked far more muted this year than in previous years across the board. And in regions where heat was extreme, we actually saw those number dip.\u201d He added: \u201cSo there were fewer people working and fewer hours worked than we would expect to have seen.\u201d Especially after last year\u2019s record-breaking summer, businesses aren\u2019t remaining stagnant, he said. They\u2019re trying to adapt by taking a variety of approaches, including installing shades to counteract the heat and save on the A/C bills and changing their operating hours, he added. \u201cI think anything that impacts small businesses is affecting the economy as a whole,\u201d he said, noting how small businesses account for half the jobs in the country. \u201cWhen we see changes in behavior in small businesses, like what we\u2019re talking about here, usually that\u2019s an early indication of how things are changing in the economy as a whole.\u201d In May, there was a 1.4% decline in the number of businesses open versus April in the Southeast, an area that faced high temperatures, according to Homebase data. Ice packs for vaccines, water jugs for farmhands This week Boston not only set a record-high temperature, but also had its heat index rocket to 108, breaking a 101-year-old record. Katie Parent works as a mobile veterinarian, driving around Greater Boston and making house calls. For herself, the high heat is more of an inconvenience; the car\u2019s hotter and she just needs to pack some extra water. For her supplies and her patients, it\u2019s more complex. The owner of the Doorbell Pet Doctor needs to ensure the vaccines and other temperature-sensitive materials she transports stay cool. She doesn\u2019t have an in-house lab, so she needs to pack her shipments carefully and plentifully with ice packs and hopes that UPS ships them in the appropriate time. Hot summers can be hard on pets, especially older dogs. The heat dome that blanketed Boston and many northeastern states also stretched well into America\u2019s heartland. The Greer family farm in Princeton, Indiana, got a late start to putting the soybeans in the ground because of a recent bout of heavy rain. Now, the sixth-generation farm is having to contend with the excessive heat. \u201cIt\u2019s very hot today, it\u2019s almost like we\u2019re in a heatwave,\u201d said Denise Greer Jamerson, who runs the farm with her 87-year-old father, Norman, and her 31-year-old son. The summers have been getting hotter, she said, adding that the winters are milder and shorter. To help prepare her family and the handful of workers on the family\u2019s 100-acre farm, Greer Jamerson bought everyone big, handheld water jugs to ensure they\u2019re staying hydrated on these hot days. The family has also implemented automatic timers to ensure the crops are being watered appropriately. Despite temperatures rising to the mid-90s, it hasn\u2019t deterred her father from getting out into the fields. He just wakes up earlier. \u201cIn this industry, you\u2019ve got to get it done when you have that window of opportunity, because that\u2019s the one thing that we cannot control is the climate,\u201d she said. \u2018We will close our doors in a heartbeat\u2019 Caribou, Maine, the most northeastern city in the United States, saw its heat index \u2014 a measure that describes how heat feels to the human body \u2014 soar on Wednesday to a never-before-seen value of 103 as the temperature hit a record-tying 96 degrees, according to the National Weather Service. That was a good 22 degrees hotter than the high typically seen this time of year. \u201cIt\u2019s really, really hot outside \u2026 it\u2019s sweltering,\u201d said Tamara Lovewell, co-owner of the Ruska Coffee Company in downtown Caribou. Inside, the coffee shop and caf\u00e9 was still doing brisk business during breakfast and lunch. The family-run outfit decided to turn off the oven, the panini presses, the steam table and warming lamps and instead crafted a new limited-time menu of cold items such as sandwiches, wraps and salads. \u201cWe don\u2019t have A/C in the kitchen,\u201d she said. \u201cFor now, we just changed out our menu, so we don\u2019t have all of the hot equipment on to alleviate the extra stress on the staff.\u201d The heat pumps have been running strong for the front of the house but are not able to fully keep the hot air at bay. It was running a little warm inside on Wednesday, she said, but it was manageable for staff and guests. Still, Lovewell said she\u2019s keeping close watch on the temperature as well as everybody else to make sure folks are safe. \u201cIf it gets too hot in here, we will close our doors in a heartbeat,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will never subject anyone here to unnecessary risks.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/economy/outdoor-workers-extreme-heat-temperature/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/23/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_20_cars_bugatti-horsepower-hybrid", "text": "Bugatti has unveiled its new model, the Bugatti Tourbillon, a massively powerful hybrid with an equally impressive price tag. The car will replace the $3.3 million, 1,500 horsepower Bugatti Chiron. You might have expected Bugatti\u2019s new model to be all-electric. Not only is the industry headed in that direction, but in 2021 Bugatti was spun off from Volkswagen Group and merged with Rimac, the Croatian company that makes the all-electric Rimac Nevera supercar. But Mate Rimac, the chief executive of the new company, now called Bugatti Rimac, said he never had any intention of making an all-electric Bugatti. As gasoline-powered cars gradually fade from the world\u2019s roads, Bugatti Rimac\u2019s engineers and designers wanted to create something that retained the spirit of mechanically powered Bugatti cars, just better: An insanely powerful plug-in hybrid. Like the Bugatti Chiron and Veyron models before it, the new Bugatti Tourbillon will have a huge, 16-cylinder gas engine. The engine, which was designed in cooperation with the British race car engineering firm Cosworth, will be assisted by three powerful electric motors. One motor in the back of the car and two more in the front will be capable of producing at least 800 horsepower on their own. In total, the Bugatti Tourbillon will be able to put out at least 1,800 horsepower, according to Bugatti Rimac. The electric motors will help make up for the new gas engine\u2019s lack of turbochargers. The Chiron\u2019s gas engine had four turbochargers that pushed air into the engine to help it produce more power. Mate Rimac said they wanted this new engine to be \u201cnaturally aspirated,\u201d meaning there would be no turbochargers. \u201cWe wanted to make the most exciting, most emotional combustion engine possible,\u201d Rimac said, \u201cand that is high revving, naturally aspirated.\u201d The car\u2019s interior is, likewise, an homage to old-fashioned machinery. The Tourbillon is named after a set of gears that helps maintain accuracy in a mechanical watch. The Bugatti\u2019s instrument display is modeled on mechanical watch dials. \u201cOne of the first things we did when the new company was formed, I took the whole team to Switzerland and we visited a few watchmakers,\u201d Rimac told CNN. The central speedometer display even has two needles like the hands of a clock. The long hand shows the car\u2019s speed while the short hand registers the revolutions per minute of the high-revving 16-cylinder engine. With a fully charged battery, the car will be able to travel about 37 miles on purely electric power before the gas engine needs to turn on, but the driver will have the option to run the gas engine continuously, if they wish. Unlike past Bugattis, though, the Tourbillon does have a reasonably large display screen with Apple CarPlay available. The screen will only come out and become visible when the driver requests it, though. In general, Bugatti designers have avoided putting screens in the cars in the belief that computer displays look outmoded quickly. \u201cWe think, really, how will this product look in 50 years, 100 years,\u201d said Rimac. \u201cAnd it\u2019s clear that, if you have a screen, it won\u2019t look that great.\u201d The cars will still be assembled one at a time at Bugatti\u2019s small factory in Molsheim, France. A total of only 250 Tourbillons will be built, Mate Rimac said, at a starting price of roughly $4 million each.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/cars/bugatti-horsepower-hybrid/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/23/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_21_business_amazon-stops-using-plastic-pillows", "text": "Amazon is eliminating the use of the puffy plastic air pillows used in delivery boxes, joining other major companies that are cutting their plastic use. The company said it was shipping 15 billion plastic pillows annually, and the changes represent its largest plastic packaging reduction effort in North America. Amazon has  already stopped using them in 95% of deliveries and they will stop completely by the end of the year. A new paper filler made from 100% recycled content will replace the plastic pillows. Amazon says it offers the same, if not better, protection to products. The announcement comes ahead of Prime Day, the shopping spectacular held in July, which Amazon said that nearly all of its Prime Day deliveries will be free of plastic air pillows. Amazon has stopped using plastic pillows in other countries, including Australia, India and nations across Europe, in recent years, which resulted the company in using nearly 12% less plastic in 2023 compared to the year prior. Pollution from single-use plastic remains a major problem, with a\u00a0recent report\u00a0finding that companies are producing record amounts despite efforts to be more sustainable. Plastic is problematic because it\u2019s mostly made from polymers created from dangerous fossil fuels.

{"id": "2024_06_18_media_jeff-bezos-washington-post-publisher-dilemma", "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:\u00a0A version of this article first appeared in the \u201cReliable Sources\u201d newsletter.\u00a0Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here. Jeff Bezos\u00a0has a decision to make \u2014 and it is one that will determine the future course of one of the nation\u2019s most prestigious news organizations. The\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0owner and\u00a0Amazon\u00a0billionaire can continue to stand by\u00a0Will Lewis, the controversy plagued\u00a0Fleet Street\u00a0veteran he tapped as publisher and chief executive of the iconic national broadsheet. Or he can side with his\u00a0Pulitzer Prize-winning newsroom, which is repudiating their new leader in clear and unmistakable terms. But based on conversations with CNN on Monday with nearly a dozen staffers and others familiar with the internal dynamics of The Post, it appears increasingly unlikely that Bezos can have it both ways. Lewis, who continues to face heavy scrutiny over a series of troubling decisions both past and present, has unquestionably lost the room, alienating staffers and creating an untenable position in which it is difficult to see him effectively leading the respected army of reporters under his command. There may have been a moment in which the former\u00a0Rupert Murdoch\u00a0lieutenant could have turned the tide and quelled the uproar within The Post. That fury first saw life shortly after his decision to oust top editor\u00a0Sally Buzbee. In the wake of her sudden exit, it was revealed that he tried to suppress stories at The Post and\u00a0NPR\u00a0about his role cleaning up the\u00a0U.K. phone hacking scandal for Murdoch (which he denies wrongdoing in). Instead of deescalating the situation early on, Lewis lashed out, going so far as to criticize his own media reporters and launch an on-the-record attack aimed at the well-respected NPR media correspondent\u00a0David Folkenflik. And while Lewis later sent the newsroom an apologetic memo following the episodes, it did little to quell concerns, setting into motion a series of stories that have raised serious questions about his judgment and journalistic values, as well as those of his hand-picked future top editor,\u00a0Robert Winnett. The New York Times\u00a0reported over the weekend\u00a0that, in his Fleet Street days, Lewis assigned an article that was based on stolen phone records. And The Post\u00a0reported Sunday that\u00a0a \u201cthief\u201d who used deceptive tactics to obtain private material had ties with Winnett. The stories landed like a one-two punch in The Post newsroom, raising even more alarm and upping the panic level at the newspaper to new heights. Incensed, anxious, and demoralized staffers stressed to CNN on Monday that they just want Bezos to bring this \u201cshit show,\u201d as one staffer put it, to an end. When Bezos first appointed Lewis, staffers at The Post understood that he needed to appoint a publisher and chief executive who would shake things up in the newsroom. They acknowledged to CNN that, under previous boss\u00a0Fred Ryan, The Post had fallen behind outlets like The Times in the post-Donald Trump\u00a0years, both from audience and financial standpoints. And so, when Lewis took the reins in January, the newsroom was more or less, cautiously optimistic about how he would transform the institution. They were willing to give him a chance. But they\u2019re not willing to let him shred the newspaper\u2019s reputation in the process. While the journalists continue to worry about the financial state of their newsroom and want a boss who can seriously address its business woes, they fiercely guard its editorial independence and integrity. And, with respect to that, they strongly believe Lewis and Winnett pose a significant danger. \u201cWe are losing audience and money and the top of the company is a clown show,\u201d a staffer explained to CNN, adding, \u201cAll we have is our credibility and we\u2019ve just taken a gun to that.\u201d The newspaper\u2019s credibility, of course, is inextricably linked to whether it can be a thriving business. Good luck getting people to subscribe to a newspaper that they believe has been ethically compromised. (I would love to see that sales pitch!) And, as one staffer at The Post noted to CNN, behaving in an ethical manner matters greatly when trying to convince a newsroom to reinvent itself. As the person said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how good your ideas are if you have a no-confidence vote from your entire staff.\u201d That said, what Bezos will decide to do as he assesses the situation at The Post remains a mystery. Questions to his spokesperson went unanswered on Monday. And an email sent directly to Bezos went unreturned. But certainly, the tech baron is aware of the rapidly deteriorating situation over on\u00a0K Street. And, presumably, Bezos does not want his stewardship of The Post to be stained by an ugly chapter in which he allowed grave problems to fester and eat away at the institution as he sat idly by. Dismissing Lewis would bring with it some pain for Bezos, sure. It would require him to concede that he got it wrong with Lewis and restart the time-consuming process of finding another publisher. And it might cost him a nice chunk of change \u2014 though an irrelevant one for someone of Bezos\u2019 wealth \u2014 to pay out Lewis\u2019 contract. But keeping Lewis in the position could deliver an even greater level of pain and, with it, unflattering headlines over time. More stories about Lewis are sure to drop in the days and weeks ahead. Top talent may soon head for the exits (indeed, I\u2019m told some staffers are already looking for work elsewhere). And at some point it becomes hard to see how Bezos justifies having a boss oversee a newspaper that is publishing A1 stories spotlighting his ethically-challenged decisions. The best advice in crisis public relations is to reach to the end result as quickly as possible, to avoid an unrelenting drip-drip of bad news. Bezos can surely do the math on this one, given it is not too complicated. And perhaps that is why his camp is not voicing public support for Lewis. Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, the renowned professor and senior associate dean for leadership studies at the\u00a0Yale School of Management, told CNN on Monday that Bezos has a simple decision to make. Sonnenfeld, who has advised U.S. presidents and scores of corporate leaders, said that if he were advising Bezos, he would tell him Lewis has \u201clost legitimacy to lead\u201d and it\u2019s time to \u201cclean the house.\u201d \u201cThis is a tragic meltdown of the conscience of American journalism bringing shame to the\u00a0Katharine Graham,\u00a0Ben Bradlee,\u00a0Marty Baron\u00a0legacy of collaboration, courage and integrity,\u201d Sonnenfeld said. \u201cBezos must recruit an accomplished, experienced editor whom journalists admire and trust.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/media/jeff-bezos-washington-post-publisher-dilemma/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/23/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl", "text": "Sam Altman has agreed to return to lead OpenAI, the company said in a Tuesday post on X, just days after his surprise ouster as chief executive sparked an employee revolt that threatened to undermine what has been the leading company in the fledgling artificial intelligence industry. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman wrote that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft, which is the ChatGPT maker\u2019s biggest financial backer. The announcement appears to bring to an end days of chaos for the AI industry that included negotiations over who should lead OpenAI and how the firm should be run, as well as broader discussions about just how fast the arms race to develop AI technology should be moving. The details of Altman\u2019s firing and re-hiring remain murky. In its announcement Friday, OpenAI claimed that Altman had been insufficiently \u201ccandid\u201d with the board. That ambiguous language sent the rumor mill flying. But a key factor in Altman\u2019s ouster was the presence of\u00a0tensions between Altman, who favored pushing AI development more aggressively, and members of the original OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the crisis. As of Monday morning, Nadella had announced that Altman, along with fellow OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, would be joining Microsoft to lead a new AI research division. OpenAI said it had hired former Twitch chief Emmett Shear as interim CEO. But then hundreds of OpenAI employees, nearly the company\u2019s entire staff, threatened to leave, potentially for Microsoft, if the company\u2019s board didn\u2019t resign and reinstate Altman as CEO. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it invested billions in to help bolster its ambitions in developing AI, which many in Silicon Valley think will be the most important wave of technological advancement in the coming decades. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Microsoft CEO\u00a0Satya Nadella said on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d Altman\u2019s vision to quickly roll out and commercialize AI tools also appears to have won out. Publicly, Altman has long cautioned about risks posed by AI, and he\u202fhas pledged to lawmakers and customers that he would move OpenAI forward responsibly. \u201cIs [AI] gonna be like the printing press that diffused knowledge, power and learning widely across the landscape that empowered ordinary, everyday individuals that led to greater flourishing, that led above all to greater liberty?\u201d he said in a May Senate subcommittee hearing pressing for regulation. \u201cOr is it gonna be more like the atom bomb \u2014 huge technological breakthrough, but the consequences (severe, terrible) continue to haunt us to this day?\u201d But inside the company, Altman had been pushing to bring products to market more quickly and to sell them for a profit. Altman announced a few weeks ago at OpenAI\u2019s first-ever developer day that the company would make tools available so anyone could create their own version of ChatGPT. OpenAI has also worked with Microsoft to roll out ChatGPT-like technology across Microsoft\u2019s products. OpenAI and iPhone designer Jony Ive had also reportedly\u202fbeen in talks to raise $1 billion from Japanese conglomerate SoftBank for an AI device to replace the smartphone. \u2014 CNN\u2019s Juliana Liu and Diksha Madhok contributed reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/23/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_media_nbc-news-ousts-ronna-mcdaniel", "text": "NBC News on Tuesday ousted former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel, just days after her hiring as a paid political analyst sparked intense backlash from the network\u2019s top television anchors over McDaniel\u2019s role in subverting the 2020 election and attacks on the press. \u201cThere is no doubt that the last several days have been difficult for the News Group,\u201d NBCUniversal News Group President Cesar Conde said in a memo to staff. \u201cAfter listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor.\u201d \u201cI want to personally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down,\u201d Conde continued. \u201cWhile this was a collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team, I approved it and take full responsibility for it.\u201d Ahead of the network\u2019s decision, McDaniel spent the day Tuesday interviewing attorneys in preparation for a potential legal battle with NBC, a person familiar with the matter told CNN. Creative Artists Agency, the talent agency that brokered McDaniel\u2019s deal with NBC, also parted ways with her, the person said. The reversal comes after journalists and anchors at both NBC and its cable news sibling MSNBC publicly denounced the decision to hire McDaniel as a paid analyst in a stunning and unprecedented on-air rebuke of network brass that has embarrassed the Peacock Network. McDaniel, who recently stepped down from the RNC under pressure from former President Donald Trump, was involved in attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. As head of the RNC, she was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d In the years since, McDaniel continued to claim that the election had \u201cproblems\u201d and that Biden did not legitimately win the election, fanning the flames of election denialism. NBC\u2019s announcement Friday that it had hired McDaniel was quickly met with alarm by the network\u2019s journalists. The revolt spilled into public view on Sunday when McDaniel appeared on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with moderator Kristen Welker in her first interview since she was hired by the network. Welker disclosed that the interview had been scheduled to take place prior to NBC announcing McDaniel would become a paid contributor for the network, stating that she had no involvement in her hiring. Following the interview, Chuck Todd, NBC News\u2019 chief political analyst, delivered a stinging on-air criticism of NBC executives for their decision to hire McDaniel, telling Welker, \u201cI think our bosses owe you an apology for putting you in this situation.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a reason a lot of journalists at NBC News are uncomfortable with this,\u201d Todd said, explaining that under McDaniel, the RNC engaged in \u201cgaslighting\u201d and \u201ccharacter assassination\u201d when dealing with the news media. The following day, MSNBC hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough joined Todd in protesting the decision on their program \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d \u201cTo be clear, we believe NBC News should seek out conservative Republican voices to provide balance in their election coverage, but it should be conservative Republicans, not a person who used her position of power to be an anti-democracy election denier,\u201d\u00a0Brzezinski said. \u201cWe hope NBC will reconsider its decision. It goes without saying that she will not be a guest on \u2018Morning Joe\u2019 in her capacity as a paid contributor.\u201d Nicolle Wallace, host of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cDeadline: White House,\u201d later joined in the rebuke, saying on her program that the network\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel was nothing short of a potential threat to democracy. \u201cNBC News is, either wittingly or unwittingly, teaching election deniers that what they can do stretches well beyond appearing on our air and interviews to peddle lies about the sanctity and integrity of our elections,\u201d Wallace told viewers. Rachel Maddow \u2014 the network\u2019s biggest star \u2014 later devoted the first half-hour of her prime-time program to the controversy, saying the decision to hire McDaniel was \u201cinexplicable.\u201d Maddow took issue with McDaniel\u2019s long track record of demonizing the news media, labeling the press as \u201cfake news,\u201d and launching ugly attacks on NBC News journalists and MSNBC hosts. \u201cWe do not take it personally when we get attacked, when they say they want to put us on trial and execute us for treason,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so I want to associate myself with all my colleagues at MSNBC and NBC News who have voiced loud and principled objections to our company for putting on the payroll someone who hasn\u2019t just attacked us as journalists, but someone who is part of an ongoing project to get rid of our system of government,\u201d she said of McDaniel. \u201cSomeone who is still trying to convince Americans that this election stuff doesn\u2019t really work. That this last election wasn\u2019t a real result. That American elections are fraudulent.\u201c The on-air revolt ensnared NBC\u2019s top leaders, including NBCUniversal News Group chair Cesar Conde, NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown, who were responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring. MSNBC president Rashida Jones also did not object to the decision, people familiar with the matter said.

They\u2019re proposing a class action, alleging there are many others in a similar situation. In 2021, then-Disney CEO Bob Chapek announced a move of 2,000 positions from California\u00a0to Florida. But in May 2023, after CEO Bob Iger returned, the company\u00a0canceled the $1 billion Lake Nona office complex\u00a0amid a legal and political battle with Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis that has\u00a0since been settled. The plaintiffs, Maria De La Cruz and George Fong, both work for Disney\u2019s product design division. De La Cruz is vice president of product design, and Fong is a creative director, according to the complaint filed by\u00a0Lohr Ripamonti LLP on Tuesday. The lawsuit, which seeks an unspecified amount in damages, has not yet been processed by the Superior Court of Los Angeles. The complaint alleges that Disney misrepresented and concealed\u00a0its\u00a0true plans for the Lake Nona project,\u00a0hurting\u00a0\u2013 financially\u00a0and otherwise \u2013 at least\u00a0250 employees who had made the move from California to Florida. The complaint states employees were informed about the project to relocate 2,000 roles\u00a0to Florida in July of 2021 and that Disney \u201cmade it clear that employees who declined relocation would lose their jobs.\u201d The complaint\u00a0described\u00a0how De La Cruz and Fong sold their homes in Southern California and purchased homes in Central Florida. For Fong, that meant selling\u00a0the\u00a0childhood home that he inherited from his family. After the Lake Nona office project was canceled, De La Cruz\u00a0emailed human\u00a0resources about the future for those who might choose to stay in Florida,\u00a0writing: \u201cAfter all of this, will there be any security in our positions? My fear would be that we decide to stay in Florida, only to be laid off in the next year or so. I don\u2019t want to be punished for being put into a situation my company put me in,\u201d\u00a0the complaint says. The complaint says\u00a0De La Cruz and Fong decided\u00a0to move back to California to keep their jobs, but housing prices in the Lake Nona vicinity had dropped significantly after Disney\u2019s announcement. Fong\u00a0said\u00a0he\u00a0had trouble selling his Florida home, and when he managed to move back to California, mortgage rates and home prices had climbed so rapidly that he was only able to afford a smaller home than he previously had. \u201cMs. De La Cruz, Mr. Fong\u00a0and many others dutifully moved to Florida because they love their jobs, they love the people they work with, and they love Disney,\u201d Attorney Jason Lohr said. Disney has not replied to a request for comment. The company developing land in Lake Nona has confirmed with CNN that Disney still owns the 60 acres it had purchased for the new corporate campus. Disney has not said what will happen to this property.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/media/disney-employee-lawsuit/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/23/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_01_tech_aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl", "text": "A London-based technology company is looking to \u201cdemocratize\u201d talent-identification and scouting in soccer using a mobile app. Free to download and available globally, the aiScout app allows aspiring soccer stars to enter virtual trials for professional clubs by uploading self-recorded footage of themselves completing a series of drills. It offers 75 exercises, designed to test a range of skills, with videos showing users how to complete them. Performances are automatically scored by artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The data can then be accessed by clubs, allowing their scouts to peruse scores for viable talent, honing their search with a variety of filters; from age and gender to position on the pitch. The app currently has two English Premier League (EPL) partners, Chelsea and Burnley, and clubs can tailor their in-app trials to meet specific needs and set their own benchmarks by having their academy players complete the same drills. \u201cWe\u2019re putting that data up front to make better use of [the scouts\u2019] time,\u201d said Richard Felton-Thomas, chief operating officer of ai.io, the company behind the app. \u201cTo say [to scouts], \u2018Go over to this place today because there\u2019s three players in that game that are all actually beating your Chelsea standard\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s going to be the best use of your time.\u2019\u201d It already appears to be working for some. Ben Greenwood had never had a trial with a professional club until he downloaded the app in 2019. After uploading footage of himself, the 17-year-old landed a trial with Chelsea, becoming the first user of the app to get a trial with a pro club. He signed a contract\u00a0with EPL team Bournemouth\u00a0in 2021. \u2018It\u2019s more about evolution\u2019 Having beta-tested in with players spanning 125 countries, Greenwood among them, 135 players have been trialed or signed by pro clubs or national teams through the app \u2014 which fully launched in September 2023 \u2014 according to Felton-Thomas. Just over 100,000 players make up the current database, but with over 100 clubs lined up to join Chelsea and Burnley, as well as a multi-year partnership with Major League Soccer in the US announced last May, Felton-Thomas projects user numbers to surge into the millions as the operation ramps up this year. Felton-Thomas said the \u201clion\u2019s share\u201d of its income comes from charging clubs a license fee to run the platform. Annual fees vary depending on the size of the club and the tools they require, ranging from six figures for \u201ctier one\u201d sides like Chelsea, to thousands of pounds for clubs lower down the footballing pyramid. The use of smart technology in sport continues to expand, including\u00a0AI commentary tools and wearable tech for elite athletes. The global market for sports analytics, valued at\u00a0$2.7 billion\u00a0in 2023, is projected to grow 22% by the end of the decade, according to market research firm Grand View Research. Should soccer talent scouts be concerned about being edged out by the arrival of AI in their industry? For Felton-Thomas, new technologies can co-exist with traditional methods. \u201cIt\u2019s more about evolution than revolution,\u201d Felton-Thomas explained. \u201cWe can\u2019t tell you when that player\u2019s actually in that match, how does he deal with adversity? What happens when he\u2019s 2-0 down? What happens when someone\u2019s shouting at him? What happens when he\u2019s just made a massive mistake?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got the ability to just augment real people to do their jobs better and faster, which then gives an opportunity to the player through the AI, but you\u2019re still actually just connecting them to the human on the other side, which is the club and the scout.\u201d While football remains ai.io\u2019s primary focus, the company is looking into opportunities in other sports to launch in the coming years. Further ahead, it may branch out beyond sports. \u201cYou think about the notion that you can be at home and analyze your movements, and how this could spin into health care, physical assessments for military disciplines and emergency services,\u201d Felton-Thomas told CNN.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/01/tech/aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/23/2024", "section": "business"}}

Now, the chain is hoping to replicate that success with savory new companions. Beginning Tuesday, three new 12-inch long additions are arriving, called Dippers. They use Subway\u2019s flatbread, rolled up with pepperoni and cheese, chicken and cheese or double cheese, and served hot. The $3 rollups are part of its Sidekicks menu, adding to its successful lineup of giant cookies, churros and soft pretzels. Value is a major factor in the expansion of Sidekicks. Many fast food chains are releasing new menu items and discounts to lure back cash-strapped consumers, especially\u00a0low-income consumers who are dining out less often and\u00a0spending less when they do. Sidekicks and Dippers were born out of the chain seeing younger customers\u2019 preference for snacking, according to Douglas\u00a0Fry, Subway\u2019s North America president, who said they want \u201cconvenient, hand-held, grab-and-go\u201d food at an affordable price. \u201cWe know that the economic climate has started to shift,\u201d Fry told CNN. He observed that customers have \u201cbeen sacrificing quantity and quality,\u201d and that Subway offers a \u201cgreat value proposition of great-tasting food that\u2019s made fresh and is available for a variety of budgets.\u201d Dippers are a cost-efficient addition for Subway, using existing ingredients like flatbread from its recently unveiled wraps lineup and the meats and cheeses already used in its sandwiches. Subway\u2019s\u00a0new Sidekicks lineup is a key part of its turnaround plans, which includes a number of other changes to its menus as part of its efforts to keep up with rivals. Since the January launch, Fry said the chain has sold more than 30 million snacks, priced from $2 to $5, and \u201cprobably would have sold more\u201d if it wasn\u2019t for the cookie shortage. The addition of Sidekicks \u201cmakes sense,\u201d said David Henkes, senior principal at Technomic, previously telling CNN that Subway needs to increase revenue somewhere since fast food customers have begun pushing back on price increases amid overall inflation. \u201cThey\u2019ve underperformed in\u00a0the sandwich\u00a0segment, so they need to shake things up a little bit and drive some incremental traffic,\u201d Henkes said. Technomic data shows that Subway also lags in sales for sides and snacks compared to its competitors. In recent years, Subway has added\u00a0customization to its menu, doubled down on pushing orders to its app, increased its\u00a0international presence\u00a0and introduced\u00a0freshly sliced meats\u00a0\u2014 a major shift from Subway\u2019s previous method of delivering cold cuts pre-sliced. Another major hurdle for Subway is it its dwindling store count: The chain closed more than 400 restaurants in the US in 2023, finishing the year with its smallest number of US restaurants (20,133) since 2005. Owned by Roark Capital, a privately held company, Subway doesn\u2019t regularly release financial figures. The private equity firm holds investments in a number of large restaurant chains, including Arby\u2019s, Auntie Anne\u2019s, Buffalo Wild Wings and Sonic.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/food/subway-dippers-sidekick-expansion/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/23/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_21_business_cdk-global-car-dealership-outage", "text": "CDK Global is ubiquitous in the auto dealership world \u2013 its software is used at 15,000 dealers. Its products handle everything from records to scheduling. Now, thousands of dealerships across the United States and Canada are entering a third day in a near deadlock after two consecutive cyber incidents at CDK Global led to a shut down of its systems. There\u2019s never an opportune time for a systems outage, but it\u2019s now the official start of summer, a time when many Americans are shopping for a new car and dealerships enjoy a bump in sales. Here\u2019s what the CDK Global outage means for both car sellers and shoppers. What exactly happened? On Wednesday, CDK spokesperson Lisa Finney told CNN that the company was investigating a cyber incident. \u201cOut of an abundance of caution and concern for our customers, we have shut down most of our systems and are working diligently to get everything up and running as quickly as possible,\u201d Finney said in the statement. Later Wednesday, the company said most of its critical computer systems were back online. But Thursday morning, the company told dealerships another incident had happened. North Carolina-based Sonic Automotive said it was a \u201ccybersecurity incident.\u201d CNN has asked CDK to confirm. Are systems still shut down? CDK said it proactively shut down most of its systems after it experienced an additional cyber incident late in the evening on Wednesday, June 19. \u201cIn partnership with third party experts, we are assessing the impact and providing regular updates to our customers. We remain vigilant in our efforts to reinstate our services and get our dealers back to business as usual as quickly as possible,\u201d the company said in a statement Thursday. On Thursday afternoon, the company said it still had no new information. The company told dealers the systems could be down for several days, according to two sources briefed on the situation. What does CDK Global do? CDK Global provides data and technology to different automotive dealerships. Its systems are used by roughly 15,000 car dealerships across the United States and Canada. CDK operates different products that car dealers use to handle things like keeping records of negotiated deals to scheduling and communicating about service. Not every dealer uses CDK\u2019s products, and even those that do may not use them for everything, but the system shutdown has been a problem for many. To protect customer privacy, customers\u2019 details aren\u2019t written out on a piece of paper that\u2019s just sitting on a desk anymore. Instead, information about deals and customer appointments is\u00a0kept in a server that\u2019s now impossible for salespeople affected by the outage to access. Why is this a bad time for dealerships? The outage can eat into sales during the first official weekend of the summer. Summer is car-buying season. CDK said it themselves in a blog post on its site last week. Post Memorial Day, \u201cthis presents increased opportunities for vehicle sales, service and, of course, revenue. It also means that it\u2019s time to roll out your summer Sales and Service marketing campaigns.\u201d In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Sonic Automotive said the outage resulted in disruptions to its dealer management system hosted by CDK, \u201cwhich supports critical dealership operations including those supporting sales, inventory and accounting functions and its customer relationship management system.\u201d The company said that while the outage has affected its business operations, it hasn\u2019t determined the financial impact. Can I still buy a car? Jeff Ramsey, an executive with Ourisman Auto Group, which is headquartered in Maryland, told CNN the shutdown is a major hassle and could cost his dealerships some business. Customers who are delayed in closing a sale at one of his dealerships could just find a dealer nearby that\u2019s not having these issues and buy a new vehicle there, instead. However, some affected dealerships are still selling cars. \u201cMy selling team can hand-write a buyer\u2019s order,\u201d said Brian Benstock, general manager of Paragon Honda and Paragon Acura in Long Island City, New York. But salespeople could lack access to customer agreements that had been previously negotiated, making it harder to close those sales, dealers CNN spoke with said. There\u2019s more than just the negotiated price of the car involved, since these agreements can involve rebates and incentives, some of which customers must show they\u2019re qualified for. What are automakers saying? Ramsey, whose company operates a number of dealerships, said automakers including Kia, Toyota and Stellantis, which makes Jeep and Dodge vehicles, have been very helpful with finding ways to serve customers even with all technology issues. Ford also said its dealerships involved in the CDK outage have alternate ways to take care of customers. \u201cAlthough there is an industry-wide system outage for some dealers who use CDK, Ford and Lincoln customers are able to receive sales and service support due to alternative processes available to our dealers. While a customer\u2019s local dealer remains the best place for information about their sales and service needs, they can always contact the Ford Customer Relationship Center at 1-800-392-3673,\u201d Ford said in a statement shared with CNN.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/business/cdk-global-car-dealership-outage/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/23/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_12_success_equal-pay-day-2024", "text": "March 12 marks Equal Pay Day in the United States, a symbolic date representing the number of days women have to work into the current year just to make the same amount of money men made in the prior one. Put another way, to make 12 months\u2019 worth of a man\u2019s median wages, a woman has to work about 14.5 months. In dollars and cents, for every dollar a man earns, a woman is paid 84 cents, according to the National Committee on Pay Equity and the Equal Pay Today campaign. That\u2019s based on earnings data for full-time, year-round workers from the US Census in 2022, which was the most recent full-year data set available. If part-time workers and those not employed year-round are included, the gender pay gap is worse, at 78 cents on the dollar, said Deborah Vagins, national campaign director of Equal Rights Advocates and director of Equal Pay Today. The size of the actual wage gap between men and women will widen or narrow depending on age, level of education, choice of occupation and tenure, as well as race and ethnicity. The gender pay gap is typically widest when comparing the earnings of White men to Black, Hispanic or Native American women. And, generally speaking, the gap is narrower in a given job when men and women are in their early- to mid-20s (i.e., when they are new to the workforce and before children come along), and also when comparing wages by title, tenure and education level within a given field. But no matter how you slice and dice the data, there are very few scenarios in which women on average earn the same as men. Indeed, in its latest analysis of median weekly earnings last year by occupation, the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research found that women earned less than men not only in all 20 of the largest occupations for men but also in all 20 of the largest occupations for women. Among the largest occupations for women, the most egregious pay gaps were among financial managers (women earned 71% of every dollar a man earns), retail salesperson (72%), education and child care administrators (79%), administrative assistants (80%) and managers (81%). The narrowest gap was among cashiers, where women almost have pay parity (98%) with their male colleagues. Same old (and annoying) story every year While the overall gender pay gap has been narrowing over time \u2014 for example, Equal Pay Day in 2005 was April 19, a full five weeks later than this year\u2019s \u2014 the very fact that \ufeffsuch a gap exists at all in 2024 is a reminder that employers and society still have work to do in recognizing the value of women\u2019s contributions at work. \u201cThe gender wage gap is a national disgrace,\u201d said\u00a0Jamila Taylor, IWPR\u2019s president and CEO, in a statement. \u201cEven in professions typically dominated by women, men earn more for doing the same job. Equal pay for equal work has been the law of the land for more than a half-century, yet\u00a0women still cannot get fair treatment when it comes to employment and earnings. And it\u2019s worse for women of color, who face rampant racial discrimination in the workforce in addition to ongoing pay inequities.\u201d The good news is that there are now multiple efforts that may over time help reduce the problem. They include an increasing number of state-level pay transparency laws and bans on employers asking job candidates for their salary histories, which can help chronically underpaid women gain more of an equal footing when they apply for new jobs. There is also now a ban on federal government agencies asking job candidates\u2019 for their salary history and a proposed rule that would prohibit federal contractors from doing the same, as well as requiring them to post in their job ads the pay for given positions. But Vagins and others in the campaign for equal pay also want to see action at the federal legislative level, supporting two bills: the Salary Transparency Act and the Paycheck Fairness Act, which have been introduced in the US House and Senate multiple times. For instance, the Paycheck Fairness Act would, according to Equal Pay Today, \u201cbar retaliation against workers who voluntarily discuss or disclose their wages; close loopholes that have allowed employers to pay women less than men for the same work \u2026 [and] ensure women can receive the same robust remedies for sex-based pay discrimination that are currently available to those subjected to discrimination based on race and ethnicity.\u201d Absent such federal laws requiring all employers to make equal pay more of an imperative, Vagins said, achieving true pay parity for women will be slow in coming.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/12/success/equal-pay-day-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/23/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_17_media_alex-jones-infowars-shut-down", "text": "Alex Jones\u2019\u00a0notorious\u00a0conspiracy\u00a0platform Infowars may have survived a\u00a0key decision from a federal judge last week, but the platform\u2019s future is far from secure. A bankruptcy judge in Houston on Friday allowed Jones to liquidate his personal assets to help pay the nearly $1.5 billion that he owes the families of the Sandy Hook massacre victims but dismissed the\u00a0separate\u00a0bankruptcy\u00a0case\u00a0of Infowars\u2019 parent company Free Speech Systems. The dismissal is not a reflection on Jones or whatever the judge might feel about Infowars. Rather, it was a question of economic reality \u2013 how the judge could help the families get the most value out of Jones and Infowars. \u201cThis case is one of the more difficult cases I\u2019ve had,\u201d Judge Christopher\u00a0Lopez said during a lengthy and at times emotional ruling. \u201cI was never asked today to make a decision to shut down a show or not. That was never going to happen today one way or another.\u201d What the judge decided Lopez approved Jones\u2019 request to liquidate his personal assets to help pay off his debts, but dismissed a request to \u201cconvert\u201d Free Speech Systems\u2019 bankruptcy to liquidation. Some of the Sandy Hook families had requested the judge move to liquidate Jones\u2019 Free Speech Systems company. They\u00a0argued it would not only dismantle a platform that had caused so much agony but would also ensure a fair way to dole out the proceeds of a sell-off. But\u00a0a\u00a0handful of\u00a0other families had argued against liquidation. The reasoning: Liquidation is a lengthy and costly process, and the families have yet to see a dime from the more than a billion dollars Jones owes them. Lopez noted that this may be one of the longest-running cases of its kind in the country. Because the company is not in liquidation, the families can immediately go after Free Speech System\u2019s assets in state courts, a much faster and less costly process (liquidation would have involved various bankruptcy professionals who take a lot of fees). \u201cI have to do what\u2019s in the best interest of credito\ufeffrs,\u201d Lopez said on Friday, adding, \u201cWhen you look at it, I think creditors are better served in pursuing their state court rights.\u201d Since Jones is the owner of Free Speech Systems, and Jones himself is in bankruptcy, the families can go after the company\u2019s assets. In a sadly ironic twist, the more money Jones makes by broadcasting his lies and conspiracy theories on Infowars, the more of the nearly $1.5 billion he owes to the families could actually be paid. What happens to Infowars For now, nothing changes for Jones\u2019 Infowars shows. The company can continue operating, and Jones is free to say what he wants \u2013 including commenting about Sandy Hook \u2013 as he wishes. But Jones\u2019 personal stake in the company is part of his own personal liquidation. Because of Jones\u2019 bankruptcy, Free Speech Systems is now in the hands of a court-appointed trustee. It\u2019s not clear what that trustee will do - either keep Free Speech Systems operating or sell it off. \u201cI do not now own Infowars,\u201d Jones said during an \u201cemergency\u201d show on Saturday. \u201cIt is now controlled by the court trustee. I am the CEO and the decision maker.\u201d Jay Westbrook,\u00a0a University of Texas bankruptcy law professor, said\u00a0the personal bankruptcy trustee will take over Jones\u2019s interest in Free Speech Systems. \u201c(The trustee) will work to maximize the value of Jones\u2019s shares for the benefit of his creditors, including the possibility of selling Jones\u2019s shares,\u201d Westbrook said. Jones said on Saturday he estimates the company has up to five more months before some sort of sale. \u201cIf we make it a few more months\u2026 if we make it that, we\u2019ll survive, under new management and ownership but I\u2019ll still be as host here, I\u2019ll still be in control of what I say or I won\u2019t be here,\u201d Jones said on Saturday. \u201cBut we just got more runway. It\u2019s like in a video game where you\u2019re down to one life, you get another life.\u201d What happens next Still uncertain is what sort of power the court-appointed trustee has over Free Speech Systems. Lopez will likely schedule a new hearing to determine the trustee\u2019s powers. But no matter what happens to the company, Jones still owes nearly $1.5 billion. If Free Speech Systems continues operating and making money for Jones, those funds will ultimately need to go to paying the families. \u201cOnce Jones\u2019s bankruptcy case ends, the families can start to use state court collection tools (garnishment, attachment, foreclosure) to get paid from income that Jones earns and any property he acquires since he filed for bankruptcy until their judgments are paid in full,\u201d Marie Reilly, professor of bankruptcy law at Penn State University, told CNN. While Jones now acknowledges the Sandy Hook massacre took place, he is free to continue espousing dangerous rhetoric and conspiracy theories on his platforms.In recent days, Jones has fantasized on his show about executing\u00a0Dr. Anthony Fauci, the former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,\u00a0and others who supposedly \u201clied to\u00a0Trump.\u201d But even if Infowars is shut down, Jones can continue posting on his X account after it was restored last year by Elon Musk or join other high-profile platforms. Earlier this month, Tucker Carlson, the far-right former Fox News host, announced Jones would join him for a stop on his upcoming national live speaking tour. Days later, Jones was quietly dropped from the tour without explanation.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/media/alex-jones-infowars-shut-down/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/23/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_judges-stern-rebuke-of-elon-musks-x-gives-researchers-fresh-hope", "text": "A federal judge\u2019s decision this week reprimanding Elon Musk\u2019s X will have reverberating effects on efforts to hold influential online platforms accountable, legal experts and advocacy groups say. On Monday, District Judge Charles Breyer dismissed and excoriated a lawsuit by X against online watchdog group Center for Countering Digital Hate as an attempt to silence the non-profit group for sounding alarms about hate speech on the platform. Breyer wrote in Monday\u2019s order that the lawsuit was \u201cunabashedly\u201d about \u201cpunishing\u201d reports written by CCDH, which X had accused of campaigning to drive away its advertisers. Breyer held that the reports were \u201cunquestionably\u201d protected by the group\u2019s free speech rights. Now, that decision could embolden other research groups and Musk critics who have faced legal threats from the billionaire. The CCDH case \u2014 in the US District Court for the Northern District of California \u2014\u00a0has been widely viewed as a bellwether for research and accountability on X, where Musk has restored the accounts of previously banned White supremacists and spreaders of misinformation and where Musk himself has amplified various conspiracy theories. And CCDH is not the only organization that has faced attacks by self-proclaimed \u201cfree speech absolutist\u201d Musk after criticizing or raising concerns about his platform. \u201cThis is an important decision that sees Elon Musk\u2019s lawsuit for what it is \u2014 an effort to punish his critics for constitutionally protected speech and to deter researchers from studying his platform,\u201d said Alex Abdo, litigation director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, which had filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the case arguing that private companies should not be allowed to use breach of contract claims to punish criticism. \u201cSociety needs reliable and ethical research into social media platforms, and often that research relies on being able to study publicly available posts,\u201d Abdo said. X said it plans to appeal Breyer\u2019s decision. Musk\u2019s threats against X critics In his first year as owner of X, formerly known as Twitter, Musk threatened legal action against the Anti-Defamation League for defamation, as well as against Microsoft and Meta for allegedly improper data and trade secret access, respectively. None of those threats ever amounted to real lawsuits. He did, however, sue the progressive media watchdog Media Matters over its\u00a0analysis\u00a0highlighting antisemitic and pro-Nazi content on X, alleging that the group\u2019s testing methodology was not representative of how real users experience the site and that the report was designed to drive away advertisers. Legal experts have described that case as \u201cweak\u201d on the merits and as a \u201cbogus\u201d attempt to chill criticism of X. This week\u2019s court decision may be only a temporary setback in Musk\u2019s wider plan to stifle criticism, said Media Matters CEO Angelo Carusone. Musk\u2019s new playbook, Carusone said, enlists the help of sympathetic Republican attorneys general to investigate independent reporting organizations and tie them up in legal proceedings. The states of Texas and Missouri each announced probes into Media Matters following X\u2019s lawsuit against the group, to which Musk responded, \u201cGreat!\u201d As recently as Monday, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey filed a petition in state court seeking to compel Media Matters\u2019 cooperation with his investigation. The filing came a week after he appeared with Musk in a live event on X \u2014 which Carusone said shows how Musk hopes to deputize the power of government to silence his critics. \u201cThey have every reason to do it,\u201d Carusone said of the AGs\u2019 investigations. \u201cThey get the political benefits, they get the attention. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any cost to them yet. And if they are successful at developing this new playbook, this new terrain, legally, then it\u2019s going to pave the way for them to just use this tool and tactic over and over and over again.\u201d A representative for X did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Carusone\u2019s claims. Researchers face hurdles to studying on-platform behavior Researchers from non-profits and academic institutions have had a harder time studying X since Musk\u2019s takeover in 2022. Academics need large samples of posts, shares, likes and other data to study social media trends in mis- and disinformation, public health, elections and other key topics. But one of Musk\u2019s first changes at X was to put access to platform data behind a steep paywall. Researchers and civil society groups said the new subscription fees \u2014 costing up to $2.5 million a year \u2014\u00a0were \u201coutrageously expensive\u201d and made it impossible to do their work, reducing transparency of a critical platform. The change may have forced some researchers to rely more heavily on first-person observational data to draw conclusions about user behavior on X. Groups like CCDH have also used automated \u201cscraping\u201d of publicly viewable content from X rather than paying the company for data directly, a tactic that helped give rise to X\u2019s initial lawsuit. Efforts by X and other social media companies to limit research transparency makes them less accountable to the public at best and, at worst, could mask malicious behavior, said David Karpf, an associate professor in the School of Media and Public Affairs at George Washington University. \u201cWe need independent research to have any real measure of what\u2019s going on at X/Twitter. Musk is only ever going to release data that makes his company look good,\u201d Karpf said. \u201cThese platforms are too big and too vital to the spread of information to be left unmonitored.\u201d \u201cThis is an election year,\u201d Karpf added, \u201cand the platforms are taking steps to make it harder to monitor how their services are used for malignant ends.\u201d Free Press, another media accountability organization that has been critical of Musk\u2019s leadership of X and which called for advertisers to pause their spending on the platform shortly after his takeover, also celebrated Breyer\u2019s ruling as potentially removing at least one hurdle that watchdog organizations face. \u201cThe guardrails for democracy are hanging by a thread and we have dwindling insights into platform practices as researchers face lawsuits, congressional subpoenas and other scare tactics,\u201d said Nora Benavidez, senior counsel and director of digital rights at Free Press. Ultimately, Benavidez called the ruling \u201ca reminder that platform accountability is essential and will inevitably prevail when up against bullies like Musk who try to silence us.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/judges-stern-rebuke-of-elon-musks-x-gives-researchers-fresh-hope/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/23/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_15_success_best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund", "text": "The average federal tax refund is more than $3,000, according to the latest data from the IRS. Since the majority of tax filers get a refund, there\u2019s a fair chance you could get hundreds if not thousands of dollars back in overpaid taxes, especially if you\u2019re also owed a refund from your state government. That money may feel like a windfall, and it\u2019s easy to squander it on a lot of little things. But if you\u2019re looking to improve your current financial situation, here are seven ideas to consider. Well, technically six, but you\u2019ll enjoy the seventh the most. 1. Pay off high-rate debt If you are carrying a balance on your credit card and are paying 20% to 30% in interest, make this your first priority to pay down. At such sky-high rates, \u201cthe debt can grow faster than you can pay it off,\u201d said Eric Bronnenkant, a certified financial planner and head of tax at Betterment, a robo-advisory financial services firm that also has a human advice team on hand to help clients. Keyana Russ, a certified financial planner at Four Ponds Financial Planning, concurred that people\u2019s awareness of how much money they\u2019re paying in interest over time doesn\u2019t always register. \u201cWhat I usually see is people paying the minimum, or they\u2019re charging everyday expenses and not paying off the bill at the end of the month. \u2026 They don\u2019t understand how much interest they\u2019re paying,\u201d Russ said. For example, if you\u2019re carrying a $3,000 balance at 27% interest and you only pay a required minimum of $97.50 every month, it will take you 240 months (which is 20 years) just to pay off the $3,000 \u2014 and, in addition, you will have paid $3,044.57 in interest, for a total of $6,044.57, according to Bankrate.com\u2019s calculator. 2. Create or add to an emergency fund You can use your refund to start or bolster an emergency fund. When it comes to costly emergencies, there are many Americans who don\u2019t have at least three months\u2019 worth of living expenses set aside, let alone enough to easily handle an unexpected bill of $1,000. Be sure to stash the money in a high-yield savings account at an FDIC-insured bank, Russ suggested, noting that the best interest rates are typically offered by online banks. If you have high-rate debt and you\u2019re lacking emergency savings, Russ suggested you might use a portion of your refund to attack your debt and the other portion to create an emergency fund. Bronnenkant favors paying off the high-rate debt first, but, if you\u2019re low on emergency savings and need a critical repair to help keep your job \u2014 such as on your car \u2014 he said it might make sense to set aside money for that repair and put the rest toward your credit card or other high-rate debt. 3. Make an extra payment on your mortgage If you\u2019re carrying a mortgage at a high rate (e.g., 7% to 8%), and you\u2019re not saddled with credit card debt, you might consider making an extra payment or two. \u201cIt can make a difference in the long run towards your principal,\u201d Russ said.\u00a0 You can even view it as an additional form of savings, in the sense that you\u2019re saving yourself an extra 7% \ufeffor so in interest on the portion of the principal you\u2019re paying down, Bronnenkant noted. 4. Invest in a Roth IRA If your income qualifies you to contribute to a Roth IRA, you can contribute up to $7,000 this year ($8,000 if you\u2019re at least 50) with after-tax savings. That money will grow untaxed until retirement, at which point your withdrawals will be tax-free and penalty-free after age 59-1/2, assuming the account has been open for at least five years. (And note: You can still make a 2023 Roth contribution until April 15 this year. The contribution limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if you\u2019re age 50 or older. Bolstering your tax-free retirement savings is great.\u00a0But if you need to access some of your money well before you retire, you may take out any part of your contributions tax-free and penalty-free at any time, \ufeffBronnenkant said. You would only be taxed and penalized if you withdrew the earnings on your contributions before age 59-1/2. (For more information on Roth IRA withdrawal rules, here is an easy-to-understand rundown from Charles Schwab.) 5. Contribute enough to your 401(k) in 2024 to get your full employer match Speaking of retirement savings, if you\u2019re not yet contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match from your employer, a refund can make that easier. Say you get $3,000 back. You can put that money in a high-yield savings account to earn interest. Then, on your workplace 401(k) site, change your paycheck contribution levels so that by the end of the year you will have contributed $3,000 more in pre-tax money than you otherwise would have. For instance, say you\u2019re paid every two weeks and you have 20 more paychecks left until the end of the year. You can boost you biweekly contributions by $150 per paycheck ($150 x 20 = $3,000). \u201cYou want to get the max match from your employer,\u201d Bronnenkant said. 6. Invest for shorter-term goals If in the next three to 10 years you expect to buy a home, take a once-in-a-lifetime trip, renovate a room, send your kids to summer camp or have any other expensive goal, you might consider investing your refund in a diversified mix of low-cost, broad market index funds. The shorter term your goal is, the less risk you want to take. If you need the money within three years, you might consider putting your refund in certificates of deposits and US Treasury bonds. But if your goal is five to 10 years out, and you\u2019re comfortable taking on some more risk and are willing to accept fluctuations in the market, Bronnenkant said, you might put no more than 30% of your refund in a stock index fund and 70% in a total market bond fund if your risk tolerance is conservative; or 50% in each if you have a moderate risk tolerance. If you plan on sending your child to college and you have a 529 plan, you can use your refund to boost your contributions to that plan, Russ said. You may also get a tax break for your contribution depending on the state where you live. 7. Have some fun Unless you\u2019re in truly dire financial straits, if you get a large refund, you might set aside a small portion to do whatever you truly enjoy. \u201cSometimes you just want to have fun and not have it be all business,\u201d Russ said. \u201cYou can set aside some of the money to have fun.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/15/success/best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/23/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_media_nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash", "text": "Cesar Conde has a decision to make \u2014 and it\u2019s not an especially difficult one. The NBCUniversal News Group chair is facing a torrent of backlash from his own staff after greenlighting the hire of former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel as a paid network contributor. Over the last 24 hours, the most prominent and recognizable NBC News and MSNBC personalities have voiced strong displeasure with the company\u2019s decision to welcome McDaniel to \u201cthe team.\u201d And they\u2019re not doing it via anonymous comments to the press. They\u2019re doing it on the record on NBCU\u2019s own air. Chuck Todd broke the dam on Sunday\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with a set of candid comments about the hiring, and Rachel Maddow capped the flood of backlash Monday night with a blistering 30-minute monologue eviscerating the network\u2019s leadership for the \u201cinexplicable\u201d move. Suffice to say, NBCU News Group is in unprecedented territory. Never has a network\u2019s C-suite ever been so thoroughly flogged by its most high-profile stars in such no holds barred fashion. Saying that Conde simply has a crisis on his hands would be a contender for understatement of the year. It\u2019s a five-alarm fire at NBCU News Group, and one of Conde\u2019s own making. While NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown were most directly responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring, a decision that MSNBC boss Rashida Jones did not object to it at the time, the buck ultimately stops with Conde, who hold the real power at the Peacock Network. McDaniel\u2019s hiring could not have happened without Conde\u2019s blessing. It does not take a brilliant political mind with prescient foresight to understand that hiring McDaniel would ignite a firestorm of outrage \u2014 from both within 30 Rock and outside it. Conde, someone who ostensibly supports American democracy, should have rejected McDaniel\u2019s hiring on the grounds that NBCU News Group could not put someone on its payroll who tried to subvert the 2020 vote. As so many of NBCU\u2019s staffers have underscored, the objection to McDaniel is not that she is a Republican. It\u2019s not even that she is a Donald Trump-supporting Republican. It\u2019s that she was an active participant in the plot to overthrow the last presidential election. That is not to even mention McDaniel\u2019s years of demonizing the press, smearing the journalists who work at NBC News and MSNBC as she sought to destroy the credibility of the organization that she ran to after being chased out of the RNC. The notion put forward by NBC that it needed to hire McDaniel to bring its viewers \u201can insider\u2019s perspective on national politics and the future of the Republican Party\u201d is absurd. If that\u2019s the case, the network should move to hire free agents like Tucker Carlson or Candace Owens. They too have their hands on the pulse of the Republican Party. In fact, they represent much more of where the GOP stands today than McDaniel. So, using NBC\u2019s logic, why not hire them? (Spoiler: News organizations rightfully have established basic standards for paid contributors. Asking that your employees have a commitment to democracy, to the truth, and to basic decency is not a big ask.) But even if Conde has no allegiance to basic democratic principles, which this hire calls into question, given that he is known to be a political player who cares deeply about his own image in the press, he should have been wise enough to foresee that hiring McDaniel would be an ill-conceived move. How this did not occur to Conde is unfathomable and shows a tremendous lack of judgment. Even more bizarre is Conde\u2019s management, or lack thereof, since the controversy erupted. It was clear early on that his employees at NBC News and MSNBC did not support McDaniel\u2019s hiring. If that was not evident on Friday, it was clear as day on Sunday after \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d The network\u2019s employees were not only flabbergasted and demoralized by the move, but absolutely enraged by it. At that point, the writing should have been on the wall for Conde \u2014 as it was for every other media executive that I have spoken with over the last 24 hours. It is evident that McDaniel has no real future as an NBC analyst and the decision to bring her on as a contributor will have to be reversed. After all, which NBC or MSNBC program is going to invite her on after all of this? The only real question for Conde after the Sunday morning scolding should have been how he chose to back out of the deal in the least painful way possible. To be fully honest, I very much expected a Sunday evening announcement from NBC, one that would have earned praise from the company\u2019s staff and quickly been swept away by the rush of Trump news Monday morning. But no such announcement came. Instead, Conde has allowed the mess to spiral absolutely out of control. MSNBC\u2019s top stars hammered the network\u2019s leadership throughout the day Monday over the hire. NBC News\u2019 Guild blasted Conde, saying in a statement that under him the company had quietly laid off employees over the last month and instead chosen to \u201cprioritize an election denier over its reporters.\u201d The already severe crisis was allowed to blossom into one of the worst corporate public relations catastrophes in recent memory. All the while, Conde has remained silent. I asked his spokesperson, Stephen Labaton, on Monday whether the NBCU News Group boss had any comment on the situation. Does he have any regret? I didn\u2019t get an on-the-record response. Suffice to say, however, that what Conde does moving forward will say a lot about his character and commitment to democratic values. It will also say a lot about the NBCU News Group and what type of organization it is. In her biting monologue on Monday night, however, Maddow did offer Conde a way out of this mess. \u201cMistakes will be made,\u201d Maddow said.\u201dBut our resilience as a democracy is going to be recognizing when decisions are bad ones and reversing those bad decisions. Hearing legitimate criticism, responding to it, and correcting course. Not digging in. Not blaming others. Take a minute. Acknowledge that maybe it wasn\u2019t the right call.\u201d \u201cIt is a sign of strength, not weakness, to acknowledge when you are wrong,\u201d Maddow added. \u201cIt is a sign of strength. And our country needs us to be strong now.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/media/nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/23/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_21_opinions_sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic", "text": "The biggest tech news this week is the\u00a0ouster\u00a0of Sam Altman from his role as CEO of OpenAI, a move that has shaken the company and the industry. Hundreds of OpenAI employees have threatened to\u00a0resign. Altman has already\u00a0moved on\u00a0to a role at Microsoft. And OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is on its\u00a0third CEO\u00a0in as many days. It\u2019s all very juicy. But this drama should also be raising larger questions, far beyond one company\u2019s internal hirings and firings, including: Who are the people making the decisions\u00a0that will determine so much of our technological future? What guiding principles are they using to make those decisions? And how should other institutions \u2013 governments, non-tech industries, global alliances, regulatory bodies \u2013 reign in the worst excesses of potentially dangerous AI innovators? OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, with an explicit mission to harness what may soon be superhuman intelligence \u201cto benefit humanity as a whole.\u201d But that sensibility hasn\u2019t lasted. The company now has a multi-billion-dollar for-profit arm. They have been developing new technologies at lightning speed, and sometimes sending them out to the public\u00a0before some employees believed they were ready. The company has already reportedly invented an AI technology so dangerous they will never release it \u2013 but they also\u00a0won\u2019t tell\u00a0reporters or the public exactly what it is. This dynamic \u2013 a potentially dangerous technology developed at extreme speed, largely behind closed doors \u2013 is partly to blame for Altman\u2019s firing. The OpenAI board, according to\u00a0CNN\u2019s David Goldman, worried that \u201cthe company was making the technological equivalent of a nuclear bomb, and its caretaker, Sam Altman, was moving so fast that he risked a global catastrophe.\u201d At particular issue seemed to be Altman\u2019s efforts to make the tools behind ChatGPT available to anyone who wanted to make their own version of the chatbot. This could be widely disastrous, some board members worried. But then they fired him without warning, and apparently without involving Microsoft, the company\u2019s largest shareholder. Now, Altman is at the new AI group at Microsoft, and one has to wonder if the oversight and caution there will be on par with that at OpenAI, or if he\u2019ll be handed carte blanche to push as fast and hard as he wants. And for all the justified reticence of the OpenAI board, the company has carried out much of its work in secrecy \u2013 without the public really understanding what a handful of unaccountable technologists are building, and how it is nearly guaranteed to indelibly change their lives. AI is broadly understood to have the potential to reshape vast swaths of human existence. At the very least, it seems nearly guaranteed to change how we process information, how we communicate, how we learn and how we work (and if we work). And the ramifications could be much more extreme. AI technologies have already demonstrated the ability\u00a0to lie and to cover their tracks. They have already been able to\u00a0suggest the design\u00a0to make a virus spread more quickly. Many researchers\u00a0acutely understand\u00a0just how quickly these machines could develop the capacity to annihilate us, including Altman: He has a prepper\u2019s paradise prepared in Big Sur, complete with guns and \u201cgas masks from the Israeli Defense Force\u201d in case AI goes off the rails and the robots go to war against humans,\u00a0according to reporting in the New Yorker. But don\u2019t worry, he told an Atlantic reporter: If AI is determined to wipe us out, \u201cno gas mask is helping anyone.\u201d (If you want an excellent and terrifying rundown of AI\u2019s risks \u2013 at least those we understand right now, which are almost certainly a mere sliver of the looming perils \u2013\u00a0the Atlantic profile of Altman and his technology\u00a0is worth a read). AI is very exciting technology. But it is also a potentially very dangerous one, and not in the social media sense of \u201cit may give us bad self-esteem and make us lonelier\u201d but in the sense of \u201cit could break down human societies and kill us all.\u201d Given the life-altering potential of AI \u2013 that even if it doesn\u2019t kill us all, it will almost certainly change human existence in unprecedented ways at unprecedented speed \u2013 we all have a stake in how it\u2019s being developed. And yet the development is being left to a handful of people (who seem to be\u00a0largely\u00a0men) in Silicon Valley, and other tech pockets around the globe. And we all have a stake in whose interests AI will serve \u2013 and right now, its development is being funded with billions of dollars by people expecting to make a huge profit. Do the interests of the public align with the interests of the shareholders to whom profit-driven, potentially tremendously lucrative-for-a-few companies are beholden? Or with the interests of tech entrepreneurs who are primarily excited about being at the forefront of the AI revolution, regardless of the potential human costs? One thing is clear: AI is coming. And how it is built and unleashed on the public matters more than perhaps any technology of the past century. It is, indeed, up there with the atom bomb in its destructive potential \u2013 except likely more difficult to regulate and control. \u201cRegulation\u201d does not begin to scratch the surface of what\u2019s needed to make sure that the AI future is not a catastrophic one, especially since the development of AI is now a massive international arms race, with particularly horrific implications if bad actors develop this technology first. But regulation is, at minimum, a necessary step. So is transparency: In the US, companies have wide leverage to work behind a veil of secrecy, and much of what AI companies do is kept secret to stymy competition. But the public certainly has a right to understand what life-altering technologies are set to be inflicted upon us, and what the creators are doing to protect humanity \u2013 our jobs, our communities, our families, our connections, our educations and our abilities to build a life of purpose, but also our lives and our safety. The Altman story is fascinating because Altman is the most powerful figure in AI technology, which in effect makes him one of the most powerful men in the world. But that should give us pause: Who is he, what power does he hold, what is he doing with it, who does he answer to, and are we comfortable with this much life-altering potential being held by a few unaccountable people?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/21/opinions/sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/23/2024", "section": "business"}}

The S&P 500 index has climbed nearly 15% this year and clinched 30 record-high closes. Strong corporate earnings and the artificial intelligence helped drive stocks higher at the start of this year, despite a slew of hotter-than-expected inflation reports that fueled concerns the Federal Reserve would be slow to cut interest rates in 2024. Then, fresh data in May revealed last week that inflation is cooling again and getting closer to the Fed\u2019s 2% target. The central bank at its June policy meeting held rates steady and penciled in one cut for 2024. After waffling over whether the Fed would ease monetary policy at all in 2024, traders are now betting on two to three cuts, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. The new backdrop of cooling inflation coupled with rate cuts on the horizon is prompting investors to up their bullish wagers. Goldman Sachs on Friday raised its year-end target for the benchmark index to 5,600 from 5,200, citing a strong outlook for corporate profits. That would be a 2.3% advance from Monday\u2019s close. Evercore ISI raised its price target to 6,000 for the S&P 500, a reversal from its previous, more gloomy 4,750 target. That higher level would be a 9.6% jump from Monday\u2019s close. \u201cThe backdrop of slowing inflation, a Fed intent on cutting rates and steady growth have supported Goldilocks,\u201d wrote Julian Emanuel, a senior managing director at Evercore ISI, in a Sunday note. \u201cThe rally has room.\u201d The market has also been distinguished by uncharacteristic calm. Stock sell-offs have been short and shallow. The S&P 500 has had its longest stretch of trading days without a 2% or more decline since February 2018, according to SoFi data as of June 12. While low volatility sounds like a positive, it\u2019s not without danger. It suggests that investors are taking on more risk in their portfolios due to an overly optimistic view and could be caught flat-footed if the tide turns. There\u2019s no shortage of risks that could unnerve markets in the coming months. Much of the S&P 500 index\u2019s returns are tied to the mega-cap tech Magnificent Seven stocks, leaving the market dependent on just a handful of names to continue its monster run. Stocks could also wobble leading up to the US presidential election in November. Some investors warn that despite encouraging economic data, a recession could still be in the cards for 2024 or next year. Despite its more bullish baseline target, Goldman Sachs warned that the S&P 500 index could end the year at 4,800, a 12.3% drop from current levels, if economic growth data turns sour and markets price in higher odds of a recession. The strange economics of pig meat: Ham prices are down, but bacon\u2019s up Shoppers in the meat aisle may have noticed something weird last month: Bacon prices are sizzling, but ham\u2019s not so hot, reports my colleague Danielle Wiener-Bronner. Bacon is more expensive than it was a year ago, with prices up 6.9% from May 2023 to May of this year, according to inflation data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Pork chops were up too, by 4.6%. But ham prices were lower, falling 5.4% overall and dropping 6.3% when you exclude canned varieties. What gives? Econ buffs may remember that prices are set according to supply and demand. You\u2019d expect any supply issues \u2014 like too many hogs, or too few \u2014 to cause prices of each of the items to move up or down, all in the same direction. The discrepancy, then, must be caused by differences on the demand side. And it is: Demand for domestic pork has grown in recent years outside of the US. But rising demand, plus the same or reduced supply, should push prices up, not down. So again, what gives? To understand you have to zoom out, looking at long-term retail pricing strategy and food price trends.

Then, he was told the purchase might get him prison time, reports my colleague Samantha Delouya. \u201cThat was really shocking to me. It\u2019s just purchasing property,\u201d Bian, who is originally from Nanjing, China, said. \u201cOnce I learned that, I didn\u2019t even bother to look anymore.\u201d Bian, a 31-year-old software engineer who has lived in the US for 12 years, is a recipient of an H-1B visa, which allows companies to employ foreign workers. For nearly a year, however, it has been a crime for him to purchase a home in Florida after the state\u2019s governor, Ron DeSantis, signed a law restricting Chinese nationals without US green cards from purchasing property in the state. Bian and other Florida residents told CNN that the rules have fostered uneasiness and confusion among ethnic Chinese people living in the state. Some say the law has damaged their businesses, while others say they are considering abandoning Florida altogether. And the law underscores the heightened tensions between the two biggest economies in the world in a US presidential election year. Bian said that lately, he had begun reconsidering his life in Florida. He isn\u2019t alone. Ever since Florida Senate Bill 264 went into effect on July 1, 2023, Chinese citizens without green cards face a felony charge and possible prison time if they purchase property in the state. Sellers and real estate agents can also be found liable under the law.

{"id": "2024_06_21_business_teamsters-president-speaking-republican-convention-trump", "text": "Teamsters President Sean O\u2019Brien will speak to the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee in July, a sign that former President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign is hoping to peel off the support of union members from President Joe Biden. But unlike other speakers at the RNC, O\u2019Brien\u2019s appearance does not represent an endorsement of Trump, according to Teamsters union spokesperson Kara Deniz. O\u2019Brien has requested the opportunity to also speak at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August. The DNC has yet to accept that request, Deniz said. Trump posted the announcement Friday afternoon on his Truth Social platform. \u201cOur GREAT convention will unify Americans and demonstrate to the nation\u2019s working families they come first,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cWhen I am back in the White House, the hardworking Teamsters, and all working Americans, will once again have a country they can afford to live in and be respected around the world. Sean, I look forward to seeing you represent the Teamsters in Milwaukee. Together we can Make America Great Again.\u201d Deniz said in an email that the union was happy Trump extended the invitation. \u201cThis is truly unprecedented since it will be the very first time a Teamsters General President has addressed the RNC,\u201d she said in an email. \u201cOur 1.3 million members\u00a0represent every political background, and their message needs to be heard by as wide an audience as possible, and that includes all political candidates running for elected office. We appreciate former President Trump\u2019s openness to inviting a labor leader to speak on behalf of working families.\u201d \u201cWe sincerely hope the DNC will also respond to our request with an invitation,\u201d she said. Trump and O\u2019Brien met at the former president\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort in early January. Trump then met with the union\u2019s leadership on January 31. Some other union leaders objected to the meetings, with John Palmer \u2014 the group\u2019s international vice president at-large \u2014 writing a letter at that time denouncing Trump as \u201ca known union buster, scab, and insurrectionist.\u201d \u201cWe should never entertain dialogue with a candidate with such an anti-union record,\u201d he wrote. Biden has a very pro-union record. He became the first sitting president to appear on the picket line to support strikers during the United Auto Workers union\u2019s strike against the nation\u2019s three unionized automakers. He has regularly voiced support for unions and has appointed a very pro-union leadership to the National Labor Relations Board, which has been much friendlier to union positions during his administration. He also met with the Teamsters leadership in March. But so far, the Teamsters have endorsed neither candidate, unlike the AFL-CIO and many powerful unions, such as the UAW and the National Education Association. And the union\u2019s political arm gave similar size donations of hundreds of thousands of dollars to committees of both the Democratic and Republican parties earlier this year. O\u2019Brien has had his own harsh criticism of some other Republicans, if not Trump. At a Senate hearing in November, he and Sen. Markwayne Mullin, a Republican from Oklahoma, both said they were prepared to engage in a fist fight in the middle of a hearing until Sen. Bernie Sanders, the committee chair, ordered them to stop. The DNC said it has yet to settle on its set of speakers for its convention in August. \u201cWe are building a convention in Chicago that will tell our story to the American people, including the stories of labor and union leaders and workers that President Biden has been delivering\u00a0for as the most pro-union president in modern history,\u201d said DNC spokesperson Matt Hill. \u2013 CNN\u2019s Gregory Krieg and Kristen Holmes contributed to this report", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/business/teamsters-president-speaking-republican-convention-trump/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/23/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_21_media_robert-winnett-washington-post", "text": "The Washington Post said Friday that Robert Winnett, the British journalist who had been slated to take over as the newspaper\u2019s top editor, will no longer join the publication that has been ensnared in a weeks-long crisis over ethics questions. \u201cIt is with regret that I share with you that Robert Winnett has withdrawn from the position of Editor at The Washington Post,\u201d Will Lewis, The Post\u2019s embattled publisher and chief executive, told staff in a Friday morning memo. Winnett, who had been tapped this month by Lewis to join The Post following the November election, will now remain deputy editor of London\u2019s Telegraph newspaper. The decision comes after Winnett\u2019s journalistic integrity was questioned in a 3,000-word front page expose published by The Post, which reported that Winnett had previously used materials from a self-described \u201cthief\u201d for reporting. The news Winnett will no longer join The Post comes as the Jeff Bezos-owned publication remains engulfed in turmoil over serious journalistic ethics questions facing Lewis, the former Rupert Murdoch lieutenant who has been accused of helping the right-wing media mogul cover up for senior executives in a decade-old UK phone hacking scandal. Lewis has denied wrongdoing but recently attempted to suppress stories on the matter, according to private accounts from Sally Buzbee, the former executive editor of The Post, and NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik. The allegations have been revived by a lawsuit from Prince Harry and other high-profile figures, in a case which is scheduled to be adjudicated in court early next year. Amid questions about Lewis\u2019 role in the phone hacking scandal, additional reporting has raised concerns about his journalistic integrity at large. The Guardian published a story this week accusing Lewis of having once advised then-U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson to \u201cclean up\u201d his phone during the so-called \u201cPartygate\u201d scandal. Lewis and Johnson denied the report. Inside The Post\u2019s newsroom, morale has plunged as staffers express alarm over Lewis\u2019 conduct and worries over the future direction of the newspaper under his leadership. Interviews with nearly a dozen Post staffers and others familiar with the internal dynamics of the newspaper this week revealed a workforce that has grown increasingly dismayed by the situation, with some searching for work elsewhere. Patience has also worn thin for owner Bezos, who has yet to address the crisis in a meaningful way. In a short memo to top newsroom leadership Tuesday, Bezos reiterated his commitment to \u201cvery high\u201d standards, but has yet to take any meaningful action to quell his newsroom\u2019s anger. A spokesperson for Bezos did not respond to requests for comment on Thursday when asked if the Amazon billionaire planned to take any additional steps to right the ship. Thus far, Bezos has tepidly signaled that he is supporting his controversy-plagued publisher, whom he installed into the top role at The Post in January. A new search begins Lewis told staffers in his Friday memo that he will \u201cimmediately launch a new search\u201d for a new editor. Lewis said that Matt Murray, the former top editor at The Wall Street Journal who was brought in to take over on an interim basis after Lewis ousted Buzbee, will continue in his role. Lewis\u2019 memo, laying out The Post\u2019s future plans, suggested he will remain at the newspaper, despite concerns from staffers. This week, two Pulitzer Prize-winning Post journalists went on the record, calling for leadership changes at the newspaper. \u201cI don\u2019t know a single person at the Post who thinks the current situation with the publisher and supposed new editor can stand,\u201d David Maraniss, an associate editor who has worked at The Post for nearly five decades and won two Pulitzer Prizes at the newspaper, wrote in a candid Facebook post. \u201cThere might be a few, but very very few.\u201d Maraniss also zinged Bezos, writing that he is \u201cnot of and for the Post or he would understand.\u201d Scott Higham, another Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist at The Post, echoed Maraniss\u2019 call for Lewis to exit the newspaper. \u201cWill Lewis needs to step down for the good of The Post and the public,\u201d Higham replied in a comment on Maraniss\u2019 post. \u201cHe has lost the newsroom and will never win it back.\u201d Independent corporate governance experts have also said Lewis should be shown the door. Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, the professor and senior associate dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management, told CNN on Monday that Bezos should dismiss Lewis. Sonnenfeld, who has advised US presidents and scores of corporate leaders, said that if he were advising Bezos, he would tell him Lewis has \u201clost legitimacy to lead\u201d and it\u2019s time to \u201cclean the house.\u201d \u201cThis is a tragic meltdown of the conscience of American journalism bringing shame to the Katharine Graham, Ben Bradlee, Marty Baron legacy of collaboration, courage and integrity,\u201d Sonnenfeld said. \u201cBezos must recruit an accomplished, experienced editor whom journalists admire and trust.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments and context.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/media/robert-winnett-washington-post/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/23/2024", "section": "business"}}

The conference, which is widely anticipated each year as a major showcase for Apple software news, will run Monday, June 10 through Friday, June 14. Although last year\u2019s WWDC focused on the unveiling of the Vision Pro mixed reality headset, which launched in stores in February, this year is expected to turn to Apple\u2019s AI efforts. The company is reportedly interested in licensing and building Google\u2019s Gemini AI engine, which includes chatbots and other AI tools, into upcoming iPhones and its iOS 18 features. As more tech companies pour billions of dollars into the development and rollout of artificial intelligence, Apple has largely been left out of the conversation, with many other tech companies making big strides in the space. A partnership with Google would catapult Apple into the growing AI arms race. Apple researchers also recently said they\u2019ve developed a family of multimodal models \u2014 which refers to an AI system that can interpret and generate different types of data, such as text and images at the same time \u2014 called MM1. A report from those researchers said those new methods boast \u201csuperior abilities\u201d and can offer advanced reasoning and in-context learning to respond to text and images.

{"id": "2024_06_21_tech_apple-ai-chatgpt-ban-china", "text": "Apple is banking on its upcoming AI features to boost iPhone sales especially in China, where demand has been lagging. But there\u2019s a problem: ChatGPT \u2014 soon to be integrated into Siri \u2014 is banned in China. In a presentation earlier this month, Apple (AAPL) showed off its proprietary technology called Apple Intelligence to power compelling new AI features and announced a partnership with OpenAI to also use its viral ChatGPT tool in a limited capacity. (When Siri is activated and needs more assistance answering an inquiry, ChatGPT can step in.) The move signaled how Apple is trying to expedite the latest buzzy technology at a time when tech rivals, such as Microsoft, Google, Meta and Samsung, have already found their AI footing. A deal with OpenAI could help Apple close the gap. But China is one of the first countries in the world to regulate the generative AI technology that powers these popular services. In August, the Cyberspace Administration of China, the country\u2019s top internet watchdog, rolled out new guidelines for the industry, requiring companies to seek approval before deployment. The organization has approved more than 100 AI models as of March, all from Chinese companies. According to a report from the Wall Street Journal Thursday, Apple is looking for a Chinese AI company to partner with ahead of the iPhone\u2019s expected September launch, but it hasn\u2019t reached a deal yet. Apple did not respond to a request for comment. The need to find a partner \u2014 and quickly \u2014 comes at a time when Apple\u2019s smartphone sales tumbled a stunning 10% in the first quarter of this year, according to market research firm IDC, due largely to iPhone sales sharply dropping in China. The company has lost momentum in China as nationalism, a rough economy and increased competition have also hurt sales. China is the company\u2019s second-largest market. Trouble in the EU Limitations on its new AI tools may not be specific to China. In a statement sent to CNN following the publication of this article, Apple said it \u201chighly motivated\u201d to bring the features to customers around the world, but it is facing regulatory challenges in the European Union, as well. The company said it doesn\u2019t believe it will be able to roll out its AI features in Europe this year. \u201cDue to the regulatory uncertainties brought about by the Digital Markets Act (DMA), we do not believe that we will be able to roll out three of these features\u2014iPhone Mirroring, SharePlay Screen Sharing enhancements, and Apple Intelligence\u2014to our EU users this year,\u201d a spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cSpecifically, we are concerned that the interoperability requirements of the DMA could force us to compromise the integrity of our products in ways that risk user privacy and data security,\u201d it added. \u201cWe are committed to collaborating with the European Commission in an attempt to find a solution that would enable us to deliver these features to our EU customers without compromising their safety.\u201d Resurgent competitors In China, concerns around iPhone sales continue to mount as Chinese smartphone brand Huawei\u2019s smartphone sales growth was 70% in the first quarter, according to Counterpoint Research. If a solution is not worked out by fall, Chinese consumers may feel short changed and choose to wait until they can get the full AI experience with Apple, she added. \u201cApple is very likely to seek a local partner in China in place of OpenAI, because simply put, it needs to,\u201d said Nabila Popal, a senior director at IDC Research. \u201cChinese consumers are expecting\u00a0their premium phones to have the latest AI functionality and may\u00a0hesitate to spend over $1000 for devices that don\u2019t have all the AI bells and whistles.\u201d \u201cThe real growth in China for Apple will come in the long term, as Apple Intelligence evolves offering more use cases, extends language support beyond English and when Siri can leverage other local AI models to provide the ChatGPT-like function,\u201d Popal said. In the meantime, some AI companies in China may be better suited to target its consumers anyway, such as by offering more local dialects than what\u2019s currently found in foreign AI models, Reece Hayden, an analyst at ABI Research, noted. Apple wouldn\u2019t be the first foreign company to work with the Cyberspace Administration of China for AI and smartphones. In January, Samsung teamed up with Chinese tech giant Baidu (BIDU) to use its AI model to help power its translation service. It works with another AI firm Meitu for photo editing tools. In other parts of the world, Samsung uses its own propriety AI technology, along with Google\u2019s (GOOGL) AI model Gemini, which is also banned in China. Samsung, however, accounts for less than 1% of the total market in China, according to Counterpoint Research. Although the clock is ticking for Apple to secure a partnership ahead of its fall software launch, Jeff Fieldhack, a research director at Counterpoint, believes it will be able to ink a deal in time. \u201cApple should be able to have a partnership aligned very quickly because it has such a strong global install base, and it would be a gem for these companies to work with them,\u201d he said, noting that they\u2019d soon be established as an an AI power player in the country.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/tech/apple-ai-chatgpt-ban-china/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/23/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_21_business_china-local-government-tax-crackdown-intl-hnk", "text": "Authorities in cash-strapped Chinese cities are chasing companies for taxes dating back years, and in some cases decades, as they try to plug a hole blown in their finances by the real estate crisis. At least eight major listed companies in China have disclosed that they\u2019ve received demands to pay historical taxes, in one case going as far back as the 1990s, in a development that has caused an uproar online and damaged already fragile business confidence. V V Food & Beverage, the country\u2019s largest soy milk producer, said last week that one of its subsidiaries had received a demand for payment totaling 85 million yuan ($11.7 million) from the government of Zhijiang city in the central province of Hubei. The Zhijiang tax bureau said it recently found that the company had failed to file tax returns for 16 years from 1994 to 2009, the company said in a June 12 statement. The beverage maker isn\u2019t the only one to fall foul of the apparent tax crackdown. At least seven other listed companies have reported similar demands over the past few months. In some cases, the companies have had to suspend production and lay off workers because they couldn\u2019t absorb the hefty tax bills and penalties. The crackdown suggests local governments are searching for another way to fill their coffers, as they struggle under mounting financial stress because of a persistent property slump and economic weakness. The authorities have also publicized efforts to work more closely with police to find tax offenders, which has caused even more alarm. \u201cLocal governments in China are facing intense pressure to meet revenue targets, especially amidst economic slowdowns and broader fiscal challenges,\u201d said Craig Singleton, senior China fellow at the non-partisan Foundation for Defense of Democracies. Regional governments have long relied on land sales as a major source of revenue, which are used to pay for everything from roads to healthcare. But a real estate crisis since 2021 has diminished that source of funding. Over the past year, local governments have turned to extraordinary measures to raise cash or cut spending, including fining restaurants for serving shredded cucumber on noodles without a license or cutting fuel subsidies in the middle of winter. An \u2018extreme\u2019 response After the tax crackdown went viral on social media, the State Administration of Taxation issued a statement Tuesday, trying to calm nerves. It acknowledged that some tax authorities had been inspecting companies for potential misconduct but denied that it had launched \u201cany nationwide, industry-specific or centralized tax inspections.\u201d  \u201cWe fully understand the concerns of the business community and the public, \u201c it added. The admission has whipped up speculation online this week that the establishment of \u201cPolice & Taxation Joint Combat Centers\u201d in some parts of the country will result in much more aggressive taxation policies to come. The centers, which enable local police and taxation authorities to share intelligence and manpower, were first trialed in the city of Yichun in the southeastern province of Jiangxi in 2021. And the central government\u2019s attempt to reassure has jarred with the local crackdowns, causing confusion and fear. Investigating possible back taxes from 20 or 30 years ago seems \u201cextreme,\u201d said Frank Tian Xie, a professor at the University of South Carolina Aiken. \u201cIf those companies indeed owed taxes before, why didn\u2019t the authority go after them right away? \u2026 Why isn\u2019t it the government\u2019s negligence in tax collection that resulted in this fiasco?\u201d he said. The resulting payments, including the unpaid tax, fines and interest could be \u201cexorbitant\u201d and lead to bankruptcies of many companies, he warned. The crackdown poses \u201csevere risks to businesses already strained by operational challenges and external economic pressures,\u201d Singleton said. \u201cThis could ripple through the economy, potentially exacerbating job losses and dampening investor confidence.\u201d Beijing has been trying to reassure the private sector over the past year. Such businesses have become increasingly reluctant to borrow or invest, after years of regulatory crackdowns and stringent Covid restrictions battered their confidence. Profits hit So far, the targets of the probes have been privately owned businesses in a variety of industries. V V has warned that its bottomline could take a hit. Last year, the soy milk seller made a net profit of only 209 million yuan ($29 million). And it\u2019s still unsure how much it owes in fines, which could be potentially higher than the actual $11.7 million tax bill. Last Wednesday, Ningbo Bohui Chemical Technology, a producer of additives and light fuel oil, said\u00a0it had to suspend production because of \u201coperating cash difficulties.\u201d The cash crunch was revealed shortly after the Ningbo government asked the company to pay taxes for one of its products sold between July 2023 and March 2024. The company said that would \u201caffect\u201d its net profits by about 500 million yuan ($69 million). The tax bureau later said the levy was imposed after a national rule was updated last year. The company said it shouldn\u2019t have been subjected to the tax. \u201cIt [the new taxes] will have a significant adverse impact on the company\u2019s 2023 performance and future production and operations,\u201d Bohui said in a statement in March. \u201cThe company will swing from profits to big losses in 2023.\u201d Zangge Mining, a producer of potassium chloride in the western province of Qinghai, said in April that it had received a demand from the Golmud city government to pay back taxes from 2019 to 2023. Including fines, the company needed to pay a total amount of 480 million yuan ($66 million). Chongqing-based PKU Healthcare, Shanghai-based Shunho New Materials, Shenzhen-based ChinaLin Securities, and Yunan-based Yixintang Pharmaceutical Group have also paid tax bills to local governments going as far back as seven years, according to separate statements made in March and April. The amounts paid vary from 8 million yuan ($1.1 million) to 310 million yuan ($43 million). The first company to report on the trend this year was LianTronics, a major LED display manufacturer. It said in January that the Shenzhen government had asked for payment of 19.8 million yuan ($2.7 million) in back taxes for 2017 and 20.2 million yuan ($2.8 million) in fines.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/business/china-local-government-tax-crackdown-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/23/2024", "section": "business"}}

Despite a promise in the contract reached with the Teamsters union last year, UPS has not yet purchased any new vans with AC, even as temperatures soar across the country and the dangers of extreme heat put workers in harms way in and out of doors. Almost none of the nearly 100,000 brown package vans have AC. Temperatures inside the trucks, both the cab and especially the cargo space where drivers need to go to fetch and drop off packages, can regularly get well over 120 degrees, according to the Teamsters union, which represents more than 300,000 UPS employees. The union\u2019s demand for relief from the heat for its nearly 100,000 members working as delivery drivers was a major sticking point in contract negotiations last year between the union and the package delivery giant.\u00a0It was far more than an issue of comfort; it was a worker safety issue, according to the union. Drivers have been known to suffer heatstroke, with some coming close to death, while on the job in the vans. And as part of the contract reached in late July of last year, UPS agreed that all vans purchased after January 1 would include air conditioning. UPS also agreed to retrofit existing vans with fans in the cab, heat shields under the cargo area and what are known as \u201cscoop air intakes\u201d in the cargo area. The fans have been installed in all the vans, UPS said. About two thirds have been retrofitted with the heat shields and air scoops, reducing the temperature in the rear cargo by about 17 degrees on average, according to the company. But there have been no vans purchased this year, so no additional AC vans are on the roads. The company said van purchase decisions are based on package volume and the need to replace existing fleet, and there has been no need to make purchases so far. The Teamsters are not pleased by the lack of progress on the AC. \u201cWe are midway\u00a0into the summer, and frankly UPS is not moving fast enough,\u201d said the union in a statement to CNN. \u201cWe are aware that UPS has installed all contractually required second fans, and UPS is ahead of schedule in the installation of heat shields and air induction scoops for package compartment ventilation. But it\u2019s not enough.\u201d There are a small number of vans \u2013 in the hundreds \u2013 that have AC. Those are electric vans, or specialized vans for rural area that can go on gravel roads, UPS said. But they make up only a small fraction of the 94,000 UPS package vans on American roads. The number of vans with AC was bound to grow slowly. Some vans can last for more than 15 years. Retrofitting the existing fleet was going to bring more immediate relief. UPS told CNN it is very concerned with workers\u2019 safety and that AC was never going to be key to its heat mitigation efforts. In addition to the heat shield and air scoops, it has installed an additional 1,500 ice machines and 1,700 water fountains in its facilities. It said it also provided specialized cooling gear for UPS drivers and inside staff\u00a0to wear, as well as water jugs for drivers. And for inside workers it has installed additional fans in its buildings\u00a0and will install more. But AC is still a rarity in the UPS vans on the road.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/22/business/ups-delivery-vans-air-conditioning/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/23/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_21_media_washington-post-staffers-jeff-bezos-publisher-crisis", "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:\u00a0A version of this article first appeared in the \u201cReliable Sources\u201d newsletter.\u00a0Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here. When will\u00a0Jeff Bezos\u00a0actually\u00a0address the upheaval roiling his newsroom? The Washington Post\u00a0owner and\u00a0Amazon\u00a0billionaire has yet to take any real action to quell concerns at his newspaper, which remains engulfed in disarray as explosive reports are published day after day throwing the ethical integrity of the outlet\u2019s new publisher,\u00a0Will Lewis, into serious question. Staffers at The Post are losing their patience with Bezos, whose only action thus far responding to the Lewis calamity has been to fire off a paltry, 138-word, single-paragraph memo from his\u00a0Mediterranean\u00a0yachting vacation to a handful of leaders at The Post, assuring them that he wants standards to remain \u201cvery high.\u201d In the eyes of staffers at The Post, that is the very issue. They too want standards to remain \u201cvery high\u201d and fear that Lewis poses an active danger to that shared goal. More drama unfolded Friday after the Lewis announced Robert Winnett, who Lewis named as the paper\u2019s incoming editor, would not to come to lead the Post. That follows a 3,000-word front page expose this week, in which\u00a0The Post\u00a0reported\u00a0that Winnett had previously used materials from a self-described \u201cthief\u201d for reporting. Frustrations and concerns are so high at the outlet that two of the institution\u2019s\u00a0Pulitzer Prize-winning journalists have\u00a0chosen to speak out\u00a0on the record, calling for a change in leadership, an unheard of step at the storied newspaper.\u00a0David Maraniss, an associate editor who has worked at The Post for nearly five decades, said he doesn\u2019t \u201cknow a single person at the Post who thinks the current situation with the publisher and supposed new editor can stand.\u201d And\u00a0Scott Higham, who has worked at The Post for more than two decades, agreed and called for Lewis\u2019 head. \u201cWill Lewis needs to step down for the good of The Post and the public,\u201d wrote Higham on Facebook. \u201cHe has lost the newsroom and will never win it back.\u201d Suffice to say, Maraniss and Higham are just saying aloud what much of the newsroom is thinking. In conversations with more than a dozen people inside and close to The Post this week, it\u2019s been made clear that Lewis, in his brief six months on the job, has\u00a0totally\u00a0alienated staff and now faces insurmountable odds to win back the employee base he seeks to lead. Whether he has good business ideas or not, is not the question. He\u2019s lost the respect of his staff. And any good leader will tell you, without a legitimacy to lead, it is unfeasible to get anything done, let alone stage a Herculean business transformation. A spokesperson for Bezos did not respond to requests for comment on Thursday. But surely the billionaire understands the dire situation gripping The Post. And it taxes the imagination to believe that he really believes his brief memo to The Post\u2019s leadership was enough to extinguish the concerns that have spurred the unprecedented uproar at the newspaper. In fact, it\u2019s notable that Bezos has not explicitly voiced support for Lewis in recent days, giving him options as he evaluates the deteriorating situation and determines how to stem the bleeding. Staffers at The Post are very much waiting for Bezos to take some\u00a0meaningful\u00a0form of action. Since anger at Lewis erupted earlier this month, CNN has been repeatedly told by those who work at the outlet that the ongoing drama has distracted the newsroom from its invaluable work. Suffice to say, with a high-stakes election only months away, it is anything but ideal to have the attention of one of the nation\u2019s preeminent news organizations diverted by internal turmoil whirling within its walls. It\u2019s \u201ca massive distraction,\u201d one Postie underscored to me Thursday, adding that\u00a0The Guardian\u2019s\u00a0eyebrow-raising story\u00a0accusing Lewis of having once advised then-U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u00a0to \u201cclean up\u201d his phone during the so-called \u201cPartygate\u201d scandals is \u201cthe talk of the newsroom.\u201d (Lewis and Johnson denied the story.) \u201cI don\u2019t think the mood will change until something else changes,\u201d the staffer added. In the absence of Bezos, the stories raising questions about Lewis\u2019 ethical integrity keep coming. The\u00a0Financial Times\u00a0reported Thursday\u00a0that Lewis still \u201cretains links\u201d to a public relations firm that advises high-powered corporate and political leaders how to navigate thorny situations. While the FT reported Lewis had sold his ownership stake in the business, the outlet noted the firm has \u201ccontinued to distribute regular emails from Lewis,\u201d causing \u201cconfusion among people in contact with the agency.\u201d While the FT\u2019s Thursday story certainly did not carry with it the same weight as the reports that have been published in recent days from other news outlets, it added yet additional questions about Lewis\u2019 history and entanglements. Meanwhile, it is likely that many more questions will be raised in the future as The Post and outlets such as\u00a0The New York Times\u00a0continue to take a hard look at Lewis\u2019 history. And as those questions keep coming, those at The Post will certainly have one in particular for Bezos: What are you planning to do to restore the respect and status of your storied newspaper?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/media/washington-post-staffers-jeff-bezos-publisher-crisis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/23/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_business_uk-millionaires-loss-record", "text": "A record number of millionaires could leave the United Kingdom this year as political turmoil and the potential for higher taxes under a future Labour government reduce the appeal of what was once among the top destinations for the rich. As many as 9,500 people with at least $1 million in liquid, investable assets, will leave the country, more than double the number that left in 2023, according to provisional estimates contained in a report Tuesday by migration advisers Henley & Partners. \u201cThese figures reflect a steady accumulation of factors detracting from the UK\u2019s appeal to high-net-worth individuals,\u201d Hannah White, CEO of the Institute for Government, wrote in the report. \u201cThe hangover from Brexit continues to be felt, with the City of London no longer seen as the financial center of the world.\u201d The report is based on data on 150,000 high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) tracked by investment firm New World Wealth. The firm only counts people who stay in their new country more than half of the year, and focuses primarily on company founders, chairs, CEOs, presidents, directors and managing partners. The continuing exodus from the UK \u2014 16,500 millionaires left between 2017 and 2023 \u2014 is part of a global mass migration of the rich that appears to be accelerating. The Henley Private Wealth Migration report found that 128,000 millionaires are set to relocate this year, beating last year\u2019s record by 8,000. \u201cAs the world grapples with a perfect storm of geopolitical tensions, economic uncertainty and social upheaval, millionaires are voting with their feet in record numbers,\u201d Dominic Volek, head of private clients at Henley & Partners, said in a press release. Of the 15 places with most resident millionaires, the UK is suffering more than most \u2014 only China will lose more HNWIs (15,200) in 2024 \u2014 and it\u2019s one of just three locations, alongside Japan and Hong Kong, to have seen a net loss in the decade since 2013, according to the report. By contrast, the ranks of the wealthy have grown in the US, Canada, Australia, Germany and France over the same period. The impact of Brexit, which ended the free movement of people between the UK and the European Union as well as raising new barriers to trade and investment, and other economic shocks such as the war in Ukraine and the ensuing energy price spike, has been compounded by a period of unprecedented political uncertainty. The UK has had five prime ministers since 2010, including the 45-day tenure of Liz Truss in 2022, when her plan to jack up government borrowing to slash taxes sent the pound crashing to a record low against the dollar and forced the Bank of England to intervene to prevent a financial crisis. Such instability has made it much harder for policymakers to address the country\u2019s anemic economic growth and foster a better climate for investment. Now there\u2019s a new risk on the horizon. Keir Starmer\u2019s Labour Party, which is leading Prime Minister Rishi Sunak\u2019s Conservatives by a margin of about 20% in opinion polls, has gone out of its way to woo business and investors, and to promise economic stability and stronger growth if it wins the upcoming election on July 4. Starmer and his finance spokesperson Rachel Reeves, who previously worked at the Bank of England, have promised not to increase income tax or sales tax \u2014 and to stick with fiscal rules adopted by Sunak\u2019s government. But Labour is committed to targeted tax increases that could hit the rich. It wants to remove a 20% tax break from private schools to fund new teachers in the state sector, close remaining loopholes that allow so-called non-dom residents to protect some of their foreign earnings from tax and raise more money from private equity firms. \u201cThe outflow of high-net-worth individuals already generated by the economic and political context is now being accelerated by policy decisions ahead of the election,\u201d said White. Still, one very rich couple will apparently be staying, whatever the result on July 4. Sunak, a millionaire former hedge fund manager, and his wife Akshata Murty \u2014 the daughter of an Indian tech billionaire \u2014 are worth \u00a3651 million ($826 million), according to The Sunday Times Rich List, making them richer than King Charles. Sunak said last week he would serve a full term if re-elected as member of parliament in his northern England constituency, even if his party is kicked out of government.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/business/uk-millionaires-loss-record/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/23/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_20_tech_new-york-hochul-social-media-algorithms-children", "text": "Big changes are coming for New York\u2019s youngest social media users after Gov. Kathy Hochul signed two bills into law Thursday clamping down on digital platforms\u2019 algorithms and use of children\u2019s data. The unprecedented move makes New York the first state to pass a law regulating social media algorithms amid nationwide allegations that apps such as Instagram or TikTok have hooked users with addictive features. Hochul\u2019s signature comes days after US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy called for warning labels to be applied to social media platforms, fueling a debate about social media\u2019s potential impact on the mental health of users, particularly teens. Under New York\u2019s SAFE For Kids Act, social media platforms will be required to display content chronologically by default for kids under 18, while the New York Child Data Protection Act will restrict websites from collecting or sharing the personal data of users under 18 without consent \u2014 expanding on existing federal privacy protections for children under 13. The SAFE For Kids Act also requires platforms to limit late-night app notifications that state lawmakers say are engineered to drive user engagement and that risk hindering sleep. Both pieces of legislation were introduced last fall and cleared the state legislature in early June. New York officials hailed the legislation as a critical check on social media platforms\u2019 influence over teens. \u201cToday, we save our children,\u201d Hochul said Thursday at a press conference. \u201cWe have heard their cries for help, reminding us as adults that we have a moral responsibility to protect young New Yorkers from harm and from addictive forces.\u201d In a statement Thursday afternoon, a Meta spokesperson said, \u201cWhile we don\u2019t agree with every aspect of these bills, we welcome New York becoming the first state to pass legislation recognizing the responsibility of app stores.\u201d \u201cAccording to research, the vast majority of parents support legislation requiring app stores to obtain parental approval to download apps, and we will continue to work with policymakers in New York and elsewhere to advance this approach,\u201d the spokesperson said. CNN has reached out to Google, Snap and TikTok for comment. Some academics have said that while studies highlight associations between specific types of social media activities and negative mental health outcomes \u2013 such as engaging in social comparison \u2013 a causal link between those harms and general social media use is less clear. Still, numerous states and federal lawmakers have pushed for legislation clamping down on social media platforms, arguing that tech companies\u2019 products are to blame for eating disorders, sleeplessness, distraction and, in some cases, self-harm and suicide. \u201cWe will save lives with this, my friends,\u201d Hochul said at Thursday\u2019s press conference. New York Attorney General Letitia James added Thursday that the legislation would take on \u201cthe most dangerous aspects of social media, the addictive algorithm feeds that exploit impressionable minds.\u201d \u201cThese bills will empower my office to set rules and ensure companies are following them,\u201d James said. Opponents of the social media algorithm bill \u2014 including but not limited to the tech industry \u2014 have said the legislation is likely unconstitutional because it infringes on children\u2019s First Amendment rights and raises other questions about how social media can function in practice across state lines. \u201cIt\u2019s a well-intentioned effort, but it\u2019s aimed at the wrong target,\u201d said Adam Kovacevich, CEO of the tech industry advocacy group Chamber of Progress. \u201cAlgorithmic curation makes teenagers\u2019 feeds healthier, and banning algorithms is going to make social media worse for teens.\u201d The legislation\u2019s signing sets the stage for another in a long string of court battles over state social media laws. States such as Arkansas, Florida, Louisiana and many others have passed laws clamping down on social media companies\u2019 approach to teens. Industry groups have challenged some of that legislation, and courts have largely viewed the laws with skepticism. In Ohio this year, for example, a federal judge temporarily blocked a law prohibiting online platforms from creating accounts for users under 16 unless they obtain parental consent, saying the legislation likely violates the First Amendment. Two states, Texas and Florida, have passed laws that would restrict online platforms from moderating their sites; legal challenges reached the Supreme Court this term and a decision is expected within weeks.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/tech/new-york-hochul-social-media-algorithms-children/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/23/2024", "section": "business"}}
