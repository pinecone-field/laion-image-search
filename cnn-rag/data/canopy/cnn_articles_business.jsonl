Gallup, in its \u201cState of the Global Workplace,\u201d estimates that low employee engagement costs the global economy $8.9 trillion, or 9% of global GDP. The report includes findings from its latest annual World Poll, which surveyed 128,278 employees in more than 140 countries last year. That poll found that roughly 20% of workers globally reported feeling lonely, angry or sad on a daily basis. And 41% on average say they feel stress. Those most likely to say they feel lonely were younger workers (22%), employees who worked remotely full-time (25%) and those who felt most disengaged on the job (31%). While work isn\u2019t always the cause of a person\u2019s negative daily emotions, employers should still be concerned. That\u2019s because work can either improve or worsen employees\u2019 well-being. On the one hand,\u00a0the Gallup report noted,\u00a0\u201cwhen employees find their work and work relationships meaningful, employment is associated with high levels of daily enjoyment and low levels of all negative daily emotions. Notably, half of employees who are engaged at work are thriving in life overall.\u201d On the other, researchers found that being disengaged at work can negatively affect a person\u2019s wellbeing as much as \u2014 or more than \u2014 not having a job at all. \u201cEmployees who dislike their jobs tend to have high levels of daily stress and worry, as well as elevated levels of all other negative emotions,\u201d they wrote. \u201cOn many wellbeing items (stress, anger, worry, loneliness), being actively disengaged at work is equivalent to or worse than being unemployed.\u201d Engaged managers help workers thrive The poll found that last year only 23% of employees were engaged at work, unchanged from the year prior. Gallup defines an engaged employee as someone \u201chighly involved in and enthusiastic about their work and workplace. They are psychological \u2018owners,\u2019 drive performance and innovation, and move the organization forward.\u201d But those who said they were not engaged rose by 3 percentage points to 62%. These are employees characterized as \u201cpsychologically unattached to their work and company. Because their engagement needs are not being fully met, they are putting time but not energy or passion into their work.\u201d Engagement levels are highest in so-called \u201cbest practice\u201d organizations, where three-fourths of managers on average are engaged as well as seven in 10 non-managers, Gallup said. Their best practices include leaders\u2019 emphasizing well-being at work and in life; and putting a high priority on manager hiring and development. The manager piece of the equation is especially crucial. \u201c[W]hen managers are engaged, employees are more likely to be engaged,\u201d the report said. And, it added, \u201chigh-engagement business units are likely to see significantly higher employee wellbeing \u2014 as well as higher productivity, profitability and sales \u2014 than low-engagement teams.\u201d Where the most and least stressed workers are Engagement and well-being results varied in each of the 10 regions covered by Gallup\u2019s poll. The report noted that the United States and Canada, for example, showed the highest percentage of engaged employees (33%) among all the regions studied; and the third highest percentage of thriving employees (53%), behind Australia and New Zealand (60%) and Latin America and the Caribbean (54%). But the US and Canada also ranked second among employees experiencing daily stress (49%), right behind the Middle East and North Africa (52%). By contrast, Europe showed the lowest level of employee engagement (13%). South Asia scored lowest in terms of employees described as thriving overall (13%). And countries in post-Soviet Eurasia ranked lowest in terms of daily stress (19%).", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/success/gallup-workers-economy-lonely-unhappy/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/13/2024", "section": "business"}}

Shares of the tech behemoth rose 2.1% to an all-time high close of $377.44 on Monday, beating the previous record of $376.17. That comes after shares of Microsoft fell 1.7% on Friday, when Sam Altman was ousted from his position at OpenAI in a boardroom coup. Microsoft is the artificial intelligence firm\u2019s biggest stakeholder, with a $13 billion investment in the company. Greg Brockman, who co-founded OpenAI and quit after Altman\u2019s firing, is also joining Microsoft. Altman\u2019s hiring ended days of speculation that the former chief executive could return to the firm after his dramatic firing. Emmett Shear, former CEO of Amazon-owned streaming service Twitch, will replace OpenAI chief technology officer Mira Murati as interim chief executive. Microsoft shares are up about 56% for the year. The stock is one of the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d that have powered the lion\u2019s share of the market\u2019s returns this year, boosted by Wall Street\u2019s bet that artificial intelligence is the next big thing in tech.

{"id": "2024_07_11_media_biden-hollywood-support-withdraw", "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:\u00a0A version of this article first appeared in the \u201cReliable Sources\u201d newsletter.\u00a0Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here. Joe Biden\u00a0is losing a particularly influential corner of support: Hollywood. On Wednesday,\u00a0George Clooney\u00a0became the latest \u2014 and perhaps most notable \u2014 member of the Tinseltown elite publicly to express misgivings about Biden\u2019s candidacy, calling on the embattled president to drop out of the 2024 race. \u201cI love Joe Biden. As a senator. As a vice president and as president. I consider him a friend, and I believe in him,\u201d Clooney wrote\u00a0in a blunt piece\u00a0for\u00a0The New York Times. \u201cBelieve in his character. Believe in his morals. In the last four years, he\u2019s won many of the battles he\u2019s faced.\u201d \u201cBut the one battle he cannot win is the fight against time. None of us can,\u201d Clooney added. \u201cIt\u2019s devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe \u2018big F-ing deal\u2019 Biden of 2010. He wasn\u2019t even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\u201d Clooney, a major Democratic donor and one of Biden\u2019s most high-profile supporters, concluded his piece by writing, \u201cJoe Biden is a hero; he saved democracy in 2020. We need him to do it again in 2024.\u201d The unreserved take from Clooney added even more pressure on Biden to exit the race. More importantly, Clooney\u2019s candid assessment is representative of the mounting pressure Biden is facing out west, where his all-important and deep-pocketed support in Hollywood is quickly eroding. The potential loss of Hollywood spells major problems for the president, who has not only counted on the City of Angels for the strong surrogates it has offered him, but also for the film industry\u2019s ability to raise millions of dollars to power his campaign. In fact, the Hollywood fundraiser that Clooney headlined last month and referenced in his piece,\u00a0raised a staggering $30 million\u00a0\u2014 more than any other Democratic fundraiser in history. Now that crucial support is in flux. Since Biden\u2019s hard-to-watch performance at the CNN debate, a number of influential Hollywood voices have gone public with their concerns about his candidacy, with many calling on the president to exit the race. Director\u00a0Rob Reiner\u00a0shared Clooney\u2019s op-ed Wednesday on\u00a0X, writing that \u201cdemocracy is facing an existential threat\u201d and that Biden \u201cmust step aside\u201d to make way for \u201csomeone younger to fight back\u201d against Donald Trump.\u00a0Netflix\u00a0co-founder\u00a0Reed Hastings\u00a0told The Times\u00a0last week that Biden needs to \u201cstep aside.\u201d The\u00a0\u201cLOST\u201d\u00a0creator\u00a0Damon Lindelof\u00a0wrote a piece\u00a0for\u00a0Deadline, saying Biden \u201chas to go\u201d and urging fellow Hollywood denizens to stop writing checks until a new candidate is named. Disney heiress\u00a0Abigail Disney\u00a0also said\u00a0she would withhold donations until Biden is replaced. And\u00a0Endeavor\u00a0boss\u00a0Ari Emanuel\u00a0said at a conference that he was \u201cpissed off at the founding fathers\u201d for having never put an age limit on the presidency. \u201cDonald Trump said, \u2018I\u2019m the only one.\u2019 Right? \u2018I alone can make all these problems go away.\u2019 And now Biden is saying, \u2018I\u2019m the only one that can beat Trump.\u2019 Seems like it\u2019s pretty similar here, {but} we have a great bench in the Democratic Party,\u201d Emanuel said last week. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at a man who\u2019s saying the other guy\u2019s a liar, and he\u2019s telling us malarkey!\u201d Turing the tide in Hollywood will be a difficult challenge for Biden, who is simultaneously struggling to keep Democratic members of Congress and governors from expressing concerns about his ability to defeat Trump and serve another term in office. I\u2019m told that the Biden campaign has actively been making phone calls to Hollywood supporters, working to maintain their support in this turbulent moment. As for Clooney, a senior Biden campaign adviser told me, \u201cPOTUS won\u2019t be sitting front row at \u2018Oceans 14.\u2019\u201d But, the person added, Biden is \u201cencouraged by the strong grassroots support we\u2019re seeing and he\u2019s determined to earn every vote and win this election.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/media/biden-hollywood-support-withdraw/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/13/2024", "section": "business"}}

However, it\u2019s clear that there is something different about Dex; she\u2019s an entirely virtual \u201cdigital human,\u201d designed by a startup in the UK. For her performances, Dex is displayed on a video screen or as a holographic projection, with her mixes created by humans. She is animated using Unreal Engine \u2014 a 3D modeling software widely used in video games \u2014 combined with motion-capture. Generative artificial intelligence allows her to remember information and respond to questions, using a voice also generated by AI. \u201cShe\u2019s probably one of the only digital humans in the performance space that you can have a conversation and interact with,\u201d says Denise Harris, CCO of startup Sum Vivas. \u201cYou can ask her anything. She is a genius about music.\u201d Last month, Dex performed at Digital Fashion Weeks in New York, Paris and Milan, and she has modeled outfits by Prada and Louis Vuitton at digital fashion events. For Liverpool-based Sum Vivas she\u2019s a \u201cshowpiece\u201d for more practical applications. The company is now developing digital humans that can \u201clisten\u201d to people\u2019s questions and converse in real time. \u201cShellie\u201d can provide product information as an avatar on company websites, while \u201cArif\u201d is set to direct passengers and answer questions as a multilingual concierge on screens at airports. According to CEO and founder Rob Sims, digital humans can help bridge the gap between AI technology and people. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve found is when people start working with and conversing with a digital human, they very quickly suspend disbelief,\u201d Sims tells CNN. \u201cIt becomes natural.\u201d AI explosion Since OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT was launched in November 2022, considerable hype has surrounded the potential of generative AI \u2014 artificial intelligence powered by huge datasets of information, capable of generating text outputs in a conversational way. Record levels of investment into generative AI have followed, with over $21 billion poured into the industry during the first nine months of last year, according to data insights company Pitchbook. In March 2023, Google launched Bard (recently renamed Gemini) and around the same time Anthropic released its AI assistant Claude. As generative AI chatbots become increasingly ubiquitous, Sum Vivas is one of several companies looking to make them more human. US and New Zealand-based UneeQ has developed animated conversational \u201cdigital humans\u201d that can be used as virtual sales reps and customer service agents on company websites, and this month it debuted Sama 2.0, an animated cabin crew member that answers questions on Qatar Airways\u2019 website and app. Microsoft recently announced that users of its Azure software would be able to create lifelike avatars capable of turning text prompts into animated speech. However, there are widespread concerns about the impact AI could have on the job market.  \u201cWhen we rely on automated tools, what skills are we losing in the process?\u201d asks Jennifer Ding, senior researcher at the Alan Turing Institute, the UK\u2019s national institute for data science and artificial intelligence. \u201cIn some ways, we think of AI as something that\u2019s helping us or augmenting our work,\u201d she says. \u201cHowever, alongside, this fear of replacement is bubbling up more and more.\u201d Harris, however, points to new opportunities within digital human design and development. \u201cEvery scenario that we found, we\u2019re creating jobs and working in harmony with people rather than taking away jobs,\u201d she says. \u201cDigital humans, first and foremost, should work with other human colleagues,\u201d adds Sims. \u201cWe\u2019ll move into a stage where digital humans will start to become just another member of the team, with added benefits for that team, and obviously the customers they serve.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/business/digital-humans-ai-dj-dex-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/13/2024", "section": "business"}}

Shoppers are also being squeezed by\u00a0higher prices at the grocery store, with food prices experiencing modest upticks last month, according to the newest inflation report. \u201cStop & Shop has evaluated its overall store portfolio and made the difficult decision to close underperforming stores to create a healthy base for the future growth of our brand,\u201d said the chain\u2019s president Gordon Reid in a release. Ahold Delhaize, the chain\u2019s Dutch parent company, revealed the locations Friday adding that they will close in early November. The closures come amid a broader shake up in the US grocery industry including the rise of low-cost grocery brand Aldi, which plans to open open 800 locations. In addition, Kroger and Albertson\u2019s announced plans for a $25 billion merger earlier this year. The Federal Trade Commission has sued to block it. Ahold Delhaize announced in May at its investor day that store reductions were planned, but didn\u2019t specify locations. The affected stores span all five states it has locations in, including 10 in New Jersey, eight in Massachusetts, seven in New York, five in Connecticut plus two locations in Rhode Island. Stop & Shop said it \u201cremains committed to serving its communities through other store locations, online shopping and home delivery services.\u201d Employees impacted by the closures will be offered other opportunities in the company. Following the closures, the 110-year-old chain said it will \u201ccontinue to have a strong presence across its five-state footprint with more than 350 stores.\u201d Stop & Shop has remodeled about half of its locations since 2018, with those refreshed stores \u201coutperforming\u201d the ones that haven\u2019t been updated.

{"id": "2024_07_08_business_mcdonalds-menu-salads", "text": "McDonald\u2019s once poured big marketing dollars into its salads. But since 2020, greens have been off the menu. That\u2019s because the chain has concluded that when people go to McDonald\u2019s, they mostly want a burger and fries. \u201cIf people really want salads from McDonald\u2019s we will gladly relaunch salads,\u201d said Joe Erlinger, the president of McDonald\u2019s USA, in a June interview at the Wall Street Journal\u2019s annual Global Food Forum. \u201cBut what our experience has proven is that\u2019s not what the consumer\u2019s looking for from McDonald\u2019s,\u201d he added. \u201cThey\u2019re looking for great french fries, they\u2019re looking for a $5 meal deal, they\u2019re looking for a hot fresh sandwich. And so, that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to continue to provide them.\u201d Serving a healthy meal \u2014 or one fit for vegetarians, vegans or children \u2014 can help fast food chains avoid a so-called \u201cveto vote,\u201d which involves a group or family skipping a restaurant that doesn\u2019t have options for picky eaters or ones with dietary restrictions. For McDonald\u2019s, putting salads on the menu was likely a way to avoid the veto vote and stay atop recent healthy food trends. McDonald\u2019s had been serving salads for decades prior to the pandemic. Salads made it possible for some to eat at the chain while watching their diets (as one diet blogger noted, \u201cthe salads were the only half-healthy item\u00a0I could eat at McDonald\u2019s.\u201d) For others, it may have been more of a way to feel like they were eating healthy, even if they weren\u2019t. But in 2018, salads became more of a liability than a draw. That year, hundreds of people were sickened with an intestinal illness caused by consuming contaminated food or water. McDonald\u2019s salads were \u201cone likely source of these infections,\u201d the CDC said at the time. During the outbreak, the chain stopped selling its salads at 3,000 restaurants as a precautionary measure. And then, two years later, Covid hit, and restaurants facing labor shortages and tangled supply chains slimmed down their menus to focus on their most popular items. McDonald\u2019s removed salads from national menus in 2020 to help simplify restaurant operations, the company said. In 2022, the chain gave its franchise operators the option of serving pre-made salads but many decided not to, the Wall Street Journal reported. The strategy paid off. Sales ballooned as the chain came up with ways to update and market their core items. And now, the chain is focusing its efforts on convincing customers  to choose their $5 meal deal, rather than a competitor\u2019s, while the salad has been left behind. Another menu item that\u2019s not coming to McDonald\u2019s any time soon? A plant-based burger, which McDonald\u2019s tested a few years ago. \u201cI don\u2019t think the US consumer is \u2026 looking for McPlant or other plant-based proteins from McDonald\u2019s now,\u201d Erlinger said at the June conference, but added that \u201cit\u2019s a trend that we\u2019ll continue to monitor.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/business/mcdonalds-menu-salads/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/13/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_12_business_inflation-cpi-biden-nightcap", "text": "We did it, y\u2019all! Get the Champagne on ice and gather the townsfolk because America hath slain the beast known as inflation. (Or, at least, it\u2019s hit a turning point.) ICYMI: Last month, for the first time in four years, prices on everyday goods and services actually\u00a0fell. In other words, this June was the first time since the pandemic started that we paid less for stuff compared with the previous month. The surprise price decline is seismic news, at least among econ wonks and a narrow strata of reporters who follow this stuff with the fervor of a tween Swiftie. \u201cInflation is dead, and jobs are alive,\u201d labor economist Aaron Sojourner tells me. \u201cWe have a very good chance right now of sticking the soft landing.\u201d Huzzah! Maximum employment and price stability? Let\u2019s party. But wait \u2014 what\u2019s that I hear? Not the riotous cheers of American consumers dancing in the streets. Not a chorus of workers singing about the strongest labor market of their lifetimes, and no \u2014 I can\u2019t even pick up on the sound of what I\u2019m sure is an army of economists demanding sainthood for Jay Powell. Instead, the single best economic news of the past decade is but a murmur of chit-chat, barely audible against a clamor of politicos shouting about President Joe Biden\u2019s age. And that has got to drive the Biden campaign absolutely nuts. Bidenomics worked and no one cares For the past three years, President Biden\u2019s biggest political liabilities have been painfully obvious: his age and inflation. One those problems has more or less evaporated \u2014 inflation has been steadily cooling, from 9% to 3% on annualized basis, for the past two years. Consumers are finally expressing some optimism, if not for the economy as a whole then at least for their own personal financial situations, the stock market and cooling inflation. Of course, everyone knows intellectually that the president doesn\u2019t control the economy. But that\u2019s never stopped voters from blaming whoever\u2019s in office for, well, just about anything, and similarly no party would miss an opportunity to claim credit for an economic boom. To be sure, American households aren\u2019t suddenly going to forget the whiplash of inflation that has strained their finances. It remains true, as my colleague Alicia Wallace notes, that overall prices are a good 20% higher than they were in February 2020. (In recent history, the index would typically rise about 10% over a 54-month period, Labor Department data shows.) And nothing in economics goes in a straight line. Just 24 hours after the jaw-dropping consumer price report, Friday brought some unexpected bad news around producer prices, which rose 0.2% in June after holding flat in May. Still, Thursday should have been a day for the White House to spike the football and double down on a message that has, historically, fallen flat \u2014 that Bidenomics is working. Unfortunately, if you\u2019re in the Biden camp, age \u2014 unlike inflation \u2014 only goes one direction. Rather than doing a victory lap, Biden on Thursday was preparing for a high-stakes news conference in front of a ravenous White House press corps that focused their questions almost entirely on his fitness to lead. During the press conference, he touted the inflation numbers repeatedly, comparing the positive economic situation now to the pandemic mess he inherited when he started the job. But the press\u2019 questions focused mostly on his verbal slipups and chances of beating former President Donald Trump. Bottom line: Thursday\u2019s inflation report is an indisputably positive development that could put some wind in the sails of a Democratic campaign \u2014 a powerful blow against the fictional Republican narrative about a US economy in the gutter. The White House can finally cross out \u201cinflation\u201d on its list of presidential liabilities. But as long as Biden\u2019s age dominates the conversation, it\u2019ll just be the econ nerds sipping Champagne alone.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/12/business/inflation-cpi-biden-nightcap/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/13/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_01_tech_meta-eu-competition-rules", "text": "Facebook parent Meta has been accused of breaking Europe\u2019s new digital competition rules over its \u201cpay or consent\u201d advertising model. Late last year, Meta (META)\u00a0launched\u00a0a service called \u201cSubscription for no ads,\u201d allowing European users of Facebook and Instagram to pay up to \u20ac12.99 ($14) a month for ad-free versions. The alternative is to accept versions with personalized ads. The European Commission said in a statement Monday that, in its preliminary view, \u201cthis binary choice forces users to consent to the (use) of their personal data and fails to provide them a less personalized but equivalent version of Meta\u2019s social networks.\u201d If the provisional findings of the Commission\u2019s investigation are confirmed, the EU could hit Meta with a fine equivalent to 10% of its global annual revenue under its landmark Digital Markets Act. Based on the company\u2019s 2023 results, that would amount to $13.5 billion. Meta said it didn\u2019t accept the Commission\u2019s findings. \u201c\u2019Subscription for no ads\u2019 follows the direction of the highest court in Europe and complies with the DMA,\u201d a spokesperson told CNN. \u201cWe look forward to further constructive dialogue with the European Commission to bring this investigation to a close.\u201d The EU announcement comes a week after the Commission accused Apple (AAPL) of breaching the DMA by preventing app developers from freely directing consumers to cheaper services. The regulators are also investigating Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) under the new law. The DMA, which came into force in March, requires dominant online platforms \u2014 so-called gatekeepers \u2014 to give users more choice, and rivals more opportunities to compete. Online platforms often collect personal data across their own and third-party services and use it in digital advertising services. Margrethe Vestager, a European Commissioner in charge of competition policy, noted in Monday\u2019s statement that Meta had been accumulating personal data of \u201cmillions of EU citizens over many years.\u201d \u201cWe want to empower citizens to be able to take control over their own data and choose a less personalized ads experience,\u201d she said.

Although Biden has made several public appearances since the debate, he has read prepared remarks at those events. This will be his first off-the-cuff appearance since the debate.

ABC did not immediately respond a request for comment about whether it plans to publish the full unedited version of the interview. Due to timing constraints, networks usually edit down interviews for shows. Biden\u2019s last major interview was with David Muir in Normandy last month. He previously spoke to CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett on May 8 and with Time magazine\u2019s Massimo Calabresi on May 28.

NBC announced on Wednesday it will use AI software to recreate Michaels\u2019 voice to deliver daily recaps of the Summer Games for subscribers of its Peacock streaming platform, a milestone for the use of AI by a major media company. The use of an AI voice for the Olympics comes as the technology has grown by leaps and bounds, particularly in its ability to create images, sound and text. That, in turn, has raised questions in creative industries, such as journalism, about how artificial intelligence can \u2013 or even should \u2013 be used. A new tool, called \u201cYour Daily Olympic Recap on Peacock,\u201d will enable 10-minute highlights packages, which can include events updates, athlete back stories and other related content personalized by subscriber preferences. The company said the highlights could be packaged in about 7 million different ways, pulled from 5,000 hours of live coverage in Paris, effectively making AI (the artificial intelligence, not the man) a significantly more efficient way to deliver personalized recaps.  \u201cWhen I was approached about this, I was skeptical but obviously curious,\u201d Michaels said in a press release. \u201cThen I saw a demonstration detailing what they had in mind. I said, \u2018I\u2019m in.\u2019\u201d A NBC spokesperson told CNN Michaels is being compensated for his involvement.

NBC said the AI system was trained using prior NBC broadcast audio from Michaels. The company said a team of NBC Sports editors will review all of the content, including audio and clips, to make sure everything is factually accurate and names are pronounced correctly.

{"id": "2024_06_01_success_buying-house-in-retirement-mortgage", "text": "Moving somewhere new when you retire isn\u2019t uncommon. But deciding whether to take out a new mortgage to buy a home is a big deal. Much of your financial life is changing as you transition from a steady paycheck to a mix of fixed and variable income and a new lifestyle. So adding a large debt to the picture isn\u2019t an easy call. That\u2019s especially true now that mortgage rates hover around 7% and home prices keep rising. \u201cAny time you take on debt, you increase risk in your situation,\u201d said Illinois-based certified financial planner Jim Stork. More than a third (35%) of homebuyers last year were between the ages of 59 and 98, according to data from the National Association of Realtors. Within that group, a majority financed their purchases. Whether taking out a new mortgage makes sense for you depends on a lot of factors, including how to prove to a lender that you\u2019re a good credit risk, plus your feelings about the debt and the ongoing cost of maintaining a home. To get a mortgage, your age won\u2019t be a factor, but your income will be If you\u2019re concerned that you may be less attractive to a mortgage banker because you\u2019ve hit retirement age, know that it is illegal to discriminate against anyone applying for a mortgage based on their age. Lenders\u2019 chief focus will be on your ability to repay your mortgage with your various sources of non-paycheck income. \u201cWhen you qualify for a mortgage, it\u2019s all based on your income,\u201d said Melissa Cohn, regional vice president at William Raveis Mortgage. That, and of course any debt you have that will soak up your income, but we\u2019ll get to that in a minute. The income sources that lenders consider, absent a regular paycheck, include: Social Security benefits, pension or annuity income, spousal benefits, disability payments, interest and dividends and your 401(k) or IRA. If a portion of your income is not subject to tax, the lender may treat it as worth 25% more. Fannie Mae offers this example: Say 15% of a $1,500 monthly Social Security benefit is tax free. That means $225 of it will not be subject to tax ($1,500 x 15%). And 25% of that amount comes to $56 ($225 x 25%). So that $56 can be added to a person\u2019s qualifying Social Security income amount ($1,500 + $56 = $1,556). If you want to use your nest egg, different methods can be used to calculate how much income it would provide. There is the asset depletion method in which your eligible assets are divided by your loan term. In the case of a 30-year mortgage, that would be 360 months. If your IRA is worth $700,000, that translates into $1,944 per month ($700,000/360). \u201cYou don\u2019t ever have to take the money out \u2014 but you can use your assets [to qualify for a mortgage] as if you were going to take the distribution,\u201d Cohn said. Another option: If you are at least 59-1/2, you can start taking monthly distributions from an IRA without penalty \u2014 or a 401(k) if your plan rules permit \u2014 and the lender will count that as income so long as you show that you have sufficient funds in the account to keep taking that same monthly distribution for three years. Once you close on your home, Cohn said, you can reduce or stop taking distributions if you choose. That assumes you are not yet in your 70s when the IRS requires you to start taking minimum distributions, said Mark Luscombe, a principal analyst at Wolters, Kluwer Tax & Accounting. Burdened by debt? Lenders will also assess your debt-to-income ratio, because no matter how much income you have, the big question is how much of it will be consumed by your debts. The debt portion is composed of your expected mortgage payment plus any credit card, student loan, car loan or other outstanding debt you may have. Generally speaking, for conventional loans your DTI ratio can be up to 50%, Cohen said. That ratio falls to between 43% and 45% if you\u2019re taking out a jumbo loan, she added. A jumbo loan exceeds the conforming loan limits in the area you want to buy. But ideally your debt level will fall well below these top limits, both for the lender\u2019s sake and yours. And, of course, the higher your credit score, the better the interest rate you can get on a mortgage. What you should consider before taking out a mortgage Even before seeking a mortgage, get a good grasp on your expected monthly income and expenses in retirement. Compared to pre-retirement earnings, \u201cMost (new retirees) see a decrease in income,\u201d said certified financial planner Lori Trawinski, director of finance and employment at AARP. While some expenses may also decline \u2014 e.g., work-related costs like commuting \u2014 others may increase over time, Trawinski said, like medical costs, property taxes, home insurance and utilities. Of course, you can downsize and move to a lower-cost area. But if you stay near where you lived during your career, your expenses are likely to rise over time. Also, Trawinski noted, if you\u2019re married, consider what will happen to your household income when one spouse dies. This will help you assess your future comfort level in carrying a mortgage. \u201cPeople often fail to plan for the death of a spouse. You can take a big hit to your income when that happens,\u201d she said. If you do move to a new state or region, weigh renting first. You can get a better sense of the cost of living in the area and decide whether it\u2019s a good fit for you. As Stork put it, \u201cFlorida in August is not as fun as Florida in January.\u201d How much are you really willing to take on? All the usual financial decisions that go into homebuying apply no matter your age. But, in retirement especially, you don\u2019t want to take on more debt than necessary, since the cost of a mortgage is fixed, but the returns on your investments, the housing market and your health needs are variable. At the very least, Stork said, consider whether you can put enough money down \u2014 at least 20% \u2014 to avoid having to pay private mortgage insurance. Beyond that, consider whether you feel comfortable keeping up \u2014 and paying for \u2014 maintenance on a home. Maintenance might amount to 2% a year of your home\u2019s value, Stork said. That amounts to $10,000 a year on a $500,000 home. Maintenance is essential in preserving the value of your house should you ever decide to sell. How would your mortgage interest rate compare to a reasonable rate of return on your investments? The decision to get a mortgage was a lot easier for retirees when rates were historically low \u2014 roughly 3% \u2014 and their nest eggs were earning a lot more. \u201cBut at today\u2019s rates it\u2019s a much harder calculation,\u201d Stork said. This is especially the case if you\u2019re a very conservative investor. \u201cIf your CDs are earning 4% and a mortgage would cost you 7%, you will lose money every day on that decision,\u201d Stork explained. To get the truest reading on what makes financial sense, compare mortgage expenses to your investment returns on an after-tax basis, Stork noted.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/01/success/buying-house-in-retirement-mortgage/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/13/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_05_business_ultra-rich-indian-weddings-economy-intl-hnk", "text": "The wedding of the year is\u00a0here. In less than a week, Anant Ambani, son of Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani, will marry his girlfriend Radhika Merchant. India is no stranger to opulent weddings, but the preparations and parties for this particular union have transfixed the country. Jaw-dropping guest lists, which have included Silicon Valley\u00a0billionaires and Bollywood stars, have underscored Mukesh Ambani\u2019s growing influence in the global economy. Asia\u2019s richest family has also shown off its wealth with a display of jewels evoking the long-gone era of maharajahs and Mughal emperors. And, last week, Justin Bieber became the latest international pop star to entertain at yet another pre-wedding function by the Ambanis in Mumbai. The singer performed at the the sangeet ceremony, a night when the bride and groom\u2019s wedding party dances for guests. It also saw the entire Ambani clan, including Mukesh, on stage dancing to Bollywood\u2019s hit song, Deewangi Deewangi. The Ambanis have set a new benchmark for big, fat Indian weddings, which are bound to grow bigger and louder than ever before as the number of the ultra-rich swells in the world\u2019s fastest-growing major economy. \u201cThe Ambani wedding parties have \u2026 had a multi-faceted impact on the wedding industry in India, influencing trends, boosting demand for wedding vendors, promoting cultural heritage and even driving economic growth,\u201d Tim Chi, CEO of The Knot Worldwide,\u00a0a wedding planning service,\u00a0told CNN. The Indian wedding industry has boomed since the country emerged from the pandemic. Estimated at about $130 billion, it\u2019s now nearly twice the size of America\u2019s, although still smaller than that of China\u2019s, according to a report by Jefferies last month. The industry plays a major role in boosting sectors such as fashion and travel. \u201cAn otherwise value-conscious society, Indians love to spend on weddings,\u201d Jefferies said. \u201cAnd this is irrespective of the economic classes.\u201d At about $15,000, the average Indian wedding costs more than\u00a0three\u00a0times the average annual household income. More than a status symbol Weddings can be expensive affairs in any country, but in India they are especially important as symbols of power and status. Parents in South Asia typically spend a significant portion of their lifetime savings on their children\u2019s weddings, but the scale of many of these events has now become gargantuan, coinciding with India\u2019s rise as an economic powerhouse. \u201cIn the last decade there has been a big shift in Indian weddings across the board,\u201d said Sima Taparia, a\u00a0marriage consultant\u00a0who became a household name in the country after starring in the hit Netflix docuseries \u201cIndian Matchmaking.\u201d It is now common for wealthy Indians to host big weddings at exotic destinations abroad and invite Bollywood actors or famous musicians to perform, she added. \u201cThe Indian wedding is about the power of contacts, the power of relationships and the power of wealth,\u201d said Aditya Motwane, an events planner who founded Motwane Entertainment & Weddings and worked on the wedding of actress Priyanka Chopra\u00a0and singer Nick Jonas\u00a0in 2018. \u201cYou show everyone you know that you\u2019ve arrived in life through these kinds of celebrations,\u201d he added. Indian weddings are often spread across several days, with an average guest list of 326, compared with 115 in the United States, according to The Knot Worldwide. The scale is exponentially\u00a0bigger when it comes to the affluent, whose weddings involve thousands of guests, foreign locations and expensive gifts. Ambani\u2019s\u00a0three-day pre-wedding party in the western Indian city of Jamnagar in March was\u00a0attended by around 1,200 high-profile guests, including Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates. It is not uncommon for the very wealthy to spend many millions on the festivities. At the Ambani party, an elaborate light show featuring 5,500 drones lit up the sky above a glass palace custom-built for the festivities, where guests danced to a performance by none other than Rihanna. The outrageously rich also come up with some unusual requests. One couple asked Motwane to arrange for an elephant \u2014 a sacred animal to Hindus \u2014 to be in Monte Carlo to bless them. With India set to become the world\u2019s third-largest economy by 2027, extravagant weddings are expected to become even more frequent. According to a report from real estate consultancy Knight Frank, the number of Indians with a net worth of at least $30 million will rise by 50% over the five years to 2028, the biggest increase of any country. And, lower down the economic ladder, by 2030 some 600 million Indians are projected to be middle-class, a segment that will represent over 80% of the country\u2019s spending power. \u201cAs the middle class grows, so does their disposable income, which inevitably is spent on lavish parties and celebrations,\u201d said Tina Tharwani, co-founder of wedding planning company Shaadi Squad. Rihanna, couture and emeralds The average luxury Indian wedding can cost anywhere between $200,000 and $400,000, according to Jefferies. This kind of budget allows for accommodation at five-star hotels across the world, sumptuous catering, decor and entertainment, and sometimes includes Bollywood actors or international singers. But the Jefferies cost estimate does not include expenses on jewelry or attire. Bridal spending accounts for over half of the total jewelry market it India, the bank noted. The country is one of the largest markets for gold, but its appetite for diamonds and other precious gems is also growing. The emerald necklace worn by Nita Ambani, the groom\u2019s mother, at the festivities in March stunned the internet with its size and sparkle. No luxury Indian wedding\u00a0is complete without\u00a0lavish meals, which at times involves flying in Michelin star chefs and the finest of ingredients from across the world. An extra layer of expense is often added to the budget because many Indians don\u2019t eat meat, and some avoid root vegetables as well. Motwane recalls planning a wedding in Florence where many guests did not eat garlic or onion. The Italian cooks \u201chit the roof,\u201d he said. A renowned Indian Italian chef and her team were then flown in. A range of other businesses are poised for growth as Ambani-style high-profile weddings lead to a \u201ctrickle-down effect,\u201d setting \u201cnew trends and standards (and) influencing couples\u2019 expectations,\u201d said Tharwani, who worked on Indian cricketer\u00a0Virat Kohli\u2019s wedding in Tuscany. Vanessa Almeida, who looked after packaging and delivery of some 8,000 gifts for Ambani\u2019s guests at the jamboree in March, told CNN that similar party favors are becoming sought-after across the country. Of the many expensive\u00a0presents that the family showered upon its A-list guests \u2014 from silver candle sticks and shawls to\u00a0terrariums and bird houses \u2014 customized leather products\u00a0are among those that have caught on, said Almeida, owner of The Gift House in Goa. Demand for wedding videographers has also boomed in the last decade, with companies charging as much as $10,000 for a film. Many couples also shoot pre-wedding videos, which are painstakingly choreographed and\u00a0inspired by Bollywood musicals. \u201cBrides and grooms go for pre-wedding shoots across the globe,\u201d said Taparia. Local economy The rise in opulent celebrations held abroad has led to some consternation among the local communities, wedding planners say. In late May, the Ambanis held a four-day Mediterranean cruise for friends and family, with a bevy of Bollywood stars and performances by Katy Perry, the Backstreet Boys and Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli. Not everyone was impressed. The partygoers drew the ire of residents in the port city of Genoa, according to media reports, as they kept several neighborhoods awake with loud music until dawn. But, despite the occasional inconvenience, such functions also generate revenue and employment in the area. \u201cYou\u2019re looking at a minimum of 2-3 million euros coming in over three days,\u201d said Motwane. The Indian government is now trying to get a bigger chunk of the luxury wedding revenue, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi launching a \u201cWed in India\u201d campaign to encourage affluent families to get married in the country. \u201cPeople often spend significant amounts of money to get married abroad,\u201d Modi said in March. But by hosting weddings in India, \u201cfamilies can enjoy lavish celebrations for three to four days, providing livelihood opportunities for locals.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/business/ultra-rich-indian-weddings-economy-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/13/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_11_business_cdk-hack-ransom-tweny-five-million-dollars", "text": "CDK Global, a software firm serving car dealerships across the US that was roiled by a cyberattack last month, appears to have paid a $25 million ransom to the hackers, multiple sources familiar with the matter told CNN. The company has declined to discuss the matter. Pinpointing exactly who sends a cryptocurrency payment can be complicated by the relative anonymity that some crypto services offer. But data on the blockchain that underpins cryptocurrency payments also tells its own story. On June 21, about 387 bitcoin \u2014\u00a0then the equivalent of roughly $25 million \u2014\u00a0was sent to a cryptocurrency account controlled by hackers affiliated with a type of ransomware called BlackSuit, Chris Janczewski, head of global investigations at crypto-tracking firm TRM Labs, told CNN. A week after the payment was made, CDK said that it was bringing car dealers back online to its software platform. Cryptocurrency allows for the exchange of digital assets outside of the traditional banking system, but a record of those transactions is accessible on the blockchain. Janczewski did not identify who sent the payment, but three\u00a0other sources closely tracking the incident confirmed that a roughly $25 million payment had been made to BlackSuit affiliates and that CDK was very likely the source of that payment.\u00a0Those sources spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the investigation. The cryptocurrency account that sent the ransom payment is affiliated with a firm that helps victims respond to ransom attacks, one of the sources said, declining to identify the firm. CDK spokesperson Lisa Finney did not respond to multiple requests for comment on Wednesday and Thursday on the apparent payment. Finney  previously declined to answer questions on the subject.\u00a0CDK CEO Brian MacDonald did not respond to email and LinkedIn messages seeking comment. The ransom payment of $25 million hasn\u2019t been previously reported. Bloomberg\u00a0reported that the hackers had made a multimillion-dollar ransom demand and that the company planned to pay. The ransomware attack that hit CDK in mid-June disrupted thousands of auto dealerships that use the company\u2019s software to manage everything from scheduling to sales and orders.\u00a0CDK\u00a0referred to it as a \u201ccyber incident\u201d in statements to reporters. In a note to clients cited by\u00a0CBS, CDK referred to it as a \u201ccyber ransom event.\u201d CDK said last week that \u201csubstantially all\u201d of the nearly 15,000 car dealerships that use its software across North America were back online to its core management system. Federal officials generally discourage paying a ransom to cybercriminals because payments can fuel future attacks. But some companies feel they have no choice but to pay off hackers to try to recover sensitive customer data or get their systems back online. The payment would be a windfall for a\u00a0relatively new brand\u00a0of ransomware criminals that emerged last year and has claimed numerous victims in the education and construction sectors, among others. BlackSuit\u2019s malicious software is similar to that previously used by other Russian-speaking criminal groups,\u00a0according\u00a0to the US Department of Health and Human Services. \u201cThe gang\u2019s leadership has been conducting ransomware extortion operations since 2019 under other ransomware brand names,\u201d said Jon DiMaggio, chief security strategist at cybersecurity firm Analyst1 who closely studies ransomware gangs. \u201cThis is one of many examples I have seen over the years where a group is either shut down by law enforcement or decides to terminate its operation to rebrand under a new name and continue attacking and extorting organizations,\u201d DiMaggio told CNN, adding that most of BlackSuit\u2019s victims have been in the US. Cybercriminals, in general, extorted a record $1.1 billion in ransom payments from victim organizations around the world last year despite US government efforts to cut off their money flows, Chainalysis, another crypto-tracking firm,\u00a0said in a report\u00a0in February. A $25 million ransom payment is certainly large but not unheard of in the lucrative ransomware economy. UnitedHealth Group, the health care conglomerate whose subsidiary suffered a ransomware attack in February that hobbled pharmacies across the US, paid a $22 million ransom to a different criminal group. But the average ransom payment in the fourth quarter of 2023 was significantly lower: $568,705,\u00a0according\u00a0to cybersecurity firm Coveware.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/business/cdk-hack-ransom-tweny-five-million-dollars/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/13/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_11_economy_us-cpi-consumer-inflation-june", "text": "Americans weighed down by fast-rising prices for three years just received more encouraging news on the inflation front. The Consumer Price Index, a measurement of the average change in prices for a commonly purchased basket of goods and services, dropped 0.1% from May, which helped to slow the annual rate of inflation to 3% from 3.3% in May, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 latest report. Falling gas prices as well as a drop in new and used car prices helped to usher in the first month-on-month decline since May 2020, BLS data showed. On an annual basis, consumer prices are increasing at their slowest pace since June 2023, matching the lowest annual rate since early 2021. The better-than-expected inflation report further bolstered hopes that a Federal Reserve rate cut could come sooner than later and help make borrowing money less expensive. Interest rates have been planted for months at a 23-year high as a result of the central bank\u2019s inflation-fighting campaign. \u201cWith another good CPI print under their belt, the window is open for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates as early as September, and potentially again in December, assuming the inflation data continues to cooperate,\u201d Skyler Weinand, chief investment officer at Regan Capital, wrote Thursday in a note to clients. Economists were expecting a 0.1% monthly increase and an annual gain of 3.1%, according to FactSet consensus estimates. Excluding energy and food prices, a closely watched \u201ccore\u201d index of underlying inflation also slowed more than expected. The core CPI rose 0.1% from May \u2014 its slowest pace since August 2021 \u2014 nudging the annual rate of core inflation lower, to 3.3% from 3.4%, and marking a fresh three-year low. US stocks jumped on the news but quickly gave up those initial gains and settled lower. The blue-chip Dow\u00a0fell 90 points in morning trading. The S&P 500 dipped into negative territory and the tech-heavy Nasdaq was flat. US Treasury yields fell, which could be good news for consumers: Loans like mortgages are tied to the 10-year yield. Odds of Fed cutting are growing \u2014 but so are the risks Wall Street is growing increasingly confident that cooling inflation will allow the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates in the coming months. Investors are now pricing in an 89% chance of at least one rate cut by the September 17-18 Fed meeting, according to CME Group\u2019s\u00a0FedWatch Tool. That\u2019s up from 73% on Wednesday and around 50% a week ago. The Fed\u2019s calculus also has shifted somewhat, as the US labor market has become noticeably cooler, with unemployment ticking up for three months in a row to land at 4.1% in June. \u201cIt would be perfectly reasonable, in our opinion, to cut rates in July; however, the Fed is bound by its forward guidance and backward-looking mantra and won\u2019t move until September,\u201d Tuan Nguyen, economist at RSM US, told CNN in an interview on Thursday. \u201cAnything after that will put the economy at serious risk of hitting a hard landing.\u201d Shelter inflation eases While falling gas prices did a fair share of the heavy lifting in cooling inflation, the latest CPI showed progress in a critical area: Shelter. \u201cShelter\u00a0and services costs have been the longstanding and persistent trouble spots in the inflation readings, but maybe the tide is starting to turn,\u201d Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate, said in a statement. The shelter index rose just 0.2% during June, the slowest monthly increase in three years. On an annual basis, shelter-related price-hikes rose 5.2%, the coolest reading in two years but still running above overall inflation. Shelter inflation remains the biggest hurdle to CPI slowing (the category itself is about one-third of the overall CPI). Economists have anticipated a slowdown for quite some time now, as market-rate rents have slowed, but how they\u2019re recorded in the CPI comes with a significant lag, and tabulating overall housing cost inflation is an amorphous process of estimating the rental value of owner-occupied homes. Cheaper hotel and motel prices helped in the sharp cooling of the overall shelter index (they fell 2.5% for the month); however, rent and owners\u2019 equivalent rents both slowed on a monthly and annual basis. \u201cToday, the shelter component has finally caught up with what we have been predicting for more than a year now,\u201d RSM\u2019s Nguyen said. \u201cAnd that (moderation) should continue to be the case in the second half of the year.\u201d Retailers cutting prices for cost-wary consumers In recent months, a slew of major retailers have announced price cuts. That trend very well could continue as consumers become more restrained, House said. \u201cI think you have seen consumers feel and act increasingly strained, and that\u2019s going to make it harder for businesses to pass on prices as we moved throughout the year,\u201d Wells Fargo\u2019s House told CNN earlier this week. \u201c(Discounting) also pressures other retailers. If they want to keep their share of the pie, they\u2019re going to have to compete more on price, given that consumers are more squeezed at this stage of the cycle.\u201d Core goods prices fell on a monthly basis by 0.1% and are down 1.8% for the 12 months ended in June, according to Thursday\u2019s BLS report. Food prices saw a modest uptick last month, rising 0.2% overall with grocery and restaurant prices increasing 0.1% and 0.4%, respectively. Long-lasting effects of high inflation Prices may not be rising as quickly as they have been, but that might not bring much solace to American households who see that the overall CPI is a good 20% higher than it was in February 2020. (In recent history, that index would typically rise about 10% over a 54-month period, BLS data shows). The sticker shock of the past three years could leave a lasting impression on consumer behavior, said Michael Weber, an associate professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business who has studied how inflation surges affect consumer behavior. \u201cFor many consumers, when we look at the price tags, walking down the aisles of the supermarket, that price tag compared to two, three years ago will be permanently higher, given the cumulative inflation we\u2019ve witnessed over the last three years,\u201d Weber told CNN in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s ingrained in the memory,\u201d he added. The Fed closely monitors gauges of near-, medium- and long-term inflation expectations as those could be self-fulfilling prophecies for consumers: If people think prices will be higher in the future, they might spend more now or even demand higher wages. In turn, businesses faced with higher costs might end up raising prices as a result. While Americans\u2019 near-term inflation expectations have lessened, the fallout from high prices is being seen on a grander stage: The US presidential election. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t economists, they don\u2019t think like economists, they don\u2019t look at the rate of change in consumer prices \u2026 they\u2019re looking at how much a dozen eggs cost now compared to two years ago,\u201d Bernard Yaros, lead US economist at Oxford Economics, told CNN. \u201cThis is really where I think Biden has gotten dinged by, in terms of his public image of his handling of the economy.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/economy/us-cpi-consumer-inflation-june/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/13/2024", "section": "business"}}

Dozens of Dollar General workers and customers have been killed at stores over the past decade, and the company has faced worker protests and millions in fines from regulators for unsafe store conditions. The Labor Department said Dollar General agreed to hire new safety managers, provide safety and health training to workers and develop a safety and health committee. Dollar General will also reduce merchandise levels in stores to prevent blocked fire exits. The agreement also requires Dollar General to correct any safety violations related to blocked exits or access to fire extinguishers and electrical panels within 48 hours. Dollar General could face fines up to $500,000 per violation. \u201cThese changes help give peace of mind to thousands of workers, knowing that they are not risking their safety in their workplaces and that they will come home healthy at the end of each day,\u201d Douglas Parker, the head of the Department of Labor\u2019s Occupational Safety and Health division, said in a statement. This settlement resolves existing contested inspections as well as open federal inspections involving alleged violations. Dollar General did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment. Last year, the Labor Department agreed to a settlement with Dollar Tree to improve worker safety in stores. Both chains have a low-cost business model, allowing them to keep their prices down and open in areas competitors like Walmart and Target have bypassed. But this model often means only one or two workers making the minimum wage oversee stores at a time, making it nearly impossible for employees to stock shelves and keep stores well maintained. Dollar General is the fastest-growing retailer in the United States, with more than 19,000 small stores. The company has boomed, typically in small towns, due to the shrinking middle class and income inequality in the United States.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/business/dollar-general-safety-violations/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/13/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_07_11_economy_fast-food-value-meal-prices", "text": "Value is the new buzzword at fast-food chains nationwide. After rising prices turned customers off, the restaurants recently responded by unveiling value menus. For instance, McDonald\u2019s has a $5 value meal, which includes a McDouble cheeseburger\u00a0or a McChicken sandwich, plus small french fries, 4-piece chicken nuggets and a small soft drink. At Taco Bell, you can now get two different kinds of tacos, a five-layer burrito, chips with nacho cheese sauces and a medium drink for $7. That\u2019s 55% cheaper than ordering the items individually. Like McDonald\u2019s, Burger King is offering a $5 meal bundle where customers can select one of three kinds of burgers to pair with chicken nuggets and a beverage. But just how much value is there in these kinds of \u201cvalue\u201d meals? Well, actually, not as much as you may think, since prices for many key ingredients used in value meals are coming down. In other words: You\u2019re paying the going rate (or more). Cheese, potatoes and tomatoes are getting cheaper Many of the recently announced value meals use cheese, potatoes and tomatoes. Compared to last June, cheese prices are down 2.1%, tomato prices are down 1.1% and potato prices are down 3.9%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 latest Consumer Price Index report released Thursday. On a monthly basis, cheese prices didn\u2019t change in June. Tomato and potato prices slid by 0.3% and 3.3%, respectively, when adjusting for seasonality. Meat eaters benefit the most from the value meal war If you eat meat, you\u2019re more likely to benefit from some value menu items. That\u2019s because meat prices are up 3.5% for the year. From May to June, though, meat prices fell by 0.3%. Beef prices were among the steepest price increases across all meat categories tracked in the CPI. For instance, beef roast prices are up 10% and ground beef prices are up 4.5% compared to last June. Pork prices are also up 3.8% compared to a year ago. But prices are a bit lower compared to last month. Chicken prices rose more modestly over the course of the year, up just 0.5%. On a monthly basis, they fell by 0.2% in June. Given that meat prices are rising at a faster pace than most foods, it\u2019s no wonder most fast-food chains are only offering value menus for a limited time. In effect, they\u2019re maintaining their ability to raise prices in the future. But for the time being, Joe Erlinger, president of McDonald\u2019s USA, said value meals aren\u2019t a loss leader for the company and that \u201cwe are totally comfortable with the profitability of it.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a way to really bring value and affordability to our customers at a time when the consumer is really stretched,\u201d he said at a conference hosted by The Wall Street Journal last month. Dining out remains a luxury for many Another consideration: It\u2019s a lot more expensive to dine out than cook at home. That shouldn\u2019t be surprising since there are a lot more costs associated with dining out \u2014 one of the biggest being labor \u2014 that aren\u2019t incurred at home. But you\u2019re likely to experience more sticker shock dining out than shopping at grocery stores. Last month, food prices overall rose by 0.2% from May. For the year, food prices are up 2.2%. Food in stores cost 1.1% more compared to a year ago, and those prices are up 0.1% on a monthly basis.

{"id": "2024_07_03_tech_elevenlabs-ai-celebrity-voices", "text": "Actress Judy Garland never recorded her voice to read an audiobook of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, but you\u2019ll soon be able to hear her rendition of the children\u2019s novel that inspired the movie nonetheless. Earlier this week, AI company ElevenLabs said it is bringing digitally produced celebrity voice-overs of deceased actors, including Garland, James Dean and Burt Reynolds, to its newly launched Reader app. The company said the app takes articles, PDF, ePub, newsletters, e-books or any other text on your phone and turns it into voice-overs.  \u201cWe deeply respect their legacy and are honored to have their voices as part of our platform,\u201d said Dustin Blank, head of partnerships at ElevenLabs. \u201cAdding them to our growing list of narrators marks a major step forward in our mission of making content accessible in any language and voice.\u201d The company said it made deals with the estates of the actors whose voices are being used, but did not share details about compensation. The effort shows the potential of artificial intelligence for Hollywood but also sets a precedent for licensing and working with estates. It also comes at a time when the technology has grown by leaps and bounds, particularly in its ability to create images, text and sound, making it easy for anyone to create a version of someone\u2019s voice saying something they never did. That, in turn, has raised questions in creative industries such as journalism and film about how artificial intelligence can \u2014 or even should \u2014 be used. ElevenLabs previously made headlines earlier this year when its tool was reportedly used to create a fake robocall from President Joe Biden urging people not to vote in New Hampshire\u2019s presidential primary. Copyright questions and authenticity The partnership with the stars\u2019 estates comes two months after ChatGPT-maker OpenAI came under fire after introducing a synthetic voice that was eerily similar to Scarlett Johansson\u2019s character in the film \u201cHer.\u201d Johansson said in a statement shared with CNN that she was \u201cshocked, angered and in disbelief\u201d that the company would use her likeliness likeness after she turned down a partnership opportunity with OpenAI. Although a person can\u2019t copyright their own voice, it\u2019s possible to copyright a recording, according to David Gunkel, a professor at the department of communications at Northern Illinois University who tracks AI in media and entertainment. The AI is trained on old recordings and those recordings are under copyright. \u201cElevenLabs\u2019 new partnerships are all well within the realm of what the law allows,\u201d he said. \u201cAn estate will get a considerable amount of money from licensing and agreements. It\u2019s not unlike a company negotiating a copyright deal to use a popular song by Queen in an ad. The record company also could in theory say no, no matter how much money they\u2019re offered.\u201d Bern Elliot, a vice president and analyst at market research firm Gartner, said AI models can now be trained on fewer audio recordings; very little is needed to capture tone, speech patterns and other elements, whether it\u2019s for a celebrity or an everyday person. \u201cThe bigger concern is determining what the owner of those recordings can or can\u2019t do to monetize the voice,\u201d he said. Media companies are also ramping up their use of AI for voiceovers. Last week, NBC announced it is bringing an AI-version version of famed sportscaster Al Michaels back to the Olympics this summer, in daily recaps on its Peacock streaming platform. An NBC spokesperson told CNN that Michaels is being compensated for his involvement. It\u2019s unclear, however, how AI versions of well-known voices will be received by mass audiences and if it will raise concerns around authenticity. \u201cWe don\u2019t know yet the supposed market for these types of things but you can already see with audiobooks that ones read by recognizable voices and celebrities are a hot commodity,\u201d Gunkel said. \u201cIf there\u2019s a way to have a celebrity do all kinds of content and not voice it themselves, that could open up the market even wider.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/tech/elevenlabs-ai-celebrity-voices/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/13/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk", "text": "In a year of wild tech stories that has seen Elon Musk transform Twitter, cryptocurrency exchange FTX collapse and Silicon Valley Bank implode, this week\u2019s whiplash-inducing turmoil at OpenAI is among the most captivating. Sam Altman \u2014 the leader of one of the world\u2019s most influential AI companies, OpenAI, and perhaps the\u00a0most visible figure in the fledgling industry \u2014 was fired Friday night by the startup\u2019s directors in a surprise move. Less than five days later, he\u2019s back as the company\u2019s CEO, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. The series of extraordinary events unfolded just days after OpenAI held its\u00a0first-ever developer conference, where it laid out new, commercialized versions of its technology, including the option to customize its ChatGPT AI chatbot. If you\u2019re just catching up, here\u2019s what you missed from a week so incredible you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking the script could have been written by an early version of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Friday Around 3 p.m. ET, Altman joined a Google Meet call with most of OpenAI\u2019s board that had been convened by fellow co-founder and OpenAI chief scientist\u00a0Ilya Sutskever, during which Altman was fired and told that the news would soon be made public. Within the next half hour, the board also informed Greg Brockman, another co-founder and OpenAI president, that he would be removed from the board. Around 3:30 p.m. ET, OpenAI publicly announced that it had fired Altman over concerns that he was not always truthful with the board. The board said Mira Murati, the company\u2019s chief technology officer, would become interim CEO. OpenAI\u2019s strategic partners, including its biggest financial backer Microsoft, were also reportedly informed of Altman\u2019s ouster just minutes before the board\u2019s announcement. Hours after being fired, Altman posted on X that he \u201cloved working with such talented people\u201d and that he would have \u201cmore to say about what\u2019s next later.\u201d Brockman promptly quit. \u201cPlease don\u2019t spend any time being concerned. We will be fine,\u201d Brockman\u00a0said in a Friday post\u00a0on X. \u201cGreater things coming soon.\u201d A key factor in the CEO\u2019s firing was\u00a0tension between Altman, who favored developing AI\u00a0more aggressively, and members of the OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the unfolding events. Saturday Within 24 hours of Altman being fired, reports emerged that he and other ex-OpenAI loyalists were mulling plans for their own venture. OpenAI\u2019s board was also reportedly having second thoughts and considering asking the ousted CEO to return. Sunday By Sunday afternoon, Altman was\u00a0back at OpenAI\u2019s headquarters\u00a0\u2014 this time with a guest badge \u2014 to negotiate his potential return. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reportedly mediated the discussion. A 5 p.m. PT deadline was reportedly set for the board to agree to Altman\u2019s demands, including adding a seat for Microsoft, and reinstating him as CEO. But those talks broke down. As Sunday turned into Monday, Nadella tweeted that Altman, along with Brockman, would join Microsoft to run a new AI research group. At OpenAI, the group found a new interim CEO: Emmett Shear, the former CEO of Amazon\u2019s streaming service, Twitch. Murati would return to her role as OpenAI\u2019s chief technology officer. Monday In a post on X early Monday, Shear, who left his role at Twitch in March, described the chance to join OpenAI as \u201ca once-in-a-lifetime\u201d opportunity. He added that the company would hire an independent investigator to report on what happened in the lead-up to Altman\u2019s firing. But OpenAI employees were not convinced. More than 500 staffers signed an open letter calling on the company\u2019s board to resign and reinstate Altman and Brockman. They also threatened to follow the co-founders to Microsoft if their demands were not met. Altman posted on X, saying, \u201cwe have more unity and commitment and focus than ever before. we are all going to work together some way or other, and i\u2019m so excited. one team, one mission.\u201d The drama was far from over.\u00a0The Verge reported Monday afternoon\u00a0that Altman and Brockman could still return to OpenAI if the board members who fired him resign. And Nadella, speaking to CNBC, said he was \u201copen to both options\u201d when asked whether Altman would actually join Microsoft. \u201cLook, that is for the OpenAI board and management and the employees to choose,\u201d Nadella said. \u201cWe chose to explicitly partner with OpenAI and we want to continue to do so, and obviously, that depends on the people of OpenAI staying there or coming to Microsoft.\u201d Tuesday Altman\u00a0was reinstated late Tuesday as OpenAI\u2019s CEO, the company said on X. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman\u00a0wrote\u00a0that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his\u00a0post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it has backed with billions to bolster its ambitions in developing AI. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Nadella\u00a0said\u00a0on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/13/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_12_business_att-customers-massive-breach", "text": "The call and text message records from mid-to-late 2022 of tens of millions of AT&T cellphone customers and many non-AT&T customers were exposed in a massive data breach, the telecom company revealed Friday. AT&T said the compromised data includes the telephone numbers of \u201cnearly all\u201d of its cellular customers and the customers of wireless providers that use its network between May 1, 2022 and October 31, 2022. The stolen logs also contain a record of every number AT&T customers called or texted \u2013 including customers of other wireless networks \u2013 the number of times they interacted, and the call duration. Importantly, AT&T said the stolen data did not include the contents of calls and text messages nor the time of those communications. The records of a \u201cvery small number\u201d of customers from January 2, 2023, were also implicated, AT&T said. \u201cWe have an ongoing investigation into the AT&T breach and we\u2019re coordinating with our law enforcement partners,\u201d the FCC said on social media platform X. The company\u00a0blamed\u00a0an \u201cillegal download\u201d on a third-party cloud platform that it learned about in April \u2013 just as the company was grappling with an\u00a0unrelated major data leak. AT&T says that the exposed data is not believed to be publicly available, however CNN was unable to independently verify that assertion. AT&T spokesperson Alex Byers told CNN that this was an entirely new incident that had \u201cno connection in any way\u201d to another incident disclosed in March. At that time, AT&T said personal information such as Social Security numbers on 73 million current and former customers was released onto the dark web. \u201cWe sincerely regret this incident occurred and remain committed to protecting the information in our care,\u201d the company said in a statement about the latest breach. AT&T listed approximately 110 million wireless subscribers as of the end of 2022. AT&T said international calls were not included in the stolen data, with the exception of calls to Canada. The breach also included AT&T landline customers who interacted with those cell numbers. AT&T said that contents of the calls or texts, personal information such as Social Security numbers, dates of birth, or customer names were not exposed in this incident, however the company acknowledged that publicly available tools can often link names with specific phone numbers. Additionally, AT&T said that for an undisclosed subset of its records, one or more cell site identification numbers linked to the calls and texts were also exposed. Such data could reveal the broad geographic location of one or more of the parties. AT&T believes that at least one person involved in the cybercriminal incident is in custody, the company said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The FBI declined to comment when asked about that statement. AT&T promised to notify current and former customers whose information was involved and provide them resources to protect their information. Usage details such as the time of calls and text messages were not compromised either. But AT&T spokesperson Byers told CNN that the number of calls and text messages, and total call durations for specific days or months were exposed. That means the data would not identify precisely when one phone number called another but could reveal how often two parties called each other \u2013 and how long they spoke for \u2013 on specific days. AT&T said it learned on April 19 that a \u201cthreat actor claimed to have unlawfully accessed and copied AT&T call logs.\u201d The company said it \u201cimmediately\u201d hired experts and a subsequent investigation determined hackers had exfiltrated files between April 14 and April 25. Justice Department delays public disclosure The company said the US Department of Justice Department determined in May and in June that a delay in public disclosure was warranted. The FBI said AT&T reached out shortly after learning about the hack, but the agency wanted to review the data for potential national security or public safety risks. \u201cIn assessing the nature of the breach, all parties discussed a potential delay to public reporting\u2026 due to potential risks to national security and/or public safety,\u201d the FBI said in a statement. \u201cAT&T, FBI, and DOJ worked collaboratively through the first and second delay process, all while sharing key threat intelligence to bolster FBI investigative equities and to assist AT&T\u2019s incident response work.\u201d This appears to be the first cyber incident in which the Justice Department has asked a company to delay filing a disclosure with the SEC because of potential national security or public safety concerns. \u201cThis is very concerning. This information is very valuable to cyber criminals and to nation-states,\u201d Sanaz Yashar, co-founder and CEO of cybersecurity firm Zafran, told CNN. Yashar, previously an Israeli cyber spy, said threat actors can correlate the cell ID data with other information readily available to pinpoint where someone works \u2013 including at sensitive locations like the White House and Pentagon. \u201cYou don\u2019t need the timestamp. If someone is there everyday, you can understand they work there and their routine. This is very secret information and a way that spies do stuff.\u201d Justin Sherman, founder of Global Cyber Strategies, a consultancy, also put the potential threat in stark terms. \u201cMetadata about who\u2019s communicating with who, at massive scale, enables someone to map connections between people \u2014 think journalists and sources, intelligence officers and their contacts, married people and those with whom they\u2019re having an affair,\u201d Sherman told CNN. Jason Hogg, a former FBI special agent who is now executive-in-residence at Great Hill Partners, said the cell site data is \u201cquite significant because it could allow bad actors to determine certain consumers\u2019 geolocation, which could be used to make the social engineering attacks more believable.\u201d AT&T shares fell 1% on Friday following the news. In the new incident, AT&T told CNN it learned in April that customer data was illegally downloaded from its workspace on Snowflake, a third-party cloud platform. AT&T is only the latest major company to have data stolen via access to their Snowflake platform. Ticketmaster and Santander Bank have also recently disclosed massive data breaches linked to Snowflake. Mandiant, a Google-owned cybersecurity firm, has notified at least 165 organizations that they may have been affected by the hacking spree. Mandiant analysts said they have \u201cmoderate confidence\u201d that the hackers are based in North America and that they collaborate with an additional person in Turkey. Brad Jones, chief information security officer at Snowflake, told CNN in a separate statement that the company has not found evidence this activity was \u201ccaused by a vulnerability, misconfiguration or breach of Snowflake\u2019s platform.\u201d Jones said this has been verified by investigations by third-party cybersecurity experts at Mandiant and CrowdStrike. AT&T said it launched an investigation, hired cybersecurity experts and took steps to close the \u201cillegal access point.\u201d This story has been updated with additional context and developments.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/12/business/att-customers-massive-breach/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/13/2024", "section": "business"}}

The July 3 interview\u00a0with\u00a0WAUK-AM\u00a0host Earl Ingram\u00a0was one of Biden\u2019s first media engagements following his poor performance at the\u00a0June 27\u00a0CNN Presidential Debate. The revelations of the requested edits come as the press corps, frustrated by how the White House has handled their questions about Biden\u2019s health and acuity, is about to face Biden for the first time since the debate at a press conference Thursday during the NATO summit. On Thursday, Civic Media, a Wisconsin-based radio network, posted the edited clips and the entire unedited interview on its website. The edited clips, it said, included Biden saying: \u201c\u2026and in addition to that, I have more Blacks in my administration than any other president, all other presidents combined, and in major positions, cabinet positions.\u201d Another clip included the removal of a reference to former President Donald Trump\u2019s call for the death penalty for the so-called Central Park Five. \u201cI don\u2019t know if they even call for their hanging or not, but he\u2013but they said (\u2026) convicted of murder,\u201d Biden said. A Biden campaign spokesperson acknowledged it had asked the station to edit the interview. \u201cHosts have always been free to ask the questions and air the segments they think will best inform their listeners,\u201d the spokesperson said. Civic Media CEO Sage Weil\u00a0said in a statement that\u00a0the station was made aware on Monday that \u201cimmediately after the phone interview was recorded, the Biden campaign called and asked for two edits to the recording before it aired.\u201d \u201cGiven the gravity of the current political moment, the stakes in this election, and the importance of public scrutiny of public officials in the highest office, we believe it is important to share this information,\u201d Weil said. Weil said management determined that \u201cthe production team at the time viewed the edits as non-substantive and broadcast and published the interview with two short segments removed.\u201d He added that \u201cCivic Media disagrees with the team\u2019s judgments in the moment\u201d and that they are clarifying their internal polices \u201cto ensure that everyone in the organization understands the standards we expect for live and pre-recorded interviews.\u201d Despite the edits, Civic Media \u201cunequivocally stands by Earl Ingram and his team,\u201d saying that the edits were made in \u201cgood faith\u201d even if leadership at Civic Media \u201cdisagree with the decision.\u201d Earlier this week, another radio host, Andrea Lawful-Sanders,\u00a0resigned\u00a0from the Philadelphia station WURD after she told CNN that her\u00a0post-debate interview with President Joe Biden\u00a0included questions that were pre-selected by Biden\u2019s campaign team. WURD later said they had parted ways with Lawful-Sanders over the incident.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/media/milwaukee-radio-station-biden/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/13/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_07_02_media_biden-mental-fitness", "text": "President Joe Biden\u2019s White House repeatedly and aggressively shot down reports\u00a0on\u00a0the president\u2019s age and any possible limitations\u00a0on his ability to perform all the duties of his office. But after his shaky debate performance last week, in which Biden routinely struggled to\u00a0get his point across, some in the White House press corps say they wish they had pushed harder to tell the story. In June, when the Wall Street Journal published a\u00a0lengthy piece\u00a0on President Joe Biden\u2019s mental\u00a0state, the newspaper\u00a0got\u00a0slammed.\u00a0The White House, its allies, and\u00a0some in the media\u00a0\u2013\u00a0including CNN\u2019s Reliable Sources\u00a0\u2013\u00a0criticized the Journal for quoting mostly Republican political foes on the record, who had a clear political motive to damage Biden\u2019s image. No Democrats were quoted on the record making those allegations, and several Democrats complained their on-the-record quotes praising Biden\u2019s sharpness were not included. The\u00a0Journal defended its reporting at the time. Last week\u2019s debate on CNN laid bare many of the concerns the Journal\u2019s reporting had raised \u2013 that the president has good days and bad days but can sometimes seem to slip up. A New York Times report on Tuesday raised similar concerns by those who have recently been in the room with Biden. The Times reported Biden has more frequent \u201clapses,\u201d although at other times he appears sharp. After Biden\u2019s lackluster performance last week, some are questioning whether the White House press corps dropped the ball on fully covering Biden\u2019s limitations. Biden\u2019s\u00a0age issue is not secret or new. Nearly every media outlet has reported on\u00a0growing concerns about\u00a0Biden\u2019s age well before the debate. The White House in the past has complained that the coverage is disproportionate, and that the media is spending more time covering Biden\u2019s age than his accomplishments as president versus former President Donald Trump\u2019s lies. The media has faced accusations that it has not covered Biden\u2019s mental fitness more aggressively because it wants to prop up the campaign in some way \u2013 an accusation the White House reporters CNN spoke to denied. Several White House reporters\u00a0told CNN that\u00a0the\u00a0coverage\u00a0of Biden\u2019s age and his mental stamina\u00a0should have\u00a0pushed harder. They cited several difficulties in doing so before the debate \u2013 from the obvious political motivations of sources who either want to protect Biden\u2019s image or project a certain image, to the blowback from pursuing such reports, especially from the White House and Democrats. A difficult task Like all past presidents, Biden has good days and bad days. It\u00a0can be tricky to report on something as difficult to define as a person aging, when his opponent\u00a0is a convicted felon, who regularly lies and has threatened to use the government to go after his political opponents. Still, some reporters said the press corps\u00a0could\u00a0have done a better job\u00a0covering\u00a0Biden\u2019s physical and mental state. The failure of the media, one White House reporter said,\u00a0was\u00a0not\u00a0pushing more aggressively\u00a0into Biden\u2019s abilities after the release of the Robert Hurr report in February, which called Biden a \u201cwell-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.\u201d Biden\u2019s age was also a right-wing talking point for years, something the White House was quick to point out to reporters,\u00a0which\u00a0may have inadvertently turned off any serious investigation. For example, deceptively edited clips of Biden from the G7 spread widely by right-wing media figures were made to seem as though he was aimlessly \u201cwandering off\u201d from fellow world leaders when really, he was speaking to parachutists who had just landed during a demonstration. \u201cThe right-wing media was calling him senile from day one, and that wasn\u2019t true,\u201d the reporter said. \u201cThen whenever you report on the age you were in some ways solidifying, giving credence to some people that were actually of bad faith.\u201d All the White House reporters who spoke to CNN for this piece chose to speak anonymously so they could speak more freely about their relationship with the White House. Keeping the president at a distance Reporters said the White House has not made the press corps\u2019 job easy:\u00a0The White House has put up guardrails around Biden, they say, and\u00a0he does not engage in as many interviews or planned press conferences\u00a0as previous presidents. At those events,\u00a0the press might be able to gauge how he\u2019s doing on the spot, without prepared remarks. \u201cThey keep him at arm\u2019s length, and he rarely does extended interviews,\u201d the reporter said of the White House,\u00a0although he acknowledged Biden has started giving more interviews as of late. Biden has done fewer interviews and formal press conferences than his most recent predecessors, according to data compiled by\u00a0Martha Joynt Kumar,\u00a0professor emerita of political science at Towson University who chronicles the presidents\u2019 interactions with the press. But on quick and informal interactions with the press, like shouted questions on the way to his helicopter or plane, Biden\u00a0as of this week has had 588 interactions, Kumar reports, second only to Trump when compared to recent presidents. But those interactions are not the same as an extended press conference, reporters noted. On Tuesday, ABC News announced Biden would sit down with George Stephanopoulos for an interview, his first since the debate. The White House press shop has also been very \u201caggressive\u201d and \u201cfairly successful\u201d in mitigating coverage of concerns over the president\u2019s age,\u00a0said\u00a0another White House reporter who works for a different publication. \u201c[B]erating reporters who bring them reporting about age concerns, bemoaning that it\u2019s all anyone writes about (clearly, it\u2019s not) and often attacking pieces after they run,\u201d the reporter told CNN. \u201cI think that\u2019s left some folks to conclude that these stories are too painful to report or that they should pick their spots more. It\u2019s clear the age stories that have angered the White House (and the liberal Twittersphere) the most.\u201d Alex Thompson, a White House reporter for Axios, said on CNN the day after the debate that \u201cthe White House\u2019s response every single time\u00a0it\u00a0has come up for three-and-a-half years has been to deflect, to gaslight, to not tell the truth \u2013 not just to reporters, not just to other Democrats, but even at times to themselves about the president\u2019s limitations at his age.\u201d Still, this White House\u2019s recent conduct with reporters pales in comparison to Trump\u2019s team, which has done everything from revoking press access to reporters they disagree with, to calling reporters the \u201cenemy of the people.\u201d The White House declined to comment. Aging doesn\u2019t happen all at once Aging is also not a sudden moment.\u00a0That makes it trickier to report on. \u201cTo some extent, the decline has appeared to be gradual \u2014 hard to notice from day to day \u2014 and that\u2019s perhaps made it harder for reporters to determine when is the right moment to write something,\u201d one of the reporters said. Just a few days before the debate, Biden held a press conference at the G7 alongside Ukrainian President Vlodomyr Zelensky that passed off without anything of note in Biden\u2019s demeanor. But reporters pointed out (and have published stories noting) that the president has been using teleprompters at most big events, even fundraisers where in the past he might not have. He has also started to use the lower stairs to board Air Force One. Last year, The New York Times published a lengthy piece on the \u201ccomplicated reality of America\u2019s oldest president,\u201d which looked at some of those accommodations and concerns for his age, but also the moments where he showed stamina and vigor. Some reporters said that there has been a distinct change\u00a0within the last year, and that the press corps should have reported more aggressively on the accommodations made for the president. \u201cI think the press, most of the White House press, did suffer from a bit of lack of curiosity,\u201d one of the reporters said. Look who you\u2019re up against Biden\u2019s allies will often question coverage of the president\u2019s age, questioning why reporters focus on the president\u2019s age and mental lucidity and not on Trump\u2019s\u00a0\u2013\u00a0who, at 78,\u00a0was observed falling asleep during his hush money trial, has made his own major verbal flubs and bizarre statements, and regularly spouts complete falsehoods. \u201cIt makes sense to reflect on this now and ask whether we missed or, really, under-reported the story of Biden\u2019s age and decline. But it\u2019s complicated,\u201d one of the reporters said. \u201cThe fact that the political alternative to Biden is an authoritarian who sparked an insurrection and is a convicted felon does not mean that the press is failing American democracy to focus on Biden\u2019s obvious frailty.\u201d One of the reporters said the media can, and do, report on both. Biden\u2019s allies, however, say too much attention is placed on Biden\u2019s age and not on the threat Trump could pose to American democracy. But the reporters say they can, and should, do both. \u201cJust because you are reporting on Biden age, doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not reporting on Trump\u2019s lies.\u00a0 I find that argument silly, and it seems one design towards like producing a certain outcome in the election, rather than like an honest reporting,\u201d one of the reporters said. The outlets that had received harsh blowback for their previous reports on Biden\u2019s lucidity now feel justified. A source familiar with the staff behind the Wall Street Journal\u2019s report said that when the piece first published, the reporters were approached by people with sympathy asking how they\u2019re doing \u201cas if something terrible had just happened,\u201d the source said. After the debate, the reporters started to get messages saying they were right.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/media/biden-mental-fitness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/13/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_07_08_success_money-problems-dementia", "text": "Financial files in disarray. Late payments and last-warning service-cutoff notices. Multiple daily bank withdrawals. Out-of-character purchases. When a family member who has been fairly responsible with money all their lives becomes careless with their finances, it may be one sign of as-yet-undiagnosed dementia. Researchers at the New York Federal Reserve who analyzed both US credit reporting and Medicare data found that in the five years before a dementia diagnosis, a person\u2019s average credit scores may start to weaken and their\u00a0payment delinquencies rise. \u201cThe harmful financial effects of undiagnosed memory disorders exacerbate the already substantial financial pressure households face upon diagnosis,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cBeyond susceptibility to payment delinquency, early stage [Alzheimer\u2019s disease and related disorders] may affect new account openings and debt accumulation, credit utilization, and/or credit mix.\u201d Their findings echo the results of a 2020 study from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. \u2018Methodical\u2019 military spouse\u2019s record-keeping deteriorates Marcey Tidwell, who lives in Bloomington, Indiana, said those findings are \u201cnot remotely shocking.\u201d Tidwell\u2019s mother was diagnosed with a form of dementia in 2020 and has been living with her daughter ever since. Tidwell said that for most of her life, her mother was an \u201coutrageously methodical human being\u201d who kept the bills paid and the family records organized across many moves as her husband pursued a career in the military. After going through her mother\u2019s papers this year, Tidwell surmises that her mother\u2019s memory started faltering around 2015, because from that point forward her record-keeping became \u201cless than pristine.\u201d For example, Tidwell said, her mom used to keep an immaculate record of checks written and deposits and withdrawals made in her checkbook register. But that register became a mess. \u201cThere was a bunch of stuff scratched out and she was obsessively adding and re-adding \u2014 she knew things weren\u2019t all they could be. Later on, I saw that she took out large amounts of her savings, more than she needed for groceries.\u201d Former finance executive accrues piles of unpaid bills, finances new car he didn\u2019t need Karen Lemay, who lives in Ottawa, Canada, knew something was really wrong with her father in 2022 when she saw on his desk piles of late-payment notices and final-notification warnings from service providers and insurers. Her father was a former finance executive who \u201cwas very conservative with his money, very smart about it and never reckless with it,\u201d she said. And he had strongly impressed upon his daughter the importance of paying off her credit card in full every month to avoid interest. Yet Lemay discovered he owed $50,000 in charges, interest and late payment fees on a Visa card. He also financed the purchase of a new car he didn\u2019t need, just months before police took away his driver\u2019s license. Normally, he would only buy high-end used cars with cash, she said. What\u2019s more, his daughter noted, he failed to pay his 2021 taxes. So he ended up owing the government roughly $20,000, the bulk of which was for late payment and underpayment penalties. \u201cI spoke to him about some of his balances and he refused to believe he hadn\u2019t paid them,\u201d Lemay said. Two parents with dementia, one daughter\u2019s efforts to reduce financial worry Jayne Sibley, who lives in the United Kingdom, knows the pain and stress of dealing with the financial behaviors that can signal dementia. Her father and mother were both diagnosed with different forms of it. Her father moved into a nursing home years ago, but her now-deceased mother remained in her own home, albeit with live-in care. \u201cThe most challenging thing we faced was managing mum\u2019s everyday money as her condition progressed. She would overspend on things she didn\u2019t need or want. Random items, cleaning equipment, luxury food. She also fell victim to scams over the phone \u2014 a fake insurance policy, those sorts of things,\u201d Sibley said. Her mother also would take money out of the cash machine two to three times a day and give it to anyone who asked. Acutely aware of how high long-term care costs were, given her father\u2019s situation, Sibley said she worried that her mother would run through the money that would be needed for her own care. While her mother\u2019s condition made her vulnerable with money, she initially was still able to walk and shop and go to yoga on her own. In other words, she was able to maintain a lot of her autonomy and social ties. To try to stem the money outflow, Sibley and her brother tried doling out a week\u2019s worth of cash for their mother \u201cbut she\u2019d spend it all in one go,\u201d she said. Ditto when they tried divvying the cash up into daily envelopes. Eventually, they took away her cash card. But, soon after, her condition worsened, Sibley said. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t able to maintain her familiar routines and social connections. That\u2019s when we realized there has to be a better way.\u201d With her husband, she founded Sibstar, which offers a debit card in the UK that can be used by a person with dementia to maintain some sense of financial autonomy and social engagement. When needed, family caregivers can monitor their debit transactions via an app. As a person\u2019s condition worsens, the caregiver can set limits on how much money can be spent on any given day or week, and where the card can be used (eg, at cash machines, online or at the grocery store). Early planning lessens some stress While there are few dementia-specific financial tools to reduce the odds that someone squanders their own hard-earned money, there are steps you can take to make it easier to assume control over another person\u2019s finances when they become incapacitated. In 2008, a year after her father died without a will and a dozen years before her mother was diagnosed with dementia, Tidwell said she and her siblings took their mother to a lawyer to make sure she had a will, named her medical proxy and named the person to whom she would give power of attorney to handle her financial affairs should the need arise. That made it easier for Tidwell, among other things, to get online access in 2018 to her mother\u2019s bank account to make sure nothing was amiss. By 2020, she had automated her mother\u2019s bill paying online. \u201cThe time to make plans is before you need to. It\u2019s hard to overstate what a gift that trip to the lawyer in 2008 was to \u2018future me,\u2019\u201d said Tidwell, who fully manages her mother\u2019s finances now that her condition has worsened considerably. Since dementia can worsen over time and because someone in the initial stages may not recognize they are more vulnerable to financial errors and scams, the US National Institute on Aging recommends that a family take steps early on to alleviate those concerns, such as setting up automated bill payments for the person with dementia. Of course, no amount of advanced financial planning can alleviate the heartbreak of watching a loved one with dementia decline. \u201cI prepared as best as I could, but it\u2019s still hard,\u201d Tidwell said. That\u2019s why she advises anyone potentially facing a similar situation to, in her words, \u201cmake the easy part easy.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/success/money-problems-dementia/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/13/2024", "section": "business"}}

Should Trump\u2019s advantage now turn into a win in November, that would likely mean the preservation or expansion of tax cuts and increased tariffs. During last month\u2019s presidential debates, Trump reiterated his desire to impose a 10% tariff on all imports, which would likely increase inflation and cast doubt on interest rate cuts. \u201cAfter reflecting a statistical dead heat for most of the past few months, US presidential polling has broken decisively in favor of a Republican win, and markets that ignored political rhetoric are beginning to discount outcomes, with bond volatility spiking,\u201d wrote\u00a0 Lisa Shalett, head of the global investment office at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, in a note on Monday. \u201cWhile stocks have continued to grind higher, equity investors will ultimately need to deal with the potential consequences of proposed policies featuring three critical variables\u2014tax cuts, tariffs and closed borders,\u201d she said. Morgan Stanley research estimates that an expansion of the 2017 tax cuts would boost deficits sharply, sending the US dollar even higher. There are other reasons the dollar has been propelled higher as some European and Asian currencies have seen lackluster growth. The US economy has been relatively resilient through high inflation and interest rates while the eurozone slipped into recession and China and Japan suffered their own economic setbacks. Why it matters: \u201cThe US dollar has been amazingly strong since the US is expected to lead a worldwide economic recovery,\u201d said Louis Navellier, chairman and founder of Navellier & Associates. But that comes with potential repercussions. \u201cA strong US dollar can hinder multi-international companies like the big stocks that dominate the S&P 500, however, smaller, more domestic companies are poised to prosper.\u201d While expectations for second-quarter earnings, which begin in earnest on Friday, remain high, there may be some pessimism on calls about what a strong dollar could mean going forward, he said. A strong dollar makes US exports more expensive and reduces the profits of American companies operating overseas when earnings are converted back to dollars. It also increases competition from cheaper imports. And while a strong dollar lowers the cost of imported raw materials, it can boost inflation and hurt foreign investments.

Boeing agrees to plead guilty Boeing has agreed to plead guilty to one charge of conspiracy to defraud the United States\u00a0for its role in two fatal 737 Max crashes,\u00a0the Justice Department said in a court filing Sunday evening. It represents yet another black eye for the company after a series of embarrassing safety blunders, but the agreement avoids what could have been more serious consequences, reports CNN\u2019s Chris Isidore. It will pay up to $487 million in fines \u2014 a fraction of the $24.8 billion that families of crash victims wanted the aircraft maker to pay. The families of victims of\u00a0two fatal crashes\u00a0of the 737 Max oppose the deal, the department said. The guilty plea is a severe blow to the reputation of Boeing, a company once known for the quality and safety of its commercial planes. Beyond the fatal crashes of the 737 Max jets, the company has faced a series of questions about the safety and quality of its planes.\u00a0In January,\u00a0a door plug on a 737 Max flown by Alaska Airlines\u00a0blew out early in a flight, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the jet and further damaging Boeing\u2019s reputation. The agreement stipulates that Boeing will have to operate under the oversight of an independent monitor \u2013 a person to be chosen by the government \u2013 for a period of three years.

{"id": "2024_07_09_homes_mississippi-west-virginia-home-ownership-rates", "text": "When Vera Sansalone, a realtor in West Virginia showed a log cabin home on a 90-acre property in Mannington to an interested buyer from the Boston area, he was shocked by the $420,000 asking price. After deciding not to buy it, Sansalone said the Boston buyer left her with one piece of advice: \u201cHe said I should mark that property up by about $300,000,\u201d she said. The relatively low listing price for a home on nearly 4 million square feet of property, while surprising to a Boston native used to sharply higher real estate prices (some studio apartments in Boston are sold for more money), may not come as a shock to residents of West Virginia. \u201cHere in West Virginia, you can get 90 acres for under half a million dollars,\u201d Sansalone told CNN. Owning a home is often touted as core to the American dream \u2013 but the ease with which a person is able to buy one is highly correlated to the wealth of the state where they live. When comparing personal wealth data with homeownership, a curious pattern emerges: Many states with high homeownership rates have lower income levels and vice versa. Demographics, competition for homes and strict zoning regulations all play a role in the cost of real estate. According to Federal Reserve data, West Virginia\u2019s average personal income of $52,585 per capita is the second-lowest in the US. However, despite its relatively low personal income levels, it has the highest homeownership rate of all 50 states, at 77%, according to US census data. Mississippi\u2014the only state with a lower average personal income than West Virginia\u2014has the third-highest homeownership rate in the country. Although there are some outliers, the trend is apparent: Cities tip the scales when it comes to homeownership Mike Simonsen, founder of real estate analytics firm Altos Research, recently pointed out the inverse relationship between wealth and homeownership on social media. He told CNN that the relationship surprised him. \u201cI would have expected that the more wealthy a place is, the more likely that its people can afford a home,\u201d he said. \u201cIt turns out the opposite is true.\u201d New York, California and Massachusetts have some of the highest levels of personal income yet count themselves among the states with the lowest homeownership rates. One of the main reasons for this low homeownership, according to Simonsen and others, is that those states all contain major cities, which attract a younger, more mobile population and offer more rental and multi-family living options compared to rural areas. \u201cBig cities attract people who are in transition or the growth stage of their lives. They\u2019re more interested in renting, or they may be more transient,\u201d Simonsen said. Many of these cities, such as New York City and San Francisco, also attract buyers from across the US and internationally, bidding up the price of homes. According to the Federal Reserve, the median sales price of houses sold in the US was $420,800 as of the first quarter. A scroll through Zillow listings shows many three- and four-bedroom homes for sale in West Virginia under $200,000.  But the average value of a home in Manhattan\u00a0is $1,102,025 and $1,299,639 in San Francisco, according to Zillow.  There\u2019s another reason that big cities skew the data. Laurie Goodman, the founder of the Housing Policy Center at the Urban Institute, said large cities and their surrounding suburbs also have strict zoning laws that dictate how land may be used. \u201cZoning makes land much more expensive because you\u2019re restricting the use of it,\u201d Goodman said. She added that land is very scarce in large cities, driving up the cost of buying a home even further. A growing number of local and state governments, led by both Democrats and Republicans, have begun to rethink zoning laws in response to the nationwide housing shortage. Some local governments have even begun loosening laws to convert vacated office spaces into affordable housing. The number of apartments in US cities scheduled to be converted from old office spaces has more than quadrupled in the last four years, from 12,100 in 2020 to 55,300 in 2024, according to a recent report from RentCafe, a real estate research company. The trend is most prominent in Washington DC, New York and Dallas, the report said. Governments are getting creative in their attempts to create new housing in other ways: In September, New York City Mayor Eric Adams announced an effort to eliminate mandates that parking spaces be included with new construction, freeing up space to build more homes. \u201cFor more than 60 years, we have added layers upon layers of regulations, effectively outlawing the kinds of housing that our city has long relied on,\u201d Adams said in a statement at the time. Homes are getting more expensive, no matter the state Despite the relatively high homeownership rates in some states, the US is experiencing a historically difficult home affordability crisis. Home prices have jumped 47% since early 2020, growing faster than household income, according to a June report from Harvard University\u2019s Joint Center for Housing Studies. Stephanie Moulton, a professor of housing and urban economics at Ohio State University, said that differences in homeownership by state don\u2019t diminish the fact that it\u2019s becoming less affordable to own a home in most areas of the country. \u201cWe know that owning a home is, for better or worse, the primary mode by which people build wealth in our country,\u201d Moulton said. Elevated mortgage rates have also helped fuel one of the most costly housing markets in decades. Even West Virginia, which counts three out of every four housing units in the state as owner-occupied, isn\u2019t insulated, Sansalone said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a change in our markets,\u201d she said. \u201cHome prices are going up here, just as they are across the country. It is a bit more difficult for buyers right now.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/homes/mississippi-west-virginia-home-ownership-rates/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/13/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_11_business_tractor-supply-dei-climate-lgbtq", "text": "As recently as February, Tractor Supply Co., known for selling animal feed, pet food and lawn and garden equipment to hobby farmers, told investors that climate change was a significant threat to its business. Any delay or failure to meet its goals of cutting emissions 50% in six years and achieving net zero emissions by 2040 could hurt \u201cpublic perception of our business, employee morale, customer or stockholder support\u201d and its financial performance, the company said in its annual report. Tractor Supply also warned that it could suffer similar business consequences if it did not meet its five-year diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) plan to increase spending by 35% with diverse suppliers and boost representation of people of color at manager levels and above at the company by 50%. Hal Lawton, the chief executive of the Brentwood, Tennessee-based company, had said these initiatives \u201cmake great business sense for Tractor Supply.\u201d But Tractor Supply has decided that all of those risks are now worth ignoring. The company announced last month that it will withdraw its carbon emission reduction goals and eliminate jobs and goals focused on diversity, equity and inclusion. It will also stop sponsoring LGBTQ+ Pride festivals and voting campaigns, as well as submitting data to the Human Rights Campaign, one of the biggest LGBTQ+ non-profit advocacy groups in the United States. By walking away from diversity and climate goals, Tractor Supply has become the latest corporate giant to retreat from progressive initiatives it once promoted, joining Bud Light, Target and others. Although the company\u2019s changes have placated some customers, they have hurt its reputation with other customers and employees and could bring on the type of risks the brand recently warned about. Tractor Supply is \u201ctrying to thread the needle,\u201d said Nooshin Warren, a professor of marketing at the University of Arizona who studies corporate activism and corporate political culture. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to keep both sides happy, which usually never happens.\u201d Tractor Supply, she noted, has become a more diverse company in recent years, and the company\u2019s decision could alienate employees. Racial and ethnic minorities make up 18% of its approximately 50,000 employees and 33% of its board of directors, and it has earned strong ratings from the Human Rights Campaign for LGBTQ+ inclusive policies. Tractor Supply\u2019s reversal came after Robby Starbuck, who in 2022 launched a failed bid for Tennessee\u2019s 5th Congressional District and now hosts a podcast, waged a weeks-long campaign on X calling on customers to boycott Tractor Supply and contact its corporate leadership over the company\u2019s LGBTQ+ and DEI hiring initiatives. \u201cIt\u2019s time to expose Tractor Supply,\u201d he first posted June 6, drawing attention to corporate components like \u201cLGBTQIA+ events at work\u201d and \u201ca DEI council.\u201d Other conservative political candidates, activists and customers began criticizing the company on social media, and said they would stop shopping at the chain. \u201cWe have heard from customers that we have disappointed them,\u201d Tractor Supply said. \u201cWe have taken this feedback to heart.\u201d \u201cGoing forward,\u201d Tractor Supply said, \u201cwe will ensure our activities and giving tie directly to our business.\u201d The company said that although it\u2019s ending DEI goals and carbon emissions goals, it will still ensure a \u201crespectful environment\u201d and focus on land and water conservation efforts. But Tractor Supply\u2019s reversal has already caused outcry. The National Black Farmers Association, a non-profit advocacy group representing 130,000 Black farmers and their families, has called for Lawton\u2019s resignation and said the company has \u201clittle respect for (Black) farmers.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re sending the wrong signal to America at the wrong time in history,\u201d John Boyd, the president of the organization, told CNN. \u201cAmerica isn\u2019t just white men. It\u2019s made up a lot of different people. They have a lot of people they\u2019re offending.\u201d Boyd, a fourth-generation farmer who is a Tractor Supply shareholder and customer and buys feed, mineral blocks and fencing frequently from the chain, said many Black farmers rely on Tractor Supply for their suppliers. He feels the company \u201ccaved to hard right-wing nonsense\u201d and plans to stop shopping at the chain. A Tractor Supply store manager in upstate New York who is gay resigned and told the town newspaper that the company \u201cbetrayed\u201d employees and customers. Tractor Supply declined to comment on these statements. Tractor Supply\u2019s customer base Tractor Supply has a broad customer base. The company has more than 2,400 stores in 49 states and targets recreational farmers, ranchers, animal and pet owners who primarily live in towns outside major metropolitan areas and in rural communities. Rural areas tend to be more politically conservative than urban areas. In 2020, Republican candidate Donald Trump won 65% of rural voters, according to Pew. But suburban areas are more politically divided \u2014 in 2020, Democratic candidate Joe Biden won 54% of suburban voters. Tractor Supply\u2019s customer base has historically been primarily older men, who lean Republican, but Tractor Supply has increasingly tried to draw Millennials and women, who tend to favor Democrats. Since the pandemic, the company has gained ground with younger consumers who moved out of cities. \u201cCustomer demographic trends continue to trend younger and more female than pre-pandemic,\u201d Lawton said last year. Tractor Supply\u2019s reversal could hurt it with these customers, who could be crucial as the company\u2019s historic base ages out of the market. \u201cTractor Supply Co. is turning its back on their own neighbors with this shortsighted decision,\u201d Eric Bloem, vice president of Programs and Corporate Advocacy at the Human Rights Campaign, told CNN in a statement Saturday. \u201cLGBTQ+ people live in every zip code in this country, including rural communities. We are shoppers, farmers, veterans and agriculture students.\u201d Squirrelwood Equine Sanctuary, a New York animal sanctuary that says it spends more than $65,000 annually at Tractor Supply, said it plans to stop shopping at the chain. \u201cWe never asked for a pride flag out front. We do expect respect and inclusion. You have lost our business and every shred of respect we might have had,\u201d the non-profit said on X. Corporate America\u2019s retreat Particularly after the May 2020 murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer, companies rolled out policies aimed at diversifying their workforces and welcoming customers from all backgrounds. But Tractor Supply\u2019s reversal is part of a larger corporate retreat on DEI programs and environmental goals. Many of these efforts are now under attack from right-wing activists, businessmen such as Bill Ackman and Elon Musk, and others. The backlash also comes amid a wave of legislation in Republican-led states to curtail LGBTQ rights and cut DEI programs in colleges and universities, alongside lawsuits to stop 401(k) managers from considering climate change and other environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors when selecting investments. Right-wing groups have threatened boycotts against brands like Bud Light, Disney and Nike to roll back their inclusivity efforts. They\u2019ve even gone after Chick-fil-A for its diversity programs and Cracker Barrel for selling plant-based sausages, brands traditionally seen as conservative. Last year, Bud Light\u2019s partnership with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney sparked an anti-trans backlash and a months-long boycott of the beer brand, throughout which the company failed to take a firm stance in support of Mulvaney and the transgender community. The boycott and the subsequent tepid response lost parent company Anheuser-Busch InBev as much as $1.4 billion in sales, as well as its credibility with a major LGBTQ+ non-profit. Last month, retailer Target said it will limit how many stores would carry its Pride-themed collection for adults after a boycott from right-wing activists last summer led to a sharp dip in sales. Many companies are \u201cturning back,\u201d said Nooshin Warren from the University of Arizona. \u201cIt seems that retracting is now the trend.\u201d CNN\u2019s Eva Rothenberg contributed to this article.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/business/tractor-supply-dei-climate-lgbtq/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/13/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_11_tech_apple-pay-europe-mobile-wallets", "text": "Apple has yielded to pressure by European regulators to give rivals access to the contactless payments technology on iPhones, meaning that their users will no longer be limited to the Apple Pay mobile wallet. The development on the tap-to-pay technology underscores mounting regulatory scrutiny of Apple (AAPL) in the European Union, where it is also facing a potential huge fine for allegedly breaching the bloc\u2019s landmark Digital Markets Act. The European Commission, the EU\u2019s executive arm, announced this and other changes to Apple\u2019s business practices Thursday, saying they would open up competition in mobile payments on iPhones. \u201ciPhone users will (now) be able to use their preferred mobile wallet for payments in stores\u2026 while enjoying all the iPhone functionalities, including double click, tap-and-go and Face ID,\u201d the EU\u2019s competition chief Margrethe Vestager told journalists. The tech giant has until July 25 to implement the changes, which will remain in force for 10 years and apply throughout the 30 countries in the European Economic Area. Under the agreement, third-party mobile wallet developers will gain free access to the standard technology used for contactless payments with iPhones, known as near-field communication (NFC) technology. Apple will also allow iPhone users to choose which mobile wallet to make the default wallet on their phones. \u201cApple is providing developers in the European Economic Area with an option to enable NFC contactless payments and\u00a0contactless\u00a0transactions for car keys, closed loop transit, corporate badges, home keys, hotel keys, merchant loyalty/rewards, and event tickets\u00a0from within their iOS apps,\u201d Apple said in a statement shared with CNN. \u201cApple Pay and Apple Wallet will continue to be available in the European Economic Area for users and developers.\u201d The European Commission first raised objections against Apple\u2019s tap-to-pay practices in 2022, having opened a formal antitrust investigation into Apple Pay two years earlier. The regulators found that Apple had abused its dominant market position by restricting access to the NFC technology needed to make payments on mobile devices. That means rivals wanting to create apps or wallets using the tap-to-pay features on iPhones have been unable to do so and users have been forced to use Apple Pay for mobile payments. \u201cFrom now on, Apple can no longer use its control of the iPhone ecosystem to keep (competing) mobile wallets out of the market,\u201d Vestager said. \u201cCompeting wallet developers as well as consumers will benefit from these changes, opening up innovation and choice while keeping payments secure.\u201d The commitments do not extend to Apple Watches, however. \u201cOur impression was that the number of people who use Apple Watches for payments is rather small,\u201d said Vestager, adding that there was \u201climited harm done\u201d from excluding those devices.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/tech/apple-pay-europe-mobile-wallets/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/13/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_success_saving-under-high-interest-rates", "text": "Editor\u2019s Note: This is an updated version of an article that originally ran on May 1. As was widely expected, the Federal Reserve left its benchmark interest rate unchanged for its seventh meeting in a row on Wednesday. People carrying variable-rate debt like credit cards and those seeking a loan won\u2019t be happy given that the Fed\u2019s rate, which directly and indirectly affects consumers\u2019 borrowing costs, remains at a 23-year high. Those rates will likely stay high for a while. At this point, only one cut is seen as likely before the end of the year, according to US central bankers\u2019 latest summary of economic projections. But whenever the cuts start, they may be small. \u201cAbsent a complete about-face from the economy, interest rates aren\u2019t likely to come down soon enough, or fast enough, to provide meaningful relief to borrowers. Utilize zero-percent credit card balance transfer offers, shop around for lower fixed-rate personal loans and home equity loans, and channel as much income as possible toward paying down this debt as quickly as possible,\u201d said Greg McBride, Bankrate.com\u2019s chief financial analyst. But the Fed\u2019s decision leaves savers, once again, in the catbird seat when it comes to making money on their money. \u201cSavers are enjoying the best returns on savings accounts and CDs in more than 15 years, with the most competitive offers outpacing inflation. In addition, these conditions are poised to persist for the foreseeable future,\u201d McBride said. Online high-yield savings accounts The best bang for your savings can still be had in online high-yield savings accounts at FDIC-insured banks, which yield way more than today\u2019s 0.58% overall average savings rate. As of June 11, the average online savings account rate was 4.40%, according to DepositAccounts.com. And many online high-yield accounts continue to offer rates of 5% or more. Say you have $10,000 in savings. If you leave it parked in a regular savings account at 0.5%, you\u2019ll get $50 in interest for a year. If you put it instead in a 5% high-yield account, you\u2019ll get $500. A high-yield savings account is the best place to park money you\u2019ll need to cover emergencies as well as anticipated large expenses that you have to pay in the next three months to a year. As with any savings account, banks can lower the rate they offer \u2014 also known as the APY \u2014 at any time. And you can be sure they will do just that when the Fed looks like it will finally start cutting rates, McBride said. But, he added, since rates are likely to be cut in small increments, online high-yield savings accounts may continue to offer inflation-beating returns for some time. \u201cThey will still offer the best way to preserve your [money\u2019s] buying power,\u201d McBride said. Money market accounts and money market funds Money market deposit accounts and money market mutual funds are generating yields competitive with the best high-yield savings accounts. But there are important differences. Money market deposit accounts are bank products. So, assuming your bank is FDIC insured, your account is too. (Or, if your account is at a federally backed credit union, your money will be\u00a0insured by the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund.) As with high-yield accounts, you may get the best deals at an online bank. But money market accounts may have a higher minimum deposit requirement than a high-yield account. Money market funds, by contrast, are an investment product \u2014 they generate return by investing in short-term, low-risk debt instruments and are currently yielding an average of 5.12%, according to the Crane 100 Money Fund Index. Such funds are a good place to park cash you have in your brokerage account that you may want to use at some point to buy equities or bonds, McBride said. Money market funds are not FDIC-insured, but any brokerage you use should be insured by the\u00a0Securities Investor Protection Corporation, which\u00a0covers your funds up to a limit if your brokerage ever goes under. Certificates of deposit CDs are still a great place to park any money you can leave untouched for a fixed\u00a0period of time \u2014 anywhere from a few months to five years or longer. As of June 11, the average rate was 4.971% on an online one-year CD, and 3.815% on a five-year CD, according to DepositAccounts.com. While your brick-and-mortar bank may offer a CD at a good rate, you may get a better one shopping around. The easiest way to do that without having to set up an additional account at another bank is to shop for CDs through your online brokerage, which is likely to offer a wide array of CDs from many different banks. At Schwab.com, for instance, CDs on offer ranging in duration from three months all the way up to 10 years offered average annual returns over 5%, with most ranging between 5.30% and 5.45%. The highest annual average was 5.56% for a three-month CD. If you have to withdraw money before the end of a CD\u2019s term, you can always get all of your principal back but may forfeit some of the interest earned as an early withdrawal penalty. Treasury bills and notes Beyond deposit accounts, investing in short-term Treasury bills and intermediate-term Treasury notes has been another way to earn a competitive return with virtually no risk since Treasuries are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. Treasury bills come in six different maturities: 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 13 weeks, 17 weeks, 26 weeks and 52 weeks. Treasury notes mature in two, three, five, seven or 10 years. \u201cAs long as the Fed holds its rate in the 5.25% to 5.5% range, we expect most Treasury bill yields to hover around 5.25% as well,\u201d said Collin Martin, fixed income strategist at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. But, Martin added, \u201cWhile the timing of rate cuts has been pushed back, we still expect them to arrive later this year, and investors in short-term investments would likely face reinvestment risk.\u201d That\u2019s why he suggests investors consider buying some intermediate-term investments now before rates are cut if they want to lock in a higher yield for some of their money, such as Treasury notes maturing in the next four to 10 years. On Wednesday, yields on Treasury bills were north of 5% and yields on Treasury notes were north of 4%, according to Schwab.com. When deciding whether it makes sense to invest in a CD or a Treasury for the same duration, you might opt for the Treasury if you live in a high-tax state, McBride suggested, since interest on Treasuries is\u00a0exempt from state and local taxes. In all instances, the easiest way to purchase Treasuries and other bonds is to do so through your brokerage account.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/success/saving-under-high-interest-rates/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/13/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl", "text": "Sam Altman has agreed to return to lead OpenAI, the company said in a Tuesday post on X, just days after his surprise ouster as chief executive sparked an employee revolt that threatened to undermine what has been the leading company in the fledgling artificial intelligence industry. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman wrote that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft, which is the ChatGPT maker\u2019s biggest financial backer. The announcement appears to bring to an end days of chaos for the AI industry that included negotiations over who should lead OpenAI and how the firm should be run, as well as broader discussions about just how fast the arms race to develop AI technology should be moving. The details of Altman\u2019s firing and re-hiring remain murky. In its announcement Friday, OpenAI claimed that Altman had been insufficiently \u201ccandid\u201d with the board. That ambiguous language sent the rumor mill flying. But a key factor in Altman\u2019s ouster was the presence of\u00a0tensions between Altman, who favored pushing AI development more aggressively, and members of the original OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the crisis. As of Monday morning, Nadella had announced that Altman, along with fellow OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, would be joining Microsoft to lead a new AI research division. OpenAI said it had hired former Twitch chief Emmett Shear as interim CEO. But then hundreds of OpenAI employees, nearly the company\u2019s entire staff, threatened to leave, potentially for Microsoft, if the company\u2019s board didn\u2019t resign and reinstate Altman as CEO. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it invested billions in to help bolster its ambitions in developing AI, which many in Silicon Valley think will be the most important wave of technological advancement in the coming decades. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Microsoft CEO\u00a0Satya Nadella said on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d Altman\u2019s vision to quickly roll out and commercialize AI tools also appears to have won out. Publicly, Altman has long cautioned about risks posed by AI, and he\u202fhas pledged to lawmakers and customers that he would move OpenAI forward responsibly. \u201cIs [AI] gonna be like the printing press that diffused knowledge, power and learning widely across the landscape that empowered ordinary, everyday individuals that led to greater flourishing, that led above all to greater liberty?\u201d he said in a May Senate subcommittee hearing pressing for regulation. \u201cOr is it gonna be more like the atom bomb \u2014 huge technological breakthrough, but the consequences (severe, terrible) continue to haunt us to this day?\u201d But inside the company, Altman had been pushing to bring products to market more quickly and to sell them for a profit. Altman announced a few weeks ago at OpenAI\u2019s first-ever developer day that the company would make tools available so anyone could create their own version of ChatGPT. OpenAI has also worked with Microsoft to roll out ChatGPT-like technology across Microsoft\u2019s products. OpenAI and iPhone designer Jony Ive had also reportedly\u202fbeen in talks to raise $1 billion from Japanese conglomerate SoftBank for an AI device to replace the smartphone. \u2014 CNN\u2019s Juliana Liu and Diksha Madhok contributed reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/13/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_17_success_how-to-find-good-affordable-colleges", "text": "Long before you take your high schooler on college campus tours, consider this: Shopping for college shouldn\u2019t be any different than shopping for a home.\u00a0When you want to buy a home, you come up with a range of how much you can afford and get pre-qualified for a mortgage. Then you look in neighborhoods that offer homes that meet your family\u2019s needs and fall within your price range. \u201cAdopt a mindset that we\u2019re buying college like we\u2019re buying a house,\u201d said Beth Walker, author of \u201cBuying College Better\u201d and \u201cNever Pay Retail for College.\u201d As a financial adviser and certified\u00a0college planning specialist, Walker tries to help families avoid a situation that many find themselves in at the 11th hour: Their child applies \u2014 and gets into \u2014 schools they cannot afford because the schools won\u2019t give them enough aid. And then they just \u2026 try to make it work, no matter how much debt is involved for the parents or the student. Instead, she advises families to start as early as 9th or 10th grade in figuring out what is affordable for them as a family \u2014 so parents don\u2019t sacrifice their own financial welfare and the future college student doesn\u2019t drown in debt upon graduation. And second, she recommends assessing how a child\u2019s talents and interests pare with majors and careers they might want to pursue. Doing both those things can help you target the right colleges to apply to. Mike McKinnon, executive director of the National Institute of Certified College Planners, defines the perfect college as one \u201cwhere a student can go be happy, safe and successful, graduate in four years or less with a marketable degree and little or no debt.\u201d In helping families align parents\u2019 affordability constraints with their student\u2019s academic and social needs, he cautions them not to automatically assume the Ivys or other high-prestige schools will be best simply because of their status. And he stresses what success in life looks like after college and notes that an Ivy League degree isn\u2019t the only path to achieving it, especially if your child won\u2019t get much aid to attend. In fact, said Todd Fothergill, founder and CEO of Strategies for College, a lot of brand-name schools don\u2019t even offer merit-based aid, only need-based. So if you\u2019re not rich, but you make too much to qualify for need-based aid, you could find yourself having to cover the entire cost of tuition, room and board every year, which is pushing $90,000 at some US colleges. Set up financial guardrails well before the college search Fothergill created a free calculator called CostHero that lets parents assess what financial resources they will have available to pay for a child\u2019s college education. It then provides a range of affordability: At the low end is the number representing what they can pay if they don\u2019t take on debt. And at the high end is the number they can pay if they also take out an unsubsidized federal Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students (PLUS). \u201cIf you\u2019re not in a position to write a check for $90,000 a year, put up guardrails for yourself so you don\u2019t blow up your retirement,\u201d he said. The calculator inputs let you set the amount of resources you\u2019re willing to use to pay for college from your income and savings, your child\u2019s earnings from summer jobs, any family gifts, and any federal Stafford loans your child may take. It also factors in if you qualify for the federal American Opportunity Tax Credit. That credit, for qualified educational expenses, will reduce your tax bill or increase any refund you have coming. The calculator also gives you a debt-to-income score like the kind a mortgage lender might use to assess whether you\u2019re a good credit risk. Ideally, he said, you don\u2019t want your housing costs to exceed 36% of your gross income and your total debt \u2014 including debt from housing, cars, credit cards and any parental education loans \u2014 to exceed 43%. If your DTI ratio is close to or higher than 43% that is a sign you could get yourself into trouble if you end up having any financial problems while your child is in college, Fothergill said. \u201cIf folks have a way to determine the range of affordability prior to the onset of the college search, the outcomes are a lot better.\u00a0 For example, if one knows that the range of affordability is between $30,000 [a year] with no parent debt and $50,000 with parent debt, then any college that comes in with a net cost in that range is, by definition, affordable,\u201d Fothergill said. Net cost refers to the true cost of attendance after figuring out how much aid your child may get (e.g., grants and scholarships). Figure out where your student may qualify for the most aid Generally speaking, the biggest tuition discounts go to the most academically accomplished students in an incoming class. \u201cThe student needs to be in the top 25% of those admitted,\u201d Walker said. Getting into that top 25% cohort is based on SAT or ACT scores, and having a high, unweighted GPA based on a rigorous high school curriculum. The curriculum\u2019s academic rigor can be further bolstered by taking AP courses. Since your child is more likely to make the top quartile at some schools than others, Fothergill and Walker both recommend your child focus on applying only to those schools in which they stand the best chances of being in that top group to maximize their chances for merit-based aid. Otherwise, you\u2018ll spend money to apply to guidance-counselor-recommended \u201csafety\u201d schools or \u201creach\u201d schools with no sense if those places are affordable to you should your child get in. Using reported data from admissions officers about their key criteria in admitting an incoming class and based on what more than 1,000 schools report about the qualifications they used to grant aid, Fothergill created another tool called ListHero. It gives students a score that helps gauge\u00a0how competitive their profile is\u00a0at a given school, relative to others admitted, and by extension their eligibility for tuition discounts. Right now the tool is only available to college planning professionals for a fee. But Fothergill plans to create a free mini-version for consumers to use. For parents doing their own research on test scores, GPA requirements, costs and aid, he recommends checking the Department of Education College Scorecard, the site CollegeData.com and the College Board. Other ways to reduce college costs before applying While your children are in high school they can take other steps to reduce the total cost of their education. One way is by doing well on the PSAT to qualify to compete for a National Merit Scholarship. Another is to take AP courses. If their high school doesn\u2019t offer them, there is a program called Freshman Year for Free offered by the Modern States Education Alliance. It provides free AP placement courses and pays the fee for students to take the AP tests or college-level preparation (CLEP) tests administered through the College Board. Getting the minimum AP scores a college requires to earn a college credit will lower how much you ultimately have to spend on tuition. A third option is to see if your state has a program that offers a year of free in-state community college, the credits from which can be transferred to a state university from which your child could earn their degree. Or, if you plan to go to any other college, make sure the school will accept the credits from a community college course you plan to take. No matter what steps you take, starting the research and budgeting process early can save everyone a lot of stress, debt and potential heartache in the end. Said Walker: \u201cWe have to be a lot more intentional about this purchase.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/success/how-to-find-good-affordable-colleges/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/13/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_07_11_business_uaw-biden-fain", "text": "United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain and other members of the union\u2019s board have expressed concerns about President Joe Biden\u2019s ability to beat Donald Trump in November, a source close to the union says. The union is discussing the way forward on how to beat Trump in November, but the group is not considering rescinding its endorsement of Biden at this time, the source added. The doubts come as Biden is facing growing worries about his ability to beat his predecessor in the presidential election, after a disastrous performance at last month\u2019s CNN presidential debate raised fresh questions about his age and his mental acuity. Reuters was first to report Fain\u2019s concerns. When a reporter at a Thursday press conference raised the UAW\u2019s concerns, the president responded, \u201cThe UAW just endorsed me.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a long way to go this campaign,\u201d the president later added. \u201cI\u2019m just gonna keep moving.\u201d Biden now is working to shore up support within the labor community.\u00a0The president spent about 30 minutes at the AFL-CIO headquarters in Washington, DC, on Wednesday, describing the group of union leaders as his \u201cdomestic NATO.\u201d After Biden\u2019s drop-by, the group met privately for some time, including hearing from campaign officials. Fain, a vocal Trump critic, is a member of the AFL-CIO\u2019s executive council, which on Wednesday announced it \u201cunanimously\u00a0voted\u00a0to reaffirm its commitment to re-electing President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the leadership of the most pro-union administration in our lifetimes.\u201d The UAW formally endorsed Biden in January after months of White House overtures to the union chief. The endorsement was seen as a major boon for Biden as he looked to court working class voters in swing states like Michigan and Wisconsin. The president is set to visit Michigan on Friday as he pushes forward with his campaign in the face of deep reservations within his party over his ability to win in November. A union spokesperson declined to comment on the Reuters report. A growing list of prominent Democrats, including sitting senators and members of Congress as well as actor and fundraiser George Clooney, have called for Biden to step aside for a new party nominee for November. In a statement Wednesday, the day Biden visited the group, the AFL-CIO executive council said in a statement: \u201cThe labor movement understands, as Joe Biden does, that solidarity is how we win. The message from today\u2019s meeting couldn\u2019t have been clearer: Right now, it\u2019s time to come together around a vision of a country where everyone has a fair shot with a living wage, affordable health care, retirement security, and time to do the things we love like spending time with family and friends and pursuing our interests and passions.\u201d AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler sought to show a united front after the president\u2019s drop-by, posting a photo on X and writing \u201cHe believes in unions \u2013 and we believe in him.\u201d Biden arrived at the AFL-CIO headquarters shortly after actor George Clooney called for the president to step aside in the 2024 race in a New York Times op-ed. While meeting with the new British Prime Minister Keir Starmer in the Oval Office hours later, the president was peppered with questions from reporters about Clooney\u2019s statement, to which he raised his arms and replied \u201cAFL-CIO! Go, go go!\u201d The president has won the backing of most of the country\u2019s largest union groups at a time when Trump has also sought to make inroads with rank-and-file members. \u201cI said I was going to be the most pro union president in American history, well guess what I am,\u201d Biden said Wednesday. \u201cAnd I\u2019m staying there.\u201d CNN\u2019s Chris Isidore contributed reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/business/uaw-biden-fain/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/13/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "press-corps-biden-news-conference", "text": "For nearly an hour Thursday evening,\u00a0President Joe Biden\u00a0went toe-to-toe with the press corps \u2014 and, perhaps against the wishes of some in his own party, managed to exit the high stakes showdown mostly unscathed. Fielding a barrage of tough questions, Biden addressed 11 outlets during his closely watched dance with the news media, reiterating\u00a0again\u00a0and\u00a0again\u00a0that he plans to stay in the 2024 race, while also displaying an impressive command of complex foreign policy matters. Stylistically, Biden wasn\u2019t without flaws. After introducing\u00a0Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky\u00a0as\u00a0Vladimir Putin\u00a0earlier in the day, Biden accidentally referred to\u00a0Vice President Kamala Harris\u00a0as\u00a0Donald Trump. And throughout the affair, the 81-year-old president mostly spoke in his now trademark low and monotone voice. But, unquestionably, the Biden that showed up at the conclusion of the\u00a0NATO summit was not the same Biden that walked onstage at the\u00a0CNN\u00a0presidential debate two weeks ago. Did he ace Thursday\u2019s test? Probably not. But did he score a passing grade? Most definitely. Interest in Biden\u2019s face-off with the news media had been steadily growing all week as lawmakers and other high-profile figures in the\u00a0Democratic Party\u00a0called for him to step aside and abandon his bid for a second term. Since his disastrous debate with Trump, Biden had not appeared unscripted at a public event for such a lengthy period of time. And, stepping further back, Biden had not held a solo press conference since November, making Thursday\u2019s his first of 2024. The press was eager for an opportunity to confront Biden. As CNN\u2019s\u00a0Hadas Gold\u00a0reported Thursday, journalists who cover the White House were walking into the news conference with a significant amount of pent up frustration. Reporters have felt stonewalled and misled by the White House. They had been earnestly seeking a forum in which they could directly question Biden about his fitness for office and desires to seek an additional four years. The truth is that, despite their pointed questions, reporters extracted little from Biden on Thursday evening. He stayed on message and was able to keep up with the unrelenting stream of queries directed his way. Outside his early flub referring to Harris as Trump, Biden showed a deep understanding of the issues. It was not the senile, dementia-plagued man that has been at times portrayed to the American public. As\u00a0Bill Carter, the veteran media critic, pointed out on\u00a0X, it\u2019s curious why Biden did not actually hold such a press conference in the immediate wake of his poor debate performance to assuage concerns and stop the bleeding sooner. It would have mattered a lot more then. But at this late stage, will it stop naysayers, who have been steadily gaining momentum, from calling on him to withdraw from the race? CNN\u2019s Manu Raju\u00a0reported after the press conference that it is unlikely to. Indeed,\u00a0Rep. Jim Himes, the ranking Democrat on the\u00a0House Intelligence Committee, issued a statement after the news conference saying he believed Biden should drop out of the race. But it could get a lot worse.\u00a0CBS News\u2019 Margaret Brennan\u00a0reported that four Democratic sources told her \u201cthey expect dozens of Democratic lawmakers over the next 48 hours to issue statements\u201d calling on Biden to step aside. And\u00a0CNN\u2019s Edward-Isaac Dovere\u00a0and\u00a0Jeff Zeleny\u00a0reported that\u00a0Barack Obama\u00a0and\u00a0Nancy Pelosi\u00a0have been speaking about their concerns with Biden\u2019s campaign. In other words, at this juncture, while the performance Biden delivered at the much-hyped news conference was strong, it may simply be too late.

Filings show that the company took on about $325 million in debt following its purchase of Redbox in 2022 from private equity giant Apollo Global Management. The plan was to make it into an entertainment conglomerate, combining the DVD rental business with its free streaming services, like Crackle, the entertainment platform once owned by Sony.

{"id": "2024_07_12_economy_us-producer-price-index-inflation-june", "text": "Wholesale price inflation unexpectedly accelerated in June to its highest rate since March 2023, according to new data released Friday. On the surface, the jump in PPI appears to be an unwelcome development for the US economy and the fight to rein in high inflation \u2014 and it appears especially jarring landing one day after the BLS announced that consumer prices fell on a monthly basis for the first time in four years. However, economists caution that monthly data \u2014 and especially the category that drove PPI higher in June \u2014 can be erratic, and that the unexpected jump in PPI isn\u2019t likely a worrisome sign of any broader inflation pressures building in the pipeline. The June increase was attributed to a sharp rise in final demand services, specifically trade services margins, which soared 1.9% from May and offset lower energy prices and still-falling goods production prices. It\u2019s the largest monthly increase for trade services since March 2022. \u201cThe increase was broad-based among wholesalers and retailers of fuel, autos and other goods, but almost certainly is\u00a0not the start of a resurgence in margins,\u201d Ian Shepherdson, chairman and chief economist for Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote in a note to clients on Friday. \u201cThe data are volatile and often revised a lot. Margins will come under increasing\u00a0pressure as growth in consumers\u2019 spending continues to slow.\u201d Economists had expected that prices would increase 0.1% on a monthly basis and hold steady at 2.2% annually. Looking past the volatility and at the \u2018core core\u2019 PPI often is looked to as a potential bellwether for retail-level inflation in the months ahead. Increased margins make the public think of corporate greed and higher costs that are being passed along to consumers by middlemen that are making a profit along the way, said Chris Rupkey, chief economist with FwdBonds. \u201cIt does not sound good, but we don\u2019t think consumers are getting ready to be hit by a new surge in price increases just because margins are going up,\u201d Rupkey wrote in an email reply to a CNN Business query. \u201cThese margins are notoriously difficult to measure, and wholesalers do have their own costs to cover.\u201d When stripping out energy and food-related prices, core PPI jumped 0.4% for the month, rising 3% annually, its highest rate since April 2023. However, to better eliminate the influence of the volatile trade services, economists also look at a \u201ccore core\u201d reading, Andreas Hauskrecht, clinical professor of business economics, at Indiana University\u2019s Kelley School of Business, said in an interview. \u201cSo the \u2018core core\u2019 is without energy, without food and without the trade, because we think this is volatility and pricing that has no direct link with monetary policy, and we try to clean up the data so that we really see a trend,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so I wouldn\u2019t stress too much about the trade index.\u201d In June, the PPI excluding energy, food and trade was flat for the month and on an annual basis slowed to 3.1% from 3.3% in May, BLS data show. Inflation still \u2018dying on the vine\u2019 For US consumers, inflation has been trending in a desired direction during the past couple of months. Despite a brief flare-up of price hikes in the first quarter of the year, which ultimately delayed the Federal Reserve\u2019s plans for interest rate cuts, inflation has cooled considerably during the following three months. On Thursday, the US economy got more good news in the latest Consumer Price Index, the most widely used inflation gauge that measures the average price changes for commonly purchased goods and services. Prices dropped on a monthly basis for the first time since May 2020, and annual inflation slowed to 3%, its slowest rate since June 2023. The June PPI doesn\u2019t reflect a shift in inflation\u2019s slowing trajectory, Rupkey said. \u201cWe think core [Personal Consumption Expenditures] inflation for June is still likely to be either unchanged or the same modest 0.1% increase it was in May,\u201d he said, referencing a closely watched inflation gauge. \u201cInflation still looks to be dying on the vine in large part because commodities and goods price increases have moderated.\u201d The Fed bases its 2% target on the headline PCE index and has increasingly scrutinized the core PCE index for underlying inflationary trends. Energy-heavy transportation and warehousing operations saw prices fall in the early and final purchasing stages of their business, PPI data showed. That indicates that supply-side pressures are easing, Kurt Rankin, senior economist with PNC Financial Services, wrote Thursday. \u201cThe downward-trending energy PPI pace, which lies at the root of all price pressures in the US economy, implies that the second half of 2024 will see diminishing cost pressures from producers\u2019 own energy bills, as well as the cost of shipping goods to retailers,\u201d Rankin wrote.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/12/economy/us-producer-price-index-inflation-june/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/13/2024", "section": "business"}}

It offers 75 exercises, designed to test a range of skills, with videos showing users how to complete them. Performances are automatically scored by artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The data can then be accessed by clubs, allowing their scouts to peruse scores for viable talent, honing their search with a variety of filters; from age and gender to position on the pitch. The app currently has two English Premier League (EPL) partners, Chelsea and Burnley, and clubs can tailor their in-app trials to meet specific needs and set their own benchmarks by having their academy players complete the same drills. \u201cWe\u2019re putting that data up front to make better use of [the scouts\u2019] time,\u201d said Richard Felton-Thomas, chief operating officer of ai.io, the company behind the app. \u201cTo say [to scouts], \u2018Go over to this place today because there\u2019s three players in that game that are all actually beating your Chelsea standard\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s going to be the best use of your time.\u2019\u201d It already appears to be working for some.

He signed a contract\u00a0with EPL team Bournemouth\u00a0in 2021. \u2018It\u2019s more about evolution\u2019 Having beta-tested in with players spanning 125 countries, Greenwood among them, 135 players have been trialed or signed by pro clubs or national teams through the app \u2014 which fully launched in September 2023 \u2014 according to Felton-Thomas. Just over 100,000 players make up the current database, but with over 100 clubs lined up to join Chelsea and Burnley, as well as a multi-year partnership with Major League Soccer in the US announced last May, Felton-Thomas projects user numbers to surge into the millions as the operation ramps up this year. Felton-Thomas said the \u201clion\u2019s share\u201d of its income comes from charging clubs a license fee to run the platform. Annual fees vary depending on the size of the club and the tools they require, ranging from six figures for \u201ctier one\u201d sides like Chelsea, to thousands of pounds for clubs lower down the footballing pyramid. The use of smart technology in sport continues to expand, including\u00a0AI commentary tools and wearable tech for elite athletes. The global market for sports analytics, valued at\u00a0$2.7 billion\u00a0in 2023, is projected to grow 22% by the end of the decade, according to market research firm Grand View Research. Should soccer talent scouts be concerned about being edged out by the arrival of AI in their industry? For Felton-Thomas, new technologies can co-exist with traditional methods. \u201cIt\u2019s more about evolution than revolution,\u201d Felton-Thomas explained. \u201cWe can\u2019t tell you when that player\u2019s actually in that match, how does he deal with adversity? What happens when he\u2019s 2-0 down? What happens when someone\u2019s shouting at him? What happens when he\u2019s just made a massive mistake?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got the ability to just augment real people to do their jobs better and faster, which then gives an opportunity to the player through the AI, but you\u2019re still actually just connecting them to the human on the other side, which is the club and the scout.\u201d While football remains ai.io\u2019s primary focus, the company is looking into opportunities in other sports to launch in the coming years. Further ahead, it may branch out beyond sports. \u201cYou think about the notion that you can be at home and analyze your movements, and how this could spin into health care, physical assessments for military disciplines and emergency services,\u201d Felton-Thomas told CNN.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/01/tech/aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/13/2024", "section": "business"}}

In the lawsuit, filed Sunday in New York state court, the president\u2019s sonaccuses Fox News of unjust enrichment, intentionally inflicting emotional distress, and violating New York civil rights laws. The lawsuit makes good on\u00a0Hunter Biden\u2019s threat he made in April that he would take the network to court if it didn\u2019t immediately issue retractions and corrections. The miniseries, \u201cThe Trial of Hunter Biden,\u201d was a six-part offering on the Fox Nation digital streaming network, and was also promoted on Fox News, the cable TV channel. It featured a dramatized \u201cmock trial\u201d about Hunter Biden\u2019s overseas financial dealings that led in part to his federal tax indictment and that also fueled House Republicans\u2019 struggling impeachment inquiry into his father. Fox News\u00a0took down the miniseries\u00a0in late April, one day after Hunter Biden threatened to file a lawsuit. But according to the lawsuit, promotional materials for the miniseries are still on some Fox News-linked social media pages, and the miniseries episodes are still circulating \u201conline and in the public domain.\u201d A Fox News spokesperson claimed the lawsuit was meritless and \u201centirely politically motivated,\u201d and said the network looks forward to \u201cvindicating our rights in court.\u201d \u201cThe core complaint stems from a 2022 streaming program that Mr. Biden did not complain about until sending a letter in late April 2024,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cThe program was removed within days of the letter, in an abundance of caution, but Hunter Biden is a public figure who has been the subject of multiple investigations and is now a convicted felon. Consistent with the First Amendment, Fox News has accurately covered the newsworthy events of Mr. Biden\u2019s own making.\u201d The new lawsuit claims Fox News \u201ctargeted Mr. (Hunter) Biden in an effort to harass, annoy, alarm, and humiliate him, and tarnish his reputation.\u201d President Joe Biden\u2019s son is seeking an unspecified amount of punitive damages, as well as any profits that Fox reaped from the miniseries, and other corrective measures. \u201cThe miniseries is fictionalized; it is not a news event. It was made for the purpose of trade and advertising, and merely exploits Mr. Biden\u2019s name, image, and likeness for Fox\u2019s commercial benefit,\u201d Hunter Biden\u2019s lawyers wrote in the lawsuit. Hunter Biden\u2019s team said in the lawsuit that without his consent, Fox News \u201cunlawfully published numerous intimate images (both still and video) of Mr. Biden depicting him in the nude, depicting an unclothed or exposed intimate part of him, as well as engaged in sex acts.\u201d The right-wing network said these images originated form Hunter Biden\u2019s\u00a0infamous laptop\u00a0\u2013 data from which was leaked by allies for former President Donald Trump in 2020. The president\u2019s son was\u00a0convicted at a trial\u00a0last month on federal gun charges, and faces a second trial this fall on alleged tax crimes. However, he hasn\u2019t been charged in connection with the bribery and foreign lobbying allegations that were at the center of Fox\u2019s \u201cmock trial\u201d series.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/media/hunter-biden-sues-fox-news/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/13/2024", "section": "business"}}

AT&T said Friday that data was breached from \u201cnearly all\u201d of its cellular customers and the customers of wireless providers that used its network between May 1, 2022, and October 31, 2022. The records of a \u201cvery small number\u201d of customers from January 2, 2023, were also breached, AT&T said. The company\u00a0blamed\u00a0an \u201cillegal download\u201d on a third-party cloud platform that it learned about in April \u2014 just as AT&T was grappling with an\u00a0unrelated major data leak. AT&T listed approximately 110 million wireless subscribers as of the end of 2022.\u00a0Here\u2019s what that means for the millions of Americans that use AT&T\u2019s cellular service. What\u2019s at risk Hackers did not get any names, addresses or Social Security numbers. What they did get is metadata \u2014 call logs that contain a record of every number AT&T customers called or texted (including customers of other wireless networks), the number of times they interacted and the call duration. A cybercriminal could now identify relationships among phone numbers, a useful data point for hackers trying to make their scams more believable. For example, a hacker could see that a customer is in constant contact with a big bank\u2019s line and could send a phishing attempt posing as the bank. The hacker could text the customer saying, \u201cThis is Bank of America. We have some suspicious activity on your account. Click this link to review the charges, or call this number,\u201d said John Dwyer, director of security research at Binary Defense, a cybersecurity solutions firm. Or the hacker could pose as someone the customer has a personal relationship with, like a friend or family member. The age of artificial intelligence makes this even more pressing, according to Collin Walke, cybersecurity and data privacy partner at Hall Estill. \u201cOnce they know who you\u2019ve been communicating with, it allows deep fakes and those sorts of hacks to occur much easier,\u201d Walke said. Some customers\u2019 cell tower ID numbers were also exposed, which could help some bad actors track down geolocations, Walke said. That could also make these hacking attempts more believable. What customers should do Cellphone users should always be careful about phishing and other scam attempts, especially as hackers become more and more sophisticated. But AT&T customers should be hypersensitive to phone calls and text messages where they\u2019re being asked to do things like call a number, click a link or transfer money. That includes requests from what appears to be a number that you normally communicate with, Dwyer said. \u201cIf someone calls or texts you and asks you to do something, make sure you call them back to verify that it\u2019s actually them,\u201d Dwyer said. Of course, without stricter cybersecurity regulation, there isn\u2019t much customers can do to protect against data breaches. That responsibility lies with the federal government and giant telecom companies, which experts say widely go unchecked. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should have an expectation that everyday Americans should be on the front lines of defending themselves for making sure the businesses they interact with have mandatory minimum cybersecurity in place,\u201d Eric Noonan, CEO of cybersecurity provider CyberSheath said.

{"id": "2024_07_03_tech_google-ai-greenhouse-gas-emissions-environmental-impact", "text": "As Google has rushed to incorporate artificial intelligence into its core products \u2014 with sometimes less-than-stellar results \u2014 a problem has been brewing behind the scenes: the systems needed to power its AI tools have vastly increased the company\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. AI systems need lots of computers to make them work. The data centers needed to run them, essentially warehouses full of powerful computing equipment, suck up tons of energy to process data and manage the heat all of those computers produce. The end result has been that Google\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions have soared 48% since 2019, according to the tech giant\u2019s annual environment report. The tech giant blamed that growth mainly on \u201cincreased data center energy consumption and supply chain emissions.\u201d Now, Google is calling its goal to reach net-zero emissions by 2030 \u201cextremely ambitious,\u201d and said the pledge is likely to be affected by \u201cthe uncertainty around the future environmental impact of AI, which is complex and difficult to predict.\u201d In other words: a sustainability push by the company \u2014 which once included the slogan \u201cdon\u2019t be evil\u201d in its code of conduct \u2014 has gotten more complicated thanks to AI. Google, like other tech rivals, has gone all-in on investing in AI, which is widely seen as the next major tech revolution that\u2019s poised to change how we live, work and consume information. The company has integrated its Gemini generative AI technology into some of its core products, including Search and Google Assistant, and CEO Sundar Pichai has called Google an \u201cAI-first company.\u201d But AI comes with a major downside: the power-hungry data centers that Google and other Big Tech rivals are currently spending tens of billions of dollars each quarter to expand in order to fuel their AI ambitions. Illustrating just how much more demanding AI models are than traditional computing systems, the International Energy Agency estimates that a Google search query requires 0.3 watt-hours of electricity on average, while a ChatGPT request typically consumes about 2.9 watt-hours. An October\u00a0study\u00a0from Dutch researcher Alex de Vries estimated that the \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d suggests Google\u2019s AI systems could eventually consume as much electricity as the country of Ireland each year, assuming a full-scale adoption of AI in their current hardware and software. \u201cAs we further integrate AI into our products, reducing emissions may be challenging due to increasing energy demands from the greater intensity of AI compute, and the emissions associated with the expected increases in our technical infrastructure investment,\u201d Google said in its report, published Monday. It added that data center electricity consumption is currently growing faster than it can bring carbon-free electricity sources online. Google said it expects its total greenhouse gas emissions to continue to rise before falling, as the company seeks to invest in clean energy sources, such as wind and geothermal energy, to power its data centers. The large amounts of water used as coolant needed to prevent data centers from overheating also presents a sustainability challenge. Google says it aims to replenish 120% of the freshwater it consumes in its offices and data centers by 2030; last year, it replenished just 18% of that water, although the amount was up sharply from 6% the year prior. Google is also among companies experimenting with ways to use AI to fight climate change. A 2019 Google DeepMind project, for example, trained an AI model on weather forecasts and historical wind turbine data to predict the availability of wind power, helping to increase the value of the renewable energy source for wind farmers. The company has also used AI to suggest more fuel-efficient routes to drivers using Google Maps. \u201cWe know that scaling AI and using it to accelerate climate action is just as crucial as addressing the environmental impact associated with it,\u201d Google said in the report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/tech/google-ai-greenhouse-gas-emissions-environmental-impact/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/13/2024", "section": "business"}}

US consumer prices fell in June\u00a0for the first time since the early months of the pandemic. Fresh data Thursday revealed that consumer prices dropped 0.1% from May. On an annual basis, inflation eased to 3% last month from 3.3% in May. The welcome slowdown in inflation has led investors to move up their bets for when the Federal Reserve could begin cutting interest rates. Wall Street\u2019s expectations for a September rate cut rose to roughly 93% on Thursday from 73% the day before, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. \u201cA September rate cut should be a done deal at this point,\u201d wrote Ron Temple, chief market strategist at Lazard, in a Thursday note. BNP Paribas economists on Thursday updated its base case to reflect a rate cut in September, citing the mix of June inflation and jobs data. They expect two quarter-point cuts in 2024. The Fed has a dual mandate: Keep prices stable and unemployment levels low. The central bank began hiking interest rates in 2022 to tame wayward inflation and has held them steady at the current 23-year high since last July. Thursday\u2019s data, coupled with a cooling but resilient labor market, is an encouraging sign that the Fed will be able to fulfill its dual mandate and begin easing sky-high rates in September. The US economy added 206,000 jobs in June, lower than a downwardly revised tally of 215,000 jobs in May, and the unemployment rate topped 4% for the first time since November 2021. New applications for unemployment benefits have also ticked higher in recent weeks. Fed Chair Jerome Powell didn\u2019t give hints about when the central bank could start cutting rates during his congressional testimony earlier this week. But he acknowledged that inflation has moderated and that the labor market is \u201cstrong, but not overheated\u201d \u2014 a departure from even just a few months ago, when inflation showed signs of reaccelerating and the jobs market remained red-hot. Still, the Fed will have to parse more data before its September meeting, which could alter its trajectory. Some economists worry that if the Fed doesn\u2019t cut rates by then, cracks could begin to deepen in the labor market. Some investors are concerned that the economy could weaken dangerously even before then. A September rate cut \u201cmay not be the magic elixir some investors are seeking,\u201d wrote Brent Schutte, chief investment officer at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management, in a Monday note. Prices fell in June for the first time since the start of the pandemic Americans weighed down by fast-rising prices for three years just received more encouraging news on the inflation front, reports my colleague Alicia Wallace. The Consumer Price Index, a measurement of the average change in prices for a commonly purchased basket of goods and services, dropped 0.1% from May, which helped to slow the annual rate of inflation to 3% from 3.3% in May, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 latest report. Falling gas prices as well as a drop in new and used car prices helped to usher in the first month-on-month decline since May 2020, BLS data showed. On an annual basis, consumer prices are increasing at their slowest pace since June 2023, matching the lowest annual rate since early 2021. Excluding energy and food prices, a closely watched \u201ccore\u201d index of underlying inflation also slowed more than expected. The core CPI rose 0.1% from May \u2014 its slowest pace since August 2021 \u2014 nudging the annual rate of core inflation lower, to 3.3% from 3.4%, and marking a fresh three-year low.

After rising prices turned customers off, the restaurants recently responded by unveiling value menus. For instance, McDonald\u2019s has a $5 value meal, which includes a McDouble cheeseburger or a McChicken sandwich, plus small french fries, 4-piece chicken nuggets and a small soft drink. At Taco Bell, you can now get two different kinds of tacos, a five-layer burrito, chips with nacho cheese sauces and a medium drink for $7. That\u2019s 55% cheaper than ordering the items individually. Like McDonald\u2019s, Burger King is offering a $5 meal bundle where customers can select one of three kinds of burgers to pair with chicken nuggets and a beverage. But just how much value is there in these kinds of \u201cvalue\u201d meals? Well, actually, not as much as you may think, since prices for many key ingredients used in value meals are coming down. In other words: You\u2019re paying the going rate (or more).

{"id": "2024_04_24_tech_nokia-moon-4g-network-nasa-spc", "text": "Texting on the Moon? Streaming on Mars? It may not be as far away as you think. That\u2019s the shared vision of NASA and Nokia, who have partnered to set up a cellular network on the Moon to help lay the building blocks for long-term human presence on other planets. A SpaceX rocket is due to launch this year \u2014 the exact date has yet to be confirmed \u2014 carrying a simple 4G network to the Moon. The lander will install the system at the Moon\u2019s south pole and then it will be remotely controlled from Earth. \u201cThe first challenge to getting a network up and running is having a space-qualified cellular equipment that meets the appropriate size, weight, and power requirements, as well as being deployed without a technician,\u201d Walt Engelund, deputy associate administrator for programs at NASA\u2019s Space Technology Mission Directorate, told CNN. No less of a challenge, it will need to operate in the harsh lunar environment of extreme temperatures and radiation. The 4G network unit is being built by Nokia\u2019s Bell Labs using a range of off-the-shelf commercial components. It will be loaded onto a lander made by US company Intuitive Machines, and once deployed it will connect the lander via radio equipment to two roaming vehicles with their own special mission: to search for ice. One of the vehicles, the Lunar Outpost rover, will explore the area known as Shackleton Connecting Ridge, while the other, the Micro-Nova hopper, will plunge into a crater to scan for unprecedented up-close evidence of Moon ice. Images of ice \u2014 transmitted back to the lander and then Earth in near real-time via the cellular network \u2014 would be a world-first. Lunar ice could be used to create breathable oxygen, and even fuel that could eventually be used to launch Mars missions from the Moon. For NASA\u2019s Artemis program, which aims to return astronauts to the moon this decade, cellular connectivity is invaluable. Currently, astronauts talk to each other by radio, but NASA wants a lunar communications system capable of supporting high-resolution video and science data, said Engelund \u2014 especially as Artemis missions become more sophisticated. \u201cBeing able to communicate on the Moon is critical to Artemis \u2014 as critical as any other mission element like power, water to drink, and air to breathe,\u201d said Engelund. \u201cEventually, this effort will help establish a lunar communications network that could give our explorers the ability to beam scientific data back, confer with mission control, and talk to their families, as if they were walking down the street on their cellphones.\u201d It could lay the groundwork for an off-world internet not dissimilar to that of Earth\u2019s. Personal devices could connect to such networks, allowing \ufeffspace colonists to use smartphones that can access all the apps and services available to those back on Earth. NASA selected Bell Labs as part of its Tipping Point initiative, a series of partnerships with companies to develop technologies for future missions that puts them in prime position for key roles in the future space economy. Bell Labs was given a $14.1 million grant in 2020, and in January, Nokia was selected by the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to begin working on a communications services infrastructure that will eventually serve as the \u201cframework for the lunar economy.\u201d \u201cA future lunar economy will critically depend on communication technologies to collect and analyze data, share information, and maintain and control operations,\u201d Thierry Klein, president of Bell Labs Solutions Research, told CNN. \u201cThis includes sustaining a semi-permanent or permanent human presence on the Moon, as well as automated robotic operations for transportation, resource mining, mineral processing and scientific data collection.\u201d There are potential commercial benefits for Earthly business ventures too. If a network can withstand the journey into orbit, then deploy and endure autonomously amid the vacuum of space, wildly fluctuating temperatures and cosmic radiation, it will be able to survive the harshest locations on Earth \u2014 such as polar ice caps, deserts, or offshore platforms. \u201cEspecially when it comes to remote deployments, industrial sites, public safety, emergency response, disaster recovery or defense, it is highly beneficial to have compact, low-footprint network equipment that can be easily transported and deployed anywhere,\u201d Klein said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/24/tech/nokia-moon-4g-network-nasa-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/13/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2023_11_21_opinions_sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic", "text": "The biggest tech news this week is the\u00a0ouster\u00a0of Sam Altman from his role as CEO of OpenAI, a move that has shaken the company and the industry. Hundreds of OpenAI employees have threatened to\u00a0resign. Altman has already\u00a0moved on\u00a0to a role at Microsoft. And OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is on its\u00a0third CEO\u00a0in as many days. It\u2019s all very juicy. But this drama should also be raising larger questions, far beyond one company\u2019s internal hirings and firings, including: Who are the people making the decisions\u00a0that will determine so much of our technological future? What guiding principles are they using to make those decisions? And how should other institutions \u2013 governments, non-tech industries, global alliances, regulatory bodies \u2013 reign in the worst excesses of potentially dangerous AI innovators? OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, with an explicit mission to harness what may soon be superhuman intelligence \u201cto benefit humanity as a whole.\u201d But that sensibility hasn\u2019t lasted. The company now has a multi-billion-dollar for-profit arm. They have been developing new technologies at lightning speed, and sometimes sending them out to the public\u00a0before some employees believed they were ready. The company has already reportedly invented an AI technology so dangerous they will never release it \u2013 but they also\u00a0won\u2019t tell\u00a0reporters or the public exactly what it is. This dynamic \u2013 a potentially dangerous technology developed at extreme speed, largely behind closed doors \u2013 is partly to blame for Altman\u2019s firing. The OpenAI board, according to\u00a0CNN\u2019s David Goldman, worried that \u201cthe company was making the technological equivalent of a nuclear bomb, and its caretaker, Sam Altman, was moving so fast that he risked a global catastrophe.\u201d At particular issue seemed to be Altman\u2019s efforts to make the tools behind ChatGPT available to anyone who wanted to make their own version of the chatbot. This could be widely disastrous, some board members worried. But then they fired him without warning, and apparently without involving Microsoft, the company\u2019s largest shareholder. Now, Altman is at the new AI group at Microsoft, and one has to wonder if the oversight and caution there will be on par with that at OpenAI, or if he\u2019ll be handed carte blanche to push as fast and hard as he wants. And for all the justified reticence of the OpenAI board, the company has carried out much of its work in secrecy \u2013 without the public really understanding what a handful of unaccountable technologists are building, and how it is nearly guaranteed to indelibly change their lives. AI is broadly understood to have the potential to reshape vast swaths of human existence. At the very least, it seems nearly guaranteed to change how we process information, how we communicate, how we learn and how we work (and if we work). And the ramifications could be much more extreme. AI technologies have already demonstrated the ability\u00a0to lie and to cover their tracks. They have already been able to\u00a0suggest the design\u00a0to make a virus spread more quickly. Many researchers\u00a0acutely understand\u00a0just how quickly these machines could develop the capacity to annihilate us, including Altman: He has a prepper\u2019s paradise prepared in Big Sur, complete with guns and \u201cgas masks from the Israeli Defense Force\u201d in case AI goes off the rails and the robots go to war against humans,\u00a0according to reporting in the New Yorker. But don\u2019t worry, he told an Atlantic reporter: If AI is determined to wipe us out, \u201cno gas mask is helping anyone.\u201d (If you want an excellent and terrifying rundown of AI\u2019s risks \u2013 at least those we understand right now, which are almost certainly a mere sliver of the looming perils \u2013\u00a0the Atlantic profile of Altman and his technology\u00a0is worth a read). AI is very exciting technology. But it is also a potentially very dangerous one, and not in the social media sense of \u201cit may give us bad self-esteem and make us lonelier\u201d but in the sense of \u201cit could break down human societies and kill us all.\u201d Given the life-altering potential of AI \u2013 that even if it doesn\u2019t kill us all, it will almost certainly change human existence in unprecedented ways at unprecedented speed \u2013 we all have a stake in how it\u2019s being developed. And yet the development is being left to a handful of people (who seem to be\u00a0largely\u00a0men) in Silicon Valley, and other tech pockets around the globe. And we all have a stake in whose interests AI will serve \u2013 and right now, its development is being funded with billions of dollars by people expecting to make a huge profit. Do the interests of the public align with the interests of the shareholders to whom profit-driven, potentially tremendously lucrative-for-a-few companies are beholden? Or with the interests of tech entrepreneurs who are primarily excited about being at the forefront of the AI revolution, regardless of the potential human costs? One thing is clear: AI is coming. And how it is built and unleashed on the public matters more than perhaps any technology of the past century. It is, indeed, up there with the atom bomb in its destructive potential \u2013 except likely more difficult to regulate and control. \u201cRegulation\u201d does not begin to scratch the surface of what\u2019s needed to make sure that the AI future is not a catastrophic one, especially since the development of AI is now a massive international arms race, with particularly horrific implications if bad actors develop this technology first. But regulation is, at minimum, a necessary step. So is transparency: In the US, companies have wide leverage to work behind a veil of secrecy, and much of what AI companies do is kept secret to stymy competition. But the public certainly has a right to understand what life-altering technologies are set to be inflicted upon us, and what the creators are doing to protect humanity \u2013 our jobs, our communities, our families, our connections, our educations and our abilities to build a life of purpose, but also our lives and our safety. The Altman story is fascinating because Altman is the most powerful figure in AI technology, which in effect makes him one of the most powerful men in the world. But that should give us pause: Who is he, what power does he hold, what is he doing with it, who does he answer to, and are we comfortable with this much life-altering potential being held by a few unaccountable people?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/21/opinions/sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/13/2024", "section": "business"}}

PepsiCo\u2019s snack unit Frito-Lay posted a dip in revenue in its second quarter Thursday after multiple quarters of price increases. Years of inflation have resulted in \u201ctighter household financial conditions,\u201d the company said in prepared remarks, so \u201cperformance across  many food categories, including snacks, has been subdued and consumers have become more value-conscious.\u201d As a result, the company is weighing some cost-cutting and boosting promotions for its portfolio of brands, which include Cheetos, Lay\u2019s, Doritos and Smartfood, among other snacks. While inflation has slowed down, American customers still haven\u2019t recovered from higher prices in everyday categories like snacks. Everyone from President Joe Biden to the Cookie Monster has complained about \u201cshrinkflation\u201d in snacks, which is when companies cut the size of their products to save on costs. Snack shoppers are responding by either buying fewer chips or going private-label. In recent months,\u00a0a slew of major retailers\u00a0have\u00a0announced price cuts. That trend could continue as consumers become more restrained, CNN previously reported. The average price of potato chips in June 2024 was $6.56; in June 2020, as the pandemic was taking off, the average price was $5.09, according to Federal Reserve data. \u201cThere is some value to be given back to consumers after three or four years of a lot of inflation,\u201d PepsiCo chairman and CEO Ramon Laguarta said in a call to investors. Certain products, like unsalted potato chips or tortilla chips, could see a \u201cvalue reset\u201d and have lower prices, Laguarta said. Laguarta said adjustments must be made for \u201ccertain consumers\u201d in parts of Frito-Lay\u2019s broad portfolio. Laguarta said the company is investing in customers looking for a deal. The company said it would offer broader price tiers, using its variety multipacks that are often cheaper per bag, as an example. It\u2019s boosting its marketing and in-store promotional placements for cheaper products. \u201cIn the US, there is clearly a consumer that is more challenged and is a consumer that is telling us that in particular parts of our portfolio, they want more value to stay with our brands,\u201d Laguarta told investors.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/12/business/snackers-are-tired-of-high-prices/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/13/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_12_economy_banks-free-checking", "text": "Most banks offer free checking if, for instance, customers have their paycheck direct deposited or they maintain an average minimum balance. The majority of people with checking accounts (73%) take advantage of the option, according to a 2023 Bankrate.com survey. But if regulatory costs go up for banks, free services like checking may go away, at least if they follow Chase\u2019s lead. Marianne Lake, the head of Chase Bank, told the Wall Street Journal last week that Chase might stop offering free checking and other free banking services. \u201cConsumer banking is predicated on banks providing services for\u00a0free\u00a0to consumers such as\u00a0checking\u00a0accounts, debit cards and electronic bill paying. The model then relied on banks being able to recoup those costs elsewhere in the consumer banking business, such as with debit interchange fees, overdraft fees, late fees and higher interest rates,\u201d Jaret Seiberg, financial services analyst at TD Securities, wrote in an analysis of Lake\u2019s comments. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, for instance, has finalized a rule that caps credit card late fees at $8. However, it is not in effect yet because it is being litigated. The CFPB also has proposed that banks be limited in how much they can charge customers in overdraft fees. Separately, the Federal Reserve is expected to further limit how much banks can charge merchants when customers use their bank debit cards to make a purchase. While banks \u2014 especially smaller ones trying to attract deposits \u2014 may still have to offer incentives to bring in customers, one consumer advocate doesn\u2019t see customers running for the exits if their bank does in fact impose a fee on their checking account at some point in the next couple of years. Bank accounts can last longer than a marriage \u201cPeople tend to stick with their bank accounts \u2014 sometimes more than they stick with marriages,\u201d said Adam Rust, director of financial services at the Consumer Federation of America. Rust is kidding/not kidding, apparently. Bankrate found that the average US consumer has had the same checking account for nearly 18 years. The median duration of first marriages that end in divorce is eight years, at least the last time the Census Bureau checked, which was in 2009. The top three reasons people cited in Bankrate\u2019s survey for staying with their bank were: \u201cHappy with customer service,\u201d \u201cAlways had the account\u201d and \u201cConvenient branch or ATMs.\u201d Apart from those reasons, Rust suggests another factor that might dissuade people from changing banks for any reason: With automated bill payment options, the idea of disentangling yourself from Old Faithful might seem like more hassle than it\u2019s worth. He noted that you may have information on 10 to 20 service providers that you pay regularly embedded in your bank account records. So, if you were to switch banks, you might have to manually switch them all over. In any case, he added, paying a modest fee for your checking account might not be the worst thing. That\u2019s especially true if the reason your bank is tacking one on is because it will be limited in how much it can charge you for other things, like overdrafts. That\u2019s because upfront pricing is more transparent than being hit with higher, backend surprise fees. And it\u2019s not like you\u2019re not getting anything in exchange for a checking fee. \u201cA bank account is very useful,\u201d Rust said. The average overdraft fee was close to $27 last year, according to Bankrate, which noted some banks charge as much as $38. The average fee on interest-bearing checking accounts, meanwhile, was $15.33. And the average fee for noninterest-bearing checking accounts was just $5.31. Of course, if your money is with one of the largest retail banks in the country, such as Chase, you might skip the interest-bearing option altogether unless you have a high balance. That\u2019s because the average interest paid is around 0.01%, despite credit card rates being at record highs after the Fed embarked on a rate-hiking spree in the past two years to tame inflation. All that said, your free checking options might not disappear if a bank\u2019s regulatory costs don\u2019t change because there is too much pushback, or legal challenges prevail. Or, if those costs do rise, maybe some banks might decide for various reasons not to eliminate free checking. For instance, after passage in 2009 of the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act (CARD Act), which limited some fees and interest charges, the CFPB found in 2015 that \u201ctotal costs to consumers have fallen \u2026 and credit has generally become more available to consumers.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/12/economy/banks-free-checking/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/13/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_07_11_media_white-house-press-corps-biden", "text": "For weeks,\u00a0the White House press corps has been boiling \u2013 and not from the Washington, DC, heat. They\u2019re frustrated. Some feel the White House misled the press before President Joe Biden\u2019s stumbling performance at last month\u2019s CNN presidential debate. Others have been exasperated by the White House\u2019s response since then to questions about the president\u2019s health, often leading to follow-ups and clarifications from the administration on otherwise straightforward questions. And nearly all of the White House correspondents who spoke to CNN for this report felt the president should have held a press conference with reporters in the immediate aftermath of the debate. Now, two weeks after Biden\u2019s eye-opening debate performance, journalists from the nation\u2019s biggest news outlets will finally get their chance to question the president directly when Biden takes questions Thursday evening during the NATO summit. Expect fireworks. Since the debate, the journalists tasked with covering the White House have been imploring the president\u2019s communications team \u2013 who said the debate was just a \u201cbad night\u201d \u2013 to prove it, allowing him to take questions directly from the press. \u201cThis is a period of time here where the public is trying to understand what happened,\u201d NBC\u2019s Kelly O\u2019Donnell said on July 2. \u201cAnd the president could help to answer that by engaging with us in an unscripted way right now.\u201d In the weeks since the debate, a media frenzy has erupted around Biden, with the White House and Biden campaign\u00a0coming under intense scrutiny for any sign that aides are attempting to shield the president or potentially cover up any of his missteps that might show a decline. The\u00a0discontent has been on full display in the White House briefing room, where reporters have openly sparred with press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, particularly over the president\u2019s medical history. Amid pushback from the press, the White House has been forced to revisit answers to some questions. CBS News senior White House correspondent\u00a0Ed O\u2019Keefe laid it all out during a dust-up with Jean-Pierre on Monday. \u201cWell, we\u2019re a little miffed around here about how information has been shared with the press corps,\u201d he\u00a0said.\u00a0\u201cYou answer it incorrectly and then have to come back and clean it up a few days later.\u201d \u201cNo, wait a minute,\u201d Jean-Pierre replied. \u201cCalm \u2014 Ed, please.\u00a0A little respect here, please.\u201d Jean-Pierre said she and the White House communications staff have been doing \u201cour best in this briefing to provide the information that we have.\u201d \u201cI will be the first one to admit: Sometimes I get it wrong. At least I admit that,\u201d she added. But the exchange was symbolic of the growing distrust between the White House communications team and the press corps, which has bristled over\u00a0what they perceive to be\u00a0a lack of transparency and access to Biden, who has conducted fewer press conferences than his recent predecessors. The following day, Jean-Pierre was asked about a neurologist\u2019s visit to the White House earlier this year, which she denied had been related to the president. But later that evening, Jean-Pierre\u00a0issued a statement\u00a0correcting her comments. \u201cThis is the second time in less than a week where the briefing had prompted a need for later clarification on questions about the president\u2019s health,\u201d Associated Press White House reporter Seung Min Kim said in the briefing room Tuesday. It turned out the neurologists\u2019 visits were not all related to the president, after a breathless news cycle that, at times, implied the president was being treated for Parkinson\u2019s (the White House says he is not).\u00a0But while the tense moments in the briefing room may seem to focus on small details and semantics, for the press it\u2019s about credibility. \u201cI think this is a credibility crisis writ large for the White House, and certainly as a spokesperson for the White House, this is a credibility crisis for her,\u201d one White House reporter told CNN, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the situation. \u201cIf they were answering truthfully, with a sense of fidelity to the question in a well-meaning way, you wouldn\u2019t necessarily see (those blow-ups in the briefing room),\u201d the reporter added. The reporter said the press corps has not suddenly decided \u201cto get tough\u201d on the White House in wake of the debate, noting that reporters have been frustrated with how Jean-Pierre has answered from the podium for more than a year and a half. \u201cWe saw the debate. We asked questions. The answers that we got in response to those questions were unsatisfactory,\u201d the reporter said. \u201cAnd so we\u2019re reporters, looking, probing when given unsatisfactory answers.\u201d In a statement to CNN, White House spokesman Andrew Bates defended Jean-Pierre, saying she \u201ctakes hard questions every day, providing thorough answers\u201d and represents President Biden \u201cwith grace and integrity.\u201d \u201cAnd she does that with respect, knowing it\u2019s the obligation of journalists to constantly ask for more information; and that if any White House press corps, in any administration, were ever satisfied they would not be doing their jobs,\u201d Bates said. \u201cWhatever disagreements she may have with reporters, she never gives anonymous quotes criticizing any of them. Instead, she keeps her office door open.\u201d Even before the debate, Biden has held fewer press conferences than his most recent predecessors. Biden has held 36 press conferences thus far in his presidency, fewer than former presidents Donald Trump, Barack Obama and George W. Bush at the same point in their presidencies. While the White House has countered that\u00a0Biden has held\u00a0more\u00a0off-the-cuff interactions with the press than his predecessors while traveling to events and meetings, reporters say those are nowhere near the same as an open format press conference. Bates said Biden has \u201cproudly fought for the rights of journalists in the world and spoken forcefully about the \u2018critical\u2019 role of the press in American democracy \u2013 rather than slander them as \u2018enemies of the people.\u2019 In line with those values, his team reinstated daily press briefings and works hard to be informative and factual, including by releasing more documentation on policy than at any time in American history.\u201d But a former White House staffer under President Bill Clinton told CNN that Biden\u2019s team had deployed an astute strategy to not put the president in front of the media\u00a0as often because they have to \u201cplay to his strengths, which is not a news conference.\u201d \u201cThe media\u2019s game is,\u00a0\u2018let\u2019s do a press conference, because that\u2019s the only way you can demonstrate to us.\u2019 Well, guess what? They don\u2019t need to demonstrate to the media. They need to demonstrate to the country,\u201d the former staffer said. \u201cAnd if I were advising them, I would say, play to his strengths. And if that means fixed events, that means, you know, less formal interviews, whatever it is, that\u2019s what I tell them to do.\u201d But as questions continue to swirl around Biden\u2019s mental fitness, a mounting challenge for the White House and Biden\u2019s campaign is the growing belief that the White House and campaign have not been transparent about his condition. \u201cWe are in the midst of a full-blown feeding frenzy,\u201d former CNN White House correspondent and Washington bureau chief Frank Sesno said. Sesno and former White House correspondents and officials told CNN that questions surrounding Biden\u2019s age and performance, along with how the White House is handling the issue, are legitimate and warrant scrutiny. But they cautioned that the emphasis of the reporting needs to be on how Biden has fundamentally changed over time. \u201cIf a subtext takes hold in the press corps, it\u2019s very, very difficult for a president to break out of that, and Biden is dealing with that today \u2014 that he\u2019s too old,\u201d said Kenneth Walsh, the author of \u201cThe Architects of Toxic Politics in America\u201d and a former White House correspondent for U.S. News & World Report. \u201cThat\u2019s the story that we\u2019re all focused on now, because we see evidence of it, and so it\u2019s a rather easy story to do, and it\u2019s a dramatic story, and it\u2019s valuable to keep people focused on it because we think it\u2019s important to understanding this president.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/media/white-house-press-corps-biden/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/13/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_04_23_cars_electric-vehicle-sales-forecast-iea", "text": "Global electric vehicle sales are set to rise by more than a fifth to reach 17 million this year, powered by drivers in China, according to the International Energy Agency. In a report Tuesday, the IEA projected that \u201csurging demand\u201d for EVs over the next decade was set \u201cto remake the global auto industry and significantly reduce oil consumption for road transport.\u201d It expects half of all cars sold globally to be electric by 2035, up from more than one in five this year, provided charging infrastructure keeps pace. The IEA includes battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid vehicles in its definition of EVs. The agency\u2019s bullish long-term outlook for EVs \u2014 based on current government policies \u2014 comes just days after the world\u2019s biggest battery EV maker Tesla slashed its prices in major markets to counter declining sales and growing competition from Chinese upstarts and established carmakers. Recent negative headlines about slowing EV penetration are out of step with positive global trends, according to IEA executive director Fatih Birol. The data \u201cdoes not at all show a reverse of the growth of electric cars. It shows an extremely robust increase of global electric car sales,\u201d he told reporters Tuesday. The growth is not driven just by Chinese buyers. The number of new battery electric cars sold in the European Union rose almost 4% in the first quarter of this year compared with the same period in 2023, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 Association. In a statement, Birol said: \u201cRather than tapering off, the global EV revolution appears to be gearing up for a new phase of growth.\u201d Despite the upbeat trends, EV makers are grappling with slim profit margins, squeezed by price wars as competition heats. In the past few days, Tesla and Chinese EV maker Li Auto have cut prices on major models in China, the world\u2019s biggest EV market, with Tesla also cutting prices in Germany and the United States. Earlier this month, Tesla posted its first annual drop in sales in nearly four years. The company\u2019s stock has plunged more than 40% so far this year. China\u2019s BYD has also stumbled after it briefly surpassed Tesla as global market leader, with its sales falling to about 300,000 in the first quarter from more than 525,000 in the final three months of 2023. Automakers may be hurting from the price cuts but they will be crucial to increasing the take-up of EVs around the world, according to the IEA, which emphasized that the \u201cpace of the transition to EVs\u2026 will hinge on affordability.\u201d In China, more than 60% of EVs sold last year were less expensive than conventional cars, but in Europe and the United States the purchase price for new cars with internal combustion engines remains lower on average. \u201cIntensifying market competition and improving battery technologies are expected to reduce (EV) prices in the coming years,\u201d the IEA said. \u201cGrowing electric car exports from Chinese automakers, which accounted for more than half of all electric car sales in 2023, could add to downward pressure on purchase prices,\u201d it added. Last year, Chinese carmakers accounted for more than half of global electric car sales, compared with their 10% share of the conventional car market. \u201cChina is the de facto leader of electric car manufacturing around the world,\u201d Birol said. Concerns about soaring imports of Chinese EVs prompted the European Union to open an investigation late last year into China\u2019s state support for EV makers. The auto industry is a major employer in Europe and crucial to the region\u2019s biggest economy, Germany, which is home to Volkswagen, Audi and BMW. EV sales in China will account for almost 60% of the global total this year and about 45% of all car sales in the country. By 2030, almost one in three cars on the roads in China is set to be electric, up from fewer than one in 10 last year, according to the IEA. That compares with its forecast for 17% in the United States and 18% in the European Union, compared with just over 2% and almost 4% respectively last year. \u201cThis shift will have major ramifications for both the auto industry and the energy sector,\u201d Birol said. The IEA sees global oil demand peaking in 2030, helped by the electrification of the transport sector. In addition to affordability, another barrier to mass adoption of electric cars is a lack of public charging infrastructure in Europe and the United States. Under current government policies, the number of public EV charging points worldwide is expected to reach 15 million by the end of the decade, a near-fourfold increase from last year, according to the IEA.
