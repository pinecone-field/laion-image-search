Tesla is the only foreign-owned EV car brand on the purchase catalog published by the government of Jiangsu province in eastern China. The other brands mentioned include Volvo, owned by China\u2019s Geely, and state-owned SAIC. That means that government agencies and public groups in the province can procure them as service cars, highlighting the cozy relationship China has with Elon Musk\u2019s company. The development has gone viral on Chinese social media, with some users questioning if foreign cars should be considered for use by the government. The Jiangsu government has tried to ease such concerns by saying that the Tesla model is \u201ca domestic car, not imported,\u201d according to a report by state-owned National Business Daily on Thursday, citing a government employee. Tesla, which has a massive gigafactory in Shanghai, manufactured some 947,000 cars in China in 2023, and most of them were used locally. The Jiangsu government did not respond to CNN\u2019s phone calls. On the government\u2019s purchase catalog, Tesla\u2019s Shanghai-made Model Y was listed at 249,900 yuan ($34,377). China has become an increasingly important market for Tesla, as the country accounts for more than half of the world\u2019s total EV sales. Last year, Tesla derived nearly a quarter of its total revenue from China. But the US carmaker is also facing rising competition from Chinese rivals. BYD overtook Tesla in the final quarter of 2023 as the biggest seller of EVs on the planet. Tesla regained its position in the first half of this year, but they are neck and neck. Tesla cars had previously been\u00a0barred from entering\u00a0some government and military complexes in China due to spying and data security concerns. Those restrictions were lifted in April, when a top auto association announced that Tesla\u2019s cars had passed China\u2019s data security requirements.\u00a0The announcement came on the same day as Musk visited Beijing and met with Premier Li Qiang, who praised Tesla as a \u201csuccessful model\u201d for US-China collaboration. EU tariffs But, on most fronts, tensions between China and the West are increasing. The European Commission confirmed on Thursday that it would slap additional tariffs of up to 37.6% from Friday on imports of electric vehicles made in China. The tariffs, which were first announced in early June, are seen as a necessary move by the EU to deter a flood of cheap Chinese cars built with \u201cunfair\u201d support from the government. Tesla, a major exporter of China-made EVs to Europe, has requested a separate tariff rate calculation, according to the Commission. Currently, the company faces an average 20.8% additional tariff as part of a group of companies cooperating with the EU\u2019s investigation. Tesla didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/business/tesla-enters-chinese-government-purchase-list-for-first-time-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_business_japan-pufferfish-cup-noodles-release-intl-hnk", "text": "Pufferfish is regarded as a luxury in Japan and a meal featuring the potentially poisonous delicacy can easily cost up to 20,000 yen ($125) at high-end restaurants. But now, adventurous foodies in Japan can get a taste of \u201cfugu\u201d for a fraction of the price, from a cup noodle. Japanese instant noodle giant Nissin Foods released the new pufferfish flavor on Monday, expanding its massive lineup. The noodles sell for a recommended price of 298 yen ($1.90). The \u201cessence\u201d of pufferfish is condensed into a small packet of oil to be added to the soup base, Nissin said in a statement on its website, though it did not divulge how the potentially deadly flavoring is prepared. \u201cIn recent years \u2026 ramen shops specializing in fugu ramen have been popping up, grabbing the hearts of many ramen fans,\u201d it said. A Nissin spokesperson told CNN it has no plans to sell the fugu flavor outside Japan. Each cup comes with dried chicken meatballs, spring onions and Japanese-style shredded egg in a\u00a0soup base enriched by a dash of yuzu, according to the statement. A CNN journalist who tried the instant noodles said it tasted of seafood broth and yuzu, a citrus fruit commonly used in Japanese cooking. Fugu generally has a mild flavor, which wasn\u2019t prominent in the dish. Nissin was founded in 1958 by Momofuku Ando, who saw a need for cheap, accessible food amid shortages following the end of World War II. The company has since expanded into an international household name synonymous with its signature cup noodles. The company posted revenue of more than 732 billion yen ($4.59 billion) in the year to March 2024. While pufferfish, served regularly as sashimi or in hot pot, is a prized item in the Japanese culinary world, almost all of them are poisonous and could, in serious cases, cause death if not properly prepared. The fish\u2019s organs, skin, blood and bones contain high concentrations of tetrodotoxin, a deadly poison.\u00a0Eating it can cause tingling around the mouth and dizziness, which may be followed by convulsions, respiratory paralysis and death, medical experts say. According to Western Australia\u2019s Department of Fisheries, pufferfish, which are found in tropical and subtropical ocean waters,\u00a0are the second most poisonous vertebrate in the world after the golden poison frog, which is native to Colombia. Chefs in Japan must train for at least two years before being allowed to take an examination to qualify to prepare fugu. In 2018, a supermarket in Gamagori city, in Japan\u2019s central Aichi prefecture, issued an alert after two people consumed potentially dangerous fugu products they bought from a supermarket. The pair did not report any health problems, but authorities found that a licensed employee had failed to remove the fish\u2019s poisonous livers. The Japanese delicacy has also been gaining traction overseas in recent years, though it has caused the occasional food scare. In 2020, three people died in the Philippines after they ate pufferfish from a barbecue stand. An elderly couple in Malaysia died last year after eating pufferfish, prompting an appeal from their daughter for stricter regulations. The two, in their early 80s, unknowingly purchased at least two pufferfish from an online vendor and died after consuming them.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/business/japan-pufferfish-cup-noodles-release-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_04_economy_us-jobs-report-june-preview", "text": "The US labor market has held its own despite swirling forces \u2014 high inflation, an aggressive interest-rate-hiking campaign, pandemic aftershocks and geopolitical uncertainty \u2014 that seemed all but certain to trigger a recession. Monthly job gains have frequently come in stronger than expected, and unemployment has held at or below 4% for 30 consecutive months. That said, the job market of today is far different than it was 30 months ago. \u201cThe labor market has normalized,\u201d Luke Tilley, Wilmington Trust\u2019s chief economist, told CNN in an interview. But, he cautioned, \u201cthe concern would be if it worsened from here.\u201d Economists don\u2019t believe job gains will fall off a cliff when the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases employment data for June on Friday morning. In fact, the monthly payroll gains should remain strong and steady, but gradually cooling: Economists expect the US added 190,000 jobs last month, a pullback from the stronger-than-expected 272,000 gain in May, and for unemployment to hold steady at 4%, according to FactSet consensus estimates. Still, there\u2019s a growing chorus of data that shows the economy is slowing, consumer spending is letting up and workers are feeling less secure. As such, Friday\u2019s report could provide a crucial signal as to whether the jobs market is at a stable or even pre-pandemic state \u2014 or is perhaps weaker than advertised. \u201cI think as long as the job gains continue to show a gradual cooling, this economy is in good shape,\u201d said Nela Richardson, ADP\u2019s chief economist, during a call with reporters on Wednesday following the payroll processor\u2019s latest report showing job and wage gains slowed in the private sector. ADP estimated that private employers added 150,000 jobs last month, down from 157,000 in May. \u201cIf we see the cooldown go from gradual to steep, I think that\u2019s a warning,\u201d she said. Whether the two surveys will still tell different tales In May, the two surveys that feed into the monthly jobs report appeared to be telling different stories: The business survey showed employers adding jobs at a still-robust pace, and the household survey showed a 408,000 drop in employment. While the establishment survey is considered the \u201cgold standard\u201d by economists, the household survey, which provides greater detail on demographics and feeds into the unemployment rate, is viewed as more volatile because of its smaller sample size and declining response rates. \u201cThe establishment and household surveys are continuing to show diametrically opposed pictures of the labor market,\u201d Dean Baker, economist and co-founder of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, wrote in a note issued earlier this week. \u201cThe persistence of this large divergence is disconcerting,\u201d he added. \u201cMost other data seem to fit better with the establishment survey, although we are seeing evidence of a weakening labor market.\u201d Notably, there are fewer job openings, hiring has pulled back, people aren\u2019t as willing to test the waters and are staying put in their current jobs; and, perhaps most importantly, layoff activity has been climbing steadily higher in recent weeks. Are permanent job losers on the rise? Last week, there were an estimated 238,000 first-time claims filed for unemployment benefits, an increase of 4,000 from the week before, according to Department of Labor data released Wednesday. The latest uptick brought the four-week average of initial claims to its highest level since August 2023. Also, Americans are staying unemployed for longer: Continuing claims, which are filed by people who have received benefits for at least a week or more, rose to their highest level since November 2021. The continued upswing in claims has Tilley closely watching an underlying datapoint of the monthly jobs report: Unemployed persons by reason for unemployment. \u201cOn a three-month average basis, it\u2019s up about 200,000 people from last year,\u201d Tilley said. \u201cAnd that metric of permanent job losers, year-over-year, is almost never positive in an expansion. It was never positive between 2010 and 2019; it was not positive in between the tech crash recession of 2001 and then 2008.\u201d He added: \u201cSo when you sort of peel back the onion from what looks like very strong job growth in a raw number count and look at it a little closer \u2026 that paints a labor market that has normalized and is at risk of slipping.\u201d Still, other measures of layoff activity haven\u2019t shown a worrisome spike. US-based employers announced fewer job cuts last month than they did in May; however, those layoff reports are trending well above last year\u2019s, according to data released Wednesday by Challenger, Gray & Christmas. The outplacement and workplace research firm counted 48,786 cuts announced in June. That\u2019s down nearly 24% from the 63,618 cuts announced in May, but 19.8% higher than the 40,709 cuts announced in June last year. How immigrants contribute to the labor market Since August 2022, monthly payroll gains have averaged 250,000 per month, which is much faster than the 2019 average of 164,000, noted Julia Pollak, chief economist at ZipRecruiter. \u201cIn other words, we\u2019re achieving much higher job growth with about the same unemployment rate, at a time when the native-born population is stagnant,\u201d Pollak told CNN via email. \u201cOne key reason is\u00a0immigration\u00a0and its effect on labor supply.\u201d Immigrants accounted for 43% of the labor force gain in 2024, Rachel Sederberg, senior economist at labor market research firm Lightcast, told CNN Business. In May, that share skyrocketed to 280%, as the immigrant gains more than made up for the native-born workers who left the labor force, she said. The job gains made by immigrants have become another flashpoint in an already heavily contentious presidential election. During the CNN debate last week between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, the latter falsely claimed that all job gains since Biden took office were made by illegal immigrants and \u201cbounce-back jobs.\u201d \u201cMost research does not find that\u00a0immigration\u00a0harms employment outcomes for native-born Americans because immigrants are both consumers and producers of goods and services, so they may increase job competition in some areas but they also increase demand for goods and services, which creates jobs,\u201d Pollak noted. Other indicators to watch Average hourly earnings: Workers\u2019 pay gains have been slowing, and that\u2019s expected to continue in June. Economists expect that the month-on-month gains should come in around 0.3%, from 0.4% in May, and for annual gains to cool to 3.9% from 4.1%. This is an indicator that Federal Reserve officials have watched closely as a potential inflationary pressure. Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Tuesday said the labor market has seen a \u201cpretty substantial move\u201d toward getting back into a better balance. While speaking at the ECB\u2019s annual conference in Portugal, Powell noted the unemployment rate was moving up toward \u201ca more sustainable level,\u201d as were wage increases. \u201cWage increases are still a bit above where they would wind up in equilibrium; but nonetheless, you can see the labor market is cooling off appropriately,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re watching it very carefully, but it doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s heating up or presenting a big problem for inflation.\u201d Labor force participation rates: While prime working-age women have experienced record-high employment in recent months, other measures of labor force participation continue to remain below pre-pandemic levels. The overall labor force participation rate dipped in May to 62.5% from 62.7%, reversing progress made earlier this year. Part-time workers: New data from employment site Indeed indicated that employers are looking to hire more part-time workers. The number of involuntary part-time workers has increased in recent months. \u201cThey\u2019d like full-time hours but can\u2019t get them, which is potentially an indicator of a softening labor market,\u201d according to Lightcast\u2019s Sederberg. \u201cThat said, the number of people who are involuntarily part time are still very, very low.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/economy/us-jobs-report-june-preview/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_01_success_buying-house-in-retirement-mortgage", "text": "Moving somewhere new when you retire isn\u2019t uncommon. But deciding whether to take out a new mortgage to buy a home is a big deal. Much of your financial life is changing as you transition from a steady paycheck to a mix of fixed and variable income and a new lifestyle. So adding a large debt to the picture isn\u2019t an easy call. That\u2019s especially true now that mortgage rates hover around 7% and home prices keep rising. \u201cAny time you take on debt, you increase risk in your situation,\u201d said Illinois-based certified financial planner Jim Stork. More than a third (35%) of homebuyers last year were between the ages of 59 and 98, according to data from the National Association of Realtors. Within that group, a majority financed their purchases. Whether taking out a new mortgage makes sense for you depends on a lot of factors, including how to prove to a lender that you\u2019re a good credit risk, plus your feelings about the debt and the ongoing cost of maintaining a home. To get a mortgage, your age won\u2019t be a factor, but your income will be If you\u2019re concerned that you may be less attractive to a mortgage banker because you\u2019ve hit retirement age, know that it is illegal to discriminate against anyone applying for a mortgage based on their age. Lenders\u2019 chief focus will be on your ability to repay your mortgage with your various sources of non-paycheck income. \u201cWhen you qualify for a mortgage, it\u2019s all based on your income,\u201d said Melissa Cohn, regional vice president at William Raveis Mortgage. That, and of course any debt you have that will soak up your income, but we\u2019ll get to that in a minute. The income sources that lenders consider, absent a regular paycheck, include: Social Security benefits, pension or annuity income, spousal benefits, disability payments, interest and dividends and your 401(k) or IRA. If a portion of your income is not subject to tax, the lender may treat it as worth 25% more. Fannie Mae offers this example: Say 15% of a $1,500 monthly Social Security benefit is tax free. That means $225 of it will not be subject to tax ($1,500 x 15%). And 25% of that amount comes to $56 ($225 x 25%). So that $56 can be added to a person\u2019s qualifying Social Security income amount ($1,500 + $56 = $1,556). If you want to use your nest egg, different methods can be used to calculate how much income it would provide. There is the asset depletion method in which your eligible assets are divided by your loan term. In the case of a 30-year mortgage, that would be 360 months. If your IRA is worth $700,000, that translates into $1,944 per month ($700,000/360). \u201cYou don\u2019t ever have to take the money out \u2014 but you can use your assets [to qualify for a mortgage] as if you were going to take the distribution,\u201d Cohn said. Another option: If you are at least 59-1/2, you can start taking monthly distributions from an IRA without penalty \u2014 or a 401(k) if your plan rules permit \u2014 and the lender will count that as income so long as you show that you have sufficient funds in the account to keep taking that same monthly distribution for three years. Once you close on your home, Cohn said, you can reduce or stop taking distributions if you choose. That assumes you are not yet in your 70s when the IRS requires you to start taking minimum distributions, said Mark Luscombe, a principal analyst at Wolters, Kluwer Tax & Accounting. Burdened by debt? Lenders will also assess your debt-to-income ratio, because no matter how much income you have, the big question is how much of it will be consumed by your debts. The debt portion is composed of your expected mortgage payment plus any credit card, student loan, car loan or other outstanding debt you may have. Generally speaking, for conventional loans your DTI ratio can be up to 50%, Cohen said. That ratio falls to between 43% and 45% if you\u2019re taking out a jumbo loan, she added. A jumbo loan exceeds the conforming loan limits in the area you want to buy. But ideally your debt level will fall well below these top limits, both for the lender\u2019s sake and yours. And, of course, the higher your credit score, the better the interest rate you can get on a mortgage. What you should consider before taking out a mortgage Even before seeking a mortgage, get a good grasp on your expected monthly income and expenses in retirement. Compared to pre-retirement earnings, \u201cMost (new retirees) see a decrease in income,\u201d said certified financial planner Lori Trawinski, director of finance and employment at AARP. While some expenses may also decline \u2014 e.g., work-related costs like commuting \u2014 others may increase over time, Trawinski said, like medical costs, property taxes, home insurance and utilities. Of course, you can downsize and move to a lower-cost area. But if you stay near where you lived during your career, your expenses are likely to rise over time. Also, Trawinski noted, if you\u2019re married, consider what will happen to your household income when one spouse dies. This will help you assess your future comfort level in carrying a mortgage. \u201cPeople often fail to plan for the death of a spouse. You can take a big hit to your income when that happens,\u201d she said. If you do move to a new state or region, weigh renting first. You can get a better sense of the cost of living in the area and decide whether it\u2019s a good fit for you. As Stork put it, \u201cFlorida in August is not as fun as Florida in January.\u201d How much are you really willing to take on? All the usual financial decisions that go into homebuying apply no matter your age. But, in retirement especially, you don\u2019t want to take on more debt than necessary, since the cost of a mortgage is fixed, but the returns on your investments, the housing market and your health needs are variable. At the very least, Stork said, consider whether you can put enough money down \u2014 at least 20% \u2014 to avoid having to pay private mortgage insurance. Beyond that, consider whether you feel comfortable keeping up \u2014 and paying for \u2014 maintenance on a home. Maintenance might amount to 2% a year of your home\u2019s value, Stork said. That amounts to $10,000 a year on a $500,000 home. Maintenance is essential in preserving the value of your house should you ever decide to sell. How would your mortgage interest rate compare to a reasonable rate of return on your investments? The decision to get a mortgage was a lot easier for retirees when rates were historically low \u2014 roughly 3% \u2014 and their nest eggs were earning a lot more. \u201cBut at today\u2019s rates it\u2019s a much harder calculation,\u201d Stork said. This is especially the case if you\u2019re a very conservative investor. \u201cIf your CDs are earning 4% and a mortgage would cost you 7%, you will lose money every day on that decision,\u201d Stork explained. To get the truest reading on what makes financial sense, compare mortgage expenses to your investment returns on an after-tax basis, Stork noted.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/01/success/buying-house-in-retirement-mortgage/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_04_23_cars_electric-vehicle-sales-forecast-iea", "text": "Global electric vehicle sales are set to rise by more than a fifth to reach 17 million this year, powered by drivers in China, according to the International Energy Agency. In a report Tuesday, the IEA projected that \u201csurging demand\u201d for EVs over the next decade was set \u201cto remake the global auto industry and significantly reduce oil consumption for road transport.\u201d It expects half of all cars sold globally to be electric by 2035, up from more than one in five this year, provided charging infrastructure keeps pace. The IEA includes battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid vehicles in its definition of EVs. The agency\u2019s bullish long-term outlook for EVs \u2014 based on current government policies \u2014 comes just days after the world\u2019s biggest battery EV maker Tesla slashed its prices in major markets to counter declining sales and growing competition from Chinese upstarts and established carmakers. Recent negative headlines about slowing EV penetration are out of step with positive global trends, according to IEA executive director Fatih Birol. The data \u201cdoes not at all show a reverse of the growth of electric cars. It shows an extremely robust increase of global electric car sales,\u201d he told reporters Tuesday. The growth is not driven just by Chinese buyers. The number of new battery electric cars sold in the European Union rose almost 4% in the first quarter of this year compared with the same period in 2023, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 Association. In a statement, Birol said: \u201cRather than tapering off, the global EV revolution appears to be gearing up for a new phase of growth.\u201d Despite the upbeat trends, EV makers are grappling with slim profit margins, squeezed by price wars as competition heats. In the past few days, Tesla and Chinese EV maker Li Auto have cut prices on major models in China, the world\u2019s biggest EV market, with Tesla also cutting prices in Germany and the United States. Earlier this month, Tesla posted its first annual drop in sales in nearly four years. The company\u2019s stock has plunged more than 40% so far this year. China\u2019s BYD has also stumbled after it briefly surpassed Tesla as global market leader, with its sales falling to about 300,000 in the first quarter from more than 525,000 in the final three months of 2023. Automakers may be hurting from the price cuts but they will be crucial to increasing the take-up of EVs around the world, according to the IEA, which emphasized that the \u201cpace of the transition to EVs\u2026 will hinge on affordability.\u201d In China, more than 60% of EVs sold last year were less expensive than conventional cars, but in Europe and the United States the purchase price for new cars with internal combustion engines remains lower on average. \u201cIntensifying market competition and improving battery technologies are expected to reduce (EV) prices in the coming years,\u201d the IEA said. \u201cGrowing electric car exports from Chinese automakers, which accounted for more than half of all electric car sales in 2023, could add to downward pressure on purchase prices,\u201d it added. Last year, Chinese carmakers accounted for more than half of global electric car sales, compared with their 10% share of the conventional car market. \u201cChina is the de facto leader of electric car manufacturing around the world,\u201d Birol said. Concerns about soaring imports of Chinese EVs prompted the European Union to open an investigation late last year into China\u2019s state support for EV makers. The auto industry is a major employer in Europe and crucial to the region\u2019s biggest economy, Germany, which is home to Volkswagen, Audi and BMW. EV sales in China will account for almost 60% of the global total this year and about 45% of all car sales in the country. By 2030, almost one in three cars on the roads in China is set to be electric, up from fewer than one in 10 last year, according to the IEA. That compares with its forecast for 17% in the United States and 18% in the European Union, compared with just over 2% and almost 4% respectively last year. \u201cThis shift will have major ramifications for both the auto industry and the energy sector,\u201d Birol said. The IEA sees global oil demand peaking in 2030, helped by the electrification of the transport sector. In addition to affordability, another barrier to mass adoption of electric cars is a lack of public charging infrastructure in Europe and the United States. Under current government policies, the number of public EV charging points worldwide is expected to reach 15 million by the end of the decade, a near-fourfold increase from last year, according to the IEA.

A network source told CNN that because the story is of \u201cnational interest,\u201d ABC decided to make it a \u201cprimetime special\u201d to air the same day the interview is taking place.

That poll found that roughly 20% of workers globally reported feeling lonely, angry or sad on a daily basis. And 41% on average say they feel stress. Those most likely to say they feel lonely were younger workers (22%), employees who worked remotely full-time (25%) and those who felt most disengaged on the job (31%). While work isn\u2019t always the cause of a person\u2019s negative daily emotions, employers should still be concerned. That\u2019s because work can either improve or worsen employees\u2019 well-being. On the one hand,\u00a0the Gallup report noted,\u00a0\u201cwhen employees find their work and work relationships meaningful, employment is associated with high levels of daily enjoyment and low levels of all negative daily emotions. Notably, half of employees who are engaged at work are thriving in life overall.\u201d On the other, researchers found that being disengaged at work can negatively affect a person\u2019s wellbeing as much as \u2014 or more than \u2014 not having a job at all. \u201cEmployees who dislike their jobs tend to have high levels of daily stress and worry, as well as elevated levels of all other negative emotions,\u201d they wrote. \u201cOn many wellbeing items (stress, anger, worry, loneliness), being actively disengaged at work is equivalent to or worse than being unemployed.\u201d Engaged managers help workers thrive The poll found that last year only 23% of employees were engaged at work, unchanged from the year prior. Gallup defines an engaged employee as someone \u201chighly involved in and enthusiastic about their work and workplace. They are psychological \u2018owners,\u2019 drive performance and innovation, and move the organization forward.\u201d But those who said they were not engaged rose by 3 percentage points to 62%. These are employees characterized as \u201cpsychologically unattached to their work and company. Because their engagement needs are not being fully met, they are putting time but not energy or passion into their work.\u201d Engagement levels are highest in so-called \u201cbest practice\u201d organizations, where three-fourths of managers on average are engaged as well as seven in 10 non-managers, Gallup said. Their best practices include leaders\u2019 emphasizing well-being at work and in life; and putting a high priority on manager hiring and development. The manager piece of the equation is especially crucial. \u201c[W]hen managers are engaged, employees are more likely to be engaged,\u201d the report said. And, it added, \u201chigh-engagement business units are likely to see significantly higher employee wellbeing \u2014 as well as higher productivity, profitability and sales \u2014 than low-engagement teams.\u201d Where the most and least stressed workers are Engagement and well-being results varied in each of the 10 regions covered by Gallup\u2019s poll. The report noted that the United States and Canada, for example, showed the highest percentage of engaged employees (33%) among all the regions studied; and the third highest percentage of thriving employees (53%), behind Australia and New Zealand (60%) and Latin America and the Caribbean (54%). But the US and Canada also ranked second among employees experiencing daily stress (49%), right behind the Middle East and North Africa (52%). By contrast, Europe showed the lowest level of employee engagement (13%). South Asia scored lowest in terms of employees described as thriving overall (13%). And countries in post-Soviet Eurasia ranked lowest in terms of daily stress (19%).", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/success/gallup-workers-economy-lonely-unhappy/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_05_economy_uk-election-labour-party-economy", "text": "British voters have handed the Labour Party its first election victory in almost two decades, hoping that a new center-left government will revive Britain\u2019s ailing economy and fix collapsing public services. The landmark moment draws the curtain on 14 years of tumultuous rule by the Conservative Party \u2014 defined by austerity, Brexit and a disastrous tax-cutting gamble \u2014 during which time incomes stagnated, living standards deteriorated and business investment dried up. The win is a triumph for Keir Starmer, a former chief prosecutor who only entered parliament in 2015. He was appointed prime minister on Friday, succeeding Rishi Sunak who resigned in the wake of the historic defeat for the Conservatives. \u201cChange begins now,\u201d Starmer said earlier in a victory speech to party workers. \u201cIt feels good, I have to be honest.\u201d But Labour\u2019s jubilation may soon give way to trepidation given the economic challenges ahead. From bankrupt local governments, crumbling infrastructure and a chronic housing shortage, to rising homelessness and a National Health Service in a state of crisis, the list of problems is long. Out of a working age population (16 to 64 years) of roughly 42.4 million, more than 2.8 million are unemployed because of chronic ill health. Some 6.7 million people are on Universal Credit in England, Scotland and Wales, a handout to help with living costs. That number includes many workers. Brits are unsurprisingly desperate for change. But the new government\u2019s capacity to fix these issues will be severely constrained by a debt burden now bigger than the size of the economy, which means tax hikes or spending cuts are inevitable. Making these problems even harder to solve: stubbornly low economic growth. The UK economy barely grew last year. Incomes are also stuck in a rut. Adjusted for inflation, pay has increased very little since 2010, which means people aren\u2019t substantially better-off. \u201cThe story (of Britain\u2019s economy) remains one of stagnation since the (global) financial crisis,\u201d the Resolution Foundation think tank wrote in a report last month. Ending stagnation will require a major uplift in investment by businesses and the government to boost productivity, a measure of economic efficiency that has been exceptionally weak for more than a decade. Higher investment would deliver \u201cthe infrastructure, the equipment and the research and development that make workers more efficient,\u201d Gregory Thwaites, a research director at the Resolution Foundation, told CNN. \u201cIf you have higher productivity growth, then you will have higher (growth in gross domestic product) and higher wages.\u201d \u2018Tiny, going on trivial\u2019 The good news is that Labour has made kickstarting economic growth \u2014 through higher public investment, a new industrial strategy, and policy reforms \u2014 its top priority. The less good news is that it has also committed to reducing sky-high government debt while largely ignoring the tough choices on tax and spending needed to achieve that goal. To some extent, the government is likely hoping economic growth will be stronger than forecast and help with both goals. \u201cYes, growth could surprise on the upside and, if it does, then the fiscal arithmetic would be easier,\u201d said Paul Johnson, director at the non-partisan Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) think tank. \u201cBut if it doesn\u2019t \u2014 and it hasn\u2019t tended to in recent years \u2014 then either we will get those cuts (to spending), or the fiscal targets will be fudged, or taxes will rise.\u201d Labour, meanwhile, insists its growth-boosting policies are \u201cfully costed.\u201d Among its more eye-catching plans is a \u00a37.3 billion ($9.3 billion) National Wealth Fund for investing in infrastructure and the green energy transition as part of a broader industrial strategy. A new publicly owned energy company, Great British Energy, will aim to decarbonize the United Kingdom\u2019s energy grid by 2030. It will cost \u00a38.3 billion ($10.6 billion) to set up, partly paid for through a windfall tax on oil and gas companies. Also a key priority for Labour: reforming Britain\u2019s planning laws, which it hopes will unlock a construction boom that delivers 1.5 million homes over the next five years, helping to make housing more affordable. While many have welcomed Labour\u2019s focus on growth, there is no shortage of skepticism over whether its thinly detailed plans will in fact achieve their goals. Apart from the substantial rise in investment for green projects, all other areas of investment will be frozen in cash terms over the next five years, the IFS points out. And planned spending increases on crumbling public services such as health and education are \u201ctiny, going on trivial,\u201d according to Johnson. \u201cDelivering genuine change will almost certainly also require putting actual resources on the table. And Labour\u2019s manifesto offers no indication that there is a plan for where the money would come from to finance this,\u201d he said in a statement. Seizing opportunities Ultimately, the government will need an uplift in investment by businesses \u2014 which has languished since the Brexit referendum in 2016 \u2014 to achieve its plans. One way Labour could help spur that investment is by setting clear and consistent green energy policies with better tax incentives, according to the Confederation of Business Industry, a business lobby group. \u201cNet zero is a big focus for many businesses,\u201d the CBI\u2019s chief economist Louise Hellem told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s really important for a government to set overall ambitions and targets\u2026 The big thing here is around certainty.\u201d Under the Conservative government, a ban on the sale of new gasoline and diesel cars, announced in 2020, was then abruptly delayed last September by five years till 2035, infuriating some automakers. Labour has said it will reverse the move \u201cto give certainty to manufacturers.\u201d It is also determined to \u201cget Britain building again,\u201d with Labour\u2019s Rachel Reeves, likely the next finance minister, describing the country\u2019s stringent planning regime as \u201cthe single greatest obstacle to our economic success.\u201d While the focus on policy certainty and planning reform is encouraging, Labour is decidedly less ambitious when it comes to a third area crucial to reviving economic growth: Britain\u2019s all-important relationship with the European Union, still its single biggest trading partner. Labour\u2019s timid plans to improve that relationship will do little to reduce the economic costs of Brexit, which has hurt UK goods trade and delivered an estimated hit to GDP of between 2% and 4% since the 2016 referendum, according to UK in a Changing Europe. The party\u2019s proposals are largely \u201ctechnical,\u201d such as cutting red tape on food trade, the think tank said in a report last month. \u201cAny gains from technical improvements will be relatively minimal: useful in reducing trade frictions but not enough to really address the continuing economic impacts of Brexit.\u201d Brexit has also damaged business investment and is expected to reduce national output by 4% over the long run compared with what it would have been if Britain had remained in the EU, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility, which produces economic forecasts for the government. Trade is projected to be around 15% lower. But in spite of Brexit, there are some bright spots on trade. For example, Britain\u2019s services exports have grown faster than the G7 average since 2021. According to the Resolution Foundation, the UK is now the world\u2019s second-largest exporter of services \u2014 a category that includes finance, law, education, architecture and the arts \u2014 behind only the United States. It has other strengths too, from strong institutions and the rule of law to world-class universities, innovative companies and a highly skilled workforce. Starmer and his new government will need to build on these strengths, and develop new ones, to create an environment ripe for growth and revive Britain\u2019s fortunes.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/economy/uk-election-labour-party-economy/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_03_business_airline-woes-despite-record-passenger-traffic", "text": "A record number of passengers are expected to pass through US airports this holiday travel week. You\u2019d think this would be a great time to run an airline. You\u2019d be wrong. Airlines face numerous problems, including higher costs, such as fuel, wages and interest rates. And problems at Boeing mean airlines have too few planes to expand routes to support a record numbers of flyers. Strong bookings can\u2019t entirely offset that financial squeeze. The good news for passengers is they will be spared most of the problems hurting airlines\u2019 bottom lines \u2014 at least in the near term. Airfares are driven far more by supply and demand, not their costs. But in the long run, the airlines\u2019 difficulties could mean fewer airline routes, less passenger choice and ultimately a less pleasant flying experience. Profit squeeze Industry analysts expect airlines to report a drop of about $2 billion in profit, or 33%, when they report financial results for the April to June period this year. That would follow losses of nearly $800 million across the industry in the first quarter. Labor costs and jet fuel prices, the airlines\u2019 two largest costs, are both sharply higher this year. Airline pilot unions just landed double-digit pay hikes to make up for years of stagnant wages; flight attendant unions now want comparable raises. Jet fuel prices are climbing because of higher demand in the summer. According to the International Air Transport Association\u2019s jet fuel monitor, prices are up 1.4% in just the last week, and about 4% in the last month.   Adding to the airlines\u2019 problems is the crisis at Boeing, as well as the less-well-publicized problems with some of the jet engines on planes from rival Airbus. Since an Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 Max jet lost a door plug on a January 5 flight, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the plane 10 minutes after takeoff, the Federal Aviation Administration has limited how many jets Boeing can make over concerns about quality and safety. As a result, airlines have dramatically reduced plans to expand their fleets and replace older planes with more fuel efficient models. In some cases, airlines have asked pilots to take time off without pay, and carriers such as Southwest and United have announced pilot hiring freezes. In addition to the problems at Boeing, hundreds of the Airbus A220 and A320 family of jets globally have also been grounded for at least a month or more to deal with engine problems. Just about all the planes with those engines have been out of sevice for at least a few days to undergo examinations. And Airbus has also cut back the number of planes it expects to deliver to airlines this year because of supply chain problems. Problems for flyers For now, competition in the industry remains fierce: There are 6% more seats available this month compared to July of 2023, according to aviation analytics firm Cirium. And that\u2019s helped to drive fares down \u2014 good news for passengers, but more bad news for airlines\u2019 profits. Southwest announced in April that it would stop serving four airports to trim costs \u2014 Bellingham International Airport\u00a0in Washington state, Cozumel International Airport\u00a0in Mexico,\u00a0Syracuse Hancock International Airport\u00a0in New York\u00a0and Houston\u2019s\u00a0George Bush Intercontinental Airport. Many more cities lost air service during the financial hard times of the pandemic. While upstart airlines are driving prices lower for travelers, those discount carriers might not survive long term. As the major carriers are making less money, many of the upstarts are flat-out losing money.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/business/airline-woes-despite-record-passenger-traffic/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "business"}}

In the lawsuit, filed Sunday in New York state court, the president\u2019s sonaccuses Fox News of unjust enrichment, intentionally inflicting emotional distress, and violating New York civil rights laws. The lawsuit makes good on\u00a0Hunter Biden\u2019s threat he made in April that he would take the network to court if it didn\u2019t immediately issue retractions and corrections. The miniseries, \u201cThe Trial of Hunter Biden,\u201d was a six-part offering on the Fox Nation digital streaming network, and was also promoted on Fox News, the cable TV channel. It featured a dramatized \u201cmock trial\u201d about Hunter Biden\u2019s overseas financial dealings that led in part to his federal tax indictment and that also fueled House Republicans\u2019 struggling impeachment inquiry into his father. Fox News\u00a0took down the miniseries\u00a0in late April, one day after Hunter Biden threatened to file a lawsuit. But according to the lawsuit, promotional materials for the miniseries are still on some Fox News-linked social media pages, and the miniseries episodes are still circulating \u201conline and in the public domain.\u201d A Fox News spokesperson claimed the lawsuit was meritless and \u201centirely politically motivated,\u201d and said the network looks forward to \u201cvindicating our rights in court.\u201d \u201cThe core complaint stems from a 2022 streaming program that Mr. Biden did not complain about until sending a letter in late April 2024,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cThe program was removed within days of the letter, in an abundance of caution, but Hunter Biden is a public figure who has been the subject of multiple investigations and is now a convicted felon. Consistent with the First Amendment, Fox News has accurately covered the newsworthy events of Mr. Biden\u2019s own making.\u201d The new lawsuit claims Fox News \u201ctargeted Mr. (Hunter) Biden in an effort to harass, annoy, alarm, and humiliate him, and tarnish his reputation.\u201d President Joe Biden\u2019s son is seeking an unspecified amount of punitive damages, as well as any profits that Fox reaped from the miniseries, and other corrective measures. \u201cThe miniseries is fictionalized; it is not a news event. It was made for the purpose of trade and advertising, and merely exploits Mr. Biden\u2019s name, image, and likeness for Fox\u2019s commercial benefit,\u201d Hunter Biden\u2019s lawyers wrote in the lawsuit. Hunter Biden\u2019s team said in the lawsuit that without his consent, Fox News \u201cunlawfully published numerous intimate images (both still and video) of Mr. Biden depicting him in the nude, depicting an unclothed or exposed intimate part of him, as well as engaged in sex acts.\u201d The right-wing network said these images originated form Hunter Biden\u2019s\u00a0infamous laptop\u00a0\u2013 data from which was leaked by allies for former President Donald Trump in 2020.

{"id": "2024_07_03_business_former-boeing-inspector-scrap-parts-assembly-lines", "text": "A former Boeing quality-control manager alleges that for years workers at its 787 Dreamliner factory in Everett, Washington, routinely took parts that were deemed unsuitable to fly out of an internal scrap yard and put them back on factory assembly lines\u00a0. In his first network TV interview, Merle Meyers, a 30-year veteran of Boeing, described to CNN what he says was an elaborate off-the-books practice that Boeing managers at the Everett factory used to meet production deadlines, including taking\u00a0damaged and improper parts from the company\u2019s scrapyard, storehouses and loading docks. A string of whistleblowers this year has raised allegations about Boeing factory lapses, including an official federal complaint\u00a0from a current employee\u00a0that Boeing hid potentially defective parts from Federal Aviation Administration inspectors, and that some of those parts likely ended up in planes. This all comes in the wake of a series of highly public safety issues that have rocked the company. Meyers\u2019 claims that lapses he witnessed\u00a0were intentional, organized efforts designed to thwart quality control processes in an effort to keep\u00a0up with demanding production schedules. Beginning in the early 2000s, Meyers says that for more than a decade, he estimates that about 50,000 parts \u201cescaped\u201d quality control\u00a0and were used to build aircraft. Those parts include everything from small items like screws to more complex assemblies like wing flaps. A single Boeing 787 Dreamliner, for example, has approximately 2.3 million parts. Most of the parts that were meant to be scrapped were often painted red to signify they were unsuitable for assembly lines, Meyers said. Yet, in some cases, that didn\u2019t stop them\u00a0 from being put into planes being assembled, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge problem,\u201d Meyers told CNN. \u201cA core requirement of a quality system is to keep bad parts and good parts apart.\u201d Airplanes are highly specified machines with much stricter safety standards than trains and cars. Their parts, materials and manufacturing processes are highly regulated. Meyers, whose job was to find quality problems at Boeing, says he believes he was forced out last year and says he was given a severance package that he is unable to discuss due to a privacy agreement he signed with Boeing. Based on conversations Meyers says he had with current Boeing workers in the time since he left the company, he believes that while employees no longer remove parts from the scrapyard, the practice of using other unapproved\u00a0parts in assembly lines continues. \u201cNow they\u2019re back to taking parts of body sections \u2013 everything \u2013 right when it arrives at the Everett site, bypassing quality, going right to the airplane,\u201d Meyers said. Company emails going back years show that Meyers repeatedly flagged the issue to Boeing\u2019s corporate investigations team, pointing out what he says were blatant violations of Boeing\u2019s safety rules. But investigators\u00a0routinely failed to enforce those rules, Meyers says, even ignoring \u201ceye witness observations\u00a0and the hard work done to ensure the safety of future passengers and crew,\u201d he wrote in an internal 2022 email provided to CNN. Meyers has also described his concerns about Boeing\u2019s quality issues to federal investigators, a Senate panel and the New York Times. In a statement to CNN, Boeing did not dispute Meyers\u2019 allegations. The company said it investigates \u201call allegations of improper behavior, such as unauthorized movement of parts or mishandling of documents,\u201d and makes improvements when appropriate. Swirl of controversy Meyers\u2019 allegations come as Boeing faces a swirl of controversy over its safety culture, including a criminal investigation into whether it misled the FAA over its 2017 certification of the 737 Max. A total of 346 people were killed in two 737 Max crashes in 2018 and 2019. As CNN reported over the weekend, the Justice Department is nearing an agreement with Boeing which would resolve potential criminal liability. In January, a door plug blew off of a 737 Max mid-flight, prompting a wave of intense scrutiny of the airplane manufacturer, including federal and congressional investigations. Boeing\u2019s CEO Dave Calhoun has announced he will step down by the end of this year. To address its safety issues, Boeing recently agreed to purchase supplier Spirit AeroSystems. Since January a number of whistleblowers have come forward with fresh allegations against Boeing. A current Boeing quality investigator, Sam Mohawk, also filed an official complaint last month reporting \u201ca number of non-compliant parts making their way back to the airplanes for installation.\u201d His complaint with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration was publicly released by a Senate subcommittee investigating Boeing. Mohawk\u2019s complaint said the issue of disappearing nonconforming parts continues.\u00a0\u201cBoeing is still losing parts to this day,\u201d his official complaint reads. A separate whistleblower, Richard Cuevas, last week made public his concerns that Boeing and its key supplier Spirit Aerosystems used compromised parts and made changes to \u201creduce bottlenecks in production and speed up production and delivery.\u201d Pulled from the scrapyard The pressure from Boeing management to keep assembly lines moving is no secret.\u00a0The 245-page House investigative report after the 737 Max fatal crashes dedicates an entire chapter to \u201cProduction Pressure.\u201d\u00a0After the January 5 door plug blowout on a 737 Max, the FAA capped\u00a0Boeing\u2019s production line speed. Meyers describes a pressure-packed environment at the Everett factory, where assembly teams competed with each other to find the parts they needed. Meyers alleges that after hours, workers would ask security guards to unlock doors and sneak parts out of supply rooms, or remove newly arrived components awaiting quality inspections by Meyers\u2019 team.\u00a0Similar parts destined for a different airplane model were ripe for the taking. At some point in the early 2000s, Boeing employees began also pulling parts from the company\u2019s scrapyard in Auburn, Washington, located about an hour south\u00a0of the nearly 100-acre factory building\u00a0where Dreamliners were assembled,\u00a0according to documentation\u00a0Meyers shared with CNN. Nonconforming parts end up in the reclamation yard, Meyers says, only after being\u00a0rejected by three departments:\u00a0Engineering, procurement, and quality. Meyers claims that by around 2002, employees at the reclamation yard became concerned that they would be considered responsible when scrap parts were later found on an aircraft.\u00a0So, they asked employees to sign for the removals \u2013 but their homemade form wasn\u2019t an official Boeing document, which meant the removal was never recorded in the company\u2019s quality management database. \u201cThese are bootleg forms that are not Boeing authorized,\u201d Meyers said.\u00a0\u201cThe procurement organization would go down to our scrap reclamation yard and intimidate the employees there and say we need these parts bad.\u201d Lack of enforcement Meyers says he repeatedly referred violations for investigation but found the company\u2019s efforts to look into them lacking. \u201cTheir investigations are about analyzing excuses by process violators, and not taking action against those committing compliance violations,\u201d Meyers wrote in a 2002 email to corporate HR at Boeing\u00a0. In its statement, Boeing said the quality team Meyers worked on \u201cplays an important role in identifying issues, improving processes, and strengthening compliance in our factories.\u201d \u201cWe appreciate employees who raise their voice and we have systems in place to encourage them to speak up confidentially or anonymously,\u201d the statement said. Meyers says his Boeing managers did not know how to handle employees who raised concerns, and said that after decades at the company he was ultimately given\u00a0a list of management grievances with his work, and offered a vague opportunity to improve \u2013 or take a cash payout and leave. \u201cI was given a list of things to correct \u2013 it was my behaviors and my practices as a manager,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cSo it looked like a personal improvement program \u2026 but it had a financial incentive with it \u2013 or you can take this money and quit.\u201d Meyers said he never intended to become a whistleblower but is now speaking with those who ask \u2013 including a Senate subcommittee probing Boeing \u2013 to generate momentum for change. \u201cHopefully we can get this company to heal and be what it was,\u201d he said.

Earlier this week, AI company ElevenLabs said it is bringing digitally produced celebrity voice-overs of deceased actors, including Garland, James Dean and Burt Reynolds, to its newly launched Reader app. The company said the app takes articles, PDF, ePub, newsletters, e-books or any other text on your phone and turns it into voice-overs.  \u201cWe deeply respect their legacy and are honored to have their voices as part of our platform,\u201d said Dustin Blank, head of partnerships at ElevenLabs. \u201cAdding them to our growing list of narrators marks a major step forward in our mission of making content accessible in any language and voice.\u201d The company said it made deals with the estates of the actors whose voices are being used, but did not share details about compensation. The effort shows the potential of artificial intelligence for Hollywood but also sets a precedent for licensing and working with estates. It also comes at a time when the technology has grown by leaps and bounds, particularly in its ability to create images, text and sound, making it easy for anyone to create a version of someone\u2019s voice saying something they never did. That, in turn, has raised questions in creative industries such as journalism and film about how artificial intelligence can \u2014 or even should \u2014 be used. ElevenLabs previously made headlines earlier this year when its tool was reportedly used to create a fake robocall from President Joe Biden urging people not to vote in New Hampshire\u2019s presidential primary. Copyright questions and authenticity The partnership with the stars\u2019 estates comes two months after ChatGPT-maker OpenAI came under fire after introducing a synthetic voice that was eerily similar to Scarlett Johansson\u2019s character in the film \u201cHer.\u201d Johansson said in a statement shared with CNN that she was \u201cshocked, angered and in disbelief\u201d that the company would use her likeliness likeness after she turned down a partnership opportunity with OpenAI. Although a person can\u2019t copyright their own voice, it\u2019s possible to copyright a recording, according to David Gunkel, a professor at the department of communications at Northern Illinois University who tracks AI in media and entertainment. The AI is trained on old recordings and those recordings are under copyright. \u201cElevenLabs\u2019 new partnerships are all well within the realm of what the law allows,\u201d he said. \u201cAn estate will get a considerable amount of money from licensing and agreements. It\u2019s not unlike a company negotiating a copyright deal to use a popular song by Queen in an ad. The record company also could in theory say no, no matter how much money they\u2019re offered.\u201d Bern Elliot, a vice president and analyst at market research firm Gartner, said AI models can now be trained on fewer audio recordings; very little is needed to capture tone, speech patterns and other elements, whether it\u2019s for a celebrity or an everyday person. \u201cThe bigger concern is determining what the owner of those recordings can or can\u2019t do to monetize the voice,\u201d he said. Media companies are also ramping up their use of AI for voiceovers. Last week, NBC announced it is bringing an AI-version version of famed sportscaster Al Michaels back to the Olympics this summer, in daily recaps on its Peacock streaming platform. An NBC spokesperson told CNN that Michaels is being compensated for his involvement. It\u2019s unclear, however, how AI versions of well-known voices will be received by mass audiences and if it will raise concerns around authenticity. \u201cWe don\u2019t know yet the supposed market for these types of things but you can already see with audiobooks that ones read by recognizable voices and celebrities are a hot commodity,\u201d Gunkel said. \u201cIf there\u2019s a way to have a celebrity do all kinds of content and not voice it themselves, that could open up the market even wider.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/tech/elevenlabs-ai-celebrity-voices/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_04_business_germany-blocks-vw-subsidiary-china", "text": "Germany has blocked the sale of a Volkswagen subsidiary to China on national security grounds, delivering a fresh blow to the already tense relationship with its biggest trading partner. MAN Energy Solutions, part of the Volkswagen Group, said in June 2023 that it planned to sell its gas turbines business to Chinese state-owned CSIC Longjiang GH Gas Turbine Co (GHGT). But a German government review, initiated in September, raised concerns that China might use the gas turbines to power warships, according to Reuters. The decision to block the deal comes just weeks after the European Union hiked tariffs on electric vehicles from China, sparking a trade dispute with Beijing, which days later launched an investigation into prices of EU pork. During a press conference Wednesday, Germany\u2019s economy minister Robert Habeck said that Berlin welcomes investments from foreign companies, but technologies relevant to \u201cpublic security\u201d must be protected from countries \u201cwhich maybe do not always have a friendly relationship with us.\u201d At the same press conference, Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said she welcomed the government\u2019s decision \u201cfor security reasons.\u201d Germany and China traded goods worth \u20ac255 billion ($275.3 billion) last year, according to German government figures. But Berlin\u2019s relationship with Beijing has come under strain in recent years, as Germany tries to protect local manufacturers and reduce its dependence on China. It was burned badly by its close economic ties with Russia after the invasion of Ukraine \u2014 in particular a heavy reliance on Russian natural gas \u2014 and wants to reduce the risks of something similar happening in future. In November 2022, Germany blocked the sale of one of its semiconductor factories to a Chinese-owned tech company, also citing security concerns. A spokesperson for China\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Thursday that China opposes the \u201cpoliticization\u201d of \u201cnormal commercial cooperation.\u201d \u201cWe hope that Germany will provide a fair, just and non-discriminatory business environment for companies from all over the world, including Chinese companies.\u201d MAN Energy Solutions said it respected the government\u2019s decision. \u201c(We) will now initiate a structured process to close-down the gas turbine division, which will take place over the coming months,\u201d the company added in a statement shared with CNN. The additional EU tariffs, which could add as much as 38% to the cost of importing an electric car from China, will take effect from Friday for an initial period of four months. The EU must decide by November whether to adopt the tariffs for five years. In a statement Thursday, the European Commission said that \u201cconsultations with the Chinese government have intensified in recent weeks,\u201d with a view to resolving the dispute. Volkswagen, Europe\u2019s biggest carmaker, reiterated earlier comments that the timing of the EU decision is \u201cdetrimental to the current weak demand\u201d for EVs in Germany and the region. \u201cThe negative effects of this decision outweigh any potential benefits for the European and especially the German automotive industry,\u201d the company added in a statement.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/business/germany-blocks-vw-subsidiary-china/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_04_24_tech_nokia-moon-4g-network-nasa-spc", "text": "Texting on the Moon? Streaming on Mars? It may not be as far away as you think. That\u2019s the shared vision of NASA and Nokia, who have partnered to set up a cellular network on the Moon to help lay the building blocks for long-term human presence on other planets. A SpaceX rocket is due to launch this year \u2014 the exact date has yet to be confirmed \u2014 carrying a simple 4G network to the Moon. The lander will install the system at the Moon\u2019s south pole and then it will be remotely controlled from Earth. \u201cThe first challenge to getting a network up and running is having a space-qualified cellular equipment that meets the appropriate size, weight, and power requirements, as well as being deployed without a technician,\u201d Walt Engelund, deputy associate administrator for programs at NASA\u2019s Space Technology Mission Directorate, told CNN. No less of a challenge, it will need to operate in the harsh lunar environment of extreme temperatures and radiation. The 4G network unit is being built by Nokia\u2019s Bell Labs using a range of off-the-shelf commercial components. It will be loaded onto a lander made by US company Intuitive Machines, and once deployed it will connect the lander via radio equipment to two roaming vehicles with their own special mission: to search for ice. One of the vehicles, the Lunar Outpost rover, will explore the area known as Shackleton Connecting Ridge, while the other, the Micro-Nova hopper, will plunge into a crater to scan for unprecedented up-close evidence of Moon ice. Images of ice \u2014 transmitted back to the lander and then Earth in near real-time via the cellular network \u2014 would be a world-first. Lunar ice could be used to create breathable oxygen, and even fuel that could eventually be used to launch Mars missions from the Moon. For NASA\u2019s Artemis program, which aims to return astronauts to the moon this decade, cellular connectivity is invaluable. Currently, astronauts talk to each other by radio, but NASA wants a lunar communications system capable of supporting high-resolution video and science data, said Engelund \u2014 especially as Artemis missions become more sophisticated. \u201cBeing able to communicate on the Moon is critical to Artemis \u2014 as critical as any other mission element like power, water to drink, and air to breathe,\u201d said Engelund. \u201cEventually, this effort will help establish a lunar communications network that could give our explorers the ability to beam scientific data back, confer with mission control, and talk to their families, as if they were walking down the street on their cellphones.\u201d It could lay the groundwork for an off-world internet not dissimilar to that of Earth\u2019s. Personal devices could connect to such networks, allowing \ufeffspace colonists to use smartphones that can access all the apps and services available to those back on Earth. NASA selected Bell Labs as part of its Tipping Point initiative, a series of partnerships with companies to develop technologies for future missions that puts them in prime position for key roles in the future space economy. Bell Labs was given a $14.1 million grant in 2020, and in January, Nokia was selected by the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to begin working on a communications services infrastructure that will eventually serve as the \u201cframework for the lunar economy.\u201d \u201cA future lunar economy will critically depend on communication technologies to collect and analyze data, share information, and maintain and control operations,\u201d Thierry Klein, president of Bell Labs Solutions Research, told CNN. \u201cThis includes sustaining a semi-permanent or permanent human presence on the Moon, as well as automated robotic operations for transportation, resource mining, mineral processing and scientific data collection.\u201d There are potential commercial benefits for Earthly business ventures too. If a network can withstand the journey into orbit, then deploy and endure autonomously amid the vacuum of space, wildly fluctuating temperatures and cosmic radiation, it will be able to survive the harshest locations on Earth \u2014 such as polar ice caps, deserts, or offshore platforms. \u201cEspecially when it comes to remote deployments, industrial sites, public safety, emergency response, disaster recovery or defense, it is highly beneficial to have compact, low-footprint network equipment that can be easily transported and deployed anywhere,\u201d Klein said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/24/tech/nokia-moon-4g-network-nasa-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_01_tech_aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl", "text": "A London-based technology company is looking to \u201cdemocratize\u201d talent-identification and scouting in soccer using a mobile app. Free to download and available globally, the aiScout app allows aspiring soccer stars to enter virtual trials for professional clubs by uploading self-recorded footage of themselves completing a series of drills. It offers 75 exercises, designed to test a range of skills, with videos showing users how to complete them. Performances are automatically scored by artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The data can then be accessed by clubs, allowing their scouts to peruse scores for viable talent, honing their search with a variety of filters; from age and gender to position on the pitch. The app currently has two English Premier League (EPL) partners, Chelsea and Burnley, and clubs can tailor their in-app trials to meet specific needs and set their own benchmarks by having their academy players complete the same drills. \u201cWe\u2019re putting that data up front to make better use of [the scouts\u2019] time,\u201d said Richard Felton-Thomas, chief operating officer of ai.io, the company behind the app. \u201cTo say [to scouts], \u2018Go over to this place today because there\u2019s three players in that game that are all actually beating your Chelsea standard\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s going to be the best use of your time.\u2019\u201d It already appears to be working for some. Ben Greenwood had never had a trial with a professional club until he downloaded the app in 2019. After uploading footage of himself, the 17-year-old landed a trial with Chelsea, becoming the first user of the app to get a trial with a pro club. He signed a contract\u00a0with EPL team Bournemouth\u00a0in 2021. \u2018It\u2019s more about evolution\u2019 Having beta-tested in with players spanning 125 countries, Greenwood among them, 135 players have been trialed or signed by pro clubs or national teams through the app \u2014 which fully launched in September 2023 \u2014 according to Felton-Thomas. Just over 100,000 players make up the current database, but with over 100 clubs lined up to join Chelsea and Burnley, as well as a multi-year partnership with Major League Soccer in the US announced last May, Felton-Thomas projects user numbers to surge into the millions as the operation ramps up this year. Felton-Thomas said the \u201clion\u2019s share\u201d of its income comes from charging clubs a license fee to run the platform. Annual fees vary depending on the size of the club and the tools they require, ranging from six figures for \u201ctier one\u201d sides like Chelsea, to thousands of pounds for clubs lower down the footballing pyramid. The use of smart technology in sport continues to expand, including\u00a0AI commentary tools and wearable tech for elite athletes. The global market for sports analytics, valued at\u00a0$2.7 billion\u00a0in 2023, is projected to grow 22% by the end of the decade, according to market research firm Grand View Research. Should soccer talent scouts be concerned about being edged out by the arrival of AI in their industry? For Felton-Thomas, new technologies can co-exist with traditional methods. \u201cIt\u2019s more about evolution than revolution,\u201d Felton-Thomas explained. \u201cWe can\u2019t tell you when that player\u2019s actually in that match, how does he deal with adversity? What happens when he\u2019s 2-0 down? What happens when someone\u2019s shouting at him? What happens when he\u2019s just made a massive mistake?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got the ability to just augment real people to do their jobs better and faster, which then gives an opportunity to the player through the AI, but you\u2019re still actually just connecting them to the human on the other side, which is the club and the scout.\u201d While football remains ai.io\u2019s primary focus, the company is looking into opportunities in other sports to launch in the coming years. Further ahead, it may branch out beyond sports. \u201cYou think about the notion that you can be at home and analyze your movements, and how this could spin into health care, physical assessments for military disciplines and emergency services,\u201d Felton-Thomas told CNN.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/01/tech/aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_29_business_nathans-famous-competitive-eating-hot-dogs", "text": "Every Fourth of July, starting when she was 15, Jacqueline Lewis and her family come together to honor a great American tradition: the Nathan\u2019s Famous hot dog eating competition. \u201cI think people want to know how many hot dogs a human can eat in that amount of time.\u201d Lewis, now 26, told CNN on a warm June day while eating miniature corn dogs (at a leisurely pace) outside of the original Nathan\u2019s location in Coney Island. \u201cI think they want to know.\u201d Lewis and her family aren\u2019t the only ones who want to see how many franks competitors can scarf down in 10 minutes. Each year, close to two million people watch Nathan\u2019s hot dog eating contest on ESPN, according to the frankfurter brand. Tens of thousands of spectators come out to Brooklyn\u2019s Coney Island to watch the event in person. Competitors train for months in advance, preparing their bodies to consume thousands of calories in just a few minutes. When it was announced recently that reigning champion Joey Chestnut was barred from competing this year over his deal with Impossible Foods \u2013 a plant-based meat company \u2013 it made national headlines. Nathan\u2019s, and the marketing visionaries behind the annual event, helped shape competitive eating as we know it today: a bombastic, showy sport that some say symbolizes America\u2019s obsession with excess. But eating contests date back. Way back. Two men, many ginger cakes It seems like people have always had a fascination with how much someone can eat and how quickly. \u201cSpeed and volume competitions pop up in Greek myth, in the Eddas of Norse myth, and even in what may be mankind\u2019s first novel, Apuleius\u2019 \u2018Golden Ass,\u2019 written in the second century A.D.,\u201d wrote Jason Fagone in his book \u201cHorsemen of the Esophagus: Competitive Eating and the Big Fat American Dream.\u201d In the United States, the tradition goes back a few hundred years. Fagone cites a 1793 Pennsylvania newspaper that described an event in which two men \u201cundertook to eat twenty-four ginger cakes each.\u201d Over time, pie eating contests became a regular part of Fourth of July celebrations as well as \u201ca natural icebreaker for picnics, summer camps, and county fairs,\u201d Fagone wrote. In the 19th century, there were basically two kinds of contests, explained Adrienne Bitar, a lecturer in American studies at Cornell University and the author of \u201cDiet and the Disease of Civilization.\u201d There was speed eating \u2014\u00a0who could eat the most in a set amount of time \u2014\u00a0and untimed competitions, where the winner was the person who could eat the most, full stop. The foods back then were simpler, and unbranded. People competed over onions, eggs, watermelon and pies. The contests were \u201cvery lighthearted,\u201d she said, and not nearly as physically taxing as they are today \u2014 they were \u201cathletic like a three legged race is athletic.\u201d When Nathan\u2019s starting putting on its annual event in the 1970s, it looked more like those early contests. At the time, PR mavens Max Rosey and Mortimer Matz thought a hot dog eating competition would drum up some publicity for Nathan\u2019s. (They also seem to have made up the legend that the first Nathan\u2019s contest was held in 1916). Back then, \u201cthere was still kind of like a local flavor to it \u2026 the competitors were mostly just big guys from Long Island,\u201d Fagone told CNN. Contestants would enter, rapidly eat some hot dogs and go back home to their own barbecues, he said. Melody Andorfer was the winner of the first official Nathan\u2019s contest in 1972, according to the Coney Island History Project. She ate 12 hot dogs in 5 minutes \u2014 beating all other competitors, men and women, she told the non-profit in an interview in 2020. That first year, Nathan\u2019s used barrels and a plank of wood to make the competitors table, she recalled. \u201cThey put a white plastic tablecloth there. In front of you, they put on a paper plate hot dogs and no mustard, nothing to drink. Just the hot dogs.\u201d A couple of decades later, in the 1990s, brothers George and Richard Shea took over marketing for Nathan\u2019s. George Shea, who still hosts the competition, helped turn the homespun event into a gigantic spectacle. Hot dog publicity Americans say the annual competition is about many things: Coney Island, the Fourth of July, patriotism \u2014 but the event that kicked off the rise of mainstream competitive eating in the United States is, at its core, about publicity, the man who runs the contest said. \u201cIt is a sport that did not start as a sport. It was a platform for exposure for Nathan\u2019s and certainly many other brands in the years that followed,\u201d said George Shea, who co-founded Major League Eating, the professional league that now oversees the competition. Shea took over the contest in 1991 when Rosey died. Before Shea stepped in, he said, the contests included a couple of cameras, a handful of competitors and \u201c15 or 20 onlookers who just happened to be passersby and stopped.\u201d As host, Shea cultivated a persona designed to hype the event. He stands on stage in a flat-top straw hat and a suit and tie. Leading up to the contest, he makes grand proclamations about life and poetry as dramatic music plays. When announcing competitors, he builds up anticipation, treating the event more like a boxing match than a hot dog eating contest. The act is \u201ca little bit of Coney Island, it\u2019s a little bit of sports reporter, it\u2019s a little bit of apocalyptic preacher,\u201d Shea said. \u201cThe whole thing is just fantastic. You get up there, there are no rules, you say and do whatever you want and it\u2019s all about getting in motion, expressing the emotion \u2026 and universally the reaction I get from people is just \u2018this is not what I expected and I really love it,\u2019\u201d Shea said. It took a while to bring that performance to the mainstream. About a decade into his tenure as leader of the competition, Shea pitched a story to the LA Times. The ensuing article introduced the idea to a new part of the country, he said. After that, Shea signed deals for a documentary and TV special \u2014 just as superstar Takeru Kobayashi came onto the scene in 2001 and \u201cblew it open,\u201d Shea said. \u201cIt was coincidental and very mutually beneficial \u2014 the timing was very good because he had enormous star power,\u201d Shea said. The first year he participated in the contest, Kobayashi ate 50 hot dogs \u2014\u00a0nearly double the 2000 winner. Kobayashi showed \u201cthat you could treat (the contest) as an athletic activity and excel,\u201d Fagone said. The Japanese newcomer had taken the pursuit seriously, training and coming up with a novel way to approach the contest (separate hot dogs from buns and snap the frankfurters in half before eating). The intensity of the training, and the achievement, lent legitimacy to the whole endeavor. A few years later, ESPN started broadcasting the event. An American tradition, for better or worse For some, competitive eating is a symbol of American culture \u2014 the good and the bad. Eating contests are \u201ca celebration of excess,\u201d Bitar said, part and parcel of the myth of America that attracted immigrants when the country was still young. They represent \u201cthis larger fantasy, this national American fairy tale about consuming without consequence.\u201d Kobayashi himself has pierced that fantasy, revealing in a Netflix documentary show called \u201cHack Your Health\u201d that he no longer feels hunger and that he\u2019s worried competitive eating may have lasting ramifications for his health. (Nevertheless, he plans to compete against Chestnut in an upcoming Netflix special). The contests have staying power in part because of their shock value, Bitar said. Competitive eating \u201cbreaks all sorts of etiquette and social norms,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of these moments where all of our rules are broken.\u201d Shea also pointed to an underlying tension as a reason that Americans still watch the Nathan\u2019s hot dog eating contest after all these years. He described it as the \u201celement of \u2018wait you\u2019re not supposed to do that\u2019 and \u2018I can\u2019t believe he\u2019s doing that or she\u2019s doing that.\u2019\u201d But he sees the contest as a special event, one that symbolizes something else: happiness. \u201cIt goes to New York City history \u2026 but more important, hot dogs represent to me the joy of summer.\u201d Beatrice Fellman, 25, agrees. The Coney Island visitor, who described the hot dog as \u201cAmerica\u2019s meal\u201d on that warm day in June, said it stands for \u201cpatriotism and a good time.\u201d Fellman was one of many on a crowded boardwalk, flooded with hundreds of beachgoers trying to soak up the sun, carrying towels and beach chairs. The mood was celebratory. Bass bumped from speakers and a live band played to about a dozen people dancing. Despite the heat, there were lines at both Nathan\u2019s locations, where people waited for the famous hot dogs and crinkle-cut french fries. \u201cWe love the Nathan\u2019s hot dog eating competition because we love how it brings the city together,\u201d Fellman said, standing with a group of her friends, all wearing Nathan\u2019s hot dog eating contest T-shirts. \u201cIt celebrates a beautiful American comfort food that is the hot dog.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/29/business/nathans-famous-competitive-eating-hot-dogs/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_30_business_boeing-plea-deal", "text": "The US Justice Department is nearing an agreement with Boeing that would include a corporate monitor and a fine in exchange for a guilty plea to criminal charges, according to lawyers representing the families of victims of two fatal 737 Max crashes, who harshly rebuked the offer as a \u201csweetheart deal.\u201d The criminal charges and potential plea deal come after repeated safety failures at Boeing that have resulted in multiple federal investigations and a sharp rebuke from airlines, customers, lawmakers and regulators. Criminal charges against a major corporation like Boeing are rare and would represent a serious blow to the company\u2019s already\u00a0precarious financial situation\u00a0and further damage its\u00a0battered reputation. But the victims\u2019 families said they were furious that Boeing may avoid trial, saying the government is letting the company off the hook for the deaths of their loved ones. \u201cI can tell you that the families are very unhappy and angered with DOJ\u2019s decisions and proposal,\u201d said Robert Clifford, lead counsel in the civil litigation against Boeing, in a statement. \u201cThere is no accountability, no admission that Boeing\u2019s admitted crime caused the 346 deaths, and the families will most certainly object before Judge Reed O\u2019Connor and ask that he reject the plea if Boeing accepts.\u201d Clifford and Paul Cassell represent many family members of the 2018 Lion Air crash and\u00a02019 Ethiopian Air crash\u00a0victims of Boeing 737 Max jets. They and some of the families they represent were briefed by the Justice Department Sunday about the plea deal. The deal would include three years of probation, a \u201csmall\u201d fine and and a monitor to ensure safety compliance, Cassell told CNN. Other specific terms of the proposed offer were not immediately known, and CNN has not reviewed the proposal first-hand. Bloomberg first reported the potential plea deal Sunday. Boeing declined to comment, and the Department of Justice did not respond to a request for comment. Violating Boeing\u2019s previous agreement Last month, the Justice Department notified Boeing that its recent string of safety failures and production problems constituted a breach of the terms of\u00a0its\u00a02021 agreement in which the company avoided criminal charges for two fatal 737 Max crashes. A\u00a0door plug blew off an Alaska Airlines flight\u00a0shortly after takeoff in January, and the investigations that followed revealed a series of quality errors and safety gaps. As a result, the Department of Justice said Boeing is subject to criminal prosecution, but it has not publicly announced its decision about whether it will prosecute the case. Last week, prosecutors urged the Justice Department to file criminal charges. Boeing will have by the end of the week to determine whether to accept the plea deal or go to trial. The deadline for the Justice Department to file criminal charges in the case is July 7. Cassell said the families were upset that the Justice Department deal excluded the prosecution of individuals at Boeing. \u201cThe deal will not acknowledge, in any way, that Boeing\u2019s crime killed 346 people.\u00a0It also appears to rest on the idea that Boeing did not harm any victim,\u201d Cassell said in a statement. Although the Justice Department acknowledged the families\u2019 strong desire to take Boeing\u2019s criminal case to trial, the families\u2019 lawyers said the Department of Justice feared it would be unable to prove the charges beyond a reasonable doubt \u2014 the higher standard of proof necessary for a conviction in a criminal trial. A broken safety culture More than a dozen whistleblowers have come forward against Boeing in recent years, and the number has grown substantially since the\u00a0door plug incident in January. Last week, for example, a whistleblower from a contractor for Spirit Aerosystems, a Boeing manufacturing partner, said he notified the company of wide gaps in a key part of 787 Dreamliner planes that posed \u201ccatastrophic\u201d danger to passengers. As part of its plan to shore up its safety program, Boeing said it was looking to repurchase Spirit to bring manufacturing of its planes fully in house. Boeing spun off Spirit in 2005. Boeing and Spirit reportedly came to terms on a deal Sunday, according to Reuters, but the deal has not been publicly disclosed and Boeing declined to comment to CNN. The Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board have opened multiple investigations into Boeing because of its ongoing quality and safety failures. The FAA has said a\u00a0six-week audit of Boeing\u2019s facilities\u00a0conducted in the late winter found multiple problems with Boeing\u2019s production practices. A separate\u00a0report\u00a0found \u201cgaps\u201d in Boeing\u2019s safety culture, including a disconnect between management and employees, and fears among employees about retaliation for reporting safety concerns. Boeing\u2019s CEO Dave Calhoun earlier this month\u00a0apologized for Boeing\u2019s recent safety failures\u00a0in testimony delivered to a Senate committee but pushed back on claims the company retaliated against those who brought safety issues to light. Calhoun said Boeing is \u201cfar from perfect,\u201d and acknowledged the company will not easily regain the public\u2019s trust.

{"id": "2024_07_02_media_biden-mental-fitness", "text": "President Joe Biden\u2019s White House repeatedly and aggressively shot down reports\u00a0on\u00a0the president\u2019s age and any possible limitations\u00a0on his ability to perform all the duties of his office. But after his shaky debate performance last week, in which Biden routinely struggled to\u00a0get his point across, some in the White House press corps say they wish they had pushed harder to tell the story. In June, when the Wall Street Journal published a\u00a0lengthy piece\u00a0on President Joe Biden\u2019s mental\u00a0state, the newspaper\u00a0got\u00a0slammed.\u00a0The White House, its allies, and\u00a0some in the media\u00a0\u2013\u00a0including CNN\u2019s Reliable Sources\u00a0\u2013\u00a0criticized the Journal for quoting mostly Republican political foes on the record, who had a clear political motive to damage Biden\u2019s image. No Democrats were quoted on the record making those allegations, and several Democrats complained their on-the-record quotes praising Biden\u2019s sharpness were not included. The\u00a0Journal defended its reporting at the time. Last week\u2019s debate on CNN laid bare many of the concerns the Journal\u2019s reporting had raised \u2013 that the president has good days and bad days but can sometimes seem to slip up. A New York Times report on Tuesday raised similar concerns by those who have recently been in the room with Biden. The Times reported Biden has more frequent \u201clapses,\u201d although at other times he appears sharp. After Biden\u2019s lackluster performance last week, some are questioning whether the White House press corps dropped the ball on fully covering Biden\u2019s limitations. Biden\u2019s\u00a0age issue is not secret or new. Nearly every media outlet has reported on\u00a0growing concerns about\u00a0Biden\u2019s age well before the debate. The White House in the past has complained that the coverage is disproportionate, and that the media is spending more time covering Biden\u2019s age than his accomplishments as president versus former President Donald Trump\u2019s lies. The media has faced accusations that it has not covered Biden\u2019s mental fitness more aggressively because it wants to prop up the campaign in some way \u2013 an accusation the White House reporters CNN spoke to denied. Several White House reporters\u00a0told CNN that\u00a0the\u00a0coverage\u00a0of Biden\u2019s age and his mental stamina\u00a0should have\u00a0pushed harder. They cited several difficulties in doing so before the debate \u2013 from the obvious political motivations of sources who either want to protect Biden\u2019s image or project a certain image, to the blowback from pursuing such reports, especially from the White House and Democrats. A difficult task Like all past presidents, Biden has good days and bad days. It\u00a0can be tricky to report on something as difficult to define as a person aging, when his opponent\u00a0is a convicted felon, who regularly lies and has threatened to use the government to go after his political opponents. Still, some reporters said the press corps\u00a0could\u00a0have done a better job\u00a0covering\u00a0Biden\u2019s physical and mental state. The failure of the media, one White House reporter said,\u00a0was\u00a0not\u00a0pushing more aggressively\u00a0into Biden\u2019s abilities after the release of the Robert Hurr report in February, which called Biden a \u201cwell-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.\u201d Biden\u2019s age was also a right-wing talking point for years, something the White House was quick to point out to reporters,\u00a0which\u00a0may have inadvertently turned off any serious investigation. For example, deceptively edited clips of Biden from the G7 spread widely by right-wing media figures were made to seem as though he was aimlessly \u201cwandering off\u201d from fellow world leaders when really, he was speaking to parachutists who had just landed during a demonstration. \u201cThe right-wing media was calling him senile from day one, and that wasn\u2019t true,\u201d the reporter said. \u201cThen whenever you report on the age you were in some ways solidifying, giving credence to some people that were actually of bad faith.\u201d All the White House reporters who spoke to CNN for this piece chose to speak anonymously so they could speak more freely about their relationship with the White House. Keeping the president at a distance Reporters said the White House has not made the press corps\u2019 job easy:\u00a0The White House has put up guardrails around Biden, they say, and\u00a0he does not engage in as many interviews or planned press conferences\u00a0as previous presidents. At those events,\u00a0the press might be able to gauge how he\u2019s doing on the spot, without prepared remarks. \u201cThey keep him at arm\u2019s length, and he rarely does extended interviews,\u201d the reporter said of the White House,\u00a0although he acknowledged Biden has started giving more interviews as of late. Biden has done fewer interviews and formal press conferences than his most recent predecessors, according to data compiled by\u00a0Martha Joynt Kumar,\u00a0professor emerita of political science at Towson University who chronicles the presidents\u2019 interactions with the press. But on quick and informal interactions with the press, like shouted questions on the way to his helicopter or plane, Biden\u00a0as of this week has had 588 interactions, Kumar reports, second only to Trump when compared to recent presidents. But those interactions are not the same as an extended press conference, reporters noted. On Tuesday, ABC News announced Biden would sit down with George Stephanopoulos for an interview, his first since the debate. The White House press shop has also been very \u201caggressive\u201d and \u201cfairly successful\u201d in mitigating coverage of concerns over the president\u2019s age,\u00a0said\u00a0another White House reporter who works for a different publication. \u201c[B]erating reporters who bring them reporting about age concerns, bemoaning that it\u2019s all anyone writes about (clearly, it\u2019s not) and often attacking pieces after they run,\u201d the reporter told CNN. \u201cI think that\u2019s left some folks to conclude that these stories are too painful to report or that they should pick their spots more. It\u2019s clear the age stories that have angered the White House (and the liberal Twittersphere) the most.\u201d Alex Thompson, a White House reporter for Axios, said on CNN the day after the debate that \u201cthe White House\u2019s response every single time\u00a0it\u00a0has come up for three-and-a-half years has been to deflect, to gaslight, to not tell the truth \u2013 not just to reporters, not just to other Democrats, but even at times to themselves about the president\u2019s limitations at his age.\u201d Still, this White House\u2019s recent conduct with reporters pales in comparison to Trump\u2019s team, which has done everything from revoking press access to reporters they disagree with, to calling reporters the \u201cenemy of the people.\u201d The White House declined to comment. Aging doesn\u2019t happen all at once Aging is also not a sudden moment.\u00a0That makes it trickier to report on. \u201cTo some extent, the decline has appeared to be gradual \u2014 hard to notice from day to day \u2014 and that\u2019s perhaps made it harder for reporters to determine when is the right moment to write something,\u201d one of the reporters said. Just a few days before the debate, Biden held a press conference at the G7 alongside Ukrainian President Vlodomyr Zelensky that passed off without anything of note in Biden\u2019s demeanor. But reporters pointed out (and have published stories noting) that the president has been using teleprompters at most big events, even fundraisers where in the past he might not have. He has also started to use the lower stairs to board Air Force One. Last year, The New York Times published a lengthy piece on the \u201ccomplicated reality of America\u2019s oldest president,\u201d which looked at some of those accommodations and concerns for his age, but also the moments where he showed stamina and vigor. Some reporters said that there has been a distinct change\u00a0within the last year, and that the press corps should have reported more aggressively on the accommodations made for the president. \u201cI think the press, most of the White House press, did suffer from a bit of lack of curiosity,\u201d one of the reporters said. Look who you\u2019re up against Biden\u2019s allies will often question coverage of the president\u2019s age, questioning why reporters focus on the president\u2019s age and mental lucidity and not on Trump\u2019s\u00a0\u2013\u00a0who, at 78,\u00a0was observed falling asleep during his hush money trial, has made his own major verbal flubs and bizarre statements, and regularly spouts complete falsehoods. \u201cIt makes sense to reflect on this now and ask whether we missed or, really, under-reported the story of Biden\u2019s age and decline. But it\u2019s complicated,\u201d one of the reporters said. \u201cThe fact that the political alternative to Biden is an authoritarian who sparked an insurrection and is a convicted felon does not mean that the press is failing American democracy to focus on Biden\u2019s obvious frailty.\u201d One of the reporters said the media can, and do, report on both. Biden\u2019s allies, however, say too much attention is placed on Biden\u2019s age and not on the threat Trump could pose to American democracy. But the reporters say they can, and should, do both. \u201cJust because you are reporting on Biden age, doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not reporting on Trump\u2019s lies.\u00a0 I find that argument silly, and it seems one design towards like producing a certain outcome in the election, rather than like an honest reporting,\u201d one of the reporters said. The outlets that had received harsh blowback for their previous reports on Biden\u2019s lucidity now feel justified. A source familiar with the staff behind the Wall Street Journal\u2019s report said that when the piece first published, the reporters were approached by people with sympathy asking how they\u2019re doing \u201cas if something terrible had just happened,\u201d the source said. After the debate, the reporters started to get messages saying they were right.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/media/biden-mental-fitness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "business"}}

Shares of the tech behemoth rose 2.1% to an all-time high close of $377.44 on Monday, beating the previous record of $376.17. That comes after shares of Microsoft fell 1.7% on Friday, when Sam Altman was ousted from his position at OpenAI in a boardroom coup. Microsoft is the artificial intelligence firm\u2019s biggest stakeholder, with a $13 billion investment in the company. Greg Brockman, who co-founded OpenAI and quit after Altman\u2019s firing, is also joining Microsoft. Altman\u2019s hiring ended days of speculation that the former chief executive could return to the firm after his dramatic firing. Emmett Shear, former CEO of Amazon-owned streaming service Twitch, will replace OpenAI chief technology officer Mira Murati as interim chief executive. Microsoft shares are up about 56% for the year. The stock is one of the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d that have powered the lion\u2019s share of the market\u2019s returns this year, boosted by Wall Street\u2019s bet that artificial intelligence is the next big thing in tech.

{"id": "2024_07_01_tech_meta-eu-competition-rules", "text": "Facebook parent Meta has been accused of breaking Europe\u2019s new digital competition rules over its \u201cpay or consent\u201d advertising model. Late last year, Meta (META)\u00a0launched\u00a0a service called \u201cSubscription for no ads,\u201d allowing European users of Facebook and Instagram to pay up to \u20ac12.99 ($14) a month for ad-free versions. The alternative is to accept versions with personalized ads. The European Commission said in a statement Monday that, in its preliminary view, \u201cthis binary choice forces users to consent to the (use) of their personal data and fails to provide them a less personalized but equivalent version of Meta\u2019s social networks.\u201d If the provisional findings of the Commission\u2019s investigation are confirmed, the EU could hit Meta with a fine equivalent to 10% of its global annual revenue under its landmark Digital Markets Act. Based on the company\u2019s 2023 results, that would amount to $13.5 billion. Meta said it didn\u2019t accept the Commission\u2019s findings. \u201c\u2019Subscription for no ads\u2019 follows the direction of the highest court in Europe and complies with the DMA,\u201d a spokesperson told CNN. \u201cWe look forward to further constructive dialogue with the European Commission to bring this investigation to a close.\u201d The EU announcement comes a week after the Commission accused Apple (AAPL) of breaching the DMA by preventing app developers from freely directing consumers to cheaper services. The regulators are also investigating Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) under the new law. The DMA, which came into force in March, requires dominant online platforms \u2014 so-called gatekeepers \u2014 to give users more choice, and rivals more opportunities to compete. Online platforms often collect personal data across their own and third-party services and use it in digital advertising services. Margrethe Vestager, a European Commissioner in charge of competition policy, noted in Monday\u2019s statement that Meta had been accumulating personal data of \u201cmillions of EU citizens over many years.\u201d \u201cWe want to empower citizens to be able to take control over their own data and choose a less personalized ads experience,\u201d she said. Michael Koenig, a senior official at the Commission, said Meta must offer users an alternative to \u201cfull\u201d ad personalization that \u201cdoes not rely on this personal data and which is then automatically less personalized and still available to them.\u201d \u201cThen Meta is free to keep a third option, which is a subscription not to see ads at all, or a fourth option which may have some premium features,\u201d he told journalists.

{"id": "2024_07_05_business_saks-fifth-avenue-neiman-marcus-amazon", "text": "Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus are merging to create a luxury department store empire. And Amazon wants to help. Saks owner HBC announced a deal Thursday to acquire Neiman Marcus for $2.65 billion, establishing a luxury behemoth called Saks Global that has the two namesake department stores plus Saks Off 5th discount store and the upscale Bergdorf Goodman. \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to take this step in bringing together these iconic luxury names, Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman,\u201d said HBC CEO Richard Baker in a release. The two companies have been linked to merger talks for years, and the deal gives them more leverage to negotiate with luxury brands for lower costs. Saks has 39 stores, while Neiman Marcus, which filed for bankruptcy in 2020, has 36 stores. Neiman Marcus also owns Bergdorf Goodman. Several leadership changes were also announced. Current Saks.com CEO Marc Metrick will become the CEO for the Saks Global business. Current HBC Properties and Investments CEO Ian Putnam will become CEO of Saks Global\u2019s property and investments business. Both of them will report to Baker, who becomes the executive chairman of Saks Global. The merger means that HBC\u2019s Canadian business, which includes Hudson\u2019s Bay department stores and $2 billion in property across the country, will operate separately from Saks Global. The unit \u201cwill be well positioned to support future growth, while continuing to serve its loyal Canadian base,\u201d the release said. The chains are responding to industry shifts, including the decline of department stores, and the growing power of luxury brands. Brands such as Louis Vuitton parent LVMH are getting bigger and shifting their distribution strategy to direct-to-consumer sales, away from department stores. The planned Saks-Neiman Marcus merger seeks to wrest back some control. It also comes on the heels of Coach parent Tapestry\u2019s proposal to buy Michael Kors owner Capri. \u201cAs a larger entity, negotiating power will be a little better with the brands, but even a combined chain would not match the heft and power of the global luxury conglomerates, which would still hold most of the card,\u201d Neil Saunders, an analyst at GlobalData Retail, said in a note to clients Wednesday. Saks\u2019 deal could face regulatory scrutiny, however. The Federal Trade Commission sued to block Tapestry\u2019s merger with Capri, saying it would harm competition. \u201cThe proposed merger threatens to deprive millions of American consumers of the benefits of Tapestry and\u00a0Capri\u2019s head-to-head competition, which includes competition on price, discounts and promotions, innovation, design,\u00a0marketing and advertising,\u201d the FTC said. Amazon also is investing in the merger, working with Saks Global to \u201cinnovate on behalf of customers and brands partners following the close of the transaction,\u201d the release said. Amazon has tried to grow in physical retail. In 2022, it opened Amazon Style clothing stores in Glendale, California, and Columbus, Ohio, but closed them last year. Saunders added that Amazon\u2019s stake does \u201cmake sense, as it has ambitions to play more heavily in the luxury space and this would give it a toehold.\u201d \u201cHowever, the real win here would be the ability of Amazon to streamline logistics and e-commerce, giving the new entity an advantage in a market where remote shopping has become more important to shoppers \u2014 especially younger ones, which both chains need to do more to attract,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/business/saks-fifth-avenue-neiman-marcus-amazon/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_29_business_india-adani-slum-redevelopment-concerns-intl-hnk-dst", "text": "When Masoom Ali Shaikh arrived in Mumbai in 1974 as a young man from northern India, the patch of land where he set up shop was \u201cjust a creek with no proper road and garbage all around,\u201d he said. Fifty years later, that swampy area \u2014 once a fishing village and rubbish dump \u2014 is now Dharavi, one of Asia\u2019s biggest slums and a bustling hub of industry in India\u2019s financial capital. Famously depicted in the 2008 Oscar-winning film \u201cSlumdog Millionaire,\u201d Dharavi is a\u00a0cacophonous maze of small businesses on every corner, from bakeries to butchers to barbers. These shops service roughly one million residents living cheek by jowl in cramped buildings and narrow alleys. Many of them are migrants and artisans who brought the crafts of their home states to establish businesses in the sprawling 500-acre slum. These small-scale enterprises, which generate a collective annual turnover of more than $1 billion by some estimates, are a crucial source of livelihood for many families, some of whom have lived in Dharavi for generations. Shaikh is one of them. After arriving in Dharavi from his home state Uttar Pradesh, he set up a shoe-making business which allowed him to support six family members over the years, even opening a second shoe store for his daughter to operate. However, many residents fear their livelihoods could now be at risk as the slum prepares to undergo a drastic transformation, overseen by one of Asia\u2019s richest men. Over the decades, there have been several failed attempts to redevelop Dharavi, a process which experts say has always been politically fraught for several reasons: the sheer scale and density of the slum and the high value of its land in central Mumbai, for starters. Residents and authorities point to the slum\u2019s myriad problems, including extreme crowdedness and poor sanitation. Many residents have no access to running water or clean toilets and suffer from various health problems. In some poorly ventilated areas, dust perpetually hangs in the air and smoke wafts from nearby workshops. That could change with this newest plan, led by billionaire and infrastructure tycoon Gautam Adani, founder of the Adani Group, who briefly ousted Jeff Bezos as the world\u2019s second-wealthiest person in 2022. \u201cA new chapter of pride and purpose is beginning. It is a historic opportunity for us to create a new Dharavi of dignity, safety and inclusiveness,\u201d Adani wrote in a message on his company\u2019s website after winning the bid to redevelop the area in 2022. He vowed to \u201ccreate a state-of-the-art world-class city, which will reflect a resurgent, self-assured, growing India finding its new place on the global stage as the 21st century belongs to India.\u201d But his vision of a new Dharavi has been met with mixed reactions, from hopeful residents ready for change to skeptics who have heard empty rhetoric for years. Some are vehemently against the proposal, with demonstrators taking to the streets in protest, concerned that Adani\u2019s plan could imperil their homes and businesses. \u201cWhen redevelopment happens, the only thing I want is to be relocated to the same place,\u201d Shaikh told CNN during a visit to his workshop in April, speaking as his employees hammered out soles and manipulated leather onto shoe moulds. \u201cIf I am thrown into some different area, I will lose all my business and my livelihood,\u201d he added. \u201cMy vendors and buyers will not know where I am moved, which would harm my business.\u201d Lofty promises Migrants have been flocking to Dharavi for more than a century, according to Mumbai authorities, many settling there because it was free and unregulated government-owned land. Almost from the start, Dharavi was defined by its industries: from the traditional potters of Gujarat who began arriving in the late 1800s, to leather tanners from Tamil Nadu and embroidery workers from Uttar Pradesh. The slum\u2019s growth reflected that of Mumbai itself, a diverse city famous for attracting Bollywood hopefuls and job-seekers from across India. Throughout the country, migrants and poorer populations often settle on \u201cperipheral lands, unwanted lands, because they\u2019re seen as hazardous in some way or uninhabitable,\u201d said Lalitha Kamath, a professor of urban planning and policy at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences in Mumbai. In Dharavi\u2019s case, \u201cthey built a habitable place \u2026 they reclaimed it from marshy land to something today that\u2019s really valuable,\u201d she added. But because of its informal nature, Dharavi remained undeveloped and haphazard for many years. It wasn\u2019t until the 1970s that the government made basic improvements: building key roads, laying sewers and water lines and providing residents with taps, toilets and electricity. For decades, the government struggled to find developers and builders who could carry out the expensive, logistically complicated task of redeveloping Dharavi from top to bottom. There were also many questions at play: Which residents would be re-located, and to where? How would business owners be compensated? Who would be eligible? \u201cAll slum redevelopment is quite fraught,\u201d Kamath said. But Dharavi had unique challenges due to the size of its population, the importance of its economy, and the value of the land \u2014 surrounded by affluent commercial districts in the heart of the city, close enough to the airport that arriving planes can see the sprawl of the slum from the air. After years of stalled progress and failed tendering processes, Adani\u2019s company won the right to redevelop Dharavi with a 50 billion rupee ($612 million) bid, Reuters reported at the time. It\u2019s expected to take seven years to complete, and is the latest mega-project taken on by Adani Enterprises, which already supplies electricity in Mumbai. His promises are lofty. About a million people will be \u201crehabilitated and resettled,\u201d with both residential homes and businesses up for redevelopment, he said in the message on his website. And, he vowed, residents will have better healthcare and recreational facilities, open spaces, a hospital and school, and more, he said. Ineligible residents who can\u2019t be rehoused within Dharavi will be given relocation options instead. But some residents aren\u2019t convinced. \u201cFor the last 30 years, we are dreaming and hearing about redevelopment, but nothing has taken place,\u201d said Dilip Gabekar, 60, who was born in Dharavi and works for a non-profit aiding women and children in the slum. \u201cOnly during elections, there is noise about redeveloping\u00a0Dharavi,\u201d he added, speaking to CNN weeks before Mumbai went to the polls in May in a nationwide election that ultimately saw Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his far-right Bharatiya Janata Party win another five-year term. \u201cBut once elections are over, the talks about redevelopment also die down,\u201d he added, despite Adani having won the bid long before the most recent general election. In response to CNN\u2019s request for comment, a spokesperson from the Dharavi Redevelopment Project Private Ltd (DRPPL) said the project was \u201ccommitted to fulfilling Dharavi\u2019s needs and providing residents with new homes with better amenities, accessibility, and resources.\u201d They added that they are exploring \u201call possible options\u201d to protect livelihoods and businesses, and to help raise people\u2019s incomes \u2014 for instance, by consolidating supply chains, giving all businesses tax refunds for five years and launching job initiatives for youth and women. Who gets a free house? Chief among residents\u2019 worries is their eligibility under Adani\u2019s plan, which could determine who gets a free new apartment in the redeveloped space and who may have to move elsewhere on their own dime. According to the DRPPL spokesperson, ground-floor residents who lived in Dharavi before the year 2000 will be granted a free unit within the area that is at least 350 square feet. Higher-floor residents, or those who lived there between 2000 and 2011, will receive a 300-square-foot home following a one-time payment of 250,000 rupees (about $3,000), located within 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) of Dharavi. Those who moved to Dharavi after 2011 will also receive a 300-square-foot home within the same radius, but will have to pay rent to the government. All apartments, either in or near Dharavi, will have separate bedrooms, toilets and kitchens, the spokesperson said. The plan is a collaboration between Adani and Maharashtra state authorities. The land itself will remain government-owned. With the last survey conducted in Dharavi 15 years ago, a firm hired by Adani is now going door to door to collect residents\u2019 information. That could spell trouble for many residents who never got the proper documents to prove their long-term tenancy. \u201cThere is no alternative for someone who has no proper paperwork,\u201d said Gabekar, the NGO worker.\u00a0Many of those deemed ineligible can\u2019t afford to relocate to the housing options provided by Adani, he added. Even those with the right papers are worried. Shaikh, the shoemaker, showed CNN his tenancy and business documents. They\u2019re written in smeared blue ink, laminated and kept carefully tucked away in a drawer. \u201cI have enough papers to prove that I have been in this place for a long time,\u201d he said. But, he added, many businesses have changed hands over the years, leaving new owners without the proper documents. Baburao Mane, a former elected state assembly member affiliated with the opposition party, and a Dharavi native himself, has led some of the most vocal protests against the Adani plan, including a rally in December that saw thousands of people march to Adani\u2019s offices in Mumbai. Only about 50,000 residents, about 5% of the population, have valid papers, Mane estimated. He claimed that the ongoing survey would bring that number down further. \u201cThey should make no difference between valid and non-valid papers to allot places. Anyone who has land in\u00a0Dharavi\u00a0should be given land during the redevelopment,\u201d he said. When asked about concerns over proving eligibility, the DRPPL spokesperson said its plan had \u201csuitable redressal mechanisms to address such eventualities.\u201d Even if eligible residents get re-housed within Dharavi, there are concerns over space. Often, several generations of a family live within cramped multi-story buildings. But only the ground-floor residents will receive the free housing, leaving about 700,000 upper-floor residents ineligible, NDTV reported. \u201cAll the houses in Dharavi have two or three floors \u2026 I have 15 family members who stay above each other (in the same building),\u201d said Neeta Jadhav, a 46-year-old resident who has lived in Dharavi for 26 years, and who has the documents to prove eligibility. \u201cIf we are all put in one small apartment there will be a lot of conflict, so the developer should consider giving us a bigger space,\u201d she said. Mane, the former politician and protest leader, said the group was demanding 500 square feet for each Dharavi household, vowing to \u201cnot let even one house be demolished\u201d until the government agrees to their conditions. Hope and mistrust Despite the pushback from some, there is uniform agreement among residents that Dharavi does need redevelopment. It\u2019s just a question of how, and who can be trusted with such a mammoth project. \u201cI will be happy if development takes place,\u201d said resident Jadhav. \u201cI want my children to have a better life, and move from here to a place that has proper amenities like a good school and a park for them to play.\u201d \u201cIf Adani gives what he has promised, then our life will improve for sure,\u201d she added. And there are some who are enthusiastically in favor of Adani\u2019s plan. \u201cIf Adani redevelops\u00a0Dharavi, it will be good for us as we don\u2019t want to stay\u00a0in Dharavi\u00a0any longer,\u201d said 42-year-old potter Dhanshuk Purshottamwala, whose family has lived in the area and run the pottery business for generations. He hopes Adani\u2019s plan will end that family tradition, with all their necessary papers in order. \u201cI don\u2019t want my children to be living the way I am,\u201d he said, speaking to CNN from his workshop where wet and drying pots line the walls and floors. \u201cI don\u2019t teach my children this skill, I want them to study and have a better life.\u201d While the redevelopment is a massive challenge, Adani is behind some of India\u2019s most ambitious infrastructure projects. He is India\u2019s largest airport operator and\u00a0owns India\u2019s biggest private port operator and private thermal power operator. He\u2019s also one of the country\u2019s largest developers and operators of coal mines, and is simultaneously building the world\u2019s biggest clean energy plant. However, he\u2019s a relative newcomer in the field of slum redevelopment and affordable housing, said Kamath, adding that the lack of affordable housing is what prompted people to set up informal settlements in the first place. And for most residents that CNN spoke to, their hopes for change are dimmed by deep distrust of Adani\u2019s conglomerate and the city government. Several pointed to the 2023 fraud allegations against the Adani Group, which sparked an ongoing investigation by India\u2019s regulators and lost the company over $100 billion in value in a stock market meltdown.\u00a0In January, the country\u2019s top court ordered the regulators to quickly finish their investigation\u00a0and said no further probes were needed, a decision Adani celebrated at the time. His representatives have called the allegations baseless and malicious. Others residents complained about a lack of transparency, saying they had received little official communication and were not included in meetings about the redevelopment, leaving them in the dark about the details or timing of the plan. This is common across many slum redevelopments in India, said Kamath, describing these projects as top-down, with power held by a small group of private developers and state officials. \u201cFolks from the community will very rarely get much space at the table,\u201d she said. It\u2019s one reason why \u201cthere are concerns with all kinds of redevelopment projects that have been proposed, not just this one, because they usually don\u2019t do justice to every group that lives there or has claim to that space, who has made it what it is today,\u201d she said. Then, there\u2019s an ongoing lawsuit by a rival company that alleged the Maharashtra state government had improperly canceled an original 2018 bidding process\u00a0and restarted it so Adani could win, according to Reuters. The state and Adani deny any wrongdoing, but that hasn\u2019t stopped many residents from viewing Adani and his government ties with suspicion. Adani is a vocal champion of Prime Minister Modi, and opposition leaders have ferociously questioned their relationship \u2014 with some even claiming that they were punished for pursuing the issue. The DRPPL spokesperson said Adani had won the project \u201cthrough an open, transparent, fair, and competitive bidding process,\u201d and said claims of any political relationships were \u201cbaseless and aimed at spreading misinformation.\u201d Meanwhile, some are simply tired of listening to the same old promises. \u201cI have grown\u00a0from a child to a woman (in Dharavi) and the development saga just keeps going on,\u201d said Reshma Prasant Bobde, a 42-year-old housewife whose family has lived there for generations. She described seeing the same cycle of politicians pushing redevelopment for \u201ctheir own agenda,\u201d followed by residents protesting and, ultimately, stagnation. \u201cThis talk of development\u00a0has been going on since my grandmother\u2019s time, but it hasn\u2019t moved an inch,\u201d she said. \u201cMy children, who are 11 and seven years old, will grow old and nothing will change in\u00a0Dharavi.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/29/business/india-adani-slum-redevelopment-concerns-intl-hnk-dst/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk", "text": "In a year of wild tech stories that has seen Elon Musk transform Twitter, cryptocurrency exchange FTX collapse and Silicon Valley Bank implode, this week\u2019s whiplash-inducing turmoil at OpenAI is among the most captivating. Sam Altman \u2014 the leader of one of the world\u2019s most influential AI companies, OpenAI, and perhaps the\u00a0most visible figure in the fledgling industry \u2014 was fired Friday night by the startup\u2019s directors in a surprise move. Less than five days later, he\u2019s back as the company\u2019s CEO, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. The series of extraordinary events unfolded just days after OpenAI held its\u00a0first-ever developer conference, where it laid out new, commercialized versions of its technology, including the option to customize its ChatGPT AI chatbot. If you\u2019re just catching up, here\u2019s what you missed from a week so incredible you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking the script could have been written by an early version of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Friday Around 3 p.m. ET, Altman joined a Google Meet call with most of OpenAI\u2019s board that had been convened by fellow co-founder and OpenAI chief scientist\u00a0Ilya Sutskever, during which Altman was fired and told that the news would soon be made public. Within the next half hour, the board also informed Greg Brockman, another co-founder and OpenAI president, that he would be removed from the board. Around 3:30 p.m. ET, OpenAI publicly announced that it had fired Altman over concerns that he was not always truthful with the board. The board said Mira Murati, the company\u2019s chief technology officer, would become interim CEO. OpenAI\u2019s strategic partners, including its biggest financial backer Microsoft, were also reportedly informed of Altman\u2019s ouster just minutes before the board\u2019s announcement. Hours after being fired, Altman posted on X that he \u201cloved working with such talented people\u201d and that he would have \u201cmore to say about what\u2019s next later.\u201d Brockman promptly quit. \u201cPlease don\u2019t spend any time being concerned. We will be fine,\u201d Brockman\u00a0said in a Friday post\u00a0on X. \u201cGreater things coming soon.\u201d A key factor in the CEO\u2019s firing was\u00a0tension between Altman, who favored developing AI\u00a0more aggressively, and members of the OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the unfolding events. Saturday Within 24 hours of Altman being fired, reports emerged that he and other ex-OpenAI loyalists were mulling plans for their own venture. OpenAI\u2019s board was also reportedly having second thoughts and considering asking the ousted CEO to return. Sunday By Sunday afternoon, Altman was\u00a0back at OpenAI\u2019s headquarters\u00a0\u2014 this time with a guest badge \u2014 to negotiate his potential return. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reportedly mediated the discussion. A 5 p.m. PT deadline was reportedly set for the board to agree to Altman\u2019s demands, including adding a seat for Microsoft, and reinstating him as CEO. But those talks broke down. As Sunday turned into Monday, Nadella tweeted that Altman, along with Brockman, would join Microsoft to run a new AI research group. At OpenAI, the group found a new interim CEO: Emmett Shear, the former CEO of Amazon\u2019s streaming service, Twitch. Murati would return to her role as OpenAI\u2019s chief technology officer. Monday In a post on X early Monday, Shear, who left his role at Twitch in March, described the chance to join OpenAI as \u201ca once-in-a-lifetime\u201d opportunity. He added that the company would hire an independent investigator to report on what happened in the lead-up to Altman\u2019s firing. But OpenAI employees were not convinced. More than 500 staffers signed an open letter calling on the company\u2019s board to resign and reinstate Altman and Brockman. They also threatened to follow the co-founders to Microsoft if their demands were not met. Altman posted on X, saying, \u201cwe have more unity and commitment and focus than ever before. we are all going to work together some way or other, and i\u2019m so excited. one team, one mission.\u201d The drama was far from over.\u00a0The Verge reported Monday afternoon\u00a0that Altman and Brockman could still return to OpenAI if the board members who fired him resign. And Nadella, speaking to CNBC, said he was \u201copen to both options\u201d when asked whether Altman would actually join Microsoft. \u201cLook, that is for the OpenAI board and management and the employees to choose,\u201d Nadella said. \u201cWe chose to explicitly partner with OpenAI and we want to continue to do so, and obviously, that depends on the people of OpenAI staying there or coming to Microsoft.\u201d Tuesday Altman\u00a0was reinstated late Tuesday as OpenAI\u2019s CEO, the company said on X. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman\u00a0wrote\u00a0that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his\u00a0post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it has backed with billions to bolster its ambitions in developing AI. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Nadella\u00a0said\u00a0on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_17_success_how-to-find-good-affordable-colleges", "text": "Long before you take your high schooler on college campus tours, consider this: Shopping for college shouldn\u2019t be any different than shopping for a home.\u00a0When you want to buy a home, you come up with a range of how much you can afford and get pre-qualified for a mortgage. Then you look in neighborhoods that offer homes that meet your family\u2019s needs and fall within your price range. \u201cAdopt a mindset that we\u2019re buying college like we\u2019re buying a house,\u201d said Beth Walker, author of \u201cBuying College Better\u201d and \u201cNever Pay Retail for College.\u201d As a financial adviser and certified\u00a0college planning specialist, Walker tries to help families avoid a situation that many find themselves in at the 11th hour: Their child applies \u2014 and gets into \u2014 schools they cannot afford because the schools won\u2019t give them enough aid. And then they just \u2026 try to make it work, no matter how much debt is involved for the parents or the student. Instead, she advises families to start as early as 9th or 10th grade in figuring out what is affordable for them as a family \u2014 so parents don\u2019t sacrifice their own financial welfare and the future college student doesn\u2019t drown in debt upon graduation. And second, she recommends assessing how a child\u2019s talents and interests pare with majors and careers they might want to pursue. Doing both those things can help you target the right colleges to apply to. Mike McKinnon, executive director of the National Institute of Certified College Planners, defines the perfect college as one \u201cwhere a student can go be happy, safe and successful, graduate in four years or less with a marketable degree and little or no debt.\u201d In helping families align parents\u2019 affordability constraints with their student\u2019s academic and social needs, he cautions them not to automatically assume the Ivys or other high-prestige schools will be best simply because of their status. And he stresses what success in life looks like after college and notes that an Ivy League degree isn\u2019t the only path to achieving it, especially if your child won\u2019t get much aid to attend. In fact, said Todd Fothergill, founder and CEO of Strategies for College, a lot of brand-name schools don\u2019t even offer merit-based aid, only need-based. So if you\u2019re not rich, but you make too much to qualify for need-based aid, you could find yourself having to cover the entire cost of tuition, room and board every year, which is pushing $90,000 at some US colleges. Set up financial guardrails well before the college search Fothergill created a free calculator called CostHero that lets parents assess what financial resources they will have available to pay for a child\u2019s college education. It then provides a range of affordability: At the low end is the number representing what they can pay if they don\u2019t take on debt. And at the high end is the number they can pay if they also take out an unsubsidized federal Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students (PLUS). \u201cIf you\u2019re not in a position to write a check for $90,000 a year, put up guardrails for yourself so you don\u2019t blow up your retirement,\u201d he said. The calculator inputs let you set the amount of resources you\u2019re willing to use to pay for college from your income and savings, your child\u2019s earnings from summer jobs, any family gifts, and any federal Stafford loans your child may take. It also factors in if you qualify for the federal American Opportunity Tax Credit. That credit, for qualified educational expenses, will reduce your tax bill or increase any refund you have coming. The calculator also gives you a debt-to-income score like the kind a mortgage lender might use to assess whether you\u2019re a good credit risk. Ideally, he said, you don\u2019t want your housing costs to exceed 36% of your gross income and your total debt \u2014 including debt from housing, cars, credit cards and any parental education loans \u2014 to exceed 43%. If your DTI ratio is close to or higher than 43% that is a sign you could get yourself into trouble if you end up having any financial problems while your child is in college, Fothergill said. \u201cIf folks have a way to determine the range of affordability prior to the onset of the college search, the outcomes are a lot better.\u00a0 For example, if one knows that the range of affordability is between $30,000 [a year] with no parent debt and $50,000 with parent debt, then any college that comes in with a net cost in that range is, by definition, affordable,\u201d Fothergill said. Net cost refers to the true cost of attendance after figuring out how much aid your child may get (e.g., grants and scholarships). Figure out where your student may qualify for the most aid Generally speaking, the biggest tuition discounts go to the most academically accomplished students in an incoming class. \u201cThe student needs to be in the top 25% of those admitted,\u201d Walker said. Getting into that top 25% cohort is based on SAT or ACT scores, and having a high, unweighted GPA based on a rigorous high school curriculum. The curriculum\u2019s academic rigor can be further bolstered by taking AP courses. Since your child is more likely to make the top quartile at some schools than others, Fothergill and Walker both recommend your child focus on applying only to those schools in which they stand the best chances of being in that top group to maximize their chances for merit-based aid. Otherwise, you\u2018ll spend money to apply to guidance-counselor-recommended \u201csafety\u201d schools or \u201creach\u201d schools with no sense if those places are affordable to you should your child get in. Using reported data from admissions officers about their key criteria in admitting an incoming class and based on what more than 1,000 schools report about the qualifications they used to grant aid, Fothergill created another tool called ListHero. It gives students a score that helps gauge\u00a0how competitive their profile is\u00a0at a given school, relative to others admitted, and by extension their eligibility for tuition discounts. Right now the tool is only available to college planning professionals for a fee. But Fothergill plans to create a free mini-version for consumers to use. For parents doing their own research on test scores, GPA requirements, costs and aid, he recommends checking the Department of Education College Scorecard, the site CollegeData.com and the College Board. Other ways to reduce college costs before applying While your children are in high school they can take other steps to reduce the total cost of their education. One way is by doing well on the PSAT to qualify to compete for a National Merit Scholarship. Another is to take AP courses. If their high school doesn\u2019t offer them, there is a program called Freshman Year for Free offered by the Modern States Education Alliance. It provides free AP placement courses and pays the fee for students to take the AP tests or college-level preparation (CLEP) tests administered through the College Board. Getting the minimum AP scores a college requires to earn a college credit will lower how much you ultimately have to spend on tuition. A third option is to see if your state has a program that offers a year of free in-state community college, the credits from which can be transferred to a state university from which your child could earn their degree. Or, if you plan to go to any other college, make sure the school will accept the credits from a community college course you plan to take. No matter what steps you take, starting the research and budgeting process early can save everyone a lot of stress, debt and potential heartache in the end. Said Walker: \u201cWe have to be a lot more intentional about this purchase.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/success/how-to-find-good-affordable-colleges/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "business"}}

GasBuddy projects\u00a0the national average price for regular gas will stand at $3.49 a gallon on Independence Day. That\u2019s a penny shy of the price a year ago and down sharply from $4.79 two years ago when oil prices spiked after Russia invaded Ukraine. Adjusted for inflation, US gas prices are almost exactly where they were in July 2018, according to federal data.

{"id": "2024_07_01_business_china-economy-uneven-recovery-intl-hnk", "text": "Factory activity among China\u2019s private firms expanded at the fastest pace in three years, a private gauge showed Monday, suggesting healthier domestic and international demand for Chinese goods.  This contrasts with the results of an official government survey Sunday that showed a contraction among larger, state-owned manufacturers, underscoring that the recovery in the world\u2019s second largest economy remains uneven. The Caixin manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI)\u00a0rose to 51.8 in June, up from 51.7 in May, according to a statement from S&P Global, which compiled the survey. The numbers not only beat market expectations but also marked the sixth straight month of improvement in the index. But the gauge conflicted with the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS)\u2019s PMI, which was unchanged from May at 49.5, marking a second consecutive month of contraction. The PMI\u00a0is a monthly indicator of economic activity. A reading above\u00a050\u00a0indicates expansion, while anything below that level shows\u00a0contraction. \u201cThe divergence\u201d between the Caixin and the official PMIs has widened further from May and is likely because of differences in the sectors covered, said analysts from Goldman Sachs on Monday. The Caixin survey covers more export-oriented and consumer-related companies. The official PMI, however, is tilted more towards manufacturers that produce industrial materials \u2014 including steel, cement, and chemical \u2014 making them more vulnerable to a slowdown in fixed-asset investments. Analysts believe that the current data reflects an economic reality characterised by strong exports and consumption, but softer investment. \u201cDemand for consumer and intermediate goods was stronger than that for investment goods,\u201d said Wang Zhe, senior economist at Caixin Insight Group. \u201cOverall, the manufacturing sector kept improving in June, with supply, domestic demand, and exports continuing to grow,\u201d he added. Customs data for June are not available yet, but statistics for May showed that the country\u2019s exports jumped 7.6% from a year earlier, beating analysts\u2019 forecasts. Still, manufacturers are less optimistic about the outlook, as recent tariff announcements from the US and European Union have damped their sentiment. \u201cThe gauge for future output expectations \u2026 fell by more than three points from the previous month, marking the lowest since November 2019,\u201d Wang said. \u201cConcerns expressed by surveyed companies [in the Caixin index] were focused on prominent downward pressure on the economy and intense market competition,\u201d he added. Last month, the EU announced additional tariffs of up to 38.1% on electric vehicles imported from China,because of what it sees as Beijing\u2019s unfair support for companies that undercut European carmakers. The provisional tariffs are set to apply by July 4, while the investigation will continue. The duties will then be finalized on November 2 at the end of the probe. The EU\u2019s decision came a month after the United States quadrupled tariffs on EVs from China, from 25% to 100%, a move aimed at boosting American jobs and manufacturing.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/business/china-economy-uneven-recovery-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "business"}}

With interest rate cuts on the backburner, Wall Street is looking to corporate earnings to continue powering the 2024 stock market rally. Analysts polled by FactSet expect second-quarter earnings of S&P 500 companies to grow about 8.7% on average from the prior year. That would mark the fourth-straight quarter of annual earnings growth for the benchmark index. Strong corporate earnings have helped the S&P 500 gain a whopping 16% and notch repeated record high closes this year. That\u2019s despite sticky inflation during the first quarter pushing interest rate expectations further out. While data in recent months has signaled that inflation is cooling again, the Federal Reserve penciled in just one interest rate cut for 2024 at its June policy meeting. Investors are now forecasting up to three cuts, but at the beginning of the year, they were projecting up to six or seven. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday at a central bank policy forum in Sintra, Portugal, that prices are back on a \u201cdisinflationary path.\u201d But he maintained that the central bank needs to see more data before easing rates. Since the Fed isn\u2019t likely to cut rates anytime soon, the onus is on strong corporate earnings to continue driving the market rally. High interest rates tend to weigh on stocks, since they increase corporate borrowing costs and make virtually risk-free government bonds more attractive. \u201cEarnings growth will be key to holding, or potentially building on these gains,\u201d wrote Jeffrey Buchbinder, chief equity strategist at LPL Financial, in a Monday note. Earnings season kicks off July 12 when big banks including JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup report results. Investors will watch for clues about the health of the consumer. Recent economic data and warnings from retailers have signaled that lower- and middle-income Americans are tightening their purse strings. The June jobs report, due Friday, will give investors insight into the strength of the labor market. Preliminary data Tuesday revealed that job openings unexpectedly jumped higher to 8.14 million in May, suggesting the labor market remains resilient in the face of sky-high rates. Investors will also keep close tabs on results from mega-cap tech stocks, whose blockbuster returns account for much of the market\u2019s gains this year. Shares of Nvidia, the leader of the pack, are up 159% in 2024 after reaching a $3 trillion market cap for the first time in June. Microsoft shares are up 23% and Meta Platforms shares have jumped 44%. Shares of Amazon, which joined the $2 trillion club last month, are up 30%. Wall Street is looking for signs that these companies\u2019 balance sheets match their lofty valuations. The S&P 500\u2019s total return for the first half of the year, including dividends, is 15.3%, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices data. Without Nvidia\u2019s gains, the index\u2019s total return is 10.7%. \u201cHigh valuations will also need to be defended from rising uncertainty around monetary and fiscal policy, domestic and international elections and geopolitical conflict,\u201d wrote Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, in a Monday note. How Japan\u2019s newest yen note came from the Nepali mountains Banks across Japan began stocking their ATMs on Wednesday with shiny new yen notes sourced from an unlikely location \u2014 vibrant yellow flowering paperbush shrubs that grow on craggy Himalayan mountains in Nepal. Before entering the wallets of Japanese consumers, the yen notes had a long, complex journey involving months of labor and transport by land and air across thousands of kilometers, report my colleagues Jessie Yeung, Hanako Montgomery and Junko Ogura. And this process has offered a potential new source of income to communities in one of the world\u2019s poorest countries, by providing cash for one of its richest. Though Japan has pushed for more digital payments in recent years, cash still reigns king, and it trails behind other Asian countries like China that have gone almost completely cashless. \u201cI really think that Nepal contributed to Japan\u2019s economy, as cash is fundamental to the Japanese economy,\u201d said Tadashi Matsubara, president of Kanpou, the company that produces paper for the Japanese government. \u201cWithout Nepal, Japan would not function.\u201d Read more here. Chinese government bonds are on fire. That\u2019s ringing alarm bells in Beijing Money is rushing into Chinese government bonds, sending their prices soaring and yields plunging to record lows as investors hunt for a safer alternative to the country\u2019s ravaged real estate market and volatile stocks, reports my colleague Laura He. The yield on China\u2019s onshore 10-year government bond, which is a benchmark for a wide range of interest rates, touched 2.18% this week, the lowest since 2002, when records began. Yields on 20-year and 30-year bonds are also hovering around historic lows. Bond yields, or the returns offered to investors for holding them, fall as prices rise. Lower borrowing costs should be welcome in an economy struggling to recover from a property crash, sluggish consumer spending and weak business confidence. But the sharp move in bonds is sparking talk of a bubble and triggering acute anxiety among China\u2019s policymakers, who fear a crisis similar to the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) last year. The People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC) has issued over 10 separate warnings since April about the risk that a bond bubble could burst, destabilizing financial markets and derailing the Chinese economy\u2019s uneven recovery. Now it\u2019s doing something unprecedented \u2014borrowing bonds to sell them to tamp down prices. \u201cSVB in the United States has taught us that the central bank needs to observe and evaluate the situation of the financial market from a macro-prudential perspective,\u201d PBOC Governor Pan Gongsheng said at a financial forum in Shanghai late last month.

{"id": "2024_07_05_business_ultra-rich-indian-weddings-economy-intl-hnk", "text": "The wedding of the year is\u00a0here. In less than a week, Anant Ambani, son of Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani, will marry his girlfriend Radhika Merchant. India is no stranger to opulent weddings, but the preparations and parties for this particular union have transfixed the country. Jaw-dropping guest lists, which have included Silicon Valley\u00a0billionaires and Bollywood stars, have underscored Mukesh Ambani\u2019s growing influence in the global economy. Asia\u2019s richest family has also shown off its wealth with a display of jewels evoking the long-gone era of maharajahs and Mughal emperors. The Ambanis have set a new benchmark for big, fat Indian weddings, which are bound to grow bigger and louder than ever before as the number of the ultra-rich swells in the world\u2019s fastest-growing major economy. \u201cThe Ambani wedding parties have \u2026 had a multi-faceted impact on the wedding industry in India, influencing trends, boosting demand for wedding vendors, promoting cultural heritage and even driving economic growth,\u201d Tim Chi, CEO of The Knot Worldwide,\u00a0a wedding planning service,\u00a0told CNN. The Indian wedding industry has boomed since the country emerged from the pandemic. Estimated at about $130 billion, it\u2019s now nearly twice the size of America\u2019s, although still smaller than that of China\u2019s, according to a report by Jefferies last month. \u201cAn otherwise value-conscious society, Indians love to spend on weddings,\u201d Jefferies said. \u201cAnd this is irrespective of the economic classes.\u201d At about $15,000, the average Indian wedding costs more than\u00a0three\u00a0times the average annual household income. More than a status symbol Weddings can be expensive affairs in any country, but in India they are especially important as symbols of power and status. Parents in South Asia typically spend a significant portion of their lifetime savings on their children\u2019s weddings, but the scale of many of these events has now become gargantuan, coinciding with India\u2019s rise as an economic powerhouse. \u201cIn the last decade there has been a big shift in Indian weddings across the board,\u201d said Sima Taparia, a\u00a0marriage consultant\u00a0who became a household name in the country after starring in the hit Netflix docuseries \u201cIndian Matchmaking.\u201d It is now common for wealthy Indians to host big weddings at exotic destinations abroad and invite Bollywood actors or famous musicians to perform, she added. \u201cThe Indian wedding is about the power of contacts, the power of relationships and the power of wealth,\u201d said Aditya Motwane, an events planner who founded Motwane Entertainment & Weddings and worked on the wedding of actress Priyanka Chopra\u00a0and singer Nick Jonas\u00a0in 2018. \u201cYou show everyone you know that you\u2019ve arrived in life through these kinds of celebrations,\u201d he added. Indian weddings are often spread across several days, with an average guest list of 326, compared with 115 in the United States, according to The Knot Worldwide. The scale is exponentially\u00a0bigger when it comes to the affluent, whose weddings involve thousands of guests, foreign locations and expensive gifts. Ambani\u2019s\u00a0three-day pre-wedding party in the western Indian city of Jamnagar in March was\u00a0attended by around 1,200 high-profile guests, including Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates. It is not uncommon for the very wealthy to spend many millions on the festivities. At the Ambani party, an elaborate light show featuring 5,500 drones lit up the sky above a glass palace custom-built for the festivities, where guests danced to a performance by none other than Rihanna. The outrageously rich also come up with some unusual requests. One couple asked Motwane to arrange for an elephant \u2014 a sacred animal to Hindus \u2014 to be in Monte Carlo to bless them. With India set to become the world\u2019s third-largest economy by 2027, extravagant weddings are expected to become even more frequent. According to a report from real estate consultancy Knight Frank, the number of Indians with a net worth of at least $30 million will rise by 50% over the five years to 2028, the biggest increase of any country. And, lower down the economic ladder, by 2030 some 600 million Indians are projected to be middle-class, a segment that will represent over 80% of the country\u2019s spending power. \u201cAs the middle class grows, so does their disposable income, which inevitably is spent on lavish parties and celebrations,\u201d said Tina Tharwani, co-founder of wedding planning company Shaadi Squad. Rihanna, couture and emeralds The average luxury Indian wedding can cost anywhere between $200,000 and $400,000, according to Jefferies. This kind of budget allows for accommodation at five-star hotels across the world, sumptuous catering, decor and entertainment, and sometimes includes Bollywood actors or international singers. But the Jefferies cost estimate does not include expenses on jewelry or attire. Bridal spending accounts for over half of the total jewelry market it India, the bank noted. The country is one of the largest markets for gold, but its appetite for diamonds and other precious gems is also growing. The emerald necklace worn by Nita Ambani, the groom\u2019s mother, at the festivities in March stunned the internet with its size and sparkle. No luxury Indian wedding\u00a0is complete without\u00a0lavish meals, which at times involves flying in Michelin star chefs and the finest of ingredients from across the world. An extra layer of expense is often added to the budget because many Indians don\u2019t eat meat, and some avoid root vegetables as well. Motwane recalls planning a wedding in Florence where many guests did not eat garlic or onion. The Italian cooks \u201chit the roof,\u201d he said. A renowned Indian Italian chef and her team were then flown in. A range of other businesses are poised for growth as Ambani-style high-profile weddings lead to a \u201ctrickle-down effect,\u201d setting \u201cnew trends and standards (and) influencing couples\u2019 expectations,\u201d said Tharwani, who worked on Indian cricketer\u00a0Virat Kohli\u2019s wedding in Tuscany. Vanessa Almeida, who looked after packaging and delivery of some 8,000 gifts for Ambani\u2019s guests at the jamboree in March, told CNN that similar party favors are becoming sought-after across the country. Of the many expensive\u00a0presents that the family showered upon its A-list guests \u2014 from silver candle sticks and shawls to\u00a0terrariums and bird houses \u2014 customized leather products\u00a0are among those that have caught on, said Almeida, owner of The Gift House in Goa. Demand for wedding videographers has also boomed in the last decade, with companies charging as much as $10,000 for a film. Many couples also shoot pre-wedding videos, which are painstakingly choreographed and\u00a0inspired by Bollywood musicals. \u201cBrides and grooms go for pre-wedding shoots across the globe,\u201d said Taparia. Local economy The rise in opulent celebrations held abroad has led to some consternation among the local communities, wedding planners say. In late May, the Ambanis held a four-day Mediterranean cruise for friends and family, with a bevy of Bollywood stars and performances by Katy Perry, the Backstreet Boys and Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli. Not everyone was impressed. The partygoers drew the ire of residents in the port city of Genoa, according to media reports, as they kept several neighborhoods awake with loud music until dawn. But, despite the occasional inconvenience, such functions also generate revenue and employment in the area. \u201cYou\u2019re looking at a minimum of 2-3 million euros coming in over three days,\u201d said Motwane. The Indian government is now trying to get a bigger chunk of the luxury wedding revenue, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi launching a \u201cWed in India\u201d campaign to encourage affluent families to get married in the country. \u201cPeople often spend significant amounts of money to get married abroad,\u201d Modi said in March. But by hosting weddings in India, \u201cfamilies can enjoy lavish celebrations for three to four days, providing livelihood opportunities for locals.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/business/ultra-rich-indian-weddings-economy-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_success_saving-under-high-interest-rates", "text": "Editor\u2019s Note: This is an updated version of an article that originally ran on May 1. As was widely expected, the Federal Reserve left its benchmark interest rate unchanged for its seventh meeting in a row on Wednesday. People carrying variable-rate debt like credit cards and those seeking a loan won\u2019t be happy given that the Fed\u2019s rate, which directly and indirectly affects consumers\u2019 borrowing costs, remains at a 23-year high. Those rates will likely stay high for a while. At this point, only one cut is seen as likely before the end of the year, according to US central bankers\u2019 latest summary of economic projections. But whenever the cuts start, they may be small. \u201cAbsent a complete about-face from the economy, interest rates aren\u2019t likely to come down soon enough, or fast enough, to provide meaningful relief to borrowers. Utilize zero-percent credit card balance transfer offers, shop around for lower fixed-rate personal loans and home equity loans, and channel as much income as possible toward paying down this debt as quickly as possible,\u201d said Greg McBride, Bankrate.com\u2019s chief financial analyst. But the Fed\u2019s decision leaves savers, once again, in the catbird seat when it comes to making money on their money. \u201cSavers are enjoying the best returns on savings accounts and CDs in more than 15 years, with the most competitive offers outpacing inflation. In addition, these conditions are poised to persist for the foreseeable future,\u201d McBride said. Online high-yield savings accounts The best bang for your savings can still be had in online high-yield savings accounts at FDIC-insured banks, which yield way more than today\u2019s 0.58% overall average savings rate. As of June 11, the average online savings account rate was 4.40%, according to DepositAccounts.com. And many online high-yield accounts continue to offer rates of 5% or more. Say you have $10,000 in savings. If you leave it parked in a regular savings account at 0.5%, you\u2019ll get $50 in interest for a year. If you put it instead in a 5% high-yield account, you\u2019ll get $500. A high-yield savings account is the best place to park money you\u2019ll need to cover emergencies as well as anticipated large expenses that you have to pay in the next three months to a year. As with any savings account, banks can lower the rate they offer \u2014 also known as the APY \u2014 at any time. And you can be sure they will do just that when the Fed looks like it will finally start cutting rates, McBride said. But, he added, since rates are likely to be cut in small increments, online high-yield savings accounts may continue to offer inflation-beating returns for some time. \u201cThey will still offer the best way to preserve your [money\u2019s] buying power,\u201d McBride said. Money market accounts and money market funds Money market deposit accounts and money market mutual funds are generating yields competitive with the best high-yield savings accounts. But there are important differences. Money market deposit accounts are bank products. So, assuming your bank is FDIC insured, your account is too. (Or, if your account is at a federally backed credit union, your money will be\u00a0insured by the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund.) As with high-yield accounts, you may get the best deals at an online bank. But money market accounts may have a higher minimum deposit requirement than a high-yield account. Money market funds, by contrast, are an investment product \u2014 they generate return by investing in short-term, low-risk debt instruments and are currently yielding an average of 5.12%, according to the Crane 100 Money Fund Index. Such funds are a good place to park cash you have in your brokerage account that you may want to use at some point to buy equities or bonds, McBride said. Money market funds are not FDIC-insured, but any brokerage you use should be insured by the\u00a0Securities Investor Protection Corporation, which\u00a0covers your funds up to a limit if your brokerage ever goes under. Certificates of deposit CDs are still a great place to park any money you can leave untouched for a fixed\u00a0period of time \u2014 anywhere from a few months to five years or longer. As of June 11, the average rate was 4.971% on an online one-year CD, and 3.815% on a five-year CD, according to DepositAccounts.com. While your brick-and-mortar bank may offer a CD at a good rate, you may get a better one shopping around. The easiest way to do that without having to set up an additional account at another bank is to shop for CDs through your online brokerage, which is likely to offer a wide array of CDs from many different banks. At Schwab.com, for instance, CDs on offer ranging in duration from three months all the way up to 10 years offered average annual returns over 5%, with most ranging between 5.30% and 5.45%. The highest annual average was 5.56% for a three-month CD. If you have to withdraw money before the end of a CD\u2019s term, you can always get all of your principal back but may forfeit some of the interest earned as an early withdrawal penalty. Treasury bills and notes Beyond deposit accounts, investing in short-term Treasury bills and intermediate-term Treasury notes has been another way to earn a competitive return with virtually no risk since Treasuries are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. Treasury bills come in six different maturities: 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 13 weeks, 17 weeks, 26 weeks and 52 weeks. Treasury notes mature in two, three, five, seven or 10 years. \u201cAs long as the Fed holds its rate in the 5.25% to 5.5% range, we expect most Treasury bill yields to hover around 5.25% as well,\u201d said Collin Martin, fixed income strategist at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. But, Martin added, \u201cWhile the timing of rate cuts has been pushed back, we still expect them to arrive later this year, and investors in short-term investments would likely face reinvestment risk.\u201d That\u2019s why he suggests investors consider buying some intermediate-term investments now before rates are cut if they want to lock in a higher yield for some of their money, such as Treasury notes maturing in the next four to 10 years. On Wednesday, yields on Treasury bills were north of 5% and yields on Treasury notes were north of 4%, according to Schwab.com. When deciding whether it makes sense to invest in a CD or a Treasury for the same duration, you might opt for the Treasury if you live in a high-tax state, McBride suggested, since interest on Treasuries is\u00a0exempt from state and local taxes. In all instances, the easiest way to purchase Treasuries and other bonds is to do so through your brokerage account.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/success/saving-under-high-interest-rates/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_05_economy_june-jobs-report-final", "text": "Welcome to the \u201csteady-as-she-goes\u201d US labor market: Halfway through 2024, job gains are cooling slightly but overall employment activity remains solidly stable. The US economy added 206,000 jobs in June, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday, easing from a downwardly revised May tally of 215,000 jobs. The unemployment rate moved a little higher, up 0.1 percentage points to 4.1%, marking the first time since November 2021 that the jobless rate was above 4%. That\u2019s not too shabby at a time when interest rates are at a 23-year high and the Federal Reserve is looking for inflation and overall demand to cool before bringing down rates, said Gus Faucher, chief economist for the PNC Financial Services Group. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing job growth slow a bit; we\u2019ve seen the unemployment rate tick up a little bit; we\u2019ve seen wage growth slow a bit,\u201d Faucher told CNN in an interview. \u201cBut those are all good news from the Fed\u2019s perspective, should help reduce inflationary pressures coming from the labor market, and should support Fed rate cuts toward the end of this year.\u201d Economists were expecting employers to have added 190,000 jobs last month and for the unemployment rate to remain at 4%, according to FactSet consensus estimates. Here are some of key points from the latest employment snapshot: Government and health care again led the way June\u2019s job gains were more broadly based than they have been in the past few months, but the growth was largely concentrated in two sectors: government and health care. The largest chunk of job gains occurred in the public sector, which added a net 70,000 jobs, specifically local government excluding education (up 34,100). The health care industry added another 48,600 positions. \u201cThis\u00a0is another proof point for a steady-as-she-goes\u00a0labor market\u00a0where demand is shifting in some key sectors and employers and employees are staying put,\u201d Ger Doyle, ManpowerGroup\u2019s senior vice president, said in a statement issued Friday. Some of the largest job losses occurred in temporary help services, which were down 48,900 for the month, dragging down the professional and business services super sector, which lost 17,000. Manufacturing and retail also saw losses, of 8,000 and 8,500, respectively. The temporary help category is often closely watched by economists as it could serve as a forward-looking economic data point in an otherwise lagging indicator: If companies are growing, they\u2019ll often get temporary help until they can hire for a full-time position; but if times are tougher, the temp workers usually are the first to go. \u201cThe sharp decline in\u00a0temporary help may portend future weakness in the labor market this summer,\u201d Jack McIntyre, portfolio manager at Brandywine Global, wrote in commentary issued Friday. Potential inflationary pressure slowed Wage growth cooled as anticipated, with average hourly earnings rising 0.3% for the month and slowing to 3.9% on an annual basis, its lowest rate in three years. Slowing wages help set the stage for the\u00a0Federal Reserve\u00a0to begin cutting interest\u00a0rates\u00a0\u2014 if it also ends up translating into slower\u00a0inflation. Strong wage growth can put upward pressure on prices, but\u00a0Fed\u00a0officials have said they focus primarily on\u00a0inflation\u00a0gauges to know if price hikes are under control or not. It\u2019s possible for workers to rake in robust wage gains if productivity is keeping up, but last year\u2019s productivity burst lost some steam in early 2024. The labor force participation rate inched up to 62.6% from 62.5% after retreating by 0.2 percentage points in May. Through the first half of the year, the US has added 1.3 million jobs at an average pace of 222,000 per month, BLS data shows. April and May\u2019s job gains were both revised lower by a combined 111,000 jobs to 108,000 for April (down 57,000) and 218,000 for May (down 54,000). Hiring activity is milder than this point last year \u2014 and job growth has retreated from the blockbuster pace of 2021 and 2022, during the pandemic recovery. However, the labor market remains historically strong. The US just notched its 42nd consecutive month of job growth, the fifth-longest employment expansion on record. Unemployment rate increased for the third month in a row Much of the recent employment expansion has been marked by historically low unemployment: 30 months\u2019 worth at or below 4%. However, that streak broke in June, when the jobless rate moved higher to 4.1%. It\u2019s the third month in a row that the unemployment rate increased. That\u2019s notable but not necessarily worrisome just yet, Faucher said. \u201cIf we look at the last Fed dot plot, the median unemployment rate is 4.2% for the long run; we\u2019re right around that,\u201d Faucher said, referencing the central bank\u2019s latest economic projections. \u201cSo, this means that we\u2019re at the Fed\u2019s definition of maximum employment; it means that wage pressures are less pronounced coming from the labor market; and it\u2019s a good, solid labor market that is consistent with low inflation and solid long-run economic growth.\u201d Still, Friday\u2019s report did appear to confirm what other recent employment data has been showing: Job opportunities have shrank (but still are well above pre-pandemic levels), and people are staying unemployed for longer. The median duration of unemployment jumped higher, to 9.8 weeks from 8.9 weeks in May and landed at a level not seen since January 2023, BLS data shows. But what happens if the unemployment rate keeps moving higher? \u201cNow, if we start to get closer to 4.5%, am I going to be a little more concerned? Yes. But I think we have the kind of labor market that we want to see over the longer run.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/economy/june-jobs-report-final/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_05_business_japan-aging-society-baby-care-nhk-dg", "text": "The world\u2019s population is getting older in what the United Nations calls an \u201cirreversible global trend,\u201d driven by longer lives and smaller families. The number of people aged 65 and older is expected to more than double to 1.6 billion globally by 2050, according to a UN report published last year. In Japan, this change is threatening one of the world\u2019s largest economies as the percentage of older people grows and fewer couples have children. In early June, the country said the number of babies born fell for the eighth straight year, hitting a record low of 727,277 births in 2023 since Japan started compiling data more than 120 years ago. A few months earlier, Japan said that one in 10 people were aged 80 or older, making it the oldest country in the world. Last year, almost 30% of the Japanese population was 65 or older. In June 2023, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida unveiled a multi-billion dollar package of measures to encourage families to have more children. Japan is trying to tackle a demographic crisis that could impact pension funding and health care as\u00a0the workforce shrinks and demand from the aging population surges. The growth of the older population is also changing the consumer product market. Demand for adult diapers in Japan has been rising, while the need for baby diapers has fallen. The global market value for adult diapers was pegged at $12.8 billion in 2023, according to market research provider Euromonitor International. It is expected to reach almost $15.5 billion by 2026. In Japan, the adult diaper market stood at $1.7 billion in 2023, and is expected to grow to $1.9 billion in 2026, accounting for more than 12% of the global total. One example of a company adjusting to this shift is Japanese manufacturer Oji Holdings, which announced in March it would stop producing baby diapers for the Japanese market later this year to focus on incontinence products for adults. The company will continue to run its overseas baby diaper business, it said. Their combined baby diaper sales in China, Indonesia and Malaysia have grown despite a slowdown in the domestic market, where the company sold 7.3% more diapers for adults than babies in 2023. Other Japanese companies have already been adjusting to this shift. Electronics giant Panasonic\u00a0has been researching and developing products aimed at the older population since 1990, according to its website. Kitchen appliance manufacturer Zojirushi is offering product features aimed at senior citizens, such as electric teapots that send an email to a registered address when in use so relatives can keep up with the activities of their elderly family members. Japan isn\u2019t the only place in Asia grappling with aging. South Korea, which has the world\u2019s lowest fertility rate, reported a new low of 0.72 babies per woman in 2023, down from 0.78 in 2022. The government is so concerned it has set up a new agency: the Ministry of Low Birth Rate Counter-Planning. Births are also falling in Hong Kong, China, and Taiwan. According to the UN, six Asian countries or territories will place in the top 10 for the largest share of people age 65 or older in 2050, with Hong Kong leading the list. By 2100, Africa is expected to be the only region where senior citizens represent less than 15% of the population.\u00a0Seniors in Europe, Northern America and Latin America and the Caribbean will likely surpass the 30% threshold by then, according to the UN\u2019s forecast. Although Europe and Northern America now have the highest share of older citizens, Northern Africa, Western Asia and sub-Saharan Africa are expected to experience the fastest growth in the number of older people in the next 30 years.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/business/japan-aging-society-baby-care-nhk-dg/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_04_food_gen-z-drinking-trends-alcohol", "text": "Beer and hot dogs are as patriotic as it gets. But cracking open the cooler at your July 4th barbecue, you could be seeing fewer brews, with alternatives like spiked seltzers, canned cocktail and hard teas stealing their real estate. And you can blame the youngs for that: The youngest cohort of legal-aged drinkers from Gen Z, which encompass the ages from 21 to 26, are \u201cdrinking completely different than any other generation we\u2019ve seen before,\u201d according to NIQ\u2019s Kaleigh Theriault. \u201cThey\u2019re relatively new to their drinking and when they are choosing alcohol they are leaning toward those flavor-forward categories,\u201d Theriault, an associate director of beverage alcohol thought leadership at the consumer intelligence company, told CNN. Beverages created by smaller companies are controlling the landscape. E. & J. Gallo Winery\u2019s High Noon dominates the spirit-based cocktail category; White Claw from Mark Anthony Brands remains the top-selling spiked seltzer; and newer entrants, including punchier drinks that mix liquor with an iced tea or lemonade such as Surfside, a two-year-old brand, are rapidly gaining ground. That\u2019s a problem for Big Beer, which is dealing with flat sales, declining volume and a fickle generation of younger drinkers who are completely ditching the bottle or preferring anything but a regular beer. In response, Miller Lite-maker Molson Coors Beverage Company, Modelo-brewer Constellation Brands and heavyweight Anheuser-Busch InBev are among the larger brewers expanding beyond beer and diversifying their portfolio with flavorful concoctions. Fruit, in particular, has been a focus area because \u201cit\u2019s something that the consumer seems to be drawn to right now and they want to drink something really good,\u201d Theriault said. \u201cThose flavors offer that.\u201d Inspiration from TikTok Constellation turned to TikTok for inspiration for its newest beer, which is lightly based on the \u201cCorona Sunrise\u201d cocktail \u2014 a mixture of tequila, a Corona, orange juice, grenadine, plus a splash of lime juice. It has taken off on the video-sharing app, with the most-watched tutorial racking up nearly 14 million views. Since it\u2019s unlawful to sell a beer mixed with a spirit, Corona spun up its own version to hopefully appeal to younger drinkers: the \u201cSunbrew\u00a0Citrus Cerveza,\u201d which is brewed with orange and lime peels and blended with the same\u00a0juices and mixed with a Corona Extra to mirror the sweet flavor of the cocktail counterpart. \u201cThis new brew was created with the flavor-seeking Gen Z audience in mind, a group of drinkers known for their experimentation and mixing,\u201d noted Sa\u00fal Trejo, director of brand marketing at Corona, in a press release. For now, the drink is only available in the northeastern US before possibly expanding nationwide depending on sales. Sunbrew fits into Constellation\u2019s portfolio with a few other Gen Z-angled beverages like Fresca Mixed and its malt-based beverages, Corona Refresca and Modelo Spiked Aguas Frescas, both of which also have fruity flavors and are selling well for the company. TikTok has also influenced Molson Coors for one of its newest boozy beverages called \u201cHappy Thursday.\u201d The shtick? It\u2019s a non-carbonated drink because \u201cbloating that may come from carbonation is considered a top barrier\u201d for younger drinkers and the trend of \u201cdecarbonizing\u201d drinks is blowing up on the app. The \u201csmooth, bubble-free\u201d drink comes in four fruit flavors, including strawberry and black cherry, and also meets another need for Gen Z since it\u2019s low in alcohol content at 4.4% by volume. It also has bright packaging designed to \u201cpop on social media,\u201d the brewer notes. Launched less than three months ago, sales and distribution are both growing and feedback has been \u201cextremely positive\u201d for Happy Thursday, the company said on its blog. The company could shed more light on its sales during its next earnings report in August. Happy Thursday fits into the company\u2019s strategy that began in 2019 when Molson Coors tweaked its name to encompass its growing portfolio of beverages besides beer. That now includes hard iced tea, energy drinks and its Simply Spiked lineup. Last year, it acquired Blue Run Spirits, a cult favorite high-end bourbon and rye whiskey brand, in light of US spirit sales\u00a0surpassing beer sales. \u201cSuppliers, in order to stay relevant, have to evolve and follow where the consumer is trending \u2014 and right now the consumer wants flavor,\u201d NIQ\u2019s Theriault said about their pivots. \u201cInnovation is really important in the alcohol industry and ensuring that innovation is tied to the consumer trends is what\u2019s right for business.\u201d Building \u2018beyond beer\u2019 Canned cocktails and spirits-based beverages have also helped Anheuser-Busch\u2019s bottom line in the US, especially in light of the collapsing sales of Bud Light. Its aptly titled \u201cBeyond Beer\u201d category is currently a $1.5 billion part of its global business and is helping attract younger, legally aged drinkers. N\u00dcTRL, a flavorful lineup of vodka seltzers, and Cutwater Spirits canned cocktails are two standouts. An Anheuser-Busch spokesperson told CNN that Cutwater, which has a collection of canned rum mai tais, vodka mules and tequila palomas, has \u201csteadily grown dollar sales double digits for five consecutive years\u201d and jumped an additional 23% in sales this year. Still, it\u2019s not all rosy for Anheuser-Busch, especially if a drink has the Bud Light name attached. Bud Light Seltzer sales are down 50%, according to trade publication Brewbound, outpacing a larger decline in malt-based seltzers as drinkers shift toward spirit-based drinks. The company launched a new advertising campaign in 2023 just a few weeks before the Dylan Mulvaney controversy derailed its parent brand\u2019s sales. Despite younger drinkers\u2019 hesitance with buying beer and flat sales, Big Beer companies aren\u2019t facing an existential threat. In fact, it\u2019s the exact opposite, according to one expert. \u201cYoung drinkers can now find just about any kind of drink in just about any kind of flavor practically whenever they want, and they get to choose from the most diverse collection of beverages that has ever existed \u2014 with and without alcohol,\u201d Bryan Roth, an analyst for Feel Goods Company and editor of the alcohol beverage newsletter, Sightlines+, told\u00a0CNN. \u201cThese long-tenured and often historic companies are adapting to the market. What makes it particularly exciting is that consumers are more often leading the way,\u201d he added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/food/gen-z-drinking-trends-alcohol/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "business"}}

Americans feeding a group of 10 this holiday weekend will spend an average of $71.22, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation. It\u2019s a record high: 5% more than last year and 30% higher than in 2019 before the Covid-19 pandemic. The biggest driver of the pricier supermarket bills will be the cost of meat, which accounts for about half the total cost. The American Farm Bureau found the price of two pounds of ground beef will cost an average of $12.77 this year, up 11% from a year ago. Pork is also more expensive, increasing 8% to an average of $15.49. Some cookout items are cheaper The good news is that some items are cheaper than last summer. For instance, two pounds of chicken breasts now cost an average of $7.83 nationally, down 4% from a year ago. Likewise, the cost of homemade potato salad dipped 4%. The price of other staples including cheese (+1%) and strawberries (+1%) barely budged. Zooming out, it\u2019s clear that food prices are no longer skyrocketing like they were two years ago. As inflation skyrocketed across the economy in 2022, the American Farm Bureau estimated a 17% year-over-year spike in the cost of a Fourth of July cookout. In that survey, the cost of ground beef had surged 36% over the year. And the cost of chicken breast climbed 33% amid outbreaks of bird flu, which also sent egg prices skyrocketing. After that sticker shock, Fourth of July grillers got a break on the bill last summer. The cost of a 10-person cookout dipped 3% to $67.73. The American Farm Bureau notes that, on an inflation-adjusted basis, this summer\u2019s BBQ bill is 5% lower than the record set in 2022. \ufeffGovernment data shows food inflation has eased substantially. Grocery prices increased just 1% in May from the year earlier, compared with a peak of nearly 6% in June 2023, according to the\u00a0Bureau of Labor Statistics. Of course, grocery prices differ significantly across the country. The cheapest Fourth of July barbecue bill is in the Northeast at $63.54, according to the American Farm Bureau. Consumers will spend a bit more in the South and the Midwest, at $68.33 and $68.26, respectively. The most expensive barbecue bills are in the West, where Americans will spend $80.88, or more than $1 higher per person than the national average.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/food/fourth-of-july-bbq-inflation-prices/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "business"}}

However, it\u2019s clear that there is something different about Dex; she\u2019s an entirely virtual \u201cdigital human,\u201d designed by a startup in the UK. For her performances, Dex is displayed on a video screen or as a holographic projection, with her mixes created by humans. She is animated using Unreal Engine \u2014 a 3D modeling software widely used in video games \u2014 combined with motion-capture. Generative artificial intelligence allows her to remember information and respond to questions, using a voice also generated by AI. \u201cShe\u2019s probably one of the only digital humans in the performance space that you can have a conversation and interact with,\u201d says Denise Harris, CCO of startup Sum Vivas. \u201cYou can ask her anything. She is a genius about music.\u201d Last month, Dex performed at Digital Fashion Weeks in New York, Paris and Milan, and she has modeled outfits by Prada and Louis Vuitton at digital fashion events.

According to CEO and founder Rob Sims, digital humans can help bridge the gap between AI technology and people. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve found is when people start working with and conversing with a digital human, they very quickly suspend disbelief,\u201d Sims tells CNN. \u201cIt becomes natural.\u201d AI explosion Since OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT was launched in November 2022, considerable hype has surrounded the potential of generative AI \u2014 artificial intelligence powered by huge datasets of information, capable of generating text outputs in a conversational way. Record levels of investment into generative AI have followed, with over $21 billion poured into the industry during the first nine months of last year, according to data insights company Pitchbook. In March 2023, Google launched Bard (recently renamed Gemini) and around the same time Anthropic released its AI assistant Claude. As generative AI chatbots become increasingly ubiquitous, Sum Vivas is one of several companies looking to make them more human. US and New Zealand-based UneeQ has developed animated conversational \u201cdigital humans\u201d that can be used as virtual sales reps and customer service agents on company websites, and this month it debuted Sama 2.0, an animated cabin crew member that answers questions on Qatar Airways\u2019 website and app. Microsoft recently announced that users of its Azure software would be able to create lifelike avatars capable of turning text prompts into animated speech.

{"id": "2023_11_21_opinions_sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic", "text": "The biggest tech news this week is the\u00a0ouster\u00a0of Sam Altman from his role as CEO of OpenAI, a move that has shaken the company and the industry. Hundreds of OpenAI employees have threatened to\u00a0resign. Altman has already\u00a0moved on\u00a0to a role at Microsoft. And OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is on its\u00a0third CEO\u00a0in as many days. It\u2019s all very juicy. But this drama should also be raising larger questions, far beyond one company\u2019s internal hirings and firings, including: Who are the people making the decisions\u00a0that will determine so much of our technological future? What guiding principles are they using to make those decisions? And how should other institutions \u2013 governments, non-tech industries, global alliances, regulatory bodies \u2013 reign in the worst excesses of potentially dangerous AI innovators? OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, with an explicit mission to harness what may soon be superhuman intelligence \u201cto benefit humanity as a whole.\u201d But that sensibility hasn\u2019t lasted. The company now has a multi-billion-dollar for-profit arm. They have been developing new technologies at lightning speed, and sometimes sending them out to the public\u00a0before some employees believed they were ready. The company has already reportedly invented an AI technology so dangerous they will never release it \u2013 but they also\u00a0won\u2019t tell\u00a0reporters or the public exactly what it is. This dynamic \u2013 a potentially dangerous technology developed at extreme speed, largely behind closed doors \u2013 is partly to blame for Altman\u2019s firing. The OpenAI board, according to\u00a0CNN\u2019s David Goldman, worried that \u201cthe company was making the technological equivalent of a nuclear bomb, and its caretaker, Sam Altman, was moving so fast that he risked a global catastrophe.\u201d At particular issue seemed to be Altman\u2019s efforts to make the tools behind ChatGPT available to anyone who wanted to make their own version of the chatbot. This could be widely disastrous, some board members worried. But then they fired him without warning, and apparently without involving Microsoft, the company\u2019s largest shareholder. Now, Altman is at the new AI group at Microsoft, and one has to wonder if the oversight and caution there will be on par with that at OpenAI, or if he\u2019ll be handed carte blanche to push as fast and hard as he wants. And for all the justified reticence of the OpenAI board, the company has carried out much of its work in secrecy \u2013 without the public really understanding what a handful of unaccountable technologists are building, and how it is nearly guaranteed to indelibly change their lives. AI is broadly understood to have the potential to reshape vast swaths of human existence. At the very least, it seems nearly guaranteed to change how we process information, how we communicate, how we learn and how we work (and if we work). And the ramifications could be much more extreme. AI technologies have already demonstrated the ability\u00a0to lie and to cover their tracks. They have already been able to\u00a0suggest the design\u00a0to make a virus spread more quickly. Many researchers\u00a0acutely understand\u00a0just how quickly these machines could develop the capacity to annihilate us, including Altman: He has a prepper\u2019s paradise prepared in Big Sur, complete with guns and \u201cgas masks from the Israeli Defense Force\u201d in case AI goes off the rails and the robots go to war against humans,\u00a0according to reporting in the New Yorker. But don\u2019t worry, he told an Atlantic reporter: If AI is determined to wipe us out, \u201cno gas mask is helping anyone.\u201d (If you want an excellent and terrifying rundown of AI\u2019s risks \u2013 at least those we understand right now, which are almost certainly a mere sliver of the looming perils \u2013\u00a0the Atlantic profile of Altman and his technology\u00a0is worth a read). AI is very exciting technology. But it is also a potentially very dangerous one, and not in the social media sense of \u201cit may give us bad self-esteem and make us lonelier\u201d but in the sense of \u201cit could break down human societies and kill us all.\u201d Given the life-altering potential of AI \u2013 that even if it doesn\u2019t kill us all, it will almost certainly change human existence in unprecedented ways at unprecedented speed \u2013 we all have a stake in how it\u2019s being developed. And yet the development is being left to a handful of people (who seem to be\u00a0largely\u00a0men) in Silicon Valley, and other tech pockets around the globe. And we all have a stake in whose interests AI will serve \u2013 and right now, its development is being funded with billions of dollars by people expecting to make a huge profit. Do the interests of the public align with the interests of the shareholders to whom profit-driven, potentially tremendously lucrative-for-a-few companies are beholden? Or with the interests of tech entrepreneurs who are primarily excited about being at the forefront of the AI revolution, regardless of the potential human costs? One thing is clear: AI is coming. And how it is built and unleashed on the public matters more than perhaps any technology of the past century. It is, indeed, up there with the atom bomb in its destructive potential \u2013 except likely more difficult to regulate and control. \u201cRegulation\u201d does not begin to scratch the surface of what\u2019s needed to make sure that the AI future is not a catastrophic one, especially since the development of AI is now a massive international arms race, with particularly horrific implications if bad actors develop this technology first. But regulation is, at minimum, a necessary step. So is transparency: In the US, companies have wide leverage to work behind a veil of secrecy, and much of what AI companies do is kept secret to stymy competition. But the public certainly has a right to understand what life-altering technologies are set to be inflicted upon us, and what the creators are doing to protect humanity \u2013 our jobs, our communities, our families, our connections, our educations and our abilities to build a life of purpose, but also our lives and our safety. The Altman story is fascinating because Altman is the most powerful figure in AI technology, which in effect makes him one of the most powerful men in the world. But that should give us pause: Who is he, what power does he hold, what is he doing with it, who does he answer to, and are we comfortable with this much life-altering potential being held by a few unaccountable people?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/21/opinions/sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_03_tech_google-ai-greenhouse-gas-emissions-environmental-impact", "text": "As Google has rushed to incorporate artificial intelligence into its core products \u2014 with sometimes less-than-stellar results \u2014 a problem has been brewing behind the scenes: the systems needed to power its AI tools have vastly increased the company\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. AI systems need lots of computers to make them work. The data centers needed to run them, essentially warehouses full of powerful computing equipment, suck up tons of energy to process data and manage the heat all of those computers produce. The end result has been that Google\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions have soared 48% since 2019, according to the tech giant\u2019s annual environment report. The tech giant blamed that growth mainly on \u201cincreased data center energy consumption and supply chain emissions.\u201d Now, Google is calling its goal to reach net-zero emissions by 2030 \u201cextremely ambitious,\u201d and said the pledge is likely to be affected by \u201cthe uncertainty around the future environmental impact of AI, which is complex and difficult to predict.\u201d In other words: a sustainability push by the company \u2014 which once included the slogan \u201cdon\u2019t be evil\u201d in its code of conduct \u2014 has gotten more complicated thanks to AI. Google, like other tech rivals, has gone all-in on investing in AI, which is widely seen as the next major tech revolution that\u2019s poised to change how we live, work and consume information. The company has integrated its Gemini generative AI technology into some of its core products, including Search and Google Assistant, and CEO Sundar Pichai has called Google an \u201cAI-first company.\u201d But AI comes with a major downside: the power-hungry data centers that Google and other Big Tech rivals are currently spending tens of billions of dollars each quarter to expand in order to fuel their AI ambitions. Illustrating just how much more demanding AI models are than traditional computing systems, the International Energy Agency estimates that a Google search query requires 0.3 watt-hours of electricity on average, while a ChatGPT request typically consumes about 2.9 watt-hours. An October\u00a0study\u00a0from Dutch researcher Alex de Vries estimated that the \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d suggests Google\u2019s AI systems could eventually consume as much electricity as the country of Ireland each year, assuming a full-scale adoption of AI in their current hardware and software. \u201cAs we further integrate AI into our products, reducing emissions may be challenging due to increasing energy demands from the greater intensity of AI compute, and the emissions associated with the expected increases in our technical infrastructure investment,\u201d Google said in its report, published Monday. It added that data center electricity consumption is currently growing faster than it can bring carbon-free electricity sources online. Google said it expects its total greenhouse gas emissions to continue to rise before falling, as the company seeks to invest in clean energy sources, such as wind and geothermal energy, to power its data centers. The large amounts of water used as coolant needed to prevent data centers from overheating also presents a sustainability challenge. Google says it aims to replenish 120% of the freshwater it consumes in its offices and data centers by 2030; last year, it replenished just 18% of that water, although the amount was up sharply from 6% the year prior. Google is also among companies experimenting with ways to use AI to fight climate change. A 2019 Google DeepMind project, for example, trained an AI model on weather forecasts and historical wind turbine data to predict the availability of wind power, helping to increase the value of the renewable energy source for wind farmers. The company has also used AI to suggest more fuel-efficient routes to drivers using Google Maps. \u201cWe know that scaling AI and using it to accelerate climate action is just as crucial as addressing the environmental impact associated with it,\u201d Google said in the report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/tech/google-ai-greenhouse-gas-emissions-environmental-impact/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "business"}}

Harper says Tractor Supply\u2019s inclusion policies should have been attuned to that specific cultural context. \u201cYou can\u2019t say you\u2019re going to try to do at Tractor Supply what they do at the Apple headquarters in Cupertino, California \u2014 that\u2019s definitely not going to work,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s what I call \u2018situated DEI.\u2019 I would say start with an emphasis on expanding opportunities for low income people, expanding access to farming for women in rural contexts, and helping people understand how more women and more people of color in the farming industry benefits everyone. And helping them understand that the diversification of the farming industry, with women and people of color doesn\u2019t necessarily have to entail a reduction and opportunities for White male farmers.\u201d Still, activists and experts say Tractor Supply\u2019s backtrack is a blow against civil rights and LGBTQ+ protections for employees and customers. \u201cHomophobia, transphobia, sexism, gender discrimination, workplace sexual harassment, ableism, size-ism and racism are not going to eliminate themselves,\u201d said Harper. \u201cIn the absence of good policy and programs within companies, the danger is that those long-standing problems are going to become exacerbated. There\u2019s going to be more conflict between and among employees, and customers who represent various diverse groups.\u201d Tractor Supply also said it would \u201cno longer submit data to the Human Rights Campaign,\u201d one of the biggest LGBTQ+ non-profit advocacy groups in the United States. It was one of more than 1,300 businesses to participate in the HRC\u2019s Corporate Equality Index, a benchmarking survey and report measuring policies and practices relating to LGBTQ+ workplace equality. In 2023, the company earned a near-perfect score of 95/100 for instating workplace protections and benefits taking LGBTQ+ employees into account, providing inclusivity training to workers, and performing outreach to the LGBTQ+ community. \u201cTractor Supply Co is turning its back on their own neighbors with this shortsighted decision,\u201d Eric Bloem, vice president of Programs and Corporate Advocacy at the Human Rights Campaign, told CNN in a statement Saturday. \u201cLGBTQ+ people live in every zip code in this country, including rural communities. We are shoppers, farmers, veterans and agriculture students. Companies from every industry work closely with us to be sure their employees and customers are respected, valued and can get the job done for their workforce and shareholders. This is why the Tractor Supply \u2014 and most of the country\u2019s biggest employers \u2014 have worked with us for years to create inclusive policies and practices. Caving to far right extremists is only going to hurt the same folks that these businesses rely on.\u201d A trend of bowing to anti-LGBTQ+ voices The policy reversal is part of a wider trend of corporate vacillation over LGBTQ+ inclusion. In the face of anti-LGBTQ backlash threatening companies\u2019 bottom line, several household brands have backed down in their support of inclusivity. Last year, Bud Light\u2019s partnership with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney sparked an anti-trans backlash and a monthslong boycott of the beer brand, throughout which the company failed to take a firm stance in support of Mulvaney and the transgender community. The boycott and the subsequent tepid response lost parent company Anheuser-Busch InBev as much as $1.4 billion in sales, as well as its credibility with a major LGBTQ+ non-profit. Last month, retailer Target said it will limit how many stores would carry its Pride-themed collection for adults after a boycott from right-wing activists last summer led to a sharp dip in sales. While bowing to consumer backlash might seem like the safest strategy to claw back revenue lost in a boycott, it can also be shortsighted. Harper argues few companies consider the potential cost of litigation from customers and employees. \u201cSo much money gets wasted on settlements or damages for discrimination and harassment,\u201d he said. \u201cI want companies to not just think about sales, but also about the cost of litigation, as well as the reputational costs. Those are the parts that business leaders aren\u2019t thinking about as they are folding on DEI.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/29/business/tractor-supply-dei-roles-goals/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_29_business_lego-most-stolen-items", "text": "Lego\u2019s fanbase, which famously cuts across kids, teenagers and grownup collectors, is seeing some unsavory characters break into the mix, and for all the wrong reasons. Lego products, especially the pricier sets that range from over $100 to $1,000 or more, are being targeted for theft both by individual shoplifters and larger organized retail crime rings who make a beeline for sets sitting on store shelves because they can fetch a good profit at resale both in legal and illegal channels. Miguel Zuniga, who operates a Bricks & Minifigs Lego resale franchise store in Lumita, Los Angeles County, is still dealing with a break-in on June 18. The Lego heist happened around 5 am that Tuesday morning. \u201cI was asleep, and the ADT security system gave me a call. Then my wife got a call. I went straight to the cameras and saw we were being robbed,\u201d Zuniga told CNN. He got to his store within 10 minutes, but the burglars were gone \u2013 with about $5,000 to $7,000 of Legos, he estimates. Retail crime experts told CNN that stolen Lego sets are easy to resell, they\u2019re typically hard to trace and they can fetch close to the original retail price if in mint condition and unused. Even used sets in decent shape can go for 50% of the original price. In recent months, robbers have stolen Legos in several states. Earlier this month, police in California arrested two people in connection with a retail theft ring that allegedly stole thousands of Lego toys from several Southern California retailers, according to CNN affiliate KABC. LAPD detectives recovered more than 2,800 boxes of Lego toys with retail value of $20 to over $1,000 per item, the report quoted a police statement as saying. In Philadelphia, police logged a series of Lego set thefts in recent months at retailers such as Barnes & Noble and Target, with stolen sets valued from $250 to up to $1,000 each. Target told CNN it did not have any information to share on Lego thefts at its stores. Barnes & Noble did not immediately respond to a request for comment. And north of the border, in Richmond, British Columbia, police in March seized a haul of more than 1,000 stolen toys. Among the stolen goods were more than $150,000 worth of Lego sets and other plush toys. Among the most stolen products Although hard data is difficult to come by, experts said Lego sets are routinely among the top 10 most stolen retail products, along with branded denim, handbags, designer shoes, Olay skincare and Apple products. \u201cLego is unique. The brand is always refreshing their offerings, always on trend with tie-ins to pop culture and special edition sets,\u201d said Read Hayes, a criminologist at the University of Florida and the director of the Loss Prevention Research Council, whose members include Walmart, Target, Home Depot and Gap. Hayes told CNN his team works with a majority of retailers that carry Lego products as well as Legoland theme parks. \u201cDemand is always there.\u201d As a result, there\u2019s not only a market for stolen Lego products but also a burgeoning counterfeit market, especially online. Casey Slaughter, a captain with the Wichita, Kansas, police department who heads its property crimes bureau, is very familiar with Lego offenses. \u201cWe see Lego toys as one of the more frequently stolen items in our area,\u201d Slaughter told CNN. \u201cAny retailer selling the brand is susceptible to Lego theft, but we also have a couple of Lego-specific secondhand stores that have popped up as resellers. They\u2019re being targeted.\u201d It\u2019s easy money for Lego thieves, he said. \u201cThey\u2019re difficult to track where they were stolen from,\u201d he said. Between January 8, 2024 and May 7, 2024, Wichita Police investigated 19 Lego thefts, according to data the police department provided to CNN. Thefts included sets based on Star Wars, Indiana Jones and Back to the Future films, the data indicated. When reached for comment, Lego directed CNN to online resources on its website to educate consumers how to spot fake online Lego stores and fake Lego products. In California, several Bricks & Minifigs stores have been robbed since April. \u201cThis is probably our fourth or fifth hit that deals mainly with Legos. They happen quickly, 30 seconds to a minute,\u201d Captain Calvin Mah with the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department\u2019s major crimes bureau said in an interview with CNN, referring to the robbery at Zuniga\u2019s store. \u201cIn watching the surveillance video, I could see them targeting specific Lego sets. They knew exactly what they were looking for. They wanted the high-end and high-value sets, the rare or collectible ones,\u201d he said. Zuniga got emotional when speaking about the robbery to CNN. After cleaning his store the day of the burglary, Zuniga went home to shower. \u201cWhen I came back I sent a bat signal to the community to come and support us in our time of need,\u201d he said. Customers came, some even donating their Lego sets. He bought Lego sets that were on sale at the local Target to fill up empty shelves. \u201cAt 9 am, the first customer that came was a 71-year-old who has built some of the most expensive Lego sets,\u201d Zuniga recounted, his own voice cracking as he sobbed. \u201cHe\u2019s our local legend. He showed up in tears.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/29/business/lego-most-stolen-items/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_03_business_noncompete-clause-federal-judge-ruling", "text": "A federal judge on Wednesday preliminarily delayed a ban on noncompete agreements from taking effect for a handful of employers on September 4. Unless the judge makes another ruling to the contrary before that date, the ban on noncompete agreements will go into effect for the majority of companies in the US. But they will learn later this summer if that still holds.  \u201cWhile this order is preliminary, the Court intends to rule on the ultimate merits of this action on or before August 30, 2024,\u201d wrote Judge Ada Brown of the US District Court for the Northern District of Texas. There is likely to be a concerted effort between now and the end of August to persuade the judge to block the ban nationwide, according to Jesse Coleman, a partner at the law firm Seyfarth Shaw in Houston, which represents SHRM, a human resource management association. The ban, which prohibits employers from enforcing noncompete clauses in most existing employment agreements and bans companies from including them in all future ones, was approved by the Federal Trade Commission in April. Within a day of the FTC approval, the agency was sued by Ryan LLC, a tax services and software provider based in Texas, and, separately, by the US Chamber of Commerce and other business groups. Wednesday\u2019s order limits the preliminary injunction to just the plaintiff (Ryan LLC) and the plaintiffs-intervenors, which are the US Chamber of Commerce, the Business Roundtable, the Texas Association of Business and the Longview Chamber of Commerce. However, it doesn\u2019t extend to the member companies of those groups. \u201c[T]he Court declines to extend injunctive relief to members of Plaintiff-Intervenors,\u201d the judge wrote. Even though the court indicates that it believes the FTC lacks the rulemaking authority to issue a noncompete ban, the judge declined to issue a nationwide ban for now, Coleman said.  Part of the reason, according to the order, appears to be that the plaintiffs-intervenors did not sufficiently brief the court on why a ban should be applied more widely. The FTC estimates that 30 million people \u2014 one in five US workers \u2014 are bound by a noncompete clause in their current jobs. For most of them, the agency asserts that such a clause restricts them from freely switching jobs, lowers wages, stifles innovation, blocks entrepreneurs from starting new businesses and undermines fair competition. The US Chamber of Commerce, in a statement, characterized the limited preliminary injunction as a win. \u201cThe FTC\u2019s blanket ban on noncompetes is an unlawful power grab that defies the agency\u2019s constitutional and statutory authority and sets a dangerous precedent where the government knows better than the markets. The U.S. Chamber will continue to hold the FTC accountable in court,\u201d said the group\u2019s chief counsel Daryl Joseffer. In response to the order, FTC spokesperson Douglas Farrar said, \u201cThe FTC stands by our clear authority, supported by statute and precedent, to issue this rule. We will keep fighting to free hardworking Americans from unlawful noncompetes, which reduce innovation, inhibit economic growth, trap workers, and undermine Americans\u2019 economic liberty.\u201d In the meantime, the court\u2019s order does not preclude the FTC from taking enforcement actions against noncompete agreements on a case-by-case basis.

{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl", "text": "Sam Altman has agreed to return to lead OpenAI, the company said in a Tuesday post on X, just days after his surprise ouster as chief executive sparked an employee revolt that threatened to undermine what has been the leading company in the fledgling artificial intelligence industry. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman wrote that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft, which is the ChatGPT maker\u2019s biggest financial backer. The announcement appears to bring to an end days of chaos for the AI industry that included negotiations over who should lead OpenAI and how the firm should be run, as well as broader discussions about just how fast the arms race to develop AI technology should be moving. The details of Altman\u2019s firing and re-hiring remain murky. In its announcement Friday, OpenAI claimed that Altman had been insufficiently \u201ccandid\u201d with the board. That ambiguous language sent the rumor mill flying. But a key factor in Altman\u2019s ouster was the presence of\u00a0tensions between Altman, who favored pushing AI development more aggressively, and members of the original OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the crisis. As of Monday morning, Nadella had announced that Altman, along with fellow OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, would be joining Microsoft to lead a new AI research division. OpenAI said it had hired former Twitch chief Emmett Shear as interim CEO. But then hundreds of OpenAI employees, nearly the company\u2019s entire staff, threatened to leave, potentially for Microsoft, if the company\u2019s board didn\u2019t resign and reinstate Altman as CEO. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it invested billions in to help bolster its ambitions in developing AI, which many in Silicon Valley think will be the most important wave of technological advancement in the coming decades. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Microsoft CEO\u00a0Satya Nadella said on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d Altman\u2019s vision to quickly roll out and commercialize AI tools also appears to have won out. Publicly, Altman has long cautioned about risks posed by AI, and he\u202fhas pledged to lawmakers and customers that he would move OpenAI forward responsibly. \u201cIs [AI] gonna be like the printing press that diffused knowledge, power and learning widely across the landscape that empowered ordinary, everyday individuals that led to greater flourishing, that led above all to greater liberty?\u201d he said in a May Senate subcommittee hearing pressing for regulation. \u201cOr is it gonna be more like the atom bomb \u2014 huge technological breakthrough, but the consequences (severe, terrible) continue to haunt us to this day?\u201d But inside the company, Altman had been pushing to bring products to market more quickly and to sell them for a profit. Altman announced a few weeks ago at OpenAI\u2019s first-ever developer day that the company would make tools available so anyone could create their own version of ChatGPT. OpenAI has also worked with Microsoft to roll out ChatGPT-like technology across Microsoft\u2019s products. OpenAI and iPhone designer Jony Ive had also reportedly\u202fbeen in talks to raise $1 billion from Japanese conglomerate SoftBank for an AI device to replace the smartphone. \u2014 CNN\u2019s Juliana Liu and Diksha Madhok contributed reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_04_business_heat-keep-your-power-bill-down", "text": "Emma Corrado tries to be conscious of her electricity usage, both as an aspiring biosystems engineer with a focus on natural resources and a self-proclaimed \u201cbroke college student\u201d at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. But on the tail of a record-breaking heatwave that swept the Midwest and Northeast, she\u2019s finding it difficult to keep costs down. Corrado told CNN that the power bill for the two-bedroom apartment she shares with a roommate in Madison, Wisconsin, usually averages about $21 a month. Come summer, it spikes to $100\u2014 a jump she attributes to the cost of air conditioning. To escape the sweltering temperatures, Corrado seeks refuge at her workplace rather than keeping the air conditioner running at home. \u201cI have the option to work remotely, but I tend not to because the building we work in has really good AC,\u201d she said. Americans\u2019 power bills are expected to soar this summer, as heat waves have already begun baking parts of the country. But experts say there are ways to keep cool without breaking the bank \u2013 or at least to limit how much you\u2019re shelling out each month. Be strategic with your temperature setting Do use your air conditioner or other systems to keep cool. \u201cHeat is the number one weather-related killer,\u201d said Annie Carforo, climate justice campaigns manager for WE ACT for Environmental Justice, a community activist group. Carforo cited New York City\u2019s 2024 Heat-Related Mortality Report, which found that the most likely location for heat-related deaths was inside homes that had no AC or had an AC that was not in use. But be mindful of the temperature to which you set your air conditioner. \u201cWe advise people to set your air conditioner to the highest temperature that you\u2019re comfortable with,\u201d said Jamie McShane, director of media relations for New York-based energy company Con Edison. \u201cEvery degree that you increase the thermostat lowers your cost.\u201d Carforo says that some Americans are keeping their air conditioners off entirely when they head out for the day. But keeping your AC off when you\u2019re not home may actually result in higher bills later on. According to the Department of Energy, the smaller the difference between the temperatures inside and outside your home, the lower your overall cooling bill will be. The department says that setting your thermostat to a colder setting when you first turn on your AC may result in unnecessary expenses as it forces your AC to work harder to offset the outside heat. For this reason, it recommends equipping your home with a programmable thermostat that can adjust the temperature according to a preset schedule. \u201cYou can keep (your temperature) up to 78 and still be perfectly safe,\u201d said Mark Wolfe, the executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association, but he advises against making the change abruptly. Instead, he recommends gradually upping the thermostat by one degree every couple of days to acclimate to the new temperature. Invest in your home\u2019s energy efficiency Wolfe anticipates that Americans may need to spend more on their electricity bill as climate change makes for hotter Septembers. One long-term solution is making sure your home\u2019s cooling system is up to date. \u201cEspecially if it\u2019s an old system, replacing it might be the better strategy than fixing it,\u201d he said. One way to gauge your cooling system\u2019s efficiency is by looking at your AC unit\u2019s seasonal energy efficiency ratio, or SEER rating. A higher rating indicates lower energy consumption levels and, in turn, lower costs of cooling. Upgrading from a SEER 10 unit to a SEER 14 could cut costs by 20%. But overhauling an existing cooling system can be pricey. That\u2019s why Wolfe encourages getting in touch with your local utility provider and taking advantage of available rebate programs. \u201cSome of these rebate programs are better than others, but they all make a difference. They all want to encourage you to make these improvements,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you buy a high efficiency furnace, if you buy a heat pump, if you install insulation, they provide subsidies to help you do that.\u201d McShane pointed to Con Edison\u2019s own residential rebate programs, which offer New Yorkers living in the Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens and Westchester up to $4,000 to get insulation professionally installed. \u201cYou can rail against it, but you can\u2019t stop it. Temperatures are continuing to rise,\u201d Wolfe said. \u201cWhat we can do is look at how we use energy and manage it better.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/business/heat-keep-your-power-bill-down/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_01_business_australia-vaping-laws-ban-intl-hnk", "text": "Buying a vape just got harder in Australia with the introduction of some of the world\u2019s toughest anti-vaping laws that limit the sale of vapes with nicotine to pharmacies. From Monday, users will need to present a doctor\u2019s prescription to a pharmacist to buy vapes, and the choice will be limited to three flavors: mint, menthol and tobacco. Dozens of countries have banned disposable vapes, but with the ban on vape sales in shops, service stations and other small retailers, Australia has introduced \u201cworld leading\u201d laws, according to the government. Australian authorities say the move spells the end of colorful branding and fun flavors that authorities say was a ploy to get children hooked on nicotine. \u201cIt\u2019s not often that the parliament gets the opportunity to do something really meaningful and lasting for the health of young Australians,\u201d said Health Minister Mark Butler, after the country\u2019s parliament passed\u00a0the laws. However, under a political deal that was struck to secure the law\u2019s approval, the restrictions will ease in October, when only minors under 18 will need a prescription. Adults will be able to buy vapes in pharmacies, without a prescription \u2013 but the devices may be hard to find after some leading pharmacy chains declared they would refuse to stock them. \u201cPharmacists are healthcare professionals and community pharmacies do not want to supply this potentially harmful, highly addictive product without a prescription,\u201d said Anthony Tassone, the national vice president of the Pharmacy Guild of Australia, which represents over 5,900 community pharmacies nationwide. Fears of a growing black market Australia\u2019s Greens Party had pushed for the amendments to allow\u00a0adults to buy vapes without a prescription because they do not support prohibition or the criminalization of vaping. \u201cThe prohibition of drugs has failed. The Greens are pleased that we have secured amendments to this legislation that will ensure that no person will be criminalised for personal possession of a vaping product,\u201d Greens Senator Jordon Steele-John said in a statement. It\u2019s not a criminal offense to possess vapes for personal use, but the import and sale of commercial quantities of vapes will attract large fines. Some fear the new laws will create a black market for vapes, much like one that exists for cigarettes in Australia, which imposes some of the highest tobacco taxes in the world. A box of 20 cigarettes costs around 35 Australian dollars ($23) \u2013 considerably more than in the United States and the United Kingdom. And the costs are expected to rise when the tobacco tax increases by another 5%\u00a0in September. Despite the rising cost of cigarettes, some fear that young vapers \u2013 having been locked out of the vape market \u2013 will turn to cigarettes to get their nicotine fix. \u201cThe reality at the moment is that vapes are actually still cheaper, but with the change in legislation that uncertainty, may be making them think, \u2018Well, I won\u2019t be able to get it. Maybe I\u2019ll move back to smoking, or maybe I\u2019ll start smoking,\u2019\u201d Hester Wilson, an addiction expert at the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners told national broadcaster, the ABC. Other countries are grappling with a rise in young people taking up vaping, but they\u2019re adopting various approaches to the issue. In June, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the first non-tobacco-flavored e-cigarette products, drawing harsh criticism from pediatricians and anti-tobacco groups.  The FDA also paired with the Justice Department to create a task force to identify and target illegal sales and distribution of e-cigarettes in the US.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/business/australia-vaping-laws-ban-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "business"}}

Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment (CSSE) revealed in a filing that it has nearly $1 billion in debt and owes millions of dollars to several entertainment companies including the BBC and Sony Pictures, plus to retailers ranging from Walmart to Walgreens. Filings show that the company took on about $325 million in debt following its purchase of Redbox in 2022 from private equity giant Apollo Global Management. The plan was to make it into an entertainment conglomerate, combining the DVD rental business with its free streaming services, like Crackle, the entertainment platform once owned by Sony. Those plans didn\u2019t pan out, hindered by dual Hollywood strikes that limited production of fresh content and the decline of people renting physical DVDs that even forced rival Netflix to quit that part of its business last year. CSSE declined to comment. Deadline previously reported that Redbox hadn\u2019t paid employees for a week, and medical benefits have been suspended.
