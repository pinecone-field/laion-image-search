{"id": "2022_04_27_business_diamonds-manmade-demand", "text": "It\u2019s proposal season, and engagements are on the rise. So are factory-made diamond sales. Not that you\u2019d know the difference. Man-made diamonds look the same as naturally occurring ones. The only noticeable difference is the price tag. \u201cThe result is really stunning,\u201d said Edahn Golan, an independent diamond industry analyst. He said March data showed the number of engagement rings sold that featured a manufactured diamond jumped 63% compared to last year, while the number of engagement rings sold with a natural diamond declined 25% in the same period. Going back by another month, to February, the data showed the number of rings sold with lab diamonds that month surged even more, to 80% compared to a year earlier while the number fell by 13% for natural diamond engagement rings.  \u201cThe big fear in the natural diamonds industry is that consumers will start accepting lab-grown diamonds in engagement rings,\u201d he said. Too late. \u201cIt\u2019s actually happening.\u201d  Tide is shifting Why are consumers flocking to man-made diamonds? Cost is the most obvious reason. The average retail price of the most popular one carat round man-made diamond for an engagement ring in March was $2,318, Golan said. \u201cThis is substantially less \u2013 as much as 73% cheaper \u2013 than a natural diamond of the same size, cut and clarity as the man-made diamond, which would cost $8,740,\u201d he said. Plus, the lower cost allows couples to buy a bigger stone.  \u201cA lab diamond is a real diamond, but maybe it took a few weeks to make it,\u201d said Golan. \u201cNatural diamonds were formed over 800 million to three billion years and there isn\u2019t an infinite supply of them.\u201d  This makes natural diamonds quite a bit more expensive, and prices are likely to rise as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has tightened the supply chain for natural raw diamonds. The sanctions directly target Alrosa, partly owned by the Russian government, which the US government identified as the world\u2019s largest diamond mining company, accounting for 28% of global diamond output. Man-made diamonds are also becoming popular as consumers are more aware and educated about them, said Dan Moran, a third-generation diamond expert and owner of LA-based fine jeweler Concierge Diamonds. Moran said the typical buyer of man-made diamonds is typically younger than 40 and very budget conscious. Mined diamonds have a controversial history that\u2019s tied to the use of child labor in some African diamond mines as well as sales of illegally-traded \u201cconflict diamonds\u201d that fund conflict in war-torn areas. Among Millennials and Gen Z, their eco-conscious mindset and ethical concerns about natural diamond sourcing is another factor influencing their preference for non-traditional engagement rings, according to a report from wedding planning website The Knot. Small but growing share of the diamond market Although its slice is growing, the market share for man-made diamonds remains relatively small. Currently, about 7% of the specialty diamond jewelry market is represented by man-made diamonds, up from 3% in 2020, said Golan.  Some major jewelry retailers are driving the effort to take man-made diamonds mainstream. In 2021, the world\u2019s largest jewelry company, Pandora\n            \n                (PANDY), made a major shift by announcing it would stop using mined diamonds and would swap to lab-created diamonds in its jewelry.  Pandora said it\u2019s instituting the change as part of an effort to sell sustainable jewelry, and also because consumers increasingly are asking for it. Signet,\n            \n                (SIG) the largest jewelry company in the United States (which owns Zales, Kay Jewelers and Jared chains) called out the popularity of lab diamond jewelry in its March earnings call with analysts. Calling it a \u201cfast-growing category\u201d in its jewelry portfolio, Signet CEO Virginia Drosos told analysts that lab-created diamonds are among the big jewelry trends she expects this year.  The company said it has expanded its man-made bridal jewelry selection in both its Zales and Kay Jewelers stores in response to the increased demand.  Fine jewelry brand Charles and Colvard, which makes lab-created diamonds, said consumers don\u2019t just want to look good with the jewelry they are wearing, they also want to feel good about it. \u201cAs the momentum for conscious consumerism grows, the surge towards lab grown diamonds isn\u2019t surprising,\u201d said Don O\u2019Connell, president and CEO of Charles & Colvard. \u201c[Consumers] want to know the origins of their stones and be reassured they\u2019re conflict-free. They\u2019re embracing the choice to purchase a piece of fine jewelry that aligns with their values.\u201d Lab-grown diamond brand VRAI said the pandemic, too, has sparked attention and action toward social and environmental issues. It said consumers are being more thoughtful and reassessing their purchasing habits, as well as the companies and industries they are supporting. There is, however, one important consideration for anyone buying lab-created diamonds: Man-made diamonds have little resale value.  So while you may not be able to tell a natural diamond from a factory made variety, someone with a trained eye can, said Golan. Once a stone is identified as a factory diamond, even though you paid a lot less for it, you also won\u2019t get much for it.  But the value of a ring isn\u2019t just monetary. \u201cAs a professional in the industry, I am asked all the time by people about what I think about a ring they have,\u201d said Moran, of Concierge Jewelers. \u201cI always say, if you love it, be happy with it. An engagement ring is a symbol of commitment and enduring love.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/27/business/diamonds-manmade-demand/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_21_opinions_sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic", "text": "The biggest tech news this week is the\u00a0ouster\u00a0of Sam Altman from his role as CEO of OpenAI, a move that has shaken the company and the industry. Hundreds of OpenAI employees have threatened to\u00a0resign. Altman has already\u00a0moved on\u00a0to a role at Microsoft. And OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is on its\u00a0third CEO\u00a0in as many days. It\u2019s all very juicy. But this drama should also be raising larger questions, far beyond one company\u2019s internal hirings and firings, including: Who are the people making the decisions\u00a0that will determine so much of our technological future? What guiding principles are they using to make those decisions? And how should other institutions \u2013 governments, non-tech industries, global alliances, regulatory bodies \u2013 reign in the worst excesses of potentially dangerous AI innovators? OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, with an explicit mission to harness what may soon be superhuman intelligence \u201cto benefit humanity as a whole.\u201d But that sensibility hasn\u2019t lasted. The company now has a multi-billion-dollar for-profit arm. They have been developing new technologies at lightning speed, and sometimes sending them out to the public\u00a0before some employees believed they were ready. The company has already reportedly invented an AI technology so dangerous they will never release it \u2013 but they also\u00a0won\u2019t tell\u00a0reporters or the public exactly what it is. This dynamic \u2013 a potentially dangerous technology developed at extreme speed, largely behind closed doors \u2013 is partly to blame for Altman\u2019s firing. The OpenAI board, according to\u00a0CNN\u2019s David Goldman, worried that \u201cthe company was making the technological equivalent of a nuclear bomb, and its caretaker, Sam Altman, was moving so fast that he risked a global catastrophe.\u201d At particular issue seemed to be Altman\u2019s efforts to make the tools behind ChatGPT available to anyone who wanted to make their own version of the chatbot. This could be widely disastrous, some board members worried. But then they fired him without warning, and apparently without involving Microsoft, the company\u2019s largest shareholder. Now, Altman is at the new AI group at Microsoft, and one has to wonder if the oversight and caution there will be on par with that at OpenAI, or if he\u2019ll be handed carte blanche to push as fast and hard as he wants. And for all the justified reticence of the OpenAI board, the company has carried out much of its work in secrecy \u2013 without the public really understanding what a handful of unaccountable technologists are building, and how it is nearly guaranteed to indelibly change their lives. AI is broadly understood to have the potential to reshape vast swaths of human existence. At the very least, it seems nearly guaranteed to change how we process information, how we communicate, how we learn and how we work (and if we work). And the ramifications could be much more extreme. AI technologies have already demonstrated the ability\u00a0to lie and to cover their tracks. They have already been able to\u00a0suggest the design\u00a0to make a virus spread more quickly. Many researchers\u00a0acutely understand\u00a0just how quickly these machines could develop the capacity to annihilate us, including Altman: He has a prepper\u2019s paradise prepared in Big Sur, complete with guns and \u201cgas masks from the Israeli Defense Force\u201d in case AI goes off the rails and the robots go to war against humans,\u00a0according to reporting in the New Yorker. But don\u2019t worry, he told an Atlantic reporter: If AI is determined to wipe us out, \u201cno gas mask is helping anyone.\u201d (If you want an excellent and terrifying rundown of AI\u2019s risks \u2013 at least those we understand right now, which are almost certainly a mere sliver of the looming perils \u2013\u00a0the Atlantic profile of Altman and his technology\u00a0is worth a read). AI is very exciting technology. But it is also a potentially very dangerous one, and not in the social media sense of \u201cit may give us bad self-esteem and make us lonelier\u201d but in the sense of \u201cit could break down human societies and kill us all.\u201d Given the life-altering potential of AI \u2013 that even if it doesn\u2019t kill us all, it will almost certainly change human existence in unprecedented ways at unprecedented speed \u2013 we all have a stake in how it\u2019s being developed. And yet the development is being left to a handful of people (who seem to be\u00a0largely\u00a0men) in Silicon Valley, and other tech pockets around the globe. And we all have a stake in whose interests AI will serve \u2013 and right now, its development is being funded with billions of dollars by people expecting to make a huge profit. Do the interests of the public align with the interests of the shareholders to whom profit-driven, potentially tremendously lucrative-for-a-few companies are beholden? Or with the interests of tech entrepreneurs who are primarily excited about being at the forefront of the AI revolution, regardless of the potential human costs? One thing is clear: AI is coming. And how it is built and unleashed on the public matters more than perhaps any technology of the past century. It is, indeed, up there with the atom bomb in its destructive potential \u2013 except likely more difficult to regulate and control. \u201cRegulation\u201d does not begin to scratch the surface of what\u2019s needed to make sure that the AI future is not a catastrophic one, especially since the development of AI is now a massive international arms race, with particularly horrific implications if bad actors develop this technology first. But regulation is, at minimum, a necessary step. So is transparency: In the US, companies have wide leverage to work behind a veil of secrecy, and much of what AI companies do is kept secret to stymy competition. But the public certainly has a right to understand what life-altering technologies are set to be inflicted upon us, and what the creators are doing to protect humanity \u2013 our jobs, our communities, our families, our connections, our educations and our abilities to build a life of purpose, but also our lives and our safety. The Altman story is fascinating because Altman is the most powerful figure in AI technology, which in effect makes him one of the most powerful men in the world. But that should give us pause: Who is he, what power does he hold, what is he doing with it, who does he answer to, and are we comfortable with this much life-altering potential being held by a few unaccountable people?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/21/opinions/sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "business"}}

Thursday\u2019s order by the US District Court for the Northern District of Texas sets the date for a high-profile showdown over Media Matters\u2019 research highlighting antisemitic and pro-Nazi content on the social media platform. In November, X\u00a0sued Media Matters, alleging that the group went out of its way to misrepresent the likelihood that users may encounter hate speech on the platform. CNN has reached out to X for comment on Thursday\u2019s order. Media Matters declined to comment. Media Matters President Angelo Carusone\u00a0has previously called X\u2019s suit \u201cfrivolous\u201d and an attempt to silence Musk\u2019s critics. The lawsuit claimed that Media Matters\u2019 testing methodology was not representative of how real users experience the site and that the group\u2019s reports distorted the odds of a person seeing extremist material. Motions for summary judgment in the case are due in December, and a decision by the judge on those filings could decide the case prior to trial. Musk has suffered setbacks in similar cases. In March, a federal judge in California reprimanded X and tossed out a lawsuit it had filed against another watchdog group, the Center for Countering Digital Hate.

{"id": "2024_06_14_media_infowars-alex-jones-liquidation-ruling", "text": "A Texas bankruptcy judge\u00a0has\u00a0rejected a proposed liquidation of\u00a0conspiracy theorist\u00a0Alex Jones\u2019\u00a0company\u00a0Free Speech Systems, the parent company of Infowars, saying that a denial of the bankruptcy plan was, in his opinion, in the best interest of the creditors. But the judge approved a separate liquidation of Jones\u2019 personal assets. Judge Chris Lopez said the Infowars bankruptcy process had dragged on and that it needed to stop \u201cincurring costs\u201d and let the families of Sandy Hook victims try to claim what they are owed through state courts. The families have not received payment of the approximately $1.5 billion in damages against Jones that they have won after he lied about the 2012 school massacre. \u201cThe right call is to dismiss this case,\u201d\u00a0Lopez said Friday. Lopez made his ruling in a\u00a0lengthy\u00a0decision\u00a0where he seemed emotional at times, once even noting the timing of this decision being made shortly before Father\u2019s Day. \u201cI think it needed to happen,\u201d he said towards the end of the hearing. \u201cI wish I would\u2019ve picked a better day.\u201d Unanswered questions The rejection of the bankruptcy plan leaves many questions to sort out in the decision\u2019s wake. Among them: What happens next for Infowars? And what legal avenues remain for the victims\u2019 families to collect the massive sum Jones still owes them? This judgment could be viewed as a partial victory for Jones, who fought the liquidation proposal \u2013 but so too did some families, whose attorneys said they\u2019ll benefit more from the bankruptcy plan\u2019s dismissal by going after Jones\u2019 assets immediately \u2013 rather than waiting for a prolonged bankruptcy procedure to play out. That ruling leaves Free Speech Systems to face its creditors outside of bankruptcy in state courts, noted Marie Reilly, professor of bankruptcy law at Penn State University. In a statement, an attorney for the families said they would press on. \u201cToday is a good day. Alex Jones has lost ownership of Infowars, the corrupt business he has used for years to attack the Connecticut families and so many others,\u201d said Chris Mattei, an attorney for the families. \u201cThe Court authorized us to move immediately to collect against all Infowars assets, and we intend to do exactly that.\u201d Lopez noted that the case is far from over. The interim trustee, and later the permanent trustee\ufeff, in Jones\u2019 personal case will ultimately decided Infowars\u2019 fate. \u201cThose trustees will make decisions about where things go,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not leaving thing\ufeffs into the wind here.\u201d Jay Westbrook, a University of Texas bankruptcy law professor, said that Infowars could still be sold by the court-appointed trustee to pay some of the damages owed to the families, but it would likely not fetch a high price. \u201cJones owns [Free Speech Systems] and thus his bankruptcy trustee could sell it, but without his active promotion it may be of little value, except for its inventory of products he has been selling,\u201d Westbrook said. Jones\u00a0had been\u00a0opposed to liquidating\u00a0Infowars and in recent days ranted on his show about what could be its impending shutdown, urging his audience to buy his products to support him. \u201cI\u2019m going to try to move forward and maximize the amount of money we can make at Info\ufeffwars to then have a wind-down,\u201d Jones said outside the court house after the hearing Friday. Jones\u2019 attorney, Vickie Driver, applauded the decision, saying the judge was fair in his review of the unique aspects of the case. \u201cMr. Jones did everything he could to preserve as much value as he could in Free Speech Systems to pay the plaintiffs,\u201d Driver said. Westbrook said if Jones continues at Infowars, it could maximize the amount of money the victims families could draw from it. \u201cThe problem is that Jones\u2019 appeal to his audience, awful as it is to say it, is probably the only thing of value he has that is not exempt in Texas and it is very difficult to make him use it to benefit anyone else,\u201d Westbrook said. Jones\u2019 personal bankruptcy approved Earlier on Friday, Lopez approved the liquidation of\u00a0Jones\u2019 personal assets after the conspiracy theorist agreed to convert\u00a0his personal bankruptcy into a Chapter 7 liquidation last week. The liquidation means that Jones will immediately lose control of his property except for certain exempt property, such as a $2 million house in Austin. Jones\u2019 decision to seek bankruptcy protection comes after he agreed to demands from the families of Sandy Hook victims. The judge said an interim trustee will be appointed to oversee Jones\u2019 estate, as is standard in these cases. Jones\u2019 attorney Vickie Driver told the court $2.8 million from the sale of Jones\u2019 ranch could be sent to the trustee. Jones founded Infowars, an influential conspiracy empire, in the late 1990s. Over the years, Jones has used the media company to poison the public discourse with lies and conspiracy theories, and he also enriched himself, making millions of dollars in the process. Whatever proceeds are gained from Jones\u2019 personal bankruptcy will amount to just a fraction of what he owes families of Sandy Hook victims. The families argued to the court that there is \u201cno prospect\u201d the Jones\u2019 company could produce a proper reorganization plan under a Chapter 11 bankruptcy, which would allow the company to remain operational through its restructuring. The judge\u2019s rulings on Friday would not prevent Jones from spreading conspiracy theories and lies online. X CEO Elon Musk restored Jones\u2019 social media account in December 2023 after a five-year ban from the platform. And Jones could go on any number of far-right outlets to share his outlandish views. But the Sandy Hook families are hoping\u00a0to seize Jones\u2019 social media accounts, arguing they are a key part of his Infowars business that allow Jones to promote his brand. And Jones may not be welcome at some venues: He had been listed as a guest on the Milwaukee stop on Tucker Carlson\u2019s live tour but was recently dropped from the lineup without explanation. Lies and conspiracy theories Since founding Infowars in the late 1990s, Jones has pushed several conspiracy theories, including the lie that the 2012 Newtown, Connecticut, mass school shooting was a so-called \u201cfalse flag\u201d operation staged by the government and that the grieving family members of 20 child victims were \u201cactors.\u201d\u00a0Jones makes money on those conspiracy theories by hawking high-priced dietary supplements to his audience. The mood Friday on Jones\u2019 Infowars was somber, with the far-right outlet\u2019s hosts speculating on its future. Chase Geiser, an Infowars host who had driven with Jones to the courthouse where the bankruptcy hearing was underway, made a brief appearance on the outlet, attempting to twist the judge\u2019s decision as one that would net Jones an even larger audience. Jones\u2019 regularly scheduled program was replaced with previously recorded interviews, airing conversations with Tucker Carlson and Russell Brand.

{"id": "2024_06_13_economy_biden-nominates-new-fdic-head", "text": "President Joe Biden has nominated Christy Goldsmith Romero as chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The announcement comes after current FDIC Chair Martin Gruenberg said he intended to resign once a successor is confirmed by the Senate following a scathing independent investigation detailing pervasive sexual harassment, discrimination and bullying at the agency charged with regulating the banking sector. Goldsmith Romero, a Democrat, served as special inspector general for the Troubled Asset Relief Program at the Treasury Department that was borne out of the Great Recession. In that role, she was responsible for overseeing efforts to crack down on banks\u2019 misuse of funds they received from the program. In a statement released Thursday, the White House said Goldsmith Romero \u201chas more than 20 years of experience as a career federal attorney and leader in financial regulation, serving under four Presidents\u201d and touted her experience promoting \u201cfinancial stability and market resiliency, integrity, and vibrancy.\u201d An agency under scrutiny She also has the advantage of having been unanimously confirmed by the Senate twice for previous positions, which may improve her odds of getting confirmed a third time. That contributed to why Biden chose to nominate her, a person familiar with the matter told C\ufeffNN. Republican and Democratic senators were briefed on Biden\u2019s intent to nominate her prior to Thursday\u2019s announcement, they added. As incoming head of the FDIC, she will largely be viewed as the figure responsible for fixing the longstanding problematic culture at the agency. Goldsmith Romero was picked instead of promoting someone internally at the FDIC because there was a general sense that it would take someone perceived as having a clean slate to usher in lasting change, the person said. An independent investigation commissioned by the FDIC released in early May confirmed the Wall Street Journal\u2019s reporting from last year. Among the findings were many women receiving sexually explicit messages as well as unwanted advances from male coworkers who were often in more senior roles. Minorities and women reported being passed over for promotions. A Hispanic employee said they were \u201casked by a colleague to recite the Pledge of Allegiance to prove that they were American.\u201d Many FDIC employees who partook in the investigation expressed a fear of retaliation for speaking out against alleged misconduct in addition to a lack of disciplinary actions taken against wrongdoers. Gruenberg\u2019s exit Under pressure from the top-ranking Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Gruenberg announced he would vacate the position once a new chair is confirmed. The move drew sharp rebuke from Republicans, who viewed it as politically motivated because if Gruenberg resigned immediately then Vice Chair Travis Hill, a Republican appointee, would have automatically become chair. That would have left the agency deadlocked with one other Republican and two Democrat members on the FDIC\u2019s board of directors, which would likely prevent controversial banking regulations, such as ramped-up capital requirements, from taking effect.

{"id": "2024_03_26_media_nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash", "text": "Cesar Conde has a decision to make \u2014 and it\u2019s not an especially difficult one. The NBCUniversal News Group chair is facing a torrent of backlash from his own staff after greenlighting the hire of former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel as a paid network contributor. Over the last 24 hours, the most prominent and recognizable NBC News and MSNBC personalities have voiced strong displeasure with the company\u2019s decision to welcome McDaniel to \u201cthe team.\u201d And they\u2019re not doing it via anonymous comments to the press. They\u2019re doing it on the record on NBCU\u2019s own air. Chuck Todd broke the dam on Sunday\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with a set of candid comments about the hiring, and Rachel Maddow capped the flood of backlash Monday night with a blistering 30-minute monologue eviscerating the network\u2019s leadership for the \u201cinexplicable\u201d move. Suffice to say, NBCU News Group is in unprecedented territory. Never has a network\u2019s C-suite ever been so thoroughly flogged by its most high-profile stars in such no holds barred fashion. Saying that Conde simply has a crisis on his hands would be a contender for understatement of the year. It\u2019s a five-alarm fire at NBCU News Group, and one of Conde\u2019s own making. While NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown were most directly responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring, a decision that MSNBC boss Rashida Jones did not object to it at the time, the buck ultimately stops with Conde, who hold the real power at the Peacock Network. McDaniel\u2019s hiring could not have happened without Conde\u2019s blessing. It does not take a brilliant political mind with prescient foresight to understand that hiring McDaniel would ignite a firestorm of outrage \u2014 from both within 30 Rock and outside it. Conde, someone who ostensibly supports American democracy, should have rejected McDaniel\u2019s hiring on the grounds that NBCU News Group could not put someone on its payroll who tried to subvert the 2020 vote. As so many of NBCU\u2019s staffers have underscored, the objection to McDaniel is not that she is a Republican. It\u2019s not even that she is a Donald Trump-supporting Republican. It\u2019s that she was an active participant in the plot to overthrow the last presidential election. That is not to even mention McDaniel\u2019s years of demonizing the press, smearing the journalists who work at NBC News and MSNBC as she sought to destroy the credibility of the organization that she ran to after being chased out of the RNC. The notion put forward by NBC that it needed to hire McDaniel to bring its viewers \u201can insider\u2019s perspective on national politics and the future of the Republican Party\u201d is absurd. If that\u2019s the case, the network should move to hire free agents like Tucker Carlson or Candace Owens. They too have their hands on the pulse of the Republican Party. In fact, they represent much more of where the GOP stands today than McDaniel. So, using NBC\u2019s logic, why not hire them? (Spoiler: News organizations rightfully have established basic standards for paid contributors. Asking that your employees have a commitment to democracy, to the truth, and to basic decency is not a big ask.) But even if Conde has no allegiance to basic democratic principles, which this hire calls into question, given that he is known to be a political player who cares deeply about his own image in the press, he should have been wise enough to foresee that hiring McDaniel would be an ill-conceived move. How this did not occur to Conde is unfathomable and shows a tremendous lack of judgment. Even more bizarre is Conde\u2019s management, or lack thereof, since the controversy erupted. It was clear early on that his employees at NBC News and MSNBC did not support McDaniel\u2019s hiring. If that was not evident on Friday, it was clear as day on Sunday after \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d The network\u2019s employees were not only flabbergasted and demoralized by the move, but absolutely enraged by it. At that point, the writing should have been on the wall for Conde \u2014 as it was for every other media executive that I have spoken with over the last 24 hours. It is evident that McDaniel has no real future as an NBC analyst and the decision to bring her on as a contributor will have to be reversed. After all, which NBC or MSNBC program is going to invite her on after all of this? The only real question for Conde after the Sunday morning scolding should have been how he chose to back out of the deal in the least painful way possible. To be fully honest, I very much expected a Sunday evening announcement from NBC, one that would have earned praise from the company\u2019s staff and quickly been swept away by the rush of Trump news Monday morning. But no such announcement came. Instead, Conde has allowed the mess to spiral absolutely out of control. MSNBC\u2019s top stars hammered the network\u2019s leadership throughout the day Monday over the hire. NBC News\u2019 Guild blasted Conde, saying in a statement that under him the company had quietly laid off employees over the last month and instead chosen to \u201cprioritize an election denier over its reporters.\u201d The already severe crisis was allowed to blossom into one of the worst corporate public relations catastrophes in recent memory. All the while, Conde has remained silent. I asked his spokesperson, Stephen Labaton, on Monday whether the NBCU News Group boss had any comment on the situation. Does he have any regret? I didn\u2019t get an on-the-record response. Suffice to say, however, that what Conde does moving forward will say a lot about his character and commitment to democratic values. It will also say a lot about the NBCU News Group and what type of organization it is. In her biting monologue on Monday night, however, Maddow did offer Conde a way out of this mess. \u201cMistakes will be made,\u201d Maddow said.\u201dBut our resilience as a democracy is going to be recognizing when decisions are bad ones and reversing those bad decisions. Hearing legitimate criticism, responding to it, and correcting course. Not digging in. Not blaming others. Take a minute. Acknowledge that maybe it wasn\u2019t the right call.\u201d \u201cIt is a sign of strength, not weakness, to acknowledge when you are wrong,\u201d Maddow added. \u201cIt is a sign of strength. And our country needs us to be strong now.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/media/nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_business_wells-fargo-staff-wfh-nightcap", "text": "The pandemic may have released us from the tyranny of the five-day-a-week office schedule. But the grip of America\u2019s busy-work culture is proving harder to shake. See here: Wells Fargo this week disclosed that it had fired more than a dozen employees for \u201csimulation of keyboard activity,\u201d Bloomberg reported, citing filings to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. CNN confirmed that multiple people were let go after a review of allegations that they created an \u201cimpression of active work.\u201d In other words, they were faking work, perhaps with the kind of mouse jiggler that you can buy online for $20. Those devices \u2014 which keep your screen active and move your cursor in convincingly random ways \u2014 took off during the early days of the pandemic. With employees no longer huddled together under fluorescent lighting, eating sad desk salads, bosses suddenly had to wonder whether their teams were actually working or slacking off. Even though most workers said they were more productive from home, many executives\u00a0 adopted \u201cbossware\u201d to monitor their staff\u2019s laptops. (And to be fair, yes \u2014 sometimes we did step away, selfishly tending to our own personal business, like walking the dog or staring out the window while contemplating our mortality. We hope you can forgive us.) At any rate, some bankers over at Wells Fargo seem to have gotten caught last month. It\u2019s not clear whether they were working from home or from a beach, or what they were doing instead of working. A bank spokesperson declined to offer more details about the firings, saying only that \u201cWells Fargo holds employees to the highest standards and does not tolerate unethical behavior.\u201d I have two immediate thoughts \u2022 Oh, come on, the highest standards? (More on that in a moment.)\u2022 We are four years into this remote/hybrid experiment, and some bosses still haven\u2019t figured out how to treat their workers like adults. \u201cThe sad part is that employees feel the need to purchase and use a mouse jiggler,\u201d Ashley Herd, founder of management training firm Manager Method, tells me. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a symptom of a much larger problem.\u201d In Wells Fargo\u2019s case, managerial mistrust would be understandable, given the bank\u2019s history. Since 2016, Wells has spent billions of dollars settling civil and criminal charges related to a multiyear scheme that led to more than 2 million fake accounts being opened without customers\u2019 consent or knowledge \u2014 a practice that began when managers began setting unrealistic sales goals for employees. Last year, the former head of the bank\u2019s retail operation was sentenced to three years of probation, while the bank\u2019s former CEO was banned from the industry. Since then, Wells has been trying to reform its own internal culture while trying to repair its brand. It\u2019s not hard to understand why it would want to keep some close tabs on its roughly 200,000 employees. Banks in particular have strict controls on work-issued devices because the industry is so tightly regulated. But firing people over mouse movers may not be the best way to foster a culture of trust and inclusion. \u201cManagers often assume the worst when they see someone\u2019s away, and so they\u2019re looking for any type of data to show that that\u2019s true,\u201d Herd says. \u201cSo, team members are going to innovate around that.\u201d \u2014CNN\u2019s Matt Egan contributed reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/business/wells-fargo-staff-wfh-nightcap/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_media_nbc-news-ousts-ronna-mcdaniel", "text": "NBC News on Tuesday ousted former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel, just days after her hiring as a paid political analyst sparked intense backlash from the network\u2019s top television anchors over McDaniel\u2019s role in subverting the 2020 election and attacks on the press. \u201cThere is no doubt that the last several days have been difficult for the News Group,\u201d NBCUniversal News Group President Cesar Conde said in a memo to staff. \u201cAfter listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor.\u201d \u201cI want to personally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down,\u201d Conde continued. \u201cWhile this was a collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team, I approved it and take full responsibility for it.\u201d Ahead of the network\u2019s decision, McDaniel spent the day Tuesday interviewing attorneys in preparation for a potential legal battle with NBC, a person familiar with the matter told CNN. Creative Artists Agency, the talent agency that brokered McDaniel\u2019s deal with NBC, also parted ways with her, the person said. The reversal comes after journalists and anchors at both NBC and its cable news sibling MSNBC publicly denounced the decision to hire McDaniel as a paid analyst in a stunning and unprecedented on-air rebuke of network brass that has embarrassed the Peacock Network. McDaniel, who recently stepped down from the RNC under pressure from former President Donald Trump, was involved in attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. As head of the RNC, she was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d In the years since, McDaniel continued to claim that the election had \u201cproblems\u201d and that Biden did not legitimately win the election, fanning the flames of election denialism. NBC\u2019s announcement Friday that it had hired McDaniel was quickly met with alarm by the network\u2019s journalists. The revolt spilled into public view on Sunday when McDaniel appeared on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with moderator Kristen Welker in her first interview since she was hired by the network. Welker disclosed that the interview had been scheduled to take place prior to NBC announcing McDaniel would become a paid contributor for the network, stating that she had no involvement in her hiring. Following the interview, Chuck Todd, NBC News\u2019 chief political analyst, delivered a stinging on-air criticism of NBC executives for their decision to hire McDaniel, telling Welker, \u201cI think our bosses owe you an apology for putting you in this situation.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a reason a lot of journalists at NBC News are uncomfortable with this,\u201d Todd said, explaining that under McDaniel, the RNC engaged in \u201cgaslighting\u201d and \u201ccharacter assassination\u201d when dealing with the news media. The following day, MSNBC hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough joined Todd in protesting the decision on their program \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d \u201cTo be clear, we believe NBC News should seek out conservative Republican voices to provide balance in their election coverage, but it should be conservative Republicans, not a person who used her position of power to be an anti-democracy election denier,\u201d\u00a0Brzezinski said. \u201cWe hope NBC will reconsider its decision. It goes without saying that she will not be a guest on \u2018Morning Joe\u2019 in her capacity as a paid contributor.\u201d Nicolle Wallace, host of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cDeadline: White House,\u201d later joined in the rebuke, saying on her program that the network\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel was nothing short of a potential threat to democracy. \u201cNBC News is, either wittingly or unwittingly, teaching election deniers that what they can do stretches well beyond appearing on our air and interviews to peddle lies about the sanctity and integrity of our elections,\u201d Wallace told viewers. Rachel Maddow \u2014 the network\u2019s biggest star \u2014 later devoted the first half-hour of her prime-time program to the controversy, saying the decision to hire McDaniel was \u201cinexplicable.\u201d Maddow took issue with McDaniel\u2019s long track record of demonizing the news media, labeling the press as \u201cfake news,\u201d and launching ugly attacks on NBC News journalists and MSNBC hosts. \u201cWe do not take it personally when we get attacked, when they say they want to put us on trial and execute us for treason,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so I want to associate myself with all my colleagues at MSNBC and NBC News who have voiced loud and principled objections to our company for putting on the payroll someone who hasn\u2019t just attacked us as journalists, but someone who is part of an ongoing project to get rid of our system of government,\u201d she said of McDaniel. \u201cSomeone who is still trying to convince Americans that this election stuff doesn\u2019t really work. That this last election wasn\u2019t a real result. That American elections are fraudulent.\u201c The on-air revolt ensnared NBC\u2019s top leaders, including NBCUniversal News Group chair Cesar Conde, NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown, who were responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring. MSNBC president Rashida Jones also did not object to the decision, people familiar with the matter said. In the wake of Conde\u2019s announcement to sever ties with McDaniel, MSNBC host Joy Reid and Maddow addressed the reversal on the network\u2019s air, praising the move as \u201cbold\u201d and \u201cstrong.\u201d \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/media/nbc-news-ousts-ronna-mcdaniel/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_12_success_equal-pay-day-2024", "text": "March 12 marks Equal Pay Day in the United States, a symbolic date representing the number of days women have to work into the current year just to make the same amount of money men made in the prior one. Put another way, to make 12 months\u2019 worth of a man\u2019s median wages, a woman has to work about 14.5 months. In dollars and cents, for every dollar a man earns, a woman is paid 84 cents, according to the National Committee on Pay Equity and the Equal Pay Today campaign. That\u2019s based on earnings data for full-time, year-round workers from the US Census in 2022, which was the most recent full-year data set available. If part-time workers and those not employed year-round are included, the gender pay gap is worse, at 78 cents on the dollar, said Deborah Vagins, national campaign director of Equal Rights Advocates and director of Equal Pay Today. The size of the actual wage gap between men and women will widen or narrow depending on age, level of education, choice of occupation and tenure, as well as race and ethnicity. The gender pay gap is typically widest when comparing the earnings of White men to Black, Hispanic or Native American women. And, generally speaking, the gap is narrower in a given job when men and women are in their early- to mid-20s (i.e., when they are new to the workforce and before children come along), and also when comparing wages by title, tenure and education level within a given field. But no matter how you slice and dice the data, there are very few scenarios in which women on average earn the same as men. Indeed, in its latest analysis of median weekly earnings last year by occupation, the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research found that women earned less than men not only in all 20 of the largest occupations for men but also in all 20 of the largest occupations for women. Among the largest occupations for women, the most egregious pay gaps were among financial managers (women earned 71% of every dollar a man earns), retail salesperson (72%), education and child care administrators (79%), administrative assistants (80%) and managers (81%). The narrowest gap was among cashiers, where women almost have pay parity (98%) with their male colleagues. Same old (and annoying) story every year While the overall gender pay gap has been narrowing over time \u2014 for example, Equal Pay Day in 2005 was April 19, a full five weeks later than this year\u2019s \u2014 the very fact that \ufeffsuch a gap exists at all in 2024 is a reminder that employers and society still have work to do in recognizing the value of women\u2019s contributions at work. \u201cThe gender wage gap is a national disgrace,\u201d said\u00a0Jamila Taylor, IWPR\u2019s president and CEO, in a statement. \u201cEven in professions typically dominated by women, men earn more for doing the same job. Equal pay for equal work has been the law of the land for more than a half-century, yet\u00a0women still cannot get fair treatment when it comes to employment and earnings. And it\u2019s worse for women of color, who face rampant racial discrimination in the workforce in addition to ongoing pay inequities.\u201d The good news is that there are now multiple efforts that may over time help reduce the problem. They include an increasing number of state-level pay transparency laws and bans on employers asking job candidates for their salary histories, which can help chronically underpaid women gain more of an equal footing when they apply for new jobs. There is also now a ban on federal government agencies asking job candidates\u2019 for their salary history and a proposed rule that would prohibit federal contractors from doing the same, as well as requiring them to post in their job ads the pay for given positions. But Vagins and others in the campaign for equal pay also want to see action at the federal legislative level, supporting two bills: the Salary Transparency Act and the Paycheck Fairness Act, which have been introduced in the US House and Senate multiple times. For instance, the Paycheck Fairness Act would, according to Equal Pay Today, \u201cbar retaliation against workers who voluntarily discuss or disclose their wages; close loopholes that have allowed employers to pay women less than men for the same work \u2026 [and] ensure women can receive the same robust remedies for sex-based pay discrimination that are currently available to those subjected to discrimination based on race and ethnicity.\u201d Absent such federal laws requiring all employers to make equal pay more of an imperative, Vagins said, achieving true pay parity for women will be slow in coming.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/12/success/equal-pay-day-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl", "text": "Sam Altman has agreed to return to lead OpenAI, the company said in a Tuesday post on X, just days after his surprise ouster as chief executive sparked an employee revolt that threatened to undermine what has been the leading company in the fledgling artificial intelligence industry. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman wrote that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft, which is the ChatGPT maker\u2019s biggest financial backer. The announcement appears to bring to an end days of chaos for the AI industry that included negotiations over who should lead OpenAI and how the firm should be run, as well as broader discussions about just how fast the arms race to develop AI technology should be moving. The details of Altman\u2019s firing and re-hiring remain murky. In its announcement Friday, OpenAI claimed that Altman had been insufficiently \u201ccandid\u201d with the board. That ambiguous language sent the rumor mill flying. But a key factor in Altman\u2019s ouster was the presence of\u00a0tensions between Altman, who favored pushing AI development more aggressively, and members of the original OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the crisis. As of Monday morning, Nadella had announced that Altman, along with fellow OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, would be joining Microsoft to lead a new AI research division. OpenAI said it had hired former Twitch chief Emmett Shear as interim CEO. But then hundreds of OpenAI employees, nearly the company\u2019s entire staff, threatened to leave, potentially for Microsoft, if the company\u2019s board didn\u2019t resign and reinstate Altman as CEO. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it invested billions in to help bolster its ambitions in developing AI, which many in Silicon Valley think will be the most important wave of technological advancement in the coming decades. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Microsoft CEO\u00a0Satya Nadella said on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d Altman\u2019s vision to quickly roll out and commercialize AI tools also appears to have won out. Publicly, Altman has long cautioned about risks posed by AI, and he\u202fhas pledged to lawmakers and customers that he would move OpenAI forward responsibly. \u201cIs [AI] gonna be like the printing press that diffused knowledge, power and learning widely across the landscape that empowered ordinary, everyday individuals that led to greater flourishing, that led above all to greater liberty?\u201d he said in a May Senate subcommittee hearing pressing for regulation. \u201cOr is it gonna be more like the atom bomb \u2014 huge technological breakthrough, but the consequences (severe, terrible) continue to haunt us to this day?\u201d But inside the company, Altman had been pushing to bring products to market more quickly and to sell them for a profit. Altman announced a few weeks ago at OpenAI\u2019s first-ever developer day that the company would make tools available so anyone could create their own version of ChatGPT. OpenAI has also worked with Microsoft to roll out ChatGPT-like technology across Microsoft\u2019s products. OpenAI and iPhone designer Jony Ive had also reportedly\u202fbeen in talks to raise $1 billion from Japanese conglomerate SoftBank for an AI device to replace the smartphone. \u2014 CNN\u2019s Juliana Liu and Diksha Madhok contributed reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_19_success_wall-street-bonuses", "text": "Last year wasn\u2019t the most lucrative for Wall Street bankers, but their bonus payouts still easily trounced US median household income. The average Wall Street bonus for 2023 was $176,500, according to estimates that will be released Tuesday morning by New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli. That\u2019s down 2% from the $180,000 recorded in 2022. Both those averages were well below the $240,000 paid out in 2021. That the average bonus was slightly down isn\u2019t surprising. Wall Street earnings last year were mixed, and merger and acquisition activity was underwhelming. \u201cWall Street\u2019s profits were up 1.8% in 2023, but firms have taken a more cautious approach to compensation and more employees have joined the securities industry, which accounts for the slight decline in the average bonus,\u201d DiNapoli said in a statement. Nevertheless, a little perspective: The average Wall Street bonus, which comes on top of the nearly half-a-million-dollar average Wall Street salary, was itself almost 2.5 times higher than the median US household income of $74,580, according to Census data for 2022. Wall Street bonuses and general employment in the securities industry provide vital revenue streams for the New York State and New York City economies, accounting most recently for 27% of the state\u2019s tax collections and 7% of city tax revenue, according to DiNapoli\u2019s office. The securities industry \ufeffin the city employed roughly 198,500 people last year, up from 191,600 the year before. And DiNapoli estimates that 1 in 11 of the city\u2019s jobs are either directly or indirectly associated with the industry. The total estimated bonus pool for 2023 was\u00a0slightly lower than the year before and is\u00a0projected to bring in $4 million less in state income tax revenue and $2 million less for the city revenue than bonuses in 2022 did. Still, DiNapoli noted, \u201cWhile these bonuses affect income tax revenues for the state and city, both budgeted for larger declines so the impact on projected revenues should be limited.\u201d It should be noted that the comptroller\u2019s numbers only reflect the bonuses paid to securities industry employees working for firms based in New York City. Beyond bringing in tax revenue for government coffers, Wall Street workers contribute substantially to the local Gotham economy. DiNapoli said that more employees in financial services (65%) are working in-office on any given day compared to 58% working in other industries in the city, at least as of September 2023. And that securities industry employees use the subway more than other workers in the city. All in, he estimates that Wall Street is responsible for roughly 14% of economic activity in the city. As critical as that is, the city and state are about much more than just Wall Street. \u201cThe securities industry\u2019s continued strength should not overshadow the broader economic picture in New York, where we need all sectors to enjoy full recovery from the pandemic,\u201d DiNapoli said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/19/success/wall-street-bonuses/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_business_elon-musk-tesla-pay-billions-vote", "text": "Tesla shareholders have re-approved a pay package for CEO Elon Musk worth billions that was already thrown out by a Delaware judge earlier this year in a vote that also approved moving Tesla to Texas. The two measures \u2013 Musk\u2019s pay package from 2018 and moving the car company\u2019s incorporation state \u2013 were completed at the company\u2019s annual meeting Thursday afternoon. But the outcome of the the votes had already been revealed by Musk in a tweet overnight, when he said both measures had the support they need to pass. Tesla reported Friday that the pay package was approved by 84% of shares not held by Musk or his brother Kimbal Musk, who did not vote. That\u2019s more than the 73% of shares that voted in favor when it originally passed in 2018. The move of incorporation to Texas passed with 63% of shares outstanding voting in favor. The compensation package, 303 million options to buy Tesla shares at a drastically reduced price, was worth $51 billion when it was voided by a Delaware judge nearly five months ago. The package was worth $48.3 billion as of Thursday\u2019s market close, due to a steady decline in Tesla share price (TSLA) this year. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment on his post and had no tweet of its own or announcement on its investor sites. It did file with the Securities and Exchange Commission a collection of tweets on the subject, including the tweet from Musk. Tesla\u2019s board had said that if the shareholders didn\u2019t approve the pay package, the company won\u2019t get the attention it needs from Musk as it faces several challenges: Tesla\u2019s stock price has slid by more than half from its peak as a trillion-dollar company in late 2021, its sales have fallen short of forecasts and its profits are squeezed by a global price war for EVs that Musk started himself. Delaware Chancery Court Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick in January ruled in favor of shareholders who challenged the package. She wrote the process that Tesla board used to award the package was \u201cdeeply flawed\u201d and that Musk and the board had failed to meet \u201cthe burden of proving that the compensation plan was fair.\u201d She criticized the board for being too close to the controversial CEO to represent the interests of shareholders, writing that the board committee that came up with the package included Antonio Gracias, a personal friend of Musk\u2019s who often took family vacations with the Tesla CEO, as well as Todd Maron, \u201cMusk\u2019s former divorce attorney and whose admiration for Musk moved him to tears during his deposition.\u201d In her decision throwing out the original package, McCormick rejected the argument that Musk would be uncompensated if the package was thrown out, writing, \u201cMusk\u2019s preexisting equity stake provided him tens of billions of dollars for his efforts.\u201d Trying to keep Musk\u2019s attention on Tesla Tesla\u2019s filings argue it must keep the pay package in place to keep Musk fully engaged running Tesla and not focusing on his other companies. He is also the head of SpaceX, Neuralink and the Boring Company. And in addition to being the primary shareholder of those companies, he\u2019s the owner of X, formerly known as Twitter. \u201cThis is obviously not about the money,\u201d Tesla Chair Robyn Denholm wrote in a letter to shareholders. \u201cWe all know Elon is one of the wealthiest people on the planet, and he would remain so even if Tesla were to renege on the commitment we made in 2018. Elon is not a typical executive, and Tesla is not a typical company.\u201d Rather it\u2019s about \u201cwhat will motivate him to continue to create value for stockholders,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWhat we recognized in 2018 and continue to recognize today is that one thing Elon most certainly does not have is unlimited time,\u201d Denholm wrote. \u201cNor does he face any shortage of ideas and other places he can make an incredible difference in the world. We want those ideas, that energy and that time to be at Tesla, for the benefit of you, our owners. But that requires reciprocal respect.\u201d Some of the supporters of the pay package include Cathie Wood, CEO and chief investment officer of Ark Invest and a long-time Tesla bull, and Ron Baron, CEO of Baron Capital, which has Tesla as one of its top holdings with a stake worth more than $2 billion. \u201cElon is the ultimate \u2018key man,\u2019\u201d said Baron in a recent statement. \u201cWithout his relentless drive and uncompromising standards, there would be no Tesla.\u201d But there are some major shareholders who have said they voted against the deal, including the California State Teachers Retirement Fund as well as the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund, which has 28 million shares of Tesla stock, according to its most recent filing. \u201cWhile we appreciate the significant value generated under Mr. Musk\u2019s leadership since the grant date in 2018, we remain concerned about the total size of the award,\u201d said a statement from the Norwegian fund. Part of the problem with winning support is that Musk is far more controversial now than he was in 2018 and appears to be far less focused on simply running Tesla. He famously bought social media platform Twitter for $44 billion in 2022, selling $22.9 billion of his Tesla shares to help fund that purchase. He has been accused in multiple shareholder suits of improperly selling $7.5 billon of those shares late that year, knowing that Tesla was due to soon report disappointing sales that would reduce the company\u2019s share price. Under his management of Twitter, now known as X, he\u2019s restored accounts for users who had been banned for hate speech, advocacy of violence or misinformation. Meanwhile, allegations about widespread antisemitism on the platform and Musk\u2019s own endorsement of an antisemitic tweet have driven away many advertisers. His management of X isn\u2019t the only way he\u2019s become more controversial. This week former employees of SpaceX, of which he is also CEO and primary shareholder, filed a lawsuit allegeding they were illegally fired for raising concerns about gender discrimination and sexual harassment at the rocket company. But perhaps a more serious concern among Tesla shareholders is the pioneering electric car company itself. While shares shot up more than 1,700% between when the original package was approved in 2018 and their high point in November 2021, making Musk the richest person in the world at that time, it has lost more than half of that value since, including a 30% drop this year. Tesla has been forced to cut prices in the face of weaker demand and increased competition from other automakers offering their own EVs. One of Musk\u2019s fans on X, who tweets under the handle \u201cWholeMarsCatalog,\u201d retweeted Musk\u2019s tweet announcing the shareholder support and commented: Okay @elonmusk we got you the options. Now you have to make Tesla the most valuable company on Earth. Deal?\u201d To which Musk responded with his own tweet, \u201cYes.\u201d The ear\ufeffly market reaction to the vote was positive. Shares of Tesla rose 3% in Thursday trading. Even with Musk\u2019s pay package again endorsed by shareholders, the Delaware court could still have the final say. Tesla attorneys have told the Delaware court that the move of its incorporation to Texas is not an effort to evade Delaware jurisdiction.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/business/elon-musk-tesla-pay-billions-vote/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "business"}}

During his meeting on Thursday with CEOs in Washington, Trump told the executives he wants to cut the corporate tax rate to 20%, down from 21% currently, the sources said. Trump met privately with roughly 100 corporate leaders, including JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, Apple CEO Tim Cook and Walmart CEO Doug McMillon, according to one of the people familiar with the matter.

Those tax cuts, widely criticized by Democrats, are set to expire at the end of 2025 and extending them could cost $4.6 trillion, according to the Congressional Budget Office. An even deeper cut to the corporate rate could add to the cost. Trump, meeting with CEOs at the powerful Business Roundtable lobbying group, said he wants to lower the rate to 20% because it\u2019s a round number and would boost jobs by making the United States more competitive on the global stage, the person familiar with the matter told CNN. Trump said he wants to make all of the tax cuts enacted in 2017 permanent and also discussed with the CEOs the border, inflation and energy \u2014 including the need for more oil production, sources said.

The recall follows a May 21 accident in Phoenix, Arizona, in which a Waymo driverless car hit a telephone pole that was installed in the roadway in an alley. The vehicle was pulling over to pick up a passenger when it struck the pole at low speed, according to Waymo. While the car was severely damaged, no one was hurt, according to documents Waymo filed with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The recall applies only to the fleet of modified Jaguar I-Pace SUVs Waymo owns and operates itself. The recall involves a software update on all 672 of the vehicles. The recall was first reported by The Verge. \u201cWe have already deployed mapping and software updates across our entire fleet, and this does not impact our current operations,\u201d a Waymo spokesperson said in an email. In documents filed with the National Highway Traffic Administration, Waymo described the issue is as an \u201c[i]nsufficient ability to avoid pole or pole-like permanent objects within the drivable surface [which] may result in an increased risk of a collision.\u201d This became an issue in circumstances where there wasn\u2019t a curb or clear road shoulder \u2013 such as in an alleyway where the road surface reaches from buildings on one side to buildings on the other \u2013 and there were poles installed within that roadway. In that case, the vehicle might not have recognized the actual degree of hazard a pole represented. To correct the problem, Waymo updated the software for its driverless vehicles to make them more likely to avoid things that appear to be poles in the road and, also, by improving their maps to better define the edges of roads, even where they might not be clear.

Raspberry Pi stock soared as much as 40% in early trade before paring those gains slightly by 11.54 a.m. ET to trade at \u00a33.85 ($4.90), still about 38% above their listing price. The initial public offering (IPO) valued the startup at nearly \u00a3542 million ($689 million). The Cambridge-based company started life in 2012 as a commercial subsidiary of the Raspberry Pi Foundation, a charity founded four years earlier to promote computer science in schools. It has since become known as the maker of small but fully fledged computers that fit on a single board. Some of them cost as little as $35. These boards, some the size of a credit card, can be connected to bigger devices, such as a desktop screen, or used as components to power machines such as smart speakers and robots. To date, Raspberry Pi has sold more than 60 million computers worldwide, according to its website. Industrial customers, such as tech companies and manufacturers, buy more than 70% of its computers, with the devices cropping up in everything from high-tech farming systems to self-pouring beer taps. It sells the rest to education providers and computer science \u201centhusiasts,\u201d according to its website. In 2022, the University of Cambridge declared one of the company\u2019s computers \u2014 its cheapest, with a price tag of only $35 \u2014 the \u201cbest-selling computer to come out of the UK.\u201d A rare win for London\u2019s stock market The IPO raised \u00a3166 million ($211 million), making it Britain\u2019s second-biggest this year, according to data provider Dealogic. Raspberry Pi plans to invest the funds raised in developing its products and expanding its educational activities. The company\u2019s market debut is a boon for London\u2019s languishing stock market, which has seen several companies ditch it in recent years or choose New York to go public. That includes British chipmaker Arm (ARM), which notched the biggest IPO of last year globally when it listed on New York\u2019s Nasdaq in September. Eben Upton, the Cambridge University-educated co-founder and chief executive of Raspberry Pi, said in a statement Tuesday that \u201cLondon has the right caliber and sophistication of investor to support growing, ambitious technology businesses such as Raspberry Pi.\u201d The Raspberry Pi Foundation is the company\u2019s main shareholder, according to Raspberry Pi\u2019s IPO prospectus.

However, it\u2019s clear that there is something different about Dex; she\u2019s an entirely virtual \u201cdigital human,\u201d designed by a startup in the UK. For her performances, Dex is displayed on a video screen or as a holographic projection, with her mixes created by humans. She is animated using Unreal Engine \u2014 a 3D modeling software widely used in video games \u2014 combined with motion-capture. Generative artificial intelligence allows her to remember information and respond to questions, using a voice also generated by AI. \u201cShe\u2019s probably one of the only digital humans in the performance space that you can have a conversation and interact with,\u201d says Denise Harris, CCO of startup Sum Vivas. \u201cYou can ask her anything.

According to CEO and founder Rob Sims, digital humans can help bridge the gap between AI technology and people. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve found is when people start working with and conversing with a digital human, they very quickly suspend disbelief,\u201d Sims tells CNN. \u201cIt becomes natural.\u201d AI explosion Since OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT was launched in November 2022, considerable hype has surrounded the potential of generative AI \u2014 artificial intelligence powered by huge datasets of information, capable of generating text outputs in a conversational way. Record levels of investment into generative AI have followed, with over $21 billion poured into the industry during the first nine months of last year, according to data insights company Pitchbook. In March 2023, Google launched Bard (recently renamed Gemini) and around the same time Anthropic released its AI assistant Claude. As generative AI chatbots become increasingly ubiquitous, Sum Vivas is one of several companies looking to make them more human. US and New Zealand-based UneeQ has developed animated conversational \u201cdigital humans\u201d that can be used as virtual sales reps and customer service agents on company websites, and this month it debuted Sama 2.0, an animated cabin crew member that answers questions on Qatar Airways\u2019 website and app. Microsoft recently announced that users of its Azure software would be able to create lifelike avatars capable of turning text prompts into animated speech. However, there are widespread concerns about the impact AI could have on the job market.  \u201cWhen we rely on automated tools, what skills are we losing in the process?\u201d asks Jennifer Ding, senior researcher at the Alan Turing Institute, the UK\u2019s national institute for data science and artificial intelligence. \u201cIn some ways, we think of AI as something that\u2019s helping us or augmenting our work,\u201d she says. \u201cHowever, alongside, this fear of replacement is bubbling up more and more.\u201d Harris, however, points to new opportunities within digital human design and development. \u201cEvery scenario that we found, we\u2019re creating jobs and working in harmony with people rather than taking away jobs,\u201d she says. \u201cDigital humans, first and foremost, should work with other human colleagues,\u201d adds Sims. \u201cWe\u2019ll move into a stage where digital humans will start to become just another member of the team, with added benefits for that team, and obviously the customers they serve.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/business/digital-humans-ai-dj-dex-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_06_14_investing_premarket-stocks-trading-higher-longer-rates", "text": "A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business\u2019 Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up\u00a0right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link. At least one interest rate cut is still on the table for 2024, but in the short term, higher US borrowing costs are here to stay. The Federal Reserve on Wednesday held rates steady for the seventh consecutive time and penciled in just one cut this year, down from the three it first projected last December. Recent economic data has encouraged investors that inflation is cooling again after showing signs of sticking earlier this year. The Consumer and Producer Price Index reports for May both came in softer than expected this week, helping lead stocks to record highs. Still, traders are widely expecting the central bank to keep rates where they are again in July. If the Fed does indeed hold off on changes, interest rates will stay at their current 23-year high until at least September. How should traders invest in a higher-for-longer rate environment? Before the Bell spoke with Wylie Tollette, chief investment officer at Franklin Templeton Investment Solutions. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Before the Bell: What do higher-for-longer rates mean for the stock market? The stock market is always forward-looking, and I think the market may have already priced in the fewer rate cuts [before the Fed meeting]. As we\u2019ve seen throughout the year, the expectation for rate cuts has been steadily declining. What I find interesting and actually kind of invigorating is the resilience of the US economy in the face of these expected higher-for-longer rates. I think that we expected, consistent with most financial economists and investors, higher rates to really begin biting the economy more quickly and more significantly last year. As it turns out, I think our new hypothesis, based on everything we\u2019ve seen, is that these higher-for-longer rates are really just a return to a more normal rate environment, sort of a pre-global financial crisis rate environment. Which stocks could perform poorly due to higher-for-longer rates? There will be some sectors that higher-for-longer rates will impact. And we\u2019ve already seen some of them. For example, real estate. Most real estate is financed. Commercial real estate in particular, offices and retail, I think will continue to suffer. We\u2019ve seen that already, and I think there\u2019s probably still some more pain to come. Another area like cars, the big purchases that many consumers finance. Obviously, higher-for-longer rates makes that financing more expensive. And so we can see consumer durables slowing down or suffering a little bit in this higher-for-longer rate environment. In general, smaller-cap stocks, most regardless of sector, will probably have a harder time in this environment right now. What about stocks that could perform well in a higher-rate environment? Semiconductors, those we think will continue to do well. They\u2019ve almost become the new defensives because they have so much cash on their balance sheet. They don\u2019t rely on financing to finance their internal growth and investment, and their demand cycles aren\u2019t terribly sensitive to higher interest rates. And we\u2019ve seen that already priced into a lot of Big Tech. The Magnificent Seven, we actually continue to see pretty strong growth prospects for those companies in the face of higher rates. Energy and materials traditionally do reasonably well in higher-for-longer rates. We\u2019ve seen utilities rally. We actually think that could continue. There\u2019s just a lot of demand for electricity with electric vehicles and artificial intelligence. We see utilities needing to increase supply and really being under pressure to do that, which provides an interesting and perhaps a rare opportunity to actually benefit and see some real growth in the utility sector. Unhappy workers may reduce global GDP by as much as 9%, Gallup estimates Employees\u2019 negative daily emotions and lack of well-being can ultimately hurt worker engagement \u2014 and the economy, according to a new report released this week. Gallup, in its \u201cState of the Global Workplace,\u201d estimates that low employee engagement costs the global economy $8.9 trillion, or 9% of global GDP, reports my colleague Jeanne Sahadi. The report includes findings from its latest annual World Poll, which surveyed 128,278 employees in more than 140 countries last year. That poll found that roughly 20% of workers globally reported feeling lonely, angry or sad on a daily basis. And 41% on average say they feel stress. Those most likely to say they feel lonely were younger workers (22%), employees who worked remotely full-time (25%) and those who felt most disengaged on the job (31%). While work isn\u2019t always the cause of a person\u2019s negative daily emotions, employers should still be concerned. That\u2019s because work can either improve or worsen employees\u2019 well-being. On the one hand, the Gallup report noted, \u201cwhen employees find their work and work relationships meaningful, employment is associated with high levels of daily enjoyment and low levels of all negative daily emotions. Notably, half of employees who are engaged at work are thriving in life overall.\u201d On the other, researchers found that being disengaged at work can negatively affect a person\u2019s wellbeing as much as \u2014 or more than \u2014 not having a job at all. \u201cEmployees who dislike their jobs tend to have high levels of daily stress and worry, as well as elevated levels of all other negative emotions,\u201d they wrote. \u201cOn many wellbeing items (stress, anger, worry, loneliness), being actively disengaged at work is equivalent to or worse than being unemployed.\u201d Read more here.

{"id": "2024_06_11_business_elizabeth-holmes-appeal", "text": "Lawyers for Elizabeth Holmes, the convicted Silicon Valley grifter, presented her appeal before a California court Tuesday, revisiting a case that exposed the shortcomings of the tech world\u2019s fake-it-till-you-make-it startup culture. Holmes was sentenced to 11 years in prison for defrauding investors in her failed blood-testing company, Theranos. She is seeking a new trial, arguing that the judge in her case erred in several decisions during the 2022 proceedings. Holmes is serving her sentence at a minimum-security facility in southern Texas and, as with most defendants, did not appear in court when California\u2019s Ninth Circuit heard her appeal. Since her conviction, her projected release date from prison has been moved up, shaving about two years off her sentence. Critical to the government\u2019s case against Holmes was convincing jurors that the Theranos founder not only knew her company\u2019s technology was flawed but went to great lengths to conceal it from investors. In their appeal, defense lawyers have homed in on what they see as the court\u2019s violation of evidentiary rules regarding one of the prosecution\u2019s key witnesses. Pushing back, prosecutors stated Tuesday that the lower court did\u00a0not err in its handling of the case and that\u00a0\u201cif there were any trial errors, they were harmless given the overwhelming and multifaceted evidence against Holmes.\u201d A decision on the appeal wasn\u2019t expected to come down immediately. Legal experts said the three judges are likely to consider the high-profile nature of the case and could take several weeks or months to issue a ruling. Theranos unravels Over the past decade, the story of Theranos \u2014 valued at $10 billion at its peak \u2014 has become a cautionary tale of tech-startup hubris and hype. It had all the hallmarks of a Silicon Valley juggernaut: A 19-year-old founder who dropped out of Stanford and dressed like Steve Jobs, an audacious mission to disrupt the medical establishment and lots of buzz among deep-pocketed investors such as Larry Ellison and Rupert Murdoch. The pitch was simple: Just one drop of blood, spun through Theranos\u2019 proprietary machine, could deliver faster, more accurate results than traditional testing that required whole vials drawn from a patient\u2019s veins. The trouble is, the tech never really worked, as a Wall Street Journal investigation revealed in a series of articles in 2015. Theranos\u2019 unraveling, and Holmes herself, became the subject of a bestselling book, a Hulu scripted series and an award-winning documentary. Federal prosecutors in 2018 charged Holmes and her former partner, Ramesh \u201cSunny\u201d Balwani, with running a multimillion-dollar scheme to defraud investors, doctors and patients. A jury ultimately convicted her on four counts of defrauding investors, but not guilty on the counts that pertained to defrauding patients. Holmes knowingly concealed the technology\u2019s problems, and still pushed to get the company\u2019s Edison devices into pharmacies, prosecutors argued. \u201cHolmes repeatedly told potential investors that major pharmaceutical companies had validated Theranos\u2019s device, and the US military was using it in the battlefield to treat wounded soldiers,\u201d lawyers for the government said in court filings. \u201cIn truth, Theranos\u2019s device could never complete more than 12 types of blood tests, often with less accuracy, less automation, and less consistency\u201d than conventional methods. And the devices were never used in war zones.  Balwani was convicted separately and sentenced to 13 years in prison. Prosecutors have sought to underscore the real-world implications of Holmes\u2019 and Balwani\u2019s lies to investors. In a filing to the appeals court, they note that one woman received results from Theranos\u2019 test indicated \u201cshe was going to have a miscarriage when she was carrying a healthy baby,\u201d the filing states. \u201cAnother received results indicating that he had late-stage prostate cancer when he did not. Another was informed (incorrectly) that she had HIV.\u201d An uphill battle Holmes\u2019 lawyers have said in court documents that the criminal trial was \u201cteeming with issues for appeal.\u201d Specifically, they focused on the testimony of Kingshuk\u00a0Das, the former lab director at Theranos, who testified during the trial that he found many problems with the Edison machines and that he believed they were \u201cunsuitable for clinical use.\u201d On Tuesday, Holmes\u2019 lawyer said Das\u2019 opinion about whether the technology worked was \u201cclassic expert opinion,\u201d given by someone who was not vetted as an expert witness in the case. Holmes has argued that Judge Edward Davila erred in his ruling that she could not refer to the testimony of Balwani, her former boyfriend and business partner, in her own defense. Her lawyers have argued that prosecutors\u2019 statements about Holmes\u2019 relationship with Balwani \u201cwould have probably led to Ms. Holmes\u2019 acquittal in a new trial.\u201d During Holmes\u2019 trial, the government characterized the pair\u2019s relationship as one between two co-equals, her laywers said in a 2022 filing. Then, in Balwani\u2019s trial, \u201cthe government took the opposite position and highlighted Mr. Balwani\u2019s age, experience, and influence over Ms. Holmes.\u201d Criminal appeals are always an uphill battle, and Holmes\u2019 case is no exception. \u201cThe issues that Holmes\u2019s legal team has raised\u2026are all issues that are difficult to win on appeal \u2014 it\u2019s difficult to win on issues when you\u2019re Monday morning quarterbacking the decisions made by the judge,\u201d said Agustin Orozco, a former federal prosecutor and a partner with the law firm Crowell & Moring. In prosecutors\u2019 filing to the court, Orozco notes, they frequently raise a \u201charmless error\u201d argument \u2014 essentially saying that even if the lower court did make mistakes,\u00a0\u201cit doesn\u2019t matter because the evidence is so overwhelming against Holmes.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/business/elizabeth-holmes-appeal/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "business"}}

Getting dollars and euros in Russia is practically impossible.\u201d With Moscow pursuing closer trade and political ties with Beijing, China\u2019s yuan has ousted the dollar to become MOEX\u2019s most traded currency, accounting for 53.6% of all foreign currency traded in May. Dollar-ruble trading volume on MOEX tends to be around 1 billion rubles ($11 million) a day, while euro-ruble trading hovers at around 300 million rubles ($3 million) daily. For yuan-ruble trading, daily volumes now regularly top 8 billion rubles ($90 million). Dollar rates jump On the eve of the national holiday, the ruble closed at 89.10 to the dollar\u00a0and at 95.62 against the euro. Following the sanctions news, some banks immediately jacked up their dollar rates. Norvik Bank said Wednesday that it was offering to buy dollars for just 50 rubles but sell for 200 rubles, though it later adjusted the rates to 88.20/97.80. Tsifra Bank was buying dollars at 89 rubles and selling at 120. The US Treasury said it was \u201ctargeting the architecture of Russia\u2019s financial system, which has been reoriented to facilitate investment into its defense industry and acquisition of goods needed to further its aggression against Ukraine.\u201d Russia\u2019s central bank has been bracing for such sanctions for around two years. In July 2022, the bank said it was modeling various sanctions scenarios with foreign exchange market participants and infrastructure organizations. \u201cThis is bad but expected news,\u201d Russian broker T-Investments said on Telegram. Forbes Russia had reported in 2022 that the central bank was discussing a mechanism for managing the ruble-dollar exchange rate should exchange trading be halted in the event of sanctions against MOEX and its National Clearing Centre, which was also hit by the new sanctions. MOEX said share trading and money market trades settled in dollars and euros would also cease.

The probe is yet another complication for the social media platform, which is already facing the threat of a potential US ban or a forced divestment from its Chinese parent company. The sources said that the FTC is probing TikTok over an alleged violation of the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection rule, which requires companies to notify parents and obtain consent before collecting data from children under 13. The agency is also investigating whether TikTok violated a portion of the FTC Act that prohibits \u201cunfair or deceptive\u201d business practices, the sources said, in denying that TikTok user data could be accessed by individuals in China. The FTC could bring a suit against TikTok or settle with the company in the coming weeks, according to one of the sources. Politico reported news of the probe earlier. When asked about the investigation, FTC Director of Public Affairs Douglas Farrar replied: \u201cNo comment.\u201d TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The FTC probe comes as TikTok faces an existential threat in the US. Earlier this month, a bipartisan group in the US House of Representatives voted to pass a law forcing TikTok to be sold by ByteDance or face a ban from US app stores. The bill is now before the Senate, and President Joe Biden has said he would sign it if it gets to his desk. Senate leaders, however, have indicated they are taking a deliberate approach \u2014\u00a0which could lead to delays or even potentially doom the House bill. The short-form video company, owned by Chinese firm ByteDance, has denied assertions that its app poses a national security threat to US citizens. TikTok, which does not operate in China, has said that the Chinese government has never accessed US user data. Cybersecurity experts say Chinese laws require ByteDance to cooperate with that country\u2019s intelligence demands\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a fact that, given ByteDance\u2019s ownership of TikTok, could hypothetically put US user data at risk. To address that issue, TikTok has taken steps to store its US user data on cloud servers controlled by US tech giant Oracle and established internal protocols limiting access by non-US employees. TikTok acknowledged to Congress in 2022 that employees based in China could access US user data, following a report that year by BuzzFeed News that ByteDance employees had accessed that information on multiple occasions. TikTok CEO Shou Chew, in his first appearance before Congress last year, also acknowledged that several ByteDance employees were fired for spying on certain US journalists as part of a \u201cmisguided attempt\u201d to hunt down leakers within the company.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/ftc-tiktok-probe-privacy-and-security/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_cars_chrome-cars-stellantis-jeep-volkswagen-vw", "text": "Chrome\u2019s century-long reign as that added bit of flash and glamour on new cars may be coming to an end. For least one major auto maker, environmental and serious health concerns are outweighing its aesthetic appeal. Chrome has long provided an eye-catching sparkle, creating an upscale look while also protecting unpainted metal car parts from corrosion. It\u2019s served as a by-word for (especially American) automotive opulence. \u201cChrome on a car is the automotive equivalent of using jewelry on an outfit,\u201d said Leslie Kendall, head curator of the Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles. But Stellantis \u2013 the company that makes Dodge, Jeep, Ram, Fiat, and Maserati vehicles \u2013 among others, is committed to doing away with chrome on all its new models. The plan even has a name. Inside Stellantis, it\u2019s called \u201cDeath of Chrome,\u201d said Stellantis\u2019s chief global designer, Ralph Gilles. Stellantis vehicles, including its newest Jeep model, will sport badges and trim pieces that may not have chrome\u2019s mirror-like shine but customers will come to like them even better, Gilles promises. \u2018Death of Chrome\u2019 \u201cDeath of Chrome\u201d comes in response to chrome plating\u2019s lesser-known dark side. Hexavalent chromium, or \u201cchromium 6,\u201d the form of the element chromium involved in the plating process, is an aggressive cancer-causing agent, according to government regulators in the United States and Europe. \u201cHexavalent chromium is a carcinogen that is the second most potent toxic air contaminant identified by the state,\u201d the California Air Resources Board said in a statement provided to CNN. \u201cIt is 500 times more toxic than diesel exhaust and has no known safe level of exposure.\u201d This does not mean that the chrome-plated parts on your car or motorcycle are dangerous. The metallic form of chrome that provides the mirror shine on a car brand\u2019s logo or trim is perfectly safe. The risk to human health comes during the electro-plating process, regulators say, when the hexavalent chromium that is used can come into contact with workers or be released into the atmosphere. Chrome platers have methods to contain the vapors and minimize human exposure. Southern California boasts the highest concentration of chrome plating shops in America and regulators in that state have been requiring those methods for years. But California is now moving toward an outright ban on chrome plating using hexavalent chromium while offering funding for chrome platers to transition to other methods. Hexavalent chromium is used in a number of different industries besides automotive. It\u2019s also used to increase the hardness of steel, for instance, and as an anti-corrosive agent added to paints, according to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. In 2019, green slime oozing out onto a highway near Detroit was found to be hexavalent chromium leaking from a nearby business. In that case, a Michigan environmental agency cleaned up the toxic mess. The National Association for Surface Finishing, an industry organization representing chrome platers, among others, said their industry has made a lot of progress to keep chrome plating safe for workers and the environment but acknowledged alternatives are needed. \u201cWorking collaboratively and effectively with EPA, OSHA, and state regulatory agencies, the plating industry has achieved an approximately\u00a099.9%\u00a0reduction in hexavalent chromium\u00a0air emissions since 1995\u00a0to protect the environment, human health, and worker safety,\u201d said Christian Richter, vice president for policy at NASF, in an email to CNN. \u201cNASF is working in partnership with the automotive industry to ensure a transition to the safest and most sustainable\u00a0alternatives and replacements.\u201d There are are less dangerous alternatives, Gilles said, but, for now, at least, they either don\u2019t look as good as traditional chrome plate, don\u2019t last as long, or are prohibitively expensive for mass production vehicles. For instance, trivalent chrome uses a different form of chromium and a simpler process. Falling out of love with chrome \u201cThe problem is the luster isn\u2019t as good. It has a more yellow kind of finish,\u201d Gilles said. \u201cWhereas hexavalent is extremely good, very brilliant, very clear and that\u2019s why people have come to love it. They don\u2019t realize what they\u2019re looking at, but they\u2019ve come to love it. We have to make them unlove it.\u201d The best way to do that, said Gilles, will be to entice car buyers with styles and designs that don\u2019t use chrome at all, or anything like it. There are the extremely popular \u201cblackout packages\u201d that are already available as an option on most Stellantis models. These replace all the exterior \u201cbrightwork,\u201d like chrome badges and grilles, with matte black pieces for a dark, sinister look. \u201cSometimes people go and personally convert their cars to blackout packages,\u201d Gilles said. \u201cThey call it \u2018murdered out\u2019 on the street.\u201d Years ago, Gilles even did it to his own 2016 Chrysler minivan creating a look that eventually came to market as the Chrysler Pacifica S Package with a black grille and a black-winged Chrysler logo. Black\u2019s not the only option, though. The \u201cmurdered out\u201d look doesn\u2019t work for everyone. \u201cSometimes a vehicle can look a little bit \u2018triste,\u2019 as they say in French, sad, when it\u2019s all black,\u201d said Gilles. Polished stainless steel looks a lot like chrome but it\u2019s expensive. Satin steel with a dull finish looks refined and is less expensive. Mixing different tones and textures can be even better, Gilles said. \u201cSometimes you don\u2019t want a very holistic, black and white type of contrast. Sometimes a tonal contrast is even more attractive,\u201d Gilles said. \u201cSo we\u2019re using bronzes and silvers and graphites where chrome used to be, to create that offset.\u201d Stellantis has, for years, been trying out chrome alternatives on special edition models that, generally, have done even better than expected with consumers. It\u2019s a good sign that car buyers are ready for something different. The upcoming Jeep Wagoneer S electric SUV will be one of the first Stellantis models to sport some of these new looks. It will have no chrome at all, even as an option. The same will be true on all Stellantis\u2019s other new models, Gilles said. A spokesperson for Volkswagen Group\u2019s design department \u2013 VW Group operates various brands including Audi and Bentley \u2013 said VW is also looking at alternatives to hexavalent chrome as its use becomes more strictly curtailed in various markets, including Europe. VW designers are working with finishes of various tones and textures to accent different models. \u201cWe are also using light as the new chrome,\u201d VW said in a statement shared with CNN. \u201cLight gives us more possibilities in both exterior and interior applications.\u201d Already, many VW models sport round VW logos that glow at night. Stellantis has also used glowing badges on some of its concept vehicles. It helps that the use of chrome on modern cars is already much reduced from its glaring peaks. Chrome first started appearing on cars in the 1920s as a shinier and easier to maintain alternative to nickel and, before that, brass, said the Petersen Museum\u2019s Kendall. After a few decades, it reached a \u201cmore is always better\u201d apotheosis around the same time cars sprouted fins, Gilles said. \u201cChrome peaked in the \u201950s with the big American land yachts and stuff with giant chrome bumpers and giant chrome grills. They couldn\u2019t use enough chrome,\u201d he said. \u201cThey threw as much chrome as they could at it, and we\u2019ve been weaning ourselves from it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/cars/chrome-cars-stellantis-jeep-volkswagen-vw/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "business"}}

Wall Street is being dealt a rare double feature of economic news on Wednesday, when an inflation report is due in the morning and the Federal Reserve is expected to announce what it will do with its key interest rate in the afternoon. What to expect: Investors will parse the May Consumer Price Index report on Wednesday morning, just hours before the Fed is slated to announce its monetary policy update. The CPI report and Fed\u2019s policy meeting have fallen on the same day just seven times since 2014, according to Bank of America. Despite the rare event, it\u2019s unlikely the stock market will swing widely because of the economic two-fer, some investors say. \u201cThe things that could drive volatility higher would be if Chair Powell was to say something unexpected; I think that is of a very low probability,\u201d wrote Dave Sekera, chief US market strategist at Morningstar, in a Monday note. But if \u201cinflation metrics come out much higher than expected, that could lead to a small sell-off. How much the market sells off would depend on how much above consensus inflation is running.\u201d The central bank is widely expected to keep rates on hold this month. Some analysts say upcoming CPI data won\u2019t alter the Fed\u2019s June decision, unless it shows a huge deceleration or acceleration in inflation. But the metric will still help guide the Fed\u2019s decisions during the second half of the year. \u201cThe number of rate cuts the Fed will actually be able to deliver this year will depend heavily on the outlook for inflation; if it remains stickier, investors may want to temper their expectations for easing for 2024,\u201d wrote Glenmede\u2019s investment strategy team in a Monday note. Inflation is coming down, but the path could be bumpy. Inflation showed signs of cooling in April after staying worryingly warm during the first quarter of this year. There are also signs that Americans are spending less: A second estimate of gross domestic product, released in May, showed that consumer spending was weaker in the first three months of the year than initially reported. Big-box retailers are cutting prices to entice price-conscious consumers. Investors are looking to the May CPI for clues about whether that cooldown in April\u2019s CPI report was a blip. Already, other metrics have suggested that inflation is still taking its time to come down. The April Personal Consumption Expenditures index, the central bank\u2019s preferred inflation gauge, showed the US economy made little progress keeping costs in check. US home prices are at record highs. Prices for used and new cars are still running hot, as are costs for insuring, repairing and maintaining them. The latest jobs report released Friday revealed that the US economy added an eye-popping 272,000 jobs in May. The combination of persistent inflation and strong job growth has led Wall Street to pare its expectations for rate cuts this year. Traders are expecting just one to two cuts in 2024, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. The Fed on Wednesday will release its latest projections for where it expects rates to head in the future, and, importantly, how many times it expects to ease rates in 2024. Although the central bank has stuck to its forecast for three rate cuts so far this year, that could change \u2014 and potentially become the final set of 2024 projections. \u201cIf most of the [Federal Open Market Committee] participants assume only one 25 [basis point] rate cut this year is appropriate, there would appear to be little chance of sufficient data in time to pull them back into a July or September rate cut,\u201d wrote UBS economists in a Friday note. Americans are feeling rosier about their finances, the stock market and inflation\u2019s decline Presidential election polls may be showing that some Americans have mixed, if not outright sour, views on the overall economy \u2014 but when it comes to how they view their own finances, things are looking pretty good, reports my colleague Alicia Wallace. US consumers are more optimistic about their current and future financial situation, the stock market and slowing inflation, according to survey data released Monday by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The New York Fed\u2019s May Survey of Consumer Expectations showed improvement of people\u2019s perceptions of their current financial situation as well as their outlook for a year from now. The share of respondents who said their financial situation was better than in May 2023 was at its second-highest level in more than two years, while the year-ahead positive share landed at its highest level in nearly three years. Monday\u2019s survey also showed improved optimism beyond the homefront: Notably, consumers believe the markets\u2019 good times could keep rolling. Households\u2019 expectations for highest US stock prices improved to a three-year high. In terms of the labor market, the latest survey was a little mixed. Read more here. America\u2019s rural hospitals keep getting attacked by cybercriminals. Microsoft and Google are working to fix that Microsoft and Google will offer free or discounted cybersecurity services to rural hospitals across the United States to make them less vulnerable to cyberattacks that have disrupted patient care and threatened lives, the White House and those tech firms said Monday. Microsoft said in a statement to CNN that it would provide free security updates for eligible rural hospitals, as well as security assessments and training for hospital staff. Google will provide free cybersecurity advice to rural hospitals and start a pilot program to match the firm\u2019s cybersecurity services with the needs of rural hospitals. The nation\u2019s roughly 1,800 rural community hospitals are among the most vulnerable to dangerous ransomware attacks because they often lack IT security resources and cybersecurity-trained staff, report my colleagues Sean Lyngaas and Michelle Watson. And they may be the only hospitals within dozens of miles, meaning a ransomware attack that prevents a hospital from accepting ambulances can put patients\u2019 lives at risk. The new announcement is the result of private discussions between the tech firms and officials at the White House National Security Council which has grown increasingly concerned about cyber threats to hospitals. It\u2019s an effort to use the broad reach of Microsoft and Google\u2019s software, which is used in hospitals across the United States, to help plug a gap in the defense of the health care sector.

{"id": "2024_06_13_business_faa-boeing-oversight-too-hands-off", "text": "Federal Aviation Administration chief Mike Whitaker said his agency is partly responsible for the safety problems at Boeing, admitting that it had been \u201ctoo hands off\u201d in its oversight of the troubled aircraft manufacturer. In testimony Thursday before the Senate Commerce Committee, Whitaker said that his agency now had far more inspectors on the ground at Boeing factories and the factory of its primary supplier, Spirit AeroSystems. He said it will continue to push Boeing to improve its safety culture in the wake of the January 5 incident in which a door plug blew off during an Alaska Airlines flight, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the Boeing 737 Max. But he also said that the FAA was not blameless in that incident. \u201cLet me also acknowledge the FAA should have had much better visibility into what was happening at Boeing before January 5,\u201d he said in his opening remarks to the committee. \u201cThe FAA\u2019s approach was too hands off, too focused on paperwork audits and not focused enough on inspections. We have changed that approach over the last several months. And those changes are permanent,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have now moved to a more active, comprehensive oversight model - the audit plus inspection approach.\u201d Whitaker, who was confirmed to his job heading the nation\u2019s primary aviation regulator in October, said he will be visiting Boeing\u2019s South Carolina factory himself tomorrow, and its plant that makes the 737 Max in Renton, Washington in September. Whitaker said that the FAA previously had 24 inspectors at Boeing and Spirit and that the number was in the low 30s now. Its target is 55 inspectors, although he did not give a date for when that would be in place. And he said that number could change over time. \u201cWe can no longer afford to remain reactive,\u201d he said. A preliminary report by the National Transportation Safety Board has found that bolts necessary to keep the door plug on the Alaska Air plane in place were missing from the plane at the time it left the Boeing factory in Washington roughly two months before the flight. Under questions at Thursday\u2019s hearing, Whitaker said the FAA did not have any inspectors in the factories at that time when the piece was put in. Instead the FAA staff was focused on paperwork audits instead of actual inspections. \u201cWe clearly did not have enough folks to see what was going on in that factory,\u201d he said. Safety experience\u2026 in the dairy industry But finding the inspectors could be a problem. Sen. Maria Cantwell, the Washington Democrat who is chair of the committee, questioned the backgrounds of some of the safety inspectors. \u201cI\u2019m definitely hearing \u2018We don\u2019t have enough aviation inspectors.\u2019 And \u2018We don\u2019t even have enough qualified instructors at schools,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cOne story I heard was that they said, \u2018Yes, I have safety experience. But it\u2019s in the dairy industry.\u2019 We need an aviation inspector on the floor who has aviation experience, not just safety experience.\u201d Whitaker responded that while the agency is having to provide some training for new hires, it is finding the experienced inspectors it needs for Boeing. \u201cWith respect to Boeing, we\u2019re putting our most experienced and best people on this,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly the most important issue we\u2019re dealing with right now.\u201d But for years the FAA has relied on employees of Boeing and other manufacturers to inspect their own companies, then report to the FAA, under what is known as \u201cdelegation of authority.\u201d That structure is still in place, even with more FAA employees now on the floor at Boeing factories. That reliance on self-inspection and self-certification first started getting attention in 2019 after two fatal crashes of the 737 Max killed 346 people and led to a 20-month grounding of the plane. The fact that much of the certification of the Max, a relatively new aircraft, was done by Boeing employees, not FAA staff, raised questions in Congress and an outcry among families of some of the crash victims. In January, after the Alaska Air flight, Whitaker joined those who suggested the process needed to be changed. \u201cIt is time to re-examine the delegation of authority and assess any associated safety risks,\u201d said Whitaker a week after the incident. \u201cThe grounding of the 737-9 and the multiple production-related issues identified in recent years require us to look at every option to reduce risk.\u201d In February the FAA gave Boeing 90 days to come up with a plan to improve safety. And in late May when the plan was submitted, the FAA announced it was leaving a limit on production levels in place until safety improves. \u201cThere must be a fundamental shift in the company\u2019s safety culture in order to holistically address its quality and safety challenges,\u201d Whitaker said on Thursday. \u201cThis is about systemic change, and there\u2019s a lot of work to be done.\u201d But he said there has been a shift in tone in discussions between the FAA and Boeing executives since the January incident. \u201cMy focus has been on making it clear this is a very long-term journey. You don\u2019t change the culture of an organization. We\u2019ve seen an increasing recognition that this is a long journey ahead.\u201d Boeing also said it has made significant changes since January. \u201cWe listened to our employees, engaged transparently with our regulator, welcomed the findings and recommendations from the FAA \u2026. and invited scrutiny from customers and independent experts,\u201d it said in a statement when asked for a comment on Thursday\u2019s hearing. \u201cWe will work under the FAA\u2019s oversight and uphold our responsibility to the flying public to continue delivering safe, high-quality airplanes.\u201d  This story has been updated with additional reporting and context.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/business/faa-boeing-oversight-too-hands-off/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "business"}}

The fate of the right-wing extremist\u2019s\u00a0Infowars\u00a0outlet could be decided on Friday as a Texas bankruptcy court hears a high-stakes motion filed by the families of the\u00a0Sandy Hook\u00a0victims over whether to liquidate the company. The families, who have yet to see a penny of the approximately $1.5 billion in judgments they are owed, have argued to the court that there is \u201cno prospect\u201d the company can produce a proper reorganization plan under a Chapter 11 bankruptcy. After years of waiting, they have asked the court to liquidate Jones\u2019\u00a0Free Speech Systems, the parent of Infowars. If the judge rules in favor of Sandy Hook families, Infowars would be shuttered. In such a scenario, a court-appointed trustee would be tasked with securing the assets and then selling off Jones\u2019 media empire, including the website, studio space, and broadcasting equipment. \u201cInfowars would no longer exist,\u201d\u00a0Christopher Mattei, an attorney who represents some of the Sandy Hook families, explained this week to CNN\u2019s\u00a0Hadas Gold. The process could play out quickly, denying Jones the megaphone he has used for decades to spread dangerous and hateful conspiracy theories. Since founding Infowars in the late 1990s, Jones has poisoned the public discourse with toxic commentary, most notably pushing the lie that the 2012 Newtown, Connecticut, shooting was a so-called \u201cfalse flag\u201d operation staged by the government and that the grieving family members of 20 child victims were \u201cactors.\u201d Jones, who hawks high-priced dietary supplements to his audience, has used the lies to enrich himself to the tune of millions of dollars. While juries in Texas and Connecticut punished Jones, awarding the Sandy Hook families hundreds of millions of dollars, the radical host has been able to continue operating his conspiracy empire after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Jones, who also filed for personal bankruptcy protection, moved to\u00a0liquidate his personal assets\u00a0last week, meaning that even if the judge does not order such a move for his company, it will ultimately mean he no longer owns Infowars in the future. While it\u2019s possible that the liquidation of Jones\u2019 company, if ordered by the court on Friday, could lead to its ultimate demise, a court-appointed trustee could opt to sell the company to a potential buyer. Perhaps a fellow conspiracy theorist, such as\u00a0Tucker Carlson, who is trying to gain traction with his own media startup, would be interested in purchasing the assets. But the attorneys representing Sandy Hook families expect that the most likely scenario is Jones\u2019 Infowars empire will be sold off, piece by piece, with the proceeds going to their clients. The outlet\u2019s potential demise is the latest instance in which the legal system is holding right-wing media outlets accountable for their lies. Companies operated by dishonest conspiracy profiteers rarely \u2014\u00a0if ever\u00a0\u2014 admit to wrongdoing unless they are either threatened by or face legal action, leaving the courts the only real avenue for victims of lies to correct the public record. In the last year,\u00a0Fox News\u00a0paid a historic $787.5 million settlement\u00a0to voting technology company\u00a0Dominion Voting Systems.\u00a0The Gateway Pundit\u00a0filed for bankruptcy protection.\u00a0One America News\u00a0settled a case\u00a0with voting technology company\u00a0Smartmatic.\u00a0Salem Media Group\u00a0apologized for and stopped distributing\u00a0an election denialist documentary from\u00a0Dinesh D\u2019Souza. And several cases are still pending in the legal system. While the wheels of the legal system turn slowly, they have been proven to be effective in helping victims recoup some of the damages for the lies. Of course, no monetary award can ever heal the wounds inflicted by the reprehensible lies Jones told about Sandy Hook, dishonoring the children massacred that day and tormenting their families for years. But the liquidation of Jones\u2019 assets will represent some progress. \u201cIf the judge ordered Alex Jones\u2019 business to be liquidated\u2026 that will be a moment the families can take some pride in,\u201d Mattei said. \u201cTheir objective has long been to protect their families and other families from the type of harm that Alex Jones inflicted on them for years.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/media/infowars-liquidation-alex-jones-sandy-hook-families/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk", "text": "In a year of wild tech stories that has seen Elon Musk transform Twitter, cryptocurrency exchange FTX collapse and Silicon Valley Bank implode, this week\u2019s whiplash-inducing turmoil at OpenAI is among the most captivating. Sam Altman \u2014 the leader of one of the world\u2019s most influential AI companies, OpenAI, and perhaps the\u00a0most visible figure in the fledgling industry \u2014 was fired Friday night by the startup\u2019s directors in a surprise move. Less than five days later, he\u2019s back as the company\u2019s CEO, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. The series of extraordinary events unfolded just days after OpenAI held its\u00a0first-ever developer conference, where it laid out new, commercialized versions of its technology, including the option to customize its ChatGPT AI chatbot. If you\u2019re just catching up, here\u2019s what you missed from a week so incredible you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking the script could have been written by an early version of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Friday Around 3 p.m. ET, Altman joined a Google Meet call with most of OpenAI\u2019s board that had been convened by fellow co-founder and OpenAI chief scientist\u00a0Ilya Sutskever, during which Altman was fired and told that the news would soon be made public. Within the next half hour, the board also informed Greg Brockman, another co-founder and OpenAI president, that he would be removed from the board. Around 3:30 p.m. ET, OpenAI publicly announced that it had fired Altman over concerns that he was not always truthful with the board. The board said Mira Murati, the company\u2019s chief technology officer, would become interim CEO. OpenAI\u2019s strategic partners, including its biggest financial backer Microsoft, were also reportedly informed of Altman\u2019s ouster just minutes before the board\u2019s announcement. Hours after being fired, Altman posted on X that he \u201cloved working with such talented people\u201d and that he would have \u201cmore to say about what\u2019s next later.\u201d Brockman promptly quit. \u201cPlease don\u2019t spend any time being concerned. We will be fine,\u201d Brockman\u00a0said in a Friday post\u00a0on X. \u201cGreater things coming soon.\u201d A key factor in the CEO\u2019s firing was\u00a0tension between Altman, who favored developing AI\u00a0more aggressively, and members of the OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the unfolding events. Saturday Within 24 hours of Altman being fired, reports emerged that he and other ex-OpenAI loyalists were mulling plans for their own venture. OpenAI\u2019s board was also reportedly having second thoughts and considering asking the ousted CEO to return. Sunday By Sunday afternoon, Altman was\u00a0back at OpenAI\u2019s headquarters\u00a0\u2014 this time with a guest badge \u2014 to negotiate his potential return. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reportedly mediated the discussion. A 5 p.m. PT deadline was reportedly set for the board to agree to Altman\u2019s demands, including adding a seat for Microsoft, and reinstating him as CEO. But those talks broke down. As Sunday turned into Monday, Nadella tweeted that Altman, along with Brockman, would join Microsoft to run a new AI research group. At OpenAI, the group found a new interim CEO: Emmett Shear, the former CEO of Amazon\u2019s streaming service, Twitch. Murati would return to her role as OpenAI\u2019s chief technology officer. Monday In a post on X early Monday, Shear, who left his role at Twitch in March, described the chance to join OpenAI as \u201ca once-in-a-lifetime\u201d opportunity. He added that the company would hire an independent investigator to report on what happened in the lead-up to Altman\u2019s firing. But OpenAI employees were not convinced. More than 500 staffers signed an open letter calling on the company\u2019s board to resign and reinstate Altman and Brockman. They also threatened to follow the co-founders to Microsoft if their demands were not met. Altman posted on X, saying, \u201cwe have more unity and commitment and focus than ever before. we are all going to work together some way or other, and i\u2019m so excited. one team, one mission.\u201d The drama was far from over.\u00a0The Verge reported Monday afternoon\u00a0that Altman and Brockman could still return to OpenAI if the board members who fired him resign. And Nadella, speaking to CNBC, said he was \u201copen to both options\u201d when asked whether Altman would actually join Microsoft. \u201cLook, that is for the OpenAI board and management and the employees to choose,\u201d Nadella said. \u201cWe chose to explicitly partner with OpenAI and we want to continue to do so, and obviously, that depends on the people of OpenAI staying there or coming to Microsoft.\u201d Tuesday Altman\u00a0was reinstated late Tuesday as OpenAI\u2019s CEO, the company said on X. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman\u00a0wrote\u00a0that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his\u00a0post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it has backed with billions to bolster its ambitions in developing AI. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Nadella\u00a0said\u00a0on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_01_tech_aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl", "text": "A London-based technology company is looking to \u201cdemocratize\u201d talent-identification and scouting in soccer using a mobile app. Free to download and available globally, the aiScout app allows aspiring soccer stars to enter virtual trials for professional clubs by uploading self-recorded footage of themselves completing a series of drills. It offers 75 exercises, designed to test a range of skills, with videos showing users how to complete them. Performances are automatically scored by artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The data can then be accessed by clubs, allowing their scouts to peruse scores for viable talent, honing their search with a variety of filters; from age and gender to position on the pitch. The app currently has two English Premier League (EPL) partners, Chelsea and Burnley, and clubs can tailor their in-app trials to meet specific needs and set their own benchmarks by having their academy players complete the same drills. \u201cWe\u2019re putting that data up front to make better use of [the scouts\u2019] time,\u201d said Richard Felton-Thomas, chief operating officer of ai.io, the company behind the app. \u201cTo say [to scouts], \u2018Go over to this place today because there\u2019s three players in that game that are all actually beating your Chelsea standard\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s going to be the best use of your time.\u2019\u201d It already appears to be working for some. Ben Greenwood had never had a trial with a professional club until he downloaded the app in 2019. After uploading footage of himself, the 17-year-old landed a trial with Chelsea, becoming the first user of the app to get a trial with a pro club. He signed a contract\u00a0with EPL team Bournemouth\u00a0in 2021. \u2018It\u2019s more about evolution\u2019 Having beta-tested in with players spanning 125 countries, Greenwood among them, 135 players have been trialed or signed by pro clubs or national teams through the app \u2014 which fully launched in September 2023 \u2014 according to Felton-Thomas. Just over 100,000 players make up the current database, but with over 100 clubs lined up to join Chelsea and Burnley, as well as a multi-year partnership with Major League Soccer in the US announced last May, Felton-Thomas projects user numbers to surge into the millions as the operation ramps up this year. Felton-Thomas said the \u201clion\u2019s share\u201d of its income comes from charging clubs a license fee to run the platform. Annual fees vary depending on the size of the club and the tools they require, ranging from six figures for \u201ctier one\u201d sides like Chelsea, to thousands of pounds for clubs lower down the footballing pyramid. The use of smart technology in sport continues to expand, including\u00a0AI commentary tools and wearable tech for elite athletes. The global market for sports analytics, valued at\u00a0$2.7 billion\u00a0in 2023, is projected to grow 22% by the end of the decade, according to market research firm Grand View Research. Should soccer talent scouts be concerned about being edged out by the arrival of AI in their industry? For Felton-Thomas, new technologies can co-exist with traditional methods. \u201cIt\u2019s more about evolution than revolution,\u201d Felton-Thomas explained. \u201cWe can\u2019t tell you when that player\u2019s actually in that match, how does he deal with adversity? What happens when he\u2019s 2-0 down? What happens when someone\u2019s shouting at him? What happens when he\u2019s just made a massive mistake?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got the ability to just augment real people to do their jobs better and faster, which then gives an opportunity to the player through the AI, but you\u2019re still actually just connecting them to the human on the other side, which is the club and the scout.\u201d While football remains ai.io\u2019s primary focus, the company is looking into opportunities in other sports to launch in the coming years. Further ahead, it may branch out beyond sports. \u201cYou think about the notion that you can be at home and analyze your movements, and how this could spin into health care, physical assessments for military disciplines and emergency services,\u201d Felton-Thomas told CNN.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/01/tech/aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2022_04_25_business_electric-hybrid-corvette", "text": "General Motors will produce a fully electric Chevrolet Corvette, GM President Mark Reuss announced in a LinkedIn post Monday morning.  Reuss didn\u2019t say when the electric Corvette would come, but he hinted that a hybrid model could come relatively soon. \u201cWe will offer an electrified Corvette as early as next year,\u201d he wrote. An accompanying video the company posted to Twitter showed what appeared to be a hybrid Corvette, and in another first, showed the front wheels spinning and throwing snow as if being powered. All Corvettes produced by the company previously have been rear-wheel-drive only. While Reuss\u2019s post implies a hybrid Corvette will be based on the current generation of the car, it\u2019s not clear if the all-electric version will be a variation of this car or a completely different future model. \u201cElectrified\u201d is an auto industry term encompassing everything from hybrid to fully electric vehicles, and anything with an electric motor can count as \u201celectrified.\u201d It has long been rumored that the current generation of the Corvette, the first with its gasoline engine mounted behind the seats instead of in the front, could be built with a hybrid system. Reuss has also previously hinted there would be electrified variants of the car. Various companies are working on electric sports cars. Most all-electric vehicles in production so far have been four-door sedans and SUVs, as the need for batteries lends itself to larger and heavier vehicles. Tesla\u2019s first car, the Lotus Elise-based Tesla Roadster, was an electric sports car, but the second-generation of Tesla Roadster, originally unveiled as a prototype in 2017, has yet to go into production. Some manufacturers, such as Lamborghini, have said that current battery technology doesn\u2019t allow for a optimum sports car performance from a purely electric vehicle. Lamborghini has been working on plug-in hybrid sports cars, though. To date, the Corvette is only available in the base Stingray version with 6.2-liter V8 engine producing up to 495 horsepower. A 670 horsepower Corvette Z06 with a 5.5-liter V8 was unveiled last fall. The previous generation of the Corvette included included a 755-horsepower ZR1 version. Nothing like that has yet been announced for the current model but GM engineers have said a major reason for putting the engine in the back was to allow for better performance at extremely high horsepower levels. Besides saving gas, hybrid systems can also be used in high-performance cars to add additional power and to provide for quicker acceleration since electric motors can provide power to the wheels more quickly than gas engines. Ferrari\u2019s most powerful sports cars are hybrids, for instance.   GM has said it plans to produce only zero-emission vehicles, meaning fully electric or powered by hydrogen fuel cells, by 2035.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/25/business/electric-hybrid-corvette/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit", "text": "When Apple launched its first Mac computer in 1984, with its iconic Mac smiley-face \u201chello\u201d greeting, it wanted to differentiate itself in the fledgling PC market. The Mac was approachable with its friendly, innovative design \u2013 Apple\u2019s way of setting the Mac apart in the confusing PC landscape. That consumer-friendly mantra still exists today, with Apple carefully curating an easy-breezy yet controlled user experience across its products, including the billions of iPhones used around the world. But the Biden administration believes Apple took that too far. On Thursday, the Department of Justice sued Apple for illegally monopolizing the smartphone market. In a press conference, the government provided a long list of how Apple has allegedly squashed competition with restrictive app store terms, high fees and its \u201cwalled-garden\u201d approach, restricting how third-party companies interact with its brands and services. The company denied the lawsuit\u2019s allegations and said it plans to fight them. Apple added that the lawsuit could empower the government \u201cto take a heavy hand in designing people\u2019s technology.\u201d But if successful, the lawsuit could ripple across Apple\u2019s products and services. Although the suit could take years to play out, here\u2019s a closer look what it may eventually mean for iPhone users: Changes to the App Store If found liable, the company could be forced to change a number of things. One such change is how iPhone users could get greater access to \u201csuper apps\u201d that have been largely restricted before. The term refers to one-stop-shop apps that allow for messaging, ordering food, payment processing and other capabilities all within one platform.  According to Dipanjan Chatterjee, a principal analyst at market research firm Forrester, super apps most threaten Apple\u2019s preeminence in the lives of its customers. \u201cAn offering like WeChat, dubbed China\u2019s everything app, can provide an alternative to the Apple ecosystem for people to communicate, bank, share memories, talk to businesses and more,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cWhat Apple fears most is becoming irrelevant to its customers.\u201d At the same time, super apps like WeChat are created by larger companies and could, therefore, put some smaller companies at a disadvantage. And the concept hasn\u2019t been welcomed much in the US anyway. The US government, however, could argue that lack of interest may be due to Apple\u2019s high share of the smartphone market and its resistance to offer super apps in its store, Chatterjee said. Better interoperability Apple may also be required to offer more support for cross-platform messaging, an issue the company previously said it\u2019s already working on. The company lets iPhone users send high-quality photos and videos to one another, but similar texts to Android phones are slower and grainy. It also maintains those messages in green bubbles, creating a kind of class divide, critics argue. In November, the company said it will add new features, such as read receipts, typing indicators, better support for group chats and higher quality media sharing of images and videos, across platforms to help close the gap. Apple\u2019s move to add support for the standard called RCS (rich communication services) is intended to roll out later this year. RCS is considered the replacement to alternatives such as SMS, or short messaging service, and can work over both Wi-Fi and mobile data. The change followed pressure from both regulators and competitors to more seamlessly work across operating systems. The European Union\u2019s Digital Markets Act, for example, requires companies to make their key services interoperable between platforms. The US government could require the same. More open services Another likely change is how hardware from other companies, such as smartwatches, will interact with the Apple range of devices and software, including the iPhone and Apple\u2019s services like Fitness+. The company has also required Apple Watch users to own iOS devices as a way to keep them locked into its existing ecosystem. Chatterjee said making this change would have both positives and negatives. \u201cThe net result would reside somewhere along the spectrum of access to more and cheaper options but also the devaluation of the customer experience that is so highly prized by Apple\u2019s customers,\u201d he said. The Biden administration has also taken issue with Apple\u2019s lack of support for mobile cloud services. Loosening this could allow users to access games and other cloud-based apps without having to pay for pricey hardware. Inside the debate The DOJ lawsuit claims Apple\u2019s behavior has illegally hindered competition, kept its customers locked into its products and prevented other companies from innovating. Although the Biden administration will have to prove these harms, some critics say any potential changes Apple could make will negatively impact the user experience. David McQueen, a research director at ABI Research, said he recognizes that the content and applications market should be open, and Apple needs to avoid monopolistic advantages that can restrict competition, push up prices or block innovation. But Apple\u2019s success stems in part to its tight grip on its products and services, keeping things intuitive and seamless. \u201cIf Apple is forced to comply, it could potentially spell the end to the provision of this consistent and unified user experience, although by the same token, consumers will be open to a greater choice of apps and services, helping more developers and providers,\u201d McQueen said. Chatterjee noted some people are drawn to the Apple family of products precisely because of the carefully managed ecosystem\u2019s ease of use. Apple may have to work that much harder to preserve the integrity of its experience, but any changes probably won\u2019t be enough to make customers to leave and go elsewhere. \u201cThe vast majority of Apple customers would probably be happier with some more choice and lower prices as long as it did not hamper their levels of customer experience, which is threatened by the less control Apple has over the experience,\u201d Chatterjee said. But he added those currently outside of the Apple ecosystem will likely benefit by \u201cplugging in opportunistically without having to go all in with Apple.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_business_boeing-737-max-dutch-roll-investigation", "text": "Federal authorities and Boeing are trying to figure out why a 737 Max 8 experienced a rare, unsafe back-and-forth roll during flight. The oscillating motion is known as a Dutch roll, and one characteristic described by the Federal Aviation Administration is the nose of an aircraft making a figure-eight. There were no injuries onboard Southwest Airlines flight 746 on May 25, according to the airline and a preliminary report by the FAA. The report said the crew \u201cregained control,\u201d and the plane safely landed. But the aircraft suffered \u201csubstantial\u201d damage and the FAA classified the incident as an \u201caccident.\u201d The FAA report said an inspection \u201crevealed damage to the standby PCU,\u201d or power control unit, which controls the rudder. It is unclear if the damaged unit led to or was a result of the roll. The plane has not flown since landing in Oakland, California after the incident, except to move it to a Boeing facility in Washington state. Boeing did not immediately comment to CNN. Southwest told CNN it referred the incident to the FAA and National Transportation Safety Board and is participating in and supporting the investigation. The incident occurred almost three weeks ago and was added to a FAA database this week. There were 175 passengers and six crew onboard, according to the airline. The NTSB confirmed it has opened an investigation into this incident. Investigators have downloaded data from the flight data recorder, which \u201cwill aid investigators in determining the length and severity of the event.\u201d Voice recordings from the voice data recorder \u2013 the other of the so-called black boxes - were overwritten. In February, the FAA required airlines flying some 737 Max 8 and similar aircraft to inspect the rudder assembly for loose or missing nut, washer and bolt. It said the flaw would prevent the pilots from controlling the rudder using foot pedals. Authorities have not said if this condition and the Dutch roll last month are related. An unusual motion Most passengers have never felt a plane make this movement \u2014 and most airline pilots have never experienced it in actual flight. \u201cIt\u2019s very obscure,\u201d aviation safety analyst and former airline pilot Kathleen Bangs told CNN.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s a very uncomfortable movement and you feel the tail swinging around.\u201d While moving forward in flight, airplanes can pivot along three axis:\u00a0Nose up and down, known as pitch; wings dipping down or raising up, known as roll;\u00a0and the tail shifting left or right, known as yaw. Airliners turn using a typically seamless combination of roll and yaw coordinated by the aircraft\u2019s computers. These large aircraft also have yaw dampers that make small adjustments throughout flight. In the Dutch roll, the plane both rolls and yaws excessively.\u00a0Passengers would feel the plane shift to one side, and back to the other \u2014 moving back and forth, Bangs said. She said airline pilots train for scenarios where their yaw dampers fail.\u00a0They could take an aircraft simulator to a high altitude and turn off the yaw damper. \u201cThen you stomp on a rudder pedal really hard to try to initiate [the roll] in the simulator,\u201d Bangs said. To get out of a Dutch roll, pilots can slow the aircraft and descend to thicker air. Modern airliners are designed to be inherently stable in air, she said, so the plane may return to level flight with minimal additional input. But the forces can be powerful. In 1959, four of the eight occupants on a Boeing 707 test and training flight were killed just outside of Washington, DC, after extremely steep Dutch rolls. \u201cThe aircraft immediately yawed and rolled violently to the right,\u201d reads a report from the Civil Aeronautics Board, which investigated the incident. \u201cSeveral gyrations followed and after control of the aircraft was regained, it was determined that three of the four engines had separated from the aircraft and it was on fire.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/business/boeing-737-max-dutch-roll-investigation/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "business"}}

The probe, first reported by the New York Times Friday, is the latest black eye for the aerospace industry, which has had a series of problems recently with the quality and safety issues involving jets. The investigation comes after small holes were discovered in the material, apparently from corrosion, according to the Times report.

Our analysis shows the in-service fleet can continue to fly safely.\u201d Spirit said the investigation is looking into counterfeit documents that allowed the questionable titanium to enter the supply chain. \u201cWhen this was identified, all suspect parts were quarantined and removed from Spirit production,\u201d said Joe Buccino, a spokesperson for Spirit. \u201cMore than 1,000 tests have been completed to confirm the mechanical and metallurgical properties of the affected material to ensure continued airworthiness.\u201d Airbus said it is aware of the situation. \u201cNumerous tests have been performed on parts coming from the same source of supply,\u201d it said in its statment. \u201cThey show that the A220\u2019s airworthiness remains intact.\u201d\u00a0 The FAA said it trying to determine the safety implications to planes that were made using the parts. It is unclear how many planes have parts made with the questionable material, according to the Times, which said among the planes with the parts were the Boeing 737 Max and 787 Dreamliner and the Airbus 220. \u201cBoeing reported a voluntary disclosure to the FAA regarding procurement of material through a distributor who may have falsified or provided incorrect records,\u201d the statement said. \u201cBoeing issued a bulletin outlining ways suppliers should remain alert to the potential of falsified records.\u201d Besides stirring concerns among passengers about the safety of flying, the growing list of problems for the aviation industry have reduced the capacity of planes available to fly, and thus put upward pressure of airfares in the face of strong demand for air travel globally. The most serious and high profile problems involve Boeing, \u00a0which had two fatal crashes of its 737 Max due to a design flaw in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people and led to a 20-month grounding of the jet. More recently a door plug blew off an Alaska Airlines 737 Max flight on January 5, forcing the plane to land with a gaping hole in its side. Airbus has also had problems with some of the engines that have grounded some of its planes owned by different airlines.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/business/faa-probe-counterfeit-titanium-boeing-airbus/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_22_media_ronna-mcdaniel-nbc", "text": "NBC News on Friday announced that it had hired Ronna McDaniel, the former Republican National Committee chair who has repeatedly\u00a0attacked the network and its journalists,\u00a0assailed the\u00a0news\u00a0media as \u201cfake news\u201d and promoted false claims around the 2020\u00a0vote,\u00a0as an on-air commentator\u00a0ahead of the 2024 presidential election. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be a more important moment to have a voice like Ronna\u2019s on the team,\u201d Carrie Budoff Brown, senior vice president of politics at NBC News, said in a memo\u00a0to staff. McDaniel exited the RNC earlier this month after leading the organization since 2016. During her time as chair, McDaniel repeatedly attacked the press, which has become increasingly popular in Republican circles over the last several years as Donald Trump demonizes journalists and news institutions. McDaniel echoed many such attacks, labeling the press as \u201cfake news\u201d and calling the media \u201ccorrupt.\u201d At times, she even targeted NBC News\u00a0and MSNBC\u00a0with dishonest attacks. In 2019, for instance, McDaniel accused Richard Engel, NBC News\u2019 chief foreign correspondent, of \u201cactively cheering for an economic downturn.\u201d \u201cHow can NBC let him keep his job when he\u2019s made his bias so clear?\u201d McDaniel asked. McDaniel has a lengthier history attacking the progressive cable news channel MSNBC, which she will appear on in her new role. In recent years, she has repeatedly attacked the channel for \u201cspreading lies\u201d and blasted those she described as the network\u2019s \u201cprimetime propagandists.\u201d An NBC spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment about her attacks on the news media and NBC. In her role as RNC chief, McDaniel also fanned the flames of election denialism after the 2020 presidential contest. McDaniel was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d The Michigan Department of State\u2019s office condemned her claims of supposed voter fraud in the wake of the election, stating they had \u201cno merit.\u201d\u00a0The state\u2019s \u201celections were conducted fairly, effectively and transparently and are an accurate reflection of the will of Michigan voters,\u201d it said in a\u00a0detailed fact check\u00a0posted online. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Chris Wallace last year, McDaniel defended her claims of voting \u201cirregularity\u201d in the election. \u201cI think saying that there were problems with 2020 is very real. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s election denying,\u201d McDaniel told Wallace. \u201cI\u2019m from Wayne County. We had a woman send a note saying I\u2019m being told to backdate ballots. We had to look into that. That\u2019s deeply concerning. When you have friends who are poll-watching and being kicked out, that\u2019s deeply concerning. We have every right to look at that.\u201d In the interview,\u00a0Wallace pressed McDaniel if she believed Biden legitimately won the election. \u201cI think there were lots of problems with 2020. Ultimately, he won the election\u00a0but there were lots of problems with the 2020 election,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think he won it fair. I don\u2019t. I\u2019m not going to say that.\u201d NBC\u2019s hiring of McDaniel, however, plays into a recent trend at the\u00a0network\u2019s outlets, which has seemingly softened its stance on Trump as he inches toward the Republican nomination for president. Earlier this month, CNBC hosted Trump for a lengthy phone interview in which the network\u2019s anchors allowed him to peddle lies and conspiracy theories on air\u00a0without scrutiny. MSNBC has even started carrying Trump\u2019s remarks live on television, a practice that the network boasted for years it would not do. Star host Rachel Maddow, who has said carrying Trump\u2019s lies\u00a0on the air\u00a0is dangerous, even objected to the network broadcasting a recent speech from the presumptive Republican nominee, calling it \u201cirresponsible.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/22/media/ronna-mcdaniel-nbc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_economy_ppi-wholesale-inflation-may", "text": "Americans and the Federal Reserve have another positive development to celebrate: More evidence that price pressures are fading. Wholesale inflation cooled significantly in May, with prices down 0.2% from April\u2019s 0.5% increase, according to data the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Thursday. Economists polled by FactSet had anticipated a 0.1% rise in monthly wholesale inflation. A 4.8% in energy prices last month was a major contributor to falling overall wholesale prices. The Producer Price Index, which measures the change in prices that manufacturers pay to suppliers, rose 2.2% for the 12 months ended in May, matching April\u2019s increase. FactSet consensus estimates had the annual increase at 2.5%. Excluding food and energy prices, so-called \u201ccore\u201d producer inflation rose 2.3% on an annual basis, the same level seen in April. Economists were expecting to see a larger acceleration of 2.5%. On a monthly basis, core inflation was flat, also unchanged from April, while economists had forecast a 0.3% rise. PPI captures average price shifts before they reach consumers and serves as a potential bellwether for retail-level inflation in the months ahead. On the goods side, deflation effects were even stronger, with prices falling 0.8% in May, the largest monthly decline since October 2023. On the services side, prices rose 0.6%, the same level seen in April. The new inflation data follows May\u2019s Consumer Price Index released Wednesday, which showed that the pace of price increase consumers see across goods and services cooled to 3.3% from 3.4% in April. On a monthly basis, prices held flat for the first time since July 2022. On the same day, Federal Reserve officials voted to keep interest rates at current levels, which are the highest in 23 years. But they still kept the door open to cutting interest rates later this year, albeit fewer times than they indicated at March\u2019s meeting, according to new median projections. Fed officials did not have access to Thursday\u2019s data when they met. But Fed Chair Jerome Powell said he\u2019d be paying close attention to it for clues about the path of inflation. To cut or not to cut? Some market observers saw Thursday\u2019s data as a sign that the Fed will gain more of the confidence it needs to feel comfortable lowering interest rates. \u201cIt keeps the prospect of a rate cut alive in 2024,\u201d Clark Bellin, president and chief investment officer at Bellwether Wealth, said in a note Thursday morning. If the trend seen in May\u2019s PPI data continues, said Jamie Cox, managing partner for Harris Financial Group, it could lead the Fed to cut rates as soon as September. But others expressed concerns that the fall in producer prices may actually represent a negative consequence. \u201cThe better readings on inflation this month look like they are only occurring because economic growth has stalled and the\u00a0country is in danger of going over a cliff,\u201d said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FwdBonds. \u201cThis is exactly what an economy looks like when the country enters a recession and it will be a miracle if we miss one. The Fed missed the inflation outbreak and now it looks increasingly like they misread the risks of recession and soaring job losses,\u201d Rupkey said in a note Thursday. Potential evidence of a weakening economy was seen in Thursday\u2019s weekly jobless claims data. Initial jobless claims rose by 13,000 to 242,000 for the week ending June 8, the highest level in 10 months \u2014 though the data is volatile and can be frequently revised. Stocks opened mixed after the release of PPI and jobless claims data. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 250 points lower, or 0.6%, in morning trading; while the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 opened slightly higher. The latter two indexes both closed at fresh record highs on Wednesday.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/economy/ppi-wholesale-inflation-may/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_business_raytheon-lawsuit-job-discrimination", "text": "A class action lawsuit filed Tuesday alleges that RTX Corporation, the multinational aerospace and defense systems giant formerly known as Raytheon Technologies, has been discriminating against job seekers who are 40 years or older. The complaint, filed by the AARP Foundation and two law firms at the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts, asserts that the language used in certain Raytheon job ads indicates a preference for younger workers in violation of the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the Massachusetts Fair Employment Practices Act and the Virginia Human Rights Act. The company had been headquartered in Massachusetts and recently relocated to Virginia. \u201cThe language and content of these job advertisements discourages and deters many older workers from even applying for the Recent Graduate Positions and prevents older workers who do apply from advancing in the hiring process because too much time has passed since they graduated \u2026 \u00a0and/or entered the workforce,\u201d the complaint said. The ads that refer to \u201cRecent Graduate Positions\u201d indicate that applicants should either have graduated from college or graduate school very recently or have no more than 12 or 24 months of related work experience. While the positions may be lower level, they are not necessarily low paying, with salary ranges that can run north of $100,000. In response, RTX rejected the premise of the allegations. \u201cRTX complies with all relevant age discrimination laws and we\u2019re committed to maintaining a diverse workforce. We believe these claims are entirely without merit and we will actively defend our hiring practices,\u201d company spokesman Chris Johnson told CNN. The suit currently has just one named plaintiff \u2014 Mark H. Goldstein \u2014 but is brought on behalf of \u201call others similarly situated.\u201d More named individuals may join the suit later, said Peter Romer-Friedman, one of the lead lawyers on the case. Goldstein, 67, has roughly four decades of experience in \u201cproject management, cybersecurity, technology, risk management, security engineering, sales, marketing, engineering, business, and consulting,\u201d according to the complaint. In addition, it said, Goldstein has experience as a contractor for the US Department of Homeland Security, has held a federal government security clearance and has two key information security and privacy certifications. Between 2019 and 2023, Goldstein applied to at least seven of Raytheon\u2019s recent graduate positions for which he met all the qualifications save those requiring the newness of his degrees or the short duration of work experience. \u201cDespite the fact that Mr. Goldstein has been genuinely interested in a position with Raytheon, committed to relocating, if necessary, and has skills that Raytheon needs to address a years\u2019 long labor shortage, Raytheon has not hired Mr. Goldstein for any of the positions to which he applied, has never offered him an interview, and has failed to seriously consider Mr. Goldstein\u2019s applications based on his age,\u201d the complaint said. Goldstein had filed a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 2019. In 2021, the EEOC declared in a letter that its \u201cinvestigation revealed that [Mr. Goldstein] was denied the opportunity to be considered for the [Recent Graduate Positions] he had applied for because of his age, and not because he did not meet the minimum qualifications required for the jobs,\u201d according to the complaint. \u201cIt also found that Raytheon\u2019s discriminatory advertisements had violated the ADEA, explaining that: \u2018EEOC believes [Raytheon\u2019s] job advertisements included language that violates the ADEA in that it indicated a hiring preference for applicants who are not in the protected age group.\u2019\u201d In response to the EEOC\u2019s 2021 determination, Raytheon tweaked some language in job ads, but in ways that still discriminate against older job seekers, the complaint alleges. Goldstein filed a second charge of discrimination with the EEOC in July 2023. The agency is still investigating that matter, Romer-Friedman noted.

{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_judges-stern-rebuke-of-elon-musks-x-gives-researchers-fresh-hope", "text": "A federal judge\u2019s decision this week reprimanding Elon Musk\u2019s X will have reverberating effects on efforts to hold influential online platforms accountable, legal experts and advocacy groups say. On Monday, District Judge Charles Breyer dismissed and excoriated a lawsuit by X against online watchdog group Center for Countering Digital Hate as an attempt to silence the non-profit group for sounding alarms about hate speech on the platform. Breyer wrote in Monday\u2019s order that the lawsuit was \u201cunabashedly\u201d about \u201cpunishing\u201d reports written by CCDH, which X had accused of campaigning to drive away its advertisers. Breyer held that the reports were \u201cunquestionably\u201d protected by the group\u2019s free speech rights. Now, that decision could embolden other research groups and Musk critics who have faced legal threats from the billionaire. The CCDH case \u2014 in the US District Court for the Northern District of California \u2014\u00a0has been widely viewed as a bellwether for research and accountability on X, where Musk has restored the accounts of previously banned White supremacists and spreaders of misinformation and where Musk himself has amplified various conspiracy theories. And CCDH is not the only organization that has faced attacks by self-proclaimed \u201cfree speech absolutist\u201d Musk after criticizing or raising concerns about his platform. \u201cThis is an important decision that sees Elon Musk\u2019s lawsuit for what it is \u2014 an effort to punish his critics for constitutionally protected speech and to deter researchers from studying his platform,\u201d said Alex Abdo, litigation director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, which had filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the case arguing that private companies should not be allowed to use breach of contract claims to punish criticism. \u201cSociety needs reliable and ethical research into social media platforms, and often that research relies on being able to study publicly available posts,\u201d Abdo said. X said it plans to appeal Breyer\u2019s decision. Musk\u2019s threats against X critics In his first year as owner of X, formerly known as Twitter, Musk threatened legal action against the Anti-Defamation League for defamation, as well as against Microsoft and Meta for allegedly improper data and trade secret access, respectively. None of those threats ever amounted to real lawsuits. He did, however, sue the progressive media watchdog Media Matters over its\u00a0analysis\u00a0highlighting antisemitic and pro-Nazi content on X, alleging that the group\u2019s testing methodology was not representative of how real users experience the site and that the report was designed to drive away advertisers. Legal experts have described that case as \u201cweak\u201d on the merits and as a \u201cbogus\u201d attempt to chill criticism of X. This week\u2019s court decision may be only a temporary setback in Musk\u2019s wider plan to stifle criticism, said Media Matters CEO Angelo Carusone. Musk\u2019s new playbook, Carusone said, enlists the help of sympathetic Republican attorneys general to investigate independent reporting organizations and tie them up in legal proceedings. The states of Texas and Missouri each announced probes into Media Matters following X\u2019s lawsuit against the group, to which Musk responded, \u201cGreat!\u201d As recently as Monday, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey filed a petition in state court seeking to compel Media Matters\u2019 cooperation with his investigation. The filing came a week after he appeared with Musk in a live event on X \u2014 which Carusone said shows how Musk hopes to deputize the power of government to silence his critics. \u201cThey have every reason to do it,\u201d Carusone said of the AGs\u2019 investigations. \u201cThey get the political benefits, they get the attention. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any cost to them yet. And if they are successful at developing this new playbook, this new terrain, legally, then it\u2019s going to pave the way for them to just use this tool and tactic over and over and over again.\u201d A representative for X did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Carusone\u2019s claims. Researchers face hurdles to studying on-platform behavior Researchers from non-profits and academic institutions have had a harder time studying X since Musk\u2019s takeover in 2022. Academics need large samples of posts, shares, likes and other data to study social media trends in mis- and disinformation, public health, elections and other key topics. But one of Musk\u2019s first changes at X was to put access to platform data behind a steep paywall. Researchers and civil society groups said the new subscription fees \u2014 costing up to $2.5 million a year \u2014\u00a0were \u201coutrageously expensive\u201d and made it impossible to do their work, reducing transparency of a critical platform. The change may have forced some researchers to rely more heavily on first-person observational data to draw conclusions about user behavior on X. Groups like CCDH have also used automated \u201cscraping\u201d of publicly viewable content from X rather than paying the company for data directly, a tactic that helped give rise to X\u2019s initial lawsuit. Efforts by X and other social media companies to limit research transparency makes them less accountable to the public at best and, at worst, could mask malicious behavior, said David Karpf, an associate professor in the School of Media and Public Affairs at George Washington University. \u201cWe need independent research to have any real measure of what\u2019s going on at X/Twitter. Musk is only ever going to release data that makes his company look good,\u201d Karpf said. \u201cThese platforms are too big and too vital to the spread of information to be left unmonitored.\u201d \u201cThis is an election year,\u201d Karpf added, \u201cand the platforms are taking steps to make it harder to monitor how their services are used for malignant ends.\u201d Free Press, another media accountability organization that has been critical of Musk\u2019s leadership of X and which called for advertisers to pause their spending on the platform shortly after his takeover, also celebrated Breyer\u2019s ruling as potentially removing at least one hurdle that watchdog organizations face. \u201cThe guardrails for democracy are hanging by a thread and we have dwindling insights into platform practices as researchers face lawsuits, congressional subpoenas and other scare tactics,\u201d said Nora Benavidez, senior counsel and director of digital rights at Free Press. Ultimately, Benavidez called the ruling \u201ca reminder that platform accountability is essential and will inevitably prevail when up against bullies like Musk who try to silence us.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/judges-stern-rebuke-of-elon-musks-x-gives-researchers-fresh-hope/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "business"}}

Areas of the country that produce a lot of rice and wheat have been badly affected, disrupting spring and summer planting seasons. The Ministry of Agriculture said Thursday that drought and heat have had an adverse impact on the planting season in some northern and central provinces, and it warned that temperatures were expected to surpass 35 Celsius (95 Fahrenheit) in the coming days. An emergency alert covering at least seven provinces, including the major agricultural regions of Henan and Shandong, was already in place because of dry, hot conditions. \u201cThe recent persistently high temperatures have accelerated the loss of water in the soil and (caused) drought in some areas, which has negatively affected the summer sowing season,\u201d the ministry said in a statement. \u201cThe drought is likely to continue and the task of protecting the summer planting season is difficult.\u201d In Henan, China\u2019s top wheat producing region which accounts for a quarter of total output, rainfall in May was 70% lower than the yearly average, Yang Wentao, a provincial official, told national broadcaster CCTV on Wednesday. Parts of the country are experiencing a major heat wave. The China Meteorological Administration (CMA) said on Wednesday that 28 regional weather stations broke their respective records for the highest temperature ever recorded in mid June. The city of Fenyang in the northern province of Shanxi registered its highest temperature ever recorded at 40.2 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit). China had its hottest spring on record this year. The national average temperature between March and May reached 12.3 degrees Celsius, the highest since records began in 1961, with 12 national meteorological stations registering temperatures reaching or surpassing records, according to\u00a0the National Climate Center. Last year was the country\u2019s hottest year on record. Meanwhile, southern parts of the country, the top rice growing region, have been grappling with weeks of downpours. In April, the Ministry of Agriculture said in a statement that rainfall in parts of the region had risen by 50% to 80%, and had even doubled in some areas. It made a series of recommendations on reducing damage to growing \u201cearly rice\u201d saplings, which are planted in March and harvested in June. The CMA said on Thursday that heavy rainfall had occurred in the Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangxi and Guizhou regions \u2014 some of them major manufacturing and industrial centers.

China\u2019s State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters, a national coordination agency, issued an emergency response to both the flooding in the south and the drought in the north on Thursday, warning of a high risk of flash floods and geologic hazards.

{"id": "business_apple-lawsuit-gender-pay-discrimination", "text": "Two female employees at Apple sued the company on Thursday, alleging the company paid women less than men for the same work. The women are proposing a class action, seeking to represent more than 12,000 current and former female employees in the engineering, marketing and AppleCare divisions. Apple is not the first major tech company to face legal challenges for alleged gender discrimination. Google in 2018 agreed to pay $118 million to settle a class action gender discrimination lawsuit, and Oracle agreed to pay $25 million to settle a class action alleging underpaying female employees. Neither company admitted wrongdoing. The lawsuit centers on Apple\u2019s hiring practices and performance evaluations, which the women allege pushed a wage gap between men and women. California made it illegal for employers to ask job candidates about their prior pay in 2018. Instead, since January 2018, Apple asked about pay expectations, the lawsuit says. The lawsuit alleges that Apple used the pay expectation information to set starting salaries, which had lower pay rates for women compared to men who did similar work. The lawsuit also claims that the performance evaluations are biased against women, because parameters such as teamwork and leadership tend to reward men and punish women. This can affect women\u2019s promotions and bonuses, the lawsuit alleged. Justina Jong, a customer and technical training instructor and one of two plaintiffs, said in a release from her attorneys that she noticed a W-2 left on the office printer by a male colleague. \u201cI noticed that he was being paid almost $10,000 more than me, even though we performed substantially similar work. This revelation made me feel terrible,\u201d Jong said in a statement. The lawsuit also alleges that Jong was forced to work in a hostile work environment next to a co-worker who had sexually harassed her. The other plaintiff, Amina Salgado, said she complained to Apple numerous times about the wage gap, according to the lawsuit. Salgado has worked in several roles for Apple since 2012, according to the suit. Eventually, she said, Apple hired a third-party firm to conduct an investigation, which found that she was paid less. \u201cAs a result of the third-party investigation, in late 2023, Apple increased Ms. Salgado\u2019s compensation prospectively, but failed and refused to pay Ms. Salgado back pay for the years during which she was paid less than men performing substantially similar work,\u201d the lawsuit alleged.

{"id": "2024_06_14_economy_gas-prices-down-since-last-summer", "text": "Exactly two years ago Friday, gasoline prices peaked at a record of $5.02 a gallon nationally. The gas spike of 2022 crushed consumer confidence, spooked investors and put a hole in family budgets. It helped propel the national inflation rate to 9% for the first time since the early 1980s. \u201cFive-dollar gas sent shockwaves through the system. No American outside of California had ever seen five-dollar gas before,\u201d said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy. Gas prices today are not cheap \u2013 but they are miles away from that point. The national average for regular gas stood at $3.46 a gallon on Thursday, according to AAA. Not only is that down $1.56 from the record set in June 2022, it\u2019s down 13 cents from this point last year. \u201cWe\u2019ve come a long way. We\u2019re in a much healthier and balanced market than two years ago,\u201d said De Haan. Of course, gas prices were cheaper during the Covid-19 pandemic because demand was severely low. Even in June 2021, the national average was a bit lower, at about $3.08 a gallon. Driving down inflation Gas prices peaked this spring at $3.68 a gallon on April 19. The fact that prices have moved steadily lower since then has helped take pressure off cash-strapped consumers. Cooler gas prices have also played a central role in helping to drive down inflation. The Bureau of Labor Statistics said this week that monthly consumer prices were unchanged between April and May for the first time in nearly two years. One of the biggest catalysts was the fact that prices at the pump have become cheaper. Easing inflation has kept alive hopes that the Federal Reserve will be able to start cutting interest rates at least once before the end of the year. That, in turn, would give borrowers a break from historically high rates on mortgages, credit cards and car loans. There could be political implications, too. In part because they are so visible, gas prices play a key psychological role in how people feel about the economy. It\u2019s not clear if voters will \u2014 or even should \u2014 credit the White House for falling gas prices. However, a spike to $4 would likely have negative consequences for President Joe Biden\u2019s reelection campaign, since it would feed concerns about the high cost of living and further dent relatively low consumer confidence. \u201cGas prices are so central to how people think about their financial situation. They are the single most important variable in terms of how people are doing \u2014 especially low-income households,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics. Drivers in some states are paying much less than a year ago for gasoline, including Utah (69 cents), Washington (47 cents) and Idaho (38 cents). There are also significant 12-month price drops in some key battleground states such as Arizona (59 cents), Wisconsin (33 cents) and Nevada (24 cents), according to AAA. \u201cAs the summer driving season continues, Americans are seeing gas prices drop around the country,\u201d White House spokesperson Angelo Fern\u00e1ndez Hern\u00e1ndez told CNN in a statement. \u201cBut there is more work to be done \u2014 the President remains committed to lowering prices at the pump for Americans and maintaining a stable and secure energy supply.\u201d Real gas prices are cheaper than in 2018 Many people may wish for the $2 gas prices of last decade. Of course, people are making more money than they were a decade ago, so it\u2019s not a fair comparison. Yet, on an inflation-adjusted basis, gas prices are right in line with where they were before Covid. Real (inflation-adjusted) gas prices stood at $3.34 a gallon in June 2019 and $3.61 in June 2018, according to the US Energy Information Administration. The current national average of $3.46 is in the middle of that. Although the White House spokesperson noted \u201chistoric investments\u201d in clean energy, he also acknowledged that \u201crecord domestic oil and gas production is helping to meet our immediate needs.\u201d Indeed, even though the oil industry frequently battles with the White House over regulation, US oil output is off the charts. Powered by the shale oil boom, the United States produced 13.2 million barrels of crude oil per day in March, according to federal statistics. That\u2019s just shy of the record 13.3 million in November. \u201cJust think about where gasoline prices would be without US shale,\u201d said Rob Thummel, senior portfolio manager at energy investment firm Tortoise. Oil prices are higher than at this point last year, in part because OPEC+ continues to restrain production. That also reflects concerns about both the war in Ukraine and the Israel-Gaza war. Gas prices, however, have been guided lower by improving stockpiles of gasoline. \u201cIt\u2019s all about inventories,\u201d Thummel said. \u201cInventories are likely headed back to normal levels, which will keep gasoline prices lower throughout the summer driving season. That\u2019s good news for consumers.\u201d GasBuddy\u2019s De Haan noted that gas prices have been on the low end of what his firm was forecasting for June, in part because fewer people are driving. If a hurricane or oil price shock is avoided, De Haan said gas prices should remain subdued. (Experts have forecast a hyperactive Atlantic hurricane season this year.) \u201cIt\u2019s a good outcome \u2014 dare I say a better-than-expected outcome,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/economy/gas-prices-down-since-last-summer/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_tech_apple-openai-partnership", "text": "When OpenAI CEO Sam Altman attended Apple\u2019s annual developer conference this week, he walked the campus, mingling with current and former executives, including Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak. Nearly an hour later, the iPhone maker announced a much-rumored partnership with OpenAI to bring its ChatGPT technology to devices later this year. But Altman, who has emerged as the poster child for generative AI in the 18 months since the launch of ChatGPT, was not featured in Apple\u2019s formal presentation, neither in person or via livestream. Nor did he join Apple CEO Tim Cook and other executives in a private press event about privacy and security and the partnership between the two companies. \u201cI was not surprised Sam Altman did not appear on stage,\u201d said Ben Wood, an analyst at market research firm CCS Insight in an interview with CNN. \u201cApple had to manage the message carefully. OpenAI is merely the vehicle to address broader AI-powered inquiries that are not core to the Apple experience. Having him in the livestream would have only created an unnecessary level of confusion.\u201d Earlier this week, Apple showed off a handful of AI-powered features coming to the iPhone, iPad and Mac in the fall \u2013 the majority of which are fueled by the company\u2019s own proprietary technology, called Apple Intelligence. The company will offer OpenAI\u2019s viral ChatGPT tool in a limited capacity, usually only when Siri is activated and needs more assistance answering an inquiry. The move to invite Altman to the announcement but not have him appear before the public also represents in some ways how Apple is cautiously moving forward with the partnership. OpenAI, along with other AI companies, continues to face concerns from researchers, industry experts and government officials around misinformation, biases, copyright, privacy and security, and more. The deal also comes at a time when the industry is moving quickly, and government regulators, companies and consumers are still figuring out how to engage with the technology responsibly. Apple hopes that a big push into AI could spur growth for iPhone sales as the device has languished without a major upgrade for years and users are now waiting longer to upgrade their devices as a result. An uncertain economic environment is also weighing on consumers, particularly in China. The company also faces regulatory scrutiny in Washington and was recently passed by chip maker Nvidia as the second-largest public company in the US. In the 60 hours after Apple\u2019s Monday event, however, the company\u2019s stock price (AAPL) rose by as much as 10%, boosting Apple\u2019s market capitalization by more than $300 billion, rocketing past Nvidia and putting Apple back in contention with Microsoft for largest market value. The timing is further noteworthy: Apple is not always first to adopt and integrate emerging technologies \u2014 it typically researches, develops and aims to perfect new tech for years before including it in new products \u2014 but the speed at which the world is adopting generative AI is perhaps expediting the company\u2019s need to have a smartphone with the latest buzzy technology. \u201cApple needed to deliver an AI story and Apple Intelligence should help placate nervous investors and reassure them that Apple is keeping pace with its rivals,\u201d Wood added. \u201cThe partnership with ChatGPT is a major development which beefs up Apple\u2019s AI offerings, and new features like a significantly improved Siri will be welcome to users.\u201d But the partnership could also open Apple up to some vulnerability, as it has no control over OpenAI\u2019s models or what it does with user inputs. Apple alignment with a company and a technology that have yet to win public trust could also cause some challenges down the road. A limited partnership Although Apple has been working on its own AI program for years, a partnership with OpenAI marks a way for it to fill in the competitive gaps. When a user has a question beyond Siri\u2019s scope, ChatGPT can step in. In the demo following the keynote, Apple showed CNN how someone could upload a picture of vegetables at a farmer\u2019s market and ask what they could make for dinner. Siri may suggest that the question is better suited for ChatGPT, and provide the user with a prompt to give consent to use the service. Apple using ChatGPT as a complimentary service could potentially cut down on risks associated with the company. It\u2019s also very possible Apple could partner with other AI companies in the future too, such as Google\u2019s Gemini or more niche providers with certain expertise, such as in healthcare. \u201cI think Apple will take a pragmatic approach to the OpenAI partnership,\u201d Wood said. \u201cIf Apple finds that the relationship with OpenAI starts to affect the overall user experience or worse, create challenges around security and data integrity, it might look to add further guardrails, or find other ways to deliver AI-powered content.\u201d A focus on privacy and security Apple has been vocal about how it intends to keep user data private and secure when using its own proprietary technology, noting most AI functions will be done on the phone and inputs will be kept away from a far-off server cloud. \u201cAs we look to build in these incredible new capabilities, we want to ensure that the outcome reflects the principles at the core of our products, it has to be powerful enough to help with the things that matter most to you,\u201d Cook said during the keynote. \u201cIt has to be intuitive and easy to use. It has to be deeply integrated into your product experiences.\u201d \u201cAnd, of course, it has to be built with privacy, from the ground up,\u201d he added. Apple said it will not share any personal user information with OpenAI, so inquiries made through ChatGPT won\u2019t be linked to an Apple user\u2019s account. And the repeated consent prompt to require users to opt into using ChatGPT with Siri is noteworthy too; each time Siri wants to kick over a question to ChatGPT, it\u2019ll ask for permission first. Wood believes the consent prompts and other guardrails that Apple is implementing \u201creflect its nervousness.\u201d Meanwhile, Reece Hayden, a principal analyst at ABI Research, told CNN that Apple\u2019s approach is smart because it provides customers with a choice of how to deal with their data. \u201cBy providing a phased approach that blends ChatGPT and native capabilities, users will worry less about the partnership,\u201d he said. \u201cApple can also continue to highlight their own AI capabilities and mitigate some of the risks of being associated with OpenAI, which remains in a state of flux.\u201d Industry concerns Companies like OpenAI have acknowledged the serious risks posed by AI \u2014 from manipulation to a loss of control that could potentially result in human extinction \u2014 but many experts, researchers and AI employees believe they should be doing more to educate the public about risks and protective measures. Just last week, a group of OpenAI insiders demanded that artificial intelligence companies be far more transparent about the concerns over the technology they\u2019re building. So it came as no surprise when some industry watchers, including Elon Musk, were quick to react to Apple\u2019s partnership with OpenAI. In a post to X Monday, Musk said he would ban Apple devices at his companies \u2014 which include Tesla, SpaceX and X, among others \u2014 if the iPhone maker went ahead with its AI plans. If Apple \u201cintegrates OpenAI at the (operating system) level,\u201d Musk said that would constitute \u201can unacceptable security violation.\u201d Although concerns over how employees are using AI models is a topic of worldwide discussion at the moment across many industries, Gartner analyst Annette Zimmermann said Musk\u2019s reaction is a bit misdirected and the topic is not specific to iPhones. \u201cAny employee with a smartphone should follow company policies and not enter any private information into the open domain of ChatGPT,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is not specific to the iPhone \u2026 or Tesla.\u201d Andrew Cornwall, senior analyst at Forrester, told CNN he thinks it\u2019s unlikely that Apple users will become loyal to ChatGPT, as many people won\u2019t use the service unless the iPhone maker can\u2019t provide an appropriate response. \u201cWhen users do query ChatGPT, Apple will track the prompts and gather metrics to improve its own models,\u201d he said. \u201cApple may switch providers or even use more than one third party \u2014 until it has mastered its own model. At that point, Apple will shut the garden gate.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/tech/apple-openai-partnership/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_tech_apples-ai-tools-preview", "text": "Apple is about to throw artificial intelligence into the mainstream, but some of it is similar to what its competitors are already doing. In a demo following Tuesday\u2019s annual Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple gave CNN a preview of some of the AI-powered features coming to the iPhone, iPad and Mac in the fall. Powered by what the company is calling \u201cApple Intelligence,\u201d some of the tools highlight a new era for the company; others remind us they\u2019re just playing catch up. Still, for many, this will be the first time interacting with generative AI \u2013 the buzzy form of artificial intelligence that can provide seemingly thorough responses to questions \u2013\u00a0in a way that will affect their everyday lives. The biggest change coming to Apple devices is a modernized, much smarter Siri, potentially turning the company\u2019s virtual assistant with a hit-or-miss track record into a more reliable, personalized chatbot. On the other hand, however, other AI tools look familiar from what we\u2019ve seen on the market. And the very first iteration of Siri, launched in 2011, came with similar prognostications, only to fall relatively flat in the cultural zeitgeist. Apple Intelligence, for example, will help spot typos or grammar mistakes in emails, similar to a spellchecker or services like Grammarly, or turn a casual draft into one with a more professional tone (much like Microsoft\u2019s AI software Copilot). It\u2019ll also offer the ability to circle and remove distractions in photos (akin to Google Pixel\u2019s Magic Easer). And it can also enable the production of AI-generated images from sketches (similar to Samsung Image Wand). Apple is often not the first to adopt and integrate emerging technologies. The company typically researches, develops and aims to perfect new tech for years before including it in new products. Yet the speed at which the world is adopting generative AI perhaps expedited the company\u2019s need to have a smartphone with the latest tech industry bet and finally show off what it\u2019s likely been working on behind the scenes for years. Catering to pro users Users of only Apple most\u2019s powerful (and therefore expensive) devices will be able to use the AI tools \u2013 this includes the iPhone 15 Pro or Mac with a M1, M2 and M3 processor. The rollout could also entice consumers to upgrade their devices at a time when they\u2019ve been holding onto older models longer. Ahead of the demo, the company emphasized that the majority of the new tools are powered by Apple Intelligence. Its partnership with ChatGPT creator OpenAI only comes into play in a limited, specific way (more on that soon). In the demo, Apple discussed how writing tools with AI can be used to tighten cover letters and suggest changes, or change the tone of an email, rework sentence structure or catch typos. If you want your email to sound more professional, or more friendly, Apple says its AI will take a stab. While using the Notes app, you could ask for a summary of a meeting or school lecture. In the Photos app, it\u2019s possible to remove something or someone out of a picture you no longer want there, using a quick tap. Apple also walked us through creating customized photos that could be sent in messages, such as the Golden Gate Bridge with fireworks in the background, or creating a birthday party invitation with a custom picture of a dinosaur on a surfboard. It\u2019s easy to see how this, along with Genmoji \u2013 Apple\u2019s custom AI-generated emoji that uses your likeness against different backgrounds \u2013 will bring new methods of communication into texting and interacting with others. Siri\u2019s AI flex Apple really flexes its AI muscle, however, when it comes to Siri, which Apple says is taking a massive step forward by becoming more contextually relevant and more personal. In the demo, an Apple executive asked Siri to set an alarm for 5:30 am and then changed her mind to 5:45 am. Siri obliged without a fumble. In Messages, Siri will know what you\u2019re discussing in case a question comes up. For example, if you\u2019re chatting with someone about tennis player Roger Federer, you can ask Siri how many games he\u2019s won without ever saying his name out loud. When you have a question that\u2019s beyond Siri\u2019s scope, ChatGPT can step in. In the demo, Apple showed how someone could upload a picture of vegetables at a farmer\u2019s market and ask what they could make for dinner. Siri could offer that this is a question better suited for ChatGPT, and ask the user if they consent to using the service. Although the partnership is limited for now, some analysts say it makes sense for the company to grow its own proprietary technology and fill in the gaps with ChatGPT in the meantime. Apple could either scale back or grow its partnership with OpenAI over time, but using it in a limited capability could potentially cut down on risks associated with the company. OpenAI, along with other AI companies, continue to face concerns around misinformation, biases, copyright, privacy and security, and more. It also comes at a time when the\u00a0industry is moving so quickly and government regulators, companies and consumers are still figuring out how to use the technology responsibly. During its presentation, Apple also emphasized privacy and security, noting most AI functions will be done on the phone, keeping inputs away from a far-off server cloud. While the market didn\u2019t seem to respond immediately to Apple\u2019s announcements on Monday, with its stock price (AAPL) dipping slightly, the company\u2019s stock rose more than 7% on Tuesday. Although these are only Apple\u2019s first steps into what tech giants are desperately hoping is a brave new world, it\u2019s now poised to be a player in the ever-growing AI arms race.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/tech/apples-ai-tools-preview/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "business"}}

Discovery, CNN\u2019s parent company, announced Tuesday a 10-year deal to become the new US home for the French Open tennis tournament beginning in 2025, a move that underscores how live sports remain a draw for cable networks in the age of cord-cutting. Under the \u201cnew expansive deal,\u201d all roughly 900 matches will air live on the streaming platform Max, with featured matches on TNT and TBS and a new whip-around show on truTV. Bleacher Report and House of Highlights will become digital hubs for the prestigious two-week tournament, which begins yearly in late May. Variety first reported the deal on Friday. \u201cRoland-Garros perfectly aligns with our global sports strategy and our commitment to adding premium live sports content to our TNT Sports portfolio,\u201d said Luis Silberwasser, Chairman and CEO, TNT Sports, in a release. Financial terms weren\u2019t publicly disclosed, but a source familiar with the deal confirmed to CNN that it\u2019s worth $650 million. The Athletic was first to report the cost of the deal. WBD already has an existing relationship with Roland-Garros since it began broadcasting the tennis tournament across Europe on Eurosport since 1989. The agreement makes WBD the \u201clargest global broadcast partner\u201d for Roland-Garros. NBC has largely aired the French Open since 1983, although its limited coverage of matches has angered loyal viewers. The Tennis Channel stepped in to air more matches in 2006, splitting the rights with NBC.

{"id": "2024_03_27_media_nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over", "text": "Only 80 hours elapsed between NBC News announcing Ronna McDaniel as a paid contributor and the network ousting her from that very role. But for the leadership at NBC Universal News Group, those were 80\u00a0painful hours. On Tuesday evening, following another full day in which the media rumor mill churned at warp speed, NBCU News Group boss Cesar Conde sent staff a memo, notifying his troops that he had reversed his decision to welcome the former Republican National Committee chair to \u201cthe team.\u201d \u201cAfter listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor,\u201d Conde said, adding that he wanted to \u201cpersonally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down.\u201d Conde had no real choice. The embattled NBCU boss, who I\u2019m told dealt with the crisis from an unknown location outside of 30 Rock, was facing an unprecedented rebellion from his most high-profile stars, who one by one went on the air and excoriated leadership\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel. The only aspect of Conde\u2019s note that was surprising was the fact that it came 48 hours late, allowing what started off as a crisis to fester and balloon into one of the worst corporate public relations calamities in recent memory. \u201cWhat a sh*t show!\u201d a media executive exclaimed to me Tuesday shortly after Conde relieved McDaniel of her NBC News credentials. In his note, Conde said he took \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for McDaniel\u2019s hire. But, he also did point the finger, telling staffers that hiring her was \u201ca collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team.\u201d Indeed, multiple people familiar with the matter have told me that the infighting among NBC executives over who was at fault for the disaster has reached a fever pitch, with various factions of the NBCU News Group assigning blame to others. Regardless of who is to blame, the entire affair made clear who is actually in control of the company \u2014 and it\u2019s not Conde & Co. Despite the NBCU C-suite digging their heels in the sand as they resisted dumping McDaniel for days, they were ultimately forced to succumb to pressure from their talent. As a second media executive commented to me, it is now \u201cvery clear who is in charge\u201d after the \u201cweak leadership was put on full display.\u201d \u201cHas Cesar lost the room?\u201d wondered a third media executive. While the Peacock family argues over who was really at fault, the company is facing a fresh public relations mess. Led by Donald Trump, right-wing personalities are already assailing the network as being overrun with intolerant woke leftists. \u201cThese Radical Left Lunatics are CRAZY and the top people at NBC ARE WEAK,\u201d Trump raged on his Truth Social platform. Ari Fleischer, who served as press secretary under President George W. Bush, wrote on X: \u201cWhat NBC is saying is if you\u2019re for Trump, you don\u2019t belong. Good. Let NBC be for Democrats only.\u201d Of course, that narrative is intellectually dishonest. The objection to McDaniel from both within and outside of NBCU was not that she is a Republican. It wasn\u2019t even that she was a Trump-supporting Republican. No, the objection stemmed from the fact that McDaniel was an active participant in the plot to subvert the 2020 vote. And, in addition to that disgraceful history, she had a lengthy track record smearing NBC News and MSNBC. Nevertheless, NBCU will now have to contend with such dishonest attacks being leveled by the right, which will follow them in the days, months, and even years to come. As unfair as it may be, they will certainly damage the network\u2019s brand in Republican circles \u2014 a place it had gone through great pains to appeal to. NBCU will also have to grapple with McDaniel, who spent the last 24 hours or so interviewing lawyers as she gears up for a possible legal fight with the network, according to a person familiar with the matter. The rift between McDaniel and NBCU had grown to such an extent by Tuesday that she was not informed by network brass that she had been dismissed, I\u2019m told. Instead, McDaniel learned of her ouster in press reports. While NBCU is being beaten up on the right, the company\u2019s leadership was quickly praised by its journalists and top stars. Shortly after Conde sent out his memo, Rachel Maddow appeared on Joy Reid\u2019s show, where the two lauded Conde for reversing course. \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/27/media/nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_business_house-prices-impossibly-unaffordable-intl-hnk", "text": "Anyone with half an eye on the housing market over the last two decades will know that in many countries, not least the United States, it\u2019s become much more difficult to buy a home. But a new report sums up the feeling of many potential home buyers by creating a category that labels some major cities as \u201cimpossibly unaffordable.\u201d The report compared average incomes with average home prices. It found that pandemic-driven demand for homes with outside space, land use policies aimed at limiting urban sprawl, and investors piling into markets had sent prices soaring. US cities on the West Coast and Hawaii occupied five of the top 10 most unaffordable places, according to the annual Demographic International Housing Affordability report, which has been tracking house prices for 20 years. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the most expensive US cities to buy home are in California, where San Jose, Los Angeles, San Francisco and San Diego have all made the top 10. The Hawaiian capital of Honolulu also rates a mention in sixth place of 94 major markets surveyed in eight countries. Australia is the only other country besides the US to dominate the \u201cimpossibly unaffordable\u201d list, led by Sydney and\u00a0the southern cities of Melbourne in Victoria and Adelaide in South Australia. But topping the global leaderboard is Hong Kong, the compact Asian financial hub known for its tiny apartments and sky-high rents. Notably, it\u2019s the only Chinese market covered in the report. A regular entrant on the \u201cmost expensive\u201d tables, Hong Kong has the lowest home ownership rate of all the cities surveyed, at just 51%, compared to its Asian rival Singapore where home ownership tops 89% due to the government\u2019s decades-long commitment to public housing. Hong Kong may be the least affordable city worldwide, but potential home buyers may be encouraged to know that it\u2019s not as unaffordable as it once was. House prices slipped during the pandemic in 2020, when the government closed the city\u2019s borders and imposed a zero-Covid policy \u2014 that\u2019s on top of new national security laws that have had a chilling effect on the city. Why so high? The report measures affordability using a price-to-income ratio of the median house price divided by the gross median household income. It links the rise in working from home during the pandemic to a \u201cdemand shock\u201d for houses outside city centers, which have more outside space. But it also blames soaring house prices on land use policies, including \u201curban containment,\u201d a kind of planning designed to stop urban sprawl. \u201cThe middle-class is under siege principally due to the escalation of land costs. As land has been rationed in an effort to curb urban sprawl, the excess of demand over supply has driven prices up,\u201d the report said. Prices were driven up even further as investors jumped into the market to make a profit. One solution, the report\u2019s author wrote, is to look to New Zealand. In an opinion piece for Canada\u2019s Financial Post, Wendell Cox, a senior fellow at the Frontier Centre for Public Policy, advocated for Canada, in particular, to follow New Zealand\u2019s lead and free up more land for immediate development. Both Vancouver and Toronto made the list of the cities that are \u201cimpossibly unaffordable.\u201d Cox points to a policy, \u201cGoing for Housing Growth,\u201d introduced by New Zealand\u2019s coalition government that requires local authorities to immediately zone for 30 years of housing growth. \u201cToronto and Vancouver show that the cost of taming expansion is unacceptably high: inflated house prices, higher rents and, for increasing numbers of people, poverty,\u201d Cox wrote. For those who can\u2019t wait for a change in policy or for demand to fall, the report also identifies the most affordable cities of the 94 surveyed worldwide. They are Pittsburgh, Rochester and St Louis in the US; Edmonton and Calgary in Canada; Blackpool, Lancashire and Glasgow in the United Kingdom; and Perth and Brisbane in Australia. The report was compiled by researchers from the Center for Demographics and Policy at Chapman University in California and the Frontier Centre for Public Policy, an independent public policy think tank in Canada.

{"id": "2024_06_11_tech_elon-musk-drops-openai-lawsuit", "text": "Lawyers for Elon Musk on Tuesday moved to dismiss the billionaire\u2019s lawsuit against OpenAI and CEO Sam Altman, ending a months-long legal battle between co-founders of the artificial intelligence startup. Musk \u2014 who co-founded OpenAI in 2015 \u2014 sued the company in February, accusing the ChatGPT maker of abandoning its original, nonprofit mission by reserving some of its most advanced AI technology for private customers. The lawsuit had sought a jury trial and for the company, Altman and co-founder and president Greg Brockman to pay back any profit they received from the business. But OpenAI quickly pushed back against Musk\u2019s claims, calling them \u201cincoherent\u201d and \u201cfrivolous\u201d and arguing in a court filing that the case should be dismissed. The company also published a blog post that included several of Musk\u2019s emails from OpenAI\u2019s early days. The emails appeared to show Musk acknowledging the need for the company to make large sums of money to fund the computing resources needed to power its AI ambitions, which stood in contrast to the claims in his lawsuit that OpenAI was wrongly pursuing profit. Musk\u2019s lawyers did not cite a reason for their request to drop the lawsuit in Tuesday\u2019s filing. A hearing regarding OpenAI\u2019s motion to dismiss the case had been scheduled for Wednesday. The move to drop the lawsuit also came one day after Musk fired off a string of posts on his social media platform X criticizing OpenAI and its handling of user data, after Apple announced a partnership that integrates ChatGPT with digital personal assistant Siri for users on an opt-in basis. \u201cIf Apple integrates OpenAI at the OS\ufeff (operating system) level, then Apple devices will be banned at my companies. That is an unacceptable security violation,\u201d Musk said in one post. (Apple said as part of its announcement that user queries sent to ChatGPT will not be stored by OpenAI.) The Musk-OpenAI legal battle represented the diverging visions for how the ChatGPT maker \u2014 which has quickly skyrocketed in value and become the leader in the burgeoning AI space that many see as the future of technology \u2014 should be managed. Musk accused OpenAI of racing to develop powerful \u201cartificial general intelligence\u201d technology to \u201cmaximize profits.\u201d OpenAI, meanwhile, accused Musk of essentially being jealous that he was no longer involved in the startup, after he left OpenAI in 2018 following an unsuccessful bid to convince his fellow co-founders to let Tesla acquire it. But while OpenAI called Musk\u2019s claims \u201ca fiction,\u201d the billionaire is not the only person who has raised questions about OpenAI\u2019s leadership and direction. The company last year faced a high-profile leadership crisis that led to Altman\u2019s temporary ouster from the company, apparently over concerns by several board members about the\u00a0risks of artificial intelligence. After days of uncertainty and an intervention by Microsoft, a major investor in OpenAI, Altman was restored to his position in what industry analysts said was a victory for those seeking to commercialize AI technology. More recently, multiple high-profile OpenAI safety leaders exited the company, with several publicly claiming the company had prioritized quickly rolling out new products over safety. Weeks later, the company said it had established a new committee that would make recommendations to the company\u2019s board about safety and security.

{"id": "2024_03_15_success_best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund", "text": "The average federal tax refund is more than $3,000, according to the latest data from the IRS. Since the majority of tax filers get a refund, there\u2019s a fair chance you could get hundreds if not thousands of dollars back in overpaid taxes, especially if you\u2019re also owed a refund from your state government. That money may feel like a windfall, and it\u2019s easy to squander it on a lot of little things. But if you\u2019re looking to improve your current financial situation, here are seven ideas to consider. Well, technically six, but you\u2019ll enjoy the seventh the most. 1. Pay off high-rate debt If you are carrying a balance on your credit card and are paying 20% to 30% in interest, make this your first priority to pay down. At such sky-high rates, \u201cthe debt can grow faster than you can pay it off,\u201d said Eric Bronnenkant, a certified financial planner and head of tax at Betterment, a robo-advisory financial services firm that also has a human advice team on hand to help clients. Keyana Russ, a certified financial planner at Four Ponds Financial Planning, concurred that people\u2019s awareness of how much money they\u2019re paying in interest over time doesn\u2019t always register. \u201cWhat I usually see is people paying the minimum, or they\u2019re charging everyday expenses and not paying off the bill at the end of the month. \u2026 They don\u2019t understand how much interest they\u2019re paying,\u201d Russ said. For example, if you\u2019re carrying a $3,000 balance at 27% interest and you only pay a required minimum of $97.50 every month, it will take you 240 months (which is 20 years) just to pay off the $3,000 \u2014 and, in addition, you will have paid $3,044.57 in interest, for a total of $6,044.57, according to Bankrate.com\u2019s calculator. 2. Create or add to an emergency fund You can use your refund to start or bolster an emergency fund. When it comes to costly emergencies, there are many Americans who don\u2019t have at least three months\u2019 worth of living expenses set aside, let alone enough to easily handle an unexpected bill of $1,000. Be sure to stash the money in a high-yield savings account at an FDIC-insured bank, Russ suggested, noting that the best interest rates are typically offered by online banks. If you have high-rate debt and you\u2019re lacking emergency savings, Russ suggested you might use a portion of your refund to attack your debt and the other portion to create an emergency fund. Bronnenkant favors paying off the high-rate debt first, but, if you\u2019re low on emergency savings and need a critical repair to help keep your job \u2014 such as on your car \u2014 he said it might make sense to set aside money for that repair and put the rest toward your credit card or other high-rate debt. 3. Make an extra payment on your mortgage If you\u2019re carrying a mortgage at a high rate (e.g., 7% to 8%), and you\u2019re not saddled with credit card debt, you might consider making an extra payment or two. \u201cIt can make a difference in the long run towards your principal,\u201d Russ said.\u00a0 You can even view it as an additional form of savings, in the sense that you\u2019re saving yourself an extra 7% \ufeffor so in interest on the portion of the principal you\u2019re paying down, Bronnenkant noted. 4. Invest in a Roth IRA If your income qualifies you to contribute to a Roth IRA, you can contribute up to $7,000 this year ($8,000 if you\u2019re at least 50) with after-tax savings. That money will grow untaxed until retirement, at which point your withdrawals will be tax-free and penalty-free after age 59-1/2, assuming the account has been open for at least five years. (And note: You can still make a 2023 Roth contribution until April 15 this year. The contribution limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if you\u2019re age 50 or older. Bolstering your tax-free retirement savings is great.\u00a0But if you need to access some of your money well before you retire, you may take out any part of your contributions tax-free and penalty-free at any time, \ufeffBronnenkant said. You would only be taxed and penalized if you withdrew the earnings on your contributions before age 59-1/2. (For more information on Roth IRA withdrawal rules, here is an easy-to-understand rundown from Charles Schwab.) 5. Contribute enough to your 401(k) in 2024 to get your full employer match Speaking of retirement savings, if you\u2019re not yet contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match from your employer, a refund can make that easier. Say you get $3,000 back. You can put that money in a high-yield savings account to earn interest. Then, on your workplace 401(k) site, change your paycheck contribution levels so that by the end of the year you will have contributed $3,000 more in pre-tax money than you otherwise would have. For instance, say you\u2019re paid every two weeks and you have 20 more paychecks left until the end of the year. You can boost you biweekly contributions by $150 per paycheck ($150 x 20 = $3,000). \u201cYou want to get the max match from your employer,\u201d Bronnenkant said. 6. Invest for shorter-term goals If in the next three to 10 years you expect to buy a home, take a once-in-a-lifetime trip, renovate a room, send your kids to summer camp or have any other expensive goal, you might consider investing your refund in a diversified mix of low-cost, broad market index funds. The shorter term your goal is, the less risk you want to take. If you need the money within three years, you might consider putting your refund in certificates of deposits and US Treasury bonds. But if your goal is five to 10 years out, and you\u2019re comfortable taking on some more risk and are willing to accept fluctuations in the market, Bronnenkant said, you might put no more than 30% of your refund in a stock index fund and 70% in a total market bond fund if your risk tolerance is conservative; or 50% in each if you have a moderate risk tolerance. If you plan on sending your child to college and you have a 529 plan, you can use your refund to boost your contributions to that plan, Russ said. You may also get a tax break for your contribution depending on the state where you live. 7. Have some fun Unless you\u2019re in truly dire financial straits, if you get a large refund, you might set aside a small portion to do whatever you truly enjoy. \u201cSometimes you just want to have fun and not have it be all business,\u201d Russ said. \u201cYou can set aside some of the money to have fun.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/15/success/best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_investing_france-financial-crisis-elections", "text": "Investors are worried France could be facing a financial crisis if the political center collapses in upcoming parliamentary elections, leaving far-right populists in charge of the European Union\u2019s second-biggest economy. President Emmanuel Macron called the snap elections Sunday after his party lost to the\u00a0far right in a vote for EU lawmakers, a shock move that rattled markets for French stocks and government bonds. There has been widespread speculation since then that the National Rally,\u00a0the party of far-right doyenne Marine Le Pen, is poised to become the most powerful force in parliament, unseating Macron\u2019s centrist bloc. Such an outcome could make it harder to reduce France\u2019s huge government debt pile, equal to 110.6% of gross domestic product at the end of last year, and could even add to it. A bitterly divided parliament would also struggle to cut the budget deficit \u2014 the gap between government spending and tax receipts \u2014 which reached 5.5%\u00a0of GDP last year. \u201cIf Le Pen calls the shots in parliament and pursues major parts of her expensive fiscal and protectionist \u2018France first\u2019 agenda, the result could be a Liz Truss-style financial crisis,\u201d Berenberg economists wrote in a note Friday, adding that, for now, this was \u201ca\u00a0serious risk, not a forecast.\u201d The British pound and UK government bonds sold off sharply in September 2022 after former Prime Minister Truss unveiled plans to increase borrowing to pay for tax cuts. Mortgage rates soared as investors demanded much higher premiums for owning UK debt. Truss resigned soon after, becoming the shortest-serving prime minister in British history. The risk of something similar happening in France is real, according to the country\u2019s finance minister, Bruno Le Maire. Asked Friday on franceinfo, a French radio station, whether the political turmoil triggered by Macron\u2019s\u00a0decision to call the snap elections could lead to a financial crisis,\u00a0Le Maire\u00a0replied \u201cyes.\u201d He noted that France now has to pay a higher interest rate than Portugal \u2014 one of the countries bailed out during the European debt crisis more than a decade ago \u2014 to borrow from investors. \u201cThis comes down to the (parties\u2019) plans that are on the table, whether we can, yes or no, finance this debt,\u201d Le Maire said. Credit ratings agencies are already keeping a close eye on France, one of the EU\u2019s three most-indebted countries. In May, S&P\u00a0downgraded\u00a0the country\u2019s long-term credit score to AA-, citing the \u201cdeterioration of (its) budgetary position,\u201d though it still thought France had ample capacity to repay its debts. The agency said it expected the budget deficit to narrow to 3.5% of GDP in 2027, well above the 2.9% targeted by the current government. Markets are already roiled by the prospect of political upheaval. The yield, or the interest rate sought by investors, on France\u2019s benchmark 10-year government bonds stood at 3.17% on Friday afternoon in Europe, compared with 3.15% for the Portuguese equivalent. In another sign of traders\u2019 jitters, the premium they demand to hold French government bonds instead of the ultra-safe AAA-rated German equivalents rose Thursday to its highest level since 2017. The spread was widening even further Friday. Stock markets haven\u2019t escaped. On Friday, France\u2019s benchmark of 40 leading stocks fell much more than similar German and pan-European indexes. The euro has sagged this week too. An Elabe opinion poll for CNN affiliate BFMTV and La Tribune Dimanche showed Wednesday that Macron\u2019s centrist bloc was on track to come only third in the first round of the elections on June 30, far behind the National Rally and an alliance of left-wing parties. The National Rally has promised to raise public spending and slash VAT on electricity and fuel. Le Maire said Friday that markets\u2019 response to such measures would be: \u201cI\u2019m sorry but you don\u2019t have the means to afford these expenses.\u201d Likewise, speaking on a webinar Thursday, Frank Gill, a senior specialist in European sovereign ratings at S&P Global Ratings, said the policies advocated by the National Rally \u201ccould further drag on public finances\u201d and \u201cwould be a consideration for the sovereign rating.\u201d And Moody\u2019s said in a note Monday that the snap elections increased the risks to fiscal consolidation in France, \u201ca credit negative.\u201d The European Central Bank \u201cwould have the means to prevent any genuine crisis\u201d in the French government bond market, a Berenberg note said earlier this week. But \u201cakin to the sequence of events in the erstwhile euro crisis, the ECB may only deploy its instruments \u2014\u00a0or announce that it could do so\u00a0\u2014\u00a0if and when the country in question has returned to sounder fiscal policies.\u201d Joseph Ataman in Paris and Mark Thompson in London contributed reporting.

{"id": "2024_03_20_success_interest-rates-savings-cash", "text": "The Federal Reserve\u2019s benchmark interest rate remains at a 23-year high. That\u2019s thanks to the central bank\u2019s decision Wednesday to once again hold it steady, as it has done at the policy-making committee\u2019s past five meetings. That decision may be disappointing to some investors, homebuyers and those with a lot of credit card debt, since movement in the Fed\u2019s overnight lending rate influences rates \u2014 directly or indirectly \u2014 on consumer financial products (e.g., credit cards, bank loans and mortgages). But\u00a0with the Fed signaling that no rate cuts are likely until summer, it also means anyone with savings still has at least a few more months to make hay of their stash. That\u2019s because you can still get inflation-beating interest rates that will grow any money you have set aside for emergencies, vacations, down payments or any other goal in your sights over the next several years. However, that won\u2019t happen if you just let it sit in a traditional checking or savings account that yields next to nothing. There are more lucrative, low-risk options out there, with rates that are still at or near their peaks. \u201cBut perhaps not for much longer,\u201d said Ted Rossman, senior analyst at Bankrate. \u201cIf one of those fits into your financial plans, it\u2019s best to act soon.\u201d So, consider the following options when deciding where to park your hard-earned savings. High-yield online savings accounts The average annual percentage yield on bank savings accounts was just 0.52% as of March 13, according to Bankrate. That average is kept low by the biggest brick-and-mortar banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, which still are offering a paltry 0.01%. By contrast, there are still FDIC-insured online banks offering inflation-beating rates of between 4.35% and 5.35% on their high-yield savings accounts. Generally speaking, these are the best vehicles in which to keep your emergency funds for quick, easy access. Choosing between an account that pays 0.52% and one that pays 5.35% can mean forfeiting hundreds of dollars in interest. \u201cIf you put $10,000 in a savings account, that\u2019s a difference of $496 in interest earnings over the course of the year, assuming monthly compounding,\u201d Rossman said. While the rates on high-yield savings accounts have gone down a bit in recent months, \u201cwidespread cuts in online savings account rates are unlikely until the first Fed rate cut is near,\u201d said Ken Tumin, founder of DepositAccounts.com. As with any bank savings rate, high-yield savings account\u00a0rates\u00a0can change overnight, and the bank may not alert you when it lowers it. So make sure to check your monthly statement. Certificates of deposits Another high-return, low-risk investment that is great for money you likely won\u2019t need to tap for a few months or even a couple of years is a certificate of deposit. You can get the best returns on CDs through a brokerage such as Schwab, E*Trade or Fidelity. That\u2019s because you can comparison shop for CDs from any number of FDIC-insured banks and will not have to set up individual accounts with each institution. As of March 13, the average rate on a one-year CD was 1.95%, but some banks are offering as much are 5.4%. If you can get a one-year CD at, say, 5.4%, you will make $540 on a $10,000 investment. To get the greatest benefit from a CD, you have to leave the money invested for a fixed period. You can always access your principal sooner if you need to, but there may be early withdrawal penalties. As of March 20, CDs listed on Schwab.com with durations from three months up to three years were all yielding between 5.2% and 5.51%. CD rates on durations between four and 10 years ranged from 4.40% to 5.15%. Say you invest $10,000 in a one-year CD with a 5.36%\u00a0APY. At the end of that period, you\u2019d get your principal back plus $536 in interest when the CD matures, according to Bankrate\u2019s CD calculator. If you chose a two-year CD at 5.25%, you\u2019d bank an extra $1,078, assuming compounding interest. The same investment in a five-year CD at 5.15% would earn $2,854. \u201cIt makes sense to go long with CDs. To hedge your bets, include terms from one to five years. Starting a CD ladder will provide this mix,\u201d Tumin said. If you don\u2019t go through a brokerage you may get a reasonable deal from your primary bank, Tumin said. For example, he noted, Wells Fargo is still offering up to 5.01% on both 4-month and 7-month CDs. Or, at Bank of America, you can get up to 4.75% on a 7-month CD. But Tumin cautions that with any big bank CD you should take your money out at the end of the term, otherwise your bank may automatically renew it and lock you in to a much lower-yielding CD. Money market accounts and funds If you don\u2019t want to set up an online savings account at another bank, your own bank may offer you a money market deposit account that pays a higher yield than your regular checking or savings accounts. Money market accounts may have higher minimum deposit requirements than a regular savings account, but they are more liquid than a fixed-term certificate of deposit or Treasury bill, meaning they give you access to your money more quickly while still potentially giving you some of the highest yields available, said Doug Ornstein, senior manager for integrated solutions at TIAA Wealth Management. But don\u2019t confuse money market accounts with money market mutual funds, which invest in short-term, low-risk debt instruments. As of March 19, they had an average 7-day yield of 5.14%, according to the Crane Money Fund Index, which tracks the top 100 taxable money market funds. Unlike money market deposit accounts, money market mutual funds are not insured by the FDIC. But if you invest in a money market fund through a brokerage, your overall account is likely to be insured through the Securities Investor Protection Corp, which offers protection in the event your brokerage ever goes under. Treasury bills and notes Another option for money you can leave untouched anywhere from several months to a few years is to buy short-term Treasury bills and medium-term notes, which are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. Three- and six-month bills had yields of 5.39% and 5.33%\u00a0respectively on March 20 before the Fed\u2019s meeting ended, while nine-month and one-year bills were offering 5.19% and 5.08%\u00a0respectively, according to rates posted on Schwab.com for a $25,000 investment. Rates on Treasury notes with durations from two years to 10 years ranged between 4.29% and 4.72%. If you\u2019re someone who manages your portfolio like a hawk, you may feel comfortable buying T-bills on your own from TreasuryDirect.gov. But if you don\u2019t, it might be easier just to buy new issues through your brokerage account or invest in a short-term bond index fund or ETF, said Andy Smith, executive director of financial planning at Edelman Financial Engines. And if you\u2019re looking at money that will be needed in three to five years, you might consider a diversified fund of highly rated government and corporate bonds, Ornstein said. An 18-month AAA-rated corporate bond, for instance, was yielding 4.82% this week, while the three-year was at 4.49%. Meanwhile, three-year AAA-rated municipal bonds (which are issued by local governments) had a rate of 3.98%, according to Schwab.com. Don\u2019t chase yield When deciding on the best accounts and investments for your specific goals and peace of mind, it may pay to consult a fee-only fiduciary adviser \u2014 meaning, someone who doesn\u2019t get paid a commission to sell you a particular investment. What you\u2019ll always want to do is build in flexibility for yourself so you can easily access cash, regardless of your timeline for key goals. \u201cWhat happens if something changes and you need that down payment a lot sooner \u2014 or your parents need medical care fast?\u201d Smith said. That means balancing your desire for great yield with a need and desire for ease of access without penalty. Translation: Don\u2019t chase yield for yield\u2019s sake. Think of it this way, Ornstein said: Unless you have huge sums to invest or are an institutional investor, the difference between getting a 5.1% yield versus 5% is negligible, and in fact it could even cost you more if there are penalties for taking your money out early. \u201cMost of the time convenience is really important. Give up the 0.1%,\u201d he advised.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/20/success/interest-rates-savings-cash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "business"}}
