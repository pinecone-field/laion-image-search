{"id": "business_retailers-crackdown-organized-crime-invs", "text": "When SWAT officers swarmed a house in a sleepy San Jose, California neighborhood last month, they found what could best be described as a make-shift hardware store inside: Shelves lined with boxes of brand-new tools, bathroom fixtures and spools of industrial wiring. It resembled a mini Home Depot. And in some ways, it was. Much of the cache of products\u2014worth about $150,000\u2014had been stolen from real Home Depot stores.\u00a0The retail chain\u2019s internal security force spent months investigating the thefts, scanning security camera footage, tracking license plates and surveilling suspects. They connected dots of the criminal network allegedly responsible and shared their findings with the Santa Clara County Sheriff\u2019s Office, which executed search warrants and arrested the suspects. Increasingly, this is how it goes today for retailers trying to battle theft and fraud by organized crime rings. A CNN review of court records and interviews with more than two dozen retail and law enforcement officials shows that persistent problems with sophisticated organized crime networks have led many private-sector companies to not only assist law enforcement but to often deliver the bulk of the evidence that leads to criminal prosecutions. Anyone who has shopped at retail stores in recent years has encountered everyday products like laundry detergent, medication and beauty supplies locked up behind metal gates or plexiglass. Retailers say those in-store security measures are emblematic of the ongoing threat of organized retail crime, which typically involves groups of low-level thieves who steal items for middlemen who in turn sell to unsuspecting customers hunting for deals on marketplaces such as Amazon or eBay. Efforts to counter this crime, however, have come with some costs. Security investments can translate into higher prices for consumers, and civil liberties advocates argue the surveillance technology used by retailers can infringe on individuals\u2019 privacy. While retailers have long partnered with law enforcement, the industry has bolstered its role in recent years, devoting more staff and financial resources to thwarting theft. Some retailers are researching body-worn cameras for employees. Others, including Home Depot, have invested in police-like investigation centers to sift through data and pinpoint theft-group members. \u201cA lot of times, local and state resources don\u2019t have the capacity to investigate these crimes at that scale,\u201d said Sean Browne, senior manager of asset protection for Home Depot. Browne said Home Depot, which has nearly tripled its investigative team since 2016,  has started using license-plate readers in some store parking lots. \u201cWe try to full-service the investigations and ensure we cut off the head of the snake.\u201d Where law enforcement agencies sometimes face jurisdictional limits to their investigations, retailers can track cases across state and county lines with increasingly sophisticated tools \u2013 such as artificial intelligence that identifies patterns \u2013 and choose agencies with which to share cases. \u201cRetailers themselves are really taking the ball and running with it and then partnering with law enforcement at all levels,\u201d said David Johnston, vice president of asset protection for the National Retail Federation (NRF), a top lobbying group for the retail industry. NRF surveys of retailers\u00a0last year found that more than half reported budget increases to combat organized retail crime. Precise national data on organized retail crime is lacking. Last year, NRF even retracted a claim in one of its reports related to the scale of the crime, which led critics to charge that the industry had exaggerated the issue to achieve policy goals or justify store closures caused by underperformance. Still, most retailers insist they have seen an uptick in organized theft. About 90% of asset-protection professionals surveyed last year by NRF said the crime had become more of a risk over the prior three years. \u201cThese investments wouldn\u2019t be made for no reason,\u201d said Browne of Home Depot, which has also added security to stores like locks, gates, cameras and other tech to deter theft. \u201cUnfortunately, this creates an environment for our customers that isn\u2019t very friendly,\u201d he said. A complex crime The industry\u2019s push to crack down on organized retail crime comes amidst differing policies and law enforcement priorities across the nation. Some states have focused on tackling such theft, with more than a dozen launching organized retail crime taskforces, which collaborate with private companies and police. Investigators for the attorney general of Washington state, which created an organized retail crime unit last year, specifically credited businesses Target and Ulta Beauty for gathering much of the evidence\u00a0behind two felony cases, according to probable-cause affidavits. That material included loss prevention reports, security footage and photographs. In the case involving Ulta Beauty, a company investigator identified the defendant and accomplices who\u00a0allegedly stole products across six counties, according to an affidavit. \u201cWe can\u2019t bring the cases without them,\u201d Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson said when asked by CNN about the role of retailers. \u201cEverything you\u2019re seeing in those probable-cause statements is what you would see in case after case after case as we go forward with this work.\u201d Ferguson said organized retail crime cases are inherently complex to investigate and prosecute, especially for local agencies with limited resources, so public-private partnerships are a necessity. That was evident in the case of Linda Ann Been, an Oklahoma woman sentenced to more than five years in prison earlier this month for managing an organized theft ring that federal prosecutors say stole about $9 million in property from retailers. The case largely began with an investigator for CVS\u00a0who noticed a trend of thefts at his company\u2019s stores in the Tulsa area, according to a state affidavit. He then used records to link low-level thieves who physically robbed the stores with Been and shared his findings with a local detective. The investigation later revealed how Been had provided the thieves with lists of items to steal from businesses across multiple states. The items were organized at a warehouse and boutique clothing shop in a suburb of Tulsa and sold by Been to other sellers \u2013 known as \u201cfences\u201d \u2013 outside of Oklahoma who in turn sold the products through websites, including eBay and Amazon, to customers, documents show. In a brief interview with CNN prior to her sentencing, Been questioned why those higher-level fences to whom she sold products appear not to have faced consequences. \u201cHow come \u2026 nothing happened to those people?\u201d she asked. In her guilty plea in 2022, Been specifically named one such fence to whom she \u201cfrequently sent stolen inventory\u201d as a man named Baruch \u201cButch\u201d Treff. Treff, in an interview with CNN, acknowledged buying products from Been, whom he said other vendors had recommended, but insisted he had no idea she had traded in stolen goods. \u201cIf I knew I would never have bought from her. I don\u2019t deal with stolen goods,\u201d Treff said. An attorney for Treff, Yosef Jacobovitch, added that his client did due diligence and met with Been to try to ensure she was a legitimate vendor. \u201cShe fooled him and others,\u201d Jacobovitch said. A government investigator familiar with the case, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said one of the challenges of such cases is determining whether higher-level fences knowingly purchased stolen goods for resale. The case against Been\u2019s organization\u00a0involved a range of state and federal authorities including Homeland Security Investigations and the IRS, but during a news conference, a federal prosecutor credited retail-industry investigators for contributing and called such collaborations a \u201cforce multiplier.\u201d Aside from supplying evidence, retailers sometimes identify broader trends of groups moving from city to city before law enforcement, said Sgt. Patrick Flynn of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department\u2019s organized retail crime unit, which launched last year. Patrick Walsh, an organized-retail-crime manager for grocery chain Kroger, said his company has heavily invested not only in its investigative capacity but also visual deterrents. For example, the company purchased an old police car to drive around parking lots to ward off would-be criminals. Some companies\u2019 efforts have backfired. In December, drugstore chain Rite Aid agreed to a five-year ban on facial recognition technology after the Federal Trade Commission found\u00a0that the company\u2019s use of the tech led to false shoplifting allegations against customers \u2013 especially people of color\u00a0\u2013\u00a0who appeared to match entries in a company watchlist. A Rite Aid spokesperson said the company is enhancing its information-security practices and policies. The way retailers have collected evidence for police with such tech has alarmed privacy-rights advocates. \u201cPolice are public entities. You can send them a public records request. You can elect a mayor who may want to change the police department. You cannot do that with a giant corporation. You have very little control over what technology they deploy, how they deploy it and then what they do with that data,\u201d said Matthew Guariglia, a senior policy analyst with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group. Calls for more federal action The threat of organized retail crime and pressure from the industry has led some officials to call on the federal government to do more. Over the last year much of that push has centered on a federal bill, the Combating Organized Retail Crime Act, that would create an intelligence-sharing hub at the Department of Homeland Security and broaden the scope of applicable criminal conduct. San Diego County\u00a0District Attorney Summer Stephan, a Republican-turned-independent who expressed support for those changes at a congressional hearing in December, referred to limited coordination between law enforcement and retailers\u00a0and laws that apply relatively light penalties for habitual thieves as \u201ckey challenges\u201d in policing the issue. The bill has received\u00a0criticism. A coalition of civil rights groups that included the ACLU and NAACP argued in a letter in March that the legislation promotes punitive policies that would disproportionately affect marginalized communities and exacerbate poverty by pushing more crime into the federal system. \u201cThis enforcement-first response, we don\u2019t think that leads to crime deterrence,\u201d Chlo\u00e9 White, an attorney with one of those groups, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, told CNN. The bill has garnered support from a bipartisan group of lawmakers, but it has not advanced. \u201cEverything is stalled in Congress,\u201d said Rep. Dina Titus, a Nevada Democrat who helped introduce the legislation. Reacting to the way private retailers have been growing their internal investigative efforts, Titus said, \u201cThat\u2019s the reason we need to do something at the federal level\u2026 I\u2019m not trying to put down local law enforcement. I think they are doing the best they can with the resources they have.\u201d Congress has taken some steps to help the retail industry. A law that took effect last year requires online marketplaces to verify and disclose information on large, third-party sellers, such as bank account numbers. The law in effect makes it harder to sell stolen products through the internet with impunity. But industry sources argue online platforms could do more to police organized retail crime on their sites. Specifically, those marketplaces should more proactively question high-volume sellers of discounted goods and \u201cask for proof that these goods have been acquired lawfully,\u201d said Khris Hamlin, vice president of asset protection for the Retail Industry Leaders Association. Major online marketplaces say they have taken steps to combat such crime. Amazon touts a program that applies unique codes to certain products that can be used to detect and track stolen items. Mike Carson, eBay\u2019s senior director of global policy, said eBay has safeguards including automated processes that flag irregularities among items for sale, which can prompt further investigation. Browne of Home Depot said he welcomes more assistance from online marketplaces and the federal government. \u201cCrimes like drugs, human trafficking, they have major organizations going after this and rightfully so. Retail crimes have not gotten that same attention over the years,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s expanded beyond the bandwidth of local and sometimes even state law enforcement.\u201d CNN\u2019s Nelli Black and Yahya Abou-Ghazala contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/business/retailers-crackdown-organized-crime-invs/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "business"}}

Major business leaders and economists are worried about America\u2019s growing debt problem. Last week, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon expressed fear that a crisis is looming and that unchecked deficit spending could explode. \u201cAny country can borrow money and drive some growth, but that may not always lead to good growth,\u201d he said in an interview with Sky News. \u201cI think America should be quite aware that we have got to focus on our fiscal deficit issues a little bit more, and that is important for the world.\u201d Dimon went on to say that the deficit is \u201cwhy we have higher inflation\u201d and that he hopes that the US government \u201creally focuses\u201d on reducing the deficit. \u201cAt one point it will cause a problem, and why should you wait?\u201d he said. That problem \u201cwill be caused by the market, and then you will be forced to deal with it and probably in a far more uncomfortable way than if you dealt with it to start.\u201d What\u2019s happening: Bridgewater hedge fund founder Ray Dalio also told the Financial Times last week that investors should be \u201cworried about the US debt picture.\u201d Economist and former dean of Columbia Business School Glenn Hubbard told Before the Bell last week that interest \u201cpayments on the national debt, which were essentially zero a couple of years ago, are now as big as defense spending.\u201d The next president, he said, will have to deal with this issue. \u201cHe may not be campaigning on it, but whoever he is, he\u2019s going to have to do something about it,\u201d he said. So why the sudden confluence of concern? The big picture: Between the Trump-era tax cuts and Covid-era stimulus programs, the national debt has exploded in recent years. Spending via President Joe Biden\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act has continued to add to the debt. The United States government is spending a lot more than it\u2019s bringing in \u2014 it has run a budget deficit for six of the first seven months of this fiscal year. So far this fiscal year, the deficit has accumulated to about $855 billion \u2013 more than 6% of US gross domestic product (a measurement of the economy). That adds to the $34.6 trillion cumulative debt load the US has on its shoulders. The problem isn\u2019t just the large debt and deficit, it\u2019s that the US is running a deficit that\u2019s equivalent to nearly 7% of GDP while the economy is at full employment and is performing at its full potential, Jason Thomas, head of global research & investment strategy at Carlyle, told CNN.  What that implies is that if the US hits a recession \u2014 requiring the government to boost spending on stimulus programs even as tax receipts decline \u2014 \u201cyou\u2019re likely looking at a deficit that could be nine or 10% of GDP,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cThis is absolutely unsustainable.\u201d Why it matters: As deficits grow, the federal government has to issue more Treasury securities. That means they have to increase yields to attract more investors. That also raises borrowing costs across financial markets, hurting economic growth. Last month, the IMF said the high and rising level of US government debt risked driving up borrowing costs around the world and undermining global financial stability, reports my colleague Hanna Ziady. That warning followed an even blunter message from the head of the Congressional Budget Office, the US Congress\u2019s independent fiscal watchdog, which said the United States risked a bond market crisis of the kind that engulfed the United Kingdom under former Prime Minister Liz Truss. The US also has to pay interest on this growing debt. The government currently spends $2.4 billion on interest payments each day, according to the Peterson Foundation. Those payments are expected to double within the next decade as Treasuries issued during the period of near-zero interest rates mature and are replaced by bonds with higher yields. Why now: 82% of voters say they want the president and Congress to spend more time addressing the debt, and 80% say their level of concern has increased over the last few years, but government officials want to avoid talking about tax increases or reduced spending in an election year, said Hubbard. \u201cThis is not, as far as I can tell, much of a topic of the campaign,\u201d echoed Thomas. \u201cThat suggests to me that it\u2019s probably not going to be addressed.\u201d If that\u2019s the case, the 10-year US Treasury yield could hit \u201c5.5% before you have a lot of political pressure [it currently sits at 4.4%]. At that time we would have mortgage rates at 8%,\u201d he said. Trump Media lost more than $300 million last quarter on very little revenue Trump Media & Technology Group lost more than $300 million during the first quarter and generated very little revenue, the owner of Truth Social announced in a press release Monday. The results will raise additional questions about the multi-billion dollar valuation on the newly public company, which is majority owned by former President Donald Trump, reports my colleague Matt Egan. Trump Media (DJT) reported a loss of $327.6 million during the first three months of the year, compared with a loss of $210,300 a year earlier. In the press release, Trump Media said that at this \u201cearly stage\u201d in its development, the company \u201cremains focused on long-term product development, rather than quarterly revenue.\u201d It acknowledged that its advertising business is just getting off the ground and expressed confidence that new products like streaming will boost its results in the future. The company blamed the losses on non-cash expenses from the conversion of promissory notes and the elimination of previous liabilities. \u201cAfter an unprecedented, years-long process, we have consummated our merger and dispensed with the vast bulk of merger-related expenses, leaving the Company well-capitalized and supported by a legion of retail shareholders who believe in our mission to provide a free-speech beachhead against Big Tech censorship,\u201d Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes said in a statement. ` Trump Media reported an operating loss of $12.1 million, with a chunk of that being driven by one-time payments related to the closing of its merger with a blank-check company earlier this year. The company generated just $770,500 of revenue, marking the second-straight quarter where its revenue totaled less than $1 million. Trump Media said that it has \u201csufficient\u201d cash to fund the business \u201cfor the foreseeable future.\u201d The company listed a cash balance of $274 million as of the end of March \u2014 a sum boosted by its deal to go public. FDIC Chair Martin Gruenberg will resign following a scathing investigation that detailed a toxic workplace Martin Gruenberg, head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, will step down following a scathing independent investigation detailing pervasive sexual harassment, discrimination and bullying at the agency charged with regulating the banking sector, reports my colleague Elisabeth Buchwald. \u201cIn light of recent events, I am prepared to step down from my responsibilities once a successor is confirmed,\u201d Gruenberg said in a statement on Monday. \u201cUntil that time, I will continue to fulfill my responsibilities as Chairman of the FDIC, including the transformation of the FDIC\u2019s workplace culture.\u201d Gruenberg\u2019s announcement of his intent to resign comes hours after Sen. Sherrod Brown, a top Democrat who leads the Senate Banking Committee,\u00a0called for \u201cnew leadership\u201d\u00a0at the FDIC. \ufeffGruenberg joined the FDIC board of directors almost two decades ago. He\u2019s served as chair of the agency for nearly 10 of the past 13 years. The FDIC commissioned a report by law firm Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton, which ultimately spurred Gruenberg\u2019s resignation. It confirmed the findings of a November\u00a0Wall Street Journal investigation\u00a0revealing a long-standing problematic culture. It did not find that Gruenberg alone was responsible for the issues described in depth in the report based on interviews with over 500 employees. However, it documented several instances where Gruenberg lashed out at subordinates \u201cparticularly when being delivered bad news or conveyed views with which he disagrees.\u201d That caused staffers to delay delivering news they feared would upset him. Gruenberg\u2019s temperament \u201cmay hinder his ability to establish trust and confidence in leading meaningful culture change,\u201d the report added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_media_nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash", "text": "Cesar Conde has a decision to make \u2014 and it\u2019s not an especially difficult one. The NBCUniversal News Group chair is facing a torrent of backlash from his own staff after greenlighting the hire of former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel as a paid network contributor. Over the last 24 hours, the most prominent and recognizable NBC News and MSNBC personalities have voiced strong displeasure with the company\u2019s decision to welcome McDaniel to \u201cthe team.\u201d And they\u2019re not doing it via anonymous comments to the press. They\u2019re doing it on the record on NBCU\u2019s own air. Chuck Todd broke the dam on Sunday\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with a set of candid comments about the hiring, and Rachel Maddow capped the flood of backlash Monday night with a blistering 30-minute monologue eviscerating the network\u2019s leadership for the \u201cinexplicable\u201d move. Suffice to say, NBCU News Group is in unprecedented territory. Never has a network\u2019s C-suite ever been so thoroughly flogged by its most high-profile stars in such no holds barred fashion. Saying that Conde simply has a crisis on his hands would be a contender for understatement of the year. It\u2019s a five-alarm fire at NBCU News Group, and one of Conde\u2019s own making. While NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown were most directly responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring, a decision that MSNBC boss Rashida Jones did not object to it at the time, the buck ultimately stops with Conde, who hold the real power at the Peacock Network. McDaniel\u2019s hiring could not have happened without Conde\u2019s blessing. It does not take a brilliant political mind with prescient foresight to understand that hiring McDaniel would ignite a firestorm of outrage \u2014 from both within 30 Rock and outside it. Conde, someone who ostensibly supports American democracy, should have rejected McDaniel\u2019s hiring on the grounds that NBCU News Group could not put someone on its payroll who tried to subvert the 2020 vote. As so many of NBCU\u2019s staffers have underscored, the objection to McDaniel is not that she is a Republican. It\u2019s not even that she is a Donald Trump-supporting Republican. It\u2019s that she was an active participant in the plot to overthrow the last presidential election. That is not to even mention McDaniel\u2019s years of demonizing the press, smearing the journalists who work at NBC News and MSNBC as she sought to destroy the credibility of the organization that she ran to after being chased out of the RNC. The notion put forward by NBC that it needed to hire McDaniel to bring its viewers \u201can insider\u2019s perspective on national politics and the future of the Republican Party\u201d is absurd. If that\u2019s the case, the network should move to hire free agents like Tucker Carlson or Candace Owens. They too have their hands on the pulse of the Republican Party. In fact, they represent much more of where the GOP stands today than McDaniel. So, using NBC\u2019s logic, why not hire them? (Spoiler: News organizations rightfully have established basic standards for paid contributors. Asking that your employees have a commitment to democracy, to the truth, and to basic decency is not a big ask.) But even if Conde has no allegiance to basic democratic principles, which this hire calls into question, given that he is known to be a political player who cares deeply about his own image in the press, he should have been wise enough to foresee that hiring McDaniel would be an ill-conceived move. How this did not occur to Conde is unfathomable and shows a tremendous lack of judgment. Even more bizarre is Conde\u2019s management, or lack thereof, since the controversy erupted. It was clear early on that his employees at NBC News and MSNBC did not support McDaniel\u2019s hiring. If that was not evident on Friday, it was clear as day on Sunday after \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d The network\u2019s employees were not only flabbergasted and demoralized by the move, but absolutely enraged by it. At that point, the writing should have been on the wall for Conde \u2014 as it was for every other media executive that I have spoken with over the last 24 hours. It is evident that McDaniel has no real future as an NBC analyst and the decision to bring her on as a contributor will have to be reversed. After all, which NBC or MSNBC program is going to invite her on after all of this? The only real question for Conde after the Sunday morning scolding should have been how he chose to back out of the deal in the least painful way possible. To be fully honest, I very much expected a Sunday evening announcement from NBC, one that would have earned praise from the company\u2019s staff and quickly been swept away by the rush of Trump news Monday morning. But no such announcement came. Instead, Conde has allowed the mess to spiral absolutely out of control. MSNBC\u2019s top stars hammered the network\u2019s leadership throughout the day Monday over the hire. NBC News\u2019 Guild blasted Conde, saying in a statement that under him the company had quietly laid off employees over the last month and instead chosen to \u201cprioritize an election denier over its reporters.\u201d The already severe crisis was allowed to blossom into one of the worst corporate public relations catastrophes in recent memory. All the while, Conde has remained silent. I asked his spokesperson, Stephen Labaton, on Monday whether the NBCU News Group boss had any comment on the situation. Does he have any regret? I didn\u2019t get an on-the-record response. Suffice to say, however, that what Conde does moving forward will say a lot about his character and commitment to democratic values. It will also say a lot about the NBCU News Group and what type of organization it is. In her biting monologue on Monday night, however, Maddow did offer Conde a way out of this mess. \u201cMistakes will be made,\u201d Maddow said.\u201dBut our resilience as a democracy is going to be recognizing when decisions are bad ones and reversing those bad decisions. Hearing legitimate criticism, responding to it, and correcting course. Not digging in. Not blaming others. Take a minute. Acknowledge that maybe it wasn\u2019t the right call.\u201d \u201cIt is a sign of strength, not weakness, to acknowledge when you are wrong,\u201d Maddow added. \u201cIt is a sign of strength. And our country needs us to be strong now.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/media/nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_media_nbc-news-ousts-ronna-mcdaniel", "text": "NBC News on Tuesday ousted former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel, just days after her hiring as a paid political analyst sparked intense backlash from the network\u2019s top television anchors over McDaniel\u2019s role in subverting the 2020 election and attacks on the press. \u201cThere is no doubt that the last several days have been difficult for the News Group,\u201d NBCUniversal News Group President Cesar Conde said in a memo to staff. \u201cAfter listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor.\u201d \u201cI want to personally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down,\u201d Conde continued. \u201cWhile this was a collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team, I approved it and take full responsibility for it.\u201d Ahead of the network\u2019s decision, McDaniel spent the day Tuesday interviewing attorneys in preparation for a potential legal battle with NBC, a person familiar with the matter told CNN. Creative Artists Agency, the talent agency that brokered McDaniel\u2019s deal with NBC, also parted ways with her, the person said. The reversal comes after journalists and anchors at both NBC and its cable news sibling MSNBC publicly denounced the decision to hire McDaniel as a paid analyst in a stunning and unprecedented on-air rebuke of network brass that has embarrassed the Peacock Network. McDaniel, who recently stepped down from the RNC under pressure from former President Donald Trump, was involved in attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. As head of the RNC, she was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d In the years since, McDaniel continued to claim that the election had \u201cproblems\u201d and that Biden did not legitimately win the election, fanning the flames of election denialism. NBC\u2019s announcement Friday that it had hired McDaniel was quickly met with alarm by the network\u2019s journalists. The revolt spilled into public view on Sunday when McDaniel appeared on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with moderator Kristen Welker in her first interview since she was hired by the network. Welker disclosed that the interview had been scheduled to take place prior to NBC announcing McDaniel would become a paid contributor for the network, stating that she had no involvement in her hiring. Following the interview, Chuck Todd, NBC News\u2019 chief political analyst, delivered a stinging on-air criticism of NBC executives for their decision to hire McDaniel, telling Welker, \u201cI think our bosses owe you an apology for putting you in this situation.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a reason a lot of journalists at NBC News are uncomfortable with this,\u201d Todd said, explaining that under McDaniel, the RNC engaged in \u201cgaslighting\u201d and \u201ccharacter assassination\u201d when dealing with the news media. The following day, MSNBC hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough joined Todd in protesting the decision on their program \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d \u201cTo be clear, we believe NBC News should seek out conservative Republican voices to provide balance in their election coverage, but it should be conservative Republicans, not a person who used her position of power to be an anti-democracy election denier,\u201d\u00a0Brzezinski said. \u201cWe hope NBC will reconsider its decision. It goes without saying that she will not be a guest on \u2018Morning Joe\u2019 in her capacity as a paid contributor.\u201d Nicolle Wallace, host of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cDeadline: White House,\u201d later joined in the rebuke, saying on her program that the network\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel was nothing short of a potential threat to democracy. \u201cNBC News is, either wittingly or unwittingly, teaching election deniers that what they can do stretches well beyond appearing on our air and interviews to peddle lies about the sanctity and integrity of our elections,\u201d Wallace told viewers. Rachel Maddow \u2014 the network\u2019s biggest star \u2014 later devoted the first half-hour of her prime-time program to the controversy, saying the decision to hire McDaniel was \u201cinexplicable.\u201d Maddow took issue with McDaniel\u2019s long track record of demonizing the news media, labeling the press as \u201cfake news,\u201d and launching ugly attacks on NBC News journalists and MSNBC hosts. \u201cWe do not take it personally when we get attacked, when they say they want to put us on trial and execute us for treason,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so I want to associate myself with all my colleagues at MSNBC and NBC News who have voiced loud and principled objections to our company for putting on the payroll someone who hasn\u2019t just attacked us as journalists, but someone who is part of an ongoing project to get rid of our system of government,\u201d she said of McDaniel. \u201cSomeone who is still trying to convince Americans that this election stuff doesn\u2019t really work. That this last election wasn\u2019t a real result. That American elections are fraudulent.\u201c The on-air revolt ensnared NBC\u2019s top leaders, including NBCUniversal News Group chair Cesar Conde, NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown, who were responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring. MSNBC president Rashida Jones also did not object to the decision, people familiar with the matter said. In the wake of Conde\u2019s announcement to sever ties with McDaniel, MSNBC host Joy Reid and Maddow addressed the reversal on the network\u2019s air, praising the move as \u201cbold\u201d and \u201cstrong.\u201d \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/media/nbc-news-ousts-ronna-mcdaniel/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2023_11_21_opinions_sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic", "text": "The biggest tech news this week is the\u00a0ouster\u00a0of Sam Altman from his role as CEO of OpenAI, a move that has shaken the company and the industry. Hundreds of OpenAI employees have threatened to\u00a0resign. Altman has already\u00a0moved on\u00a0to a role at Microsoft. And OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is on its\u00a0third CEO\u00a0in as many days. It\u2019s all very juicy. But this drama should also be raising larger questions, far beyond one company\u2019s internal hirings and firings, including: Who are the people making the decisions\u00a0that will determine so much of our technological future? What guiding principles are they using to make those decisions? And how should other institutions \u2013 governments, non-tech industries, global alliances, regulatory bodies \u2013 reign in the worst excesses of potentially dangerous AI innovators? OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, with an explicit mission to harness what may soon be superhuman intelligence \u201cto benefit humanity as a whole.\u201d But that sensibility hasn\u2019t lasted. The company now has a multi-billion-dollar for-profit arm. They have been developing new technologies at lightning speed, and sometimes sending them out to the public\u00a0before some employees believed they were ready. The company has already reportedly invented an AI technology so dangerous they will never release it \u2013 but they also\u00a0won\u2019t tell\u00a0reporters or the public exactly what it is. This dynamic \u2013 a potentially dangerous technology developed at extreme speed, largely behind closed doors \u2013 is partly to blame for Altman\u2019s firing. The OpenAI board, according to\u00a0CNN\u2019s David Goldman, worried that \u201cthe company was making the technological equivalent of a nuclear bomb, and its caretaker, Sam Altman, was moving so fast that he risked a global catastrophe.\u201d At particular issue seemed to be Altman\u2019s efforts to make the tools behind ChatGPT available to anyone who wanted to make their own version of the chatbot. This could be widely disastrous, some board members worried. But then they fired him without warning, and apparently without involving Microsoft, the company\u2019s largest shareholder. Now, Altman is at the new AI group at Microsoft, and one has to wonder if the oversight and caution there will be on par with that at OpenAI, or if he\u2019ll be handed carte blanche to push as fast and hard as he wants. And for all the justified reticence of the OpenAI board, the company has carried out much of its work in secrecy \u2013 without the public really understanding what a handful of unaccountable technologists are building, and how it is nearly guaranteed to indelibly change their lives. AI is broadly understood to have the potential to reshape vast swaths of human existence. At the very least, it seems nearly guaranteed to change how we process information, how we communicate, how we learn and how we work (and if we work). And the ramifications could be much more extreme. AI technologies have already demonstrated the ability\u00a0to lie and to cover their tracks. They have already been able to\u00a0suggest the design\u00a0to make a virus spread more quickly. Many researchers\u00a0acutely understand\u00a0just how quickly these machines could develop the capacity to annihilate us, including Altman: He has a prepper\u2019s paradise prepared in Big Sur, complete with guns and \u201cgas masks from the Israeli Defense Force\u201d in case AI goes off the rails and the robots go to war against humans,\u00a0according to reporting in the New Yorker. But don\u2019t worry, he told an Atlantic reporter: If AI is determined to wipe us out, \u201cno gas mask is helping anyone.\u201d (If you want an excellent and terrifying rundown of AI\u2019s risks \u2013 at least those we understand right now, which are almost certainly a mere sliver of the looming perils \u2013\u00a0the Atlantic profile of Altman and his technology\u00a0is worth a read). AI is very exciting technology. But it is also a potentially very dangerous one, and not in the social media sense of \u201cit may give us bad self-esteem and make us lonelier\u201d but in the sense of \u201cit could break down human societies and kill us all.\u201d Given the life-altering potential of AI \u2013 that even if it doesn\u2019t kill us all, it will almost certainly change human existence in unprecedented ways at unprecedented speed \u2013 we all have a stake in how it\u2019s being developed. And yet the development is being left to a handful of people (who seem to be\u00a0largely\u00a0men) in Silicon Valley, and other tech pockets around the globe. And we all have a stake in whose interests AI will serve \u2013 and right now, its development is being funded with billions of dollars by people expecting to make a huge profit. Do the interests of the public align with the interests of the shareholders to whom profit-driven, potentially tremendously lucrative-for-a-few companies are beholden? Or with the interests of tech entrepreneurs who are primarily excited about being at the forefront of the AI revolution, regardless of the potential human costs? One thing is clear: AI is coming. And how it is built and unleashed on the public matters more than perhaps any technology of the past century. It is, indeed, up there with the atom bomb in its destructive potential \u2013 except likely more difficult to regulate and control. \u201cRegulation\u201d does not begin to scratch the surface of what\u2019s needed to make sure that the AI future is not a catastrophic one, especially since the development of AI is now a massive international arms race, with particularly horrific implications if bad actors develop this technology first. But regulation is, at minimum, a necessary step. So is transparency: In the US, companies have wide leverage to work behind a veil of secrecy, and much of what AI companies do is kept secret to stymy competition. But the public certainly has a right to understand what life-altering technologies are set to be inflicted upon us, and what the creators are doing to protect humanity \u2013 our jobs, our communities, our families, our connections, our educations and our abilities to build a life of purpose, but also our lives and our safety. The Altman story is fascinating because Altman is the most powerful figure in AI technology, which in effect makes him one of the most powerful men in the world. But that should give us pause: Who is he, what power does he hold, what is he doing with it, who does he answer to, and are we comfortable with this much life-altering potential being held by a few unaccountable people?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/21/opinions/sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_21_investing_jamie-dimon-jpmorgan-succession-plan", "text": "JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has bumped up his retirement plans, the longtime head of America\u2019s largest bank said Monday. Dimon is one of the most well-known and closely listened to CEOs in the world. Over the course of his tenure at JPMorgan Chase, he\u2019s become somewhat synonymous with the largest US bank by assets. But Dimon can\u2019t lead forever, and at 68 years old, the question of succession has grown more important. The timetable for stepping down \u2014 which he has long joked was \u201cfive years away\u201d any time the question was put to him \u2014 is \u201cnot five years anymore,\u201d Dimon said at the bank\u2019s investor conference this week. Dimon, who has led the bank since 2006, said that while \u201cI still have the energy I\u2019ve always had, I think when I can\u2019t put on the jersey or any given full thing, I should leave.\u201d Succession plans at the bank, he said, are \u201cwell on the way.\u201d Shares of the company\u2019s stock sold off after Dimon\u2019s announcement, closing 4.3% lower. \u201cWe believe that it will take time for the street to gain comfort with the next CEO and [Monday\u2019s] stock reaction was evidence of that (if one was needed),\u201d wrote Bank of America analysts in a note on Tuesday.\u00a0\u201cDimon\u00a0has delivered unparalleled shareholder returns during his tenure as CEO while navigating the bank through some major macro-economic crises.\u201d The Bank of America analysts forecast that Dimon will step down in late 2025 or 2026, but the specifics of JPMorgan\u2019s succession plans have been the subject of speculation on Wall Street for many years. Picking a successor Earlier this year, some of the bank\u2019s top executives were moved into new roles in order to expand their experience. The bank appointed Marianne Lake as the sole CEO of the consumer division, an area previously run by both Lake and Jennifer Piepszak. Piepszak, meanwhile, now leads the company\u2019s newly combined commercial and investment bank with her co-CEO Troy Rohrbaugh. Rohrbaugh is the former head of trading and securities services for the bank. Other potential successors include Mary Erdoes, CEO of asset and wealth management; chief financial officer Jeremy Barnum and president and chief operating officer Daniel Pinto. In 2020, Dimon experienced an \u201cacute aortic dissection\u201d \u2014 a tear in the inner lining of the aorta blood vessel \u2014 requiring surgery. Then co-COOs Gordon Smith and Daniel Pinto lead the company in his absence. Smith retired from the bank in January 2022. Looking ahead Dimon\u00a0underwent treatment\u00a0for throat cancer in 2014. In an interview with CNN, he spoke about how being diagnosed with cancer changed his outlook on life. \u201cEveryone knows they\u2019re going to die, but at one point it\u2019s right here and you realize it\u2019s true and it\u2019s true maybe sooner than you think,\u201d Dimon said. \u201cAnd so it\u2019s nice to end every day by saying, \u2018That was a good day.\u2019 Every meeting, that was a good meeting. Every week, that was a good week.\u201d As for what\u2019s next, Dimon says he hasn\u2019t entirely ruled out a future in politics. Last spring\u00a0he told Bloomberg, \u201cI love my country, and maybe one day I\u2019ll serve my country in one capacity or another.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/investing/jamie-dimon-jpmorgan-succession-plan/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_21_food_mar-jac-plant-poultry-death", "text": "Children have again been found working at a Mar-Jac Poultry slaughterhouse, according to the US Department of Labor. The latest discovery in Alabama comes less than a year after a teen worker was killed at a company facility in Mississippi. In a civil complaint filed May 7, the DOL said that investigators at its wage and hour division \u201cdiscovered oppressive child labor at [Mar-Jac\u2019s] poultry processing facility, namely children working on the kill floor deboning poultry and cutting carcasses.\u201d The complaint added that \u201cthe children had been working at the facility for months.\u201d Mar-Jac operates facilities in Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia. The DOL\u2019s recent allegation follows an incident last year in which a teen died at a Mar-Jac facility in Mississippi. According to Mar-Jac Poultry Alabama\u2019s website, \u201cMar-Jac Poultry does not sell to the general public, individual restaurants or convenience stores. We sell primarily to wholesale distributors and various national fast food establishments.\u201d It didn\u2019t list which fast food companies it supplied. A DOL spokesperson told CNN Tuesday that \u201cthe wage and hour division has multiple ongoing investigations of Mar-Jac plants in Alabama and Mississippi.\u201d Federal labor law bans children from certain jobs in slaughterhouses and meat packaging plants, including using or cleaning machinery, because of the hazardous conditions. In the May complaint, the Labor department said Mar-Jac had employed \u201cseveral minors under the age of 18 in the particularly hazardous occupations of working on the kill floor.\u201d The jobs included \u201changing poultry along fast-moving machine lines, de-boning poultry, and cutting poultry carcasses.\u201d The complaint added that products coming out of the facility through the end of the month are \u201ctainted by child labor,\u201d making them \u201chot goods\u201d under the Fair Labor Standards Act. That means Mar-Jac has been \u201cunjustly enriched, accruing substantial ill-gotten gains,\u201d by shipment of these goods in violation of labor law, the complaint said. \u201cMar-Jac will continue to vigorously defend itself and expects to prevail in this matter,\u201d according to a company statement sent to CNN. \u201cMar-Jac is committed to complying with all relevant laws, including but not limited to the child labor regulations, and already has taken affirmative steps to go beyond what the regulations require.\u201d The workers in question had given the company documents showing they were over 18, according to the statement, which noted that Mar-Jac has a policy against hiring minors. The allegations come after a 16-year-old worker was killed at a Mar-Jac processing plant in Mississippi in July. He was the second employee who died while working at the facility in just over two years. Mar-Jac Poultry told CNN at the time that the teen died from injuries suffered in what it described as an \u201caccident.\u201d The company added that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which reviews workplace injuries among other labor issues, was investigating the incident with the \u201cfull support and cooperation of the company.\u201d Earlier this year, the DOL proposed a $212,646 fine against the processor. When asked about the status of the request by CNN, the spokesperson said that the department can\u2019t offer further comment as its investigations are ongoing. The Labor Department has lately been trying to crack down on incidents of child labor, especially at meatpacking facilities. In February 2023, the Department of Labor and Health and Human Services said that they were increasing efforts to fight child labor. The DOL noted at the time that it had seen a 69% increase in the illegal employment of children by companies. A janitorial company was recently fined $649,000 after an investigation found it hired minors for dangerous jobs cleaning slaughterhouses. Fayette Janitorial Service had employed at least 24 children, including those as young as 13, according to the DOL investigation. The minors had been working overnight shifts at two separate slaughter facilities, according to the DOL. \u2014 CNN\u2019s Parija Kavilanz and Amy Simonson contributed to this report.

{"id": "2024_05_23_business_takeaways-house-campus-antisemitism-hearing", "text": "The House Committee on Education and the Workforce\u2019s hearing on campus antisemitism Thursday came with no shortage of fiery exchanges between lawmakers and the heads of Northwestern University, Rutgers University and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). But unlike two prior hearings, Thursday\u2019s was the first to take place after a wave of pro-Palestinian encampments spread across campuses nationwide, disrupting learning and commencement ceremonies and ultimately causing many students to feel unsafe. Here are some of the most important takeaways from the hearing that lasted several hours. University heads can\u2019t win Northwestern President Michael Schill and Rutgers University President Dr. Jonathan Holloway negotiated with protesters rather than authorizing police to disband encampments, which UCLA Chancellor Gene Block ultimately did. Both approaches received considerable rebuke from lawmakers on the Republican-led committee. Schill and Holloway were accused of being complicit with protesters, though some Democratic lawmakers found their approaches admirable. \u201cI for one am interested in hearing and learning about what successful negotiation and de-escalation looks like in the context of protecting students and free speech,\u201d Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat from Washington state, said. Meanwhile, Block was criticized by some lawmakers for not authorizing police to step in sooner. Block agreed more action should have been taken earlier, saying, \u201cWith the benefit of hindsight, we should have been prepared to immediately remove the encampment if and when the safety of our community was put at risk.\u201d A lot of investigations but limited consequences yet In one of the hearing\u2019s tensest exchanges, Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik slammed Schill\u00a0for not taking any action against someone who allegedly told a Jewish student to \u201cgo back to Germany and get gassed.\u201d Schill said that he heard about that happening and \u201cit is being investigated.\u201d\u00a0So far, no students who are being investigated for various alleged acts of antisemitism have been expelled or suspended, he said. Rutgers\u2019 Holloway and UCLA\u2019s Block similarly said the universities have many active investigations underway. Holloway said his school has suspended four people and 19 others have received additional disciplinary actions. A bounty of lawyerly responses If you tuned in to Thursday\u2019s hearing and thought the responses university heads gave were pre-rehearsed, it\u2019s because they likely were. The three university heads at the hearing had the advantage of learning from the prior campus hearings. All were especially keen on not repeating the mistake made by University of Pennsylvania President Liz Magill and other school presidents who did not explicitly say calls for the genocide of Jews violated their codes of conduct. But the school leaders on Thursday still leaned into giving lawyerly responses, especially in tense lines of questioning to avoid being cornered into taking a stance on divisive issues. For instance, when Holloway was asked if he thought Israel\u2019s government was genocidal he responded, \u201cSir, I don\u2019t have an opinion on Israel\u2019s \u2014 in terms of that phrase.\u201d Meanwhile, Schill said more than once that he would not comment on individual students or faculty members in the hearing.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/business/takeaways-house-campus-antisemitism-hearing/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_22_media_ronna-mcdaniel-nbc", "text": "NBC News on Friday announced that it had hired Ronna McDaniel, the former Republican National Committee chair who has repeatedly\u00a0attacked the network and its journalists,\u00a0assailed the\u00a0news\u00a0media as \u201cfake news\u201d and promoted false claims around the 2020\u00a0vote,\u00a0as an on-air commentator\u00a0ahead of the 2024 presidential election. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be a more important moment to have a voice like Ronna\u2019s on the team,\u201d Carrie Budoff Brown, senior vice president of politics at NBC News, said in a memo\u00a0to staff. McDaniel exited the RNC earlier this month after leading the organization since 2016. During her time as chair, McDaniel repeatedly attacked the press, which has become increasingly popular in Republican circles over the last several years as Donald Trump demonizes journalists and news institutions. McDaniel echoed many such attacks, labeling the press as \u201cfake news\u201d and calling the media \u201ccorrupt.\u201d At times, she even targeted NBC News\u00a0and MSNBC\u00a0with dishonest attacks. In 2019, for instance, McDaniel accused Richard Engel, NBC News\u2019 chief foreign correspondent, of \u201cactively cheering for an economic downturn.\u201d \u201cHow can NBC let him keep his job when he\u2019s made his bias so clear?\u201d McDaniel asked. McDaniel has a lengthier history attacking the progressive cable news channel MSNBC, which she will appear on in her new role. In recent years, she has repeatedly attacked the channel for \u201cspreading lies\u201d and blasted those she described as the network\u2019s \u201cprimetime propagandists.\u201d An NBC spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment about her attacks on the news media and NBC. In her role as RNC chief, McDaniel also fanned the flames of election denialism after the 2020 presidential contest. McDaniel was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d The Michigan Department of State\u2019s office condemned her claims of supposed voter fraud in the wake of the election, stating they had \u201cno merit.\u201d\u00a0The state\u2019s \u201celections were conducted fairly, effectively and transparently and are an accurate reflection of the will of Michigan voters,\u201d it said in a\u00a0detailed fact check\u00a0posted online. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Chris Wallace last year, McDaniel defended her claims of voting \u201cirregularity\u201d in the election. \u201cI think saying that there were problems with 2020 is very real. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s election denying,\u201d McDaniel told Wallace. \u201cI\u2019m from Wayne County. We had a woman send a note saying I\u2019m being told to backdate ballots. We had to look into that. That\u2019s deeply concerning. When you have friends who are poll-watching and being kicked out, that\u2019s deeply concerning. We have every right to look at that.\u201d In the interview,\u00a0Wallace pressed McDaniel if she believed Biden legitimately won the election. \u201cI think there were lots of problems with 2020. Ultimately, he won the election\u00a0but there were lots of problems with the 2020 election,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think he won it fair. I don\u2019t. I\u2019m not going to say that.\u201d NBC\u2019s hiring of McDaniel, however, plays into a recent trend at the\u00a0network\u2019s outlets, which has seemingly softened its stance on Trump as he inches toward the Republican nomination for president. Earlier this month, CNBC hosted Trump for a lengthy phone interview in which the network\u2019s anchors allowed him to peddle lies and conspiracy theories on air\u00a0without scrutiny. MSNBC has even started carrying Trump\u2019s remarks live on television, a practice that the network boasted for years it would not do. Star host Rachel Maddow, who has said carrying Trump\u2019s lies\u00a0on the air\u00a0is dangerous, even objected to the network broadcasting a recent speech from the presumptive Republican nominee, calling it \u201cirresponsible.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/22/media/ronna-mcdaniel-nbc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_business_russian-frozen-assets-g7-ukraine", "text": "Money generated by Russian financial assets frozen in Europe will soon start flowing to Ukraine, giving Kyiv a boost as it struggles to counter an advance by Moscow\u2019s troops. Now, the West is trying to turn that trickle of cash into a flood. Finance ministers from the Group of Seven advanced economies are discussing Friday new ways of using the proceeds from some \u20ac260 billion ($282 billion) of Russia\u2019s foreign currency reserves that were frozen by Western countries after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The G7 meeting in Italy comes just weeks after Russia mounted a surprise assault in Ukraine\u2019s northern Kharkiv region. As Russia\u2019s attacks intensify, Western leaders are coming under increasing pressure to deliver military aid to Kyiv\u2019s stretched armed forces. It is \u201cvital and urgent that we collectively find a way forward to unlock the value of Russian sovereign assets immobilized in our jurisdictions for the benefit of Ukraine,\u201d US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said during a speech Tuesday in Frankfurt, Germany. The proposal that reportedly has the broadest backing among US and EU officials involves lending as much as $50 billion to Ukraine, using the future windfall profits from Russian assets held in the European Union as collateral. The plan \u201cwould essentially bring forward that flow of interest proceeds from the assets\u2026 (through a loan) given to Ukraine,\u201d Yellen told broadcaster Sky News in an interview this week. \u201cUkraine has substantial needs, and being able to marshal significant resources to help Ukraine is important,\u201d she said. G7 finance ministers hope to agree on a way forward that can be signed off when President Joe Biden and other leaders meet for a summit in Italy next month. The plan stops short of seizing the assets outright. The EU is worried that such a move would discourage other countries from keeping their assets in the bloc. Most of the frozen Russian money is held in Europe, and the euro is the world\u2019s second-most important currency after the US dollar. The proposal \u201cis a halfway house to full seizure,\u201d Lee Buccheit, a veteran sovereign debt expert and honorary professor at the University of Edinburgh Law School, told CNN. From $3 billion to $50 billion? Around two-thirds of Russia\u2019s immobilized assets, or some \u20ac210 billion ($228 billion), sits in the EU, mostly at Euroclear, a Belgium-based financial institution that keeps assets safe for banks, exchanges and investors. Following months of discussions, the EU formally adopted an agreement Tuesday that taps the windfall profits Euroclear makes by reinvesting the cash generated by those assets \u2014 such as coupon payments on bonds. Western sanctions mean coupon payments and maturing assets cannot be sent to Russia. Under the EU agreement, between \u20ac2.5 and \u20ac3 billion ($2.7-3.3 billion) of these profits will be sent annually to Kyiv. The first payment will be made in July, with 90% earmarked for arms and military equipment. The split of funds will be reviewed each year starting in January 2025, with the option to shift spending toward rebuilding Ukraine\u2019s war-torn economy as its needs change. \u201cThe EU has chosen a way forward that is legally sound, and flexible so that support can adjust to Ukraine\u2019s most pressing needs,\u201d European Commissioner for Trade Valdis Dombrovskis said in a statement Tuesday. Unlike the drip feed of funding agreed by the EU, the proposal under discussion by the G7 could deliver a much bigger lump sum, immediately.  Reuters reported Yellen as saying Thursday that a figure of $50 billion had been discussed by G7 ministers but there was no agreement yet on how big the collateralized loan should be. An even bigger check? Apart from seizing the stash of assets, or lending Kyiv money backed by the interest they earn, there\u2019s a third option the West might consider \u2014 a so-called reparations loan. Under this approach, Ukraine would borrow money from a syndicate of allies, including G7 members, and pledge as collateral its claim for reparations \u2014 or compensation \u2014 against Russia. This would give Kyiv access to a much larger amount of money than using future or current windfall profits from Russian assets. \u201cUkraine has a claim against Russia for reparations \u2014 legally, that is indubitable \u2014 and it would in effect be monetizing a portion of that claim by pledging it to secure this loan from the G7,\u201d Buchheit, the debt expert, said. If Russia failed to pay reparations, then the G7 would be in a position to draw on the pool of frozen assets to recover the value of its loan to Ukraine, he added. This mechanism also ensures that Russia foots part of the colossal bill for rebuilding Ukraine, which the World Bank has put at $486 billion over the next decade. \u201cShort of a regime change in Russia, Putin is never going to pay reparations,\u201d said Buccheit. \u201cThis $300 billion is probably the only contribution Russia will ever make for paying reparations for what it has done to Ukraine.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/business/russian-frozen-assets-g7-ukraine/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_judges-stern-rebuke-of-elon-musks-x-gives-researchers-fresh-hope", "text": "A federal judge\u2019s decision this week reprimanding Elon Musk\u2019s X will have reverberating effects on efforts to hold influential online platforms accountable, legal experts and advocacy groups say. On Monday, District Judge Charles Breyer dismissed and excoriated a lawsuit by X against online watchdog group Center for Countering Digital Hate as an attempt to silence the non-profit group for sounding alarms about hate speech on the platform. Breyer wrote in Monday\u2019s order that the lawsuit was \u201cunabashedly\u201d about \u201cpunishing\u201d reports written by CCDH, which X had accused of campaigning to drive away its advertisers. Breyer held that the reports were \u201cunquestionably\u201d protected by the group\u2019s free speech rights. Now, that decision could embolden other research groups and Musk critics who have faced legal threats from the billionaire. The CCDH case \u2014 in the US District Court for the Northern District of California \u2014\u00a0has been widely viewed as a bellwether for research and accountability on X, where Musk has restored the accounts of previously banned White supremacists and spreaders of misinformation and where Musk himself has amplified various conspiracy theories. And CCDH is not the only organization that has faced attacks by self-proclaimed \u201cfree speech absolutist\u201d Musk after criticizing or raising concerns about his platform. \u201cThis is an important decision that sees Elon Musk\u2019s lawsuit for what it is \u2014 an effort to punish his critics for constitutionally protected speech and to deter researchers from studying his platform,\u201d said Alex Abdo, litigation director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, which had filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the case arguing that private companies should not be allowed to use breach of contract claims to punish criticism. \u201cSociety needs reliable and ethical research into social media platforms, and often that research relies on being able to study publicly available posts,\u201d Abdo said. X said it plans to appeal Breyer\u2019s decision. Musk\u2019s threats against X critics In his first year as owner of X, formerly known as Twitter, Musk threatened legal action against the Anti-Defamation League for defamation, as well as against Microsoft and Meta for allegedly improper data and trade secret access, respectively. None of those threats ever amounted to real lawsuits. He did, however, sue the progressive media watchdog Media Matters over its\u00a0analysis\u00a0highlighting antisemitic and pro-Nazi content on X, alleging that the group\u2019s testing methodology was not representative of how real users experience the site and that the report was designed to drive away advertisers. Legal experts have described that case as \u201cweak\u201d on the merits and as a \u201cbogus\u201d attempt to chill criticism of X. This week\u2019s court decision may be only a temporary setback in Musk\u2019s wider plan to stifle criticism, said Media Matters CEO Angelo Carusone. Musk\u2019s new playbook, Carusone said, enlists the help of sympathetic Republican attorneys general to investigate independent reporting organizations and tie them up in legal proceedings. The states of Texas and Missouri each announced probes into Media Matters following X\u2019s lawsuit against the group, to which Musk responded, \u201cGreat!\u201d As recently as Monday, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey filed a petition in state court seeking to compel Media Matters\u2019 cooperation with his investigation. The filing came a week after he appeared with Musk in a live event on X \u2014 which Carusone said shows how Musk hopes to deputize the power of government to silence his critics. \u201cThey have every reason to do it,\u201d Carusone said of the AGs\u2019 investigations. \u201cThey get the political benefits, they get the attention. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any cost to them yet. And if they are successful at developing this new playbook, this new terrain, legally, then it\u2019s going to pave the way for them to just use this tool and tactic over and over and over again.\u201d A representative for X did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Carusone\u2019s claims. Researchers face hurdles to studying on-platform behavior Researchers from non-profits and academic institutions have had a harder time studying X since Musk\u2019s takeover in 2022. Academics need large samples of posts, shares, likes and other data to study social media trends in mis- and disinformation, public health, elections and other key topics. But one of Musk\u2019s first changes at X was to put access to platform data behind a steep paywall. Researchers and civil society groups said the new subscription fees \u2014 costing up to $2.5 million a year \u2014\u00a0were \u201coutrageously expensive\u201d and made it impossible to do their work, reducing transparency of a critical platform. The change may have forced some researchers to rely more heavily on first-person observational data to draw conclusions about user behavior on X. Groups like CCDH have also used automated \u201cscraping\u201d of publicly viewable content from X rather than paying the company for data directly, a tactic that helped give rise to X\u2019s initial lawsuit. Efforts by X and other social media companies to limit research transparency makes them less accountable to the public at best and, at worst, could mask malicious behavior, said David Karpf, an associate professor in the School of Media and Public Affairs at George Washington University. \u201cWe need independent research to have any real measure of what\u2019s going on at X/Twitter. Musk is only ever going to release data that makes his company look good,\u201d Karpf said. \u201cThese platforms are too big and too vital to the spread of information to be left unmonitored.\u201d \u201cThis is an election year,\u201d Karpf added, \u201cand the platforms are taking steps to make it harder to monitor how their services are used for malignant ends.\u201d Free Press, another media accountability organization that has been critical of Musk\u2019s leadership of X and which called for advertisers to pause their spending on the platform shortly after his takeover, also celebrated Breyer\u2019s ruling as potentially removing at least one hurdle that watchdog organizations face. \u201cThe guardrails for democracy are hanging by a thread and we have dwindling insights into platform practices as researchers face lawsuits, congressional subpoenas and other scare tactics,\u201d said Nora Benavidez, senior counsel and director of digital rights at Free Press. Ultimately, Benavidez called the ruling \u201ca reminder that platform accountability is essential and will inevitably prevail when up against bullies like Musk who try to silence us.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/judges-stern-rebuke-of-elon-musks-x-gives-researchers-fresh-hope/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "business"}}

But just days after the launch, the company is already walking back some factually incorrect results. Google earlier this month introduced an AI-generated search results overview tool, which summarizes search results so that users don\u2019t have to click through multiple links to get quick answers to their questions. But the feature came under fire this week after it provided false or misleading information to some users\u2019 questions. For example, several users posted on X that Google\u2019s AI summary said that former President Barack Obama is a Muslim, a common misconception. In fact, Obama is a Christian. Another user posted that a Google AI summary said that \u201cnone of Africa\u2019s 54 recognized countries start with the letter \u2018K\u2019\u201d \u2014 clearly forgetting Kenya. Google confirmed to CNN on Friday that the AI overviews for both queries had been removed for violating the company\u2019s policies. \u201cThe vast majority of AI Overviews provide high quality information, with links to dig deeper on the web,\u201d Google spokesperson Colette Garcia said in a statement, adding that some other viral examples of Google AI flubs appear to have been manipulated images. \u201cWe conducted extensive testing before launching this new experience, and as with other features we\u2019ve launched in Search, we appreciate the feedback. We\u2019re taking swift action where appropriate under our content policies.\u201d The bottom of each Google AI search overview acknowledges that \u201cgenerative AI is experimental.\u201d And the company says it conducts testing designed to imitate potential bad actors in an effort to prevent false or low-quality results from showing up in AI summaries. Google\u2019s search overviews are part of the company\u2019s larger push to incorporate its Gemini AI technology across all of its products as it attempts to keep up in the AI arms race with rivals like OpenAI and Meta. But this week\u2019s debacle shows the risk that adding AI \u2013 which has a tendency to confidently state false information \u2013 could undermine Google\u2019s reputation as the trusted source to search for information online. Even on less serious searches, Google\u2019s AI overview appears to sometimes provide wrong or confusing information. In one test, CNN asked Google, \u201chow much sodium is in pickle juice.\u201d The AI overview responded that an 8 fluid ounce-serving of pickle juice contains 342 milligrams of sodium but that a serving less than half the size (3 fluid ounces) contained more than double the sodium (690 milligrams). (Best Maid pickle juice, for sale at Walmart, lists 250 milligrams of sodium in just 1 ounce.) CNN also searched: \u201cdata used for google ai training.\u201d In its response, the AI overview acknowledged that \u201cit\u2019s unclear if Google prevents copyrighted materials from being included\u201d in the online data scraped to train its AI models, referencing a major concern about how AI firms operate. It\u2019s not the first time Google has had to walk back the capabilities of its AI tools over an embarrassing flub. In February, the company paused the ability of its AI photo generator to create images of people after it was blasted for producing historically inaccurate images that largely showed people of color in place of White people. Google\u2019s Search Labs webpage lets users in areas where AI search overviews have rolled out toggle the feature on and off.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/tech/google-search-ai-results-incorrect-fix/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_economy_consumer-travel-inflation-memorial-day", "text": "Americans may be sick and tired of dealing with high prices across pretty much every aspect of their lives, but inflation hasn\u2019t yet squashed the travel bug. And this Memorial Day weekend could be a case in point: Travelers are expected to come out in record-setting droves. US airports on Thursday saw their second-ever busiest day, as nearly 2.9 million travelers were screened at Transportation Security Administration checkpoints. Friday was expected to be even busier, TSA said. Traffic on the ground won\u2019t be any less packed: AAA is projecting that a record 38.4 million people will take road trips over the long weekend. Three-plus years of high inflation have taken their toll on Americans\u2019 budgets and, especially, their mindsets. But even though people may be feeling pinched, some are still willing to spend \u2014 if not splurge \u2014 on travel and leisure. \u201cThe truth is that although people complain about the economy and complain about inflation, overall, households are in very good shape in the United States,\u201d Gus Faucher, PNC Financial Services\u2019 chief economist, told CNN on Friday. Inflation has slowed during the past couple of years, pulling back significantly from its peak of 9.1% in June 2022. In April, it measured 3.4% annually, according to the Consumer Price Index. But it is still well above pre-pandemic levels: In February 2020, CPI measured 2.3% annually. Price hikes continue to hit hard, especially where consumers feel it most (their shelter, food and transportation). However, the job market is historically strong and incomes are outpacing inflation. \u201cPeople see [high gas] prices, and they feel like they\u2019re not keeping up,\u201d Faucher said. \u201cBut the truth is, they are. We see that very clearly in the consumer spending numbers.\u201d Taking flight for Taylor, buying tickets for Mickey Consumer spending has increased for 12 consecutive months, Commerce Department data shows. And those pandemic effects still run deep: Americans are putting their cash, and their credit, toward experiences. Disney\u2019s parks and experiences revenue grew roughly 11% during the second quarter from the year prior. The company said that while attendance isn\u2019t at the elevated levels seen following the end of Covid pandemic restrictions, it still rose at its US and Hong Kong Disneyland resorts. But it\u2019s not just Disney \u2014 consumers\u2019 appetite for travel remains robust and is expected to ramp up as the summer season kicks off. \u201cDemand continues to be strong, and we see a record spring and summer travel season,\u201d said Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian during a call with analysts last month. \u201cDelta\u2019s core consumers are in a healthy position and travel remains a top purchase priority.\u201d United Airlines also said in April that it expects both the airline and industry as a whole to report record passenger volumes during the summer. Credit some of that to Ms. Swift: United and Delta said this week that demand is on the rise for Taylor Swift\u2019s \u201cEras Tour\u201d destinations in Europe. And there is some good news on the inflation front in that regard: Airline fares dropped in April from March and are actually down a little more than 1% from February 2020, CPI data shows. Spending by land and by sea Cruise transactions, which include bookings and spending on board, were 16% higher in the first quarter of this year compared to the first quarter of 2019, according to a recent Mastercard Economics Institute report. The jump in cruise spending may be due to \u201cpersistent price increases in the hotel industry,\u201d the Mastercard report said. That\u2019s made cruises \u201ca relatively more budget-friendly option in many cases.\u201d Yet, many large hotel chains say they aren\u2019t seeing a significant pullback. For instance, Marriott International raised its full-year earnings guidance in first-quarter results reported on May 1. The company saw its global revenue per available room climb 4.2% from the year before. \u201cOur 2024 outlook still assumes continued sturdy travel demand and a continuation of current macroeconomic trends,\u201d said Kathleen Oberg, chief financial officer at Marriott, during a call with analysts. The boom times might not last much longer However, nothing lasts forever. Other key players in the travel industry have reported a similar trend this earnings season. Americans, especially lower-income consumers, have pulled back spending at retailers as goods inflation outpaces wage growth. They\u2019ve even become frugal with some experience-based spending like dining out, opting instead to eat at home. Still, some executives have warned that the appetite for travel doesn\u2019t match the boom seen right after Covid pandemic restrictions were lifted, and that the boost from that period is fading. Another source of potential woe is the uncertain economic environment. Pandemic-era savings have been spent while sticky inflation and high inflation rates eat into household budgets. The labor market has shown remarkable resilience through the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate hikes, but it cooled in April. Expedia Group lowered its full-year guidance, citing in part the slower-than-expected growth in gross bookings during the first quarter.   \u201cWe saw a healthy but more normalized market environment for travel globally,\u201d CEO Peter Kern told analysts earlier this month. \u201cWe are largely past the pandemic-driven recovery.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/economy/consumer-travel-inflation-memorial-day/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "business"}}

The EU gave the final green light to its AI act Tuesday, the same week tech leaders gathered in Paris for the annual VivaTech conference. The first-of-its-kind law is poised to reshape how firms and other organizations in Europe use AI for everything from health care decisions to policing. It imposes blanket bans on using the technology in ways deemed \u201cunacceptable\u201d \u2014 for example, for social scoring. The regulation also creates new disclosure obligations for large AI companies and requires more transparency on uses of AI considered \u201chigh-risk,\u201d such as for education and hiring. For Meta\u2019s (META) AI chief, Yann LeCun, \u201cthe big question\u201d about the new law is \u201cshould research and development in AI be regulated?\u201d \u201cThere are clauses in the EU AI act and various other places that do regulate research and development. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Anna Stewart at the Paris event. LeCun, widely known as one of the \u201cgodfathers of AI,\u201d disagrees with concerns that AI could soon surpass human intelligence. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it\u2019s anywhere close,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s that dangerous, frankly, certainly not today.\u201d AI systems might become a lot smarter in the future but then they will be designed with appropriate safeguards, he added. \u201cBut today, trying to figure out how to make future super-intelligent AI systems safe is like asking in 1925 \u2018how do we make jet transport safe?\u2019 And jet transport was not invented yet,\u201d he said. Amazon\u2019s (AMZN) chief technology officer Werner Vogels echoed concerns that AI regulation could stifle innovation in some areas. When thinking about risks, regulators should consider the application of the new technology to, for instance, health care and financial services differently from its use to summarize meetings, he told Stewart. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole range of areas where I think the risks are minimal and we should let innovation run there,\u201d he said. In other areas, where mistakes can have a bigger impact on people\u2019s lives, risks should be managed \u201cuniquely for that particular area.\u201d Vogels stressed that Amazon welcomes regulation, and is aligned with regulators in their overall goals, but warned the EU against overregulating AI, pointing to the example of its signature data privacy law, known as GDPR, which he described as a very \u201cthick\u201d book. \u201cLet\u2019s make sure that the regulatory requirements that we put in place, companies \u2014 not just the largest company but every company in Europe \u2014 can actually implement,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to make sure that innovation continues to happen and that the innovation doesn\u2019t just come outside Europe.

{"id": "2024_05_24_business_tesla-shanghai-battery-factory-trade-tariffs", "text": "Tesla broke ground on a new manufacturing plant in Shanghai on Thursday, just weeks after CEO Elon Musk made a surprise visit to China in a bid to shore up the carmaker\u2019s slumping sales. The factory, which was announced in April last year, aims to begin production in the first quarter of 2025. It will be able to make 10,000 Megapacks \u2014 very large batteries used to store huge amounts of electricity \u2014 each year, according to a statement by Lingang Group, the government-owned developer of the area housing the plant. The battery facility will be close to Tesla\u2019s Shanghai Gigafactory, which is the company\u2019s largest plant outside the United States, producing almost one million cars a year. Megapacks are meant to be used to help stabilize energy grids. Each unit can store enough energy on average to power 3,600 homes for one hour, the company says. They are designed to be deployed by utilities and power stations. The $200 million project comes as tensions between Beijing and Washington are rising over geopolitics and trade barriers, and underscores the US carmaker\u2019s commitment to China, the world\u2019s largest EV market and Tesla\u2019s primary vehicle export hub. \u201cFor Tesla, it\u2019s an important milestone,\u201d Tom Zhu, senior vice president of Tesla, was quoted as saying in an article posted on the Shanghai government website on Friday. Rising tensions While most Western companies are face rising barriers to doing business in China, things have been smoother for Tesla. Shanghai said Friday it had taken both sides only a month to negotiate and conclude a deal to build the factory on the land near Tesla\u2019s Gigafactory. The company was able to move similarly quickly when it built that first factory in 2019. Wu Xiaohua, a Shanghai government official, said at the commencement ceremony Thursday that the city would assist Tesla in finishing the construction and putting the factory into operation \u201cas soon as this year.\u201d Musk met with Chinese premier Li Qiang during his visit late last month. Li praised Tesla as a \u201csuccessful model\u201d for US-China collaboration. Beijing has been ramping up efforts to accelerate EV production to counter a property-induced economic slowdown and promote a low carbon economy. But as domestic demand weakens, Beijing is also encouraging manufacturers to seek new growth opportunities in overseas markets. That puts the industry at the heart of growing trade tensions with the US and Europe. Earlier this month, President Joe Biden said that\u00a0tariffs on $18 billion\u00a0worth of imports of Chinese electric vehicles (EVs) and an array of other products would soar over the next two years. EVs imported from China will see their tariffs nearly quadruple from 27.5% to 100%, a policy lever meant to challenge Beijing\u2019s practice of encouraging aggressively low pricing by domestic EV manufacturers while levying a 40% tariff on US car imports. The White House said the measures were designed to protect American workers and businesses in the face of China\u2019s unfair trade practices, including \u201cflooding global markets with artificially low-priced exports.\u201d Speaking in January, Musk said Chinese EV makers could put many of their rivals out of business unless tariffs were raised. \u201cFrankly, I think if there are not trade barriers established, they will pretty much demolish most other car companies in the world,\u201d Musk told analysts on an earnings call. At a tech conference in Paris this week, he struck a different tone, saying he was opposed to measures that distorted the market. \u201cNeither Tesla nor I asked for these tariffs, in fact I was surprised when they were announced,\u201d\u00a0Musk\u00a0told VivaTech 2024 via video link, according to Reuters. \u201cTesla competes quite well in the market in China with no tariffs and no deferential support.

AI capabilities have surged over the past few years, fast enough that regulators, companies and consumers are still figuring out how to use the technology responsibly. Concerns also continue to mount over how various industries and jobs will change as AI proliferates in the market. In January, researchers at MIT\u2019s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab found workplaces are adopting AI much more slowly than some had expected and feared. The report also said the majority of jobs previously identified as vulnerable to AI were not economically beneficial for employers to automate at that time. Experts also largely believe that many jobs that require a high emotional intelligence and human interaction will not need replacing, such as mental health professionals, creatives and teachers. Musk has been outspoken about his concerns around AI. During the keynote on Thursday, he called the technology his biggest fear. He cited the \u201cCulture Book Series\u201d by Ian Banks, a utopian fictionalized look at a society run by advanced technology, as the most realistic and \u201cthe best envisioning of a future AI.\u201d In a job-free future, though, Musk questioned whether people would feel emotionally fulfilled. \u201cThe question will really be one of meaning\u00a0 \u2013 if the computer and robots can do everything better than you, does your life have meaning?\u201d he said.\u00a0 \u201cI do think there\u2019s perhaps still a role for humans in this \u2013 in that we may give AI meaning.\u201d He also used his stage time to urge parents to limit the amount of social media that children can see because \u201cthey\u2019re being programmed by a dopamine-maximizing AI.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/tech/elon-musk-ai-your-job/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "business"}}

The suits, which accuse the companies of \u201cgrooming\u201d the Robb Elementary School shooter,\u00a0come after 19 families of students and teachers killed\u00a0at the school announced on Wednesday that\u00a0they settled a lawsuit with the city for $2 million. The companies \u2013 Meta, Activision\u00a0and Daniel Defense \u2013 all contributed to the behavior of\u00a0the\u00a0shooter\u00a0Salvador Ramos\u00a0in one way or another, the suits allege. Ramos\u00a0downloaded\u00a0the video game\u00a0\u201cCall of Duty: Modern Warfare\u201d in November 2021, according to the complaint filed in California against the publisher of the game, Activision, Meta, and others. The game featured a weapon from Daniel Defense called the DDM4 V7, which served as \u201ca teaser for players eager to try out the weapon,\u201d the suit alleges. At the same time, Ramos\u00a0\u201cwas being courted through explicit, aggressive marketing,\u201d on Instagram, the suit said. Meta\u00a0is the parent company of Instagram. \u201cIn addition to hundreds of images depicting and glorifying the thrill of combat, Daniel Defense used Instagram to extol the illegal, murderous use of its weapons,\u201d the suit said. \u201cWithin weeks of downloading Modern Warfare, the Shooter was browsing assault weapons, acquiring firearm attachments popularized by the game, and returning repeatedly to Daniel Defense\u2019s website.\u201d \u201cMere minutes after midnight on May 16\u2014the Shooter\u2019s 18th birthday\u2014he purchased a DDM4V7,\u201d the suit said. \u201cEight days later, the Shooter inflicted unspeakable violence at Robb Elementary School, killing 21 and injuring and traumatizing many more.\u201d Investigators in the Uvalde shooting found\u00a0one of Ramos\u2019 AR15-style rifles, manufactured by Daniel Defense, in the school,\u00a0according to then-Texas state Sen. John Whitmire, who is now the mayor of Houston. \u201cThe Defendants bear responsibility for this profound corruption of our children,\u201d the suit filed in California Superior Court in Los Angeles says. \u201cIn concert with certain firearm manufacturers, they have groomed a generation of young men who are socially vulnerable, insecure about their masculinity, and eager to show strength and assert dominance.\u201d According to the suit filed in Uvalde, Texas District Court, Daniel Defense\u00a0courts adolescents by harnessing and exploiting \u201cthe power of social media and first-person shooter simulations to lure teenagers to its website where it can monitor their online activity, build a profile of their interests, and solicit their contact information.\u201d In a statement,\u00a0Josh\u00a0Koskoff,\u00a0a\u00a0partner at\u00a0Koskoff,\u00a0Koskoff\u00a0& Bieder and\u00a0an\u00a0attorney for the families said:\u00a0\u201cThere is a direct line between the conduct of these companies and the Uvalde shooting.\u00a0Just 23 minutes after midnight on his 18th birthday, the Uvalde shooter bought an AR-15 made by a company with a market share of less than one percent. Why? Because, well before he was old enough to purchase it, he was targeted and cultivated online by Instagram, Activision and Daniel Defense. This three-headed monster knowingly exposed him to the weapon, conditioned him to see it as a tool to solve his problems and trained him to use it.\u201d A company spokesperson for Activision said in a statement to CNN Friday: \u201cThe Uvalde shooting was horrendous and heartbreaking in every way, and we express our deepest sympathies to the families and communities who remain impacted by this senseless act of violence. Millions of people around the world enjoy video games without turning to horrific acts.\u201d CNN has reached out to\u00a0Meta\u00a0and Daniel Defense for comment.

{"id": "2022_04_27_business_diamonds-manmade-demand", "text": "It\u2019s proposal season, and engagements are on the rise. So are factory-made diamond sales. Not that you\u2019d know the difference. Man-made diamonds look the same as naturally occurring ones. The only noticeable difference is the price tag. \u201cThe result is really stunning,\u201d said Edahn Golan, an independent diamond industry analyst. He said March data showed the number of engagement rings sold that featured a manufactured diamond jumped 63% compared to last year, while the number of engagement rings sold with a natural diamond declined 25% in the same period. Going back by another month, to February, the data showed the number of rings sold with lab diamonds that month surged even more, to 80% compared to a year earlier while the number fell by 13% for natural diamond engagement rings.  \u201cThe big fear in the natural diamonds industry is that consumers will start accepting lab-grown diamonds in engagement rings,\u201d he said. Too late. \u201cIt\u2019s actually happening.\u201d  Tide is shifting Why are consumers flocking to man-made diamonds? Cost is the most obvious reason. The average retail price of the most popular one carat round man-made diamond for an engagement ring in March was $2,318, Golan said. \u201cThis is substantially less \u2013 as much as 73% cheaper \u2013 than a natural diamond of the same size, cut and clarity as the man-made diamond, which would cost $8,740,\u201d he said. Plus, the lower cost allows couples to buy a bigger stone.  \u201cA lab diamond is a real diamond, but maybe it took a few weeks to make it,\u201d said Golan. \u201cNatural diamonds were formed over 800 million to three billion years and there isn\u2019t an infinite supply of them.\u201d  This makes natural diamonds quite a bit more expensive, and prices are likely to rise as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has tightened the supply chain for natural raw diamonds. The sanctions directly target Alrosa, partly owned by the Russian government, which the US government identified as the world\u2019s largest diamond mining company, accounting for 28% of global diamond output. Man-made diamonds are also becoming popular as consumers are more aware and educated about them, said Dan Moran, a third-generation diamond expert and owner of LA-based fine jeweler Concierge Diamonds. Moran said the typical buyer of man-made diamonds is typically younger than 40 and very budget conscious. Mined diamonds have a controversial history that\u2019s tied to the use of child labor in some African diamond mines as well as sales of illegally-traded \u201cconflict diamonds\u201d that fund conflict in war-torn areas. Among Millennials and Gen Z, their eco-conscious mindset and ethical concerns about natural diamond sourcing is another factor influencing their preference for non-traditional engagement rings, according to a report from wedding planning website The Knot. Small but growing share of the diamond market Although its slice is growing, the market share for man-made diamonds remains relatively small. Currently, about 7% of the specialty diamond jewelry market is represented by man-made diamonds, up from 3% in 2020, said Golan.  Some major jewelry retailers are driving the effort to take man-made diamonds mainstream. In 2021, the world\u2019s largest jewelry company, Pandora\n            \n                (PANDY), made a major shift by announcing it would stop using mined diamonds and would swap to lab-created diamonds in its jewelry.  Pandora said it\u2019s instituting the change as part of an effort to sell sustainable jewelry, and also because consumers increasingly are asking for it. Signet,\n            \n                (SIG) the largest jewelry company in the United States (which owns Zales, Kay Jewelers and Jared chains) called out the popularity of lab diamond jewelry in its March earnings call with analysts. Calling it a \u201cfast-growing category\u201d in its jewelry portfolio, Signet CEO Virginia Drosos told analysts that lab-created diamonds are among the big jewelry trends she expects this year.  The company said it has expanded its man-made bridal jewelry selection in both its Zales and Kay Jewelers stores in response to the increased demand.  Fine jewelry brand Charles and Colvard, which makes lab-created diamonds, said consumers don\u2019t just want to look good with the jewelry they are wearing, they also want to feel good about it. \u201cAs the momentum for conscious consumerism grows, the surge towards lab grown diamonds isn\u2019t surprising,\u201d said Don O\u2019Connell, president and CEO of Charles & Colvard. \u201c[Consumers] want to know the origins of their stones and be reassured they\u2019re conflict-free. They\u2019re embracing the choice to purchase a piece of fine jewelry that aligns with their values.\u201d Lab-grown diamond brand VRAI said the pandemic, too, has sparked attention and action toward social and environmental issues. It said consumers are being more thoughtful and reassessing their purchasing habits, as well as the companies and industries they are supporting. There is, however, one important consideration for anyone buying lab-created diamonds: Man-made diamonds have little resale value.  So while you may not be able to tell a natural diamond from a factory made variety, someone with a trained eye can, said Golan. Once a stone is identified as a factory diamond, even though you paid a lot less for it, you also won\u2019t get much for it.  But the value of a ring isn\u2019t just monetary. \u201cAs a professional in the industry, I am asked all the time by people about what I think about a ring they have,\u201d said Moran, of Concierge Jewelers. \u201cI always say, if you love it, be happy with it. An engagement ring is a symbol of commitment and enduring love.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/27/business/diamonds-manmade-demand/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_01_tech_aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl", "text": "A London-based technology company is looking to \u201cdemocratize\u201d talent-identification and scouting in soccer using a mobile app. Free to download and available globally, the aiScout app allows aspiring soccer stars to enter virtual trials for professional clubs by uploading self-recorded footage of themselves completing a series of drills. It offers 75 exercises, designed to test a range of skills, with videos showing users how to complete them. Performances are automatically scored by artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The data can then be accessed by clubs, allowing their scouts to peruse scores for viable talent, honing their search with a variety of filters; from age and gender to position on the pitch. The app currently has two English Premier League (EPL) partners, Chelsea and Burnley, and clubs can tailor their in-app trials to meet specific needs and set their own benchmarks by having their academy players complete the same drills. \u201cWe\u2019re putting that data up front to make better use of [the scouts\u2019] time,\u201d said Richard Felton-Thomas, chief operating officer of ai.io, the company behind the app. \u201cTo say [to scouts], \u2018Go over to this place today because there\u2019s three players in that game that are all actually beating your Chelsea standard\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s going to be the best use of your time.\u2019\u201d It already appears to be working for some. Ben Greenwood had never had a trial with a professional club until he downloaded the app in 2019. After uploading footage of himself, the 17-year-old landed a trial with Chelsea, becoming the first user of the app to get a trial with a pro club. He signed a contract\u00a0with EPL team Bournemouth\u00a0in 2021. \u2018It\u2019s more about evolution\u2019 Having beta-tested in with players spanning 125 countries, Greenwood among them, 135 players have been trialed or signed by pro clubs or national teams through the app \u2014 which fully launched in September 2023 \u2014 according to Felton-Thomas. Just over 100,000 players make up the current database, but with over 100 clubs lined up to join Chelsea and Burnley, as well as a multi-year partnership with Major League Soccer in the US announced last May, Felton-Thomas projects user numbers to surge into the millions as the operation ramps up this year. Felton-Thomas said the \u201clion\u2019s share\u201d of its income comes from charging clubs a license fee to run the platform. Annual fees vary depending on the size of the club and the tools they require, ranging from six figures for \u201ctier one\u201d sides like Chelsea, to thousands of pounds for clubs lower down the footballing pyramid. The use of smart technology in sport continues to expand, including\u00a0AI commentary tools and wearable tech for elite athletes. The global market for sports analytics, valued at\u00a0$2.7 billion\u00a0in 2023, is projected to grow 22% by the end of the decade, according to market research firm Grand View Research. Should soccer talent scouts be concerned about being edged out by the arrival of AI in their industry? For Felton-Thomas, new technologies can co-exist with traditional methods. \u201cIt\u2019s more about evolution than revolution,\u201d Felton-Thomas explained. \u201cWe can\u2019t tell you when that player\u2019s actually in that match, how does he deal with adversity? What happens when he\u2019s 2-0 down? What happens when someone\u2019s shouting at him? What happens when he\u2019s just made a massive mistake?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got the ability to just augment real people to do their jobs better and faster, which then gives an opportunity to the player through the AI, but you\u2019re still actually just connecting them to the human on the other side, which is the club and the scout.\u201d While football remains ai.io\u2019s primary focus, the company is looking into opportunities in other sports to launch in the coming years. Further ahead, it may branch out beyond sports. \u201cYou think about the notion that you can be at home and analyze your movements, and how this could spin into health care, physical assessments for military disciplines and emergency services,\u201d Felton-Thomas told CNN.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/01/tech/aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_27_media_nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over", "text": "Only 80 hours elapsed between NBC News announcing Ronna McDaniel as a paid contributor and the network ousting her from that very role. But for the leadership at NBC Universal News Group, those were 80\u00a0painful hours. On Tuesday evening, following another full day in which the media rumor mill churned at warp speed, NBCU News Group boss Cesar Conde sent staff a memo, notifying his troops that he had reversed his decision to welcome the former Republican National Committee chair to \u201cthe team.\u201d \u201cAfter listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor,\u201d Conde said, adding that he wanted to \u201cpersonally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down.\u201d Conde had no real choice. The embattled NBCU boss, who I\u2019m told dealt with the crisis from an unknown location outside of 30 Rock, was facing an unprecedented rebellion from his most high-profile stars, who one by one went on the air and excoriated leadership\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel. The only aspect of Conde\u2019s note that was surprising was the fact that it came 48 hours late, allowing what started off as a crisis to fester and balloon into one of the worst corporate public relations calamities in recent memory. \u201cWhat a sh*t show!\u201d a media executive exclaimed to me Tuesday shortly after Conde relieved McDaniel of her NBC News credentials. In his note, Conde said he took \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for McDaniel\u2019s hire. But, he also did point the finger, telling staffers that hiring her was \u201ca collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team.\u201d Indeed, multiple people familiar with the matter have told me that the infighting among NBC executives over who was at fault for the disaster has reached a fever pitch, with various factions of the NBCU News Group assigning blame to others. Regardless of who is to blame, the entire affair made clear who is actually in control of the company \u2014 and it\u2019s not Conde & Co. Despite the NBCU C-suite digging their heels in the sand as they resisted dumping McDaniel for days, they were ultimately forced to succumb to pressure from their talent. As a second media executive commented to me, it is now \u201cvery clear who is in charge\u201d after the \u201cweak leadership was put on full display.\u201d \u201cHas Cesar lost the room?\u201d wondered a third media executive. While the Peacock family argues over who was really at fault, the company is facing a fresh public relations mess. Led by Donald Trump, right-wing personalities are already assailing the network as being overrun with intolerant woke leftists. \u201cThese Radical Left Lunatics are CRAZY and the top people at NBC ARE WEAK,\u201d Trump raged on his Truth Social platform. Ari Fleischer, who served as press secretary under President George W. Bush, wrote on X: \u201cWhat NBC is saying is if you\u2019re for Trump, you don\u2019t belong. Good. Let NBC be for Democrats only.\u201d Of course, that narrative is intellectually dishonest. The objection to McDaniel from both within and outside of NBCU was not that she is a Republican. It wasn\u2019t even that she was a Trump-supporting Republican. No, the objection stemmed from the fact that McDaniel was an active participant in the plot to subvert the 2020 vote. And, in addition to that disgraceful history, she had a lengthy track record smearing NBC News and MSNBC. Nevertheless, NBCU will now have to contend with such dishonest attacks being leveled by the right, which will follow them in the days, months, and even years to come. As unfair as it may be, they will certainly damage the network\u2019s brand in Republican circles \u2014 a place it had gone through great pains to appeal to. NBCU will also have to grapple with McDaniel, who spent the last 24 hours or so interviewing lawyers as she gears up for a possible legal fight with the network, according to a person familiar with the matter. The rift between McDaniel and NBCU had grown to such an extent by Tuesday that she was not informed by network brass that she had been dismissed, I\u2019m told. Instead, McDaniel learned of her ouster in press reports. While NBCU is being beaten up on the right, the company\u2019s leadership was quickly praised by its journalists and top stars. Shortly after Conde sent out his memo, Rachel Maddow appeared on Joy Reid\u2019s show, where the two lauded Conde for reversing course. \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/27/media/nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "business"}}

Specifically, 485,000 of them. That\u2019s up 15% from the 422,000 accounts reported at the end of 2023 and 43% higher than a year ago. Fidelity is one of the largest providers of workplace retirement plans, and its 401(k) data is based on more than 23 million plan participants. The record number of million-dollar-plus accounts was first reported by Bloomberg. The average balance for the so-called 401(k) \u201cmillionaires\u201d came to $1,580,000, up from $1,551,300 in the fourth quarter, a Fidelity spokesperson said. There is no secret sauce for how a 401(k) participant can accumulate that kind of balance \u2014 or any kind of substantial balance for that matter. While market returns are key, even more essential is the amount one saves over time. The average 401(k) participant with a balance over $1 million, according to Fidelity, has been saving for 26 years and contributes 17% of their income, which includes any matches they receive from their employer. Other 401(k) participants also saw increases in their balances in the first quarter. \u201cRecord-high contribution levels coupled with positive market conditions pushed average account balances to their highest levels since the fourth quarter of 2021,\u201d Fidelity said. \u201cLong-term savers observed the greatest improvement, which is good news, especially for the more than 4.9 million workers that have been in their 401(k) plan for five years or more.\u201d The average balance rose to $125,900, up 16% from a year ago. The average savings rate hit a record 14.2%, including employer matches, and is very close to the recommended 15% savings rate from Fidelity and retirement savings experts. Among Gen Xers, who are next on deck to retire behind the Baby Boomers, those that have been saving continuously for 15 years had an average balance of $543,400, just a smidge higher than the $543,200 Baby Boomers in that category had saved over the same period. Meanwhile, the number of 401(k) participants who had borrowed against their savings and still had a loan outstanding in the first quarter held steady relative to the fourth quarter at 17.8%, but that is up from 16.7% a year earlier. Retirement readiness in the United States is an issue for a majority of workers, including the millions of employees who don\u2019t have access to a workplace savings plan or who don\u2019t participate if they do.

It is discounting thousands of grocery items in a bid to entice price-conscious shoppers to add a little bit more to their shopping carts. The online grocery delivery service, which also operates a handful of physical stores, said its shoppers in the United States will see discounts every day of up to 30% on 4,000 items in-store and online, and those markdowns will rotate weekly. A number of big retailers in recent weeks, including Target and Walmart, have lowered their prices as they strive to pull consumers into stores and online to spend more freely on both essential purchases such as food and more discretionary purchases like new clothes, decorative items for the home, arts and\u00a0crafts or hobby kits. Retailers are feeling jittery after they jacked up prices as inflation spiked in recent years. But now, households aren\u2019t shopping like they used to, and high prices are forcing Americans to choose between wants and needs. In the game of chicken between stores and shoppers, it\u2019s the stores that finally appear to be yielding. That\u2019s a problem not just for individual shoppers or even big retail chains but for the whole American economy, of which about two-thirds comes from consumer spending. Shoppers have pulled back for a year now as costs have risen 20% to 30% higher than they were three years ago and as incomes failed to keep up, said Sarah Wyeth, managing director, retail and consumer with S&P Global Ratings. This is making consumers across income levels look for deals. \u201cThere\u2019s just less dollars for consumers to spend,\u201d Wyeth said. The challenge for retailers now is to shake consumers out of that frugal mindset, she added. What\u2019s getting cheaper on Amazon Fresh The price cuts include meat, seafood, frozen food, dairy and cheese, beverages, snacks and pastas, the retailer told CNN Friday. The discounted food items will include national brands and Amazon\u2019s (AMZN) private label products. \u201cIncreasing our weekly deals across thousands of items and expanding the reach of Prime Savings at Amazon Fresh is just one way that we\u2019re continuing to invest in competitive pricing and savings for all of our customers \u2013 both in-store and online,\u201d Claire Peters, worldwide vice president with Amazon Fresh, said in a statement.

Also, all three retailers reported their quarterly sales this month and it wasn\u2019t a pretty picture for the industry Goliaths. Home Depot\u2019s same-store sales (or sales at stores open at least a year) in the US fell 3.2% in its latest quarter both as shoppers pulled back on remodels and renovations and also on discretionary decorative-type purchases to spruce up their homes. Home Depot\u2019s stock price is down 5% so far in 2024. Lowe\u2019s sales at stores open at least a year fell a steep 4.1% in its latest quarter for similar reasons. Lowe\u2019s stock price has dipped 7% in the past month.  \u201cThe danger here is that while Home Depot has a commanding position, it faces much more competition on the light-side improvement space from smaller improvement players, garden centers, and specialists like Sherwin Williams in categories like paint,\u201d Neil Saunders, retail analyst and managing director at Globaldata Retail, wrote in a note last week. \u201cConsumers are now shopping around more to find the best bargains and deals,\u201d he said. These trends appear to be working in Ace Hardware\u2019s favor. The hardware chain saw a small increase in its US same-store sales in its most recent quarter and a 1.1% increase in the average amount people spent per store trip. Total revenue for the company systemwide rose 2.5% in the period from a year ago. It expects to open 200 new stores in 2024. Small and mighty stores Ace Hardware\u2019s store setup \u2014 smaller-sized shops of 7,000 to 10,000 square feet on average \u2014 situated within communities and selling much more than just nuts, bolts and paint are resonating with the evolving shopping psyche of today\u2019s rushed consumers, industry watchers said. Each store carries about 25,000 to 30,000 unique products. \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting phenomenon,\u201d said Michael Brown, partner in consulting firm Kearney\u2019s\u00a0consumer products and retail practice. \u201cAce is your local customized, intimate hardware store where I can go in, get something very quickly, talk to people that I know. It\u2019s also close to home and I can easily meet my small project needs,\u201d he said. Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s, by contrast, cater to the contractor or the homeowner doing big remodeling work. And while bigger home renovation projects have slowed in recent months, those larger hardware stores have suffered sales declines. Ace, meanwhile, benefits as people turn to smaller fix-it projects, he said. \u201cThey\u2019re positioned quite well now geographically to service the needs of the consumer today,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve build a unique niche and their stores are also bringing a local flavor to them.\u201d Barker is owner and operator of five Breed & Co Ace Hardware locations in the Austin, Texas, area. The West Lake Hills store, in particular, is popular with women. While the store stocks typical hardware needs such as screws, drill bits and hammers, Barker goes to great lengths to offer the unexpected. \u201cI like to call it a boutique atmosphere,\u201d she said. She said upper-income customers have expectations of better service. \u201cIf you want to continue to have that consistent repeat business you got to give them what they want.\u201d In addition to hardware and garden products, the housewares section offers a wedding registry. \u201cIt\u2019s a very unique proposition because we don\u2019t have a lot of competition in terms of local, relevant and differentiated retailing here,\u201d Barker said. The registry idea arose from a local need. \u201cWe noticed that a lot of brides don\u2019t necessarily want to get what Aunt May buys for them,\u201d she said. Engaged couples, she said, sometimes prefer picking items such as a grill or plants. So we\u2019ve really beefed up that side of the business to stay relevant to our customers.\u201d Jewelry is a top seller, too, as are pricey Le Crueset pots and pans, Nest candles, baby products such as plush toys, baby onesie pajamas and truffle chocolates. \u201cWe sell a ton of Le Crueset. It\u2019s one of our top performers,\u201d Barker said. \u201cMany of our customers are grandparents going to a baby shower and they need a gift. We count on people coming in everyday to buy a gift item from us.\u201d This hybrid hardware-home goods-curio model is setting Ace Hardware stores apart. \u201cConsumers are looking for new places to shop,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost places like Bed Bath & Beyond and Linens \u2018n Things, where you go to buy a curtain rod or smaller home needs. Ace is nicely filling that void.\u201d A retail cooperative Ace Hardware, with its catchy jingle \u201cAce is the place with the helpful hardware folks,\u201d was founded in 1924 by a group of four Chicago hardware store owners. It operates a unique structure in which only 4% of its more than 6,000 worldwide stores are company owned. The retailer, instead runs as a retail-owned cooperative, which means individual store operators are also part owners, making them independent entrepreneurs. \u201cThey are essentially shareholders, they own the brand and the company,\u201d said Kim Lefko, chief marketing officer of Ace Hardware. Individual store owners, who make up more than 90% of the business, select products in two ways: They can order and stock national brands and private label products in bulk at a lower price directly from Ace Hardware\u2019s warehouses. They also have the flexibility to curate about 20% of the merchandise mix to suit local tastes and needs by ordering directly from other vendors, Lefko said. \u201cDuring the post World War I era, the four business owners much like today wanted to be competitive in the marketplace. They got together and the very first product they bought was a truckload of sponges so they could be price competitive,\u201d said Lefko. \u201cThis really is the co-op structure. It keeps us competitive against the like of Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s, together with the ability to also tailor the products to what the local community needs.\u201d But all stores are still unified under Ace\u2019s national marketing and advertising effort, she said. Ace is pushing innovation with the brand, too. It just launched its first Ace-branded food product, a line of BBQ sauces, and a collection of Ace Hardware vintage-inspired clothing. Legendary NFL coach and broadcaster John Madden served as a pitchman for Ace Hardware for more than 20 years while his NFL broadcast partner Pat Summerall was a pitchman for rival hardware chain, True Value. In many of the same neighborhoods, Ace Hardware has gone head-to-head with True Value, which operated a similar model to Ace for many years, a cooperative partly owned by its roughly 4,000 store owners. Private equity firm Acon Investments purchased True Value in 2018 and ended its time as cooperative retail chain. Michael Wynn, owner of Sunshine Ace Hardware with 12 locations in the Southern Florida area, is catering to a different demographic in his community \u2013- fishermen. Among the locally curated products he stocks next to plumbing, electrical supplies and hardware are fishing gear \u2014 reels, rods, tackles and Yeti coolers. \u201cWe have the largest assortment in southwest Florida,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we also sell homemade fudge and Vera Bradley bags and pouches.\u201d \u201cPeople are time starved. They want quick and convenient shopping experience and we\u2019re trying to give them that,\u201d Wynn said, whose grandfather founded the first Sunshine Ace in 1958. So he added a drive-thru window in one of his newer stores. He\u2019s glad he did. He said a customer recently pulled up to pick up an order but his child was agitated and made it difficult for the man to come into the store. \u201cSo he requested that the store clerk bring the order to him,\u201d said Wynn. \u201cThis for me is a big part of why we try to offer unique services and look out for our customers.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/business/ace-hardware-staying-power/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_03_19_success_wall-street-bonuses", "text": "Last year wasn\u2019t the most lucrative for Wall Street bankers, but their bonus payouts still easily trounced US median household income. The average Wall Street bonus for 2023 was $176,500, according to estimates that will be released Tuesday morning by New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli. That\u2019s down 2% from the $180,000 recorded in 2022. Both those averages were well below the $240,000 paid out in 2021. That the average bonus was slightly down isn\u2019t surprising. Wall Street earnings last year were mixed, and merger and acquisition activity was underwhelming. \u201cWall Street\u2019s profits were up 1.8% in 2023, but firms have taken a more cautious approach to compensation and more employees have joined the securities industry, which accounts for the slight decline in the average bonus,\u201d DiNapoli said in a statement. Nevertheless, a little perspective: The average Wall Street bonus, which comes on top of the nearly half-a-million-dollar average Wall Street salary, was itself almost 2.5 times higher than the median US household income of $74,580, according to Census data for 2022. Wall Street bonuses and general employment in the securities industry provide vital revenue streams for the New York State and New York City economies, accounting most recently for 27% of the state\u2019s tax collections and 7% of city tax revenue, according to DiNapoli\u2019s office. The securities industry \ufeffin the city employed roughly 198,500 people last year, up from 191,600 the year before. And DiNapoli estimates that 1 in 11 of the city\u2019s jobs are either directly or indirectly associated with the industry. The total estimated bonus pool for 2023 was\u00a0slightly lower than the year before and is\u00a0projected to bring in $4 million less in state income tax revenue and $2 million less for the city revenue than bonuses in 2022 did. Still, DiNapoli noted, \u201cWhile these bonuses affect income tax revenues for the state and city, both budgeted for larger declines so the impact on projected revenues should be limited.\u201d It should be noted that the comptroller\u2019s numbers only reflect the bonuses paid to securities industry employees working for firms based in New York City. Beyond bringing in tax revenue for government coffers, Wall Street workers contribute substantially to the local Gotham economy. DiNapoli said that more employees in financial services (65%) are working in-office on any given day compared to 58% working in other industries in the city, at least as of September 2023. And that securities industry employees use the subway more than other workers in the city. All in, he estimates that Wall Street is responsible for roughly 14% of economic activity in the city. As critical as that is, the city and state are about much more than just Wall Street. \u201cThe securities industry\u2019s continued strength should not overshadow the broader economic picture in New York, where we need all sectors to enjoy full recovery from the pandemic,\u201d DiNapoli said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/19/success/wall-street-bonuses/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_21_economy_economic-wellbeing-2023-inflation", "text": "Inflation may have slowed last year, but it continued to deal heavy blows \u2014 some devastating \u2014 on Americans\u2019 livelihoods: Nearly two-thirds of US adults were worse off because of it, and roughly 1 in 6 couldn\u2019t pay all their monthly bills, new Federal Reserve data shows. The Fed on Tuesday released its Economic Well-Being of US Households report for 2023, examining the financial lives of US adults and their families. The report found that 72% of adults surveyed said they were \u201cdoing okay\u201d financially. That\u2019s a tick lower than last year but well below the high of 78% hit in 2021 (and still above the record low of 62% in 2013). Inflation made the financial lives \u201cworse\u201d for 65% of US households, according to the report. Among those, 19% said it was \u201cmuch worse.\u201d The findings were drawn from the Fed\u2019s 11th annual Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking, which looks at American\u2019s economic health across a variety of areas, including employment, income, banking and credit, housing, retirement planning, student loans, childcare and even Buy Now, Pay Later usage. But even in a time when broad economic data highlights a remarkably resilient economy \u2014 job growth has been stellar and pay gains have been strong, which have helped fuel spending and keep the economy rolling \u2014 not everyone feels that upbeat. Three-plus years of high inflation have taken their toll on Americans\u2019 wallets and their psyches. Skipping meals, medical care That was especially true in 2022, when US inflation hit 9.1%, its highest annual rate in more than 40 years. As of last month, annual inflation was 3.4%, according to the Consumer Price Index. Incomes grew healthily in 2023, but so did spending, the Fed report showed. Monthly budgets remained tight and more than half of adults didn\u2019t have money left over after paying their expenses. This was especially true for lower-income adults, who reported higher instances of not having enough to eat, not being able to cover bills in full and skipping medical care. Overall, 17% of adults reported they could not pay all their bills in full in the month prior to the survey, which was conducted in October 2023. \u201cThe [Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking] provides valuable insight into the financial conditions of American households,\u201d Fed Governor Michelle Bowman said in a release accompanying the report. \u201cThis perspective continues to help the Federal Reserve better understand how families are coping with the ongoing economic challenges they face.\u201d Perspectives on local, national economy The report showed improvement in people\u2019s feelings about how their local economy fared \u2014 with 42% saying it was \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cexcellent,\u201d versus 38% the year before. However, that share is a far cry from how people felt pre-pandemic: In 2019, 63% felt their local economy was in good or excellent health. Zooming out to the national economy, it was a similar story: People\u2019s perceptions improved from 2022 (22% last year, up from 18%), but they remain well below the 50% share notched in 2019. Tuesday\u2019s report showed similar measures of financial resiliency to what was reported in 2022, with 63% of adults saying they\u2019d be able to cover a $400 emergency expense with cash on hand. While that share is below the recent high of 68% hit in 2021, it\u2019s well above what was seen during the past decade. In 2013, only 50% said they could pay for a $400 emergency expense with cash, Fed data shows. Child care expenses eat up budgets While the financial well-being was generally unchanged from 2022 for most Americans, Fed researchers highlighted one particular segment that saw a signifcant downward swing: Parents living with children under the age of 18. The share of respondents from that group who said they were \u201cdoing okay\u201d fell to 64% from 69% in 2022 and from 75% in 2021. For those with younger children, child care expenses were considerable in 2023. Paid child care expenses amounted to 50% to 70% of what parents shelled out for their monthly housing payment, according to the report. Child care expenses, along with homeowners\u2019 insurance, food sufficiency and caregiving responsibilities, were among the new topics discussed in the report. In terms of homeowners\u2019 insurance, the report found that adults who have a higher risk of being financially affected by a natural disaster were less likely to be insured. Nearly 25% of homeowners who live in the South and make under $50,000 a year did not have homeowners\u2019 insurance, the Fed found.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/economy/economic-wellbeing-2023-inflation/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_business_ticket-master-live-nation-taylor-swift", "text": "In our divided nation, it\u2019s a comfort to know that there are still issues that unite more than they divide. Like, ice cream, or Caitlin Clark, or the urge to publicly shame the person who wasn\u2019t prepared to take off their shoes in the airport security line. On Thursday, the government\u2019s complaint against Live Nation reminded us of one of those things every warm-blooded American knows in their bones: that buying tickets to a major concert or sporting event sucks. Like, so much so it might actually be illegal. The blame, according to the Justice Department, lies squarely with the corporate behemoth that dominates the live entertainment industry \u2014 Live Nation, along with its wholly owned subsidiary, Ticketmaster, which prosecutors say has abused its power to stifle competition, force fans to pay more, and bully artists and venues into using its services. \u201cRather than investing in better products and services, we allege that Live Nation has illegally monopolized markets across the live concert industry in the United States for far too long,\u201d Attorney General Merrick Garland said at a news conference Thursday. \u201cIt is time to break it up.\u201d It is difficult to overstate just how thoroughly Live Nation, which acquired Ticketmaster more than a decade ago, controls live entertainment in America. Per the DOJ complaint: No rival even comes close. There\u2019s a fine line between vertical integration and all-out monopoly, and Live Nation is, at minimum, very clearly toeing it. One nation, under Swift To be sure, none of this is new. Artists, fans and venues have been complaining about Live Nation and Ticketmaster pretty much since they agreed to merge in 2009. But it was the awesome rage of the Swifties that finally shook the halls of Congress and got some bipartisan momentum building for federal intervention. ICYMI: Two years ago, Ticketmaster made an absolute hash of ticket sales for Taylor Swift\u2019s Eras Tour. The Senate hauled Live Nation\u2019s president and CFO in for questioning and scolding. At one point, Sen. Richard Blumenthal congratulated the executive for a \u201cstunning achievement\u201d of bringing together Republicans and Democrats in \u201can absolutely unified cause.\u201d Cut to 2024, the Eras Tour is the highest-grossing tour of all time and the federal antimonopoly case against Live Nation has begun. Garland, a noted Swiftie himself, announced the complaint Thursday, saying \u201cwe are not here today because Live Nation-Ticketmaster\u2019s conduct is inconvenient, or frustrating. We are here because \u2026 that conduct is anti-competitive and illegal.\u201d Anti-competitive tactics In its lawsuit, the DOJ takes issue with a bunch of Live Nation\u2019s tactics, but the two big ones to know about are 1) the company\u2019s exclusive contracts with venues and 2) its strong-arming of would-be competitors. Basically, if you own a venue and choose to work with another promoter or ticketing service besides Live Nation-Ticketmaster, the DOJ claims, you risk serious financial retaliation. \u201cLive Nation does not have to threaten individual venues explicitly (although it does) to discourage them from signing ticketing contracts with competitors,\u201d the DOJ complaint reads. \u201cThe risks are well known in the industry.\u201d In a statement, Live Nation called the DOJ\u2019s allegations \u201cbaseless,\u201d adding that the lawsuit \u201cwon\u2019t solve the issues fans care about relating to ticket prices, service fees, and access to in-demand shows.\u201d Adam Wolfson, an antitrust lawyer with the firm Quinn Emanuel, said the DOJ\u2019s requests for relief hit at the heart of Live Nation\u2019s dominance in ticketing and promotions \u2014 specifically, the long-term exclusive deals with venues. If the government can disrupt those deals, it could be a crowbar that lets much smaller rivals like SeatGeek and Eventbrite get a foot in the door. But don\u2019t expect the ticket-buying process to get better anytime soon. Live Nation, Wolfson said, is likely to come out swinging. \u201cI would expect to see a motion to dismiss is the next phase, which then leads to briefing back and forth over a period of months \u2026 we\u2019re talking easily a year, two, maybe three years\u201d before there\u2019s a ruling.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/business/ticket-master-live-nation-taylor-swift/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_business_a-popular-memorial-day-tradition-is-back-hot-deals-on-new-cars", "text": "Memorial Day weekend is shaping up to offer some of the best deals on new cars in years. The discounts vary widely by manufacturer and type of car \u2013 don\u2019t expect too much off on a Toyota SUV, for example. But it\u2019s a good time to be in the market for an electric vehicle. The new car market is finally a buyer\u2019s market again. For decades, the holiday weekend was a great time to buy a new car, with dealers competing to sell out the last of the previous year\u2019s models to make room for incoming new cars. It hasn\u2019t been that way for a while, though. Covid lockdowns disrupted parts supply chains for car factories, making new models often hard to find. It got so bad that, for a while,  almost all cars were routinely selling for above the manufacturers suggested retail price, or MSRP, something that\u2019s normally rare. Deep discounts? They were practically unheard of. Not this year. The auto industry is back pumping out new cars, and dealers are discounting again. Currently Ford dealers are offering average incentives of up to $1,556 on the Ford Bronco, more than six times what they were offering last year, according to data from Cox Automotive. On the GMC Sierra pickup, dealers are offering almost $6,000 on average in incentives, according to Cox. EVs are good buys right now. The Volkswagen ID.4 and Kia Niro EV, for instance, are selling at average discounts of more than 13%, according to Edmunds.com. Zero-percent financing deals for buyers with good credit have also become much more common this year than last, according to Edmunds.com. \u201cA lot more inventory\u2019s out there now,\u201d said Eric Barbosa, business leader for the Cavender Auto Group in San Antonio, Texas. \u201cI mean, we\u2019ve got to get rid of these cars.\u201d Making room for the 2025 models It\u2019s not just seasonal sales hype, industry experts say. Dealers really are negotiating deeper discounts than they have in the last few years because they need the space. Overall, new vehicle inventory at dealers is the highest it\u2019s been since late in 2020, according to Cox Automotive. The average discount on a 2023 model year vehicle these days is $4,127, according to Edmunds, which is much deeper than discounts on leftover prior-year models for the last few years. Newer 2024 model year vehicles are selling at an average discount of $1,741. \u201cThere\u2019s a big push to get these \u201923s out and make room for the \u201824s and \u201825s,\u201d said Barbosa. There are more of these prior-year models, meaning 2023 model year vehicles, left than there were this time last year. Vehicles from the outgoing 2023 model year now account for 6.8% of all new vehicles on dealers\u2019 lots, according to Edmunds.com. That\u2019s higher than the percentage of 2022 model year vehicles available around this time last year, and it\u2019s much higher than the 3.7% that were 2021 model year vehicles left for sale this late in 2022. Where are the biggest deals and risks? Bulging vehicle inventories are not evenly distributed, though. Dealerships for some manufacturers have many more unsold vehicles than others. Dealers for Stellantis brands \u2013 Dodge, Chrysler, Jeep and Ram \u2013 are offering the biggest discounts, according to Edmunds.com. These brands are usually sold together in combined dealerships. Dodge is offering some of the biggest discounts in the industry, averaging more than $6,700 per vehicle, according to Edmunds. Chrysler vehicles are selling for an average discount of more than $6,200, while Jeeps are selling at an average of $6,000 off sticker price. Since these figures are averages, that means that not every model in every place will be discounted that much, of course, while some will be discounted more. Here\u2019s one big caveat. A model year may seem like just a number, but shoppers should research carefully to make sure that last year\u2019s model isn\u2019t missing features and improvements introduced on the 2024 version. For example, if you\u2019re considering the Lincoln Nautilus SUV, the 2024 model is entirely redesigned with lots of improvements including a big interior screen and customizable \u201cdigital scenting\u201d to make the cabin smell nice. Also, when it comes time to trade in, the 2023 could be worth less than a 2024 model. \u201cConsumers who prefer to swap their vehicles every few years may want to look elsewhere as these new outgoing models experience heavier immediate depreciation compared to new vehicles from the current model year,\u201d said Edmunds industry analyst Ivan Drury in an email. And not all dealers are offering exciting sales. \u201cToyota, Honda and Kia, there is still so much pent-up demand for these brands, inventory is tight, and sell-through rates are high,\u201d said Brian Finkelmeyer, an industry analyst with Cox Automotive. So you\u2019re unlikely to find big discounts on those vehicles. It will also depend on the type of vehicle you\u2019re looking for, experts say. \u201cThe deals are likely to be had on slower-selling models, specifically sedans and hatchbacks,\u201d said Brian Moody, an industry analyst with Autotrader and Kelley Blue Book. \u201cWith compact SUVs selling in higher and higher volumes each year, don\u2019t bother.\u00a0You will likely be paying full sticker price.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/business/a-popular-memorial-day-tradition-is-back-hot-deals-on-new-cars/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "business"}}

According to CEO and founder Rob Sims, digital humans can help bridge the gap between AI technology and people. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve found is when people start working with and conversing with a digital human, they very quickly suspend disbelief,\u201d Sims tells CNN. \u201cIt becomes natural.\u201d AI explosion Since OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT was launched in November 2022, considerable hype has surrounded the potential of generative AI \u2014 artificial intelligence powered by huge datasets of information, capable of generating text outputs in a conversational way. Record levels of investment into generative AI have followed, with over $21 billion poured into the industry during the first nine months of last year, according to data insights company Pitchbook. In March 2023, Google launched Bard (recently renamed Gemini) and around the same time Anthropic released its AI assistant Claude. As generative AI chatbots become increasingly ubiquitous, Sum Vivas is one of several companies looking to make them more human. US and New Zealand-based UneeQ has developed animated conversational \u201cdigital humans\u201d that can be used as virtual sales reps and customer service agents on company websites, and this month it debuted Sama 2.0, an animated cabin crew member that answers questions on Qatar Airways\u2019 website and app. Microsoft recently announced that users of its Azure software would be able to create lifelike avatars capable of turning text prompts into animated speech. However, there are widespread concerns about the impact AI could have on the job market.  \u201cWhen we rely on automated tools, what skills are we losing in the process?\u201d asks Jennifer Ding, senior researcher at the Alan Turing Institute, the UK\u2019s national institute for data science and artificial intelligence. \u201cIn some ways, we think of AI as something that\u2019s helping us or augmenting our work,\u201d she says. \u201cHowever, alongside, this fear of replacement is bubbling up more and more.\u201d Harris, however, points to new opportunities within digital human design and development. \u201cEvery scenario that we found, we\u2019re creating jobs and working in harmony with people rather than taking away jobs,\u201d she says. \u201cDigital humans, first and foremost, should work with other human colleagues,\u201d adds Sims. \u201cWe\u2019ll move into a stage where digital humans will start to become just another member of the team, with added benefits for that team, and obviously the customers they serve.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/business/digital-humans-ai-dj-dex-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "business"}}

The probe is yet another complication for the social media platform, which is already facing the threat of a potential US ban or a forced divestment from its Chinese parent company. The sources said that the FTC is probing TikTok over an alleged violation of the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection rule, which requires companies to notify parents and obtain consent before collecting data from children under 13. The agency is also investigating whether TikTok violated a portion of the FTC Act that prohibits \u201cunfair or deceptive\u201d business practices, the sources said, in denying that TikTok user data could be accessed by individuals in China. The FTC could bring a suit against TikTok or settle with the company in the coming weeks, according to one of the sources. Politico reported news of the probe earlier. When asked about the investigation, FTC Director of Public Affairs Douglas Farrar replied: \u201cNo comment.\u201d TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The FTC probe comes as TikTok faces an existential threat in the US. Earlier this month, a bipartisan group in the US House of Representatives voted to pass a law forcing TikTok to be sold by ByteDance or face a ban from US app stores. The bill is now before the Senate, and President Joe Biden has said he would sign it if it gets to his desk. Senate leaders, however, have indicated they are taking a deliberate approach \u2014\u00a0which could lead to delays or even potentially doom the House bill. The short-form video company, owned by Chinese firm ByteDance, has denied assertions that its app poses a national security threat to US citizens. TikTok, which does not operate in China, has said that the Chinese government has never accessed US user data. Cybersecurity experts say Chinese laws require ByteDance to cooperate with that country\u2019s intelligence demands\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a fact that, given ByteDance\u2019s ownership of TikTok, could hypothetically put US user data at risk. To address that issue, TikTok has taken steps to store its US user data on cloud servers controlled by US tech giant Oracle and established internal protocols limiting access by non-US employees. TikTok acknowledged to Congress in 2022 that employees based in China could access US user data, following a report that year by BuzzFeed News that ByteDance employees had accessed that information on multiple occasions. TikTok CEO Shou Chew, in his first appearance before Congress last year, also acknowledged that several ByteDance employees were fired for spying on certain US journalists as part of a \u201cmisguided attempt\u201d to hunt down leakers within the company.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/ftc-tiktok-probe-privacy-and-security/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_media_newsmax-smartmatic-defamation-case", "text": "The right-wing cable channel Newsmax denied Friday that it intentionally destroyed or concealed internal emails in an ongoing defamation case filed by voting technology company Smartmatic over\u00a0the network\u2019s airing of false\u00a0claims about the 2020 election. Lawyers for Smartmatic previously claimed Newsmax \u201cconcealed over 200,000 documents\u201d and \u201cmade multiple material misrepresentations to the court,\u201d by falsely asserting\u00a0it\u00a0had turned over everything before the discovery process wrapped up. But the network said in filings Friday that it never meant to hide anything, and that the vast majority of the supposedly new materials were duplicates of old files. Newsmax said the allegations are\u00a0\u201cimplausible inferences\u201d and \u201cnothing more than speculation.\u201d In the wake of the 2020 election, Newsmax and other right-wing media outlets gave\u00a0airtime\u00a0to the\u00a0false\u00a0assertion that electronic voting machines had switched votes from then-President Donald Trump to Joe Biden, costing Trump the election. No evidence has ever been found to support the claim. In the months that followed, Smartmatic filed a defamation lawsuit against Newsmax and other right-wing outlets and figures, including Fox News, Rudy Giuliani and conspiracy theorist Mike Lindell.\u00a0Smartmatic and Newsmax have\u00a0since\u00a0been embroiled in the\u00a0years-long defamation case,\u00a0which\u00a0is slated to go to trial this September in Delaware Superior Court, barring an out-of-court settlement. In court filings, Smartmatic claimed some of the 200,000 documents include texts among Newsmax executives discussing the \u201cdecision not to call the (2020) election.\u201d Parts of the court papers are redacted, but the context suggests that Newsmax also turned over new emails where top executives disparaged their own shows and reporters. Smartmatic further accused Newsmax of intentionally \u201cdestroying relevant evidence\u201d by deleting texts and emails from senior officials. They claimed this \u201ccover-up\u201d was \u201ccarefully calculated\u201d to block Smartmatic from ever seeing the material. They claimed Newsmax CEO Chris Ruddy let his texts from 2020 get deleted, despite knowing they needed to be saved. \u201cRepeatedly, Newsmax has kept documents showing its actual malice and bad motive out of Smartmatic\u2019s hands,\u201d Smartmatic wrote in a court filing that was made public last week. \u201cThese were not isolated mistakes. This was by design. Newsmax has intentionally destroyed and concealed crucial evidence that is damaging to its case.\u201d But in its response Friday, Newsmax said the entire dispute over the newly found files is simply \u201can attempt (by Smartmatic) to manufacture an issue where none exists.\u201d \u201cMany of the documents Smartmatic claims were \u2018newly produced\u2019 and bear on \u2018key issues\u2019 were already in Smartmatic\u2019s possession in duplicate or near duplicate versions having been produced by Newsmax,\u201d the network said in filings made public Friday. Lawyers for the network said it transitioned legal teams in January and\u00a0reviewed\u00a0its previous document productions. They said they realized that some documents hadn\u2019t been turned over, but this was fixed \u201cas soon as Newsmax discovered this.\u201d Barring a settlement between the two parties,\u00a0the September trial\u00a0over false claims of vote rigging in the 2020 election\u00a0is set\u00a0to coincide with the 2024 election season,\u00a0as leading\u00a0Republicans continue to express doubt over whether Biden legitimately won the\u00a0previous\u00a0election. Fox News famously paid more than $787 million to Dominion Voting Systems to settle a case last year\u00a0over similar 2020 election lies on its airwaves. Newsmax, which is owned by Ruddy,\u00a0isn\u2019t a\u00a0right-wing\u00a0media juggernaut\u00a0like Fox, but\u00a0remains\u00a0influential in the pro-Trump media ecosystem, even with its smaller audience. The network\u2019s lineup features\u00a0former\u00a0Fox personalities like\u00a0Eric Bolling\u00a0and Greta Van Susteren, controversial Trump White House official\u00a0Sebastian Gorka\u00a0and Clinton ally-turned-foe Dick Morris. A trial could put Newsmax\u2019s financial future in peril, but there is one major difference between the Newsmax and Fox cases.\u00a0In the weeks following the election, Smartmatic threatened to sue Newsmax in 2020,\u00a0the network\u00a0ran an on-air segment\u00a0and\u00a0published an article saying there was \u201cno evidence\u201d that Smartmatic or Dominion ever \u201cmanipulated votes in the 2020 election.\u201d Newsmax also faces a\u00a0separate\u00a0defamation suit from Dominion.

{"id": "2024_05_24_business_nissan-suv-driveway-explosion", "text": "In the early morning of May 14, Vicki Hill was startled awake by the sound of explosions outside her home in Bethesda, Maryland. The loud bangs, she learned later, had come from the airbags of the family\u2019s SUV, a 2015 Nissan Murano that was parked in the driveway. It was on fire. \u201cI thought someone was trying to get into our house with a sledgehammer and I woke my husband up and I said something\u2019s wrong,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cAnd he ran downstairs and shouted up, \u2018Call 911, the car\u2019s on fire!\u2019\u201d Video from the home\u2019s doorbell camera,\u00a0which the family provided to CNN,\u00a0shows smoke before the fire erupts and then\u00a0engulfs the car. The cause of the fire in the Murano remains unknown. The fire is\u00a0under investigation\u00a0by Nissan. The National Highway Traffic Administration is gathering information\u00a0on the fire, as well. \u201cThe safety and security of our customers is our primary concern,\u201d a Nissan spokesperson said in a statement in response to an email asking about the fire. \u201cWe have opened an investigation into this incident.\u201d The\u00a0Hills\u2019 Murano was recalled by Nissan\u00a0in 2016 and 2019, to fix a problem that could allow brake fluid to leak and start a fire, even while the vehicle is parked. At the time, owners were warned to park their vehicles outside and away from buildings until the issue was repaired because of fire risks. A search on NHTSA\u2019s website indicated there was an outstanding unrepaired recall on the Hills\u2019 Murano. The couple said a local fire investigator suggested the unrepaired recall could have caused the fire. But the Hills remember getting the work done and provided CNN with a photograph of the receipt from a local Nissan dealership that showed the repair was made. CNN has not confirmed whether the receipt is authentic. The Hills said that because the recall work had been done, the possibility of a fire wasn\u2019t something that crossed their minds. Philip Hill had been fixing the garage, so the couple\u2019s two cars were parked in the driveway. Otherwise, the Murano would have been parked inside the garage adjoining the house. \u201cAs you can see from the video, that vehicle is so close to the house,\u201d Philip Hill told CNN. \u201cMinutes later, the house could have gone up.\u201d As it was, the garage door melted from the flames, they said. The Hills credit a neighbor\u2019s dog with saving them and their three children. The neighbor was able to call 911 before the Hills, after being alerted by her dog. The intense flames from the burning Nissan also damaged the side of the family\u2019s other car, a 2012 Mercedes C-class, leaving it unusable. Initially, the Hills were concerned they might have been victims of vandalism. But\u00a0they said\u00a0the video footage from their Nest doorbell camera\u00a0clearly\u00a0showed the vehicle spontaneously combusting. Nissan took possession of the Murano on Wednesday to study it more closely, the Hills said. As surprising as the Hills\u2019 situation may seem, vehicle fires are not uncommon. In 2022, an estimated 188,500 car and truck fires blazed in the United States, an average of more than 500 a day, according to the National Fire Protection Association. Vehicle fires caused 610 civilian deaths that year, according the NFPA.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/business/nissan-suv-driveway-explosion/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_success_talking-politics-at-work-avoid", "text": "It\u2019s a fair bet that you work with some people whose views differ strongly from yours on politically and emotionally charged issues \u2014 the upcoming US presidential election, Donald Trump\u2019s criminal indictments, Gaza, reproductive rights and climate change, to name just a few. Or maybe you just differ on how threatening those issues are. Sometimes someone with strong views\u00a0can be unnerved by a person who thinks nothing is ever a big deal, and vice-versa. Either way, the question is: How can we keep our conversations about any of these lightening rod issues from derailing our ability to work well together? For employers: Stress civility and set guardrails Regardless of any one hot-button issue, it seems like US culture has become less civil over time. And many polarizing conversations are happening at work in ways they weren\u2019t years ago, according to SHRM, the leading human resources membership association. In response, it recently created a civility index. Its pulse survey of 1,600 employees in March, while not necessarily representative of all US workers, found that respondents rated their workplaces as more civil than everyday life, but they indicated that 39% of the incivility they witnessed or experienced happened at work. Incivility is defined as rude, berating or inconsiderate behavior, lack of manners, not keeping promises or failing to take accountability when you make a mistake. A majority (66%) said they agreed or strongly agreed that incivility reduces productivity, and more than half (59%) said that it hurts employee morale. Given the known frictions of this election year, HR experts urge employers to get out front of potentially heated moments in the coming months by setting expectations now as to what is and is not acceptable. \u201cAcknowledge there are tensions in the world and strong emotions on both sides of an issue. [Tell employees] \u2018We know this is happening and we know you have strong feelings about it,\u2019\u201d said Christy\u00a0Pruitt-Haynes, global head of the talent and performance practice at the NeuroLeadership Institute. But make clear the boundaries for exchanges. For example, Pruitt-Haynes said, you might say, \u201cEveryone is entitled to their opinion \u2013 but we won\u2019t tolerate personal attacks \u2013 verbal or physical \u2013 or talking down to someone if their opinion is different.\u201d Leaders may want to remind employees of the ways they can report inappropriate behavior if it does arise, said Oliver Brecht, vice president of Workplace Options Consulting Group. Any executive setting the guardrails should also abide by them. And ideally, private-sector leaders should try not to give any hint of their views on contentious issues, said HR consultant Cindy O\u2019Peka, who works primarily with small and mid-size employers. \u201cIt could create an us/them mentality at work. It\u2019s not a good team-building environment.\u201d For employees: How to keep your cool If you find yourself in a conversation with someone at work who raises political or social views that you flatly disagree with \u2013 or even find offensive \u2013 there are many ways to have a civil exchange or to politely disengage. Take a beat and breathe: Pay attention to how you\u2019re responding internally to what\u2019s being expressed. \u201cWhen we take a moment to label what we\u2019re actually feeling, we move our response from the emotional part of our brain to the logical part of our brain,\u201d Pruitt-Haynes said. Compartmentalize: Put your colleague\u2019s views in perspective. Do they really matter so much that you\u2019re willing to risk creating bad energy by trying to convince them that they\u2019re wrong? (That\u2019s usually a futile exercise, by the way.) \u201cDon\u2019t use it as a moment to combat and convince. \u2026 Recognize that while his opinion may be contrary to yours, what is the goal of being at work? Think long-term. You work for the same employer,\u201d Pruitt-Haynes said. Focus instead on what he offers of value to you. Say it\u2019s a form of expertise. \u201cCompartmentalize who he is. He is an expert \u2013 that\u2019s the part of him you\u2019re engaging with,\u201d she said. \u201cPivot the conversation back to what your relationship really is about \u2013 a professional one.\u201d Recognize social media\u2019s effect on people\u2019s views: If you or your colleague get a lot of information about events and issues through your social media accounts, your feeds are likely dictated by an algorithm that will highlight posts that either reinforce or influence your beliefs based on your past usage. \u201cPeople are being fed through their algorithm. All [we\u2019ve] been listening to is just one side of the argument,\u201d Brecht said. \u201cThat leads us to be less tolerable and aware of where the other person is coming from.\u201d When you have an exchange, keep it civil and educational: You don\u2019t have to agree with someone, but you can be genuinely curious about their views. And you can share how you came to yours. \u201cSpeak from your own experience,\u201d Brecht said. You can ask questions about theirs as well, with respect. Remember, too, he added, \u201cWe can disagree on something but that doesn\u2019t mean we disagree on everything.\u201d Deflect and de-escalate: If someone is ranting about an issue and you don\u2019t want to engage, simply change the focus, O\u2019Peka suggests. \u201cI\u2019ll say, \u2018How is your puppy doing?\u2019 It disarms and redirects them.\u201d Of course, as is always the case at work, if someone says or does anything threatening or disrespectful, you should bring that to your manager or, if you\u2019re more comfortable, HR. But if a colleague simply expresses a view or displays support for a candidate on their clothes or at their workspace that you disagree with, it\u2019s not necessarily off-limits. It may come down to the policies in your employer\u2019s handbook regarding the dress code and other guidance on maintaining a cordial workplace, O\u2019Peka noted.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/success/talking-politics-at-work-avoid/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_media_india-elections-press-freedom-decline-intl-hnk", "text": "These days, journalist Siddique Kappan avoids controversial stories. Last time he chased a major story, a shocking rape-and-murder case, it landed the father of three in jail for more than two years, and severely damaged his career and livelihood. The 44-year-old blames his incarceration on a worsening climate for journalists in India, where arrests and harassment are growing more common. And he is far from the only journalist feeling squeezed out of their industry during Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s decade-long rule. The government of the popular but divisive leader - who has not taken a single solo press conference while in office - stands accused by opponents of suppressing media pluralism and ratcheting up the use of anti-terror legislation against reporters. And as Modi looks to win another five years in power in an ongoing nationwide election, critics fear further erosion of the protections afforded to India\u2019s free press. \u201cI think many times before I write stories,\u201d Kappan told CNN. \u201cAnytime, anywhere, anyone can file a case against me.\u201d In October 2020, Kappan was working as a freelancer for a Malayalam-language news website. He was on his way to Hathras district, in northern Uttar Pradesh state, to report on the alleged gang rape and killing of a Dalit teenager by upper-caste men. India\u2019s caste system was officially abolished decades ago, but the social hierarchy imposed on people by birth still exists in many aspects of life. Dalits are on the lowest rung. Before he arrived at the scene, he was taken into police custody, charged under anti-terror and money laundering laws. The police alleged he was part of a conspiracy to disturb the peace in the area, but he said his arrest was an attempt to tamp down on coverage of the story. He would spend 28 months in jail. Kappan was granted bail by the Supreme Court in February 2023, but while he currently walks free, his case is still making its way through the courts. Opposing his bail, the Uttar Pradesh government, led by Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court. In the document, seen by CNN, it argued against bail on the grounds Kappan had been \u201cwriting articles targeted at spreading communal tensions\u201d and was a part of a larger conspiracy to \u201cfoment religious discord and spread terror in the country.\u201d CNN has contacted the BJP at both the local and national level for comment on the case. Since his bail, Kappan has struggled to find a permanent job to provide for his family. \u201cThe main reason is the fear of newspaper bosses, the media, which depends on government advertisement, who do not want to upset the government,\u201d he told CNN. He says he is wary of more cases being brought against him, and finds himself working on \u201csafe zone\u201d stories unlikely to ruffle feathers. The treatment of journalists like Kappan has struck fear into many other reporters. \u201cThere was nothing Kappan could have done differently to avoid arrest, except not going to report,\u201d said Kaushik Raj, who works with several publications and writes on hate crimes. \u201cThis was chilling for me.\u201d India is one of the largest media markets in the world, according to the Paris-based group Reporters Without Borders (RSF), with more than 20,000 daily newspapers across the country and about 450 privately owned channels dedicated to news, which broadcast in dozens of languages. Yet despite its size and diversity, critics say the media industry is growing increasingly subservient to Modi\u2019s government. \u201cThere was a blend of public service, public interest and corporate private media that served a burgeoning urban middle class, but also showed interest in issues of rural development. Journalists were respected\u2026 Regulatory mechanisms were weak but not completely absent,\u201d said Shakuntala Banaji, professor of media, culture and social change at the London School of Economics. \u201cThey have been all but destroyed in the last 10 years,\u201d she added. According to RSF, the country fell 25 places on the Press Freedom Index between 2015 and 2023, to 161st place \u2013 below neighboring Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Nepal. In the latest index for this year it rose slightly to 159th place but remains below all neighbors except Bangladesh (165th). \u201cThere has been a sharp deterioration in the status of media over the last ten years,\u201d Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) India representative Kunal Majumder told CNN, adding that this included imprisonment and invoking terror laws to criminalize journalists. According to the CPJ, 21 journalists were imprisoned in India between 2014 and 2023, up from four between 2004 and 2013. There has also been an uptick, it said, in the use of anti-terror laws \u2013 which allow for detention without trial or charge for up to 180 days \u2013 against reporters. Police have used the same anti-terror law against a website linked to a left-leaning organisation critical of the government. In a charge sheet filed to the court recently and seen by CNN, police claimed NewsClick was responsible for stoking riots that hit New Delhi in 2020, spreading disinformation around Covid, and funding terror groups. In a statement, NewsClick said the claims were absurd and baseless, and were intended to \u201ctarget independent journalism.\u201d Its editor Prabir Purkayastha was in jail from October 3 until Wednesday, when the Supreme Court granted him bail, saying his arrest and remand were \u201cinvalid in the eyes of law.\u201d \u201cWhen the state resorts to using anti-terror laws to shut down the freedom of expression of journalists holding institutions to account, then we are deep in authoritarian rule,\u201d said Banaji from LSE. Asked about this apparent increase in hostility to journalists, Kanchan Gupta, senior advisor to the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, told CNN that media workers were not above the law. \u201cIf journalists violate the law they are open to prosecution and legal action,\u201d he said. Shrinking independent media Alleged harassment of reporters has worsened too, according to press freedom groups. The Amnesty 2022 release says Hindu nationalists feel emboldened to threaten and abuse journalists critical of the government. Ravish Kumar, one of the country\u2019s best-known journalists, said he has not felt safe for many years while people from various Hindu-nationalist organisations showered him with death threats and abuse. The face of New Delhi Television (NDTV) for more than two decades, Kumar said he chose to resign when he was told he would have to toe the government line. He said he was driven to this decision during a hostile takeover of the channel by billionaire Gautam Adani in late 2022. CNN has contacted NDTV for comment. Kumar told CNN he resigned because Adani\u2019s proximity to Modi and the BJP would leave him unable to continue asking tough questions of the government. Soon after, he started his own YouTube channel with a small team that has about 10 million subscribers. He said he took to YouTube \u2013 where his videos receive at least a million views within their first 24 hours - because there was no other option left. \u201cThere is no place for people like us in Indian media anymore,\u201d he said. Critics say TV news has been overrun by pro-government voices. With the world\u2019s largest election underway, a study of prime-time shows by media watchdog Newslaundry - that tracked more than 400 segments between February 1 and April 12 - showed that 52% of airtime was spent criticizing the opposition, while another 27% pushed pro-Modi narratives. For Kumar the pluralism of India\u2019s past is fast disappearing. \u201cThere is very little time and space left, so we\u2019re living our last moments,\u201d he said. But Gupta, of the information ministry, said it was \u201cnot true\u201d that the media toes a government line. \u201cThere are 903 satellite channels in the country,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you look at the headlines across newspapers and television channels you will see that this generalization is not true.\u201d \u201cThis entire thing of saying that the media houses or individual journalists are manipulated by the government, that is not true.\u201d Foreign correspondents It is not just local reporters who face obstacles. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation\u2019s South Asia bureau chief Avani Dias recently left the country, as did Vanessa Dougnac, regional correspondent for four French publications. Dias said the government told her that her visa extension would be denied as her reporting had \u201ccrossed a line,\u201d though the government has denied this. It said she was granted an extension the day she paid her visa fees, on 18 April, but decided to leave nonetheless on 20 April. Dougnac, an overseas citizen of India (OCI) who worked in the country for 23 years, left in February. In January, she said, she received a notice from the Ministry of Home Affairs stating that her journalistic activities were \u201cmalicious\u201d and \u201ccritical in a manner that they create a biased negative perception about India.\u201d She applied for her journalistic permit \u2013 as required for OCIs since 2022 \u2013 but was denied. \u201cThey gave no reasons nor any justifications for why they denied my permit,\u201d she told CNN from Paris. India\u2019s Home Ministry did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment about Dougnac\u2019s situation. And in February last year the Indian offices of the BBC were raided by tax authorities, weeks after the broadcaster aired a documentary highly critical of Modi. The documentary, which was described as \u201canti-India garbage\u201d by a senior advisor to the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, was later blocked on social media platforms. Speaking to reporters shortly after the BBC raids, BJP spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia made no reference to the documentary, and said companies, including media agencies, must \u201cfollow and respect Indian law.\u201d The BBC has since split its India operations into separate companies in a bid to meet the country\u2019s foreign investment rules. Dougnac said she was not surprised by the actions against international media. \u201cIt started with local journalists and slowly foreign correspondents got the sense they were next,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is what is happening now.\u201d Despite witnessing what is happening to and around him, Kappan says he has not lost faith in journalism in india. He considers advocating for it a \u201cmoral imperative.\u201d \u201cDespite the personal risks involved, the pursuit of truth remains paramount,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/media/india-elections-press-freedom-decline-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_media_trump-unified-reich", "text": "The phrase \u201cunified Reich,\u201d which appeared in a video posted by the Trump campaign and caused a firestorm of controversy, appears to have originated as placeholder text in a collection of video templates created in 2023 by a 30-year-old Turkish freelance graphic designer. The video, posted and subsequently removed by the Trump campaign earlier this week, included imagined headlines that newspapers might run if former President Donald Trump is reelected. Among them: \u201cWhat\u2019s next for America,\u201d under which the fictional article displays language that many associate with Nazi Germany, including the phrase, \u201ccreation of a unified Reich.\u201d The reference was condemned by President Joe Biden, and the Trump campaign said it didn\u2019t create the video \u2013 it was reposted by a staffer who didn\u2019t see that particular text. Bizarrely, the fake article\u2019s text appears to trace its origins to a graphic designer named Enes \u015eim\u015fek who lives near Istanbul. In an exclusive interview with CNN, \u015eim\u015fek said that the Trump ad appears to have been created from video graphics he built in May of last year, designed to give customers the option of building something that looked like an old-fashioned newsreel. \u015eim\u015fek said he actually searched Google for text about World War I \u2013 not World War II \u2013 and copied language he found and pasted it into in the newspaper article: \u201cGerman industrial strength and production had significantly increased after 1871, driven by the creation of a unified Reich.\u201d As first reported by the AP, the phrase appeared to have been lifted from a Wikipedia entry on World War I. According to Wikipedia\u2019s logs, that phrase was created on November 15, 2022, and it has since been removed. The phrase does not reference Nazi Germany. It was supposed to be dummy text \u2013 placeholder language that the customer could ultimately replace, he said. \u015eim\u015fek built the template to allow the customer who purchased it to swap in their own language. But \u015eim\u015fek believes the Trump video kept the text from his original template. \u015eim\u015fek says he has sold just 16 copies of the template at $21 a pop. It has appeared in at least two other online videos: a French-language video posted to Facebook that contains the dummy text and a music video posted to YouTube. They appear to have no political context. CNN discovered the video template on Video Hive, a motion graphics template store. After \u015eim\u015fek\u00a0was contacted through the contact form on the video template page, he responded via email that he was the creator of the template. \u201cI didn\u2019t know it is my power to change politics \u2026 I don\u2019t know what could be crazier than that,\u201d said \u015eim\u015fek in a video call. \u201cImagine if your work shakes a country.\u201d A web cache confirms the template dates back at least a year, long before the Trump ad was shared online. What is a video template? Rather than create every video from scratch, video editors often search online graphics stores for templates they can manipulate and insert in their work. They often pay a fee to the designer for access to the template. Motion graphics templates are a useful tool in video production, noted Bill Byrne, a motion graphics designer and Lecturer of Arts and Entertainment Technologies at the University of Texas at Austin. \u201dTemplates are designed to speed up the production process and to do it quickly and cheaply,\u201d said Byrne. According to Byrne, the inclusion of the placeholder text in the final video appears to be an oversight by the video\u2019s creator. \u201cAnd an unfortunate one,\u201d he added. A flummoxed designer Outside Istanbul, \u015eim\u015fek was at his desk in his office when he noticed that his work had somehow made news in American politics. Surprised by the phrase being attributed to Trump, \u015eim\u015fek attempted to correct the record. According to an email he shared with CNN, \u015eim\u015fek sent a letter to Support@truthsocial.com with the email subject line: \u201cFrom the \u2018REICH\u2019 video template Author.\u201d \u201cHi. I am the initial author of that \u2018REICH\u2019 video template. If you need an official statement just let me know,\u201d wrote \u015eim\u015fek. He did not receive a reply. For \u015eim\u015fek, seeing his work end up in the spotlight of American politics \u2014 a country he has never even visited \u2014 has been surreal. \u201cIt\u2019s really the most unthinkable thing that\u2019s ever happened to me,\u201d said \u015eim\u015fek, who doesn\u2019t follow either American or Turkish politics. \u015eim\u015fek was again floored when he saw the video of Biden responding to the Trump video. When asked what his message to Biden about Trump\u2019s video would be, he said: \u201cThis is not his fault.\u201d \u201cAnd also, I am Enes,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to come to America.\u201d \u015eim\u015fek says Envato, the marketplace that hosts the template, on Thursday contacted him and gave a directive to remove the \u201cunified Reich\u201d phrase from the template or face its deletion. \u015eim\u015fek replaced the phrase, and wrote a blog post in an attempt to further clarify the story. The company did not return a request for comment. \u201cWhen I was doing this job, I never even thought that one day such an event would happen,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBy the way, thank you to Trump for choosing my template.\u201d A history of Nazi language Trump has made several allusions to Nazi imagery in the past, including using the phrase \u201cpoisoning the blood of our country\u201d when referencing immigrants, which echoed Adolf Hitler\u2019s Mein Kampf. Trump also allegedly praised Hitler, according to former White House chief of staff John Kelly, who was quoted by CNN\u2019s Jim Sciutto in his new book \u201cThe Return of Great Powers.\u201d Kelly commented: \u201cHe said, \u2018Well, but Hitler did some good things.\u2019 I said, \u2018Well, what?\u2019 And he said, \u2018Well, (Hitler) rebuilt the economy.\u2019 Trump has denied the comments and that the conversation happened. The recent video shared by Trump\u2019s campaign led some critics to believe the phrase\u2019s inclusion in the video was purposeful \u2013 meant to be an ideological dog whistle. The Trump campaign did not respond directly to questions about the origins of the \u201cunified Reich\u201d language in the video but reiterated a previous statement issued earlier this week that said the ad had been reposted by a staffer. \u201cThis was not a campaign video, it was created by a random account online and reposted by a staffer who clearly did not see the word, while the President was in court,\u201d Karoline Leavitt, a campaign spokesperson, said in a statement. The Biden campaign, however, said this was part of a pattern of of troubling rhetoric from Trump. \u201cThis week\u2019s video is part of a pattern and reflects Donald Trump\u2019s values and embrace of white supremacists and antisemitism,\u201d said James Singer, a Biden campaign spokesperson. \u201cHe does so repeatedly, explicitly, and with overwhelming clarity. Suggesting otherwise or excusing his behavior only aids and abets his hate.\u201d According to the Bulwark, the original source of the video was from an anonymous Pro-Trump meme account posting on X under the alias @ramble_rants. The Dilley Meme Team, a collective of pro-Trump meme makers whose ranks include @ramble_rants, did not return a request for comment. \u015eim\u015fek, aware of the controversy, urged people to chill out. \u201cI love all the American people,\u201d \u015eim\u015fek said. \u201cAnd please calm down. This is just a template. And, also, I\u2019m not a Nazi.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/media/trump-unified-reich/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_business_biden-gas-prices-memorial-day", "text": "For many Americans, Memorial Day weekend marks the start of the summer travel season as millions of people head to parks, beaches and other vacation destinations. This summer is no exception: Nearly 44 million people are expected to skip town this Memorial Day, the highest number since 2005, according to AAA. Road trips, in particular, are expected to set a record, which could send gas prices higher. There\u2019s no relief in the air, either: Thursday was the second-busiest day for travel in TSA history, as it screened just shy of 2.9 million passengers. Friday is expected to be even busier. This week, the Biden administration said it would take action to keep prices at the pump in check, selling one million barrels of gasoline from a never-before-used emergency stockpile called the Northeast Gasoline Supply Reserve. \u201cBy strategically releasing this reserve in between Memorial Day and July 4th, we are ensuring sufficient supply flows to the tri-state and northeast at a time hardworking Americans need it the most,\u201d Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said in a statement on Tuesday. But, just as a US president cannot solely take the blame for surging oil prices, nor can he or she, in most cases, be entirely credited for steadying prices. The true impact of this strategic release will likely be negligible, oil market experts said \u2013 and the sale was mandated by Congress earlier this year. \u201cThis is a non-starter and won\u2019t do much to lower gas prices,\u201d GasBuddy\u2019s Patrick DeHaan said. \u201cBut it will help get rid of a reserve that wasn\u2019t really practical or usable.\u201d Although a strategic sale of one million barrels of gas sounds like a lot, the US consumed nearly 9 million gasoline barrels per day last year, according to the US Energy Information Administration. That means the Biden administration\u2019s planned release, which will happen in the coming weeks, translates to less than three hours of national demand. While the Biden administration may have timed the sale from the government-owned oil supply to coincide with the busy holiday travel season, Congress directed the administration to draw down and close the NSGR, created as part of then-President Obama\u2019s response to Superstorm Sandy. According to the US Department of Energy, the reserve was created after the 2012 storm caused heavy damage to oil refineries in the Northeast, leaving some gas stations without fuel for weeks. The reserve currently holds gasoline barrels in New York and Maine. Biden has tapped other US-owned oil reserves during his presidency. In the wake of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Biden attempted to stem rising oil prices by authorizing the release of 180 million barrels of oil in coordination with US allies overseas. At the time, the President said it would act as a \u201cwartime bridge\u201d as the US and global oil production ramped back up after the Covid-19 pandemic. Tom Kloza, the global head of energy analysis at the Oil Price Information Service, said he believed the Biden administration would be making a mistake if he were to take credit for recent steady oil prices after the one-million-barrel release. \u201cBy depicting this as a move to save consumers money, they risk being blamed if prices spike higher this summer,\u201d said Tom Kloza, the global head of energy analysis at the Oil Price Information Service. While Kloza doesn\u2019t expect a surge in oil prices, he said it was possible that warm summer temperatures could cause refineries to shut down or slow, causing a price spike. Gas prices have remained steady in recent weeks after rising sharply at the end of winter. On Thursday, the national average for regular gas was $3.61, slightly above the average since 2020, according to AAA. The current price at the pump is slightly higher than it was heading into Memorial Day last year at $3.54 a gallon, but significantly lower than the price two years ago, when the national average was above $4.50. - CNN\u2019s Matt Egan and Gregory Wallace contributed to this report.

{"id": "2022_04_25_business_electric-hybrid-corvette", "text": "General Motors will produce a fully electric Chevrolet Corvette, GM President Mark Reuss announced in a LinkedIn post Monday morning.  Reuss didn\u2019t say when the electric Corvette would come, but he hinted that a hybrid model could come relatively soon. \u201cWe will offer an electrified Corvette as early as next year,\u201d he wrote. An accompanying video the company posted to Twitter showed what appeared to be a hybrid Corvette, and in another first, showed the front wheels spinning and throwing snow as if being powered. All Corvettes produced by the company previously have been rear-wheel-drive only. While Reuss\u2019s post implies a hybrid Corvette will be based on the current generation of the car, it\u2019s not clear if the all-electric version will be a variation of this car or a completely different future model. \u201cElectrified\u201d is an auto industry term encompassing everything from hybrid to fully electric vehicles, and anything with an electric motor can count as \u201celectrified.\u201d It has long been rumored that the current generation of the Corvette, the first with its gasoline engine mounted behind the seats instead of in the front, could be built with a hybrid system. Reuss has also previously hinted there would be electrified variants of the car. Various companies are working on electric sports cars. Most all-electric vehicles in production so far have been four-door sedans and SUVs, as the need for batteries lends itself to larger and heavier vehicles. Tesla\u2019s first car, the Lotus Elise-based Tesla Roadster, was an electric sports car, but the second-generation of Tesla Roadster, originally unveiled as a prototype in 2017, has yet to go into production. Some manufacturers, such as Lamborghini, have said that current battery technology doesn\u2019t allow for a optimum sports car performance from a purely electric vehicle. Lamborghini has been working on plug-in hybrid sports cars, though. To date, the Corvette is only available in the base Stingray version with 6.2-liter V8 engine producing up to 495 horsepower. A 670 horsepower Corvette Z06 with a 5.5-liter V8 was unveiled last fall. The previous generation of the Corvette included included a 755-horsepower ZR1 version. Nothing like that has yet been announced for the current model but GM engineers have said a major reason for putting the engine in the back was to allow for better performance at extremely high horsepower levels. Besides saving gas, hybrid systems can also be used in high-performance cars to add additional power and to provide for quicker acceleration since electric motors can provide power to the wheels more quickly than gas engines. Ferrari\u2019s most powerful sports cars are hybrids, for instance.   GM has said it plans to produce only zero-emission vehicles, meaning fully electric or powered by hydrogen fuel cells, by 2035.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/25/business/electric-hybrid-corvette/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit", "text": "When Apple launched its first Mac computer in 1984, with its iconic Mac smiley-face \u201chello\u201d greeting, it wanted to differentiate itself in the fledgling PC market. The Mac was approachable with its friendly, innovative design \u2013 Apple\u2019s way of setting the Mac apart in the confusing PC landscape. That consumer-friendly mantra still exists today, with Apple carefully curating an easy-breezy yet controlled user experience across its products, including the billions of iPhones used around the world. But the Biden administration believes Apple took that too far. On Thursday, the Department of Justice sued Apple for illegally monopolizing the smartphone market. In a press conference, the government provided a long list of how Apple has allegedly squashed competition with restrictive app store terms, high fees and its \u201cwalled-garden\u201d approach, restricting how third-party companies interact with its brands and services. The company denied the lawsuit\u2019s allegations and said it plans to fight them. Apple added that the lawsuit could empower the government \u201cto take a heavy hand in designing people\u2019s technology.\u201d But if successful, the lawsuit could ripple across Apple\u2019s products and services. Although the suit could take years to play out, here\u2019s a closer look what it may eventually mean for iPhone users: Changes to the App Store If found liable, the company could be forced to change a number of things. One such change is how iPhone users could get greater access to \u201csuper apps\u201d that have been largely restricted before. The term refers to one-stop-shop apps that allow for messaging, ordering food, payment processing and other capabilities all within one platform.  According to Dipanjan Chatterjee, a principal analyst at market research firm Forrester, super apps most threaten Apple\u2019s preeminence in the lives of its customers. \u201cAn offering like WeChat, dubbed China\u2019s everything app, can provide an alternative to the Apple ecosystem for people to communicate, bank, share memories, talk to businesses and more,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cWhat Apple fears most is becoming irrelevant to its customers.\u201d At the same time, super apps like WeChat are created by larger companies and could, therefore, put some smaller companies at a disadvantage. And the concept hasn\u2019t been welcomed much in the US anyway. The US government, however, could argue that lack of interest may be due to Apple\u2019s high share of the smartphone market and its resistance to offer super apps in its store, Chatterjee said. Better interoperability Apple may also be required to offer more support for cross-platform messaging, an issue the company previously said it\u2019s already working on. The company lets iPhone users send high-quality photos and videos to one another, but similar texts to Android phones are slower and grainy. It also maintains those messages in green bubbles, creating a kind of class divide, critics argue. In November, the company said it will add new features, such as read receipts, typing indicators, better support for group chats and higher quality media sharing of images and videos, across platforms to help close the gap. Apple\u2019s move to add support for the standard called RCS (rich communication services) is intended to roll out later this year. RCS is considered the replacement to alternatives such as SMS, or short messaging service, and can work over both Wi-Fi and mobile data. The change followed pressure from both regulators and competitors to more seamlessly work across operating systems. The European Union\u2019s Digital Markets Act, for example, requires companies to make their key services interoperable between platforms. The US government could require the same. More open services Another likely change is how hardware from other companies, such as smartwatches, will interact with the Apple range of devices and software, including the iPhone and Apple\u2019s services like Fitness+. The company has also required Apple Watch users to own iOS devices as a way to keep them locked into its existing ecosystem. Chatterjee said making this change would have both positives and negatives. \u201cThe net result would reside somewhere along the spectrum of access to more and cheaper options but also the devaluation of the customer experience that is so highly prized by Apple\u2019s customers,\u201d he said. The Biden administration has also taken issue with Apple\u2019s lack of support for mobile cloud services. Loosening this could allow users to access games and other cloud-based apps without having to pay for pricey hardware. Inside the debate The DOJ lawsuit claims Apple\u2019s behavior has illegally hindered competition, kept its customers locked into its products and prevented other companies from innovating. Although the Biden administration will have to prove these harms, some critics say any potential changes Apple could make will negatively impact the user experience. David McQueen, a research director at ABI Research, said he recognizes that the content and applications market should be open, and Apple needs to avoid monopolistic advantages that can restrict competition, push up prices or block innovation. But Apple\u2019s success stems in part to its tight grip on its products and services, keeping things intuitive and seamless. \u201cIf Apple is forced to comply, it could potentially spell the end to the provision of this consistent and unified user experience, although by the same token, consumers will be open to a greater choice of apps and services, helping more developers and providers,\u201d McQueen said. Chatterjee noted some people are drawn to the Apple family of products precisely because of the carefully managed ecosystem\u2019s ease of use. Apple may have to work that much harder to preserve the integrity of its experience, but any changes probably won\u2019t be enough to make customers to leave and go elsewhere. \u201cThe vast majority of Apple customers would probably be happier with some more choice and lower prices as long as it did not hamper their levels of customer experience, which is threatened by the less control Apple has over the experience,\u201d Chatterjee said. But he added those currently outside of the Apple ecosystem will likely benefit by \u201cplugging in opportunistically without having to go all in with Apple.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "business"}}

The drop came even after AI-darling Nvidia delivered stellar quarterly earnings and announced a 10-for-1 stock split. Chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) soared more than 9%\u00a0as the wider market dropped lower, highlighting a lack of market breadth. (Nvidia is not one of the 30 stocks that comprise the Dow Jones Industrial Average.) Boeing (BA) weighed on markets on Thursday, dropping more than 7.5% after the beleaguered aircraft manufacturer said its cash flows were worse than expected this year. That caused concern amongst investors that its debt ratings could be classified as junk bonds. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite, which began the day at new intraday highs, fell by 0.7% and 0.4%, respectively. The Dow, meanwhile, closed lower by 606 points, or 1.5%. Strong data The selloff came after the Purchasing Managers Index for May, expected to fall slightly, came in 3.5 percentage points higher, the highest level since last June. That\u2019s an indication that the economy is not being held back by inflation, even though price hikes have started to ease once more. \u201cTech is the only industry sector not in the red,\u201d wrote Louis Navellier of Navellier Investing in a note to clients on Thursday. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have NVIDIA in your index it\u2019s not a good day.\u201d Labor data also came in stronger than expected on Thursday morning: Weekly initial jobless claims totaled 215,000, slightly below the analyst consensus of 220,000, according to FactSet data. April new home sales missed estimates on Thursday, coming in at an annualized rate of 634,000 versus 678,000 expected. Fewer homes being built indicates that there\u2019s less economic confidence on the part of builders and that they\u2019re having more difficulty borrowing the money to build them. Fed fears The Federal Reserve spooked markets on Wednesday afternoon when they released the notes from their last policy meeting. The minutes showed that \u201cvarious\u201d officials said they would be willing to raise interest rates if necessary and that there were doubts as to whether financial conditions are restrictive enough to keep inflation from resurging. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon also said Wednesday at an event hosted by Boston College that the Fed probably won\u2019t begin to cut rates this year. \u201cI\u2019m still at zero cuts,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we\u2019re set up for stickier inflation.\u201d \u201cThe bond market set the dour mood that we see across much of the market,\u201d wrote Interactive Brokers chief strategist Steve Sosnick on Thursday. US Treasury yields rose Thursday on the positive economic news. \u201cComing on the back of yesterday\u2019s \u2018higher for longer\u2019 Fed Minutes, bond traders were in no mood to hear about a strengthening economy,\u201d wrote Sosnick. \u201cIn theory, a stronger economy should be good for companies, and thus stocks, but because we are all so obsessed with the Federal Reserve and other central bank policymakers, we see most stocks trending lower as bond prices fall.\u201d Those central bank worries have pushed investors to slash their expectations for interest rate cuts from the Fed.

{"id": "2024_05_22_business_apple-china-price-cuts-618-festival", "text": "Apple is offering unprecedented price cuts in China as big brands and retailers launch promotions for the annual \u201c618\u201d shopping festival in the face of sluggish consumer demand. The hefty discounts by the iPhone maker come at a time when it is battling stiff competition from Chinese smartphone manufacturers, such as Huawei and Vivo, and declining market share in the world\u2019s second largest economy. On Monday, Apple said it would slash prices of some of its smartphones on Tmall \u2014 an Amazon-like site owned by Alibaba \u2014 by as much 23% till May 28. Customers can now get an iPhone 15 for 4,599 yuan ($639), down 1,400 yuan ($194) from the original price, according to promotions on Apple\u2019s official store on Tmall. Apple is hoping to boost its sales during China\u2019s second biggest online shopping bonanza of the year, which usually runs from late May to mid-June. The company did not respond to a request for comment. Launched by e-commerce firm JD.com in 2008, \u201c618\u201d is beaten only by Singles Day, which was created by Alibaba in 2009. Today, both festivals eclipse\u00a0Black Friday\u00a0and\u00a0Cyber Monday in terms of total sales, and all major Chinese e-commerce sites and many brick-and-mortar retailers offer weeks of promotions across their platforms to lure customers. Stars often get in on the act, too. Rihanna appeared in Shanghai Tuesday, making a popular Chinese breakfast crepe and hosting livestream sessions showcasing her Fenty Beauty products on Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok. While Apple has been slashing prices of its iPhone 15 models and iPads sold in China since October, the discounts this month are the biggest the company has ever offered in its biggest overseas market, according to Chinese state media. \u201cApple needs to aggressively defend market share [in China],\u201d said Jefferies analysts in a note on Tuesday. Apple\u2019s China market share slid to 15.7% in the first quarter of this year, compared to 19.7% a year earlier, according to data compiled by Counterpoint Research. Huawei, meanwhile, saw sales surge 70%, closing in its gap with Apple. After Monday\u2019s price reductions, Apple\u2019s iPhone 15 is now in the same price range as smartphones made by Xiaomi and Huawei. Boycotting the price war Smartphone makers aren\u2019t the only companies waging a price war in China. Almost every sector, from food and clothing to consumer electronics and cars, is offering big discounts reflecting a dramatic shift in consumption patterns in the country. The 618 shopping festival, a key barometer of consumption in the country, has seen growing competition by e-commerce sites and retailing brands to offer discounts. But the price cutting has become so brutal that some companies are boycotting the event. More than 50 book issued joint statements on Monday, saying that they would not participate in the this year\u2019s shopping festival because of aggressive pricing policies that required them to offer discounts of 20% to 30% on JD.com. One statement, issued by 10 publishing houses in Beijing, said the boycott was a necessary move to \u201cmaintain the stability and prosperity\u201d of the book publishing market. The other statement, published by 46 companies in Shanghai, said they were against \u201cdisorderly\u201d competition in the market. Even major state-owned publishing companies voiced opposition to \u201cchaotic\u201d price wars. \u201cWe hope there will be a wider resistance to the chaos of discounting, or more effective control,\u201d a subsidiary of Shanghai Century Publishing said Monday on its official account on Xiaohongshu, the country\u2019s Instagram-like social platform.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/business/apple-china-price-cuts-618-festival/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_21_tech_microsoft-ai-copilot-plus-build-2024", "text": "Microsoft\u00a0jumped headfirst into building artificial intelligence directly into its Windows operating system on Monday, announcing new AI computers that could help ramp up flagging PC sales. The developments push the company closer to its long-time goal to \u201cbuild computers that understand us versus us having to understand computers,\u201d CEO Satya Nadella told the audience at the company\u2019s annual developer conference at its Redmond, Washington headquarters. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re really close to that real breakthrough,\u201d he added. The computers, which are packed with processors that power advanced AI tools, come as PC sales have stalled for years. The company hopes the new machines will boost sales and revive excitement, particularly as AI is expected to become increasingly part of everyday life. Microsoft\u2019s new lineup of Copilot+ PCs, which feature a new Surface Pro tablet and Surface laptop, include AI tools that don\u2019t require internet connection \u2013 the AI processing occurs directly on the device The new hardware runs on OpenAI\u2019s new GPT-4o technology, which aims to turn ChatGPT into a digital personal assistant that can engage in real-time, spoken conversations and interact using text and \u201cvision.\u201d Announced last week, it can view screenshots, photos, documents or charts uploaded by users and have a conversation about them. The new hardware also plays up Microsoft\u2019s existing AI assistant called Copilot, which works across various products, including Bing and Microsoft 365. It can help with tasks such as writing, keeping track of\u00a0emails in Outlook or designing\u00a0presentations in PowerPoint. One new feature, called Recall, acts as a personal \u201ctime machine,\u201d allowing users to quickly find things from their computer, such as documents, images and websites. Another allows for real-time translation into more than 40 more languages locally on the device. The company also showed off a new tool called Team Copilot, which serves as a personal assistant, allowing it act as a meeting facilitator to create agendas or take notes on behalf of the whole team, not just an individual user. Microsoft isn\u2019t alone in its AI PC ambition. Dell and Lenovo also recently debuted AI-first PC computers under the Copilot+ AI umbrella, an emerging category that experts widely believe will become the next stage of computing. (Copilot+ is the name of the line of hardware that supports the Copilot software.) Next month, Apple is expected to announce new AI-powered tools for the iPhone and Mac at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference. \u201cOver time, AI capability will become a ubiquitous feature, but Microsoft and its partners have made a solid start,\u201d Geoff Blaber, CEO at CCS Insight, told CNN. \u201cThey will need to work hard to ensure that AI becomes a lot more than just a meaningless descriptor with a growing number of features.\u201d Microsoft\u2019s advancements also come at a time when the PC market is ripe for innovation. \u201cThis is a much-needed catalyst,\u201d Blaber added. Although the Surface line is relatively small within the overall PC market, it serves as an aspirational brand and a frontrunner in terms of innovation, according to Jitesh Ubrani, a research manager at market research firm IDC. But Microsoft\u2019s move is more reflective of a greater shift happening in the industry toward AI. In June, Apple will likely introduce generative AI \u2013 artificial intelligence that is capable of creating new output from images to text \u2013 across its iOS and Mac platforms. Reports indicate the company could unveil an AI-powered chatbot that runs on OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT technology, the same technology that underpins Microsoft\u2019s new CoPilot+ line. Still, Microsoft has already established itself as an early leader in this space with ChatGPT integrated into key products. And it appears those efforts are paying off. Last month, Microsoft reported quarterly profits of $21.9 billion, up from $18.3 billion a year ago. Revenue grew 17% year-over-year growth to $61.9 billion. Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud business also experienced strong growth \u2013 revenue grew 31% \u2013 boosted by AI tailwinds. The company continues to go all in on AI in other ways, too. Earlier this month, Microsoft said it is pouring $3.3 billion into building a data hub in Wisconsin to train employees and manufacturers on how to best use artificial intelligence. The new center aims to create 2,300 union construction jobs and 2,000 permanent jobs over time, according to Microsoft. It also plans to use the center to train about 100,000 workers across the state.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/tech/microsoft-ai-copilot-plus-build-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl", "text": "Sam Altman has agreed to return to lead OpenAI, the company said in a Tuesday post on X, just days after his surprise ouster as chief executive sparked an employee revolt that threatened to undermine what has been the leading company in the fledgling artificial intelligence industry. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman wrote that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft, which is the ChatGPT maker\u2019s biggest financial backer. The announcement appears to bring to an end days of chaos for the AI industry that included negotiations over who should lead OpenAI and how the firm should be run, as well as broader discussions about just how fast the arms race to develop AI technology should be moving. The details of Altman\u2019s firing and re-hiring remain murky. In its announcement Friday, OpenAI claimed that Altman had been insufficiently \u201ccandid\u201d with the board. That ambiguous language sent the rumor mill flying. But a key factor in Altman\u2019s ouster was the presence of\u00a0tensions between Altman, who favored pushing AI development more aggressively, and members of the original OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the crisis. As of Monday morning, Nadella had announced that Altman, along with fellow OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, would be joining Microsoft to lead a new AI research division. OpenAI said it had hired former Twitch chief Emmett Shear as interim CEO. But then hundreds of OpenAI employees, nearly the company\u2019s entire staff, threatened to leave, potentially for Microsoft, if the company\u2019s board didn\u2019t resign and reinstate Altman as CEO. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it invested billions in to help bolster its ambitions in developing AI, which many in Silicon Valley think will be the most important wave of technological advancement in the coming decades. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Microsoft CEO\u00a0Satya Nadella said on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d Altman\u2019s vision to quickly roll out and commercialize AI tools also appears to have won out. Publicly, Altman has long cautioned about risks posed by AI, and he\u202fhas pledged to lawmakers and customers that he would move OpenAI forward responsibly. \u201cIs [AI] gonna be like the printing press that diffused knowledge, power and learning widely across the landscape that empowered ordinary, everyday individuals that led to greater flourishing, that led above all to greater liberty?\u201d he said in a May Senate subcommittee hearing pressing for regulation. \u201cOr is it gonna be more like the atom bomb \u2014 huge technological breakthrough, but the consequences (severe, terrible) continue to haunt us to this day?\u201d But inside the company, Altman had been pushing to bring products to market more quickly and to sell them for a profit. Altman announced a few weeks ago at OpenAI\u2019s first-ever developer day that the company would make tools available so anyone could create their own version of ChatGPT. OpenAI has also worked with Microsoft to roll out ChatGPT-like technology across Microsoft\u2019s products. OpenAI and iPhone designer Jony Ive had also reportedly\u202fbeen in talks to raise $1 billion from Japanese conglomerate SoftBank for an AI device to replace the smartphone. \u2014 CNN\u2019s Juliana Liu and Diksha Madhok contributed reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_20_success_interest-rates-savings-cash", "text": "The Federal Reserve\u2019s benchmark interest rate remains at a 23-year high. That\u2019s thanks to the central bank\u2019s decision Wednesday to once again hold it steady, as it has done at the policy-making committee\u2019s past five meetings. That decision may be disappointing to some investors, homebuyers and those with a lot of credit card debt, since movement in the Fed\u2019s overnight lending rate influences rates \u2014 directly or indirectly \u2014 on consumer financial products (e.g., credit cards, bank loans and mortgages). But\u00a0with the Fed signaling that no rate cuts are likely until summer, it also means anyone with savings still has at least a few more months to make hay of their stash. That\u2019s because you can still get inflation-beating interest rates that will grow any money you have set aside for emergencies, vacations, down payments or any other goal in your sights over the next several years. However, that won\u2019t happen if you just let it sit in a traditional checking or savings account that yields next to nothing. There are more lucrative, low-risk options out there, with rates that are still at or near their peaks. \u201cBut perhaps not for much longer,\u201d said Ted Rossman, senior analyst at Bankrate. \u201cIf one of those fits into your financial plans, it\u2019s best to act soon.\u201d So, consider the following options when deciding where to park your hard-earned savings. High-yield online savings accounts The average annual percentage yield on bank savings accounts was just 0.52% as of March 13, according to Bankrate. That average is kept low by the biggest brick-and-mortar banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, which still are offering a paltry 0.01%. By contrast, there are still FDIC-insured online banks offering inflation-beating rates of between 4.35% and 5.35% on their high-yield savings accounts. Generally speaking, these are the best vehicles in which to keep your emergency funds for quick, easy access. Choosing between an account that pays 0.52% and one that pays 5.35% can mean forfeiting hundreds of dollars in interest. \u201cIf you put $10,000 in a savings account, that\u2019s a difference of $496 in interest earnings over the course of the year, assuming monthly compounding,\u201d Rossman said. While the rates on high-yield savings accounts have gone down a bit in recent months, \u201cwidespread cuts in online savings account rates are unlikely until the first Fed rate cut is near,\u201d said Ken Tumin, founder of DepositAccounts.com. As with any bank savings rate, high-yield savings account\u00a0rates\u00a0can change overnight, and the bank may not alert you when it lowers it. So make sure to check your monthly statement. Certificates of deposits Another high-return, low-risk investment that is great for money you likely won\u2019t need to tap for a few months or even a couple of years is a certificate of deposit. You can get the best returns on CDs through a brokerage such as Schwab, E*Trade or Fidelity. That\u2019s because you can comparison shop for CDs from any number of FDIC-insured banks and will not have to set up individual accounts with each institution. As of March 13, the average rate on a one-year CD was 1.95%, but some banks are offering as much are 5.4%. If you can get a one-year CD at, say, 5.4%, you will make $540 on a $10,000 investment. To get the greatest benefit from a CD, you have to leave the money invested for a fixed period. You can always access your principal sooner if you need to, but there may be early withdrawal penalties. As of March 20, CDs listed on Schwab.com with durations from three months up to three years were all yielding between 5.2% and 5.51%. CD rates on durations between four and 10 years ranged from 4.40% to 5.15%. Say you invest $10,000 in a one-year CD with a 5.36%\u00a0APY. At the end of that period, you\u2019d get your principal back plus $536 in interest when the CD matures, according to Bankrate\u2019s CD calculator. If you chose a two-year CD at 5.25%, you\u2019d bank an extra $1,078, assuming compounding interest. The same investment in a five-year CD at 5.15% would earn $2,854. \u201cIt makes sense to go long with CDs. To hedge your bets, include terms from one to five years. Starting a CD ladder will provide this mix,\u201d Tumin said. If you don\u2019t go through a brokerage you may get a reasonable deal from your primary bank, Tumin said. For example, he noted, Wells Fargo is still offering up to 5.01% on both 4-month and 7-month CDs. Or, at Bank of America, you can get up to 4.75% on a 7-month CD. But Tumin cautions that with any big bank CD you should take your money out at the end of the term, otherwise your bank may automatically renew it and lock you in to a much lower-yielding CD. Money market accounts and funds If you don\u2019t want to set up an online savings account at another bank, your own bank may offer you a money market deposit account that pays a higher yield than your regular checking or savings accounts. Money market accounts may have higher minimum deposit requirements than a regular savings account, but they are more liquid than a fixed-term certificate of deposit or Treasury bill, meaning they give you access to your money more quickly while still potentially giving you some of the highest yields available, said Doug Ornstein, senior manager for integrated solutions at TIAA Wealth Management. But don\u2019t confuse money market accounts with money market mutual funds, which invest in short-term, low-risk debt instruments. As of March 19, they had an average 7-day yield of 5.14%, according to the Crane Money Fund Index, which tracks the top 100 taxable money market funds. Unlike money market deposit accounts, money market mutual funds are not insured by the FDIC. But if you invest in a money market fund through a brokerage, your overall account is likely to be insured through the Securities Investor Protection Corp, which offers protection in the event your brokerage ever goes under. Treasury bills and notes Another option for money you can leave untouched anywhere from several months to a few years is to buy short-term Treasury bills and medium-term notes, which are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. Three- and six-month bills had yields of 5.39% and 5.33%\u00a0respectively on March 20 before the Fed\u2019s meeting ended, while nine-month and one-year bills were offering 5.19% and 5.08%\u00a0respectively, according to rates posted on Schwab.com for a $25,000 investment. Rates on Treasury notes with durations from two years to 10 years ranged between 4.29% and 4.72%. If you\u2019re someone who manages your portfolio like a hawk, you may feel comfortable buying T-bills on your own from TreasuryDirect.gov. But if you don\u2019t, it might be easier just to buy new issues through your brokerage account or invest in a short-term bond index fund or ETF, said Andy Smith, executive director of financial planning at Edelman Financial Engines. And if you\u2019re looking at money that will be needed in three to five years, you might consider a diversified fund of highly rated government and corporate bonds, Ornstein said. An 18-month AAA-rated corporate bond, for instance, was yielding 4.82% this week, while the three-year was at 4.49%. Meanwhile, three-year AAA-rated municipal bonds (which are issued by local governments) had a rate of 3.98%, according to Schwab.com. Don\u2019t chase yield When deciding on the best accounts and investments for your specific goals and peace of mind, it may pay to consult a fee-only fiduciary adviser \u2014 meaning, someone who doesn\u2019t get paid a commission to sell you a particular investment. What you\u2019ll always want to do is build in flexibility for yourself so you can easily access cash, regardless of your timeline for key goals. \u201cWhat happens if something changes and you need that down payment a lot sooner \u2014 or your parents need medical care fast?\u201d Smith said. That means balancing your desire for great yield with a need and desire for ease of access without penalty. Translation: Don\u2019t chase yield for yield\u2019s sake. Think of it this way, Ornstein said: Unless you have huge sums to invest or are an institutional investor, the difference between getting a 5.1% yield versus 5% is negligible, and in fact it could even cost you more if there are penalties for taking your money out early. \u201cMost of the time convenience is really important. Give up the 0.1%,\u201d he advised.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/20/success/interest-rates-savings-cash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_15_success_best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund", "text": "The average federal tax refund is more than $3,000, according to the latest data from the IRS. Since the majority of tax filers get a refund, there\u2019s a fair chance you could get hundreds if not thousands of dollars back in overpaid taxes, especially if you\u2019re also owed a refund from your state government. That money may feel like a windfall, and it\u2019s easy to squander it on a lot of little things. But if you\u2019re looking to improve your current financial situation, here are seven ideas to consider. Well, technically six, but you\u2019ll enjoy the seventh the most. 1. Pay off high-rate debt If you are carrying a balance on your credit card and are paying 20% to 30% in interest, make this your first priority to pay down. At such sky-high rates, \u201cthe debt can grow faster than you can pay it off,\u201d said Eric Bronnenkant, a certified financial planner and head of tax at Betterment, a robo-advisory financial services firm that also has a human advice team on hand to help clients. Keyana Russ, a certified financial planner at Four Ponds Financial Planning, concurred that people\u2019s awareness of how much money they\u2019re paying in interest over time doesn\u2019t always register. \u201cWhat I usually see is people paying the minimum, or they\u2019re charging everyday expenses and not paying off the bill at the end of the month. \u2026 They don\u2019t understand how much interest they\u2019re paying,\u201d Russ said. For example, if you\u2019re carrying a $3,000 balance at 27% interest and you only pay a required minimum of $97.50 every month, it will take you 240 months (which is 20 years) just to pay off the $3,000 \u2014 and, in addition, you will have paid $3,044.57 in interest, for a total of $6,044.57, according to Bankrate.com\u2019s calculator. 2. Create or add to an emergency fund You can use your refund to start or bolster an emergency fund. When it comes to costly emergencies, there are many Americans who don\u2019t have at least three months\u2019 worth of living expenses set aside, let alone enough to easily handle an unexpected bill of $1,000. Be sure to stash the money in a high-yield savings account at an FDIC-insured bank, Russ suggested, noting that the best interest rates are typically offered by online banks. If you have high-rate debt and you\u2019re lacking emergency savings, Russ suggested you might use a portion of your refund to attack your debt and the other portion to create an emergency fund. Bronnenkant favors paying off the high-rate debt first, but, if you\u2019re low on emergency savings and need a critical repair to help keep your job \u2014 such as on your car \u2014 he said it might make sense to set aside money for that repair and put the rest toward your credit card or other high-rate debt. 3. Make an extra payment on your mortgage If you\u2019re carrying a mortgage at a high rate (e.g., 7% to 8%), and you\u2019re not saddled with credit card debt, you might consider making an extra payment or two. \u201cIt can make a difference in the long run towards your principal,\u201d Russ said.\u00a0 You can even view it as an additional form of savings, in the sense that you\u2019re saving yourself an extra 7% \ufeffor so in interest on the portion of the principal you\u2019re paying down, Bronnenkant noted. 4. Invest in a Roth IRA If your income qualifies you to contribute to a Roth IRA, you can contribute up to $7,000 this year ($8,000 if you\u2019re at least 50) with after-tax savings. That money will grow untaxed until retirement, at which point your withdrawals will be tax-free and penalty-free after age 59-1/2, assuming the account has been open for at least five years. (And note: You can still make a 2023 Roth contribution until April 15 this year. The contribution limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if you\u2019re age 50 or older. Bolstering your tax-free retirement savings is great.\u00a0But if you need to access some of your money well before you retire, you may take out any part of your contributions tax-free and penalty-free at any time, \ufeffBronnenkant said. You would only be taxed and penalized if you withdrew the earnings on your contributions before age 59-1/2. (For more information on Roth IRA withdrawal rules, here is an easy-to-understand rundown from Charles Schwab.) 5. Contribute enough to your 401(k) in 2024 to get your full employer match Speaking of retirement savings, if you\u2019re not yet contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match from your employer, a refund can make that easier. Say you get $3,000 back. You can put that money in a high-yield savings account to earn interest. Then, on your workplace 401(k) site, change your paycheck contribution levels so that by the end of the year you will have contributed $3,000 more in pre-tax money than you otherwise would have. For instance, say you\u2019re paid every two weeks and you have 20 more paychecks left until the end of the year. You can boost you biweekly contributions by $150 per paycheck ($150 x 20 = $3,000). \u201cYou want to get the max match from your employer,\u201d Bronnenkant said. 6. Invest for shorter-term goals If in the next three to 10 years you expect to buy a home, take a once-in-a-lifetime trip, renovate a room, send your kids to summer camp or have any other expensive goal, you might consider investing your refund in a diversified mix of low-cost, broad market index funds. The shorter term your goal is, the less risk you want to take. If you need the money within three years, you might consider putting your refund in certificates of deposits and US Treasury bonds. But if your goal is five to 10 years out, and you\u2019re comfortable taking on some more risk and are willing to accept fluctuations in the market, Bronnenkant said, you might put no more than 30% of your refund in a stock index fund and 70% in a total market bond fund if your risk tolerance is conservative; or 50% in each if you have a moderate risk tolerance. If you plan on sending your child to college and you have a 529 plan, you can use your refund to boost your contributions to that plan, Russ said. You may also get a tax break for your contribution depending on the state where you live. 7. Have some fun Unless you\u2019re in truly dire financial straits, if you get a large refund, you might set aside a small portion to do whatever you truly enjoy. \u201cSometimes you just want to have fun and not have it be all business,\u201d Russ said. \u201cYou can set aside some of the money to have fun.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/15/success/best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_business_us-economy-whats-happening", "text": "The US economy is giving off weird vibes right now. There are millions of job openings and the unemployment rate is low. In fact, it hasn\u2019t been this low for such a long stretch of time in decades. You\u2019d think that would mean the economy is coasting, since periods of low unemployment are generally associated with higher rates of economic prosperity. But there\u2019s a slew of red flags right now \u2014 like a large and growing share of people, particularly Gen Zers, taking on such high levels of credit card debt to cover their spending that lenders have stopped loaning more money to them. That seems to be the case with a lot of recent economic data: No piece of good news comes without other evidence that give economists pause. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t give the economy a clean bill of health,\u201d said Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY. \u201cIt looks robust, but there are pockets of concern.\u201d But while the state of the economy has economists weighing their words, presidential candidates see it in more binary terms. For instance, President Joe Biden tells voters the economy is booming and has hardly ever been doing better \u2014 even though, as he frequently says, there\u2019s still work to be done. Yet from former President Donald Trump\u2019s vantage point, \u201cthe economy is crashing\u201d and is in total disarray, he said at a recent campaign rally in Wisconsin. Here\u2019s what\u2019s really going on. The good If you\u2019re already optimistic about the economy\u2019s current state, you\u2019re going to feel even better by parsing through some of the latest labor market data. Currently, there are 8.5 million job openings. That exceeds the number of pre-pandemic job openings by 1.5 million. Meanwhile, there are 6.5 million unemployed people. That means there\u2019s more than one job per job seeker. In the decade preceding the pandemic, that ratio was 0.6 on average, signifying there were more job seekers than the number of job openings. Americans\u2019 average hourly earnings are 22% higher than before the pandemic, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Though wage increases have been slowing, they\u2019re rising at a faster rate than prices. That\u2019s good news for consumers, since it means their income is stretching further. The bad Though inflation has cooled significantly from its peak in the summer of 2022, further progress toward the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% target is looking like it\u2019ll be a lengthy process. That trajectory has taken many Fed officials by surprise, including Gov. Christopher Waller who thought the economy would be in a good position for cutting interest rates by now. \u201cHowever, the first three months of 2024 threw cold water on that outlook, as data on both inflation and economic activity came in much hotter than anticipated,\u201d Waller said in a speech Tuesday. But he said April Consumer Price Index data, which showed headline inflation levels cooled slightly, was \u201cwelcome relief.\u201d \u201cIf I were still a professor and had to assign a grade to this inflation report, it would be a C+\u2014 far from failing but not stellar either,\u201d he added. But at the same time,\u00a0consumers believe that inflation will move higher in the year ahead, according to two surveys Fed officials monitor closely. Since inflation expectations can effectively control the pace of price hikes, businesses take those expectations into account when pricing goods and services. That can lead to higher prices. However, an early reading on retail spending for April came in much weaker than expected as consumers reined in their spending. That\u2019s good in the sense that it doesn\u2019t give retailers the ability to pass along higher prices to consumers if they aren\u2019t willing to accept them, which had previously been the case. But given consumer spending is one of the biggest drivers of the economy, a pullback can have adverse effects, too. \u201cIt certainly bears watching, but part of the weakness probably was \u2018payback\u2019 for strength in prior months,\u201d David Alcaly, lead macroeconomic strategist at Lazard, told CNN. Daco said he sees the retail sales report as a sign that consumers are \u201ca little more cautious, but are not retrenching.\u201d However, if spending starts to slow a lot more, that could negatively impact the economy, he said. The ugly The biggest flashing red light in the economy right now is the level of debt people are racking up. One reason consumer spending has held up so well in the face of higher-than-desirable inflation combined with the highest interest rates in over two decades is that consumers aren\u2019t necessarily spending within their means. The savings many accumulated during the pandemic have all but evaporated, leading to a lot more credit card purchases that aren\u2019t being paid back on time. That, combined with the gradually cooling labor market \u2014 which is reducing workers\u2019 leverage \u2014 is causing some households to accumulate more debt and fall into serious delinquency, meaning 90+ days late on a payment. Recent New York Fed data showed the percentage of credit card balances in serious delinquency climbed to its highest level since 2012. \u201cThe rising levels of consumer\u00a0debt\u00a0and delinquency rates, if continued, are not just individual problems; they could have macroeconomic effects requiring attention from economic policymakers,\u201d Sung Won Sohn, a Loyola Marymount University economics and finance professor and chief economist of SS Economics, wrote in a recent note. \u201cAs more income is directed toward\u00a0debt\u00a0repayment, consumers have less disposable income for other purchases.\u201d The rising delinquencies will likely force banks and other lenders to lend less money to borrowers deemed riskier or cause lenders to charge even higher interest rates, he said. Ultimately, these combined effects \u201ccan contribute to a broader economic slowdown \u2014 or even a recession.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/business/us-economy-whats-happening/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_03_12_success_equal-pay-day-2024", "text": "March 12 marks Equal Pay Day in the United States, a symbolic date representing the number of days women have to work into the current year just to make the same amount of money men made in the prior one. Put another way, to make 12 months\u2019 worth of a man\u2019s median wages, a woman has to work about 14.5 months. In dollars and cents, for every dollar a man earns, a woman is paid 84 cents, according to the National Committee on Pay Equity and the Equal Pay Today campaign. That\u2019s based on earnings data for full-time, year-round workers from the US Census in 2022, which was the most recent full-year data set available. If part-time workers and those not employed year-round are included, the gender pay gap is worse, at 78 cents on the dollar, said Deborah Vagins, national campaign director of Equal Rights Advocates and director of Equal Pay Today. The size of the actual wage gap between men and women will widen or narrow depending on age, level of education, choice of occupation and tenure, as well as race and ethnicity. The gender pay gap is typically widest when comparing the earnings of White men to Black, Hispanic or Native American women. And, generally speaking, the gap is narrower in a given job when men and women are in their early- to mid-20s (i.e., when they are new to the workforce and before children come along), and also when comparing wages by title, tenure and education level within a given field. But no matter how you slice and dice the data, there are very few scenarios in which women on average earn the same as men. Indeed, in its latest analysis of median weekly earnings last year by occupation, the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research found that women earned less than men not only in all 20 of the largest occupations for men but also in all 20 of the largest occupations for women. Among the largest occupations for women, the most egregious pay gaps were among financial managers (women earned 71% of every dollar a man earns), retail salesperson (72%), education and child care administrators (79%), administrative assistants (80%) and managers (81%). The narrowest gap was among cashiers, where women almost have pay parity (98%) with their male colleagues. Same old (and annoying) story every year While the overall gender pay gap has been narrowing over time \u2014 for example, Equal Pay Day in 2005 was April 19, a full five weeks later than this year\u2019s \u2014 the very fact that \ufeffsuch a gap exists at all in 2024 is a reminder that employers and society still have work to do in recognizing the value of women\u2019s contributions at work. \u201cThe gender wage gap is a national disgrace,\u201d said\u00a0Jamila Taylor, IWPR\u2019s president and CEO, in a statement. \u201cEven in professions typically dominated by women, men earn more for doing the same job. Equal pay for equal work has been the law of the land for more than a half-century, yet\u00a0women still cannot get fair treatment when it comes to employment and earnings. And it\u2019s worse for women of color, who face rampant racial discrimination in the workforce in addition to ongoing pay inequities.\u201d The good news is that there are now multiple efforts that may over time help reduce the problem. They include an increasing number of state-level pay transparency laws and bans on employers asking job candidates for their salary histories, which can help chronically underpaid women gain more of an equal footing when they apply for new jobs. There is also now a ban on federal government agencies asking job candidates\u2019 for their salary history and a proposed rule that would prohibit federal contractors from doing the same, as well as requiring them to post in their job ads the pay for given positions. But Vagins and others in the campaign for equal pay also want to see action at the federal legislative level, supporting two bills: the Salary Transparency Act and the Paycheck Fairness Act, which have been introduced in the US House and Senate multiple times. For instance, the Paycheck Fairness Act would, according to Equal Pay Today, \u201cbar retaliation against workers who voluntarily discuss or disclose their wages; close loopholes that have allowed employers to pay women less than men for the same work \u2026 [and] ensure women can receive the same robust remedies for sex-based pay discrimination that are currently available to those subjected to discrimination based on race and ethnicity.\u201d Absent such federal laws requiring all employers to make equal pay more of an imperative, Vagins said, achieving true pay parity for women will be slow in coming.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/12/success/equal-pay-day-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk", "text": "In a year of wild tech stories that has seen Elon Musk transform Twitter, cryptocurrency exchange FTX collapse and Silicon Valley Bank implode, this week\u2019s whiplash-inducing turmoil at OpenAI is among the most captivating. Sam Altman \u2014 the leader of one of the world\u2019s most influential AI companies, OpenAI, and perhaps the\u00a0most visible figure in the fledgling industry \u2014 was fired Friday night by the startup\u2019s directors in a surprise move. Less than five days later, he\u2019s back as the company\u2019s CEO, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. The series of extraordinary events unfolded just days after OpenAI held its\u00a0first-ever developer conference, where it laid out new, commercialized versions of its technology, including the option to customize its ChatGPT AI chatbot. If you\u2019re just catching up, here\u2019s what you missed from a week so incredible you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking the script could have been written by an early version of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Friday Around 3 p.m. ET, Altman joined a Google Meet call with most of OpenAI\u2019s board that had been convened by fellow co-founder and OpenAI chief scientist\u00a0Ilya Sutskever, during which Altman was fired and told that the news would soon be made public. Within the next half hour, the board also informed Greg Brockman, another co-founder and OpenAI president, that he would be removed from the board. Around 3:30 p.m. ET, OpenAI publicly announced that it had fired Altman over concerns that he was not always truthful with the board. The board said Mira Murati, the company\u2019s chief technology officer, would become interim CEO. OpenAI\u2019s strategic partners, including its biggest financial backer Microsoft, were also reportedly informed of Altman\u2019s ouster just minutes before the board\u2019s announcement. Hours after being fired, Altman posted on X that he \u201cloved working with such talented people\u201d and that he would have \u201cmore to say about what\u2019s next later.\u201d Brockman promptly quit. \u201cPlease don\u2019t spend any time being concerned. We will be fine,\u201d Brockman\u00a0said in a Friday post\u00a0on X. \u201cGreater things coming soon.\u201d A key factor in the CEO\u2019s firing was\u00a0tension between Altman, who favored developing AI\u00a0more aggressively, and members of the OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the unfolding events. Saturday Within 24 hours of Altman being fired, reports emerged that he and other ex-OpenAI loyalists were mulling plans for their own venture. OpenAI\u2019s board was also reportedly having second thoughts and considering asking the ousted CEO to return. Sunday By Sunday afternoon, Altman was\u00a0back at OpenAI\u2019s headquarters\u00a0\u2014 this time with a guest badge \u2014 to negotiate his potential return. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reportedly mediated the discussion. A 5 p.m. PT deadline was reportedly set for the board to agree to Altman\u2019s demands, including adding a seat for Microsoft, and reinstating him as CEO. But those talks broke down. As Sunday turned into Monday, Nadella tweeted that Altman, along with Brockman, would join Microsoft to run a new AI research group. At OpenAI, the group found a new interim CEO: Emmett Shear, the former CEO of Amazon\u2019s streaming service, Twitch. Murati would return to her role as OpenAI\u2019s chief technology officer. Monday In a post on X early Monday, Shear, who left his role at Twitch in March, described the chance to join OpenAI as \u201ca once-in-a-lifetime\u201d opportunity. He added that the company would hire an independent investigator to report on what happened in the lead-up to Altman\u2019s firing. But OpenAI employees were not convinced. More than 500 staffers signed an open letter calling on the company\u2019s board to resign and reinstate Altman and Brockman. They also threatened to follow the co-founders to Microsoft if their demands were not met. Altman posted on X, saying, \u201cwe have more unity and commitment and focus than ever before. we are all going to work together some way or other, and i\u2019m so excited. one team, one mission.\u201d The drama was far from over.\u00a0The Verge reported Monday afternoon\u00a0that Altman and Brockman could still return to OpenAI if the board members who fired him resign. And Nadella, speaking to CNBC, said he was \u201copen to both options\u201d when asked whether Altman would actually join Microsoft. \u201cLook, that is for the OpenAI board and management and the employees to choose,\u201d Nadella said. \u201cWe chose to explicitly partner with OpenAI and we want to continue to do so, and obviously, that depends on the people of OpenAI staying there or coming to Microsoft.\u201d Tuesday Altman\u00a0was reinstated late Tuesday as OpenAI\u2019s CEO, the company said on X. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman\u00a0wrote\u00a0that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his\u00a0post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it has backed with billions to bolster its ambitions in developing AI. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Nadella\u00a0said\u00a0on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "business"}}

Users must have owned those models between September 16, 2016, and January 3, 2023, and either complained to Apple regarding an issue, such as FaceTime, the loudspeaker, Siri or the voice memo app not working or paid for a related repair. Apple denied the devices had these issues and all allegations of wrongdoing, according to the Settlement Administration website. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The issue stemmed from the audio chip, which manages how sound comes out of the speakers or through headphones. In September 2016, Apple ditched its headphone jack on the iPhone 7 models to make way for better sound quality, a thinner design and superior water resistance.

But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019ll get smoother, at least right away \u2014 and some financial firms are preparing to handle any possible bumpiness. The current standard settlement cycle for broker-dealer transactions is \u201cT+2.\u201d That means that it takes two business days from when you buy a stock to when that transaction \u201csettles,\u201d or when the stock is officially transferred to the buyer\u2019s account and cash is delivered to the seller\u2019s account. That\u2019s been the norm since 2017. Starting May 28, that cycle will take just one business day, or \u201cT+1.\u201d \u201cFor everyday investors who sell their stock on a Monday, shortening the settlement cycle will allow them to get their money on Tuesday,\u201d Gary Gensler, chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said in a press release. \u201cIt will make our market plumbing more resilient, timely and orderly.\u201d These new rules will apply to stocks, bonds, municipal securities, exchange-traded funds, some mutual funds and limited partnerships that trade on an exchange. Broker-dealers and registered investment advisors will also have to follow new recordkeeping rules. Some investors say that a shorter cycle should help free up more liquidity in the market and reduce volatility in margins \u2014 the collateral traders have to show \u2014 since it reduces the chance of default before the transaction goes through. Clearinghouses, which sit between buyers and sellers, collect margins from traders as evidence that they can afford to make the transaction. \u201cAssuming everything goes well and we don\u2019t see any hiccups, the move towards T+1 will be an overall benefit to our ecosystem, institutional investors and retail [investors],\u201d said Rich Lee, head of program trading and execution strategy at Baird. Baird has had a T+1 committee in place since last summer to ensure such hiccups don\u2019t happen, Lee said. Employees have been in discussions with clients about how to assist them through the process. The company has also staffed up to handle their part in clearing trades with a shorter time frame. The shortened settlement cycle is partly in response to the 2021 meme stock frenzy, when investors on Reddit sent shares of GameStop and AMC Entertainment soaring to eye-popping heights in a short span of time. (Meme stocks typically trade less on fundamentals and more on social media frenzy.)  Robinhood in 2021 temporarily suspended trading of GameStop, AMC and other stocks on its platform, blaming in part the T+2 rule that pushed up collateral requirements imposed on brokers like Robinhood. Investors were left waiting for their trades and brokers with their cash locked up until the settlement, unable to allow more purchasing to ensure they had enough funds to cover the trades. \u201cThe existing two-day period to settle trades exposes investors and the industry to unnecessary risk and is ripe for change,\u201d Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev said in a February 2021 release. \u201cThere is no reason why the greatest financial system the world has ever seen cannot settle trades in real time.\u201d Boeing on track to meet FAA deadline to present quality control fixes Boeing will present its plan to fix quality problems with its assembly line to US regulators next week, the company said Thursday.

Discovery\u2019s TNT\u00a0network \u201csucks, plain and simple,\u201d\u00a0Charles Barkley\u00a0bluntly said Thursday. The former\u00a0NBA\u00a0star and\u00a0\u201cInside the NBA\u201d\u00a0co-host was speaking on\u00a0\u201cThe Dan Patrick Show\u201d\u00a0about the increasing likelihood that the network will soon lose the rights to air the league\u2019s games next year, a prospect that could mark the end of the beloved show on the\u00a0Turner\u00a0network. Barkley, who said he feels \u201cso bad for the people\u201d he works with, laid blame at the feet of the \u201cclowns\u201d atop WBD. \u201cThese people I work with, they screwed this thing up \u2014 clearly,\u201d Barkley unloaded. The host did little to hide his anger as he cited WBD boss\u00a0David Zaslav\u2019s\u00a0now-infamous 2022 comment that the company didn\u2019t \u201chave to have the NBA,\u201d suggesting the remark likely \u201cpissed\u201d off NBA commissioner\u00a0Adam Silver\u00a0and helped lead to the current situation. \u201cIt sucks for all of us,\u201d Barkley added. The uncertainty and fear voiced by Barkley comes as the NBA moves to renew its broadcast rights with media partners, seeking a significant increase in the cost to air the league\u2019s games. WBD, the parent company of CNN and the Turner networks, had an exclusive negotiating window with the NBA to renew its contract, but it expired last month without a deal, allowing other media companies to bid for the broadcast rights. Bloomberg\u2019s Lucas Shaw\u00a0reported Thursday night\u00a0that the NBA had asked WBD for $2.3 billion to secure the highly coveted rights, roughly $1 billion more than it reportedly pays under its current deal to air the games on TNT, its streaming service\u00a0Max, and other cable networks. During the negotiation, Zaslav \u201ctopped out around\u201d $2.1 billion, Shaw reported. \u201cThe league got up from the table and walked right into the arms of\u00a0Comcast\u00a0and\u00a0Amazon,\u201d Shaw wrote. NBCU, which appears poised to snatch the rights from WBD, offered $2.5 billion a year for the package of games,\u00a0The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Joe Flint,\u00a0Amol Sharma, and\u00a0Isabella Simonetti\u00a0first reported last month. The NBCU offer also includes airing the games on its broadcast network, something that WBD does not have, given that its linear television portfolio only includes cable channels. Wall Street has responded quite negatively to the possibility WBD, which has built a programming slate around the NBA, could lose the rights to air the games. When The WSJ first broke news about NBCU\u2019s bid, WBD\u2019s stock price plunged nearly 10% to an all-time low. The stock slightly recovered, but it is still hovering near historic lows, closing Thursday at $7.70 a share. Spokespeople for WBD and the NBA declined to comment on Thursday. But WBD executives have tried over the last several weeks to quell investor concerns. Zaslav said on a company earnings call that he remained \u201chopeful we will be able to reach an agreement that makes sense for both sides.\u201d While NBCU\u2019s bid far surpasses the current price WBD pays to air the games, WBD executives have repeatedly underscored that the company retains the right to match other offers, perhaps Amazon\u2019s. It\u2019s possible that Zaslav will be able to find another way to walk away from the intense negotiations with a deal for\u00a0some\u00a0games. But as the games slip out of WBD\u2019s hands, morale has taken an ugly hit at TNT, as evidenced by Barkley\u2019s candid comments. While WBD maintains the rights to the\u00a0NCAA March Madness\u00a0tournament, along with the\u00a0MLB,\u00a0NHL\u00a0and\u00a0NASCAR\u00a0\u2014 and\u00a0most recently\u00a0acquired\u00a0College Football Playoff\u00a0games from\u00a0ESPN\u00a0\u2014 the NBA remains crucial to the media conglomerate. It is, unquestionably, the crown jewel of WBD\u2019s sports portfolio. And TNT has built a programming slate around the NBA games, most notably the highly rated \u201cInside the NBA\u201d show. In fact, Barkley just signed a new, 10-year contract in 2023. Moreover, WBD struck a landmark deal with\u00a0Disney\u00a0and\u00a0Fox Corp.\u00a0earlier this year to launch\u00a0Venu, a forthcoming joint sports streamer. Losing the rights to NBA games could throw aspects of that business partnership into question. That\u2019s not to mention that WBD\u2019s flagship streaming service, Max, has been advertising live sports to consumers as a key differentiator from other platforms. Losing the NBA would be a big blow to that pitch. Gunnar Wiedenfels, WBD\u2019s chief financial officer, acknowledged this week at the\u00a0J.P. Morgan\u2019s\u00a0Technology, Media &\u00a0Communications\u00a0conference that \u201csports are a very important category\u201d for the company and it remains \u201cfully committed to a sports strategy.\u201d But Wiedenfels stressed the importance of financial restraint when inking such deals. \u201cWhat I also will say is we\u2019re always going to be disciplined,\u201d Wiedenfels said. \u201cIt\u2019s very easy with sports rights to burn a lot of money. And there\u2019s also an opportunity to to get your hands on some of the most emotional, most coveted products from an audience perspective. So, you\u2019ve got to be disciplined and think through all the scenarios.\u201d In other words, WBD is facing a major dilemma: Fork over much more to the NBA to try to match a deal on the table, or end the company\u2019s nearly-four decade relationship with the league.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/media/charles-barkley-tnt-nba-reliable-sources/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "business"}}
