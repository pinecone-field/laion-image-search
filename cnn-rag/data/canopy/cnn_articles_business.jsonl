{"id": "2024_06_06_media_alex-jones-assets-sandy-hook", "text": "Right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones on Thursday moved to liquidate his personal assets, agreeing to demands from the families of Sandy Hook victims whom he owes more than $1.5 billion in damages over his lies about the 2012 school massacre. The seismic move paves the way for a future in which Jones no longer owns Infowars, the influential conspiracy empire he founded in the late 1990s. Over the years, Jones has not only used the media company to poison the public discourse with vile lies and conspiracy theories, but also to enrich himself to the tune of millions of dollars. Prior to Thursday, Jones had resisted converting his personal bankruptcy into a Chapter 7 liquidation. But facing mounting legal pressure, he reversed course and caved to the demands of the Sandy Hook families, who have still not seen a penny from Jones since juries in Connecticut\u00a0and Texas\u00a0found him liable in 2022 for defamation and emotional distress. His lawyers said in a filing that there was \u201cno reasonable prospect for a successful reorganization\u201d and that continuing down the path would only result in additional expenses incurred by Jones. The legal maneuver ultimately \u201cmeans [Jones\u2019] ownership in Free Speech Systems is going to get sold,\u201d Avi Moshenberg, an attorney who represents some of the Sandy Hook families, told CNN on Thursday night, referencing the parent company of Infowars. \u201cConverting the case to Chapter 7 will hasten the end of these bankruptcies and facilitate the liquidation of Jones\u2019s assets, which is the same reason we have moved to convert his company\u2019s case to Chapter 7,\u201d Chris Mattei, another attorney representing Sandy Hook families, told CNN. Jones technically has not controlled the Infowars business for some time, given that Free Speech Systems has also filed for bankruptcy protection. The company\u2019s business has, thus, been under the supervision of a court appointed restructuring officer. A hearing is scheduled for next Friday to determine the fate of Free Speech Systems\u2019 bankruptcy. But regardless of what happens in that case, Thursday\u2019s legal move sets the stage for a court-appointed trustee to liquidate\u00a0Jones\u2019 personal assets, which includes his stake in Infowars. The liquidation of Jones\u2019 assets does not mean that Infowars will cease to exist. Several outcomes are possible. The court-appointed trustee could sell the business to another owner, for instance. A representative for Jones did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday night.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/media/alex-jones-assets-sandy-hook/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_06_07_business_depression-era-law-ftc-southern-glazers", "text": "Federal regulators are planning to use a\u00a0rarely enforced\u00a0law from the Great Depression to allege America\u2019s largest alcohol distributor is unfairly pricing wine and spirits, a person familiar with the matter told CNN. A looming\u00a0Federal Trade Commission\u00a0lawsuit against Southern Glazer\u2019s Wine and Spirits would be aimed at lowering costs for consumers \u2014 in this case on alcohol \u2014 and ensuring mom-and-pop shops have a level playing field against big chains, the source said. The case, which could be\u00a0risky, would represent the latest effort by Biden\u00a0administration\u00a0regulators to show they are taking action to lower costs and confront dominant companies. It would also be the latest aggressive step by\u00a0FTC Chair Lina Khan, who recently led the agency to\u00a0ban most employers from using noncompete clauses\u00a0and is probing a\u00a0Microsoft deal with an artificial intelligence startup. The latest battleground in the antitrust fight could be booze. Southern Glazer\u2019s, based in Miami and operating in 44 US states, is the largest wine and spirits distributor in the United States. The family-owned company distributes everything from Grey Goose vodka and Jim Beam bourbon to Yellow Tail wine. Abandoned antitrust law from 1936 The FTC lawsuit, previously reported by\u00a0Politico, could come in the next few weeks and would rely on the\u00a0Robinson-Patman Act of 1936, the source said. That Depression-era law prohibits suppliers from providing deeper discounts to large chains than to smaller stores. In other words, discounts to big-box chains must be available to mom-and-pop stores, too. At the time, the antitrust law was aimed at helping smaller grocers survive when A&P\u00a0and\u00a0other chains dominated with lower prices. However, an FTC lawsuit against Southern Glazer\u2019s today would be controversial\u00a0in part because the Robinson-Patman Act has rarely been enforced since the late 1980s. In fact, this would be the first time it\u2019s been invoked since 2000, when the\u00a0agency settled with spice company McCormick. \u201cIt\u2019s been a law since 1936. It\u2019s still a law on the books. We enforce the law,\u201d the source told CNN, adding that since the law hasn\u2019t been enforced some smaller stores have struggled to survive. \u201cIf you can\u2019t compete on price or come even close, you can\u2019t stay in business.\u201d The thinking is that if a major alcohol distributor is offering deeper discounts to, say,\u00a0Walmart or Target, that\u2019s unfair to the smaller stores and their shoppers. And if those stores don\u2019t exist, consumers are harmed from the lack of access and from the fact that the larger chains now face less competition on price. Could enforcement\u00a0backfire on shoppers? Yet critics of the Robinson-Patman Act argue that enforcement would backfire on consumers, causing big chains to raise prices because they lose access to deep discounts they currently enjoy. Favoring small businesses over large ones, critics argue, would\u00a0harm\u00a0consumers. Alden Abbott, a former FTC general counsel during the Trump administration, warned in a Forbes op-ed last month that the FTC should consider the \u201cmajor downside\u201d of Robinson-Patman Act (RPA) prosecutions. \u201cWhile perhaps cloaked in \u2018fairness,\u2019 a major RPA lawsuit could discourage business discounting at a time of public concern over excessively high prices,\u201d wrote Abbott, senior research fellow at George Mason University\u2019s Mercatus Center. The Antitrust Modernization Commission, a bipartisan commission created by Congress, concluded in 2007 that Congress should \u201cfinally repeal\u201d the Robinson-Patman Act because it \u201cappears antithetical to core antitrust principles.\u201d \u201cA successful revival of Robinson-Patman would more likely result in\u00a0higher\u00a0not lower prices,\u201d said Ed Schwartz, an antitrust partner with Reed Smith. However, that is hard to prove. Much of the debate is theoretical since the law hasn\u2019t been enforced in decades. \u201cThere is no empirical evidence that enforcement of the Robinson-Patman Act raises consumer prices,\u201d said Lee Hepner, senior counsel at the American Economic Liberties Project, a nonpartisan anti-monopoly advocacy group. While opponents of enforcing Robinson-Patman say consumers are helped by the big discounts large chains get, Hepner argued the opposite is true. \u201cPrice discrimination is a tool used by dominant corporations to enhance their market power,\u201d he said. \u201cThat market power leads to higher consumer prices.\u201d Chris Jones, chief government relations officer and counsel at the National Grocers Association, a national trade association for independent grocers, said enforcement of the Robinson-Patman Act by the FTC is \u201clong overdue.\u201d \u201cFor decades, antitrust enforcers have overlooked this statute, allowing dominant firms to use their size and market power to crush\u00a0main\u00a0street businesses and increase consumer costs,\u201d said Jones, leader of the Main Street Competition Coalition, an industry group that supports enforcement of the 1936 law. \u201cEnforcing the Robinson-Patman Act will help restore true price competition across the economy, benefiting consumers with more choices and lower prices for everyday essentials.\u201d A key test case in antitrust Both the FTC and Southern Glazer\u2019s declined to comment. However, a person familiar with the matter said Southern Glazer\u2019s discounts are available to all retailers where permitted by state law. The source added that there are no secret discounts going on and that the only reason a smaller store may not enjoy the same discount as a larger store is because they can\u2019t or won\u2019t take on the same volume. The FTC has not filed a lawsuit against Southern Glazer\u2019s,\u00a0and there is no guarantee the agency will pursue one. It\u2019s still possible that FTC commissioners vote against such a lawsuit. But if the lawsuit does go forward, it would represent a test case \u2014 and a complex one at that. One complicating factor is that the alcohol industry is already heavily regulated at the state level. There is a maze of state-level rules that dictate who can sell what booze to whom. That could make such a case a state\u2019s rights issue \u2013 and one where businesses argue consumers will be hurt. Schwartz, the Reed Smith lawyer, said a case against Southern Glazer\u2019s would reflect a shift in enforcement policy at the FTC under Khan away from the consumer welfare standards, where lower prices\u00a0are\u00a0almost always considered better for competition. The goal here would be to \u201ctry to level the playing field for small retailers who are trying to compete,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could think of it as much as a challenge to the mega-retailers as it is to the suppliers.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/business/depression-era-law-ftc-southern-glazers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_05_30_business_american-consumer-economic-engine", "text": "It\u2019s becoming tougher and tougher for Americans to carry on with their spending spree. Years of elevated inflation and the highest interest rates in almost a quarter century are wearing out the US consumer. Savings accumulated during the Covid-19 pandemic are drying up, borrowers continue to rack up debt and delinquencies are marching higher. Retailers say shoppers are fed up with rising prices and are changing their purchasing behavior. Americans power economic growth with their spending, and they\u2019re being buffeted from every direction. US consumers unleashed a tsunami of demand when the economy ascended from pandemic depths. That momentum persisted last year as Americans gladly opened their wallets, selling out high-profile concerts and breaking travel records, which also staved off a widely anticipated recession. Such exuberance is being kept alive by America\u2019s solid job market, with sub-4% unemployment, nearly two million job openings more than unemployed people seeking work and wages that are outpacing inflation. The job market is proving to be the US economy\u2019s saving grace, but it is unmistakable that Americans are feeling pinched. Once that shoe drops, it could cause an earthquake for the world\u2019s biggest economy. \u201cAs long as people stay employed, they\u2019ll continue to spend because it\u2019s hard to pull back dramatically without feeling like you\u2019re shortchanging yourself,\u201d Carol Schleif, chief investment officer at BMO Family Office, told CNN. \u201cBut consumers are being very selective now, and they will cut back if they have to.\u201d A slowdown according to economic data Given the barrage of economic hurdles facing consumers, economists are paying close attention for a turning point. Sales at US retailers and restaurants were unexpectedly flat in April, missing the 0.4% gain economists projected. Retail spending, which is adjusted for seasonal swings but not inflation, was also revised down for March. A second estimate of gross domestic product, released Thursday, showed that consumer spending was weaker in the first three months of the year than initially reported. Consumption, which accounts for about two-thirds of the US economy, advanced 2% in the first quarter, down from the 2.5% reflected in the first estimate. That resulted in gross domestic product overall to be revised down to a 1.3% annualized rate, compared to the 1.6% initially estimated. Economists polled by FactSet are expecting data to be released Friday to show that consumer spending slowed notably in April from March. But perhaps the most unsettling economic release that came in below economists\u2019 expectations was the employment report for April. Employers added just 175,000 jobs last month, a big miss from the 235,000 jobs economists projected in a FactSet poll. And instead of holding steady at 3.8%, as expected, the unemployment rate edged higher to 3.9%. The job market is humming along just fine for now, but for how much longer remains to be seen. It\u2019s unclear if the recent slate of disappointing figures means the economy will weaken further or rebound because one month\u2019s data \u2014 not even one quarter\u2019s \u2014 does not make a trend. Warnings from retailers Retail earnings have painted a mixed picture, but lower and middle-income customers are now pulling back. Walmart (WMT) saw customers across income brackets shop more frequently at the chain across the first three months of the year, including higher-income consumers buying groceries in a sign that consumers are squeezed. Other chains have seen similar signals. Lower-income consumers bought more private-label brands and $1 items at Dollar General during its latest quarter, that company said. Kohl\u2019s (KSS) stock plunged more than 20% Thursday after weak quarterly results, showing how middle-income customers have pulled back on non-essential clothing and discretionary merchandise at department stores. \u201cOur customers continue to be pressured by a number of economic factors, including high interest rates and inflation,\u201d Kohl\u2019s CEO Thomas Kingsbury said on a call with analysts on Thursday. \u201cOur middle income customer continues to be impacted.\u201d Target, Home Depot and Best Buy, which have been some of the strongest retailers in recent years, have taken a hit from the pullback in discretionary goods. Many retailers have slashed prices and ramped up discounts to try to boost demand.Still, there have been bright spots in the retail industry. TJX, the parent of TJ Maxx and Home Goods, has surged as consumers seek out bargains. And Abercrombie & Fitch, a 1990s mainstay, has tapped into consumer nostalgia to revitalize the brand. Economists were humbled last year when their bets that the economy would fall into a recession proved to be flat-out wrong, so the economy\u2019s resilience ought not to be underestimated. But the latest data and earnings results show that the economic landscape remains undeniably tough and it is putting Americans to the test.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/business/american-consumer-economic-engine/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_07_business_senators-unitedhealth-patient-data-hack", "text": "A bipartisan pair of senators is accusing a major health care firm that suffered a crippling cyberattack in February of not complying with federal law that requires patients be notified when their data is stolen. In a letter sent to\u00a0UnitedHealth Group CEO Andrew Witty this week, New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan and Tennessee Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn demanded that the health care giant \u201cassume full and immediate responsibility\u201d for giving patients and health providers information on the breach. Federal law known as the\u00a0Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) generally requires health care providers to notify people within 60 days of discovering a breach affecting their personal health data. The Department of Health and Human Services is already investigating whether UnitedHealth is compliant with HIPAA obligations to protect patient data. The department can\u2019t discuss ongoing investigations, an HHS spokesperson told CNN. HHS can use HIPAA to fine companies for failing to protect patient data. The department announced a $4.75 million settlement in February with a nonprofit hospital system in New York for \u201cdata security failures\u201d that the department said resulted in an employee stealing and selling patient data. But the cleanup from the ransomware attack on Change Healthcare, a UnitedHealth subsidiary, has been unusually messy and complicated compared to other ransomware attacks on the health sector. The hack paralyzed computers that Change Healthcare uses to process medical claims across the country. Health care providers were cut off from billions of dollars in payments, according to one hospital association, and some health clinics\u00a0were on the brink of bankruptcy\u00a0because they couldn\u2019t get paid. Witty told Congress last month that a third of Americans may have had their personal data stolen in the hack and that it would likely take \u201cseveral months\u201d before the company is able to identify and notify Americans who were affected. One reason for the lengthy notification process, he said, was that files on patients were compromised in the ransomware attack. In the aftermath of the hack, some health care providers were confused whether they or Change Healthcare were responsible for notifying patients that their data had been breached. On May 31, the HHS Office for Civil Rights clarified that health care providers can delegate that obligation to Change Healthcare. \u201cWe appreciate OCR\u2019s recent clarification that providers and other HIPAA covered entities can delegate their notice obligations to Change, which reiterated our previously stated preference to ease the reporting obligations of our customers,\u201d UnitedHealth spokesperson Eric Hausman\u00a0said in an emailed statement to CNN on Friday. \u201cAs a result, we are working with our customers to ensure the notification process meets their needs and satisfies legal obligations.\u201d The hack cast a spotlight on UnitedHealth\u2019s powerful role in the health care market. The company reported $371 billion in revenue last year. Change Healthcare handles one in three American patient records,\u00a0according\u00a0to the American Hospital Association. Optum, another UnitedHealth subsidiary, employs about 90,000 physicians. The UnitedHealth subsidiary hack, and\u00a0another\u00a0ransomware attack on one of the country\u2019s biggest hospital chains, has also increased pressure on Capitol Hill and in the White House to produce new regulations that require health care companies meet minimum cybersecurity standards. The Hassan-Blackburn letter is not the only inquiry that UnitedHealth faces in the Senate. Sen. Ron Wyden, the Oregon Democrat who chairs the finance committee, has called on the Federal Trade Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate UnitedHealth\u2019s cybersecurity practices. The FTC declined to comment, while an SEC spokesperson told CNN that the agency would respond directly to Wyden.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/business/senators-unitedhealth-patient-data-hack/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "business"}}

The document alleges that the defendants and Gadd told the \u201cbiggest lie in television history\u201d by claiming the story is true.

In an essay for Netflix, he said the situation was \u201cmessy\u201d and \u201ccomplicated,\u201d but he believed the story needed to be told. On Thursday, Gadd and Jessica Gunning, who plays Scott, appeared on NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d to talk about the thriller\u2019s huge success. \u201cIt\u2019s just had this sort of almost cross-cultural success that I never expected, because it\u2019s so singular and it\u2019s very idiosyncratic, it\u2019s very\u00a0London, and it\u2019s such an odd story, a weird traumatic story,\u201d Gadd said. He has yet to comment publicly on the court action. Gadd previously told UK newspaper The Guardian the story is \u201cvery emotionally true \u2026 But we wanted it to exist in the sphere of art, as well as protect the people it\u2019s based on.\u201d His repeated requests, however, for viewers to cease trying to find out the real-life identities of the figures in his story went unheard. Harvey\u2019s complaint alleges Netflix made no effort to confirm any of the purported facts in the show, including that Gadd\u2019s alleged stalker was sentenced to five years in prison for stalking. In the show, Gunning\u2019s character is also seen sexually assaulting Gadd. In the complaint, Harvey said within a few days of the show airing she began to receive messages, including death threats, identifying her as Gadd\u2019s alleged stalker.

Of course, it\u2019s not that the league was dormant before Clark got there, it\u2019s that most of the mainstream press weren\u2019t paying attention. The impact of Clark\u2019s arrival is undeniable. But McAfee and the four men flanking him in\u00a0his\u00a0Indiana\u00a0studio are\u00a0not the best people to lead that conversation on one of the most influential sports networks in America. McAfee\u2019s right that the ground is shifting for women\u2019s basketball \u2014 it\u2019s one of those pivotal moments when journalists and analysts would normally call up an expert or two and try to absorb some of the complexities of the situation. Instead, the male commentariat have\u00a0done too much talking and not enough listening. Clark, a White, straight phenom, has become male sportscasters\u2019 proxy in a league built primarily by Black and LGBTQ athletes whom the mainstream felt fine skimming over in the past. And in covering the league, they\u2019re relying on outdated tropes about how women are supposed to behave. Charles Barkley recently called women \u201cpetty\u201d for being rough on Clark. \u201cY\u2019all should be thanking that girl for getting y\u2019all ass\u2019 private charters, all the money and visibility she brings into the WNBA,\u201d he said on TNT\u2019s \u201cInside the NBA.\u201d (TNT and CNN are both owned by Warner Bros. Discovery.) As the journalist Victoria Uwumarogie wrote in an essay for Essence this week, \u201cthe expectations Barkley has of men are vastly different from those he has for women, and that\u2019s similar to many of the other men who are, all of a sudden, WNBA experts now that Clark is in the league.\u201d Clark isn\u2019t in Iowa anymore. She\u2019s \u201cgoing up against women who\u2019ve been fighting for their just dues for years, including veterans and champions who were putting the league on the map before she stepped on the court,\u201d Uwumarogie writes. The league those women built has always been a physical one, a fact that Clark herself acknowledged in a postgame news conference. And that\u2019s the point basketball analyst Monica McNutt was making on ESPN\u2019s \u201cFirst Take\u201d\u00a0Monday. \u201cThere are so many layers in this conversation,\u201d McNutt says, while batting down the two men on screen who try to talk over her. \u201cThe prevailing sentiment for folks that are just joining the WNBA and following women\u2019s sports is\u00a0unfair to the women of this league \u2026 who have laid the groundwork for Caitlin Clark to come in and now take it to the next level.\u201d But host\u00a0Stephen A. Smith got all up in a huff when the criticism made him uncomfortable.\u00a0In response, Smith got defensive, asking, \u201cWho talks about the WNBA \u2026 who talks about women\u2019s sports more than \u2018First Take?\u2019\u201d McNutt\u00a0returned with a dagger: \u201cStephen A., respectfully, with your platform, you could have been doing this three years ago if you wanted to.\u201d The conversation fell apart, and the network went to commercial. Much like Clark, the mainstream sports media is new to the WNBA. And like any rookie season, it\u2019s been a rude awakening, full of stumbles and setbacks. Clark is learning how to navigate it. Let\u2019s hope the media can up its game, too.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/media/caitlin-clark-media-coverage/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_07_tech_ai-regulation-nightcap", "text": "Some of the biggest companies on the planet have staked their futures, and ours, on the proliferation of AI, a technology so complex and dangerous its own inventors are begging them to slow down. That sure\u00a0seems\u00a0like the kind of thing US lawmakers might want to regulate on a level comparable to the federal government\u2019s strict oversight of, say, narcotics or cigarettes, or even TikTok. But Congress hasn\u2019t passed a single bill on AI, and a bipartisan \u201croadmap\u201d released last month is far from certain to be taken during an election year. (Which is ironic, given that one of the priorities of the roadmap is making sure AI doesn\u2019t, like, hijack the American electoral process.) Unsurprisingly, then, we\u2019re relying on the understaffed, underfunded Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department to try to keep Big Tech in line through enforcement. See here: Antitrust officials at the FTC and the Justice Department are nearing a final agreement this week on how to jointly oversee AI giants including Microsoft, Google, Nvidia, OpenAI and others, my colleague\u00a0Brian Fung reports. The agreement suggests a broad crackdown is coming, and fast. But likely not fast enough. The proverbial AI horse has left the barn, and it\u2019s running wild. Nvidia, a chipmaking company few people had heard of even a year ago, recently joined the $3 trillion club, briefly surpassing Apple as the second most valuable publicly traded company in the United States. Microsoft remains the No. 1 company by market cap, a feat it owes to its investments in ChatGPT maker OpenAI. All of that money was able flood in because the notoriously tech-challenged lawmakers in Washington have been largely asleep at the wheel. (European officials, meanwhile, formally adopted the world\u2019s first standalone AI law this spring, a full five years after rules were proposed.) The money part can\u2019t be overstated. Until recently, AI was a largely academic subject rarely discussed outside of Silicon Valley. Then OpenAI blew the door off its hinges by unleashing ChatGPT to the world, setting off a gold rush that\u2019s become the hottest play on Wall Street. And that is exactly what a group of current and former OpenAI employees are now warning about. \u201dAI companies have strong financial incentives to avoid effective oversight,\u201d they wrote\u00a0in an open letter\u00a0this week. \u201cSo long as there is no effective government oversight of these corporations, current and former employees are among the few people who can hold them accountable to the public. Yet broad confidentiality agreements block us from voicing our concerns, except to the very companies that may be failing to address these issues.\u201d In other words, we\u2019re counting on the newly wealthy tech nerds to self-regulate. What could go wrong?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/tech/ai-regulation-nightcap/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_07_tech_south-korea-samsung-workers-strike-intl-hnk", "text": "A labor union at Samsung Electronics in South Korea said many workers went on strike Friday, marking the first such walkout in the smartphone and chipmaking giant\u2019s 55-year history. The Nationwide Samsung Electronics Union (NSEU) said last week that its 28,000 members \u2014 just under a quarter of the company\u2019s total workforce in the country \u2014 would stage a one-day strike on June 7, following failed negotiations over pay and bonus arrangements. The union asked its members to take a day off on Friday, which falls between a public holiday on Thursday and the weekend. Son Woomok, a union leader, told CNN that \u201cmany employees used their annual leave today,\u201d and at one site \u201call workers had taken leave so replacement personnel were deployed.\u201d He did not provide other details. He had previously said many NSEU members work for Samsung\u2019s flagship semiconductor unit. That division is trying to regain its former status as a top semiconductor company, according to Reuters, which says Samsung has fallen behind its competitors SK Hynix\u00a0and Micron Technology\u00a0in delivering chips used in artificial intelligence (AI) processors. A Samsung spokesperson told CNN that, \u201cthere is no impact on production and management activities\u201d as a result of the one-day walkout. \u201cToday\u2019s annual leave use rate is lower than last year\u2019s Memorial Day holiday\u2019s annual leave use rate,\u201d the spokesperson added. The world\u2019s biggest memory chipmaker has had a rough few years. A historic\u00a0shortage\u00a0of computer chips during the Covid\u00a0pandemic\u00a0was followed by falling demand last year as consumer appetite for electronics remained weak because of global economic uncertainty. But things are looking up for the company because of the AI boom. It is optimistic about a resurgence in demand for mobile devices this year, particularly with the rollout of new products, such as AI-powered smartphones. Last month, Samsung reported a more than\u00a0tenfold rise\u00a0in first-quarter operating profit amid forecasts of high demand for AI and high-end chips, an area in which it competes with Intel (INTC) and Taiwan\u2019s TSMC. The vast majority of the world\u2019s advanced microchips are made in just two places: Taiwan and South Korea. Taiwan\u2019s industry is larger and more dominant, something South Korea is keen to challenge.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/tech/south-korea-samsung-workers-strike-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_07_economy_bad-news-in-good-jobs-report", "text": "At a time when Americans and the\u00a0Federal Reserve\u00a0are clamoring for clear-cut data about the state of the\u00a0economy, Friday\u2019s\u00a0jobs\u00a0report was much more opaque than everyone had hoped. While \u201cit\u2019s hard not to like a lot of\u00a0jobs,\u201d as economist Dean Baker told CNN, other contents of the May\u00a0jobs\u00a0report add to the pile of unwelcome economic news that has included slower GDP growth, a pullback in some spending and a rise in credit card delinquencies. \u201cThe good news is we saw the explosion in payrolls. The bad news is the rise in\u00a0unemployment\u00a0with an acceleration in wage gains,\u201d Diane Swonk, chief economist with KPMG, told CNN. Unemployment rose The\u00a0unemployment\u00a0rate rose to 4% from 3.9%. It\u2019s the first time in more than two years that the jobless rate is not below 4%. The rise in unemployment can be traced to the findings of the household survey (one of two surveys that feed into the monthly jobs report). Compared to the establishment survey that showed the robust 272,000 net gain in jobs, the household survey faltered. Employment as measured by household survey responses fell by 408,000 in May from April; the number of people in the labor force fell by 250,000; the labor force participation rate inched down to 62.5% from 62.7%, Gus Faucher, PNC chief economist, noted Friday. \u201cJobs declined in the household survey, but that number is more volatile than the employer survey,\u201d he wrote. And while unemployment rose only slightly, by 0.1 percentage points, it landed at a number   that could have a psychological component. \u201c4% is thought of as a magical number \u2014 a number below which participation rises, below which we tend to see employment rates increase faster for women and for minorities,\u201d Julia Pollak, chief economist of ZipRecruiter, told CNN earlier this week. \u201cEmployers in a tight labor market, they have to do extraordinary things; they have to cast a wider net; they have to actively recruit non-traditional candidates; they have to offer more attractive job conditions, more flexibility, think about installing air conditioning in their trucks or offering a bus to employees. So, it is kind of a magical number,\u201d Pollak said. Wage growth also rose Stronger-than-expected wage gains for the month pushed up average hourly earnings to 4.1% over the past year, reversing a monthslong trend of cooling. \u201cThe\u00a0Fed\u00a0doesn\u2019t directly target wages; but where the wages picked up are in the [service sector] areas where we\u2019ve seen the most\u00a0inflation,\u201d Swonk said. That\u2019s in the service sector, everything from personal care services, dry cleaning, cleaning and home maintenance and vehicle maintenance, she said. \u201cAnd that is something that is hard for the\u00a0Fed, because in order for some of the increases we\u2019re seeing in the service sector, we need to see offset in goods prices in order to bring\u00a0inflation\u00a0down,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you need a lot of that consistently to deal with stickier\u00a0inflation\u00a0that we\u2019re seeing in the service sector; and, unfortunately, wages matter more in particular areas where\u00a0inflation\u00a0has gotten stickiest.\u201d Weak spots are appearing in the labor market A report released Thursday showed that fewer job cuts were announced in May than both the month and year before. That\u2019s really good news for Americans and recession worrywarts, but the same report also noted that hiring announcements slumped as well. Through May of this year, US-based employers have announced plans to hire 50,833 workers, marking the lowest total for the first five months of the year since 2014, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas data released Thursday. \u201cThe typical churn in a healthy labor market appears to be stalling,\u201d Andrew Challenger, senior vice president of the outplacement and business research firm, said in a statement. While hirings have retreated, and job openings have declined, the number of layoffs remain low. Weekly jobless claims remain below pre-pandemic levels, and Challenger\u2019s own report shows a 20% drop in job cut announcements as compared to May 2023. \u201cThere are ample signs that the heat in the labor market over the past few years largely has been removed,\u201d Wells Fargo economists Sarah House and Mike Pugliese, wrote Friday. The overall economy is slowing Last week\u2019s gross domestic product report, which measures all the services and goods produced in the economy, showed a 1.3% annualized rate. That\u2019s down from the 1.6%\u00a0reflected in the first estimate. The lower pace of economic expansion was largely due to a downward revision to consumer spending, which accounts for about 70% of the US economy. Spending advanced 2% in the January-through-March period, compared to the initial rate of 2.5%. The latest GDP report also showed that corporate profits, before taxes, fell 0.6% in the first quarter, the first decline in a year and down sharply from the 4.1% increase in the prior three-month period. Still, while most corporate earnings results this quarter proved decent, companies indicated it\u2019s become increasingly difficult for them to pass on costs to consumers.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/economy/bad-news-in-good-jobs-report/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "business"}}

You can sign up\u00a0right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link. Roaring Kitty could soon face some roaring regulation. Keith Gill, the \u201cRoaring Kitty\u201d meme stock investor who last month revived frenzied trading of GameStop and AMC Entertainment shares, revealed in a Reddit post on Sunday that he had bought nearly $116 million worth of GameStop stock. The screenshot also showed he bought 120,000 call options with a $20 strike price. That means that Gill has the right to purchase 12 million shares of GameStop at $20 apiece by a set expiration date. GameStop shares closed Wednesday at $46.55 a share, more than double the price locked in by those options. A screenshot on Monday revealed that he made $54 million worth of gains on paper during just one trading session. Gill posted a fresh image on Thursday showing that he has not sold any of his GameStop position since the Monday screenshot and that his holding is now worth more than $500 million. CNN has not been able to independently confirm the screenshots. Gill\u2019s return to social media sent meme stocks like GameStop and AMC Entertainment soaring, reminiscient of the frenzy that swept markets in 2021. Meme stocks are shares of companies with a cult following that tend to see wide swings based on their popularity on social media rather than their fundamentals. The apparent staggering value of his portfolio, along with the large trading volumes of GameStop and AMC Entertainment shares in recent weeks, has brought into question whether Gill\u2019s actions require regulatory scrutiny. Gill hasn\u2019t explicitly told anyone to buy GameStop shares or that he thinks it\u2019s headed to the moon. He has communicated exclusively by posting memes, gifs, short video clips and screenshots of his portfolio. It\u2019s unclear if it even is Gill behind those posts. But Wall Street is still taking notice. The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that trading platform E*Trade, from which the screenshots appear to originate, is weighing removing Gill. The Journal also reported that Gill bought a \u201clarge volume\u201d of GameStop options before he posted on X in May for the first time in three years. Jay Woods, chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets, said that Gill\u2019s activity could be considered unethical. But Woods doesn\u2019t believe it\u2019s criminal, especially considering that the trader hasn\u2019t urged anyone to buy the stock \u2014 or really said anything at all. Morgan Stanley, which owns E*Trade, declined to comment for this story. Gill did not respond to requests for comment. To be sure, Gill isn\u2019t the first trader to inspire copycats. Warren Buffett is famously one such investor whose holdings are closely watched: Berkshire Hathaway, of which Buffett is chief executive, in May disclosed a stake worth roughly $6.7 billion in Chubb, sending the insurance firm\u2019s stock higher. But Chubb shares have risen just 4% since Buffett\u2019s stake was revealed. In comparison, shares of GameStop and AMC Entertainment have surged 167% and 99%, respectively, since Gill\u2019s return to social media. \u201cWould I compare Keith Gill to Warren Buffett? No, but [Gill\u2019s] influence is very similar. People want to be riding his coattails,\u201d said Woods. The Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into GameStop call options trading activity around the time of Gill\u2019s social media posts as concerns swirl internally that his trading activity could be considered manipulation, according to the Journal. An SEC spokesperson told CNN that it \u201cdoes not comment on the existence or nonexistence of a possible investigation.\u201d The Massachusetts securities division is probing Gill\u2019s trading activities, a spokesperson for Massachusetts Secretary of State Bill Galvin told CNN, while declining to comment further. It\u2019s unclear whether any regulatory action could quell Gill\u2019s staunch supporters or embolden them even more. Traders who helped stoke the 2021 meme stock frenzy touted a story of the underdog Main Street\u2019s victory against tyrannical Wall Street: Retail investors bid up shares of GameStop and other meme stocks, leading to steep losses for hedge funds that made trades based on the assumption their prices would drop. Any regulatory backlash against Gill has the potential to create a similar narrative this time around. In a surprise move, GameStop brought forward its first quarter earnings to Friday from next Tuesday. The video game retailer recorded a loss of $32.3 million, slightly better than the $50.5 million loss the prior year. First-quarter sales slipped to $0.9 billion, from $1.2 billion the year before. The company could be trying to get ahead of a livestream on the Roaring Kitty YouTube channel slated to air at 12 pm ET on Friday. Wall Street will be tuning in not just for the entertainment but also clues about Gill\u2019s next moves and their possible implications for trading regulations. \u201cThere are ramifications, because people want to know exactly what we can and can\u2019t do online,\u201d said Woods. \u201cThese [market] moves are not normal moves.\u201d Interest rates are coming down in Europe. The Fed won\u2019t follow yet The European Central Bank cut interest rates Thursday, moving before the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England to lower borrowing costs as inflation recedes following years of rate hikes, reports my colleague Hanna Ziady. The first ECB rate cut in nearly five years takes the benchmark rate in the 20 countries that use the euro down to 3.75% from an all-time high of 4%, where it had stood since September. The move will bring some relief to companies and consumers, many of whom have felt the financial strain of the rapid run-up in interest rates since late 2021. But the ECB cautioned that the fight to control price rises wasn\u2019t completely over yet and that it wasn\u2019t yet committed to further rate cuts. \u201cDespite the progress over recent quarters, domestic price pressures remain strong as wage growth is elevated, and inflation is likely to stay above target well into next year,\u201d the central bank said in a statement. Speaking to journalists, ECB President Christine Lagarde \u2014 who donned a necklace in the shape of the words \u201cIn charge\u201d \u2014 emphasized that the central bank would continue to follow \u201ca data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach.\u201d \u201cWe are not precommitting to a particular rate path,\u201d she said.

Microsoft\u2019s AI deal under federal investigation The Federal Trade Commission is investigating a recent Microsoft deal with artificial intelligence startup Inflection, according to a person familiar with the matter, as US antitrust regulators ramp up scrutiny of the red-hot AI industry. The investigation comes as antitrust officials at the FTC and the Justice Department are nearing final agreement this week on how to jointly oversee AI giants such as Microsoft, Google, Nvidia, OpenAI and others, two people familiar with the matter told CNN. That agreement, which is still being finalized, would appoint the Department of Justice as the lead investigator of Nvidia, while the FTC would take responsibility for investigating Microsoft and OpenAI, the people said. Any investigations would focus on whether the companies have used their dominant positions in the AI industry to harm competition, reports my colleague Brian Fung. The FTC probe into Microsoft, meanwhile, concerns whether the company\u2019s investment in Inflection constituted an acquisition that Microsoft failed to disclose to the government, one of the people said. In March, Microsoft announced it had hired Inflection\u2019s co-founders and a number of its staff to lead its Copilot program, and Inflection said its AI model would be hosted on Microsoft\u2019s cloud platform. As part of that deal, Microsoft was said to have paid $650 million to Inflection. Microsoft, Inflection, Google and OpenAI didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.

{"id": "2024_03_01_tech_aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl", "text": "A London-based technology company is looking to \u201cdemocratize\u201d talent-identification and scouting in soccer using a mobile app. Free to download and available globally, the aiScout app allows aspiring soccer stars to enter virtual trials for professional clubs by uploading self-recorded footage of themselves completing a series of drills. It offers 75 exercises, designed to test a range of skills, with videos showing users how to complete them. Performances are automatically scored by artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The data can then be accessed by clubs, allowing their scouts to peruse scores for viable talent, honing their search with a variety of filters; from age and gender to position on the pitch. The app currently has two English Premier League (EPL) partners, Chelsea and Burnley, and clubs can tailor their in-app trials to meet specific needs and set their own benchmarks by having their academy players complete the same drills. \u201cWe\u2019re putting that data up front to make better use of [the scouts\u2019] time,\u201d said Richard Felton-Thomas, chief operating officer of ai.io, the company behind the app. \u201cTo say [to scouts], \u2018Go over to this place today because there\u2019s three players in that game that are all actually beating your Chelsea standard\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s going to be the best use of your time.\u2019\u201d It already appears to be working for some. Ben Greenwood had never had a trial with a professional club until he downloaded the app in 2019. After uploading footage of himself, the 17-year-old landed a trial with Chelsea, becoming the first user of the app to get a trial with a pro club. He signed a contract\u00a0with EPL team Bournemouth\u00a0in 2021. \u2018It\u2019s more about evolution\u2019 Having beta-tested in with players spanning 125 countries, Greenwood among them, 135 players have been trialed or signed by pro clubs or national teams through the app \u2014 which fully launched in September 2023 \u2014 according to Felton-Thomas. Just over 100,000 players make up the current database, but with over 100 clubs lined up to join Chelsea and Burnley, as well as a multi-year partnership with Major League Soccer in the US announced last May, Felton-Thomas projects user numbers to surge into the millions as the operation ramps up this year. Felton-Thomas said the \u201clion\u2019s share\u201d of its income comes from charging clubs a license fee to run the platform. Annual fees vary depending on the size of the club and the tools they require, ranging from six figures for \u201ctier one\u201d sides like Chelsea, to thousands of pounds for clubs lower down the footballing pyramid. The use of smart technology in sport continues to expand, including\u00a0AI commentary tools and wearable tech for elite athletes. The global market for sports analytics, valued at\u00a0$2.7 billion\u00a0in 2023, is projected to grow 22% by the end of the decade, according to market research firm Grand View Research. Should soccer talent scouts be concerned about being edged out by the arrival of AI in their industry?

{"id": "2022_04_27_business_diamonds-manmade-demand", "text": "It\u2019s proposal season, and engagements are on the rise. So are factory-made diamond sales. Not that you\u2019d know the difference. Man-made diamonds look the same as naturally occurring ones. The only noticeable difference is the price tag. \u201cThe result is really stunning,\u201d said Edahn Golan, an independent diamond industry analyst. He said March data showed the number of engagement rings sold that featured a manufactured diamond jumped 63% compared to last year, while the number of engagement rings sold with a natural diamond declined 25% in the same period. Going back by another month, to February, the data showed the number of rings sold with lab diamonds that month surged even more, to 80% compared to a year earlier while the number fell by 13% for natural diamond engagement rings.  \u201cThe big fear in the natural diamonds industry is that consumers will start accepting lab-grown diamonds in engagement rings,\u201d he said. Too late. \u201cIt\u2019s actually happening.\u201d  Tide is shifting Why are consumers flocking to man-made diamonds? Cost is the most obvious reason. The average retail price of the most popular one carat round man-made diamond for an engagement ring in March was $2,318, Golan said. \u201cThis is substantially less \u2013 as much as 73% cheaper \u2013 than a natural diamond of the same size, cut and clarity as the man-made diamond, which would cost $8,740,\u201d he said. Plus, the lower cost allows couples to buy a bigger stone.  \u201cA lab diamond is a real diamond, but maybe it took a few weeks to make it,\u201d said Golan. \u201cNatural diamonds were formed over 800 million to three billion years and there isn\u2019t an infinite supply of them.\u201d  This makes natural diamonds quite a bit more expensive, and prices are likely to rise as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has tightened the supply chain for natural raw diamonds. The sanctions directly target Alrosa, partly owned by the Russian government, which the US government identified as the world\u2019s largest diamond mining company, accounting for 28% of global diamond output. Man-made diamonds are also becoming popular as consumers are more aware and educated about them, said Dan Moran, a third-generation diamond expert and owner of LA-based fine jeweler Concierge Diamonds. Moran said the typical buyer of man-made diamonds is typically younger than 40 and very budget conscious. Mined diamonds have a controversial history that\u2019s tied to the use of child labor in some African diamond mines as well as sales of illegally-traded \u201cconflict diamonds\u201d that fund conflict in war-torn areas. Among Millennials and Gen Z, their eco-conscious mindset and ethical concerns about natural diamond sourcing is another factor influencing their preference for non-traditional engagement rings, according to a report from wedding planning website The Knot. Small but growing share of the diamond market Although its slice is growing, the market share for man-made diamonds remains relatively small. Currently, about 7% of the specialty diamond jewelry market is represented by man-made diamonds, up from 3% in 2020, said Golan.  Some major jewelry retailers are driving the effort to take man-made diamonds mainstream. In 2021, the world\u2019s largest jewelry company, Pandora\n            \n                (PANDY), made a major shift by announcing it would stop using mined diamonds and would swap to lab-created diamonds in its jewelry.  Pandora said it\u2019s instituting the change as part of an effort to sell sustainable jewelry, and also because consumers increasingly are asking for it. Signet,\n            \n                (SIG) the largest jewelry company in the United States (which owns Zales, Kay Jewelers and Jared chains) called out the popularity of lab diamond jewelry in its March earnings call with analysts. Calling it a \u201cfast-growing category\u201d in its jewelry portfolio, Signet CEO Virginia Drosos told analysts that lab-created diamonds are among the big jewelry trends she expects this year.  The company said it has expanded its man-made bridal jewelry selection in both its Zales and Kay Jewelers stores in response to the increased demand.  Fine jewelry brand Charles and Colvard, which makes lab-created diamonds, said consumers don\u2019t just want to look good with the jewelry they are wearing, they also want to feel good about it. \u201cAs the momentum for conscious consumerism grows, the surge towards lab grown diamonds isn\u2019t surprising,\u201d said Don O\u2019Connell, president and CEO of Charles & Colvard. \u201c[Consumers] want to know the origins of their stones and be reassured they\u2019re conflict-free. They\u2019re embracing the choice to purchase a piece of fine jewelry that aligns with their values.\u201d Lab-grown diamond brand VRAI said the pandemic, too, has sparked attention and action toward social and environmental issues. It said consumers are being more thoughtful and reassessing their purchasing habits, as well as the companies and industries they are supporting. There is, however, one important consideration for anyone buying lab-created diamonds: Man-made diamonds have little resale value.  So while you may not be able to tell a natural diamond from a factory made variety, someone with a trained eye can, said Golan. Once a stone is identified as a factory diamond, even though you paid a lot less for it, you also won\u2019t get much for it.  But the value of a ring isn\u2019t just monetary. \u201cAs a professional in the industry, I am asked all the time by people about what I think about a ring they have,\u201d said Moran, of Concierge Jewelers. \u201cI always say, if you love it, be happy with it. An engagement ring is a symbol of commitment and enduring love.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/27/business/diamonds-manmade-demand/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_22_media_ronna-mcdaniel-nbc", "text": "NBC News on Friday announced that it had hired Ronna McDaniel, the former Republican National Committee chair who has repeatedly\u00a0attacked the network and its journalists,\u00a0assailed the\u00a0news\u00a0media as \u201cfake news\u201d and promoted false claims around the 2020\u00a0vote,\u00a0as an on-air commentator\u00a0ahead of the 2024 presidential election. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be a more important moment to have a voice like Ronna\u2019s on the team,\u201d Carrie Budoff Brown, senior vice president of politics at NBC News, said in a memo\u00a0to staff. McDaniel exited the RNC earlier this month after leading the organization since 2016. During her time as chair, McDaniel repeatedly attacked the press, which has become increasingly popular in Republican circles over the last several years as Donald Trump demonizes journalists and news institutions. McDaniel echoed many such attacks, labeling the press as \u201cfake news\u201d and calling the media \u201ccorrupt.\u201d At times, she even targeted NBC News\u00a0and MSNBC\u00a0with dishonest attacks. In 2019, for instance, McDaniel accused Richard Engel, NBC News\u2019 chief foreign correspondent, of \u201cactively cheering for an economic downturn.\u201d \u201cHow can NBC let him keep his job when he\u2019s made his bias so clear?\u201d McDaniel asked. McDaniel has a lengthier history attacking the progressive cable news channel MSNBC, which she will appear on in her new role. In recent years, she has repeatedly attacked the channel for \u201cspreading lies\u201d and blasted those she described as the network\u2019s \u201cprimetime propagandists.\u201d An NBC spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment about her attacks on the news media and NBC. In her role as RNC chief, McDaniel also fanned the flames of election denialism after the 2020 presidential contest. McDaniel was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d The Michigan Department of State\u2019s office condemned her claims of supposed voter fraud in the wake of the election, stating they had \u201cno merit.\u201d\u00a0The state\u2019s \u201celections were conducted fairly, effectively and transparently and are an accurate reflection of the will of Michigan voters,\u201d it said in a\u00a0detailed fact check\u00a0posted online. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Chris Wallace last year, McDaniel defended her claims of voting \u201cirregularity\u201d in the election. \u201cI think saying that there were problems with 2020 is very real. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s election denying,\u201d McDaniel told Wallace. \u201cI\u2019m from Wayne County. We had a woman send a note saying I\u2019m being told to backdate ballots. We had to look into that. That\u2019s deeply concerning. When you have friends who are poll-watching and being kicked out, that\u2019s deeply concerning. We have every right to look at that.\u201d In the interview,\u00a0Wallace pressed McDaniel if she believed Biden legitimately won the election. \u201cI think there were lots of problems with 2020. Ultimately, he won the election\u00a0but there were lots of problems with the 2020 election,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think he won it fair. I don\u2019t. I\u2019m not going to say that.\u201d NBC\u2019s hiring of McDaniel, however, plays into a recent trend at the\u00a0network\u2019s outlets, which has seemingly softened its stance on Trump as he inches toward the Republican nomination for president. Earlier this month, CNBC hosted Trump for a lengthy phone interview in which the network\u2019s anchors allowed him to peddle lies and conspiracy theories on air\u00a0without scrutiny. MSNBC has even started carrying Trump\u2019s remarks live on television, a practice that the network boasted for years it would not do. Star host Rachel Maddow, who has said carrying Trump\u2019s lies\u00a0on the air\u00a0is dangerous, even objected to the network broadcasting a recent speech from the presumptive Republican nominee, calling it \u201cirresponsible.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/22/media/ronna-mcdaniel-nbc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "business"}}

The probe is yet another complication for the social media platform, which is already facing the threat of a potential US ban or a forced divestment from its Chinese parent company. The sources said that the FTC is probing TikTok over an alleged violation of the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection rule, which requires companies to notify parents and obtain consent before collecting data from children under 13. The agency is also investigating whether TikTok violated a portion of the FTC Act that prohibits \u201cunfair or deceptive\u201d business practices, the sources said, in denying that TikTok user data could be accessed by individuals in China. The FTC could bring a suit against TikTok or settle with the company in the coming weeks, according to one of the sources. Politico reported news of the probe earlier. When asked about the investigation, FTC Director of Public Affairs Douglas Farrar replied: \u201cNo comment.\u201d TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The FTC probe comes as TikTok faces an existential threat in the US. Earlier this month, a bipartisan group in the US House of Representatives voted to pass a law forcing TikTok to be sold by ByteDance or face a ban from US app stores. The bill is now before the Senate, and President Joe Biden has said he would sign it if it gets to his desk. Senate leaders, however, have indicated they are taking a deliberate approach \u2014\u00a0which could lead to delays or even potentially doom the House bill. The short-form video company, owned by Chinese firm ByteDance, has denied assertions that its app poses a national security threat to US citizens. TikTok, which does not operate in China, has said that the Chinese government has never accessed US user data. Cybersecurity experts say Chinese laws require ByteDance to cooperate with that country\u2019s intelligence demands\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a fact that, given ByteDance\u2019s ownership of TikTok, could hypothetically put US user data at risk. To address that issue, TikTok has taken steps to store its US user data on cloud servers controlled by US tech giant Oracle and established internal protocols limiting access by non-US employees. TikTok acknowledged to Congress in 2022 that employees based in China could access US user data, following a report that year by BuzzFeed News that ByteDance employees had accessed that information on multiple occasions. TikTok CEO Shou Chew, in his first appearance before Congress last year, also acknowledged that several ByteDance employees were fired for spying on certain US journalists as part of a \u201cmisguided attempt\u201d to hunt down leakers within the company.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/ftc-tiktok-probe-privacy-and-security/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_media_australia-esafety-drops-x-legal-action-intl-hnk", "text": "Australia\u2019s eSafety commissioner has dropped her legal bid to force Elon Musk\u2019s social media site X to hide a violent video of a church stabbing in Sydney from global users. Julie Inman Grant had sought a Federal Court ruling after X failed to fully comply with a takedown order issued under the country\u2019s Online Safety Act following the incident in April. Instead, Inman Grant said Wednesday she would \u201cconsolidate action\u201d concerning the removal notice in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT),\u00a0an independent review process that examines decisions taken by the commissioner. \u201cAfter weighing multiple considerations, including litigation across multiple cases, I have considered this option likely to achieve the most positive outcome for the online safety of all Australians, especially children,\u201d she said in a statement. The eSafety commissioner had wanted X to hide the video for users beyond Australian borders. Musk criticized the request as an excessive overreach by an unelected official that could set a precedent for other countries to demand the removal of sensitive material. \u201cOur concern is that if ANY country is allowed to censor content for ALL countries, which is what the Australian \u2018eSafety Commissar\u2019 is demanding, then what is to stop any country from controlling the entire Internet?\u201d\u00a0Musk posted on X in April. In a statement, X welcomed the latest development as a victory for free speech. \u201cThis case has raised important questions on how legal powers can be used to threaten global censorship of speech, and we are heartened to see that freedom of speech has prevailed,\u201d it said. Joanne Gray, a lecturer in digital cultures at the University of Sydney, said the decision to drop the case was \u201crational\u201d for a public institution with limited resources.\u00a0But she added that the question of Australia\u2019s jurisdiction over online content remains unanswered. \u201c[Musk] might claim it\u2019s a victory for free speech but I don\u2019t think that is really what it is. It\u2019s more of a corporate win, and says more about the ability of platform companies to operate outside of the reach of governments,\u201d Gray said. She said the end of the legal action demonstrates the need for a global approach to online regulation, adding that \u201cit\u2019s hard for Australia to fix these issues when it\u2019s acting alone.\u201d The controversial video showed the moment Bishop Mar Mari Emmanuel was stabbed, allegedly by a 16-year-old assailant, while delivering a sermon at the Christ the Good Shepherd Church in western Sydney. The incident set off a riot outside the church that authorities said was stoked by the rapid distribution of the video online. However, in court filings, lawyers for X argued that it had taken down some URLs seen by an Australian audience, but the video was readily available to view on other sites. \u201cThe Video is, and at all material times has been, widely accessible to persons in Australia other than on the X platform, including in its full form on other social media services and various websites,\u201d court documents said. Musk\u2019s lawyers also said the commissioner had failed to consider that the video was shared with the bishop\u2019s consent, not by his assailant. The\u00a0Assyrian\u00a0Orthodox cleric was quoted in court filings as supporting the distribution of the video as an exercise in free speech. \u201cNoting our God given right to freedom of speech and freedom of religion, I am not opposed to [the video] remaining on social media,\u201d the bishop said, according to court documents. In her statement Wednesday, Inman Grant defended her decision to pursue the matter, which she said had given the agency\u00a0an opportunity to test its \u201cnovel regulatory powers \u2026 to protect Australians from online harm.\u201d \u201cOur sole goal and focus in issuing our removal notice was to prevent this extremely violent footage from going viral, potentially inciting further violence and inflicting more harm on the Australian community. I stand by my investigators and the decisions eSafety made,\u201d the statement said. Inman Grant told Australia\u2019s national broadcaster, the ABC, that she\u2019d been subject to personal attacks, including death threats, from Musk\u2019s supporters. \u201cTargeting a regulator who is here to protect the citizens of Australia is really beyond the pale, but it\u2019s not surprising,\u201d she reportedly told the ABC. X, formerly known as Twitter, has faced ongoing scrutiny over the spread of controversial content on the platform, including hateful speech and conspiracy theories, since it was taken over by Musk in 2022. Last month, the platform named a new head of safety, nine months after its previous safety leader resigned following just seven months in the role.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/media/australia-esafety-drops-x-legal-action-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_04_economy_general-election-issue-uk-economy", "text": "When UK voters elect a new government on July 4, the health of the world\u2019s sixth-biggest economy will likely be the main factor in deciding the outcome. The Conservative Party of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has been in office since 2010, a period that has included the twin shocks of a pandemic and war in Ukraine. But the United Kingdom has also been held back by two self-inflicted wounds \u2014 deep austerity in the wake of the global financial crisis and the 2016 decision to quit the European Union, which raised new barriers to trade. Economic growth has been anemic in recent years, squeezing living standards and starving public services of funds. In their first televised debate Tuesday, Sunak and Keir Starmer, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, clashed over Britain\u2019s economic fortunes, taxes, immigration and the state of the National Health Service \u2014 key issues for voters, according to polling by YouGov. The stakes are high: opinion polls suggest the Conservatives are set to be booted from office, with Labour on course to win a UK election for the first time since Tony Blair took the party to victory in 2005.  Sunak pointed to rising wages and a strengthening economy as proof that his plan to \u201crestore economic stability\u201d is working. Starmer, meanwhile, attacked the Conservative Party for presiding over 14 years of economic decline. Several audience members highlighted that many households are still experiencing a cost-of-living crisis and are struggling to pay their bills. When they cast their ballots, voters will consider whether their lives have materially improved since 2010, when the Conservatives came to power. Here\u2019s what data shows has happened to wages, living standards, the value of the pound, house prices and waiting times for medical treatment on the NHS. Incomes have barely risen Inflation, which hit a record 11.1% just 18 months ago, has eaten into households\u2019 spending power. Although the annual pace of price rises has slowed \u2014 and wages have now grown faster than inflation for nine months in a row \u2014 real, or inflation-adjusted, pay has barely increased since 2010, which means people aren\u2019t substantially better-off. \u201cPoor income growth has been an unfortunate feature of economic life in the UK over the last 15 years. And it has been slow growth for essentially everyone: rich and poor, old and young,\u201d Tom Waters, an associate director at the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), an economics research institute, said in a statement Friday. \u201cIn the long run, what is needed is rises in productivity,\u201d he added. The Resolution Foundation makes the same diagnosis. The think tank has estimated that real average weekly earnings last year were \u00a3205 ($262) below the level they would have been had they carried on growing at the same pace as before the 2008 financial crisis. \u201cWeak productivity growth has delivered an unprecedented stagnation in real wages, even before the highest inflation in four decades hit,\u201d it said in a report published in December. Living standards have disappointed Feeble growth in productivity \u2014 often measured as gross domestic product per hour worked \u2014 has hamstrung many advanced economies since at least the global financial crisis. But the United Kingdom has fared worse than many peers, resulting in a bigger hit to incomes and also hurting living standards. \u201cThe period between 2010 and 2024 has been economically remarkable,\u201d Nick Ridpath, research economist at the IFS, said in a statement Monday, citing slow earnings growth and steep public spending cuts, among other things. \u201cAt the heart of it all was a period of abysmal growth in productivity and, with it, living standards.\u201d According to the IFS, in the 12 years before 2007, the average income of Britain\u2019s working age population rose more than 40% \u2014 more than three times the growth in the United States and seven times that in Germany. By contrast, between 2007 and 2019, the typical UK income increased just 6% \u2014 half the level of the United States and almost three times less than in Germany. The pound is 14% weaker The UK currency has also taken a beating over the past 14 years \u2014 not helped by the Brexit referendum in June 2016 or the disastrous \u201cmini\u201d budget unveiled by former Conservative Prime Minister Liz Truss in September 2022. Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union has haunted the pound and inward investment into the country for almost a decade. A weaker currency exacerbates inflation \u2014 which peaked at a higher level in Britain than it did in the United States and the eurozone \u2014 because it raises the cost of imported goods. \u201cBrexit led to a large and long-lasting increase in uncertainty, which analysis shows reduced investment, which will have reduced output and productivity,\u201d Clare Lombardelli, the incoming deputy governor for monetary policy at the Bank of England, said in a recent questionnaire published on the central bank\u2019s website. \u201cThe data also shows that Brexit has had a negative effect on trade, which will also weigh on productivity,\u201d she added. Home ownership is in decline While real wages have hardly grown, house prices have soared, pushing the dream of home ownership out of reach for many Brits. From a peak of \u00a3291,716 ($373,236) in September 2022 the average house price fell to \u00a3284,691 ($364,242) last December, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). But prices remain high by historic standards, particularly when compared with incomes. With affordability stretched, home ownership rates have fallen. In 2021, 62% of households in England owned their home, census data showed. That\u2019s down from 68% in 2008/2009, according to official figures, shortly before the Conservatives came to power.  Millions of Brits are stuck in rental properties, which have also become more expensive. On average, households now spend more than 29% of their after-tax income on rent, up from 24% in 2010, according to Zoopla, a property company. The NHS is overstretched One of Sunak\u2019s five promises to voters early on in his premiership was to cut NHS waiting lists. But the number of patients waiting for non-emergency treatment in England has climbed from 6.1 million in January 2023, when he made that pledge, to around 6.3 million in March this year. The treatment spans diagnostic tests and scans, procedures such as hip and knee replacements, as well as non-urgent cardiac surgery, cancer treatment and neurosurgery. Since some patients require multiple treatments, the number of outstanding appointments stood at 7.5 million in March, according to NHS England. NHS waiting lists have grown steadily since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, contributing to worker shortages in the UK. According to the ONS, ill health was the reason why more than 2.8 million people were \u201ceconomically inactive\u201d between January and March 2024. An ONS survey in February 2023 found that a third of the economically inactive were waiting for NHS treatment.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/economy/general-election-issue-uk-economy/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_judges-stern-rebuke-of-elon-musks-x-gives-researchers-fresh-hope", "text": "A federal judge\u2019s decision this week reprimanding Elon Musk\u2019s X will have reverberating effects on efforts to hold influential online platforms accountable, legal experts and advocacy groups say. On Monday, District Judge Charles Breyer dismissed and excoriated a lawsuit by X against online watchdog group Center for Countering Digital Hate as an attempt to silence the non-profit group for sounding alarms about hate speech on the platform. Breyer wrote in Monday\u2019s order that the lawsuit was \u201cunabashedly\u201d about \u201cpunishing\u201d reports written by CCDH, which X had accused of campaigning to drive away its advertisers. Breyer held that the reports were \u201cunquestionably\u201d protected by the group\u2019s free speech rights. Now, that decision could embolden other research groups and Musk critics who have faced legal threats from the billionaire. The CCDH case \u2014 in the US District Court for the Northern District of California \u2014\u00a0has been widely viewed as a bellwether for research and accountability on X, where Musk has restored the accounts of previously banned White supremacists and spreaders of misinformation and where Musk himself has amplified various conspiracy theories. And CCDH is not the only organization that has faced attacks by self-proclaimed \u201cfree speech absolutist\u201d Musk after criticizing or raising concerns about his platform. \u201cThis is an important decision that sees Elon Musk\u2019s lawsuit for what it is \u2014 an effort to punish his critics for constitutionally protected speech and to deter researchers from studying his platform,\u201d said Alex Abdo, litigation director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, which had filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the case arguing that private companies should not be allowed to use breach of contract claims to punish criticism. \u201cSociety needs reliable and ethical research into social media platforms, and often that research relies on being able to study publicly available posts,\u201d Abdo said. X said it plans to appeal Breyer\u2019s decision. Musk\u2019s threats against X critics In his first year as owner of X, formerly known as Twitter, Musk threatened legal action against the Anti-Defamation League for defamation, as well as against Microsoft and Meta for allegedly improper data and trade secret access, respectively. None of those threats ever amounted to real lawsuits. He did, however, sue the progressive media watchdog Media Matters over its\u00a0analysis\u00a0highlighting antisemitic and pro-Nazi content on X, alleging that the group\u2019s testing methodology was not representative of how real users experience the site and that the report was designed to drive away advertisers. Legal experts have described that case as \u201cweak\u201d on the merits and as a \u201cbogus\u201d attempt to chill criticism of X. This week\u2019s court decision may be only a temporary setback in Musk\u2019s wider plan to stifle criticism, said Media Matters CEO Angelo Carusone. Musk\u2019s new playbook, Carusone said, enlists the help of sympathetic Republican attorneys general to investigate independent reporting organizations and tie them up in legal proceedings. The states of Texas and Missouri each announced probes into Media Matters following X\u2019s lawsuit against the group, to which Musk responded, \u201cGreat!\u201d As recently as Monday, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey filed a petition in state court seeking to compel Media Matters\u2019 cooperation with his investigation. The filing came a week after he appeared with Musk in a live event on X \u2014 which Carusone said shows how Musk hopes to deputize the power of government to silence his critics. \u201cThey have every reason to do it,\u201d Carusone said of the AGs\u2019 investigations. \u201cThey get the political benefits, they get the attention. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any cost to them yet. And if they are successful at developing this new playbook, this new terrain, legally, then it\u2019s going to pave the way for them to just use this tool and tactic over and over and over again.\u201d A representative for X did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Carusone\u2019s claims. Researchers face hurdles to studying on-platform behavior Researchers from non-profits and academic institutions have had a harder time studying X since Musk\u2019s takeover in 2022. Academics need large samples of posts, shares, likes and other data to study social media trends in mis- and disinformation, public health, elections and other key topics. But one of Musk\u2019s first changes at X was to put access to platform data behind a steep paywall. Researchers and civil society groups said the new subscription fees \u2014 costing up to $2.5 million a year \u2014\u00a0were \u201coutrageously expensive\u201d and made it impossible to do their work, reducing transparency of a critical platform. The change may have forced some researchers to rely more heavily on first-person observational data to draw conclusions about user behavior on X. Groups like CCDH have also used automated \u201cscraping\u201d of publicly viewable content from X rather than paying the company for data directly, a tactic that helped give rise to X\u2019s initial lawsuit. Efforts by X and other social media companies to limit research transparency makes them less accountable to the public at best and, at worst, could mask malicious behavior, said David Karpf, an associate professor in the School of Media and Public Affairs at George Washington University. \u201cWe need independent research to have any real measure of what\u2019s going on at X/Twitter. Musk is only ever going to release data that makes his company look good,\u201d Karpf said. \u201cThese platforms are too big and too vital to the spread of information to be left unmonitored.\u201d \u201cThis is an election year,\u201d Karpf added, \u201cand the platforms are taking steps to make it harder to monitor how their services are used for malignant ends.\u201d Free Press, another media accountability organization that has been critical of Musk\u2019s leadership of X and which called for advertisers to pause their spending on the platform shortly after his takeover, also celebrated Breyer\u2019s ruling as potentially removing at least one hurdle that watchdog organizations face. \u201cThe guardrails for democracy are hanging by a thread and we have dwindling insights into platform practices as researchers face lawsuits, congressional subpoenas and other scare tactics,\u201d said Nora Benavidez, senior counsel and director of digital rights at Free Press. Ultimately, Benavidez called the ruling \u201ca reminder that platform accountability is essential and will inevitably prevail when up against bullies like Musk who try to silence us.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/judges-stern-rebuke-of-elon-musks-x-gives-researchers-fresh-hope/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_19_success_wall-street-bonuses", "text": "Last year wasn\u2019t the most lucrative for Wall Street bankers, but their bonus payouts still easily trounced US median household income. The average Wall Street bonus for 2023 was $176,500, according to estimates that will be released Tuesday morning by New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli. That\u2019s down 2% from the $180,000 recorded in 2022. Both those averages were well below the $240,000 paid out in 2021. That the average bonus was slightly down isn\u2019t surprising. Wall Street earnings last year were mixed, and merger and acquisition activity was underwhelming. \u201cWall Street\u2019s profits were up 1.8% in 2023, but firms have taken a more cautious approach to compensation and more employees have joined the securities industry, which accounts for the slight decline in the average bonus,\u201d DiNapoli said in a statement. Nevertheless, a little perspective: The average Wall Street bonus, which comes on top of the nearly half-a-million-dollar average Wall Street salary, was itself almost 2.5 times higher than the median US household income of $74,580, according to Census data for 2022. Wall Street bonuses and general employment in the securities industry provide vital revenue streams for the New York State and New York City economies, accounting most recently for 27% of the state\u2019s tax collections and 7% of city tax revenue, according to DiNapoli\u2019s office. The securities industry \ufeffin the city employed roughly 198,500 people last year, up from 191,600 the year before. And DiNapoli estimates that 1 in 11 of the city\u2019s jobs are either directly or indirectly associated with the industry. The total estimated bonus pool for 2023 was\u00a0slightly lower than the year before and is\u00a0projected to bring in $4 million less in state income tax revenue and $2 million less for the city revenue than bonuses in 2022 did. Still, DiNapoli noted, \u201cWhile these bonuses affect income tax revenues for the state and city, both budgeted for larger declines so the impact on projected revenues should be limited.\u201d It should be noted that the comptroller\u2019s numbers only reflect the bonuses paid to securities industry employees working for firms based in New York City. Beyond bringing in tax revenue for government coffers, Wall Street workers contribute substantially to the local Gotham economy. DiNapoli said that more employees in financial services (65%) are working in-office on any given day compared to 58% working in other industries in the city, at least as of September 2023. And that securities industry employees use the subway more than other workers in the city. All in, he estimates that Wall Street is responsible for roughly 14% of economic activity in the city. As critical as that is, the city and state are about much more than just Wall Street. \u201cThe securities industry\u2019s continued strength should not overshadow the broader economic picture in New York, where we need all sectors to enjoy full recovery from the pandemic,\u201d DiNapoli said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/19/success/wall-street-bonuses/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_04_business_bob-kelley-used-car-kelley-blue-book-dies-96", "text": "If you\u2019re wondering how much your car is worth, or how much to pay for that car you\u2019re thinking of buying, there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll check KBB.com. That\u2019s short for Kelley Blue Book, and it\u2019s one of the longest-standing sources for used car values there is. A man who was instrumental in its rise to prominence, Bob Kelley, died on May 28 in Indian Wells, California, at the age of 96. The Blue Book\u2019s origins lie in the Kelley Kar Company of Los Angeles, a used car dealership founded by Bob\u2019s uncle, Les Kelley, in 1918 with a few Model T Fords. Wanting to grow his inventory, Kelley Kar Company circulated a list of cars it wanted to buy and how much it would pay for them. By 1926, that list turned into the first Kelley Blue Book pricing guide for used cars. Long ago, Bob Kelley was a \u201clot boy\u201d at the dealership run by his uncle and his father, Sidney \u201cBuster\u201d Kelley. He did things like filling tires. Eventually, he took charge of fixing up used cars and estimating their resale value, the kind of figures that would go into the paper guide. By the 1960s, that book became the whole business. The family sold the car dealership and sold the pricing guide, separately, to a private investor, said Bob Kelley\u2019s son-in-law Charlie Vogelheim. Buster and Bob Kelley both signed 40-year management contracts to continue running operations, though, he said. For most of the first 30 years as a standalone business, the Blue Book was largely an industry source, not something for the general public to use, according to KBB.com. Car dealers, finance companies and insurance companies relied on its values and the book helped shape how people thought about what cars are worth. Kelley Blue Book claims to be the first to show the effect of mileage on a used vehicle\u2019s value, for example. Other related products were added over the years, including a new car pricing guide in 1966, RV and motorcycle guides and even a \u201cManufactured Housing\u201d price guide. In 1995, Kelley Blue Book started a website, making its data easily accessible to the general public, not just industry insiders. Still, the book continued in publication every two months for several more years, said Vogelheim, because not everyone was using the internet. \u201cThe nice thing about the new technology is you could get fresh values distributed more frequently and more specific in terms of your information,\u201d he said, \u201cbut, you know, the book, if you dropped it, it\u2019d still work. You didn\u2019t have to plug it in and recharge or anything like that.\u201d Bob retired from the company in 2000. Vogelheim worked with him at Kelley Blue Book starting in 1985 and was there when Kelley retired. \u201cBob was my mentor, going through all of the vehicle values, relationships between the different vehicles and, of course, the whole operation of publishing the book,\u201d Vogelheim said. \u201cBefore the computer, we did it internally, the whole set up and delivery of the proof sheets and then the actual printing and distribution.\u201d The last step in the production process was rounding off the corners of the small book so dealers could easily slip it into a shirt pocket, he said. Bob Kelley also taught people to pay attention to what customers actually valued and would pay for in their cars, which was more complicated than just subtracting a certain amount from the price of the new car. For instance, some early 1990s Lexus cars came with a phone installed as an expensive option, said Vogelheim, but, when the cars were sold as used, the clunky corded phone actually reduced the car\u2019s value. \u201cIt was in the way,\u201d he said. Kelley Blue Book and its website, KBB.com, were purchased by the auto sales website Autotrader in 2010, becoming part of the privately owned conglomerate Cox Enterprises. There were, and are, competitors to Kelley Blue Book, of course. A company called Edmunds started its own consumer-focused pricing guide in 1966, and it also went online in 1995 as another source of automotive pricing information. But Kelley Blue Book was one of the very earliest to create a standard way for shoppers and the industry to gauge the value of a used car.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/business/bob-kelley-used-car-kelley-blue-book-dies-96/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_07_cars_china-war-of-words-byd-huawei-ev-intl-hnk", "text": "As profit margins get squeezed, temperatures are rising in the world\u2019s biggest car market. A tense exchange between two major Chinese electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers in recent days highlights the pressures they face as a price war in the industry intensifies. It all started on Saturday, when Yu Chengdong, the chairman of Huawei\u2019s smart car unit, implied that rival EV maker BYD is racing ahead because of low prices rather than the quality of its cars. \u201cCurrently, BYD is \u2026 number one in the rat race, because it has extremely low costs,\u201d he said at a public forum in Shenzhen. BYD, a carmaker Elon Musk once laughed at, overtook his Tesla (TSLA) at the end of last year as the biggest seller of electric vehicles on the planet. (Tesla regained its position\u00a0in the first quarter of this year, but they\u2019re neck and neck.) \u201cWe are not good at competing with ultra-low prices. Rather, we are good at competing with value, intelligence, luxury, comfort, safety, high quality, excellent and comfortable user experience,\u201d Yu added. While top executives from the EV industry often post on social media about a range of topics, including technology and advertising, they rarely name rival companies, especially when criticizing them. In recent months, a price war has escalated in China\u2019s hyper-competitive EV industry, with manufacturers battling for consumer attention with deep discounts or newer, cheaper models. The industry suffered a blow in May when US President Joe Biden\u00a0quadrupled tariffs\u00a0on electric vehicles from China to 100%, effectively sealing off one of the world\u2019s biggest passenger car markets. It also faces potential extra import duties from the European Union as soon as next week. Yu\u2019s comments about BYD have gone viral on Chinese social media and provoked a sharp retort from the EV giant. \u201cPersonally I have great respect for Huawei. But I feel that if Mr Yu can make fewer comparisons, either at press conferences or public forums, more people will like him, and Huawei\u2019s brand would also gain points,\u201d Li Yunfei, general manager of branding and public relations at BYD, said in a video post on Weibo on Thursday. Li pointed out that Huawei is also trying to \u201ccompete with low prices,\u201d as the company has made significant price cuts in the past year. \u201cWe welcome other brands to show their cars at our booth and compete with ours on the same stage,\u201d he added. On the same day, Wang Chuanfu, founder and chairman of BYD, said at the company\u2019s annual shareholder meeting that its core strength lies in \u201ctechnology and innovation.\u201d BYD will invest 100 billion yuan ($13.8 billion) in developing smart EVs in the future, focusing on generative artificial intelligence and large model technologies, Wang added. Earlier this week, BYD was among a group of nine automakers to receive a green light from the Chinese government for public trials of advanced auto driving. Competition in the world\u2019s largest EV market has become cutthroat. The country has more than 200 EV manufacturers who are grappling with huge oversupply and slowing consumer demand. A brutal price war kicked in last year, with even market leaders like BYD and Tesla rushing to cut prices to retain or expand their market positions. While deep price cuts by manufacturers and government subsidies for car buyers have boosted the volume of sales, overall profitability has fallen. Wang said earlier this year that a \u201cbrutal elimination round\u201d is coming for the industry, urging companies to form economies of scale and brand advantages \u201cas soon as possible.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/cars/china-war-of-words-byd-huawei-ev-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2022_04_25_business_electric-hybrid-corvette", "text": "General Motors will produce a fully electric Chevrolet Corvette, GM President Mark Reuss announced in a LinkedIn post Monday morning.  Reuss didn\u2019t say when the electric Corvette would come, but he hinted that a hybrid model could come relatively soon. \u201cWe will offer an electrified Corvette as early as next year,\u201d he wrote. An accompanying video the company posted to Twitter showed what appeared to be a hybrid Corvette, and in another first, showed the front wheels spinning and throwing snow as if being powered. All Corvettes produced by the company previously have been rear-wheel-drive only. While Reuss\u2019s post implies a hybrid Corvette will be based on the current generation of the car, it\u2019s not clear if the all-electric version will be a variation of this car or a completely different future model. \u201cElectrified\u201d is an auto industry term encompassing everything from hybrid to fully electric vehicles, and anything with an electric motor can count as \u201celectrified.\u201d It has long been rumored that the current generation of the Corvette, the first with its gasoline engine mounted behind the seats instead of in the front, could be built with a hybrid system. Reuss has also previously hinted there would be electrified variants of the car. Various companies are working on electric sports cars. Most all-electric vehicles in production so far have been four-door sedans and SUVs, as the need for batteries lends itself to larger and heavier vehicles. Tesla\u2019s first car, the Lotus Elise-based Tesla Roadster, was an electric sports car, but the second-generation of Tesla Roadster, originally unveiled as a prototype in 2017, has yet to go into production. Some manufacturers, such as Lamborghini, have said that current battery technology doesn\u2019t allow for a optimum sports car performance from a purely electric vehicle. Lamborghini has been working on plug-in hybrid sports cars, though. To date, the Corvette is only available in the base Stingray version with 6.2-liter V8 engine producing up to 495 horsepower. A 670 horsepower Corvette Z06 with a 5.5-liter V8 was unveiled last fall. The previous generation of the Corvette included included a 755-horsepower ZR1 version. Nothing like that has yet been announced for the current model but GM engineers have said a major reason for putting the engine in the back was to allow for better performance at extremely high horsepower levels. Besides saving gas, hybrid systems can also be used in high-performance cars to add additional power and to provide for quicker acceleration since electric motors can provide power to the wheels more quickly than gas engines. Ferrari\u2019s most powerful sports cars are hybrids, for instance.   GM has said it plans to produce only zero-emission vehicles, meaning fully electric or powered by hydrogen fuel cells, by 2035.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/25/business/electric-hybrid-corvette/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_15_success_best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund", "text": "The average federal tax refund is more than $3,000, according to the latest data from the IRS. Since the majority of tax filers get a refund, there\u2019s a fair chance you could get hundreds if not thousands of dollars back in overpaid taxes, especially if you\u2019re also owed a refund from your state government. That money may feel like a windfall, and it\u2019s easy to squander it on a lot of little things. But if you\u2019re looking to improve your current financial situation, here are seven ideas to consider. Well, technically six, but you\u2019ll enjoy the seventh the most. 1. Pay off high-rate debt If you are carrying a balance on your credit card and are paying 20% to 30% in interest, make this your first priority to pay down. At such sky-high rates, \u201cthe debt can grow faster than you can pay it off,\u201d said Eric Bronnenkant, a certified financial planner and head of tax at Betterment, a robo-advisory financial services firm that also has a human advice team on hand to help clients. Keyana Russ, a certified financial planner at Four Ponds Financial Planning, concurred that people\u2019s awareness of how much money they\u2019re paying in interest over time doesn\u2019t always register. \u201cWhat I usually see is people paying the minimum, or they\u2019re charging everyday expenses and not paying off the bill at the end of the month. \u2026 They don\u2019t understand how much interest they\u2019re paying,\u201d Russ said. For example, if you\u2019re carrying a $3,000 balance at 27% interest and you only pay a required minimum of $97.50 every month, it will take you 240 months (which is 20 years) just to pay off the $3,000 \u2014 and, in addition, you will have paid $3,044.57 in interest, for a total of $6,044.57, according to Bankrate.com\u2019s calculator. 2. Create or add to an emergency fund You can use your refund to start or bolster an emergency fund. When it comes to costly emergencies, there are many Americans who don\u2019t have at least three months\u2019 worth of living expenses set aside, let alone enough to easily handle an unexpected bill of $1,000. Be sure to stash the money in a high-yield savings account at an FDIC-insured bank, Russ suggested, noting that the best interest rates are typically offered by online banks. If you have high-rate debt and you\u2019re lacking emergency savings, Russ suggested you might use a portion of your refund to attack your debt and the other portion to create an emergency fund. Bronnenkant favors paying off the high-rate debt first, but, if you\u2019re low on emergency savings and need a critical repair to help keep your job \u2014 such as on your car \u2014 he said it might make sense to set aside money for that repair and put the rest toward your credit card or other high-rate debt. 3. Make an extra payment on your mortgage If you\u2019re carrying a mortgage at a high rate (e.g., 7% to 8%), and you\u2019re not saddled with credit card debt, you might consider making an extra payment or two. \u201cIt can make a difference in the long run towards your principal,\u201d Russ said.\u00a0 You can even view it as an additional form of savings, in the sense that you\u2019re saving yourself an extra 7% \ufeffor so in interest on the portion of the principal you\u2019re paying down, Bronnenkant noted. 4. Invest in a Roth IRA If your income qualifies you to contribute to a Roth IRA, you can contribute up to $7,000 this year ($8,000 if you\u2019re at least 50) with after-tax savings. That money will grow untaxed until retirement, at which point your withdrawals will be tax-free and penalty-free after age 59-1/2, assuming the account has been open for at least five years. (And note: You can still make a 2023 Roth contribution until April 15 this year. The contribution limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if you\u2019re age 50 or older. Bolstering your tax-free retirement savings is great.\u00a0But if you need to access some of your money well before you retire, you may take out any part of your contributions tax-free and penalty-free at any time, \ufeffBronnenkant said. You would only be taxed and penalized if you withdrew the earnings on your contributions before age 59-1/2. (For more information on Roth IRA withdrawal rules, here is an easy-to-understand rundown from Charles Schwab.) 5. Contribute enough to your 401(k) in 2024 to get your full employer match Speaking of retirement savings, if you\u2019re not yet contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match from your employer, a refund can make that easier. Say you get $3,000 back. You can put that money in a high-yield savings account to earn interest. Then, on your workplace 401(k) site, change your paycheck contribution levels so that by the end of the year you will have contributed $3,000 more in pre-tax money than you otherwise would have. For instance, say you\u2019re paid every two weeks and you have 20 more paychecks left until the end of the year. You can boost you biweekly contributions by $150 per paycheck ($150 x 20 = $3,000). \u201cYou want to get the max match from your employer,\u201d Bronnenkant said. 6. Invest for shorter-term goals If in the next three to 10 years you expect to buy a home, take a once-in-a-lifetime trip, renovate a room, send your kids to summer camp or have any other expensive goal, you might consider investing your refund in a diversified mix of low-cost, broad market index funds. The shorter term your goal is, the less risk you want to take. If you need the money within three years, you might consider putting your refund in certificates of deposits and US Treasury bonds. But if your goal is five to 10 years out, and you\u2019re comfortable taking on some more risk and are willing to accept fluctuations in the market, Bronnenkant said, you might put no more than 30% of your refund in a stock index fund and 70% in a total market bond fund if your risk tolerance is conservative; or 50% in each if you have a moderate risk tolerance. If you plan on sending your child to college and you have a 529 plan, you can use your refund to boost your contributions to that plan, Russ said. You may also get a tax break for your contribution depending on the state where you live. 7. Have some fun Unless you\u2019re in truly dire financial straits, if you get a large refund, you might set aside a small portion to do whatever you truly enjoy. \u201cSometimes you just want to have fun and not have it be all business,\u201d Russ said. \u201cYou can set aside some of the money to have fun.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/15/success/best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_27_media_nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over", "text": "Only 80 hours elapsed between NBC News announcing Ronna McDaniel as a paid contributor and the network ousting her from that very role. But for the leadership at NBC Universal News Group, those were 80\u00a0painful hours. On Tuesday evening, following another full day in which the media rumor mill churned at warp speed, NBCU News Group boss Cesar Conde sent staff a memo, notifying his troops that he had reversed his decision to welcome the former Republican National Committee chair to \u201cthe team.\u201d \u201cAfter listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor,\u201d Conde said, adding that he wanted to \u201cpersonally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down.\u201d Conde had no real choice. The embattled NBCU boss, who I\u2019m told dealt with the crisis from an unknown location outside of 30 Rock, was facing an unprecedented rebellion from his most high-profile stars, who one by one went on the air and excoriated leadership\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel. The only aspect of Conde\u2019s note that was surprising was the fact that it came 48 hours late, allowing what started off as a crisis to fester and balloon into one of the worst corporate public relations calamities in recent memory. \u201cWhat a sh*t show!\u201d a media executive exclaimed to me Tuesday shortly after Conde relieved McDaniel of her NBC News credentials. In his note, Conde said he took \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for McDaniel\u2019s hire. But, he also did point the finger, telling staffers that hiring her was \u201ca collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team.\u201d Indeed, multiple people familiar with the matter have told me that the infighting among NBC executives over who was at fault for the disaster has reached a fever pitch, with various factions of the NBCU News Group assigning blame to others. Regardless of who is to blame, the entire affair made clear who is actually in control of the company \u2014 and it\u2019s not Conde & Co. Despite the NBCU C-suite digging their heels in the sand as they resisted dumping McDaniel for days, they were ultimately forced to succumb to pressure from their talent. As a second media executive commented to me, it is now \u201cvery clear who is in charge\u201d after the \u201cweak leadership was put on full display.\u201d \u201cHas Cesar lost the room?\u201d wondered a third media executive. While the Peacock family argues over who was really at fault, the company is facing a fresh public relations mess. Led by Donald Trump, right-wing personalities are already assailing the network as being overrun with intolerant woke leftists. \u201cThese Radical Left Lunatics are CRAZY and the top people at NBC ARE WEAK,\u201d Trump raged on his Truth Social platform. Ari Fleischer, who served as press secretary under President George W. Bush, wrote on X: \u201cWhat NBC is saying is if you\u2019re for Trump, you don\u2019t belong. Good. Let NBC be for Democrats only.\u201d Of course, that narrative is intellectually dishonest. The objection to McDaniel from both within and outside of NBCU was not that she is a Republican. It wasn\u2019t even that she was a Trump-supporting Republican. No, the objection stemmed from the fact that McDaniel was an active participant in the plot to subvert the 2020 vote. And, in addition to that disgraceful history, she had a lengthy track record smearing NBC News and MSNBC. Nevertheless, NBCU will now have to contend with such dishonest attacks being leveled by the right, which will follow them in the days, months, and even years to come. As unfair as it may be, they will certainly damage the network\u2019s brand in Republican circles \u2014 a place it had gone through great pains to appeal to. NBCU will also have to grapple with McDaniel, who spent the last 24 hours or so interviewing lawyers as she gears up for a possible legal fight with the network, according to a person familiar with the matter. The rift between McDaniel and NBCU had grown to such an extent by Tuesday that she was not informed by network brass that she had been dismissed, I\u2019m told. Instead, McDaniel learned of her ouster in press reports. While NBCU is being beaten up on the right, the company\u2019s leadership was quickly praised by its journalists and top stars. Shortly after Conde sent out his memo, Rachel Maddow appeared on Joy Reid\u2019s show, where the two lauded Conde for reversing course. \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/27/media/nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "business"}}

However, it\u2019s clear that there is something different about Dex; she\u2019s an entirely virtual \u201cdigital human,\u201d designed by a startup in the UK. For her performances, Dex is displayed on a video screen or as a holographic projection, with her mixes created by humans. She is animated using Unreal Engine \u2014 a 3D modeling software widely used in video games \u2014 combined with motion-capture. Generative artificial intelligence allows her to remember information and respond to questions, using a voice also generated by AI. \u201cShe\u2019s probably one of the only digital humans in the performance space that you can have a conversation and interact with,\u201d says Denise Harris, CCO of startup Sum Vivas. \u201cYou can ask her anything. She is a genius about music.\u201d Last month, Dex performed at Digital Fashion Weeks in New York, Paris and Milan, and she has modeled outfits by Prada and Louis Vuitton at digital fashion events. For Liverpool-based Sum Vivas she\u2019s a \u201cshowpiece\u201d for more practical applications. The company is now developing digital humans that can \u201clisten\u201d to people\u2019s questions and converse in real time. \u201cShellie\u201d can provide product information as an avatar on company websites, while \u201cArif\u201d is set to direct passengers and answer questions as a multilingual concierge on screens at airports. According to CEO and founder Rob Sims, digital humans can help bridge the gap between AI technology and people. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve found is when people start working with and conversing with a digital human, they very quickly suspend disbelief,\u201d Sims tells CNN. \u201cIt becomes natural.\u201d AI explosion Since OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT was launched in November 2022, considerable hype has surrounded the potential of generative AI \u2014 artificial intelligence powered by huge datasets of information, capable of generating text outputs in a conversational way. Record levels of investment into generative AI have followed, with over $21 billion poured into the industry during the first nine months of last year, according to data insights company Pitchbook. In March 2023, Google launched Bard (recently renamed Gemini) and around the same time Anthropic released its AI assistant Claude. As generative AI chatbots become increasingly ubiquitous, Sum Vivas is one of several companies looking to make them more human. US and New Zealand-based UneeQ has developed animated conversational \u201cdigital humans\u201d that can be used as virtual sales reps and customer service agents on company websites, and this month it debuted Sama 2.0, an animated cabin crew member that answers questions on Qatar Airways\u2019 website and app. Microsoft recently announced that users of its Azure software would be able to create lifelike avatars capable of turning text prompts into animated speech. However, there are widespread concerns about the impact AI could have on the job market.  \u201cWhen we rely on automated tools, what skills are we losing in the process?\u201d asks Jennifer Ding, senior researcher at the Alan Turing Institute, the UK\u2019s national institute for data science and artificial intelligence. \u201cIn some ways, we think of AI as something that\u2019s helping us or augmenting our work,\u201d she says. \u201cHowever, alongside, this fear of replacement is bubbling up more and more.\u201d Harris, however, points to new opportunities within digital human design and development. \u201cEvery scenario that we found, we\u2019re creating jobs and working in harmony with people rather than taking away jobs,\u201d she says. \u201cDigital humans, first and foremost, should work with other human colleagues,\u201d adds Sims. \u201cWe\u2019ll move into a stage where digital humans will start to become just another member of the team, with added benefits for that team, and obviously the customers they serve.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/business/digital-humans-ai-dj-dex-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_07_business_adults-preschoolers-toy-buying", "text": "Adults bought more toys for themselves than for any other age group last quarter for the first time ever, surpassing toys for even the historically-dominant preschooler market.  Consumers 18 years of age and up spent $1.5 billion in toy-related purchases in the period from January through April, overtaking the three-to five-year-old demographic as the most important age group for the toy industry, according to a new report from market research firm Circana. Looking back over a longer period, the report said as many as 43% of adults purchased a toy for themselves in the past year, with the top reasons being for personal fun, socialization and for collecting. Trading cards, Squishmallows (which are a rage across age groups), Lego sets and sports toys were among the most sought-after toy products in the period, the report said. As adults play with toys more and more, the trend bodes well to counter the decline in overall toy sales. Circana said toy industry dollar sales declined by 1% through April, versus the same period a year ago but are still up 38% compared to 2019. \u201cTailwinds, like the growing adult toy market and spending power of higher income households and grandparents, drive positive trends,\u201d Juli Lennett, vice president and toy industry advisor at Circana, said in the report. \u201cHowever, headwinds like rising household debt, slowing GDP growth, and fluctuating consumer confidence indicate potential challenges. \u201c Key part of \u2018adulting\u2019 involves toys While adults have always bought toys for themselves, fueled by the collector market for brands like Barbie and Hot Wheels, that niche market, industry experts said, has gone mainstream in the last five years. The pandemic was an important catalyst for it. \u201cDuring the pandemic, when people were flush with cash and had time to spend at home whether with their families or alone, they wanted to reconnect with the toys that made them happy as kids,\u201d said James Zahn, Editor in Chief of industry trade publication The Toy Book, in an interview with CNN. But people who were already toy collectors by that point ramped up their interest. \u201cWe\u2019re talking everything, dolls, action figures and diecast vehicles,\u201d he said. \u201cOutside of collectibles, boardgames, Lego building sets, trading cards, which are extraordinarily hot again, are also firing up adult interest.\u201d Some toymakers, he said, are now introducing new products straight for the adult population. \u201cJanuary Through April, in the actions figure category, the top two new items that came out were both items that kids are not going to buy,\u201d Zahn said. \u201cThe No. 1 item is the X-Men 97 Marvel Legends action figure collection from Hasbro, inspired by an animated series geared towards an adult audience.\u201d The second buzziest new item in the period is a Star Wars The Black Series Clone Caption Rex role play helmet from Hasbro. \u201cIt is a $130 collectible that essentially looks like a movie prop,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, old-fashioned modeling kits that were once popular with older shoppers have been replaced by Lego sets. \u201cThat very therapeutic idea of sitting down to create something of your own as an adult has a new format from a traditional model kit to a building set,\u201d Zahn set. \u201cLego gets a ton of that 18 and older market.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/business/adults-preschoolers-toy-buying/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_21_opinions_sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic", "text": "The biggest tech news this week is the\u00a0ouster\u00a0of Sam Altman from his role as CEO of OpenAI, a move that has shaken the company and the industry. Hundreds of OpenAI employees have threatened to\u00a0resign. Altman has already\u00a0moved on\u00a0to a role at Microsoft. And OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is on its\u00a0third CEO\u00a0in as many days. It\u2019s all very juicy. But this drama should also be raising larger questions, far beyond one company\u2019s internal hirings and firings, including: Who are the people making the decisions\u00a0that will determine so much of our technological future? What guiding principles are they using to make those decisions? And how should other institutions \u2013 governments, non-tech industries, global alliances, regulatory bodies \u2013 reign in the worst excesses of potentially dangerous AI innovators? OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, with an explicit mission to harness what may soon be superhuman intelligence \u201cto benefit humanity as a whole.\u201d But that sensibility hasn\u2019t lasted. The company now has a multi-billion-dollar for-profit arm. They have been developing new technologies at lightning speed, and sometimes sending them out to the public\u00a0before some employees believed they were ready. The company has already reportedly invented an AI technology so dangerous they will never release it \u2013 but they also\u00a0won\u2019t tell\u00a0reporters or the public exactly what it is. This dynamic \u2013 a potentially dangerous technology developed at extreme speed, largely behind closed doors \u2013 is partly to blame for Altman\u2019s firing. The OpenAI board, according to\u00a0CNN\u2019s David Goldman, worried that \u201cthe company was making the technological equivalent of a nuclear bomb, and its caretaker, Sam Altman, was moving so fast that he risked a global catastrophe.\u201d At particular issue seemed to be Altman\u2019s efforts to make the tools behind ChatGPT available to anyone who wanted to make their own version of the chatbot. This could be widely disastrous, some board members worried. But then they fired him without warning, and apparently without involving Microsoft, the company\u2019s largest shareholder. Now, Altman is at the new AI group at Microsoft, and one has to wonder if the oversight and caution there will be on par with that at OpenAI, or if he\u2019ll be handed carte blanche to push as fast and hard as he wants. And for all the justified reticence of the OpenAI board, the company has carried out much of its work in secrecy \u2013 without the public really understanding what a handful of unaccountable technologists are building, and how it is nearly guaranteed to indelibly change their lives. AI is broadly understood to have the potential to reshape vast swaths of human existence. At the very least, it seems nearly guaranteed to change how we process information, how we communicate, how we learn and how we work (and if we work). And the ramifications could be much more extreme. AI technologies have already demonstrated the ability\u00a0to lie and to cover their tracks. They have already been able to\u00a0suggest the design\u00a0to make a virus spread more quickly. Many researchers\u00a0acutely understand\u00a0just how quickly these machines could develop the capacity to annihilate us, including Altman: He has a prepper\u2019s paradise prepared in Big Sur, complete with guns and \u201cgas masks from the Israeli Defense Force\u201d in case AI goes off the rails and the robots go to war against humans,\u00a0according to reporting in the New Yorker. But don\u2019t worry, he told an Atlantic reporter: If AI is determined to wipe us out, \u201cno gas mask is helping anyone.\u201d (If you want an excellent and terrifying rundown of AI\u2019s risks \u2013 at least those we understand right now, which are almost certainly a mere sliver of the looming perils \u2013\u00a0the Atlantic profile of Altman and his technology\u00a0is worth a read). AI is very exciting technology. But it is also a potentially very dangerous one, and not in the social media sense of \u201cit may give us bad self-esteem and make us lonelier\u201d but in the sense of \u201cit could break down human societies and kill us all.\u201d Given the life-altering potential of AI \u2013 that even if it doesn\u2019t kill us all, it will almost certainly change human existence in unprecedented ways at unprecedented speed \u2013 we all have a stake in how it\u2019s being developed. And yet the development is being left to a handful of people (who seem to be\u00a0largely\u00a0men) in Silicon Valley, and other tech pockets around the globe. And we all have a stake in whose interests AI will serve \u2013 and right now, its development is being funded with billions of dollars by people expecting to make a huge profit. Do the interests of the public align with the interests of the shareholders to whom profit-driven, potentially tremendously lucrative-for-a-few companies are beholden? Or with the interests of tech entrepreneurs who are primarily excited about being at the forefront of the AI revolution, regardless of the potential human costs? One thing is clear: AI is coming. And how it is built and unleashed on the public matters more than perhaps any technology of the past century. It is, indeed, up there with the atom bomb in its destructive potential \u2013 except likely more difficult to regulate and control. \u201cRegulation\u201d does not begin to scratch the surface of what\u2019s needed to make sure that the AI future is not a catastrophic one, especially since the development of AI is now a massive international arms race, with particularly horrific implications if bad actors develop this technology first. But regulation is, at minimum, a necessary step. So is transparency: In the US, companies have wide leverage to work behind a veil of secrecy, and much of what AI companies do is kept secret to stymy competition. But the public certainly has a right to understand what life-altering technologies are set to be inflicted upon us, and what the creators are doing to protect humanity \u2013 our jobs, our communities, our families, our connections, our educations and our abilities to build a life of purpose, but also our lives and our safety. The Altman story is fascinating because Altman is the most powerful figure in AI technology, which in effect makes him one of the most powerful men in the world. But that should give us pause: Who is he, what power does he hold, what is he doing with it, who does he answer to, and are we comfortable with this much life-altering potential being held by a few unaccountable people?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/21/opinions/sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "business"}}

The famed meme stock icon, also known as \u201cRoaring Kitty,\u201d made a long-awaited appearance on a livestream on his YouTube channel Friday. Sporting long hair, a thick bandage wrapped around his head, gaudy white sunglasses, a sling and a beer, Gill livestreamed against a background of Yahoo! Finance\u2019s GameStop stock ticker page. \u201cIt\u2019s been a few years now. I hope y\u2019all are good,\u201d said Gill, a native of Brockton, Massachusetts. \u201cThis is me, by the way. I see a lot of question marks \u2014 \u2018Is he back? Is it someone else?\u2019 I mean, can you tell it\u2019s me now?\u201d Gill confirmed that he is behind the posts on his X and Reddit accounts, and that the screenshots he has uploaded on the latter platform are of his own portfolio. \u201cThese are my positions. I\u2019m not working with anyone else. I\u2019m not working with hedge funds,\u201d he said. Gill had communicated exclusively by posting memes, gifs, short video clips and screenshots of his portfolio until the livestream, leaving it unclear if it even was Gill behind the social media posts. GameStop shares slid during his livestream and were halted several times for volatility. The livestream lasted roughly 50 minutes, much shorter than his previous livestreams that typically went on for several hours. \u201cWhat can I say about GameStop? I mean, the funny thing is that I have a lot of the same feelings about everything,\u201d said Gill. \u201cThey\u2019re in the transformation stage here. \u2026 I feel like I see enough. I believe (CEO Ryan Cohen) might be able to do it.\u201d In a surprise move, GameStop brought forward its first quarter earnings to Friday from next Tuesday. The video game retailer recorded a loss of $32.3 million, slightly better than the $50.5 million loss the prior year. First quarter sales slipped to $0.9 billion, from $1.2 billion the year before. Gill cautioned that while he has faith in Cohen, traders should reach their own conclusions. \u201cIt remains to be seen. You should keep your eye on stuff, too, reserve the right to change your mind just like I do. Don\u2019t follow anyone blindly,\u201d Gill said. Shares of GameStop slid more than 39% on Friday, notching its worst day since February 2021. The video game stock has seen wild swings in recent weeks reminiscent of the meme stock craze after Gill\u2019s return to social media in May. Gill also acknowledged reports that E*Trade is considering removing him from its platform and said that he logs on every morning wondering if he\u2019ll be able to access his account. He shared another update on his portfolio, which showed he has not sold any of his 5 million shares or exercised his 120,000 call options after his last update on Thursday. His total GameStop holdings were worth more than $300 million as of mid-day Friday, down roughly $200 million after the stock\u2019s steep losses during the trading session.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/investing/roaring-kitty-keith-gill-gamestop/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "business"}}

A new national stock exchange, based in Dallas, and backed by Wall Street heavyweights like BlackRock and Citadel Securities, is looking to take on the world-famous New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. The newly formed TXSE Group announced its plans to file for registration with the US Securities and Exchange Commission later this year. The group is backed by more than two dozen investors with $120 million in funding \u2013 that makes it the most well-capitalized exchange entrant to even file with the SEC. \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to bring to fruition the long-held vision for a national stock exchange in Texas,\u201d\u00a0TXSE Group founder and CEO James Lee said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cTexas and the other states in the southeast quadrant have become economic powerhouses. Combined with the demand we are seeing from investors and corporations for expanded alternatives to trade and list equities, this is an opportune time to build a major, national stock exchange in Texas.\u201d The group said it was hoping to benefit from the more than 5,200 private equity-sponsored companies in the region that may want to go public. Lee told\u00a0The Wall Street Journal that the group hopes to officially launch its exchange in 2026. The problem with going public America has lost half its public companies since the 1990s. Back in 1996, there were 8,000 companies on US exchanges. Today that count has dropped by more than 50% to just 3,700, according to\u00a0data from\u00a0the Center for Research in Security Prices. It\u2019s not that America has half as many companies as 30 years ago \u2013 it\u2019s that companies are increasingly staying private, largely outside the scrutiny of the public eye and markets. Intensified reporting requirements, higher litigation expenses, costly regulations, overbearing board governance, shareholder activism, heightened public scrutiny and the pressure of quarterly earnings have driven companies away from public markets. There are now about five times as many private equity-backed firms in the US as there are\u00a0publicly held companies, according to economists at Wells Fargo. The trend has been growing for some time. In 1999, the average US technology firm transitioned to the public markets after four years, Wells Fargo research shows. By 2019, that figure increased to 11 years. \u201cCompanies that remain private can avoid the burden and cost of regulatory requirements and focus on long-term strategic plans,\u201d they wrote. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, expressed worry about the changes in his annual shareholder letter in April. \u201cThis trend is serious,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe really need to consider: Is this the outcome we want?\u201d The TXSE Group said in a press release on Wednesday that it hopes to help relieve some of that burden. \u201cTXSE\u2019s planned launch comes as changes in the equity markets provide an opportunity for greater alignment and more competition,\u201d they wrote. \u201cCorporate issuers and exchange-traded product sponsors are demanding more stability and predictability around listing standards and associated costs. TXSE intends to expand access to US capital markets for all investors, while providing greater access and alignment for public companies and those seeking access to public capital.\u201d While the most popular exchanges in the US are located in New York City, there are about 13 stock exchanges around the country including in Philadelphia and Miami. This exchange, said Lee, would mostly function to list businesses located in Texas and the southeast quadrant of the United States.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/investing/texas-stock-exchange/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_media_nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash", "text": "Cesar Conde has a decision to make \u2014 and it\u2019s not an especially difficult one. The NBCUniversal News Group chair is facing a torrent of backlash from his own staff after greenlighting the hire of former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel as a paid network contributor. Over the last 24 hours, the most prominent and recognizable NBC News and MSNBC personalities have voiced strong displeasure with the company\u2019s decision to welcome McDaniel to \u201cthe team.\u201d And they\u2019re not doing it via anonymous comments to the press. They\u2019re doing it on the record on NBCU\u2019s own air. Chuck Todd broke the dam on Sunday\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with a set of candid comments about the hiring, and Rachel Maddow capped the flood of backlash Monday night with a blistering 30-minute monologue eviscerating the network\u2019s leadership for the \u201cinexplicable\u201d move. Suffice to say, NBCU News Group is in unprecedented territory. Never has a network\u2019s C-suite ever been so thoroughly flogged by its most high-profile stars in such no holds barred fashion. Saying that Conde simply has a crisis on his hands would be a contender for understatement of the year. It\u2019s a five-alarm fire at NBCU News Group, and one of Conde\u2019s own making. While NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown were most directly responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring, a decision that MSNBC boss Rashida Jones did not object to it at the time, the buck ultimately stops with Conde, who hold the real power at the Peacock Network. McDaniel\u2019s hiring could not have happened without Conde\u2019s blessing. It does not take a brilliant political mind with prescient foresight to understand that hiring McDaniel would ignite a firestorm of outrage \u2014 from both within 30 Rock and outside it. Conde, someone who ostensibly supports American democracy, should have rejected McDaniel\u2019s hiring on the grounds that NBCU News Group could not put someone on its payroll who tried to subvert the 2020 vote. As so many of NBCU\u2019s staffers have underscored, the objection to McDaniel is not that she is a Republican. It\u2019s not even that she is a Donald Trump-supporting Republican. It\u2019s that she was an active participant in the plot to overthrow the last presidential election. That is not to even mention McDaniel\u2019s years of demonizing the press, smearing the journalists who work at NBC News and MSNBC as she sought to destroy the credibility of the organization that she ran to after being chased out of the RNC. The notion put forward by NBC that it needed to hire McDaniel to bring its viewers \u201can insider\u2019s perspective on national politics and the future of the Republican Party\u201d is absurd. If that\u2019s the case, the network should move to hire free agents like Tucker Carlson or Candace Owens. They too have their hands on the pulse of the Republican Party. In fact, they represent much more of where the GOP stands today than McDaniel. So, using NBC\u2019s logic, why not hire them? (Spoiler: News organizations rightfully have established basic standards for paid contributors. Asking that your employees have a commitment to democracy, to the truth, and to basic decency is not a big ask.) But even if Conde has no allegiance to basic democratic principles, which this hire calls into question, given that he is known to be a political player who cares deeply about his own image in the press, he should have been wise enough to foresee that hiring McDaniel would be an ill-conceived move. How this did not occur to Conde is unfathomable and shows a tremendous lack of judgment. Even more bizarre is Conde\u2019s management, or lack thereof, since the controversy erupted. It was clear early on that his employees at NBC News and MSNBC did not support McDaniel\u2019s hiring. If that was not evident on Friday, it was clear as day on Sunday after \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d The network\u2019s employees were not only flabbergasted and demoralized by the move, but absolutely enraged by it. At that point, the writing should have been on the wall for Conde \u2014 as it was for every other media executive that I have spoken with over the last 24 hours. It is evident that McDaniel has no real future as an NBC analyst and the decision to bring her on as a contributor will have to be reversed. After all, which NBC or MSNBC program is going to invite her on after all of this? The only real question for Conde after the Sunday morning scolding should have been how he chose to back out of the deal in the least painful way possible. To be fully honest, I very much expected a Sunday evening announcement from NBC, one that would have earned praise from the company\u2019s staff and quickly been swept away by the rush of Trump news Monday morning. But no such announcement came. Instead, Conde has allowed the mess to spiral absolutely out of control. MSNBC\u2019s top stars hammered the network\u2019s leadership throughout the day Monday over the hire. NBC News\u2019 Guild blasted Conde, saying in a statement that under him the company had quietly laid off employees over the last month and instead chosen to \u201cprioritize an election denier over its reporters.\u201d The already severe crisis was allowed to blossom into one of the worst corporate public relations catastrophes in recent memory. All the while, Conde has remained silent. I asked his spokesperson, Stephen Labaton, on Monday whether the NBCU News Group boss had any comment on the situation. Does he have any regret? I didn\u2019t get an on-the-record response. Suffice to say, however, that what Conde does moving forward will say a lot about his character and commitment to democratic values. It will also say a lot about the NBCU News Group and what type of organization it is. In her biting monologue on Monday night, however, Maddow did offer Conde a way out of this mess. \u201cMistakes will be made,\u201d Maddow said.\u201dBut our resilience as a democracy is going to be recognizing when decisions are bad ones and reversing those bad decisions. Hearing legitimate criticism, responding to it, and correcting course. Not digging in. Not blaming others. Take a minute. Acknowledge that maybe it wasn\u2019t the right call.\u201d \u201cIt is a sign of strength, not weakness, to acknowledge when you are wrong,\u201d Maddow added. \u201cIt is a sign of strength. And our country needs us to be strong now.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/media/nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "business"}}

Creative Artists Agency, the talent agency that brokered McDaniel\u2019s deal with NBC, also parted ways with her, the person said. The reversal comes after journalists and anchors at both NBC and its cable news sibling MSNBC publicly denounced the decision to hire McDaniel as a paid analyst in a stunning and unprecedented on-air rebuke of network brass that has embarrassed the Peacock Network. McDaniel, who recently stepped down from the RNC under pressure from former President Donald Trump, was involved in attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. As head of the RNC, she was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d In the years since, McDaniel continued to claim that the election had \u201cproblems\u201d and that Biden did not legitimately win the election, fanning the flames of election denialism. NBC\u2019s announcement Friday that it had hired McDaniel was quickly met with alarm by the network\u2019s journalists. The revolt spilled into public view on Sunday when McDaniel appeared on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with moderator Kristen Welker in her first interview since she was hired by the network. Welker disclosed that the interview had been scheduled to take place prior to NBC announcing McDaniel would become a paid contributor for the network, stating that she had no involvement in her hiring. Following the interview, Chuck Todd, NBC News\u2019 chief political analyst, delivered a stinging on-air criticism of NBC executives for their decision to hire McDaniel, telling Welker, \u201cI think our bosses owe you an apology for putting you in this situation.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a reason a lot of journalists at NBC News are uncomfortable with this,\u201d Todd said, explaining that under McDaniel, the RNC engaged in \u201cgaslighting\u201d and \u201ccharacter assassination\u201d when dealing with the news media. The following day, MSNBC hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough joined Todd in protesting the decision on their program \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d \u201cTo be clear, we believe NBC News should seek out conservative Republican voices to provide balance in their election coverage, but it should be conservative Republicans, not a person who used her position of power to be an anti-democracy election denier,\u201d\u00a0Brzezinski said. \u201cWe hope NBC will reconsider its decision. It goes without saying that she will not be a guest on \u2018Morning Joe\u2019 in her capacity as a paid contributor.\u201d Nicolle Wallace, host of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cDeadline: White House,\u201d later joined in the rebuke, saying on her program that the network\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel was nothing short of a potential threat to democracy. \u201cNBC News is, either wittingly or unwittingly, teaching election deniers that what they can do stretches well beyond appearing on our air and interviews to peddle lies about the sanctity and integrity of our elections,\u201d Wallace told viewers. Rachel Maddow \u2014 the network\u2019s biggest star \u2014 later devoted the first half-hour of her prime-time program to the controversy, saying the decision to hire McDaniel was \u201cinexplicable.\u201d Maddow took issue with McDaniel\u2019s long track record of demonizing the news media, labeling the press as \u201cfake news,\u201d and launching ugly attacks on NBC News journalists and MSNBC hosts. \u201cWe do not take it personally when we get attacked, when they say they want to put us on trial and execute us for treason,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so I want to associate myself with all my colleagues at MSNBC and NBC News who have voiced loud and principled objections to our company for putting on the payroll someone who hasn\u2019t just attacked us as journalists, but someone who is part of an ongoing project to get rid of our system of government,\u201d she said of McDaniel. \u201cSomeone who is still trying to convince Americans that this election stuff doesn\u2019t really work. That this last election wasn\u2019t a real result. That American elections are fraudulent.\u201c The on-air revolt ensnared NBC\u2019s top leaders, including NBCUniversal News Group chair Cesar Conde, NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown, who were responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring. MSNBC president Rashida Jones also did not object to the decision, people familiar with the matter said. In the wake of Conde\u2019s announcement to sever ties with McDaniel, MSNBC host Joy Reid and Maddow addressed the reversal on the network\u2019s air, praising the move as \u201cbold\u201d and \u201cstrong.\u201d \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/media/nbc-news-ousts-ronna-mcdaniel/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_20_investing_microsoft-stock-record-high-altman-openai", "text": "Microsoft stock reached a record high on Monday after the company said that Sam Altman, former chief executive of OpenAI, will join the company to head its artificial intelligence innovation leg. Shares of the tech behemoth rose 2.1% to an all-time high close of $377.44 on Monday, beating the previous record of $376.17. That comes after shares of Microsoft fell 1.7% on Friday, when Sam Altman was ousted from his position at OpenAI in a boardroom coup. Microsoft is the artificial intelligence firm\u2019s biggest stakeholder, with a $13 billion investment in the company. Greg Brockman, who co-founded OpenAI and quit after Altman\u2019s firing, is also joining Microsoft. Altman\u2019s hiring ended days of speculation that the former chief executive could return to the firm after his dramatic firing. Emmett Shear, former CEO of Amazon-owned streaming service Twitch, will replace OpenAI chief technology officer Mira Murati as interim chief executive. Microsoft shares are up about 56% for the year. The stock is one of the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d that have powered the lion\u2019s share of the market\u2019s returns this year, boosted by Wall Street\u2019s bet that artificial intelligence is the next big thing in tech.

Other members of the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d saw a boost on Monday.

{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit", "text": "When Apple launched its first Mac computer in 1984, with its iconic Mac smiley-face \u201chello\u201d greeting, it wanted to differentiate itself in the fledgling PC market. The Mac was approachable with its friendly, innovative design \u2013 Apple\u2019s way of setting the Mac apart in the confusing PC landscape. That consumer-friendly mantra still exists today, with Apple carefully curating an easy-breezy yet controlled user experience across its products, including the billions of iPhones used around the world. But the Biden administration believes Apple took that too far. On Thursday, the Department of Justice sued Apple for illegally monopolizing the smartphone market. In a press conference, the government provided a long list of how Apple has allegedly squashed competition with restrictive app store terms, high fees and its \u201cwalled-garden\u201d approach, restricting how third-party companies interact with its brands and services. The company denied the lawsuit\u2019s allegations and said it plans to fight them. Apple added that the lawsuit could empower the government \u201cto take a heavy hand in designing people\u2019s technology.\u201d But if successful, the lawsuit could ripple across Apple\u2019s products and services. Although the suit could take years to play out, here\u2019s a closer look what it may eventually mean for iPhone users: Changes to the App Store If found liable, the company could be forced to change a number of things. One such change is how iPhone users could get greater access to \u201csuper apps\u201d that have been largely restricted before. The term refers to one-stop-shop apps that allow for messaging, ordering food, payment processing and other capabilities all within one platform.  According to Dipanjan Chatterjee, a principal analyst at market research firm Forrester, super apps most threaten Apple\u2019s preeminence in the lives of its customers. \u201cAn offering like WeChat, dubbed China\u2019s everything app, can provide an alternative to the Apple ecosystem for people to communicate, bank, share memories, talk to businesses and more,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cWhat Apple fears most is becoming irrelevant to its customers.\u201d At the same time, super apps like WeChat are created by larger companies and could, therefore, put some smaller companies at a disadvantage. And the concept hasn\u2019t been welcomed much in the US anyway. The US government, however, could argue that lack of interest may be due to Apple\u2019s high share of the smartphone market and its resistance to offer super apps in its store, Chatterjee said. Better interoperability Apple may also be required to offer more support for cross-platform messaging, an issue the company previously said it\u2019s already working on. The company lets iPhone users send high-quality photos and videos to one another, but similar texts to Android phones are slower and grainy. It also maintains those messages in green bubbles, creating a kind of class divide, critics argue. In November, the company said it will add new features, such as read receipts, typing indicators, better support for group chats and higher quality media sharing of images and videos, across platforms to help close the gap. Apple\u2019s move to add support for the standard called RCS (rich communication services) is intended to roll out later this year. RCS is considered the replacement to alternatives such as SMS, or short messaging service, and can work over both Wi-Fi and mobile data. The change followed pressure from both regulators and competitors to more seamlessly work across operating systems. The European Union\u2019s Digital Markets Act, for example, requires companies to make their key services interoperable between platforms. The US government could require the same. More open services Another likely change is how hardware from other companies, such as smartwatches, will interact with the Apple range of devices and software, including the iPhone and Apple\u2019s services like Fitness+. The company has also required Apple Watch users to own iOS devices as a way to keep them locked into its existing ecosystem. Chatterjee said making this change would have both positives and negatives. \u201cThe net result would reside somewhere along the spectrum of access to more and cheaper options but also the devaluation of the customer experience that is so highly prized by Apple\u2019s customers,\u201d he said. The Biden administration has also taken issue with Apple\u2019s lack of support for mobile cloud services. Loosening this could allow users to access games and other cloud-based apps without having to pay for pricey hardware. Inside the debate The DOJ lawsuit claims Apple\u2019s behavior has illegally hindered competition, kept its customers locked into its products and prevented other companies from innovating. Although the Biden administration will have to prove these harms, some critics say any potential changes Apple could make will negatively impact the user experience. David McQueen, a research director at ABI Research, said he recognizes that the content and applications market should be open, and Apple needs to avoid monopolistic advantages that can restrict competition, push up prices or block innovation. But Apple\u2019s success stems in part to its tight grip on its products and services, keeping things intuitive and seamless. \u201cIf Apple is forced to comply, it could potentially spell the end to the provision of this consistent and unified user experience, although by the same token, consumers will be open to a greater choice of apps and services, helping more developers and providers,\u201d McQueen said. Chatterjee noted some people are drawn to the Apple family of products precisely because of the carefully managed ecosystem\u2019s ease of use. Apple may have to work that much harder to preserve the integrity of its experience, but any changes probably won\u2019t be enough to make customers to leave and go elsewhere. \u201cThe vast majority of Apple customers would probably be happier with some more choice and lower prices as long as it did not hamper their levels of customer experience, which is threatened by the less control Apple has over the experience,\u201d Chatterjee said. But he added those currently outside of the Apple ecosystem will likely benefit by \u201cplugging in opportunistically without having to go all in with Apple.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_07_tech_nvidia-jenson-huang-taiwan-computex-hnk-intl", "text": "When Nvidia surpassed Apple this week to become America\u2019s second most valuable company, its CEO Jensen Huang was being feted like a rockstar in his birthplace Taiwan. Wearing his signature black leather jacket, Huang spoke Sunday at a packed stadium in the capital Taipei, highlighting the island\u2019s importance in building the infrastructure that underpins artificial intelligence (AI) technology, which has powered Nvidia\u2019s rise to the top. \u201cTaiwan is the unsung hero, a steadfast pillar of the world,\u201d he said onstage, gesturing to a graphic that showed the names of nearly 100 of the company\u2019s suppliers in Taiwan. Whether it was throwing the first pitch at a baseball game or visiting a night market, Huang\u2019s every move has been tracked by his fans, legions of followers on social media as well as a posse of TV cameras. Taiwan media has dubbed the phenomenon \u201cJensanity.\u201d He\u2019s not the only celebrity CEO in town. A parade of global tech glitterati \u2014 including Lisa Su of AMD (AMD), Pat Gelsinger of Intel (INTC) and Cristiano Amon of Qualcomm (QCOM) \u2014 also flocked to the city this week to attend Computex, an annual trade show. Started some 40 years ago as a showcase for Taiwan\u2019s burgeoning tech manufacturers, Computex isn\u2019t used to the limelight. For decades, it was a low-key sourcing fair for personal computers and other consumer gadgets. That was before the launch of ChatGPT by OpenAI in late 2022. Since then, the global competition to create generative AI applications has led to soaring demand for the cutting edge chips used in data centers to support these programs. Neither Nvidia (NVDA) nor AMD, run by CEOs who also happen to be cousins, manufacture their own semiconductors. The job of producing their most advanced chips is outsourced to Taiwan-based TSMC, which makes an estimated 90% of the world\u2019s super-advanced chips. That has elevated the island\u2019s position as a key player in the AI revolution \u2014 and suddenly made Computex the hottest ticket in town. \u201cTech CEOs are visiting Taiwan both to cement their relationships with the island\u2019s chip manufactures and server assemblers, but also to access the country\u2019s AI talent,\u201d Christopher Miller, author of \u201cChip War: The Fight for the World\u2019s Most Critical Technology,\u201d told CNN. Media frenzy CEOs of major global companies, especially consumer-facing ones, have usually opted for low-key trips to Taiwan or avoided the island altogether to avoid a backlash from Beijing. China\u2019s ruling Communist Party claims the self-governing democracy as its own, despite never having controlled it and has vowed to \u201creunify\u201d with it, by force if necessary. Huang has visited his birthplace regularly and raised eyebrows on this trip by his reference to the island. \u201cTaiwan is one of the most important countries in the world. It is at the center of the electronics industry. The computer industry is built because of Taiwan,\u201d he told a local reporter while visiting a night market. Beijing generally condemns any suggestion of statehood for Taiwan. And even though Huang\u2019s comment became a hotly trending topic on Chinese social media, the country\u2019s state media has stayed unusually quiet on the subject. \u201cThat\u2019s because they don\u2019t need us, but we need them,\u201d a Weibo user posted on China\u2019s microblogging service. The United States has imposed a number of restrictions on the export of AI chips to China. Late last year, Chinese tech giants like Tencent were rushing to stockpile AI chips before those curbs took hold. Nvidia, which is reportedly developing new chips for the Chinese market to comply with US export curbs, has said the rules would result in a \u201cpermanent loss of opportunities\u201d for US industry. Shrugging off geopolitics Shortly before Computex opened, Taiwan was encircled by Chinese warships and fighter jets in the largest military exercises in over a year. The drills took place just days after the island swore in its new president, Lai Ching-te, who is openly loathed by Beijing for championing the island\u2019s sovereignty and distinct identity. The CEOs at Computex seemed to shrug off the continuing political tensions, which have persisted for several years and put pressure on TSMC to expand outside Taiwan in order to diversify its production base. \u201cWe do a lot of our manufacturing here,\u201d AMD\u2019s Su told CNN. \u201cTaiwan in particular is very important to the semiconductor ecosystem.\u201d Huang also touted his firm\u2019s close ties with the island. \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing technology, doing engineering, and conducting business here in Taiwan for almost three decades, and we\u2019re going to continue to do so,\u201d he told CNN. That said, the chip shortage during the Covid-19 pandemic as well as the increasing strategic importance of the industry due to the rivalry between the US and China have prompted calls to revive chip manufacturing in America. In 2022, US President Joe Biden signed the Chips and Science Act into law, aiming to boost domestic production of chips, which stands at about 10% of the global supply, and reducing reliance on Asia for the most advanced kind of chips needed for artificial intelligence technologies. Gelsinger, CEO of Intel, told CNN at a media briefing that there has been a \u201cmanufacturing resurgence\u201d after the bill was signed. \u201cWe have great respect for the ecosystem here in Taiwan \u2026 But the world needs more geographically balanced and resilient supply chain, and I think it\u2019s starting to take shape,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/tech/nvidia-jenson-huang-taiwan-computex-hnk-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "business"}}

But the emotion I feel most strongly right now is gratitude.\u201d She has helped lead the foundation since 2000, with the organization making nearly $78 billion worth of grant payments in the nearly 25 years since its founding. French Gates told employees the \u201cimpact you and our partners are having in the world could not be more important,\u201d listing off the accomplishments including kids having healthier lives, more women with personal bank accounts, and more \u201cfarmers coaxing lifechanging surpluses out of small family plots.\u201d \u201cSometimes, depending on where we sit in the organization, that impact can feel far away from our day-to-day activities,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBut after twenty-five years of traveling on behalf of this foundation to see our partners in action, I can assure you that it is real \u2014 and it\u2019s in no small part because of you.\u201d French Gates\u2019 exit had been telegraphed for several years. Bill Gates and French Gates\u00a0announced their divorce\u00a0in May 2021. They said at the time they would allow themselves a kind of trial period through 2023 to determine if they could continue working with one another to oversee their massive charitable foundation. Last month, she announced her exit. As part of her separation agreement from former husband Bill, French Gates said she will receive an additional $12.5 billion for her charitable work. She explained that her departure from the foundation stemmed from her reaction to the US Supreme Court\u2019s 2022 Dobbs decision that let individual states decide abortion rights. The philanthropist felt compelled to offer Americans financial support for their reproductive freedoms \u2014 support that she says she had been giving exclusively overseas. \u201cWhile I have long focused on improving contraceptive access overseas, in the post-Dobbs era, I now feel compelled to support reproductive rights here at home,\u201d French Gates said in an op-ed in late May in the\u00a0New York Times.

{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl", "text": "Sam Altman has agreed to return to lead OpenAI, the company said in a Tuesday post on X, just days after his surprise ouster as chief executive sparked an employee revolt that threatened to undermine what has been the leading company in the fledgling artificial intelligence industry. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman wrote that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft, which is the ChatGPT maker\u2019s biggest financial backer. The announcement appears to bring to an end days of chaos for the AI industry that included negotiations over who should lead OpenAI and how the firm should be run, as well as broader discussions about just how fast the arms race to develop AI technology should be moving. The details of Altman\u2019s firing and re-hiring remain murky. In its announcement Friday, OpenAI claimed that Altman had been insufficiently \u201ccandid\u201d with the board. That ambiguous language sent the rumor mill flying. But a key factor in Altman\u2019s ouster was the presence of\u00a0tensions between Altman, who favored pushing AI development more aggressively, and members of the original OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the crisis. As of Monday morning, Nadella had announced that Altman, along with fellow OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, would be joining Microsoft to lead a new AI research division. OpenAI said it had hired former Twitch chief Emmett Shear as interim CEO. But then hundreds of OpenAI employees, nearly the company\u2019s entire staff, threatened to leave, potentially for Microsoft, if the company\u2019s board didn\u2019t resign and reinstate Altman as CEO. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it invested billions in to help bolster its ambitions in developing AI, which many in Silicon Valley think will be the most important wave of technological advancement in the coming decades. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Microsoft CEO\u00a0Satya Nadella said on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d Altman\u2019s vision to quickly roll out and commercialize AI tools also appears to have won out. Publicly, Altman has long cautioned about risks posed by AI, and he\u202fhas pledged to lawmakers and customers that he would move OpenAI forward responsibly. \u201cIs [AI] gonna be like the printing press that diffused knowledge, power and learning widely across the landscape that empowered ordinary, everyday individuals that led to greater flourishing, that led above all to greater liberty?\u201d he said in a May Senate subcommittee hearing pressing for regulation. \u201cOr is it gonna be more like the atom bomb \u2014 huge technological breakthrough, but the consequences (severe, terrible) continue to haunt us to this day?\u201d But inside the company, Altman had been pushing to bring products to market more quickly and to sell them for a profit. Altman announced a few weeks ago at OpenAI\u2019s first-ever developer day that the company would make tools available so anyone could create their own version of ChatGPT. OpenAI has also worked with Microsoft to roll out ChatGPT-like technology across Microsoft\u2019s products. OpenAI and iPhone designer Jony Ive had also reportedly\u202fbeen in talks to raise $1 billion from Japanese conglomerate SoftBank for an AI device to replace the smartphone. \u2014 CNN\u2019s Juliana Liu and Diksha Madhok contributed reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_20_success_interest-rates-savings-cash", "text": "The Federal Reserve\u2019s benchmark interest rate remains at a 23-year high. That\u2019s thanks to the central bank\u2019s decision Wednesday to once again hold it steady, as it has done at the policy-making committee\u2019s past five meetings. That decision may be disappointing to some investors, homebuyers and those with a lot of credit card debt, since movement in the Fed\u2019s overnight lending rate influences rates \u2014 directly or indirectly \u2014 on consumer financial products (e.g., credit cards, bank loans and mortgages). But\u00a0with the Fed signaling that no rate cuts are likely until summer, it also means anyone with savings still has at least a few more months to make hay of their stash. That\u2019s because you can still get inflation-beating interest rates that will grow any money you have set aside for emergencies, vacations, down payments or any other goal in your sights over the next several years. However, that won\u2019t happen if you just let it sit in a traditional checking or savings account that yields next to nothing. There are more lucrative, low-risk options out there, with rates that are still at or near their peaks. \u201cBut perhaps not for much longer,\u201d said Ted Rossman, senior analyst at Bankrate. \u201cIf one of those fits into your financial plans, it\u2019s best to act soon.\u201d So, consider the following options when deciding where to park your hard-earned savings. High-yield online savings accounts The average annual percentage yield on bank savings accounts was just 0.52% as of March 13, according to Bankrate. That average is kept low by the biggest brick-and-mortar banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, which still are offering a paltry 0.01%. By contrast, there are still FDIC-insured online banks offering inflation-beating rates of between 4.35% and 5.35% on their high-yield savings accounts. Generally speaking, these are the best vehicles in which to keep your emergency funds for quick, easy access. Choosing between an account that pays 0.52% and one that pays 5.35% can mean forfeiting hundreds of dollars in interest. \u201cIf you put $10,000 in a savings account, that\u2019s a difference of $496 in interest earnings over the course of the year, assuming monthly compounding,\u201d Rossman said. While the rates on high-yield savings accounts have gone down a bit in recent months, \u201cwidespread cuts in online savings account rates are unlikely until the first Fed rate cut is near,\u201d said Ken Tumin, founder of DepositAccounts.com. As with any bank savings rate, high-yield savings account\u00a0rates\u00a0can change overnight, and the bank may not alert you when it lowers it. So make sure to check your monthly statement. Certificates of deposits Another high-return, low-risk investment that is great for money you likely won\u2019t need to tap for a few months or even a couple of years is a certificate of deposit. You can get the best returns on CDs through a brokerage such as Schwab, E*Trade or Fidelity. That\u2019s because you can comparison shop for CDs from any number of FDIC-insured banks and will not have to set up individual accounts with each institution. As of March 13, the average rate on a one-year CD was 1.95%, but some banks are offering as much are 5.4%. If you can get a one-year CD at, say, 5.4%, you will make $540 on a $10,000 investment. To get the greatest benefit from a CD, you have to leave the money invested for a fixed period. You can always access your principal sooner if you need to, but there may be early withdrawal penalties. As of March 20, CDs listed on Schwab.com with durations from three months up to three years were all yielding between 5.2% and 5.51%. CD rates on durations between four and 10 years ranged from 4.40% to 5.15%. Say you invest $10,000 in a one-year CD with a 5.36%\u00a0APY. At the end of that period, you\u2019d get your principal back plus $536 in interest when the CD matures, according to Bankrate\u2019s CD calculator. If you chose a two-year CD at 5.25%, you\u2019d bank an extra $1,078, assuming compounding interest. The same investment in a five-year CD at 5.15% would earn $2,854. \u201cIt makes sense to go long with CDs. To hedge your bets, include terms from one to five years. Starting a CD ladder will provide this mix,\u201d Tumin said. If you don\u2019t go through a brokerage you may get a reasonable deal from your primary bank, Tumin said. For example, he noted, Wells Fargo is still offering up to 5.01% on both 4-month and 7-month CDs. Or, at Bank of America, you can get up to 4.75% on a 7-month CD. But Tumin cautions that with any big bank CD you should take your money out at the end of the term, otherwise your bank may automatically renew it and lock you in to a much lower-yielding CD. Money market accounts and funds If you don\u2019t want to set up an online savings account at another bank, your own bank may offer you a money market deposit account that pays a higher yield than your regular checking or savings accounts. Money market accounts may have higher minimum deposit requirements than a regular savings account, but they are more liquid than a fixed-term certificate of deposit or Treasury bill, meaning they give you access to your money more quickly while still potentially giving you some of the highest yields available, said Doug Ornstein, senior manager for integrated solutions at TIAA Wealth Management. But don\u2019t confuse money market accounts with money market mutual funds, which invest in short-term, low-risk debt instruments. As of March 19, they had an average 7-day yield of 5.14%, according to the Crane Money Fund Index, which tracks the top 100 taxable money market funds. Unlike money market deposit accounts, money market mutual funds are not insured by the FDIC. But if you invest in a money market fund through a brokerage, your overall account is likely to be insured through the Securities Investor Protection Corp, which offers protection in the event your brokerage ever goes under. Treasury bills and notes Another option for money you can leave untouched anywhere from several months to a few years is to buy short-term Treasury bills and medium-term notes, which are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. Three- and six-month bills had yields of 5.39% and 5.33%\u00a0respectively on March 20 before the Fed\u2019s meeting ended, while nine-month and one-year bills were offering 5.19% and 5.08%\u00a0respectively, according to rates posted on Schwab.com for a $25,000 investment. Rates on Treasury notes with durations from two years to 10 years ranged between 4.29% and 4.72%. If you\u2019re someone who manages your portfolio like a hawk, you may feel comfortable buying T-bills on your own from TreasuryDirect.gov. But if you don\u2019t, it might be easier just to buy new issues through your brokerage account or invest in a short-term bond index fund or ETF, said Andy Smith, executive director of financial planning at Edelman Financial Engines. And if you\u2019re looking at money that will be needed in three to five years, you might consider a diversified fund of highly rated government and corporate bonds, Ornstein said. An 18-month AAA-rated corporate bond, for instance, was yielding 4.82% this week, while the three-year was at 4.49%. Meanwhile, three-year AAA-rated municipal bonds (which are issued by local governments) had a rate of 3.98%, according to Schwab.com. Don\u2019t chase yield When deciding on the best accounts and investments for your specific goals and peace of mind, it may pay to consult a fee-only fiduciary adviser \u2014 meaning, someone who doesn\u2019t get paid a commission to sell you a particular investment. What you\u2019ll always want to do is build in flexibility for yourself so you can easily access cash, regardless of your timeline for key goals. \u201cWhat happens if something changes and you need that down payment a lot sooner \u2014 or your parents need medical care fast?\u201d Smith said. That means balancing your desire for great yield with a need and desire for ease of access without penalty. Translation: Don\u2019t chase yield for yield\u2019s sake. Think of it this way, Ornstein said: Unless you have huge sums to invest or are an institutional investor, the difference between getting a 5.1% yield versus 5% is negligible, and in fact it could even cost you more if there are penalties for taking your money out early. \u201cMost of the time convenience is really important. Give up the 0.1%,\u201d he advised.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/20/success/interest-rates-savings-cash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk", "text": "In a year of wild tech stories that has seen Elon Musk transform Twitter, cryptocurrency exchange FTX collapse and Silicon Valley Bank implode, this week\u2019s whiplash-inducing turmoil at OpenAI is among the most captivating. Sam Altman \u2014 the leader of one of the world\u2019s most influential AI companies, OpenAI, and perhaps the\u00a0most visible figure in the fledgling industry \u2014 was fired Friday night by the startup\u2019s directors in a surprise move. Less than five days later, he\u2019s back as the company\u2019s CEO, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. The series of extraordinary events unfolded just days after OpenAI held its\u00a0first-ever developer conference, where it laid out new, commercialized versions of its technology, including the option to customize its ChatGPT AI chatbot. If you\u2019re just catching up, here\u2019s what you missed from a week so incredible you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking the script could have been written by an early version of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Friday Around 3 p.m. ET, Altman joined a Google Meet call with most of OpenAI\u2019s board that had been convened by fellow co-founder and OpenAI chief scientist\u00a0Ilya Sutskever, during which Altman was fired and told that the news would soon be made public. Within the next half hour, the board also informed Greg Brockman, another co-founder and OpenAI president, that he would be removed from the board. Around 3:30 p.m. ET, OpenAI publicly announced that it had fired Altman over concerns that he was not always truthful with the board. The board said Mira Murati, the company\u2019s chief technology officer, would become interim CEO. OpenAI\u2019s strategic partners, including its biggest financial backer Microsoft, were also reportedly informed of Altman\u2019s ouster just minutes before the board\u2019s announcement. Hours after being fired, Altman posted on X that he \u201cloved working with such talented people\u201d and that he would have \u201cmore to say about what\u2019s next later.\u201d Brockman promptly quit. \u201cPlease don\u2019t spend any time being concerned. We will be fine,\u201d Brockman\u00a0said in a Friday post\u00a0on X. \u201cGreater things coming soon.\u201d A key factor in the CEO\u2019s firing was\u00a0tension between Altman, who favored developing AI\u00a0more aggressively, and members of the OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the unfolding events. Saturday Within 24 hours of Altman being fired, reports emerged that he and other ex-OpenAI loyalists were mulling plans for their own venture. OpenAI\u2019s board was also reportedly having second thoughts and considering asking the ousted CEO to return. Sunday By Sunday afternoon, Altman was\u00a0back at OpenAI\u2019s headquarters\u00a0\u2014 this time with a guest badge \u2014 to negotiate his potential return. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reportedly mediated the discussion. A 5 p.m. PT deadline was reportedly set for the board to agree to Altman\u2019s demands, including adding a seat for Microsoft, and reinstating him as CEO. But those talks broke down. As Sunday turned into Monday, Nadella tweeted that Altman, along with Brockman, would join Microsoft to run a new AI research group. At OpenAI, the group found a new interim CEO: Emmett Shear, the former CEO of Amazon\u2019s streaming service, Twitch. Murati would return to her role as OpenAI\u2019s chief technology officer. Monday In a post on X early Monday, Shear, who left his role at Twitch in March, described the chance to join OpenAI as \u201ca once-in-a-lifetime\u201d opportunity. He added that the company would hire an independent investigator to report on what happened in the lead-up to Altman\u2019s firing. But OpenAI employees were not convinced. More than 500 staffers signed an open letter calling on the company\u2019s board to resign and reinstate Altman and Brockman. They also threatened to follow the co-founders to Microsoft if their demands were not met. Altman posted on X, saying, \u201cwe have more unity and commitment and focus than ever before. we are all going to work together some way or other, and i\u2019m so excited. one team, one mission.\u201d The drama was far from over.\u00a0The Verge reported Monday afternoon\u00a0that Altman and Brockman could still return to OpenAI if the board members who fired him resign. And Nadella, speaking to CNBC, said he was \u201copen to both options\u201d when asked whether Altman would actually join Microsoft. \u201cLook, that is for the OpenAI board and management and the employees to choose,\u201d Nadella said. \u201cWe chose to explicitly partner with OpenAI and we want to continue to do so, and obviously, that depends on the people of OpenAI staying there or coming to Microsoft.\u201d Tuesday Altman\u00a0was reinstated late Tuesday as OpenAI\u2019s CEO, the company said on X. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman\u00a0wrote\u00a0that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his\u00a0post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it has backed with billions to bolster its ambitions in developing AI. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Nadella\u00a0said\u00a0on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_07_media_washington-post-will-lewis-newsroom-morale", "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:\u00a0A version of this article first appeared in the \u201cReliable Sources\u201d newsletter.\u00a0Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here. Will Lewis\u00a0is quickly losing the confidence of his newsroom. The chief executive and publisher of\u00a0The Washington Post, who took the helm of the venerable newspaper in January \u2014 and was initially welcomed by staffers with cautious optimism \u2014 has over the course of the last several days alienated his troops and raised larger questions about his fitness to run one of the nation\u2019s most prestigious news organizations. At The Post, according to more than a half-dozen staffers who spoke with CNN Thursday, morale has fallen off a cliff since Lewis abruptly ousted Executive Editor\u00a0Sally Buzbee\u00a0on Sunday. \u201cIt\u2019s as bad as I\u2019ve ever seen it, truly,\u201d one staffer said Thursday, noting that The Post has hit \u201crough patches\u201d before, but that the stormy atmosphere hanging over the Washington outlet is unprecedented. Lewis\u2019 uncouth dispatching of Buzbee poisoned much of the goodwill he had earned with his employees over the preceding six months. Indeed, the day after he announced Buzbee\u2019s exit, staffers pressed him in a town hall about the circumstances that led to her departure. While staffers who spoke with CNN have praised\u00a0Matt Murray, the former top editor at\u00a0The Wall Street Journal\u00a0who will lead the newsroom through the election, they have raised serious concerns about the appointment of\u00a0Fleet Street\u00a0veteran\u00a0Robert Winnett, who will take the reins after the conclusion of the presidential contest. But Lewis and his team of spokespeople (he has a personal representative, in addition to those who handle public relations on behalf of the outlet), would have likely been able to contain the mess, if it were to have remained isolated. Unfortunately for Lewis, it did not. Buzbee\u2019s ouster led to the revelation that weeks beforehand Lewis had pressured her to refrain from publishing a story about his alleged involvement in the\u00a0U.K.\u00a0phone hacking scandal. At the time of the scandal, which engulfed\u00a0Rupert Murdoch\u2019s\u00a0media empire and was revived by a new\u00a0Prince Harry\u00a0lawsuit, Lewis was a senior executive at\u00a0News Corporation, a position that has left an indelible stain on his resume. Lewis has denied wrongdoing in the hacking scandal. Regardless, the coverup often can be worse than the crime. And so, when\u00a0The New York Times\u00a0first reported the news\u00a0about the pressure Lewis had applied to Buzbee, which CNN has since confirmed, all hell broke loose inside The Post. The story sparked a wave of fear that was only exacerbated by a follow-up story published by veteran\u00a0NPR\u00a0media reporter\u00a0David Folkenlik, who\u00a0disclosed Thursday\u00a0that Lewis \u201crepeatedly \u2014 and heatedly \u2014 offered to give\u201d him an \u201cexclusive interview about The Post\u2019s future,\u201d so long as he dropped a story about the phone hacking allegations. Folkenflik said a spokesperson for Lewis confirmed to him \u201cthat an explicit offer was on the table: drop the story, get the interview.\u201d Folkenflik, of course, did not drop the story. Lewis\u2019 first interview ultimately went to\u00a0Puck\u2019s Dylan Byers. (Byers told CNN Thursday night that no restrictions were placed around the interview, and he would \u201chave never agreed to anything like that.\u201d) Which is why one might have thought that Lewis, who surely must sense the trust of his staffers quickly slipping away, would have offered a mea culpa of sorts on Thursday night. Apologize, vow to do better, etcetera. ChatGPT could have written the note for him! But instead, bizarrely, Lewis has chosen to go a very different route. Suffice to say, the behavior demonstrated by Lewis up until that point was alarming and raised serious questions about his judgment. As one veteran media executive told CNN Thursday, playing off The Post\u2019s \u201cdemocracy dies in darkness\u201d tagline, \u201cDemocracy dies in pressuring editors to drop stories about publishers.\u201d One doesn\u2019t need to go to\u00a0Columbia Journalism School\u00a0to know that the head of a newsroom should not be trying to intimidate journalists from publishing unflattering stories about themselves. It\u00a0is obviously inappropriate! In\u00a0astonishing comments\u00a0sent to The Post\u2019s\u00a0Sarah Ellison\u00a0and\u00a0Elahe Izadi, Lewis went nuclear on Folkenflik. Lewis referred to the NPR media reporter, widely considered to be one of the best in the industry, as \u201can activist, not a journalist.\u201d Lewis added, \u201cI had an off the record conversation with him before I joined you at The Post and some six months later he has dusted it down, and made up some excuse to make a story of a non-story.\u201d Additionally, Ellison and Izadi reported that Lewis had \u201cexpressed his disapproval with The Post\u2019s recent reporting on his leadership change.\u201d When asked later to identify inaccuracies, Lewis replied, \u201cForgive me, there has been a lot written by various people. You may well have captured this accurately.\u201d Folkenflik responded to Lewis\u2019 below-the-belt insult Thursday night. In a statement, Folkenflik said that while Lewis may call him an activist, his own newsroom has found his reporting \u201con this to be newsworthy.\u201d \u201cAs he stated, we had an agreement to have an off the record conversation about the subject I was reporting on late last year,\u201d Folkenflik told me. \u201cThat agreement did not cover his efforts to induce me to kill my story. What was off the record was our discussion of his alleged role in covering up the hacking scandal.\u201d Folkenflik added that Lewis \u201cdid not deny making the offers\u201d to him. How Lewis cleans up this mammoth of a mess that he has created for himself remains to be seen. Can he do it? One wonders what\u00a0Jeff Bezos, the billionaire owner of The Post, who must be growing quite tired of constantly seeing his newspaper ensnared in controversy, thinks of the situation. Inside the newsroom, though, the sentiment is plain as day. \u201cHe\u2019s really losing the newsroom on a large scale,\u201d a staffer said, sizing up the state of affairs. \u201cPeople don\u2019t trust him, don\u2019t believe he has the same values and ethics as our journalists and there are major concerns of how far he would go to censor or shut down coverage.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/media/washington-post-will-lewis-newsroom-morale/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_07_tech_mike-lynch-acquitted-fraud-hewlett-packard", "text": "Autonomy founder Mike\u00a0Lynch\u00a0was acquitted of fraud Thursday by a jury in San Francisco, a major win for the software entrepreneur who has been dogged by legal problems since the disastrous sale of his company to Hewlett-Packard (HP)\u00a0for $11 billion in 2011. Representatives for\u00a0Lynch\u00a0and US prosecutors said\u00a0Lynch\u00a0was acquitted on all 15 charges \u2014 one count of conspiracy and 14 counts of wire fraud. Former Autonomy finance executive Stephen Chamberlain, who faced the same charges at trial alongside\u00a0Lynch, was also acquitted on all counts, the\u00a0Lynch\u00a0representative said. The trial, where prosecutors said\u00a0Lynch\u00a0and Chamberlain schemed to inflate Autonomy\u2019s revenue, was the latest chapter in a legal saga stemming from the failed deal. The Autonomy sale was one of the biggest British tech deals at the time but quickly went sour, with HP writing down Autonomy\u2019s value by $8.8 billion within a year. \u201cI am elated with today\u2019s verdict,\u201d\u00a0Lynch, who was once compared with Apple\u2019s Steve Jobs and Microsoft\u2019s\u00a0Bill Gates, said in a statement. \u201cI am looking forward to returning to the UK and getting back to what I love most: my family and innovating in my field.\u201d Abraham Simmons, a spokesperson for the Office of the United States Attorney,\u00a0said: \u201cWe acknowledge and respect the verdict.\u201d Cambridge roots At the trial, which lasted three months, jurors heard from more than 30 government witnesses including Leo Apotheker, the former HP (HPE) CEO who was fired weeks after the Autonomy deal was announced. Cambridge University-educated Lynch\u00a0also\u00a0took the stand\u00a0in his own defense at the trial, denying wrongdoing and telling jurors that HP botched the two companies\u2019 integration. Prosecutors said\u00a0Lynch\u00a0and Chamberlain padded Autonomy\u2019s finances in several ways, including via back-dated agreements and fake contracts. Lynch\u2019s legal team argued at trial that HP was so eager to acquire Autonomy ahead of potential competitors that it rushed through due diligence before the sale. On the stand, the entrepreneur said he had been focused on tech issues, and entrusted money matters and the accounting decisions at issue to Sushovan Hussain, Autonomy\u2019s then-chief financial officer.\u00a0Hussain was separately convicted\u00a0in 2018 at a trial in the same court on charges related to the deal with HP. He was released from US prison in January after serving a five-year sentence. Lynch\u00a0turned ground-breaking research at Cambridge University into the foundation of Autonomy, which became Britain\u2019s biggest software company and a member of the blue-chip FTSE 100 index. He was lauded by academics and scientists and asked to advise the British government on technology and innovation. The Autonomy acquisition was meant to fuel HP\u2019s software business. Instead, it spawned a series of bitter and expensive legal battles.\u00a0HP largely won a civil lawsuit\u00a0against\u00a0Lynch\u00a0and Hussain in London in 2022, though damages have not yet been decided.

{"id": "2024_06_06_media_washington-post-will-lewis-npr", "text": "William Lewis, the new publisher and chief executive of The Washington Post, reportedly tried to kill\u00a0a\u00a0story\u00a0about his alleged involvement in a UK phone hacking scandal coverup, offering an NPR reporter an interview in exchange for squashing the\u00a0forthcoming article. The decade-old UK scandal that engulfed right-wing media mogul Rupert Murdoch\u2019s \u201cNews of the World\u201d tabloid, was revived in recent years in a\u00a0new lawsuit filed\u00a0by Prince Harry and other notable figures including Guy Ritchie and Hugh Grant. At the time, Lewis was a senior executive at Murdoch\u2019s News Corporation. He has repeatedly denied wrongdoing. On Thursday, veteran NPR media reporter David Folkenflik\u00a0reported\u00a0that in December, Lewis, who had just been named publisher and chief executive of the Post, offered him an exclusive interview in exchange for his willingness not to publish a story on Lewis\u2019 potential involvement in the scandal. \u201cIn several conversations, Lewis repeatedly \u2014 and heatedly \u2014offered to give me an exclusive interview about the\u00a0Post\u2019s future, as long as I dropped the story about the allegations,\u201d Folkenflik reported. \u201cAt that time, the same spokesperson, who works directly for Lewis from the U.K. and has advised him since his days at the\u00a0Wall Street Journal \u2014\u00a0confirmed to me that an explicit offer was on the table: drop the story, get the interview.\u201d The Washington Post did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment. Despite Lewis\u2019 attempt to squash the story, NPR\u00a0published the article\u00a0in late December under the headline \u201cNew \u2018Washington Post\u2019 CEO accused of Murdoch tabloid hacking cover-up,\u201d featuring a 2011 photo of Lewis with Murdoch. The revelation came a day after The New York Times reported that Lewis had\u00a0clashed in recent weeks\u00a0with former Post executive editor Sally Buzbee over a decision to publish an article in May about the hacking scandal that named Lewis. According to the Times, Lewis told Buzbee the story didn\u2019t warrant coverage in the newspaper. \u201cWhen Ms. Buzbee said The Post would publish an article anyway, he said her decision represented a lapse in judgment and abruptly ended the conversation,\u201d\u00a0the Times reported. A person with knowledge of Buzbee\u2019s account confirmed the conversation to CNN, adding that the then-executive editor felt pressured by Lewis over the story. Days later, when the judge in the UK case allowed allegations about Lewis to be included in the lawsuit, the Post\u00a0published another story\u00a0naming him. On Sunday night, the Post\u00a0abruptly announced\u00a0Buzbee was departing the newspaper and was being immediately replaced by former Wall Street Journal editor Matt Murray in a seismic shakeup at the outlet. \u201cSally is an incredible leader and a supremely talented media executive who will be sorely missed,\u201d Lewis said in\u00a0a statement.\u00a0\u201cI wish her all the best going forward.\u201d Notably, Buzbee did not offer a farewell note to staff. Staffers at the Post who spoke to CNN on condition of anonymity said that newsroom morale had plummeted in the wake Buzbee\u2019s departure and published reports about Lewis. \u201cIt\u2019s increasingly tense,\u201d one Post staffer said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t do himself any favors with some of his flippant remarks. Now you add in the potential for quid pro quos, and there are ethics issues at play, too.\u201d The news comes two weeks after Lewis\u00a0unveiled a new plan\u00a0to turn around the beleaguered newspaper, telling staff the company had lost $77 million over the last year and seen a dramatic 50% plunge in audience traffic since 2020. \u201cTo speak candidly,\u201d Lewis told staffers, \u201cwe are in a hole, and we have been for some time.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/media/washington-post-will-lewis-npr/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_12_success_equal-pay-day-2024", "text": "March 12 marks Equal Pay Day in the United States, a symbolic date representing the number of days women have to work into the current year just to make the same amount of money men made in the prior one. Put another way, to make 12 months\u2019 worth of a man\u2019s median wages, a woman has to work about 14.5 months. In dollars and cents, for every dollar a man earns, a woman is paid 84 cents, according to the National Committee on Pay Equity and the Equal Pay Today campaign. That\u2019s based on earnings data for full-time, year-round workers from the US Census in 2022, which was the most recent full-year data set available. If part-time workers and those not employed year-round are included, the gender pay gap is worse, at 78 cents on the dollar, said Deborah Vagins, national campaign director of Equal Rights Advocates and director of Equal Pay Today. The size of the actual wage gap between men and women will widen or narrow depending on age, level of education, choice of occupation and tenure, as well as race and ethnicity. The gender pay gap is typically widest when comparing the earnings of White men to Black, Hispanic or Native American women. And, generally speaking, the gap is narrower in a given job when men and women are in their early- to mid-20s (i.e., when they are new to the workforce and before children come along), and also when comparing wages by title, tenure and education level within a given field. But no matter how you slice and dice the data, there are very few scenarios in which women on average earn the same as men. Indeed, in its latest analysis of median weekly earnings last year by occupation, the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research found that women earned less than men not only in all 20 of the largest occupations for men but also in all 20 of the largest occupations for women. Among the largest occupations for women, the most egregious pay gaps were among financial managers (women earned 71% of every dollar a man earns), retail salesperson (72%), education and child care administrators (79%), administrative assistants (80%) and managers (81%). The narrowest gap was among cashiers, where women almost have pay parity (98%) with their male colleagues. Same old (and annoying) story every year While the overall gender pay gap has been narrowing over time \u2014 for example, Equal Pay Day in 2005 was April 19, a full five weeks later than this year\u2019s \u2014 the very fact that \ufeffsuch a gap exists at all in 2024 is a reminder that employers and society still have work to do in recognizing the value of women\u2019s contributions at work. \u201cThe gender wage gap is a national disgrace,\u201d said\u00a0Jamila Taylor, IWPR\u2019s president and CEO, in a statement. \u201cEven in professions typically dominated by women, men earn more for doing the same job. Equal pay for equal work has been the law of the land for more than a half-century, yet\u00a0women still cannot get fair treatment when it comes to employment and earnings. And it\u2019s worse for women of color, who face rampant racial discrimination in the workforce in addition to ongoing pay inequities.\u201d The good news is that there are now multiple efforts that may over time help reduce the problem. They include an increasing number of state-level pay transparency laws and bans on employers asking job candidates for their salary histories, which can help chronically underpaid women gain more of an equal footing when they apply for new jobs. There is also now a ban on federal government agencies asking job candidates\u2019 for their salary history and a proposed rule that would prohibit federal contractors from doing the same, as well as requiring them to post in their job ads the pay for given positions. But Vagins and others in the campaign for equal pay also want to see action at the federal legislative level, supporting two bills: the Salary Transparency Act and the Paycheck Fairness Act, which have been introduced in the US House and Senate multiple times. For instance, the Paycheck Fairness Act would, according to Equal Pay Today, \u201cbar retaliation against workers who voluntarily discuss or disclose their wages; close loopholes that have allowed employers to pay women less than men for the same work \u2026 [and] ensure women can receive the same robust remedies for sex-based pay discrimination that are currently available to those subjected to discrimination based on race and ethnicity.\u201d Absent such federal laws requiring all employers to make equal pay more of an imperative, Vagins said, achieving true pay parity for women will be slow in coming.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/12/success/equal-pay-day-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "business"}}

Seat control switches on the front power seats of the SUVs can become misaligned and stuck if they\u2019re hit hard by something, according to recall documents filed with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. If that happens, a small electric motor that moves the seat can run continuously and overheat. The recall involves 2020 through 2024 Kia Telluride models. The Telluride, a roomy SUV with three rows of seats, has been an extremely popular model for the Korean automaker. Designed in California and built in Georgia, the Telluride was created specifically to appeal to Americans. When it first came out, dealers were unable to keep enough in stock for customers. The problem was first noticed by Kia in 2022 when a customer reported smoke coming from under their Telluride\u2019s driver seat, according to a timeline Kia provided NHTSA. In 2023, another customer complained of a smoke smell from the passenger-side power seat, which wasn\u2019t working. Other similar cases were reported later that year. In 2024, at least one Kia owner reported that the driver\u2019s seat caught fire while they were driving. There have been no accidents or injuries as a result of the problem, according to Kia. An investigation by Kia concluded that the problem was with the power seat switches that could be damaged in a way that causes its motor to overheat. Kia will send recalled vehicle owners letters, starting at the end of July, asking them to bring their SUVs to a Kia dealership for repairs \u2014 at no cost. Service technicians at the dealers will install reinforcements and improved switches to prevent the seats from burning. Owners who suspect their Telluride might be involved can also call Kia customer service at 1-800-333-4542. Kia recalled more than 400,000 Tellurides earlier this year for a separate problem that could allow them to roll away while in park.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/business/kia-recalling-463000-telluride-suvs/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_07_economy_may-jobs-report-final", "text": "US job growth shot much higher than expected in May, jumping to 272,000, while the nation\u2019s jobless rate rose slightly and broke a 27-month streak of below-4% unemployment. At a time when Americans and the Federal Reserve are clamoring for clear-cut data about the state and trajectory of the economy, Friday\u2019s jobs report was much more opaque than everyone had hoped. \u201cIt\u2019s hard not to like a lot of jobs, and this report was well above what I expected, and I think just about what everyone expected,\u201d Dean Baker, an economist who co-founded the Center for Economic and Policy Research, told CNN. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot of job growth, that\u2019s a generally good story.\u201d He added: \u201cBut the Fed\u2019s going \u2018Oh, can we cut [interest rates]? Can we cut? Can we cut?\u2019 It\u2019s hard to look at this report and make a good case for cutting, I\u2019ve got to say.\u201d May\u2019s job gains are considerably higher than the April total, which was revised down to 165,000, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data released Friday. The May data came in well above expectations for 180,000, according to FactSet consensus estimates. The unemployment rate rose to 4% from 3.9%. It\u2019s the first time in more than two years that the jobless rate is not below 4%. Stronger-than-expected wage gains for the month pushed up average hourly earnings to 4.1% over the past year, reversing a monthslong trend of cooling there. \u201cThe Fed doesn\u2019t directly target wages; but where the wages picked up are in the areas where we\u2019ve seen the most inflation,\u201d Diane Swonk, chief economist with KPMG, told CNN. That\u2019s in the service sector, everything from personal care services, dry cleaning, cleaning and home maintenance and vehicle maintenance, she said. \u201cAnd that is something that is hard for the Fed, because in order for some of the increases we\u2019re seeing in the service sector, we need to see offset in goods prices in order to bring inflation down,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you need a lot of that consistently to deal with stickier inflation that we\u2019re seeing in the service sector; and, unfortunately, wages matter more in particular areas where inflation has gotten stickiest.\u201d Critical inflation data is due out Wednesday: The May Consumer Price Index lands the same day the Fed will make its latest policymaking announcement (which is overwhelmingly expected to be that they are keeping rates on hold). Traders weren\u2019t too giddy about Friday\u2019s\u00a0employment\u00a0report, at least when it comes to rate cut prospects. Wall Street\u2019s best bet for the first rate cut is now December, the CME FedWatch Tool shows. A tale of two surveys Friday\u2019s jobs report, at initial glance, appears to be a mixed bag both for Americans and the Fed, which is wanting to see a slowing in demand to help tamp down inflation. The strong job market has underpinned a robust period of consumer spending that has kept the economy churning \u2014 but has not necessarily helped in the inflation fight. The surge in job gains and the rising unemployment offer a tale of two surveys: The monthly\u00a0jobs\u00a0report is composed of two surveys to measure\u00a0employment\u00a0levels and activity, one that surveys non-farm businesses about\u00a0employment, hours and earnings, and the other of households to obtain the labor force status of the population with demographic details. Employment fell in the household survey, while unemployment increased to just shy of 6.5 million and pushing the unemployment rate to the threshold of 4%. However, the household survey typically is more volatile than the establishment survey that showed payroll gains jumping higher. \u201cIt is literally the height of confusion trying to make sense of one of the most divergent monthly employment reports that we can ever remember,\u201d economist Chris Rupkey, of FwdBonds, wrote in a note issued Friday. \u201cIs it safe out there for consumers and businesses or is the economy on the cusp of a recession?\u201d CEPR\u2019s Baker said the growing \u201cdissonance\u201d between the household and establishment surveys could be a reflection of the data not fully picking up the post-pandemic surge in immigration that economists say have increased the supply of workers and productivity, allowing for stronger job growth without being inflationary. \u201cThe immigrants are overwhelmingly working when they\u2019re coming here, and we have the data on that,\u201d Baker said. \u201cBut my best guess is we\u2019re not picking up the full impact of immigration with the population controls [of the BLS survey].\u201d Americans are still faring well Friday\u2019s jobs report may be a mixed bag at a time when the Fed is trying to rein in inflation; but from a historical standpoint, this current jobs market remains one for the record books. And from a current standpoint, one that\u2019s healthy for Americans who are trying their hardest to keep up with inflation. \u201cI think it still shows that there\u2019s still plenty of support within the labor market for people who depend on income for spending, which is obviously the vast majority of Americans,\u201d Thomas Simons, senior economist at Jeffries, said in an interview. Through May, the US economy has added an average of 247,800 jobs per month, which is roughly in line with the strong job growth seen last year. March\u2019s and April\u2019s estimated payroll gains were revised down slightly: March by 5,000 to 310,000; and April by 10,000 to 165,000. May marks the 41st consecutive month of job gains, extending what is the fifth longest streak on records that go back to 1939, BLS data shows. Service-providing industries accounted for the bulk of the month\u2019s job gains, with health care and social assistance continuing to lead the way, with 83,500 jobs added. Health care, government and leisure and hospitality accounted for 60% of May\u2019s gains; however, interest rate-sensitive sectors such as construction and manufacturing added jobs as well, Nick Bunker, economic research director for North America for the Indeed Hiring Lab, wrote in a note issued Friday. \u201cThe gains \ufeffare still broad-based,\u201d he said. The BLS\u2019 \u201cdiffusion index,\u201d which is a measurement of the percentage of industries that are adding or losing jobs, hit 63.4 in May, which is the highest it\u2019s been since January 2023. The labor market is still showing a lot of strength, Bunker said, noting that the increase in unemployment can be attributed to workers 24 and under, as prime-age employment rose. In fact, the labor force participation rate for prime working-age women (25-54 years old) set a fresh all-time high of 78.1% in May, BLS data shows. \u201cDon\u2019t get overly spooked by the rise in the unemployment rate,\u201d Bunker wrote. \u201cThe labor market is still gliding toward a soft landing.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/economy/may-jobs-report-final/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "business"}}

These service issues are getting old,\u201d said one social media user. \u201cWe better be getting more than a $5 credit. Otherwise I\u2019m going back to Verizon.\u201d Though outages can affect any company, it\u2019s not normal to have two long outages in a short period of time, Mojtaba Vaezi, a professor and director of the Wireless Networking Laboratory at Villanova University, said to CNN. \u201cIf it\u2019s something that\u2019s happening with a software update dysfunctioning with some systems, usually they have back-ups and people working around the clock,\u201d Vaezi said. \u201cWhen it takes longer than 10 to 15 minutes, it is alarming.\u201d Although AT&T did not share the number of impacted customers, website Down Detector shows\u00a0a spike in reports\u00a0of issues using the service starting around 1 pm ET on Tuesday. Those numbers climbed in the hours that followed. By 6 pm ET, however, the number of reported incidents sharply declined, according to Down Detector. The site listed New York City, Chicago, Philadelphia, Dallas, Pittsburgh and Indianapolis as among the cities with the most reports of issues. Because of the problem connecting to other carriers,\u00a0thousands of Verizon customers\u00a0also reported a service outage on Down Detector Tuesday. In a statement Tuesday, AT&T said it had resolved the outage and that calls between AT&T customers were not impacted. In February, a massive outage knocked out service for AT&T\u2019s network for nearly\u00a012 hours. Tens of thousands of AT&T customers in America could not make phone calls, send texts, reach emergency services or access the internet. At the time, the mobile network issued a $5 credit to impacted customers. Impact on customer trust Some subscribers complained that AT&T had waited too long to alert them of the outage, leaving them scrambling to figure out what happened. \u201cIt would be great if AT&T would notify customers of this problem before each of us wastes time trying to figure out what is wrong,\u201d said one Reddit user. Karen North, a communication professor at the University of Southern California who specializes in brand management and crisis communications, said AT&T\u2019s initial lack of communication may damage customer faith in the company. \u201cSilence is almost never the right answer when users are involved. People need to know what\u2019s happening and when it\u2019s going to be fixed,\u201d North said. AT&T told CNN on Tuesday that 911 calls were going through, despite a few locations, including Camden County, Georgia, and Scranton, Pennsylvania, issuing\u00a0alerts\u00a0on social media that the outage was disrupting calls to 911. AT&T told CNN the alerts were received accidentally and the company is investigating why that happened. After two consecutive outages and a March data breach, North said AT&T needs to work to regain customer trust. \u201cThey need to put out a very clear message about why they should be trusted in the future to resolve this,\u201d North said. \u201cAnd they probably need to show empathy for the fact that this isn\u2019t just a phone.
