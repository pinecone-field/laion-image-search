How much income you can generate depends on several factors, including how big your nest egg is, how it\u2019s invested, where interest rates go and your risk tolerance. A lot goes into creating and managing an income-producing portfolio that works for you. But here are some basics to consider. Three questions to answer Ideally, you want to begin planning three to five years ahead of when you plan to draw income from your portfolio. Start by asking: How do I want to occupy my time when I leave my job? Will you still do paid work, just not put in as many hours? Do you want to travel a lot? Go back to school? Build an eco-friendly home? Whatever your choices, the more specific you can be, the easier it will be to assess your actual income needs when the time comes, said certified financial planner David Seufer, founder of Gravitas Wealth Planning. What fixed sources of income will I have? That is, steady payments that won\u2019t fluctuate. Social Security benefits are the most typical example. (You can get an estimate specific to your earnings history here.) If you\u2019ll get a pension, count that too. How much will I spend? Knowing your expenses will give you a good sense of the income you\u2019ll need. Marguerita Cheng, a certified financial planner and founder of Blue Ocean Global Wealth, asks her clients to write down what they consider to be their \u201ccore and essential\u201d expenses \u2014 she doesn\u2019t call them \u201cfixed,\u201d because some are not, like your energy bill, which can be seasonal. She also asks them to write about their \u201cvariable or lifestyle\u201d expenses, which reflect what you do regularly that is important to you. If there are new expenses you will incur based on your plans, add those in. Or if you plan to move, account for how your living expenses may change. Ways to generate income Take the income you think you\u2019ll need and subtract from that the income you expect. For example, if you need $65,000 a year but will only bring in $40,000, you\u2019ll need to generate the other $25,000. There are several ways savings and investments can do that, or at least cover part of that shortfall. Among the most common is interest from high-yield savings accounts, money market accounts, certificates of deposit, Treasury bills and government and corporate bonds. Dividend are another income source. But you don\u2019t just want dividend-paying equities in your portfolio. \u201cWhen one invests only in stocks that pay dividends or that only pay the highest dividends, one may miss out on the capital appreciation potential of stocks that pay no dividend at all or much lower dividend rates,\u201d said David Edmisten, a certified financial planner and founder of Next Phase Financial Planning. Instead, Edmisten recommends having both growth stocks and dividend-paying stocks. That way, he said \u201c[you] collect dividends for income, but also generate capital appreciation to help combat inflation.\u201d Capital gains, which result from selling an asset for more than you bought it, are another income source. Keep in mind you don\u2019t need to buy individual stocks and bonds. You can get exposure to both through low-cost mutual funds and exchange-traded funds. Setting up an income-producing portfolio You want to have enough cash to support you in the near term \u2014 and to protect you from having to sell assets at a loss in market downturns. But you also need long-term growth in your portfolio because, even when you retire, you may live for 25 or more years. Edmisten recommends using a bucket strategy: \u2022 Keep 18 to 24 months of expenses in cash or cash-equivalents, which include high-yield savings accounts, short-term CDs and Treasury bills. \u2022 For money you\u2019ll need in three to five years, use short-term corporate bonds as well as longer-term CDs. \u2022 For years six through 10, have a mix of stocks and longer-term bonds. \u2022 And for years 11 and up, your money should just be in stocks. Replenishing your cash reserve If your cash reserves are running down faster than you expect, you can replenish them in several ways. You can stop reinvesting some of your dividends and instead take the cash payout. You can take some capital gains off the table and rebalance your portfolio, Cheng said. Say your plan allocates 20% of your portfolio to a given asset class (e.g., large-cap growth stocks) and it grows to 25%. You can sell shares equal to that 5% difference and put the money into your cash accounts. Or, if you don\u2019t have a lot of gains, you might liquidate some of your bonds in your three-to-five-year bucket so you don\u2019t have to sell long-term growth assets, Edmisten said. Another option: If you or your spouse are still working and maxing out contributions to a workplace retirement savings plan or IRA, you might temporarily reduce them. To reduce your cash needs, you also might look to see what expenses you can trim. The biggest costs for many people are housing, transportation and health care, Cheng said. Diversify and mind the tax consequences Having a diversified income stream gives you flexibility to pull from one type of investment over another when it\u2019s most advantageous to do so. Beyond dividend-paying stocks, bonds and interest-bearing instruments, some people  may want annuities to be part of their income stream. You can purchase them in exchange for the guarantee of a steady paycheck over a given number of years. \u201cAnnuities can make sense in certain situations \u2014 with clients who are a little risk averse \u2026 especially if they don\u2019t have a pension or other sources of guaranteed income,\u201d Seufer said. But annuities are complex. They can be expensive and give you less flexibility to make changes if your life changes. So be informed. \u201cUnderstand the contract. And understand what the limitations are,\u201d Edmisten said. You also will want some flexibility to time which accounts to draw from, based on their tax consequences, Seufer said. For example, a pre-tax 401(k), a taxable brokerage account and tax-free money in a Roth IRA offer a good mix of options. Similarly, some investments generate tax-free income at the federal or state level, such as Treasury bills and municipal bonds. Get help with what you need You may feel fine managing everything on your own. If not, you may want to pay a flat fee to a fee-only certified financial planner to provide a roadmap for how to set things up and to offer periodic guidance throughout the year. Or you may be interested in letting a CFP not only come up with a plan but directly manage your investments, too, if they\u2019re qualified. Tell the planner what you want. It could be guidance on cash flow management, taxes or optimizing when you and your spouse should take Social Security. \u201cIt\u2019s okay to be direct about where you think you need help,\u201d Cheng said. And if you do decide to let a firm manage your nest egg, ideally you don\u2019t want to pay more than 1% of your assets a year for that service, she suggested.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/success/income-producing-portfolio-passive-income/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2022_04_27_business_diamonds-manmade-demand", "text": "It\u2019s proposal season, and engagements are on the rise. So are factory-made diamond sales. Not that you\u2019d know the difference. Man-made diamonds look the same as naturally occurring ones. The only noticeable difference is the price tag. \u201cThe result is really stunning,\u201d said Edahn Golan, an independent diamond industry analyst. He said March data showed the number of engagement rings sold that featured a manufactured diamond jumped 63% compared to last year, while the number of engagement rings sold with a natural diamond declined 25% in the same period. Going back by another month, to February, the data showed the number of rings sold with lab diamonds that month surged even more, to 80% compared to a year earlier while the number fell by 13% for natural diamond engagement rings.  \u201cThe big fear in the natural diamonds industry is that consumers will start accepting lab-grown diamonds in engagement rings,\u201d he said. Too late. \u201cIt\u2019s actually happening.\u201d  Tide is shifting Why are consumers flocking to man-made diamonds? Cost is the most obvious reason. The average retail price of the most popular one carat round man-made diamond for an engagement ring in March was $2,318, Golan said. \u201cThis is substantially less \u2013 as much as 73% cheaper \u2013 than a natural diamond of the same size, cut and clarity as the man-made diamond, which would cost $8,740,\u201d he said. Plus, the lower cost allows couples to buy a bigger stone.  \u201cA lab diamond is a real diamond, but maybe it took a few weeks to make it,\u201d said Golan. \u201cNatural diamonds were formed over 800 million to three billion years and there isn\u2019t an infinite supply of them.\u201d  This makes natural diamonds quite a bit more expensive, and prices are likely to rise as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has tightened the supply chain for natural raw diamonds. The sanctions directly target Alrosa, partly owned by the Russian government, which the US government identified as the world\u2019s largest diamond mining company, accounting for 28% of global diamond output. Man-made diamonds are also becoming popular as consumers are more aware and educated about them, said Dan Moran, a third-generation diamond expert and owner of LA-based fine jeweler Concierge Diamonds. Moran said the typical buyer of man-made diamonds is typically younger than 40 and very budget conscious. Mined diamonds have a controversial history that\u2019s tied to the use of child labor in some African diamond mines as well as sales of illegally-traded \u201cconflict diamonds\u201d that fund conflict in war-torn areas. Among Millennials and Gen Z, their eco-conscious mindset and ethical concerns about natural diamond sourcing is another factor influencing their preference for non-traditional engagement rings, according to a report from wedding planning website The Knot. Small but growing share of the diamond market Although its slice is growing, the market share for man-made diamonds remains relatively small. Currently, about 7% of the specialty diamond jewelry market is represented by man-made diamonds, up from 3% in 2020, said Golan.  Some major jewelry retailers are driving the effort to take man-made diamonds mainstream. In 2021, the world\u2019s largest jewelry company, Pandora\n            \n                (PANDY), made a major shift by announcing it would stop using mined diamonds and would swap to lab-created diamonds in its jewelry.  Pandora said it\u2019s instituting the change as part of an effort to sell sustainable jewelry, and also because consumers increasingly are asking for it. Signet,\n            \n                (SIG) the largest jewelry company in the United States (which owns Zales, Kay Jewelers and Jared chains) called out the popularity of lab diamond jewelry in its March earnings call with analysts. Calling it a \u201cfast-growing category\u201d in its jewelry portfolio, Signet CEO Virginia Drosos told analysts that lab-created diamonds are among the big jewelry trends she expects this year.  The company said it has expanded its man-made bridal jewelry selection in both its Zales and Kay Jewelers stores in response to the increased demand.  Fine jewelry brand Charles and Colvard, which makes lab-created diamonds, said consumers don\u2019t just want to look good with the jewelry they are wearing, they also want to feel good about it. \u201cAs the momentum for conscious consumerism grows, the surge towards lab grown diamonds isn\u2019t surprising,\u201d said Don O\u2019Connell, president and CEO of Charles & Colvard. \u201c[Consumers] want to know the origins of their stones and be reassured they\u2019re conflict-free. They\u2019re embracing the choice to purchase a piece of fine jewelry that aligns with their values.\u201d Lab-grown diamond brand VRAI said the pandemic, too, has sparked attention and action toward social and environmental issues. It said consumers are being more thoughtful and reassessing their purchasing habits, as well as the companies and industries they are supporting. There is, however, one important consideration for anyone buying lab-created diamonds: Man-made diamonds have little resale value.  So while you may not be able to tell a natural diamond from a factory made variety, someone with a trained eye can, said Golan. Once a stone is identified as a factory diamond, even though you paid a lot less for it, you also won\u2019t get much for it.  But the value of a ring isn\u2019t just monetary. \u201cAs a professional in the industry, I am asked all the time by people about what I think about a ring they have,\u201d said Moran, of Concierge Jewelers. \u201cI always say, if you love it, be happy with it. An engagement ring is a symbol of commitment and enduring love.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/27/business/diamonds-manmade-demand/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "business"}}

You can sign up\u00a0right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link. Wall Street\u2019s artificial intelligence enthusiasts are expanding their horizons. The S&P 500\u2019s utility sector has gained 14% this year, making it the third-best-performing category behind information technology and communication services. The sector is also outpacing the benchmark index\u2019s 11% climb. Shares of Vistra have surged 152% this year, Constellation Energy shares have popped 91% and NRG Energy shares have gained 63%. That\u2019s a reversal from the sector\u2019s dour returns last year. Utility stocks tumbled more than 10% in 2023, underperforming the S&P 500\u2019s 24% gain, as investors betting on the artificial intelligence boom crowded into the Magnificent Seven big tech stocks. Wall Street also turned away from dividend-paying stocks, many of which are utilities, as high interest rates made bond yields the most attractive they have looked in years. This year, the playbook has changed. Big tech\u2019s market leadership has cracked. At the same time, investors are looking for cheaper alternatives to the Magnificent Seven, whose valuations reached lofty levels after last year\u2019s tech-driven monster stock rally. Enter utilities. These stocks are typically viewed as defensive plays, since people tend to prioritize paying for necessities like electricity over discretionary purchases when the economy is in rough shape. But investors are wagering this year that utilities companies will be key in building and running the infrastructure needed to service AI. The utilities sector currently trades at roughly 17 times its expected earnings over the next 12 months, below the S&P 500\u2019s multiple of about 21 and information technology\u2019s approximately 28 multiple. \u201cInvestors are now playing offense with utilities,\u201d wrote Bespoke Investment Group researchers in a Monday note. \u201cIt takes a lot of power to run AI, and coupled with demand for (electric vehicles) and modern day heating and cooling needs, our current grid seems woefully inadequate.\u201d A Google search requires 0.3 watt-hours of electricity on average, while a ChatGPT request typically consumes about 2.9 watt-hours, according to the International Energy Agency. Factoring in that there are about 9 billion searches a day, nearly 10 terawatt-hours of additional electricity a year would be required if search engines fully implement AI. The agency predicts AI-related electricity demand will increase at least tenfold by 2026. Plus, utility stocks\u2019 defensive qualities have been attractive to investors who fear that the Federal Reserve will keep rates on hold after a spate of warm inflation data. While the April Consumer Price Index showed that prices cooled last month, investors expect the Fed will begin cutting rates in September at the earliest. To be sure, not everyone is jumping into utility stocks. Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist at LPL Financial, said that the company remains neutral on the sector despite recognizing it could have more upside. \u201cThe growth trajectory of a utility company is not comparable to these poster children of AI\u201d such as Nvidia and Super Micro Computer, wrote Turnquist in a May 9 note. US inflation slowed in April, providing a glimmer of hope for weary Americans After a hot start to 2024, inflation cooled back down in April, providing a bit of hope for Americans worn down by elevated prices, reports my colleague Alicia Wallace. Consumer prices were up 3.4% for the 12 months ended in April, easing from 3.5% the month before, according to the latest Consumer Price Index report released Wednesday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. On a monthly basis, prices rose 0.3%, a slower pace of growth than the 0.4% seen in the two months prior. Economists were expecting a 0.4% monthly increase and an annual gain of 3.4%, according to FactSet consensus estimates. Rising gasoline and shelter costs accounted for more than 70% of the monthly increase in overall inflation, according to the report. While elevated housing costs and high prices at the pump continue to weigh on Americans, Wednesday\u2019s report did provide some welcome news on another staple spending area: Grocery prices fell for the first time in a year, dropping 0.2% from March. A closely watched underlying measurement of inflation showed even more progress. Core CPI, which strips out the more volatile categories of energy and food, slowed from 3.8% to 3.6%, its lowest rate since April 2021. From the month before, core CPI ticked up by 0.3%, its slowest pace since the end of last year. Read more here. Taylor Swift\u2019s \u2018Eras Tour\u2019 could be worth almost $1 billion to British economy Taylor Swift\u2019s smash-hit \u201cEras Tour\u201d is set to boost spending in the United Kingdom by nearly $1 billion, according to estimates by Barclays. The British bank said in a report Wednesday that it expects nearly 1.2 million Swifties to attend the superstar\u2019s shows in the UK this summer, with the typical fan expected to spend \u00a3642 ($810) on travel, accommodation and other expenses \u2014 injecting a total of \u00a3755 million ($953 million) into the economy. It is just the latest example of \u201cSwiftonomics\u201d \u2014 the musician\u2019s ability to influence the economies of the cities and countries that she visits on her mammoth global tour, which kicked off in March last year in the United States, reports my colleague Anna Cooban. Fans are likely to fork out \u00a3121 ($153) for accommodation, \u00a3111 ($140) for travel and \u00a359 ($74) in restaurants around the venues, according to Barclays, which based its estimates on customer transaction data and proprietary consumer research. Swift will perform 15 shows across four UK cities in England, Wales and Scotland in June and August. The concerts sold out within minutes of tickets going on sale, with fans spending \u00a3206 ($260) on average on a single ticket, Barclays said. Including the ticket price, UK concertgoers will spend, on average, \u00a3848 ($1,068) each, which is more than 12 times the average cost of a night out in the UK, according to Barclays\u2019 research.

{"id": "2024_05_18_business_price-gouging-explained", "text": "Emily Miller lucked out. Of the millions of fans \u2014 and bots \u2014 flooding Ticketmaster\u2019s site in hopes of purchasing tickets to Taylor Swift\u2019s Eras Tour, the 22-year-old managed to score $200 floor seats to see the mega pop star perform in Pittsburgh last summer. Now, Miller dreams of seeing Swift perform again when her tour returns to the US later this year. But despite entering 10 accounts to get a code that would give her the chance to buy tickets at face value through Ticketmaster\u2019s presale, she was unsuccessful. On the resale market, nosebleed-seat tickets behind the stage are already listed for thousands of dollars. \u201cPeople are taking advantage of fans and their vulnerability because people like me who have been fans of Taylor for so, so long would do genuinely anything just to be inside that stadium,\u201d Miller, who is currently in an accelerated nursing degree program in Cleveland, told CNN. The resellers are price gouging the fans, she said. The term has been used a lot lately to describe so much more than just hiking gasoline prices during a hurricane. At the core of the increasingly common accusation of price gouging is the sense that the consumer is being exploited. But it\u2019s not as cut and dry as you may think. In fact, economists \u2014 and even President Joe Biden \u2014 can\u2019t agree on a definition of it. But there\u2019s one thing everyone agrees on: Just about everything costs more than it used to a few years ago, a consequence of inflation. Although the pace of price increases has cooled substantially, we\u2019re still paying more. It doesn\u2019t help that prices can rise in seconds thanks to technology, unlike times when hikes would require, for instance, printing new menus. Consumers are taking to social media more to draw attention to times they feel like they are being ripped off. When, in effect, they may more likely be victims of inflation \u2014 or good old supply and demand. Price gouging is in the eye of the bidder Gavin Roberts, chair of Weber State University\u2019s economics department and who studies the effect of anti-price gouging laws, said the laws themselves often don\u2019t define what price gouging is. Biden has been quite vocal about cracking down on price gouging, which he uses interchangeably with \u201ccorporate greed,\u201d both of which he claims are a contributing factor to inflation. At the same time, Biden hasn\u2019t defined what price gouging is and what it isn\u2019t. Biden takes particular issue with instances where the cost of producing a good has gone down while the price consumers pay goes up, a White House official told CNN. But he doesn\u2019t believe that price gouging is driving inflation or that all corporations are price gouging consumers. Corporations charging as much as they can, as painful as it may be for consumers, doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re necessarily price gouging, said Roberts. In Roberts\u2019 view, price gouging occurs when there\u2019s a scarcity of a good or service, lack of competition and the consumer has very little information about the price they\u2019ll be charged or doesn\u2019t have the ability to shop around for better prices. All that could lead them to be taken advantage of. The best example of this, he said, would be someone going to the emergency room in dire need of care and months later receiving a bill for thousands of dollars. It wouldn\u2019t, in his view, be price gouging if a situation arose during which someone had the only attainable bottle of water and auctioned it off to a crowd of people for the highest possible price. That\u2019s because people had upfront information about how the price was set, he said. Steven Suranovic, an economics professor at George Washington University who has also published research on price gouging, sees it differently. \u201cI define it as the use of market power to secure a higher price than what would occur with free competition,\u201d he said. \u201cFor example, Martin Shkreli was a price gouger when he set ridiculously high prices on some pharmaceutical drugs his company controlled.\u201d When Shkreli was CEO of the company formerly known as Turing Pharmaceuticals, the price of the lifesaving drug Daraprim used by AIDS patients was raised from $13.50 a pill to $750 a pill, in 2015, sparking a public outcry. CNN reached out to Shkreli, who was later convicted of securities fraud and conspiracy, over LinkedIn. Shkreli responded to CNN in a message on LinkedIn: \u201cwe dont talk to snitches.\u201d Price gouging or dynamic pricing? Waiting to order an Uber until you make your way to the lobby of a building could cost you 20% more than the price you saw when you first opened the app. That\u2019s the essence of the Uber business model, a practice known as dynamic pricing where there is no fixed rate for how much your ride will cost. Rather, it is tied to the supply of drivers in a given area and the demand for rides. Uber, like its main competitor Lyft, has come under scrutiny for allowing prices to surge at times when public transit is severely disrupted. In some instances, the companies suspended surge pricing temporarily. (Neither company responded to requests for comment.) Surge pricing was in full effect, though, on New Year\u2019s Eve of 2011 when Uber experienced what was then its highest demand in New York City, causing rides to spike above $100. That invited a slew of price gouging accusations. Travis Kalanick, the CEO at the time, later penned a blog post noting, \u201cNobody is required to take an Uber, but having a reliable option is what we\u2019re shooting for. It\u2019s not about gouging.\u201d Suranovic said surge pricing can simply be a product of \u201ca competitive market.\u201d But he acknowledged that sudden price increases are more likely to lead consumers to believe they\u2019re being price gouged and \u201cblame business for profiteering.\u201d \u201cHigher costs due to inflation is a cause of gradual price increases, but I wouldn\u2019t consider that gouging,\u201d he told CNN. Consumer protections Experts in pricing strategy warn that surprise increases can generate a backlash. \u201cPrice gouging is a subjective emotion of a consumer feeling that they are being taken advantage of by an unfairly high price,\u201d said Rafi Mohammed, who founded a pricing strategy consultancy firm called Culture of Profit. \u201cWhen setting a price, managers need to understand and anticipate that their prices will elicit emotional reactions ranging from \u2018that\u2019s cheap\u2019 to \u2018this is unfair.\u2019\u201d To avoid that, his philosophy has been to set prices in a manner that could elicit a response from customers along the lines of \u201cThank you! I looked around at various offerings and determined that your product and price offered me the best value.\u201d That said, if you do believe you\u2019re being price gouged, your state may be able to step in \u2014 as many did during the pandemic, even for goods like toilet paper, by capping prices. (Though Roberts\u2019 research suggests some anti-price gouging laws are to blame if you couldn\u2019t find toilet paper.) Still, Teresa Murray, director of the consumer watchdog division of US PIRG, a nonprofit consumer advocacy research group, wrote in a blog post that \u201cif you aren\u2019t sure whether a product is priced too high, it\u2019s better to report problematic items to the company and your attorney general.\u201d Perhaps state attorneys general should consider a special division dedicated to Swifties, too.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/18/business/price-gouging-explained/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_18_business_college-graduations-pro-palestinian-protests", "text": "Universities across the United States have adopted a number of tactics in recent weeks to prevent disruptions by pro-Palestinian protesters at graduation ceremonies. Some universities have reached agreements with on-campus demonstrators, while others have cited safety concerns and canceled, postponed or relocated their schoolwide ceremonies. Several schools continue to grapple with pro-Palestinian protesters ahead of their spring commencement, subjecting themselves to internal scrutiny and public criticism. Protesters arrested at UPenn On Friday night, University of Pennsylvania police arrested 19 individuals, including seven students, following an attempt by pro-Palestinian demonstrators to occupy a university building, a\u00a0university spokesperson told CNN Saturday. Penn Against the Occupation announced their intention to occupy Fisher-Bennet Hall in\u00a0a post on the group\u2019s Instagram\u00a0Friday night, calling for people to \u201cflood UPenn for Palestine.\u201d The group called on the school\u2019s administration, in part, to divest from corporations \u201cthat profit from Israel\u2019s war on Gaza and occupation in Palestine and academically from Israel institutions, condemning the scholasticide of Palestinian scholars and universities,\u201d according to another Instagram post. Friday\u2019s arrests follow\u00a0the arrest of at least 33 people\u00a0on May 10 when law enforcement broke down a pro-Palestinian encampment erected on campus. The latest campus arrests also come just a few days before Monday\u2019s universitywide commencement ceremony, where students and their families will be subject to additional safety procedures\u00a0described as\u00a0\u201cairport-style security screening,\u201d the university said in a safety update earlier this month. Guests and graduates\u00a0will not be allowed\u00a0to bring signs, posters, flags and artificial noisemakers, according to school officials. UCLA and Sonoma State face internal division On Thursday, the Academic Senate at the University of California, Los Angeles rejected resolutions of no confidence and censure brought against Gene Block, the school\u2019s chancellor. The resolutions were brought forward in the\u00a0wake of an attack by counterprotesters\u00a0on an on-campus pro-Palestinian encampment on April 30, and claimed Block \u201cfailed to ensure the safety of our students and grievously mishandled\u201d the situation. The no-confidence resolution failed after only 43% of members voted in its favor. The resolution to censure failed to get the majority of votes required to pass by the senate. In all, 88 members voted in favor of the censure, while 88 opposed it, three abstained and 15 were present but didn\u2019t vote. \u201cIt is clear that we are not united in how we view the major events of the past weeks and the campus response to them,\u201d Chair Andrea M. Kasko said Friday in a statement. \u201cI hope that we can try to find common ground as colleagues, and have the courage to listen with open minds and open hearts even when we do not agree.\u201d Also Friday, Mildred Garc\u00eda, the chancellor of the California State University System, announced Sonoma State University President Mike Lee would be stepping down after he sent a message \u201cconcerning an agreement with campus protesters \u2026 sent without the appropriate approvals.\u201d The statement sent by Lee to the Sonoma State campus community on Tuesday included agreements to set up an advisory council of Students for Justice in Palestine as well as a review of the university\u2019s vendor contracts and investments, according to a copy of the message obtained by CNN. \u201cSSU will not pursue or engage in any study abroad programs, faculty exchanges, or other formal collaborations that are sponsored by, or represent, the Israeli state academic and research institutions,\u201d Lee wrote, adding study abroad programs in Israel will be \u201cterminated until further notice.\u201d On Wednesday, Garc\u00eda announced Lee had been placed on administrative leave for \u201cinsubordination.\u201d Morehouse threatens to shut down ceremony \u2018on the spot\u2019 In Atlanta, Morehouse College President David A. Thomas said he would shut down Sunday\u2019s commencement ceremonies \u201con the spot\u201d rather than allow police to remove student protesters during President Joe Biden\u2019s highly anticipated graduation speech. \u201cWhat we won\u2019t allow is disruptive behavior that prevents the ceremony or services from proceeding in a manner that those in attendance can partake and enjoy,\u201d Thomas told CNN\u2019s Victor Blackwell in an interview Thursday. \u201cSo, for example, prolonged shouting down of the president as he speaks. I have also made a decision that we will also not ask police to take individuals out of commencement in zip ties. If faced with the choice, I will cease the ceremonies on the spot If we were to reach that position.\u201d Biden\u2019s presence at Morehouse, one of the nation\u2019s preeminent historically Black colleges, comes as the president campaigns amid weak polling among young voters, even as many have expressed frustration with his administration\u2019s continued support of Israel\u2019s military campaign in Gaza. Biden has been\u00a0confronted by some protests\u00a0during his own speeches and campaign events. On January 23, his campaign speech on abortion rights at George Mason University in Virginia was interrupted\u00a0more than a dozen\u00a0times over his administration\u2019s support of Israel.

{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit", "text": "When Apple launched its first Mac computer in 1984, with its iconic Mac smiley-face \u201chello\u201d greeting, it wanted to differentiate itself in the fledgling PC market. The Mac was approachable with its friendly, innovative design \u2013 Apple\u2019s way of setting the Mac apart in the confusing PC landscape. That consumer-friendly mantra still exists today, with Apple carefully curating an easy-breezy yet controlled user experience across its products, including the billions of iPhones used around the world. But the Biden administration believes Apple took that too far. On Thursday, the Department of Justice sued Apple for illegally monopolizing the smartphone market. In a press conference, the government provided a long list of how Apple has allegedly squashed competition with restrictive app store terms, high fees and its \u201cwalled-garden\u201d approach, restricting how third-party companies interact with its brands and services. The company denied the lawsuit\u2019s allegations and said it plans to fight them. Apple added that the lawsuit could empower the government \u201cto take a heavy hand in designing people\u2019s technology.\u201d But if successful, the lawsuit could ripple across Apple\u2019s products and services. Although the suit could take years to play out, here\u2019s a closer look what it may eventually mean for iPhone users: Changes to the App Store If found liable, the company could be forced to change a number of things. One such change is how iPhone users could get greater access to \u201csuper apps\u201d that have been largely restricted before. The term refers to one-stop-shop apps that allow for messaging, ordering food, payment processing and other capabilities all within one platform.  According to Dipanjan Chatterjee, a principal analyst at market research firm Forrester, super apps most threaten Apple\u2019s preeminence in the lives of its customers. \u201cAn offering like WeChat, dubbed China\u2019s everything app, can provide an alternative to the Apple ecosystem for people to communicate, bank, share memories, talk to businesses and more,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cWhat Apple fears most is becoming irrelevant to its customers.\u201d At the same time, super apps like WeChat are created by larger companies and could, therefore, put some smaller companies at a disadvantage. And the concept hasn\u2019t been welcomed much in the US anyway. The US government, however, could argue that lack of interest may be due to Apple\u2019s high share of the smartphone market and its resistance to offer super apps in its store, Chatterjee said. Better interoperability Apple may also be required to offer more support for cross-platform messaging, an issue the company previously said it\u2019s already working on. The company lets iPhone users send high-quality photos and videos to one another, but similar texts to Android phones are slower and grainy. It also maintains those messages in green bubbles, creating a kind of class divide, critics argue. In November, the company said it will add new features, such as read receipts, typing indicators, better support for group chats and higher quality media sharing of images and videos, across platforms to help close the gap. Apple\u2019s move to add support for the standard called RCS (rich communication services) is intended to roll out later this year. RCS is considered the replacement to alternatives such as SMS, or short messaging service, and can work over both Wi-Fi and mobile data. The change followed pressure from both regulators and competitors to more seamlessly work across operating systems. The European Union\u2019s Digital Markets Act, for example, requires companies to make their key services interoperable between platforms. The US government could require the same. More open services Another likely change is how hardware from other companies, such as smartwatches, will interact with the Apple range of devices and software, including the iPhone and Apple\u2019s services like Fitness+. The company has also required Apple Watch users to own iOS devices as a way to keep them locked into its existing ecosystem. Chatterjee said making this change would have both positives and negatives. \u201cThe net result would reside somewhere along the spectrum of access to more and cheaper options but also the devaluation of the customer experience that is so highly prized by Apple\u2019s customers,\u201d he said. The Biden administration has also taken issue with Apple\u2019s lack of support for mobile cloud services. Loosening this could allow users to access games and other cloud-based apps without having to pay for pricey hardware. Inside the debate The DOJ lawsuit claims Apple\u2019s behavior has illegally hindered competition, kept its customers locked into its products and prevented other companies from innovating. Although the Biden administration will have to prove these harms, some critics say any potential changes Apple could make will negatively impact the user experience. David McQueen, a research director at ABI Research, said he recognizes that the content and applications market should be open, and Apple needs to avoid monopolistic advantages that can restrict competition, push up prices or block innovation. But Apple\u2019s success stems in part to its tight grip on its products and services, keeping things intuitive and seamless. \u201cIf Apple is forced to comply, it could potentially spell the end to the provision of this consistent and unified user experience, although by the same token, consumers will be open to a greater choice of apps and services, helping more developers and providers,\u201d McQueen said. Chatterjee noted some people are drawn to the Apple family of products precisely because of the carefully managed ecosystem\u2019s ease of use. Apple may have to work that much harder to preserve the integrity of its experience, but any changes probably won\u2019t be enough to make customers to leave and go elsewhere. \u201cThe vast majority of Apple customers would probably be happier with some more choice and lower prices as long as it did not hamper their levels of customer experience, which is threatened by the less control Apple has over the experience,\u201d Chatterjee said. But he added those currently outside of the Apple ecosystem will likely benefit by \u201cplugging in opportunistically without having to go all in with Apple.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_22_media_ronna-mcdaniel-nbc", "text": "NBC News on Friday announced that it had hired Ronna McDaniel, the former Republican National Committee chair who has repeatedly\u00a0attacked the network and its journalists,\u00a0assailed the\u00a0news\u00a0media as \u201cfake news\u201d and promoted false claims around the 2020\u00a0vote,\u00a0as an on-air commentator\u00a0ahead of the 2024 presidential election. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be a more important moment to have a voice like Ronna\u2019s on the team,\u201d Carrie Budoff Brown, senior vice president of politics at NBC News, said in a memo\u00a0to staff. McDaniel exited the RNC earlier this month after leading the organization since 2016. During her time as chair, McDaniel repeatedly attacked the press, which has become increasingly popular in Republican circles over the last several years as Donald Trump demonizes journalists and news institutions. McDaniel echoed many such attacks, labeling the press as \u201cfake news\u201d and calling the media \u201ccorrupt.\u201d At times, she even targeted NBC News\u00a0and MSNBC\u00a0with dishonest attacks. In 2019, for instance, McDaniel accused Richard Engel, NBC News\u2019 chief foreign correspondent, of \u201cactively cheering for an economic downturn.\u201d \u201cHow can NBC let him keep his job when he\u2019s made his bias so clear?\u201d McDaniel asked. McDaniel has a lengthier history attacking the progressive cable news channel MSNBC, which she will appear on in her new role. In recent years, she has repeatedly attacked the channel for \u201cspreading lies\u201d and blasted those she described as the network\u2019s \u201cprimetime propagandists.\u201d An NBC spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment about her attacks on the news media and NBC. In her role as RNC chief, McDaniel also fanned the flames of election denialism after the 2020 presidential contest. McDaniel was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d The Michigan Department of State\u2019s office condemned her claims of supposed voter fraud in the wake of the election, stating they had \u201cno merit.\u201d\u00a0The state\u2019s \u201celections were conducted fairly, effectively and transparently and are an accurate reflection of the will of Michigan voters,\u201d it said in a\u00a0detailed fact check\u00a0posted online. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Chris Wallace last year, McDaniel defended her claims of voting \u201cirregularity\u201d in the election. \u201cI think saying that there were problems with 2020 is very real. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s election denying,\u201d McDaniel told Wallace. \u201cI\u2019m from Wayne County. We had a woman send a note saying I\u2019m being told to backdate ballots. We had to look into that. That\u2019s deeply concerning. When you have friends who are poll-watching and being kicked out, that\u2019s deeply concerning. We have every right to look at that.\u201d In the interview,\u00a0Wallace pressed McDaniel if she believed Biden legitimately won the election. \u201cI think there were lots of problems with 2020. Ultimately, he won the election\u00a0but there were lots of problems with the 2020 election,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think he won it fair. I don\u2019t. I\u2019m not going to say that.\u201d NBC\u2019s hiring of McDaniel, however, plays into a recent trend at the\u00a0network\u2019s outlets, which has seemingly softened its stance on Trump as he inches toward the Republican nomination for president. Earlier this month, CNBC hosted Trump for a lengthy phone interview in which the network\u2019s anchors allowed him to peddle lies and conspiracy theories on air\u00a0without scrutiny. MSNBC has even started carrying Trump\u2019s remarks live on television, a practice that the network boasted for years it would not do. Star host Rachel Maddow, who has said carrying Trump\u2019s lies\u00a0on the air\u00a0is dangerous, even objected to the network broadcasting a recent speech from the presumptive Republican nominee, calling it \u201cirresponsible.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/22/media/ronna-mcdaniel-nbc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "business"}}

Ibrahim Al-Omar, director general of Saudia Group, the state-controlled owner of the Saudia airline and low-cost carrier Flyadeal, said Monday that the first planes would be delivered in the first quarter of 2026. \u201cThe Saudia Group announces today the largest deal in the history of Saudi aviation,\u201d he said in a speech at the Future Aviation Forum in Riyadh, referring to the contract with Airbus. Saudia Group\u2019s current fleet comprises\u00a093 Airbus and 51 Boeing aircraft, according to its website. And the latest deal adds to the group\u2019s existing backlog of Airbus orders of 39 aircraft, the European airplane maker said in a statement. Al-Omar did not specify whether it was the number of airplanes ordered or the total value of the order that made it Saudi Arabia\u2019s biggest-ever aviation deal. When asked by CNN about that, as well as the value of the deal, Saudia Group did not respond, while Airbus declined to comment. But, in a press release, the organizers of the Future Aviation Forum said the new order totaled $19 billion. In a separate statement, Al-Omar said the new order would help realize Saudi Arabia\u2019s Vision 2030, a program aimed at diversifying the country\u2019s economy away from oil. A key part of the program is making the kingdom an attractive destination for tourists. \u201cSaudia has ambitious operational objectives to meet growing demand,\u201d Al-Omar said. \u201cWe are increasing flights and seat capacity across our existing 100-plus destinations on four continents, with plans for further expansion.\u201d The country hopes to attract 150 million tourists per year by 2030, according to its National Tourism Strategy. Another win for Boeing\u2019s rival News of the Saudi deal comes as Airbus\u2019s main rival Boeing (BA) faces intense scrutiny over a series of safety failures,\u00a0including a mid-air blowout of part of a fuselage in January. The incident has prompted a number of investigations into Boeing\u2019s practices, an executive shake-up and promises that the company will turn itself around. But Boeing has been struggling ever since fatal crashes of its 737 Max aircraft in 2018 and 2019 resulted in a 20-month grounding of its best-selling plane. The company was also hit by the pandemic, which brought air travel to a near-standstill for months and caused deep losses at most of the airlines that buy Boeing\u2019s planes. Since the start of the grounding in 2019, the company has reported adjusted losses totaling more than $31 billion. Since the beginning of this year, its stock price has tanked by almost 28%. Despite having a backlog of orders amounting to more 5,600 commercial jets, worth $529 billion, Boeing cannot make planes quickly enough each year to turn a profit as it\u2019s working to address its quality issues. Meanwhile, Airbus, reported an order backlog of almost 8,600 aircraft at the end of 2023 and posted a profit of \u20ac3.8 billion ($4.1 billion) for the year.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/business/saudi-arabia-airline-airbus-biggest-order/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_12_success_equal-pay-day-2024", "text": "March 12 marks Equal Pay Day in the United States, a symbolic date representing the number of days women have to work into the current year just to make the same amount of money men made in the prior one. Put another way, to make 12 months\u2019 worth of a man\u2019s median wages, a woman has to work about 14.5 months. In dollars and cents, for every dollar a man earns, a woman is paid 84 cents, according to the National Committee on Pay Equity and the Equal Pay Today campaign. That\u2019s based on earnings data for full-time, year-round workers from the US Census in 2022, which was the most recent full-year data set available. If part-time workers and those not employed year-round are included, the gender pay gap is worse, at 78 cents on the dollar, said Deborah Vagins, national campaign director of Equal Rights Advocates and director of Equal Pay Today. The size of the actual wage gap between men and women will widen or narrow depending on age, level of education, choice of occupation and tenure, as well as race and ethnicity. The gender pay gap is typically widest when comparing the earnings of White men to Black, Hispanic or Native American women. And, generally speaking, the gap is narrower in a given job when men and women are in their early- to mid-20s (i.e., when they are new to the workforce and before children come along), and also when comparing wages by title, tenure and education level within a given field. But no matter how you slice and dice the data, there are very few scenarios in which women on average earn the same as men. Indeed, in its latest analysis of median weekly earnings last year by occupation, the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research found that women earned less than men not only in all 20 of the largest occupations for men but also in all 20 of the largest occupations for women. Among the largest occupations for women, the most egregious pay gaps were among financial managers (women earned 71% of every dollar a man earns), retail salesperson (72%), education and child care administrators (79%), administrative assistants (80%) and managers (81%). The narrowest gap was among cashiers, where women almost have pay parity (98%) with their male colleagues. Same old (and annoying) story every year While the overall gender pay gap has been narrowing over time \u2014 for example, Equal Pay Day in 2005 was April 19, a full five weeks later than this year\u2019s \u2014 the very fact that \ufeffsuch a gap exists at all in 2024 is a reminder that employers and society still have work to do in recognizing the value of women\u2019s contributions at work. \u201cThe gender wage gap is a national disgrace,\u201d said\u00a0Jamila Taylor, IWPR\u2019s president and CEO, in a statement. \u201cEven in professions typically dominated by women, men earn more for doing the same job. Equal pay for equal work has been the law of the land for more than a half-century, yet\u00a0women still cannot get fair treatment when it comes to employment and earnings. And it\u2019s worse for women of color, who face rampant racial discrimination in the workforce in addition to ongoing pay inequities.\u201d The good news is that there are now multiple efforts that may over time help reduce the problem. They include an increasing number of state-level pay transparency laws and bans on employers asking job candidates for their salary histories, which can help chronically underpaid women gain more of an equal footing when they apply for new jobs. There is also now a ban on federal government agencies asking job candidates\u2019 for their salary history and a proposed rule that would prohibit federal contractors from doing the same, as well as requiring them to post in their job ads the pay for given positions. But Vagins and others in the campaign for equal pay also want to see action at the federal legislative level, supporting two bills: the Salary Transparency Act and the Paycheck Fairness Act, which have been introduced in the US House and Senate multiple times. For instance, the Paycheck Fairness Act would, according to Equal Pay Today, \u201cbar retaliation against workers who voluntarily discuss or disclose their wages; close loopholes that have allowed employers to pay women less than men for the same work \u2026 [and] ensure women can receive the same robust remedies for sex-based pay discrimination that are currently available to those subjected to discrimination based on race and ethnicity.\u201d Absent such federal laws requiring all employers to make equal pay more of an imperative, Vagins said, achieving true pay parity for women will be slow in coming.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/12/success/equal-pay-day-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_media_caitlin-clark-wnba-season-debut-ratings", "text": "The Caitlin Clark era in the WNBA kicked off in a big way Tuesday night. The season opener between the Indiana Fever and Connecticut Sun drew an average of 2.1 million viewers on ESPN2, ESPN+ and Disney+, making it the most watched WNBA game in more than two decades. The matchup also marked the first time Disney+ has streamed a live sports game, peaking with an average of 2.3 million viewers, ESPN said. The game, which saw the Sun outshine the Fever in a 92-71 victory, drew the largest WNBA audience since the Los Angeles Sparks and Houston Comets faced off in 2001, according to Sports Illustrated.

{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_judges-stern-rebuke-of-elon-musks-x-gives-researchers-fresh-hope", "text": "A federal judge\u2019s decision this week reprimanding Elon Musk\u2019s X will have reverberating effects on efforts to hold influential online platforms accountable, legal experts and advocacy groups say. On Monday, District Judge Charles Breyer dismissed and excoriated a lawsuit by X against online watchdog group Center for Countering Digital Hate as an attempt to silence the non-profit group for sounding alarms about hate speech on the platform. Breyer wrote in Monday\u2019s order that the lawsuit was \u201cunabashedly\u201d about \u201cpunishing\u201d reports written by CCDH, which X had accused of campaigning to drive away its advertisers. Breyer held that the reports were \u201cunquestionably\u201d protected by the group\u2019s free speech rights. Now, that decision could embolden other research groups and Musk critics who have faced legal threats from the billionaire. The CCDH case \u2014 in the US District Court for the Northern District of California \u2014\u00a0has been widely viewed as a bellwether for research and accountability on X, where Musk has restored the accounts of previously banned White supremacists and spreaders of misinformation and where Musk himself has amplified various conspiracy theories. And CCDH is not the only organization that has faced attacks by self-proclaimed \u201cfree speech absolutist\u201d Musk after criticizing or raising concerns about his platform. \u201cThis is an important decision that sees Elon Musk\u2019s lawsuit for what it is \u2014 an effort to punish his critics for constitutionally protected speech and to deter researchers from studying his platform,\u201d said Alex Abdo, litigation director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, which had filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the case arguing that private companies should not be allowed to use breach of contract claims to punish criticism. \u201cSociety needs reliable and ethical research into social media platforms, and often that research relies on being able to study publicly available posts,\u201d Abdo said. X said it plans to appeal Breyer\u2019s decision. Musk\u2019s threats against X critics In his first year as owner of X, formerly known as Twitter, Musk threatened legal action against the Anti-Defamation League for defamation, as well as against Microsoft and Meta for allegedly improper data and trade secret access, respectively. None of those threats ever amounted to real lawsuits. He did, however, sue the progressive media watchdog Media Matters over its\u00a0analysis\u00a0highlighting antisemitic and pro-Nazi content on X, alleging that the group\u2019s testing methodology was not representative of how real users experience the site and that the report was designed to drive away advertisers. Legal experts have described that case as \u201cweak\u201d on the merits and as a \u201cbogus\u201d attempt to chill criticism of X. This week\u2019s court decision may be only a temporary setback in Musk\u2019s wider plan to stifle criticism, said Media Matters CEO Angelo Carusone. Musk\u2019s new playbook, Carusone said, enlists the help of sympathetic Republican attorneys general to investigate independent reporting organizations and tie them up in legal proceedings. The states of Texas and Missouri each announced probes into Media Matters following X\u2019s lawsuit against the group, to which Musk responded, \u201cGreat!\u201d As recently as Monday, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey filed a petition in state court seeking to compel Media Matters\u2019 cooperation with his investigation. The filing came a week after he appeared with Musk in a live event on X \u2014 which Carusone said shows how Musk hopes to deputize the power of government to silence his critics. \u201cThey have every reason to do it,\u201d Carusone said of the AGs\u2019 investigations. \u201cThey get the political benefits, they get the attention. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any cost to them yet. And if they are successful at developing this new playbook, this new terrain, legally, then it\u2019s going to pave the way for them to just use this tool and tactic over and over and over again.\u201d A representative for X did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Carusone\u2019s claims. Researchers face hurdles to studying on-platform behavior Researchers from non-profits and academic institutions have had a harder time studying X since Musk\u2019s takeover in 2022. Academics need large samples of posts, shares, likes and other data to study social media trends in mis- and disinformation, public health, elections and other key topics. But one of Musk\u2019s first changes at X was to put access to platform data behind a steep paywall. Researchers and civil society groups said the new subscription fees \u2014 costing up to $2.5 million a year \u2014\u00a0were \u201coutrageously expensive\u201d and made it impossible to do their work, reducing transparency of a critical platform. The change may have forced some researchers to rely more heavily on first-person observational data to draw conclusions about user behavior on X. Groups like CCDH have also used automated \u201cscraping\u201d of publicly viewable content from X rather than paying the company for data directly, a tactic that helped give rise to X\u2019s initial lawsuit. Efforts by X and other social media companies to limit research transparency makes them less accountable to the public at best and, at worst, could mask malicious behavior, said David Karpf, an associate professor in the School of Media and Public Affairs at George Washington University. \u201cWe need independent research to have any real measure of what\u2019s going on at X/Twitter. Musk is only ever going to release data that makes his company look good,\u201d Karpf said. \u201cThese platforms are too big and too vital to the spread of information to be left unmonitored.\u201d \u201cThis is an election year,\u201d Karpf added, \u201cand the platforms are taking steps to make it harder to monitor how their services are used for malignant ends.\u201d Free Press, another media accountability organization that has been critical of Musk\u2019s leadership of X and which called for advertisers to pause their spending on the platform shortly after his takeover, also celebrated Breyer\u2019s ruling as potentially removing at least one hurdle that watchdog organizations face. \u201cThe guardrails for democracy are hanging by a thread and we have dwindling insights into platform practices as researchers face lawsuits, congressional subpoenas and other scare tactics,\u201d said Nora Benavidez, senior counsel and director of digital rights at Free Press. Ultimately, Benavidez called the ruling \u201ca reminder that platform accountability is essential and will inevitably prevail when up against bullies like Musk who try to silence us.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/judges-stern-rebuke-of-elon-musks-x-gives-researchers-fresh-hope/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_20_business_target-price-cuts", "text": "Target has slashed prices on more than 1,500 popular items beginning immediately, ranging from butter to laundry detergent, as the retailer attempts to attract inflation-wary shoppers turned off by high prices. Prices have dropped effective Monday, with \u201cthousands more price cuts\u201d \u2014 amounting to 5,000 items \u2014 being reduced over the summer, the retailer announced. The lower prices will aim to \u201ccollectively save consumers millions of dollars\u201d on household staples and everyday items such as milk, fresh fruit, diapers and even pet food. The changes affect name brands, like Clorox and Prime energy drink, as well as its house brands. Although prices vary depending on city, Target highlighted some examples with a 75-count canister of Clorox wipes being reduced to\u00a0$4.99\u00a0from\u00a0$5.79 and one pound of unsalted butter from its Good & Gather brand dropping to $3.79 from $3.99. Other major retailers, like Ikea and Aldi, have been reducing prices in recent months in an attempt to re-attract consumers into stores and entice them to spend money, since many have slashed their spending because of inflation. Shoppers have pulled back for a year now as costs have risen 20% to 30% higher than they were three years ago and as incomes failed to keep up, Sarah Wyeth, managing director, retail and consumer with S&P Global Ratings, recently told CNN. Retail sales growth has taken a hit because of high prices: Last month, retail sales were unchanged from March, when spending increased by a downwardly revised 0.6%, the Commerce Department recently reported. In April, spending missed the 0.4% increase that economists had projected, according to FactSet. The figures are adjusted for seasonal swings but not inflation. By comparison, a year ago, retail sales surged by 3%. For Target, the price cuts are also an attempt to turn around sales, which fell last year for the first time since 2016, amid a predicted sluggish 2024. The retailer will give an update on this year\u2019s sales when it reports earnings Wednesday. Like other big box stores, business has slowed for Target since shoppers stocked up at its locations and online during the height of the pandemic in 2020 and 2021. Since its surge, Target\u2019s core middle-class customer base has been strained by higher prices and pulled back on discretionary goods such as home decor, electronics and nonessential clothing. In response, Target recently created a new house brand called Dealworthy to take on dollar stores and Walmart. The budget-friendly lineup consists of 400 items, from phone chargers to disposable plates and even underwear.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/business/target-price-cuts/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_21_opinions_sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic", "text": "The biggest tech news this week is the\u00a0ouster\u00a0of Sam Altman from his role as CEO of OpenAI, a move that has shaken the company and the industry. Hundreds of OpenAI employees have threatened to\u00a0resign. Altman has already\u00a0moved on\u00a0to a role at Microsoft. And OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is on its\u00a0third CEO\u00a0in as many days. It\u2019s all very juicy. But this drama should also be raising larger questions, far beyond one company\u2019s internal hirings and firings, including: Who are the people making the decisions\u00a0that will determine so much of our technological future? What guiding principles are they using to make those decisions? And how should other institutions \u2013 governments, non-tech industries, global alliances, regulatory bodies \u2013 reign in the worst excesses of potentially dangerous AI innovators? OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, with an explicit mission to harness what may soon be superhuman intelligence \u201cto benefit humanity as a whole.\u201d But that sensibility hasn\u2019t lasted. The company now has a multi-billion-dollar for-profit arm. They have been developing new technologies at lightning speed, and sometimes sending them out to the public\u00a0before some employees believed they were ready. The company has already reportedly invented an AI technology so dangerous they will never release it \u2013 but they also\u00a0won\u2019t tell\u00a0reporters or the public exactly what it is. This dynamic \u2013 a potentially dangerous technology developed at extreme speed, largely behind closed doors \u2013 is partly to blame for Altman\u2019s firing. The OpenAI board, according to\u00a0CNN\u2019s David Goldman, worried that \u201cthe company was making the technological equivalent of a nuclear bomb, and its caretaker, Sam Altman, was moving so fast that he risked a global catastrophe.\u201d At particular issue seemed to be Altman\u2019s efforts to make the tools behind ChatGPT available to anyone who wanted to make their own version of the chatbot. This could be widely disastrous, some board members worried. But then they fired him without warning, and apparently without involving Microsoft, the company\u2019s largest shareholder. Now, Altman is at the new AI group at Microsoft, and one has to wonder if the oversight and caution there will be on par with that at OpenAI, or if he\u2019ll be handed carte blanche to push as fast and hard as he wants. And for all the justified reticence of the OpenAI board, the company has carried out much of its work in secrecy \u2013 without the public really understanding what a handful of unaccountable technologists are building, and how it is nearly guaranteed to indelibly change their lives. AI is broadly understood to have the potential to reshape vast swaths of human existence. At the very least, it seems nearly guaranteed to change how we process information, how we communicate, how we learn and how we work (and if we work). And the ramifications could be much more extreme. AI technologies have already demonstrated the ability\u00a0to lie and to cover their tracks. They have already been able to\u00a0suggest the design\u00a0to make a virus spread more quickly. Many researchers\u00a0acutely understand\u00a0just how quickly these machines could develop the capacity to annihilate us, including Altman: He has a prepper\u2019s paradise prepared in Big Sur, complete with guns and \u201cgas masks from the Israeli Defense Force\u201d in case AI goes off the rails and the robots go to war against humans,\u00a0according to reporting in the New Yorker. But don\u2019t worry, he told an Atlantic reporter: If AI is determined to wipe us out, \u201cno gas mask is helping anyone.\u201d (If you want an excellent and terrifying rundown of AI\u2019s risks \u2013 at least those we understand right now, which are almost certainly a mere sliver of the looming perils \u2013\u00a0the Atlantic profile of Altman and his technology\u00a0is worth a read). AI is very exciting technology. But it is also a potentially very dangerous one, and not in the social media sense of \u201cit may give us bad self-esteem and make us lonelier\u201d but in the sense of \u201cit could break down human societies and kill us all.\u201d Given the life-altering potential of AI \u2013 that even if it doesn\u2019t kill us all, it will almost certainly change human existence in unprecedented ways at unprecedented speed \u2013 we all have a stake in how it\u2019s being developed. And yet the development is being left to a handful of people (who seem to be\u00a0largely\u00a0men) in Silicon Valley, and other tech pockets around the globe. And we all have a stake in whose interests AI will serve \u2013 and right now, its development is being funded with billions of dollars by people expecting to make a huge profit. Do the interests of the public align with the interests of the shareholders to whom profit-driven, potentially tremendously lucrative-for-a-few companies are beholden? Or with the interests of tech entrepreneurs who are primarily excited about being at the forefront of the AI revolution, regardless of the potential human costs? One thing is clear: AI is coming. And how it is built and unleashed on the public matters more than perhaps any technology of the past century. It is, indeed, up there with the atom bomb in its destructive potential \u2013 except likely more difficult to regulate and control. \u201cRegulation\u201d does not begin to scratch the surface of what\u2019s needed to make sure that the AI future is not a catastrophic one, especially since the development of AI is now a massive international arms race, with particularly horrific implications if bad actors develop this technology first. But regulation is, at minimum, a necessary step. So is transparency: In the US, companies have wide leverage to work behind a veil of secrecy, and much of what AI companies do is kept secret to stymy competition. But the public certainly has a right to understand what life-altering technologies are set to be inflicted upon us, and what the creators are doing to protect humanity \u2013 our jobs, our communities, our families, our connections, our educations and our abilities to build a life of purpose, but also our lives and our safety. The Altman story is fascinating because Altman is the most powerful figure in AI technology, which in effect makes him one of the most powerful men in the world. But that should give us pause: Who is he, what power does he hold, what is he doing with it, who does he answer to, and are we comfortable with this much life-altering potential being held by a few unaccountable people?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/21/opinions/sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_media_netflix-cable-bundle-news", "text": "Editor\u2019s Note: A version of this article first appeared in the \u201cReliable Sources\u201d newsletter.\u00a0Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here. Netflix\u00a0is rebuilding the cable bundle, sans one important ingredient: news. The company, having blown up the decades-old linear television business and ushered in the costly and destabilizing era of streaming, is inching closer and closer to resembling the entertainment behemoths of yesteryear. Netflix has added advertisements to its plans, a move it initially resisted for several years, touting more than 40 million monthly active users on its ad-supported tier on Wednesday. It has added live late-night comedy, most recently with the roast of\u00a0Tom Brady\u00a0and\u00a0John Mulaney\u2019s \u201cEverybody\u2019s In L.A.\u201d\u00a0And it has made great strides into the live-sports arena, despite public statements asserting it does not wish to wade far into such waters. On Wednesday, the streaming giant announced that it had struck a groundbreaking deal with the\u00a0NFL\u00a0to broadcast not one, but two games on\u00a0Christmas Day\u00a0this year. Those games add to the company\u2019s ever-growing portfolio of live-sports offerings, including\u00a0WWE \u201cRaw,\u201d\u00a0which will air exclusively on the platform starting next year. \u201cLast year, we decided to take a big bet on live \u2014 tapping into massive fandoms across comedy, reality TV, sports and more,\u201d\u00a0Bela Bajaria, Netflix chief content officer, said in a statement explaining the decision. Notably absent from Bajaria\u2019s statement and the company\u2019s programming strategy, however, is news. Netflix has shown little-to-no interest in investing in either live-news or pre-taped programming (a la, a show akin to\u00a0\u201cVice News Tonight\u201d\u00a0or\u00a0\u201c60 Minutes\u201d). To date, it has neither publicly discussed nor launched any such projects. And in conversations with talent agents, it has made clear that the streamer has no interest in even dabbling in the news business. \u201cThe entertainment platforms are not interested in news,\u201d one talent agent, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told me. \u201cTheir audiences don\u2019t want it and it can be polarizing. It\u2019s just not worth it for them.\u201d In actively avoiding the news, Netflix joins\u00a0Meta\u00a0as a pioneering technology and media company that has upended the business models news organizations have relied on for decades, only to turn its back on the industry. To be fair to these companies, there are plenty of business reasons to avoid dabbling in the news. First, news reporting is simply not as popular as entertainment content. Second, and perhaps more importantly for these companies, news has become incredibly polarizing in recent years. Simply stating that the 2020 presidential election was not stolen \u2014\u00a0a proven fact\u00a0\u2014 alienates Republicans. That polarizing factor means that not only is it more difficult to sell advertisements around the content, but that by carrying such programming, there is a chance a swath of the customer base will be turned off by the brand and motivated to unsubscribe. Which is all to say that Netflix investing in news programming would translate into spending money on content that is not as popular as other genres, but far more risky to the overall business. From a purely business standpoint, avoiding that type of programming makes sense. Of course, the counterargument is that these companies perhaps have a civic responsibility to invest in news and public affairs programming \u2014 especially since they contributed greatly to the destruction of the business model that had supported television newsrooms for so long. Journalists are crucial to thriving democracies and the hollowing out of the news industry has vast implications for the future of the free world. It\u2019s anything but unprecedented for large media companies to invest money in journalism.\u00a0Warner Bros. Discovery\u00a0has\u00a0CNN.\u00a0Comcast\u00a0has\u00a0NBC News.\u00a0Disney\u00a0has\u00a0ABC News.\u00a0Paramount\u00a0has\u00a0CBS News.\u00a0The list goes on. And, back when cable was ascendant and disruptive, as Netflix is today, the major carriers financed the birth of\u00a0C-SPAN,\u00a0offering the public a continuous feed of its government at work. So, is it really out of the question to wonder whether a streamer like Netflix should consider a similar move to offer news programming that informs and enriches the public? Rebuilding the traditional cable package without news is akin to putting together a meal that includes steak, potatoes and ice cream, but not the broccoli. The vegetables might not be the tastiest, most popular item on the menu, but neglecting them would not be healthy. Likewise, only investing in comedy and sports might be more satisfying for its audience, but it certainly isn\u2019t a healthy choice for society. That is the destination, though, where the current decisions are leading. And as the streaming revolution continues to take the wind out of the traditional cable bundle by poaching the rights to live sports, the once-towering television news outlets will be further diminished, turning the situation even more dire.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/media/netflix-cable-bundle-news/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "business"}}

On Sunday, China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce said it was launching an anti-dumping probe into polyoxymethylene or POM copolymers, a thermoplastic used in various industries ranging from auto parts to electronics, imported from the US, the European Union, Taiwan and Japan. Thermoplastics are malleable when heated but become fixed in a solid shape when cooled, and can partially replace metals such as copper and zinc. The investigation should take a year to complete, but may be extended by another six months, the ministry added. The announcement comes days after President Joe Biden said that tariffs on $18 billion worth of imports of Chinese electric vehicles (EVs) and an array of other products would soar over the next two years. EVs imported from China will see their tariffs nearly quadruple from 27.5% to 100%, a policy lever meant to challenge Beijing\u2019s practice of encouraging aggressively low pricing by domestic EV manufacturers while levying a 40% tariff on US car imports. The White House said the measures were designed to protect American workers and businesses in the face of China\u2019s unfair trade practices, including \u201cflooding global markets with artificially low-priced exports.\u201d In response, China has vowed to take \u201call necessary actions to protect its legitimate rights.\u201d The EU is also investigating state support for Chinese EV makers and, if it finds that their prices are artificially low, it will announce extra import duties by early July.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/business/china-anti-dumping-us-eu-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "business"}}

However, it\u2019s clear that there is something different about Dex; she\u2019s an entirely virtual \u201cdigital human,\u201d designed by a startup in the UK. For her performances, Dex is displayed on a video screen or as a holographic projection, with her mixes created by humans. She is animated using Unreal Engine \u2014 a 3D modeling software widely used in video games \u2014 combined with motion-capture.

According to CEO and founder Rob Sims, digital humans can help bridge the gap between AI technology and people. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve found is when people start working with and conversing with a digital human, they very quickly suspend disbelief,\u201d Sims tells CNN. \u201cIt becomes natural.\u201d AI explosion Since OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT was launched in November 2022, considerable hype has surrounded the potential of generative AI \u2014 artificial intelligence powered by huge datasets of information, capable of generating text outputs in a conversational way. Record levels of investment into generative AI have followed, with over $21 billion poured into the industry during the first nine months of last year, according to data insights company Pitchbook. In March 2023, Google launched Bard (recently renamed Gemini) and around the same time Anthropic released its AI assistant Claude. As generative AI chatbots become increasingly ubiquitous, Sum Vivas is one of several companies looking to make them more human. US and New Zealand-based UneeQ has developed animated conversational \u201cdigital humans\u201d that can be used as virtual sales reps and customer service agents on company websites, and this month it debuted Sama 2.0, an animated cabin crew member that answers questions on Qatar Airways\u2019 website and app. Microsoft recently announced that users of its Azure software would be able to create lifelike avatars capable of turning text prompts into animated speech. However, there are widespread concerns about the impact AI could have on the job market.  \u201cWhen we rely on automated tools, what skills are we losing in the process?\u201d asks Jennifer Ding, senior researcher at the Alan Turing Institute, the UK\u2019s national institute for data science and artificial intelligence. \u201cIn some ways, we think of AI as something that\u2019s helping us or augmenting our work,\u201d she says. \u201cHowever, alongside, this fear of replacement is bubbling up more and more.\u201d Harris, however, points to new opportunities within digital human design and development. \u201cEvery scenario that we found, we\u2019re creating jobs and working in harmony with people rather than taking away jobs,\u201d she says. \u201cDigital humans, first and foremost, should work with other human colleagues,\u201d adds Sims. \u201cWe\u2019ll move into a stage where digital humans will start to become just another member of the team, with added benefits for that team, and obviously the customers they serve.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/business/digital-humans-ai-dj-dex-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_03_01_tech_aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl", "text": "A London-based technology company is looking to \u201cdemocratize\u201d talent-identification and scouting in soccer using a mobile app. Free to download and available globally, the aiScout app allows aspiring soccer stars to enter virtual trials for professional clubs by uploading self-recorded footage of themselves completing a series of drills. It offers 75 exercises, designed to test a range of skills, with videos showing users how to complete them. Performances are automatically scored by artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The data can then be accessed by clubs, allowing their scouts to peruse scores for viable talent, honing their search with a variety of filters; from age and gender to position on the pitch. The app currently has two English Premier League (EPL) partners, Chelsea and Burnley, and clubs can tailor their in-app trials to meet specific needs and set their own benchmarks by having their academy players complete the same drills. \u201cWe\u2019re putting that data up front to make better use of [the scouts\u2019] time,\u201d said Richard Felton-Thomas, chief operating officer of ai.io, the company behind the app. \u201cTo say [to scouts], \u2018Go over to this place today because there\u2019s three players in that game that are all actually beating your Chelsea standard\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s going to be the best use of your time.\u2019\u201d It already appears to be working for some. Ben Greenwood had never had a trial with a professional club until he downloaded the app in 2019. After uploading footage of himself, the 17-year-old landed a trial with Chelsea, becoming the first user of the app to get a trial with a pro club. He signed a contract\u00a0with EPL team Bournemouth\u00a0in 2021. \u2018It\u2019s more about evolution\u2019 Having beta-tested in with players spanning 125 countries, Greenwood among them, 135 players have been trialed or signed by pro clubs or national teams through the app \u2014 which fully launched in September 2023 \u2014 according to Felton-Thomas. Just over 100,000 players make up the current database, but with over 100 clubs lined up to join Chelsea and Burnley, as well as a multi-year partnership with Major League Soccer in the US announced last May, Felton-Thomas projects user numbers to surge into the millions as the operation ramps up this year. Felton-Thomas said the \u201clion\u2019s share\u201d of its income comes from charging clubs a license fee to run the platform. Annual fees vary depending on the size of the club and the tools they require, ranging from six figures for \u201ctier one\u201d sides like Chelsea, to thousands of pounds for clubs lower down the footballing pyramid. The use of smart technology in sport continues to expand, including\u00a0AI commentary tools and wearable tech for elite athletes. The global market for sports analytics, valued at\u00a0$2.7 billion\u00a0in 2023, is projected to grow 22% by the end of the decade, according to market research firm Grand View Research. Should soccer talent scouts be concerned about being edged out by the arrival of AI in their industry? For Felton-Thomas, new technologies can co-exist with traditional methods. \u201cIt\u2019s more about evolution than revolution,\u201d Felton-Thomas explained. \u201cWe can\u2019t tell you when that player\u2019s actually in that match, how does he deal with adversity? What happens when he\u2019s 2-0 down? What happens when someone\u2019s shouting at him? What happens when he\u2019s just made a massive mistake?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got the ability to just augment real people to do their jobs better and faster, which then gives an opportunity to the player through the AI, but you\u2019re still actually just connecting them to the human on the other side, which is the club and the scout.\u201d While football remains ai.io\u2019s primary focus, the company is looking into opportunities in other sports to launch in the coming years. Further ahead, it may branch out beyond sports. \u201cYou think about the notion that you can be at home and analyze your movements, and how this could spin into health care, physical assessments for military disciplines and emergency services,\u201d Felton-Thomas told CNN.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/01/tech/aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "business"}}

It was widely mocked for its flirtatious tone. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard questions about how we chose the voices in ChatGPT, especially Sky,\u201d OpenAI said in a post on X Monday. \u201cWe are working to pause the use of Sky while we address them.\u201d Johansson said Altman offered to hire her last September to voice the ChatGPT 4.0 system.\u00a0She said she declined the offer for \u201cpersonal reasons.\u201d \u201cTwo days before the ChatGPT 4.0 demo was released, Mr. Altman contacted my agent, asking me to reconsider. Before we could connect, the system was out there.\u201d Johansson said she hired legal counsel, and said OpenAI \u201creluctantly agreed\u201d to take down the \u201cSky\u201d voice after her counsel sent Altman two letters. \u201cIn a time when we are all grappling with deepfakes and the protection of our own likeness, our own work, our own identities, I believe these are questions that deserve absolute clarity. I look forward to resolution in the form of transparency and the passage of appropriate legislation to help ensure that individual rights are protected,\u201d Johansson wrote. CNN has reached out to OpenAI for comment on Johansson\u2019s statement. The voice in question is not derived from Johansson\u2019s, the company said in a blog post Sunday, but instead \u201cbelongs to a different professional actress using her own natural speaking voice.\u201d OpenAI said that with each of its AI voices, it tried to create \u201can approachable voice that inspires trust,\u201d one that contains a \u201crich tone\u201d and is \u201cnatural and easy to listen to.\u201d The ChatGPT voice mode that used the Sky voice had not yet been widely released, but videos from the product announcement and teasers of OpenAI employees speaking with it went viral online last week. Some who heard Sky derided it as perhaps too easy to listen to. Last week, the controversy inspired a segment on The Daily Show in which senior correspondent Desi Lydic described Sky as a \u201chorny robot baby voice.\u201d \u201cThis is clearly programmed to feed dudes\u2019 egos,\u201d Lydic said. \u201cYou can really tell that a man built this tech.\u201d Even Altman appeared to acknowledge the widespread parallels users were drawing with Johansson when he posted to X on the day of the product\u2019s announcement: \u201cher.\u201d Johansson said Altman used this post to insinuate \u201cthe similarity was intentional.\u201d \u201cHer\u201d is the title of the 2013 film in which Johansson portrays an artificially intelligent voice assistant with whom the protagonist, played by Joaquin Phoenix, falls in love, only to be left heartbroken when the AI admits she is also in love with hundreds of other users and later becomes inaccessible altogether. Questions about leadership The criticism surrounding Sky highlights broader societal concerns about the potential biases of a technology designed by tech companies largely led or funded by White men. The announcement came after OpenAI leaders were forced to defend their safety practices over the weekend after a departing employee called the company\u2019s priorities into question. Jan Leike, who formerly led a team focused on long-term AI safety but left OpenAI last week along with Co-Founder and Chief Scientist Ilya Sutskever, posted a thread on X Friday claiming that \u201cover the past years, safety culture and processes have taken a backseat to shiny products\u201d at OpenAI. He also raised concerns that the company was not devoting enough resources to preparing for a possible future \u201cartificial general intelligence\u201d (AGI) that could be smarter than humans. Altman quickly responded saying he appreciated Leike\u2019s commitment to \u201csafety culture\u201d and added: \u201cHe\u2019s right we have a lot more to do; we are committed to doing it.\u201d The company also confirmed to CNN that in recent weeks it had begun to dissolve the team Leike led, and instead was integrating members of the team across its various research groups. A spokesperson for the company said that structure would help OpenAI better achieve its safety objectives. OpenAI President Greg Brockman responded in a longer post on Saturday, which was signed with both his name and Altman\u2019s, laying out the company\u2019s approach to long-term AI safety. \u201cWe have raised awareness of the risks and opportunities of AGI so that the world can better prepare for it,\u201d Brockman said. \u201cWe\u2019ve repeatedly demonstrated the incredible possibilities from scaling up deep learning and analyzed their implications; called for international governance of AGI before such calls were popular; and helped pioneer the science of assessing AI systems for catastrophic risks.\u201d He added that as AI becomes smarter and more integrated with humans\u2019 daily lives, the company is focused on having in place \u201ca very tight feedback loop, rigorous testing, careful consideration at every step, world-class security, and harmony of safety and capabilities.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/tech/openai-pausing-flirty-chatgpt-voice/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_business_us-economy-stagflation-nightcap", "text": "When new gross domestic product figures last month showed US economic growth slowed from recent gangbuster levels, many people diagnosed the economy as having a really ugly sickness: stagflation. Symptoms of stagflation include (but are not limited to), stagnating economic growth combined with rising inflation. So March\u2019s ugly inflation report, which showed an unexpected jump in the pace of price increases, and the lackluster GDP report, made the diagnosis seem like a no-brainer. Even JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said last month the US economy \u201clooks more like the 1970s than we\u2019ve seen before,\u201d and that stagflation is a growing risk. But Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said any positive stagflation tests were false positives. \u201cI don\u2019t see the stag or the \u2018flation,\u201d he told reporters at a press conference earlier this month after Fed officials voted to leave interest rates unchanged. \u201cI was around for stagflation. It was 10% unemployment. It was high single-digits inflation and very slow growth,\u201d he added, referring to stagflation in the 1970s after a spike in oil prices during the Arab oil embargo. I, being a Gen Zer, can\u2019t speak to that period firsthand. But I agree with Powell nonetheless \u2014 the US economy is not experiencing stagflation. It may, however, be experiencing a different, far less serious condition: slackflation. What is slackflation? If you\u2019ve never heard that term before, there\u2019s a good reason \u2014 I just coined it myself.  Slackflation is a condition that\u2019s bothersome enough that you\u2019d text your mom about it and she\u2019d tell you to go to urgent care. Then, you ignore her advice and either it goes away on its own or it gets a lot worse. To use more economic lingo, slackflation is when inflation is sticky \u2014 but not out of control\u2014 and there\u2019s slack in the economy (nothing to do with the messaging app that has an incredible collection of emojis). Economic slack, a term I unfortunately cannot take any credit for, broadly describes a situation where the economy isn\u2019t performing as well as it could be. The most widely recognized symptom of economic slack is a rising unemployment rate. That\u2019s happening in the US per the latest jobs report. But it\u2019s not nearly at levels that would be cause for concern \u2014 the unemployment rate went up just a tenth of a percentage point in April to 3.9% from 3.8% in March. But that could change in the near future. One potentially worrisome sign is the pace of monthly job gains, which slowed to 175,000 last month from 315,000 in March. But many economists agree with Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee, who referred to April\u2019s gains as \u201cvery solid.\u201d On top of that, applications for first-time unemployment benefits rose to the highest level since August last week. But on the inflation front, April Consumer Price Index data released Wednesday showed a tiny bit of improvement, with the pace of both annual and monthly price increases slowing slightly. Month-to-month movements in the nation\u2019s inflation rate aren\u2019t all that meaningful to Fed officials, though. As the adage in finance goes, the trend is your friend. And the trend with inflation is not really friendly right now. After months of big improvements, it\u2019s looking like progress may be stalling in getting to the Fed\u2019s 2% inflation target. But, still, the inflation we\u2019re experiencing now is nothing compared to that seen in the 1970s and 1980s. So, what\u2019s up with all the stagflation chatter? Diane Swonk, chief economist at KPMG, summed it up nicely to me. Unlike Powell, \u201cthe majority of the labor force wasn\u2019t born\u201d when stagflation was rampant in the US economy, and therefore \u201cthere is no muscle memory of it in their lifetimes.\u201d At the same time, millennials who dominate the workforce are \u201cunable to achieve a lot of other milestones that are very important to people.\u201d Chief among those, she said, is purchasing a home \u2014 which many Americans have delayed indefinitely with record-high home prices and painfully high mortgage rates. \u201cSo, no, it\u2019s not the 1970s, but it\u2019s understandable why people are still upset.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/business/us-economy-stagflation-nightcap/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk", "text": "In a year of wild tech stories that has seen Elon Musk transform Twitter, cryptocurrency exchange FTX collapse and Silicon Valley Bank implode, this week\u2019s whiplash-inducing turmoil at OpenAI is among the most captivating. Sam Altman \u2014 the leader of one of the world\u2019s most influential AI companies, OpenAI, and perhaps the\u00a0most visible figure in the fledgling industry \u2014 was fired Friday night by the startup\u2019s directors in a surprise move. Less than five days later, he\u2019s back as the company\u2019s CEO, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. The series of extraordinary events unfolded just days after OpenAI held its\u00a0first-ever developer conference, where it laid out new, commercialized versions of its technology, including the option to customize its ChatGPT AI chatbot. If you\u2019re just catching up, here\u2019s what you missed from a week so incredible you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking the script could have been written by an early version of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Friday Around 3 p.m. ET, Altman joined a Google Meet call with most of OpenAI\u2019s board that had been convened by fellow co-founder and OpenAI chief scientist\u00a0Ilya Sutskever, during which Altman was fired and told that the news would soon be made public. Within the next half hour, the board also informed Greg Brockman, another co-founder and OpenAI president, that he would be removed from the board. Around 3:30 p.m. ET, OpenAI publicly announced that it had fired Altman over concerns that he was not always truthful with the board. The board said Mira Murati, the company\u2019s chief technology officer, would become interim CEO. OpenAI\u2019s strategic partners, including its biggest financial backer Microsoft, were also reportedly informed of Altman\u2019s ouster just minutes before the board\u2019s announcement. Hours after being fired, Altman posted on X that he \u201cloved working with such talented people\u201d and that he would have \u201cmore to say about what\u2019s next later.\u201d Brockman promptly quit. \u201cPlease don\u2019t spend any time being concerned. We will be fine,\u201d Brockman\u00a0said in a Friday post\u00a0on X. \u201cGreater things coming soon.\u201d A key factor in the CEO\u2019s firing was\u00a0tension between Altman, who favored developing AI\u00a0more aggressively, and members of the OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the unfolding events. Saturday Within 24 hours of Altman being fired, reports emerged that he and other ex-OpenAI loyalists were mulling plans for their own venture. OpenAI\u2019s board was also reportedly having second thoughts and considering asking the ousted CEO to return. Sunday By Sunday afternoon, Altman was\u00a0back at OpenAI\u2019s headquarters\u00a0\u2014 this time with a guest badge \u2014 to negotiate his potential return. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reportedly mediated the discussion. A 5 p.m. PT deadline was reportedly set for the board to agree to Altman\u2019s demands, including adding a seat for Microsoft, and reinstating him as CEO. But those talks broke down. As Sunday turned into Monday, Nadella tweeted that Altman, along with Brockman, would join Microsoft to run a new AI research group. At OpenAI, the group found a new interim CEO: Emmett Shear, the former CEO of Amazon\u2019s streaming service, Twitch. Murati would return to her role as OpenAI\u2019s chief technology officer. Monday In a post on X early Monday, Shear, who left his role at Twitch in March, described the chance to join OpenAI as \u201ca once-in-a-lifetime\u201d opportunity. He added that the company would hire an independent investigator to report on what happened in the lead-up to Altman\u2019s firing. But OpenAI employees were not convinced. More than 500 staffers signed an open letter calling on the company\u2019s board to resign and reinstate Altman and Brockman. They also threatened to follow the co-founders to Microsoft if their demands were not met. Altman posted on X, saying, \u201cwe have more unity and commitment and focus than ever before. we are all going to work together some way or other, and i\u2019m so excited. one team, one mission.\u201d The drama was far from over.\u00a0The Verge reported Monday afternoon\u00a0that Altman and Brockman could still return to OpenAI if the board members who fired him resign. And Nadella, speaking to CNBC, said he was \u201copen to both options\u201d when asked whether Altman would actually join Microsoft. \u201cLook, that is for the OpenAI board and management and the employees to choose,\u201d Nadella said. \u201cWe chose to explicitly partner with OpenAI and we want to continue to do so, and obviously, that depends on the people of OpenAI staying there or coming to Microsoft.\u201d Tuesday Altman\u00a0was reinstated late Tuesday as OpenAI\u2019s CEO, the company said on X. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman\u00a0wrote\u00a0that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his\u00a0post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it has backed with billions to bolster its ambitions in developing AI. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Nadella\u00a0said\u00a0on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_18_business_under-armour-kevin-plank-shoes", "text": "It was once hyped as a worthy rival to Nike. But at present, Under Armour, founded by a 23-year-old former college athlete, is struggling  to  \u201cjust do it.\u201d Instead, the brand that\u2019s championed on the basketball court by Stephen Curry and on the golf course by Jordan Spieth, is now struggling \u2014 badly \u2014 to find its footing in an increasingly competitive and crowded sportwear marketplace for regular folks, where younger shoppers are more googly-eyed over newer entrants like Hoka and On running shoes. Under Armour\u2019s annual sales have been sluggish at best for the past several years, while its stock has plunged 88% from its all-time high in 2015. Industry experts said the company is mired in an unpleasant mix of problems, which include an identity crisis, several management controversies, ignoring evolving market trends to its detriment, and a rotating carousel of CEOs in quick succession. One of them is Kevin Plank, its founder, who is back at the helm for a second time as CEO after being replaced in 2019. Similar to Starbucks founder Howard Schultz\u2019s past returns to Starbucks and Disney chief Bob Iger\u2019s recent return as CEO, Plank aims to right the ship at Under Armour. \u201cWhen Under Armour was growing at 20% plus numbers, people saw it as a legitimate competitor to Nike,\u201d said David Swartz, senior equity analyst with research firm Morningstar, in an interview with CNN. \u201cIt was like On or Hoka but 10 years ago. It was the upstart athletic brand that was making real inroads against Nike, the dominant name in the industry. People saw it as a company that actually could break through and take market share from Nike among the hardcore athletes,\u201d Swartz said. \u201cThat actually did happen for a while, but then that didn\u2019t last.\u201d Plank launched Under Armour in 1996 to be what the name suggests \u2014 a protective layer of clothing worn by competitive athletes sweating it out in the heat of the game. The first product was a fitted T-shirt called \u201cThe Shorty,\u201d made from moisture-wicking fabric for elite athletes to wear under their uniforms to keep them dry. Its iconic Under Armour intertwined \u201cU\u201d and \u201cA\u201d logo was strategically placed on the neckline, to keep it conspicuous. The T-shirt eventually launched the brand to the masses after it quickly gained fandom among the ranks of professional athletes. The startup\u2019s fast track to success led to Under Armour going public in 2005. It\u2019s early slogan: \u201cProtect This House.\u201d By 2010, the business had crossed $1 billion in sales. Five years later, sales surpassed $4 billion. But then the momentum started to wane. Protracted period of pain The past eight years for Under Armour have been a struggle that doesn\u2019t appear to be abating. The company on Thursday announced a restructuring of its business as its North America sales in its most recent quarter tumbled 10%. Looking ahead, the company cast a dour forecast for its current fiscal year, expecting sales to drop 15% to 17%. Layoffs will be part of the effort to right the ship but executives did not specify how many employees will lose their jobs. Under Armour also announced a $500 million share buyback, a move to reward shareholders. Plank told analysts during the earnings call on Thursday that he will shepherd a reset of the business that centers on selling fewer but more innovative products to meet the needs of athletes, significantly accelerating product development, refocusing on its men\u2019s apparel category and reducing discounts of its products. \u201cWe are simply doing too much stuff. There are too many products, too many initiatives. To reconstitute this brand, we must be highly focused and prioritize what needs to get done so that our teams know exactly what to do with a clear definition of success for them,\u201d Plank said. It can\u2019t be ignored that management issues, too, have plagued the business for years, Swartz said. \u201cThe company has essentially had five CEOs in the past five years, if you count Kevin Plank twice,\u201d said Swartz. Plank was announced as CEO \u2014 again \u2014 in March, ending the very brief year-long tenure of Stephanie Linnartz. Plank conceded during the analysts call Thursday that frequent C-suite turnover had become a serious impediment to success. \u201cWith several CEOs and heads of product, marketing in North America over the past half-decade, ongoing turnover of critical leadership has been central to our inability to stay agile and decisive,\u201d he said. String of controversies The period from 2016 onward is when \u201cthings really started to fall apart\u201d at Under Armour, Swartz said. A huge issue arose when an important channel of distribution for the brand went bankrupt and closed stores. A bulk of Under Armour products are sold through sporting goods retailers and department stores, including Macy\u2019s and Kohl\u2019s, and online. \u201cWhen Sports Authority went bankrupt in 2016 it really hurt Under Armour. It was a major customer of the brand, as is Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods,\u201d Schwartz said. In 2020, UCLA sued Under Armour for ending a $280 million sponsorship deal. The suit alleged that Under Armour was struggling before Covid-19 and that it used the pandemic as a reason to get out of the deal. The 15-year sponsorship deal, signed in 2016, was the\u00a0largest in the history\u00a0of college sports at the time. In exchange for the $280 million, UCLA\u2019s student athletes and personnel would wear and use Under Armour\u00a0(UA)-supplied products exclusively. The company reached a settlement with UCLA. The following year, Under Armour paid $9 million to settle a multi-year investigation with the US Securities and Exchange Commission into its past accounting practices, according to Footwear News. Outside of other bad press for Plank, competitors were gaining ground on Under Armour, whose high-performance sportwear offerings weren\u2019t best suited for the Lululemon-driven athleisure trend that had emerged and then dominated the way consumers dressed through the pandemic. \u201cUnder Armour has failed to latch upon streetwear, or sports style that catapulted On or Hoka or Merrell,\u201d said Zak Stambor, senior analyst, retail and ecommerce, with market research firm eMarketer, in an interview with CNN. \u201cIt needs to figure out what is next. If it can\u2019t do that, then it needs to quickly latch upon what another brand has identified as the next big thing.\u201d Stambor questioned Plank\u2019s decision to pull back from discounts at a time when consumers are hyper focused on value. \u201cIt carries the risk of decreasing demand particularly when you don\u2019t have a must-have product,\u201d he said. Stambor said this decision also stands in stark contrast to a recent move that rival Adidas has made to roll out cheaper versions of their must-have shoes. Despite it\u2019s significant challenges, Stambor said Under Armour can remain relevant in the market. \u201cIt is a very large company with huge revenue. It\u2019s not as though the brand has fully diminished in standing. It\u2019s a bit stuck,\u201d he said. \u201cUnder Armour needs to identify what it is that consumers want and lean heavily in that direction. It hasn\u2019t fully shown an ability to do so over the past few years,\u201d he said. One area that\u2019s going strong is the brand\u2019s long-term celebrity-brand partnerships, said Eric Smallwood, president of Apex Marketing Group, a sports and entertainment firm that evaluates sponsorships and advertising campaigns. \u201cUnder Armour\u2019s relationship with the \u2018The Rock\u2019, Dwayne Johnson, has been pretty effective. They\u2019ve expanded to the United Football League, which is the football league that Johnson co-owns,\u201d Smallwood said. \u201cTheir uniforms are Under Armour.\u201d Golf is another area where the brand is making inroads while the Stephen Curry partnership has kept the brand visible in the basketball world, Smallwood said. The basketball superstar Curry, arguably the best shooter in history, famously signed with Under Armour instead of Nike in 2013. Meanwhile, the brand\u2019s other major NBA star, Joel Embiid, quit Under Armour in 2023 a few months after he was named the league\u2019s most valuable player. Embiid signed a shoe deal with Skechers last month. Under Armour reportedly bid hard for a shoe deal with WNBA phenom Caitlin Clark, who many expect will sign with Nike. \u201cThe bottomline for Under Armour is for the brand to be clear about its identity,\u201d he said. \u201cAre they a shoe company? Are they an apparel company? At one point everyone else copied their mositure-wicking undershirt. Then maybe they had an identity crisis. It\u2019s going to come down to deciding if they want to evolve into a lifestyle brand or stay in performance-based products.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/18/business/under-armour-kevin-plank-shoes/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_media_nbc-news-ousts-ronna-mcdaniel", "text": "NBC News on Tuesday ousted former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel, just days after her hiring as a paid political analyst sparked intense backlash from the network\u2019s top television anchors over McDaniel\u2019s role in subverting the 2020 election and attacks on the press. \u201cThere is no doubt that the last several days have been difficult for the News Group,\u201d NBCUniversal News Group President Cesar Conde said in a memo to staff. \u201cAfter listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor.\u201d \u201cI want to personally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down,\u201d Conde continued. \u201cWhile this was a collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team, I approved it and take full responsibility for it.\u201d Ahead of the network\u2019s decision, McDaniel spent the day Tuesday interviewing attorneys in preparation for a potential legal battle with NBC, a person familiar with the matter told CNN. Creative Artists Agency, the talent agency that brokered McDaniel\u2019s deal with NBC, also parted ways with her, the person said. The reversal comes after journalists and anchors at both NBC and its cable news sibling MSNBC publicly denounced the decision to hire McDaniel as a paid analyst in a stunning and unprecedented on-air rebuke of network brass that has embarrassed the Peacock Network. McDaniel, who recently stepped down from the RNC under pressure from former President Donald Trump, was involved in attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. As head of the RNC, she was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d In the years since, McDaniel continued to claim that the election had \u201cproblems\u201d and that Biden did not legitimately win the election, fanning the flames of election denialism. NBC\u2019s announcement Friday that it had hired McDaniel was quickly met with alarm by the network\u2019s journalists. The revolt spilled into public view on Sunday when McDaniel appeared on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with moderator Kristen Welker in her first interview since she was hired by the network. Welker disclosed that the interview had been scheduled to take place prior to NBC announcing McDaniel would become a paid contributor for the network, stating that she had no involvement in her hiring. Following the interview, Chuck Todd, NBC News\u2019 chief political analyst, delivered a stinging on-air criticism of NBC executives for their decision to hire McDaniel, telling Welker, \u201cI think our bosses owe you an apology for putting you in this situation.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a reason a lot of journalists at NBC News are uncomfortable with this,\u201d Todd said, explaining that under McDaniel, the RNC engaged in \u201cgaslighting\u201d and \u201ccharacter assassination\u201d when dealing with the news media. The following day, MSNBC hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough joined Todd in protesting the decision on their program \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d \u201cTo be clear, we believe NBC News should seek out conservative Republican voices to provide balance in their election coverage, but it should be conservative Republicans, not a person who used her position of power to be an anti-democracy election denier,\u201d\u00a0Brzezinski said. \u201cWe hope NBC will reconsider its decision. It goes without saying that she will not be a guest on \u2018Morning Joe\u2019 in her capacity as a paid contributor.\u201d Nicolle Wallace, host of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cDeadline: White House,\u201d later joined in the rebuke, saying on her program that the network\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel was nothing short of a potential threat to democracy. \u201cNBC News is, either wittingly or unwittingly, teaching election deniers that what they can do stretches well beyond appearing on our air and interviews to peddle lies about the sanctity and integrity of our elections,\u201d Wallace told viewers. Rachel Maddow \u2014 the network\u2019s biggest star \u2014 later devoted the first half-hour of her prime-time program to the controversy, saying the decision to hire McDaniel was \u201cinexplicable.\u201d Maddow took issue with McDaniel\u2019s long track record of demonizing the news media, labeling the press as \u201cfake news,\u201d and launching ugly attacks on NBC News journalists and MSNBC hosts. \u201cWe do not take it personally when we get attacked, when they say they want to put us on trial and execute us for treason,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so I want to associate myself with all my colleagues at MSNBC and NBC News who have voiced loud and principled objections to our company for putting on the payroll someone who hasn\u2019t just attacked us as journalists, but someone who is part of an ongoing project to get rid of our system of government,\u201d she said of McDaniel. \u201cSomeone who is still trying to convince Americans that this election stuff doesn\u2019t really work. That this last election wasn\u2019t a real result. That American elections are fraudulent.\u201c The on-air revolt ensnared NBC\u2019s top leaders, including NBCUniversal News Group chair Cesar Conde, NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown, who were responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring. MSNBC president Rashida Jones also did not object to the decision, people familiar with the matter said. In the wake of Conde\u2019s announcement to sever ties with McDaniel, MSNBC host Joy Reid and Maddow addressed the reversal on the network\u2019s air, praising the move as \u201cbold\u201d and \u201cstrong.\u201d \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/media/nbc-news-ousts-ronna-mcdaniel/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_20_success_interest-rates-savings-cash", "text": "The Federal Reserve\u2019s benchmark interest rate remains at a 23-year high. That\u2019s thanks to the central bank\u2019s decision Wednesday to once again hold it steady, as it has done at the policy-making committee\u2019s past five meetings. That decision may be disappointing to some investors, homebuyers and those with a lot of credit card debt, since movement in the Fed\u2019s overnight lending rate influences rates \u2014 directly or indirectly \u2014 on consumer financial products (e.g., credit cards, bank loans and mortgages). But\u00a0with the Fed signaling that no rate cuts are likely until summer, it also means anyone with savings still has at least a few more months to make hay of their stash. That\u2019s because you can still get inflation-beating interest rates that will grow any money you have set aside for emergencies, vacations, down payments or any other goal in your sights over the next several years. However, that won\u2019t happen if you just let it sit in a traditional checking or savings account that yields next to nothing. There are more lucrative, low-risk options out there, with rates that are still at or near their peaks. \u201cBut perhaps not for much longer,\u201d said Ted Rossman, senior analyst at Bankrate. \u201cIf one of those fits into your financial plans, it\u2019s best to act soon.\u201d So, consider the following options when deciding where to park your hard-earned savings. High-yield online savings accounts The average annual percentage yield on bank savings accounts was just 0.52% as of March 13, according to Bankrate. That average is kept low by the biggest brick-and-mortar banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, which still are offering a paltry 0.01%. By contrast, there are still FDIC-insured online banks offering inflation-beating rates of between 4.35% and 5.35% on their high-yield savings accounts. Generally speaking, these are the best vehicles in which to keep your emergency funds for quick, easy access. Choosing between an account that pays 0.52% and one that pays 5.35% can mean forfeiting hundreds of dollars in interest. \u201cIf you put $10,000 in a savings account, that\u2019s a difference of $496 in interest earnings over the course of the year, assuming monthly compounding,\u201d Rossman said. While the rates on high-yield savings accounts have gone down a bit in recent months, \u201cwidespread cuts in online savings account rates are unlikely until the first Fed rate cut is near,\u201d said Ken Tumin, founder of DepositAccounts.com. As with any bank savings rate, high-yield savings account\u00a0rates\u00a0can change overnight, and the bank may not alert you when it lowers it. So make sure to check your monthly statement. Certificates of deposits Another high-return, low-risk investment that is great for money you likely won\u2019t need to tap for a few months or even a couple of years is a certificate of deposit. You can get the best returns on CDs through a brokerage such as Schwab, E*Trade or Fidelity. That\u2019s because you can comparison shop for CDs from any number of FDIC-insured banks and will not have to set up individual accounts with each institution. As of March 13, the average rate on a one-year CD was 1.95%, but some banks are offering as much are 5.4%. If you can get a one-year CD at, say, 5.4%, you will make $540 on a $10,000 investment. To get the greatest benefit from a CD, you have to leave the money invested for a fixed period. You can always access your principal sooner if you need to, but there may be early withdrawal penalties. As of March 20, CDs listed on Schwab.com with durations from three months up to three years were all yielding between 5.2% and 5.51%. CD rates on durations between four and 10 years ranged from 4.40% to 5.15%. Say you invest $10,000 in a one-year CD with a 5.36%\u00a0APY. At the end of that period, you\u2019d get your principal back plus $536 in interest when the CD matures, according to Bankrate\u2019s CD calculator. If you chose a two-year CD at 5.25%, you\u2019d bank an extra $1,078, assuming compounding interest. The same investment in a five-year CD at 5.15% would earn $2,854. \u201cIt makes sense to go long with CDs. To hedge your bets, include terms from one to five years. Starting a CD ladder will provide this mix,\u201d Tumin said. If you don\u2019t go through a brokerage you may get a reasonable deal from your primary bank, Tumin said. For example, he noted, Wells Fargo is still offering up to 5.01% on both 4-month and 7-month CDs. Or, at Bank of America, you can get up to 4.75% on a 7-month CD. But Tumin cautions that with any big bank CD you should take your money out at the end of the term, otherwise your bank may automatically renew it and lock you in to a much lower-yielding CD. Money market accounts and funds If you don\u2019t want to set up an online savings account at another bank, your own bank may offer you a money market deposit account that pays a higher yield than your regular checking or savings accounts. Money market accounts may have higher minimum deposit requirements than a regular savings account, but they are more liquid than a fixed-term certificate of deposit or Treasury bill, meaning they give you access to your money more quickly while still potentially giving you some of the highest yields available, said Doug Ornstein, senior manager for integrated solutions at TIAA Wealth Management. But don\u2019t confuse money market accounts with money market mutual funds, which invest in short-term, low-risk debt instruments. As of March 19, they had an average 7-day yield of 5.14%, according to the Crane Money Fund Index, which tracks the top 100 taxable money market funds. Unlike money market deposit accounts, money market mutual funds are not insured by the FDIC. But if you invest in a money market fund through a brokerage, your overall account is likely to be insured through the Securities Investor Protection Corp, which offers protection in the event your brokerage ever goes under. Treasury bills and notes Another option for money you can leave untouched anywhere from several months to a few years is to buy short-term Treasury bills and medium-term notes, which are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. Three- and six-month bills had yields of 5.39% and 5.33%\u00a0respectively on March 20 before the Fed\u2019s meeting ended, while nine-month and one-year bills were offering 5.19% and 5.08%\u00a0respectively, according to rates posted on Schwab.com for a $25,000 investment. Rates on Treasury notes with durations from two years to 10 years ranged between 4.29% and 4.72%. If you\u2019re someone who manages your portfolio like a hawk, you may feel comfortable buying T-bills on your own from TreasuryDirect.gov. But if you don\u2019t, it might be easier just to buy new issues through your brokerage account or invest in a short-term bond index fund or ETF, said Andy Smith, executive director of financial planning at Edelman Financial Engines. And if you\u2019re looking at money that will be needed in three to five years, you might consider a diversified fund of highly rated government and corporate bonds, Ornstein said. An 18-month AAA-rated corporate bond, for instance, was yielding 4.82% this week, while the three-year was at 4.49%. Meanwhile, three-year AAA-rated municipal bonds (which are issued by local governments) had a rate of 3.98%, according to Schwab.com. Don\u2019t chase yield When deciding on the best accounts and investments for your specific goals and peace of mind, it may pay to consult a fee-only fiduciary adviser \u2014 meaning, someone who doesn\u2019t get paid a commission to sell you a particular investment. What you\u2019ll always want to do is build in flexibility for yourself so you can easily access cash, regardless of your timeline for key goals. \u201cWhat happens if something changes and you need that down payment a lot sooner \u2014 or your parents need medical care fast?\u201d Smith said. That means balancing your desire for great yield with a need and desire for ease of access without penalty. Translation: Don\u2019t chase yield for yield\u2019s sake. Think of it this way, Ornstein said: Unless you have huge sums to invest or are an institutional investor, the difference between getting a 5.1% yield versus 5% is negligible, and in fact it could even cost you more if there are penalties for taking your money out early. \u201cMost of the time convenience is really important. Give up the 0.1%,\u201d he advised.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/20/success/interest-rates-savings-cash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_20_business_trump-media-quarterly-results", "text": "Trump Media & Technology Group lost more than $300 million during the first quarter and generated very little revenue, the owner of Truth Social announced in a press release Monday. The results will raise additional questions about the multi-billion dollar valuation on the newly public company, which is majority owned by former President Donald Trump. Trump Media (DJT) reported a loss of $327.6 million during the first three months of the year driven mostly by one-time losses linked to the deal that brought the company public earlier this year. The company lost $210,300 a year earlier. The company blamed the losses on non-cash expenses from the conversion of promissory notes and the elimination of previous liabilities. Trump Media reported an operating loss of $12.1 million, with a chunk of that being driven by one-time payments related to the closing of its merger with a blank-check company earlier this year. The company generated just $770,500 of revenue, marking the second-straight quarter where its revenue totaled less than $1 million. \u201cI can\u2019t emphasize enough how unusual it is for a company with this little revenue to have this high a valuation,\u201d Matthew Kennedy, senior IPO market strategist at Renaissance Capital, told CNN in an email. In the press release, Trump Media said that at this \u201cearly stage\u201d in its development, the company \u201cremains focused on long-term product development, rather than quarterly revenue.\u201d It acknowledged that its advertising business is just getting off the ground and expressed confidence that new products like streaming will boost its results in the future. \u201cBut if they\u2019re not focused on revenue, public investors have very little to go on. What metrics can we look at? How can investors determine if the company is on the right track?\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cThe company does not provide user\u00a0metrics (though we could look at app downloads or Trump\u2019s followers). It requires a lot of trust, and for now, shareholders seem to be willing to extend an enormous amount of trust. That can quickly change, as we saw in early April.\u201d Trump Media said that it has \u201csufficient\u201d cash to fund the business \u201cfor the foreseeable future.\u201d The company listed a cash balance of $274 million as of the end of March \u2014 a sum boosted by its deal to go public. \u201cAfter an unprecedented, years-long process, we have consummated our merger and dispensed with the vast bulk of merger-related expenses, leaving the Company well-capitalized and supported by a legion of retail shareholders who believe in our mission to provide a free-speech beachhead against Big Tech censorship,\u201d Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes said in a statement. ` Nunes even said Trump Media\u2019s cash balance gives the company the opportunity to explore potential mergers and acquisitions. Experts have said the price tag on Trump Media stock defies logic given the company\u2019s financial results and small footprint in social media. Jay Ritter, a finance professor at the University of Florida\u2019s Warrington College of Business, said \u201crevenue is still anemic\u201d for Trump Media. \u201cAlthough the company is not burning through its ample cash reserves rapidly, it is not generating much revenue, suggesting that there is no reason to think that the company will turn the corner and become profitable in the foreseeable future,\u201d Ritter said. Despite all the fanfare for the public listing earlier this year, Truth Social\u00a0remains a very tiny player in social media. In April, the conservative-friendly social network experienced a 19% year-over-year drop in average daily active US users on iOS and Android to just 113,000, according to market research firm Similarweb. Rival X (formerly known as Twitter) had more than 34 million users on iOS and Android, while Instagram\u2019s Threads had 3.5 million. Trump Media said its financials were reviewed by Semple, Marchal & Cooper, its newly hired accounting firm. The company\u2019s previous accounting firm was\u00a0accused of \u201cmassive fraud\u201d\u00a0by federal regulators this month. (Regulators made no allegation of wrongdoing against\u00a0Trump Media, which was not mentioned in the charges against the auditor.)", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/business/trump-media-quarterly-results/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_05_17_business_boeing-whistleblower-suicide-police-investigation", "text": "Boeing whistleblower John Barnett died by suicide, according to a police report released on Friday, bringing to end an investigation of the shocking death of a longtime employee who raised concerns about the airplane manufacturer\u2019s safety and production standards \u2013 and who sued the company, claiming Boeing illegally retaliated against him. Barnett, 62, was found dead in a vehicle on March 9 from a self-inflicted gunshot wound in Charleston, South Carolina. Officers had been dispatched to conduct a welfare check on Barnett at a Holiday Inn when he failed to show up to a deposition in his case against Boeing, according to his lawyers and a police incident report. When they arrived, responding officers found Barnett dead in the driver\u2019s seat of\u00a0a truck in the parking lot. He was holding a handgun. The initial police report also said there was a note in the truck. But Barnett\u2019s lawyers said in a statement following his death that his deposition was nearing an end and he appeared to be in good spirits. \u201cWe didn\u2019t see any indication he would take his own life. No one can believe it,\u201d his lawyers, Robert Turkewitz and Brian Knowles, said in a statement on March 12. \u201cThe Charleston police need to investigate this fully and accurately and tell the public what they find out.\u201d The Charleston Police Department on Friday concluded their investigation into Barnett\u2019s death, saying the Charleston County Coroner\u2019s Office determined that Barnett had killed himself. The investigation found that Barnett was shot in the head at close range and the weapon was found in his right hand. There was also a notebook found in the front seat of the car that showed signs that \u201che was going through a period of\u00a0serious personal distress,\u201d according to a media release about the police investigation. Police shared with CNN an image of a note left in the car, which had multiple disparaging messages directed at Boeing. \u201cAs this investigation comes to a close, we should not forget it represents the loss of Mr. Barnett\u2019s life,\u201d police said, \u201cWe extend our deepest sympathies to his family during this difficult time and hope they continue to find the strength to persevere in absence.\u201d Boeing could not immediately be reached for comment. In March, the company said it was saddened by Barnett\u2019s death. \u201cOur thoughts are with his family and friends,\u201d the company said. Accusations of safety lapses Barnett, a former quality manager who had worked at Boeing for decades, told the New York Times in 2019 that he had discovered unsafe wiring clusters in Boeing\u2019s manufacturing processes that, if severed by nearby metal slivers, could have led to the catastrophic failure of an aircraft. \u201cAs a quality manager at Boeing, you\u2019re the last line of defense before a defect makes it out to the flying public,\u201d Barnett told the Times. \u201cAnd I haven\u2019t seen a plane out of Charleston yet that I\u2019d put my name on saying it\u2019s safe and airworthy.\u201d In a statement sent to the plant\u2019s employees and provided to CNN at the time, Brad Zaback, a site leader at the plant and general manager of the 787 program, said the Times\u2019 report \u201cpaints a skewed and inaccurate picture of the program and of our team (at the plant).\u201d Zaback, who said the Times declined an invitation to visit the plant, said \u201cquality is the bedrock of who we are,\u201d adding that the plant delivers \u201cthe highest quality airplanes.\u201d Since Barnett\u2019s initial public warnings about Boeing, the company has had several high-profile safety and quality lapses, including the blowout of a door plug on a 737 Max shortly after takeoff in January.

{"id": "2024_05_20_economy_fdic-chair-gruenberg-resigns", "text": "Martin Gruenberg, head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, will step down following a scathing independent investigation detailing pervasive sexual harassment, discrimination and bullying at the agency charged with regulating the banking sector. \u201cIn light of recent events, I am prepared to step down from my responsibilities once a successor is confirmed,\u201d Gruenberg said in a statement on Monday. \u201cUntil that time, I will continue to fulfill my responsibilities as Chairman of the FDIC, including the transformation of the FDIC\u2019s workplace culture.\u201d Gruenberg\u2019s announcement of his intent to resign comes hours after Sen. Sherrod Brown, a top Democrat who leads the Senate Banking Committee, called for \u201cnew leadership\u201d at the FDIC. \ufeffGruenberg joined the FDIC board of directors almost two decades ago. He\u2019s served as chair of the agency for nearly 10 of the past 13 years. President Joe Biden will \u201csoon\u201d announce a new nominee to lead the FDIC, White House Deputy Press Secretary Sam Michel said in a statement on Monday following the news. \u201cWe expect the Senate to confirm the nominee quickly,\u201d he added. However, there\u2019s no guarantee that will happen, since confirmation processes have been known to drag on for months or longer, at which point Biden may no longer be in office. With Gruenberg remaining\u00a0until a successor is named,\u00a0there won\u2019t be\u00a0a situation where Vice Chair Travis Hill, a Republican appointee, automatically becomes chair, leaving the agency deadlocked with one other Republican and two Democratic members on the FDIC\u2019s board of directors. That would have likely stalled significant and controversial banking regulations, such as ramped-up capital requirements, from taking effect. Michel said the administration is grateful for \u201chis willingness to stay at FDIC until his successor is confirmed in order to continue to safeguard our nation\u2019s financial stability during this time of transition.\u201d Sen. Tim Scott, the top-ranking Republican on the Senate Banking Committee, slammed Gruenberg\u2019s decision not to resign immediately as well as Democrats for not putting more pressure on him to do so. \u201cThis draw-it-out strategy makes it clear that this administration is prioritizing their political agenda over protecting workers,\u201d Scott said in a statement. The FDIC commissioned a report by law firm Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton, which ultimately spurred Gruenberg\u2019s resignation. It confirmed the findings of a November Wall Street Journal investigation revealing a long-standing problematic culture. It did not find that Gruenberg alone was responsible for the issues described in depth in the report based on interviews with over 500 employees. However, it documented several instances where Gruenberg lashed out at subordinates \u201cparticularly when being delivered bad news or conveyed views with which he disagrees.\u201d That caused staffers to delay delivering news they feared would upset him. Gruenberg\u2019s temperament \u201cmay hinder his ability to establish trust and confidence in leading meaningful culture change,\u201d the report added. Gruenberg testified before lawmakers last week in a previously scheduled hearing with other top financial regulators, saying he takes \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for the findings of the report. \u201cI also acknowledge my own failures as Chairman, both in failing to recognize how my temperament in meetings impacted others and for not having identified deeper cultural issues at the FDIC sooner,\u201d he said. The FDIC declined to comment beyond Gruenberg\u2019s statement on Monday. A tricky political manuever While most Democrats stopped short of calling for Gruenberg to resign or be replaced, many expressed outrage at the mid-May hearings in the House and Senate that Gruenberg testified at. \u201cI\u2019m pissed off\u2026 If it was me in my office, I\u2019d probably be run out,\u201d said Rep. Gregory Meeks, a New York Democrat during the hearing. \u201cIt just saddens me greatly,\u201d he added, referring to the findings of the independent report. However, Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren labeled the calls Gruenberg received to resign \u201cpurely political exercise.\u201d \u201cYour resignation would do nothing to improve the culture of the FDIC but it would give Republicans a veto over bank policy,\u201d she said at the Senate hearing where Gruenberg testified. For her, it appeared it would be sufficient for him to see through implementing all the recommendations of the report, which he said he would.

Earlier this month, a bipartisan group in the US House of Representatives voted to pass a law forcing TikTok to be sold by ByteDance or face a ban from US app stores. The bill is now before the Senate, and President Joe Biden has said he would sign it if it gets to his desk. Senate leaders, however, have indicated they are taking a deliberate approach \u2014\u00a0which could lead to delays or even potentially doom the House bill. The short-form video company, owned by Chinese firm ByteDance, has denied assertions that its app poses a national security threat to US citizens. TikTok, which does not operate in China, has said that the Chinese government has never accessed US user data. Cybersecurity experts say Chinese laws require ByteDance to cooperate with that country\u2019s intelligence demands\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a fact that, given ByteDance\u2019s ownership of TikTok, could hypothetically put US user data at risk. To address that issue, TikTok has taken steps to store its US user data on cloud servers controlled by US tech giant Oracle and established internal protocols limiting access by non-US employees. TikTok acknowledged to Congress in 2022 that employees based in China could access US user data, following a report that year by BuzzFeed News that ByteDance employees had accessed that information on multiple occasions. TikTok CEO Shou Chew, in his first appearance before Congress last year, also acknowledged that several ByteDance employees were fired for spying on certain US journalists as part of a \u201cmisguided attempt\u201d to hunt down leakers within the company.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/ftc-tiktok-probe-privacy-and-security/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_19_business_pineapple-rubyglow-price", "text": "Imagine you have $400 to spend on a luxury dining experience. You might treat yourself to a tin of premium caviar, a bottle or two of very fine wine or a multi-course meal at a high-end restaurant. Or you could blow it all on a single pineapple. The Rubyglow pineapple \u2013\u2014 bred for its distinctive red exterior and its sweetness \u2014 costs $395.99 at Melissa\u2019s Produce, a California-based seller of specialty fruit and veggies. It took Del Monte, a wholesaler which sells a variety of produce but specializes in pineapple, a decade and a half to develop the red-hued fruit. A limited crop was first available in China early this year. Recently, Del Monte decided to see how the item would fare in the United States, and Melissa\u2019s starting selling it at the astronomical price. It may not seem like the best time to market a (very, very) expensive piece of fruit in America. It wasn\u2019t that long ago that soaring grocery prices made headline news, stressing out consumers and stretching their budgets thin. Still nervous about inflation and worried about unemployment, many Americans are now spending less. And yet, there\u2019s interest in premium fruit \u2014 enough to convince Del Monte to bring the Rubyglow, which is grown in Costa Rica, stateside. \u201cConsumers are willing to pay for something that\u2019s special,\u201d said Cindy van Rijswick, fresh produce strategist for Rabobank\u2019s global research team. When it comes to specialty produce, \u201cthere\u2019s always a small market for higher-end restaurants, or foodies, or certain online channels,\u201d she said. Americans have become interested in particular for new fruit varieties in recent years, paying a premium for Honeycrisp apples, Cotton Candy grapes, Sumo Citrus and vertically-grown Japanese strawberries. Now, they are hungry for different types of fruit, and are ready to shell out for exciting new options. But a $400 pineapple? That\u2019s a bit rich. The rise of premium fruit When the Honeycrisp was introduced over 30 years ago, there weren\u2019t many apple options in the supermarket. Red Delicious, Golden Delicious and, in some areas, McIntosh apples were standard fare, recalled Jim Luby, a professor in the horticultural science department at the University of Minnesota. But that was about it. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t go out to a local orchard, you didn\u2019t have that many choices.\u201d People were hungry for more, and Honeycrisp fit the bill \u2014\u00a0sweet, crisp and novel. \u201cIt became popular in Minnesota amongst our growers,\u201d said Luby, who was part of the team that developed the variety. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t that much production. So it was priced high. And yet it kept selling.\u201d Marketing new produce is a costly affair. Researchers have to breed and cross-breed, wait out the growing cycle, and start over if the fruit disappoints. Finding something that is both delicious and resilient enough to be commercially successful takes time, and a lot of painstaking work. Then plant scientists have to convince growers to make an investment in an unproven fruit, devoting resources that could be used for old favorites. But the Honeycrisp helped show that the risk can be justified. Since the apple\u2019s success, variety in the produce section has increased. Over roughly the past decade, per capita availability \u2014\u00a0a good proxy for consumption \u2014 of higher-priced fruit, like berries, mango and avocados, has increased, according to Rabobank, which drew from USDA data. In that time, availability of cheaper fruit like apples and bananas has essentially stayed flat. Some specialty fruits have even developed cult followings: those Cotton Candy grapes, named for their sweetness, hit the scene in 2011 and quickly became popular. Sumo Citrus, a hybrid of navel oranges, pomelos and mandarins, was more of a slow burn, but has exploded in recent years. In these cases, consumers have been willing to spend a little bit more. But those items are cheap in comparison to Oishii\u2019s specialty strawberries, grown indoors in a climate-controlled vertical farm. When its berries first became available to the public in 2018, Oishii charged $50 for a pack of eight. Oishii is selling more than just berries: It\u2019s selling a luxury item. The berries are packed in flat boxes that spotlight each individual fruit, more like a package for hand-crafted chocolate truffles than the mold-hiding plastic containers you see at a supermarket. Each fruit is supposed to be perfect. \u201cEven at $50, we had thousands of people on the waitlist constantly,\u201d said Oishii CEO Hiroki Koga. Buzzy or not, $50 for strawberries is not a sustainable price. Today, after rounds of funding and improved technology, Oishii\u2019s products are more readily available, and much cheaper. You can get Oishii berries at mainstream grocers for around $10-$14 per pack. Del Monte makes its move Del Monte\u2019s researchers have been coming up with different types of pineapples for years, designing proprietary fruit and often optimizing for taste. In 2020 the company launched its own pretty, giftable fruit \u2014\u00a0the Pinkglow pineapple, which has pink flesh and comes in its own special box. The Pinkglow was never supposed to be a grocery list staple, said Melissa Mackay, VP of marketing in North America at Del Monte. \u201cIt\u2019s a hostess gift, it\u2019s a Mother\u2019s Day gift,\u201d she said. It\u2019s also perfect for Instagram and TikTok, where food influencers with large followings cut open the fruit, marveled at its color and shared their reviews (the verdict: very sweet). At first, the Pinkglow was sold for about $50. Today, you can get one for far less, online between around $8 and $29 \u2014 bargain prices, relatively, but still steep for a pineapple. If you can afford it, splurging on a pink pineapple is \u201cpermissible, because you\u2019re investing in something that\u2019s good for you,\u201d said Melanie Zanoza Bartelme, associate director of Mintel Food & Drink. \u201cIt\u2019s like people who go to Erewhon and spend almost $20 on a smoothie that a celebrity created,\u201d she said, referring to the high-end Los Angeles grocery store known for collaborating with celebrities on pricey smoothies (like Hailey Bieber\u2019s Strawberry Glaze Skin Smoothie, priced at $19 for a 20-ounce cup). Still, she noted, there is a \u201cblank space between a $16 pineapple and a $400 pineapple.\u201d Is it worth it? Melissa\u2019s Produce, which sells everything from truffles to mangosteens to kumquats, describes the Rubyglow on its website as a \u201crare gem\u201d and \u201cthe pinnacle of luxury fruit,\u201d adding that \u201cfor the gourmand, it\u2019s an unforgettable gift.\u201d The pitch has had limited success. Melissa\u2019s started with 50 pineapples, according to Robert Schueller, director of public relations at Melissa\u2019s Produce. So far, it has sold about half that number over the course of a month, including to restaurants in Las Vegas and Southern California, which he said are using the fruit in displays. \u201cThere\u2019s a market for this,\u201d Schueller said. It\u2019s just a very small, very niche market. \u201cThis is not something for everybody.\u201d To try to create more buzz, Melissa\u2019s reached out to a handful of food influencers, including Bo Corley, a chef who shares recipes and other food tidbits on his social channels. The pineapple \u201cwas absolutely delightful,\u201d Corley said. \u201cThere\u2019s almost like a bitter aftertaste when you eat too much pineapple,\u201d he explained. \u201cYou don\u2019t have that with the Rubyglow.\u201d But, he said, it wasn\u2019t worth $400. Corley can see people spending to get their hands on the Rubyglow, if not for the taste of the pineapple itself then for the wow factor of the brilliant exterior. \u201cI think charcuterie boards this Christmas, Thanksgiving \u2014\u00a0you\u2019re going to see this Rubyglow as a centerpiece, especially in an affluent house,\u201d he said. In other words, people may not spend for the taste of the pineapple, but just to show off that they have it.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/19/business/pineapple-rubyglow-price/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "business"}}

Musk, the billionaire head of SpaceX and Tesla (TSLA), arrived on the Indonesian resort island of Bali by private jet before attending the launch ceremony at a community health center in the provincial capital, Denpasar. Musk, wearing a green batik shirt,\u00a0said the availability of\u00a0the Starlink service in\u00a0Indonesia would help millions in far-flung parts of the country to access the internet.\u00a0The country is home to more than 270 million people and three different time zones. \u201cI\u2019m very excited to bring connectivity to places that have low connectivity,\u201d\u00a0Musk\u00a0said, \u201cIf you have access to the internet you can learn anything.\u201d Starlink was launched at three Indonesian health\u00a0centers\u00a0on Sunday, including two in Bali and one on the remote island of Aru in Maluku.

Asked about whether he planned to also invest in Indonesia\u2019s electric vehicle industry,\u00a0Musk\u00a0said he was focused on Starlink first. \u201cWe are focusing this event on Starlink and the benefits that connectivity brings to remote islands,\u201d he said, \u201cI think it\u2019s really to emphasize the importance of internet connectivity, how much of that can be a lifesaver.\u201d Indonesia\u2019s government has been trying for years to lure\u00a0Musk\u2019s auto firm Tesla to build manufacturing plants related to electric vehicles as the government wants to develop its EV sector using the country\u2019s rich nickel resources. The tech tycoon is scheduled to meet Indonesian President Joko Widodo on Monday, where he will also address the World Water Forum taking place on the island. Communications Minister Budi Arie Setiadi, who also attended the Bali launch, said Starlink was now available commercially, but the government would focus its services first for outer and underdeveloped regions. Prior to Sunday\u2019s launch, Starlink\u00a0obtained a permit\u00a0to operate as an internet service provider for retail consumers and had been given the go-ahead to provide networks, having received a very small aperture terminal (VSAT) permit, Budi\u00a0Setiadi told\u00a0Reuters. SpaceX\u2019s Starlink, which owns around 60% of the roughly 7,500 satellites orbiting earth, is dominant in the satellite internet sphere. Indonesia is the third country in Southeast Asia where Starlink will operate.

{"id": "2024_03_15_success_best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund", "text": "The average federal tax refund is more than $3,000, according to the latest data from the IRS. Since the majority of tax filers get a refund, there\u2019s a fair chance you could get hundreds if not thousands of dollars back in overpaid taxes, especially if you\u2019re also owed a refund from your state government. That money may feel like a windfall, and it\u2019s easy to squander it on a lot of little things. But if you\u2019re looking to improve your current financial situation, here are seven ideas to consider. Well, technically six, but you\u2019ll enjoy the seventh the most. 1. Pay off high-rate debt If you are carrying a balance on your credit card and are paying 20% to 30% in interest, make this your first priority to pay down. At such sky-high rates, \u201cthe debt can grow faster than you can pay it off,\u201d said Eric Bronnenkant, a certified financial planner and head of tax at Betterment, a robo-advisory financial services firm that also has a human advice team on hand to help clients. Keyana Russ, a certified financial planner at Four Ponds Financial Planning, concurred that people\u2019s awareness of how much money they\u2019re paying in interest over time doesn\u2019t always register. \u201cWhat I usually see is people paying the minimum, or they\u2019re charging everyday expenses and not paying off the bill at the end of the month. \u2026 They don\u2019t understand how much interest they\u2019re paying,\u201d Russ said. For example, if you\u2019re carrying a $3,000 balance at 27% interest and you only pay a required minimum of $97.50 every month, it will take you 240 months (which is 20 years) just to pay off the $3,000 \u2014 and, in addition, you will have paid $3,044.57 in interest, for a total of $6,044.57, according to Bankrate.com\u2019s calculator. 2. Create or add to an emergency fund You can use your refund to start or bolster an emergency fund. When it comes to costly emergencies, there are many Americans who don\u2019t have at least three months\u2019 worth of living expenses set aside, let alone enough to easily handle an unexpected bill of $1,000. Be sure to stash the money in a high-yield savings account at an FDIC-insured bank, Russ suggested, noting that the best interest rates are typically offered by online banks. If you have high-rate debt and you\u2019re lacking emergency savings, Russ suggested you might use a portion of your refund to attack your debt and the other portion to create an emergency fund. Bronnenkant favors paying off the high-rate debt first, but, if you\u2019re low on emergency savings and need a critical repair to help keep your job \u2014 such as on your car \u2014 he said it might make sense to set aside money for that repair and put the rest toward your credit card or other high-rate debt. 3. Make an extra payment on your mortgage If you\u2019re carrying a mortgage at a high rate (e.g., 7% to 8%), and you\u2019re not saddled with credit card debt, you might consider making an extra payment or two. \u201cIt can make a difference in the long run towards your principal,\u201d Russ said.\u00a0 You can even view it as an additional form of savings, in the sense that you\u2019re saving yourself an extra 7% \ufeffor so in interest on the portion of the principal you\u2019re paying down, Bronnenkant noted. 4. Invest in a Roth IRA If your income qualifies you to contribute to a Roth IRA, you can contribute up to $7,000 this year ($8,000 if you\u2019re at least 50) with after-tax savings. That money will grow untaxed until retirement, at which point your withdrawals will be tax-free and penalty-free after age 59-1/2, assuming the account has been open for at least five years. (And note: You can still make a 2023 Roth contribution until April 15 this year. The contribution limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if you\u2019re age 50 or older. Bolstering your tax-free retirement savings is great.\u00a0But if you need to access some of your money well before you retire, you may take out any part of your contributions tax-free and penalty-free at any time, \ufeffBronnenkant said. You would only be taxed and penalized if you withdrew the earnings on your contributions before age 59-1/2. (For more information on Roth IRA withdrawal rules, here is an easy-to-understand rundown from Charles Schwab.) 5. Contribute enough to your 401(k) in 2024 to get your full employer match Speaking of retirement savings, if you\u2019re not yet contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match from your employer, a refund can make that easier. Say you get $3,000 back. You can put that money in a high-yield savings account to earn interest. Then, on your workplace 401(k) site, change your paycheck contribution levels so that by the end of the year you will have contributed $3,000 more in pre-tax money than you otherwise would have. For instance, say you\u2019re paid every two weeks and you have 20 more paychecks left until the end of the year. You can boost you biweekly contributions by $150 per paycheck ($150 x 20 = $3,000). \u201cYou want to get the max match from your employer,\u201d Bronnenkant said. 6. Invest for shorter-term goals If in the next three to 10 years you expect to buy a home, take a once-in-a-lifetime trip, renovate a room, send your kids to summer camp or have any other expensive goal, you might consider investing your refund in a diversified mix of low-cost, broad market index funds. The shorter term your goal is, the less risk you want to take. If you need the money within three years, you might consider putting your refund in certificates of deposits and US Treasury bonds. But if your goal is five to 10 years out, and you\u2019re comfortable taking on some more risk and are willing to accept fluctuations in the market, Bronnenkant said, you might put no more than 30% of your refund in a stock index fund and 70% in a total market bond fund if your risk tolerance is conservative; or 50% in each if you have a moderate risk tolerance. If you plan on sending your child to college and you have a 529 plan, you can use your refund to boost your contributions to that plan, Russ said. You may also get a tax break for your contribution depending on the state where you live. 7. Have some fun Unless you\u2019re in truly dire financial straits, if you get a large refund, you might set aside a small portion to do whatever you truly enjoy. \u201cSometimes you just want to have fun and not have it be all business,\u201d Russ said. \u201cYou can set aside some of the money to have fun.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/15/success/best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_20_investing_red-lobster-restaurants-bankruptcy", "text": "Red Lobster, which brought affordable shrimp and lobster to middle-class America and grew to become the largest seafood restaurant chain in the world, has filed for bankruptcy. The company said it had more than $1 billion in debt and less than $30 million in cash on hand. It plans to sell its business to its lenders, and in turn, it will receive financing to stay afloat. It expects to continue to close restaurants in the meantime. Red Lobster, known for its cheddar bay biscuits, crab legs and shrimp dishes, spread around the country during the 1980s and 1990s. In 2016, Beyonc\u00e9 mentioned Red Lobster in her song \u201cFormation,\u201d describing bringing a romantic partner to Red Lobster, causing sales to surge. With 578 restaurants across 44 states and Canada, Red Lobster serves 64 million customers a year, and it brings in $2 billion in annual sales, the company said in its bankruptcy filing. One in five lobster tails purchased in North America is bought by Red Lobster. But recent mismanagement, competition, inflation and other factors brought down Red Lobster, analysts and former Red Lobster employees say. Years of underinvestment in Red Lobster\u2019s marketing, food quality, service and restaurant upgrades hurt the chain\u2019s ability to compete with growing fast-casual and quick-service chains. Pioneering chain Red Lobster started in 1968 by Bill Darden, an architect of the casual dining revolution in America, and General Mills soon bought the restaurant. Red Lobster later became part of Darden Restaurants, the owner of Olive Garden and other chains. In 2014, Darden sold off Red Lobster to Golden Gate Capital, a private equity firm, for $2.1 billion. Since 2020, seafood distributor Thai Union Group, based in Thailand, has been the largest Red Lobster shareholder. Thai Union owns 49% of the company. But Red Lobster has struggled under Thai Union. The number of customers coming to Red Lobster tumbled 30% since 2019 and has only slightly improved since the pandemic. Earlier this year, Thai Union said it would divest from Red Lobster and take a $530 million loss on its investment. Former Red Lobster employees say Thai Union\u2019s cost-cutting efforts and strategy mistakes hurt the chain. \u201cThai Union forced huge cost reductions, including many that were penny wise and pound foolish because they hurt sales,\u201d a former Red Lobster executive who spoke under the condition of anonymity because of a non-disclosure agreement with the company told CNN earlier this month. Thai Union did not respond to requests for comment on that article. Red Lobster executives began to run for the doors under Thai Union\u2019s management, resulting in a huge amount of C-suite churn. Red Lobster has had five CEOs since 2021. In 2021 and 2022, Red Lobster brought on a new CEO, chief marketing officer, chief financial officer and chief information officer. All were gone within two years. Last summer, under Thai Union, Red Lobster turned $20 endless shrimp into a permanent item on the menu for the first time, instead of its traditional limited-time offer deal. The change cost the company $11 million and cut into Thai Union profit. In its bankruptcy filing, Red Lobster said it is investigating the circumstances of that promotion, which the company\u2019s management opposed. \u201cWe need to be much more careful,\u201d Thai Union CFO Ludovic Garnier said on an earnings call in November 2023. But the company in its bankruptcy filing blamed Thai Union for the losses. Noting that under the guise of a \u201cquality review,\u201d Red Lobster eliminated two of its breaded shrimp suppliers, leaving Thai Union with an exclusive deal. That led to higher costs for the restaurant chain, and did not comply with the company\u2019s typical decision-making process for picking suppliers based on projected demand. The explosive growth and popularity of fast-casual chains like Chipotle and quick-service chains like Chick-fil-A over the past two decades also squeezed Red Lobster. Casual dining has slipped from 36% of total restaurant industry sales in 2013 to 31% in 2023, according to Technomic, a restaurant research firm. In its bankruptcy filing, Red Lobster conceded it had \u201ca bloated and underperforming restaurant footprint\u201d and cited a difficult economic environment and increased competition for its recent financial failures. Bankruptcy plans Red Lobster has been telegraphing its bankruptcy for months. In January, the company hired Jonathan Tibus, a restructuring veteran, to assess its business. It named Tibus as CEO in March. Last week, the company began shutting down 93 restaurants in preparation for its bankruptcy. As it ran out of cash, the company stopped paying its vendors last year. The company plans to stay afloat with a $100 million financing agreement, it said in its bankruptcy petition.

{"id": "2024_05_20_economy_fdic-chair-gruenberg-senate-banking-committee", "text": "Sen. Sherrod Brown, a Democrat who heads the Senate Banking Committee, is calling for a leadership overhaul at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation following a scathing 234-page report\u00a0released earlier this month that detailed pervasive sexual harassment, discrimination and bullying at the agency. Brown stopped short of explicitly calling for FDIC Chair Martin Gruenberg, who was appointed by President Joe Biden, to resign. Rather, he said in a statement Monday morning, \u201cthere must be fundamental changes at the FDIC.\u201d \u201cThose changes begin with new leadership, who must fix the agency\u2019s toxic culture and put the women and men who work there \u2014\u00a0and their mission \u2014 first,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m calling on the President to immediately nominate a new Chair who can lead the FDIC at this challenging time and for the Senate to act on that nomination without delay.\u201d Brown\u2019s comments come after he chaired a hearing in which Gruenberg testified last week and received \u201cfurther outreach from FDIC employees.\u201d Succession planning Most Democrats haven\u2019t called on Gruenberg to be replaced. That\u2019s likely because if Gruenberg were to vacate his position, Vice Chair Travis Hill, a Republican appointee, would automatically become chair until a replacement is appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. Ultimately, if President Joe Biden heeds Brown\u2019s call, there\u2019s no guarantee that his new pick would be confirmed by January, when a new president could be inaugurated. The White House did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s request for a comment. Additionally, if Gruenberg is ousted, the agency would be deadlocked with one other Republican and two Democratic members on the FDIC\u2019s board of directors until a new chair is confirmed. That would likely stop significant and controversial banking regulations, such as ramped-up capital requirements, from taking effect. The FDIC is responsible for ensuring the safety and soundness of banks across the country. It is financed by banks that contribute to its deposit insurance fund. Jaret Seiberg, an analyst at TD Cowen, said it\u2019s significant that Brown didn\u2019t outright call for Gruenberg to resign. \u201cThis suggests to us that he would remain until a replacement is confirmed. That should ensure a Democratic majority that could adopt new rules,\u201d he said in a note on Monday. Brown himself is also in a sticky position as he faces one of the toughest reelection bids in his state of Ohio that could determine which party controls the Senate. That\u2019s partly why Seiberg believes Brown is attempting to appear as though he does not support Gruenberg \u201cbut he is not disrupting efforts to finalize bank safety and soundness rules.\u201d Shortly after Brown released his statement, Sheila Bair, who served as chair of the FDIC from 2006 to 2011, called on Gruenberg to resign.  \u201cI have known and worked with Chairman Gruenberg for years. But there is a desperate need for change at the FDIC,\u201d Bair, a Republican appointee, said in a post on X. \u201cFor his own sake and everyone at the FDIC, he should announce his intention to resign effective with the appointment and confirmation of a new Chair.\u201d Gruenberg commits to improving his own temperament Gruenberg was grilled by lawmakers last week in back-to-back hearings before the House and the Senate that were scheduled prior to the report\u2019s release. During the hearings, where Gruenberg testified alongside other top financial regulators, he told lawmakers he takes \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for the findings of the report. \u201cI also acknowledge my own failures as Chairman, both in failing to recognize how my temperament in meetings impacted others and for not having identified deeper cultural issues at the FDIC sooner,\u201d he said. Gruenberg did not immediately respond a request for comment, while the FDIC declined to comment. Gruenberg also agreed to take anger management courses given the report undertaken by the law firm Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton and commissioned by the FDIC documented several instances where he lashed out at subordinates \u201cparticularly when being delivered bad news or conveyed views with which he disagrees.\u201d That has caused staffers to delay delivering news they fear would upset him.

{"id": "2024_05_20_business_what-went-wrong-at-red-lobster", "text": "Last summer, Red Lobster made $20 endless shrimp a permanent menu item. Endless shrimp was a successful annual limited-time offer for Red Lobster for 20 years. But Red Lobster\u2019s latest major shareholder, Thai Union, a Bangkok-based canned seafood company, saw the promotion as a way to sell off the mountains of shrimp it was catching and turned it into an everyday item. (Thai Union became Red Lobster\u2019s largest investor in 2020.) The change cost Red Lobster $11 million. Red Lobster filed for bankruptcy Sunday, and the bankruptcy filing sheds new light on Thai Union\u2019s role in the endless shrimp mishap. Red Lobster said it is investigating the circumstances of that promotion, which Red Lobster management opposed. Under a CEO appointed at the direction of Thai Union, Red Lobster eliminated two of its breaded shrimp suppliers, leaving Thai Union with an exclusive deal to provide shrimp for the chain, the filing said. That led to higher costs, and it did not comply with the company\u2019s typical decision-making process for picking suppliers based on projected demand, according to the chain\u2019s filing. \u201cThis decision created both operational and financial issues for [Red Lobster]\u2026 saddling the company with burdensome supply obligations\u201d to Thai Union, Red Lobster said in the filing. Thai Union did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment. Endless shrimp alone didn\u2019t doom Red Lobster. The American poster child for seafood was dragged down by a range of factors, say former leaders at the chain and restaurant analysts \u2014 including handoffs between a mix of investors and corporate parents and Thai Union\u2019s mismanagement. \u201cCertain operational decisions by former management have harmed [Red Lobster\u2019s] financial situation in recent years,\u201d Red Lobster said in its bankruptcy filing. The explosive growth and popularity of fast-casual chains like Chipotle and quick-service chains like Chick-fil-A over the past two decades also squeezed Red Lobster. And years of underinvestment in Red Lobster\u2019s marketing, food quality, service and restaurant upgrades hurt the chain\u2019s ability to add Millennials to its core Baby Boomer customer base. \u201cRed Lobster was the foundation of casual dining. They had a position of power and prominence and revolutionized how American consumers eat seafood,\u201d said Alex Susskind, a professor of food and beverage management at Cornell University, in a previous interview with CNN. But the company didn\u2019t build on that foundation, Susskind said. \u201cRed Lobster had incredible popularity among Baby Boomers. They didn\u2019t bring in a newer generation.\u201d Owned by General Mills When the first Red Lobster opened in 1968 in Lakeland, Florida, an hour south of Orlando, casual dining was in its infancy. The brand was started by southern restaurateurs Bill Darden and Charley Woodsby. Darden owned several Howard Johnson\u2019s restaurants, one of the first casual dining concepts. \u201cOur motto was informal and family prices,\u201d Woodsby\u00a0later said. They saw an opportunity to bring seafood to landlocked people at more affordable prices than fine-dining restaurants. \u201cIn most of middle America, you couldn\u2019t get decent seafood. Red Lobster brought it to the masses,\u201d said Jonathan Maze, the editor in chief at Restaurant Business Magazine, a trade publication. \u201cRed Lobster was part of this casual dining revolution.\u201d Just two years into Darden and Woodsby\u2019s venture, General Mills acquired the brand. General Mills owned brands like Wheaties, Cheerios and Betty Crocker, and the company wanted to enter the restaurant industry with Red Lobster\u2019s five no-frills restaurants. By the early 1970s, with General Mills\u2019 advertising muscle behind it, Red Lobster opened restaurants across the South. Red Lobster rose quickly and was the first casual dining chain to advertise on network television, according to a Harvard Business School\u00a0study. Red Lobster also developed the first national seafood distribution system in the 1970s. \u201cMany diners preferred their seafood fried in those days, and Red Lobster\u2019s hush puppies could be considered an early \u2018signature item,\u2019\u201d Joe Lee, the first general manager at Red Lobster and later its president, said in a journal\u00a0article. \u201cFamilies were welcomed with high chairs and a 59-cent child\u2019s plate.\u201d By 1978, Red Lobster had 236 restaurants and $291 million in sales. It had 372 restaurants and $834 million in sales in 1985. In 1995, General Mills spun off its restaurant division into a new company, Darden Restaurants, named for Red Lobster founder Bill Darden. The company initially included the legacy Red Lobster chain and Olive Garden, an upstart chain General Mills had started in 1982. Red Lobster stalls But Red Lobster fell behind its sister brand Olive Garden under Darden. By 2008, Olive Garden\u2019s sales had eclipsed Red Lobster\u2019s. Darden also acquired fast-growing chains such as Longhorn Steakhouse, Capital Grille and Yard House. \u201cDarden stopped investing in Red Lobster. Things slowly deteriorated,\u201d Les Foreman, a director of operations and divisional vice president at Red Lobster from 2002 to 2022, told CNN. Red Lobster\u2019s sales began declining and Darden prioritized investments in its other brands. Darden soon faced pressure from activist investors pushing the company to split in two. Darden responded to activist pressure by announcing plans in 2013 to\u00a0sell Red Lobster, separating the chain from the rest of its business. The following year, Darden\u00a0sold Red Lobster\u00a0to Golden Gate Capital, a private equity firm, for $2.1 billion. To help fund the deal, Red Lobster spun off its real estate assets in a transaction known as a sale leaseback agreement. Red Lobster had long owned its own real estate but would now be paying rent to lease its restaurants. Sale leasebacks are very common in the restaurant industry, but the arrangement wound up hurting Red Lobster because it became stuck with leases it no longer could afford to pay. \u201cThat produced cost pressures on Red Lobster that they\u2019ve never had before,\u201d said analyst John Gordon. \u201cIt became a problem.\u201d At the same time, fast-casual and quick-service restaurants grew with lower prices, thousands of new drive-thru locations and online delivery. These chains pressured the casual dining sector. Casual dining has slipped from 36% of total restaurant industry sales in 2013 to 31% in 2023, according to Technomic, a restaurant research firm. \u2018Cutting costs everywhere\u2019 Red Lobster\u2019s controlling shareholder Thai Union also hurt the brand, say former employees and analysts. Thai Union was a top supplier of shrimp to Red Lobster for more than 20 years. In 2016, Thai Union took a $575 million minority stake in the brand. In 2020, Thai Union deepened its financial interest in Red Lobster. Thai Union saw an opportunity to grow its business and also become a bigger supplier to Red Lobster. It also tested squeezing Red Lobster\u2019s waitstaff to the breaking point to save on labor costs, switching from waiters covering three tables to 10. Red Lobster executives began to run for the doors under Thai Union\u2019s management, resulting in a huge amount of C-suite churn. In 2021 and 2022, Red Lobster brought on a new CEO, chief marketing officer, chief financial officer and chief information officer. All left the company within two years. Then came the all-you-can-eat shrimp mishap last year. \u201cWe were expecting an increase of 20% in customer traffic, but the actual number was up to 40%,\u201d Thai Union CEO Thiraphong Chansiri said in November. Two months later, Thai Union said it would divest from Red Lobster and take a $530 million loss on its investment. The company blamed the pandemic, as well as \u201csustained industry headwinds, higher interest rates and rising material and labor costs.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m going to stop eating lobster,\u201d Chansiri said this year.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/business/what-went-wrong-at-red-lobster/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_05_16_business_biden-tariffs-trade-trump-tai", "text": "US Trade Representative Katherine Tai raised eyebrows this week by dismissing concerns that President Joe Biden\u2019s new tariffs on China would increase prices for US customers like the Trump-era tariffs on China did. \u201cFirst of all, I think that that link, in terms of tariffs to prices, has been largely debunked,\u201d Tai told reporters while speaking from the White House podium on Tuesday. But that claim has been met with skepticism from economists \u2014 and even Biden\u2019s own administration. Research shows that former President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs on China did indeed raise prices on consumers and businesses \u2014 despite his claims otherwise. A person familiar with the matter told CNN on Wednesday that Tai \u201cmisspoke\u201d when she said the link between tariffs and prices has been debunked. Angela Perez, a spokesperson for the USTR, said Tai was trying to make the case that tariffs did not cause the inflation experienced during and after Covid-19. A\u00a02023 study\u00a0from the US International Trade Commission found that US importers \u201cbore nearly the full cost\u201d of the tariffs and costs largely did not get passed onto consumers. The study found tariffs imposed by former President Donald Trump did not meaningfully contribute to inflation. Goldman Sachs told clients recently that the \u201c2018-2019 tariffs clearly raised consumer prices,\u201d adding that these price hikes were \u201cborne almost entirely by US businesses and households\u201d \u2014 not Chinese exporters. Worse, Goldman Sachs found that tariffs allowed US producers and non-Chinese exporters to the US market to \u201copportunistically raise their prices as well.\u201d Notably, Tai\u2019s boss previously warned that consumers pay for tariffs. \u201cTrump doesn\u2019t get the basics,\u201d Biden said in a post on X in June 2019. \u201cHe thinks tariffs are being paid by China. Any freshman econ student could tell you that the American people are paying his tariffs.\u201d Tax Foundation economist Alex Durante told CNN he was \u201cmystified\u201d by Tai\u2019s \u201cwildly off-base\u201d comments. Maury Obstfeld, a former Obama official who is now a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, similarly dismissed Tai\u2019s claim. \u201cPresident Biden got it right in his June 2019 tweet. Higher tariffs are\u00a0a tax that falls for the most part on Americans, not foreigners,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cThe new Biden tariffs, like the more extensive ones that Trump has promised, will worsen US inflation. Consumers will suffer, as will firms that rely on imported intermediate components.\u201d After her \u201clargely debunked\u201d comment, Tai went on to note that the \u201cinflationary dynamics\u201d linked to supply chain challenges were primarily related to Covid and also from Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Of course, that point is not really in dispute. Instead, the debate typically focuses on how much corporate greed and federal stimulus contributed to price spikes, not tariffs. It is fair to debate how much the Biden tariffs will impact inflation because they are not nearly as widespread as what Trump imposed and what Trump is promising if he\u2019s reelected. During the White House briefing, Tai emphasized that the Biden administration\u2019s strategy is a \u201ctargeted strategic response that is meant to work together with the investments that we\u2019re making.\u201d Perez, the USTR spokesperson, added that these targeted tariffs \u201cwon\u2019t increase costs for the American people.\u201d \u201cBy using these tariffs strategically, we\u2019re harnessing the benefits and outweighing the costs,\u201d Perez said. Biden announced on Tuesday increased tariffs on $18 billion in Chinese imports, focusing on steel, aluminum, legacy semiconductors, electric vehicles, battery components, critical minerals, solar cells, cranes and medical products. The new tariff rates range from 100% on EVs, to 50% for solar components, to 25% for all other sectors. A senior administration official tells CNN that the White House believes the new tariffs introduced this week won\u2019t raise prices because they apply to product groups that are symbolic, but represent only a small amount of US imports. For instance, the US imported just $368 million in battery-powered vehicles from China in 2023, according to the Atlantic Council, compared to $7.4 billion in EVs from western Europe. But the Biden administration is also leaving in place Trump\u2019s sweeping tariff program affecting some $300 billion in Chinese imports, which JP Morgan economists in 2019 estimated would cost American households $1,000 each year. White House officials for years debated whether to remove certain tariffs on consumer products in a bid to ease some of those prices. In April 2022, near the height of inflation, a senior aide raised the question at an event hosted by the Bretton Woods Committee of why some tariffs remained in place that could hurt consumers. \u201cWhy do we have tariffs on bicycles or apparel or underwear?\u201d asked Daleep Singh, deputy national security adviser for international economics. Pressed to elaborate on those comments, then-press secretary Jen Psaki acknowledged that \u201csome of the tariffs implemented by the previous administration were not strategic and instead raised costs on Americans.\u201d In the end, the senior administration official said, foreign policy considerations outweighed the argument for a slight reduction in consumer prices. Biden concluded it wasn\u2019t the time to back down from the tariff position and lose leverage in challenging Beijing\u2019s unfair trade practices. Trump enacted sweeping tariffs on $300 billion in Chinese imports, setting off a trade war between the world\u2019s two biggest economies. And Trump has vowed to triple down on that strategy if he\u2019s returned to the White House, promising a 10% across-the-board tariff on imports, a 60% tariff on imports from China and a 100% tariff on foreign cars. Economists have warned that Trump\u2019s trade agenda would hurt the US economy by worsening inflation, killing jobs, depressing growth and spooking investors. The focus on Tai\u2019s comments underscores the point that no matter who wins in November, tariffs are not going away. That\u2019s encouraging news to China hawks but troubling to those concerned about protectionism and inflation. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, expressed dismay at Biden\u2019s new tariffs on Tuesday. \u201cThis is horrible news for American consumers and a major setback for clean energy,\u201d Polis said on X in response to a Biden post. \u201cTariffs are a direct, regressive tax on Americans and this tax increase will hit every family.\u201d Even though lowering tariffs could help ease inflation, Republicans, Democrats and business leaders are focused on addressing China\u2019s trade tactics. And politicians want to be seen as protecting US jobs. \u201cAny reduction in tariffs would be seen as being soft on China. And the only true bipartisan stance in DC right now is being hard on China,\u201d said Ed Mills, policy strategist at Raymond James. David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, warned that not only do tariffs raise prices, they mess with supply chains and invite retaliation. He argued that US officials could help lower inflation by negotiating lower tariff rates with China. \u201cIt\u2019s depressing to see both parties embrace protectionism, which never makes the country richer,\u201d Kelly told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s a curse on both of their houses. Tariffs make people poorer. Both parties are playing this game.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/business/biden-tariffs-trade-trump-tai/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_economy_consumer-price-index-inflation-april", "text": "All three major indexes surged to record highs Wednesday after new data showed that inflation cooled in April after ticking up recently.  The S&P 500, tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite and blue-chip Dow all closed at new record highs after the latest Consumer Price Index showed that prices were up 3.4% for the 12 months ended in April, easing from 3.5% the month before. The broad-market S&P 500 gained more than 1.2% on Wednesday and cracked the 5,300-level for the first time, closing at 5,308.15. The Nasdaq was about 1.4% higher, setting a new record at 16,742.39. The Dow, meanwhile, was up 350 points or 0.9% and teetered near the key 40,000-level, closing at 39,908. All three major indexes are tracking toward a winning week. Investors believe that the cooler inflation reading, coupled with a separate report showing weak retail sales in April, increases the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates this year. \u201cTaken [together with retail sales] this supports a Fed rate cut in the fall,\u201d Gary Pzegeo, head of fixed income at CIBC Private Wealth US, wrote in a note to clients Wednesday. \u201cMarkets are discounting a cut in September and have moved to price in a second cut by December.\u201d Wednesday\u2019s report landed mostly in line with economists\u2019 expectations, which is a welcome turnabout from January, February and March, when CPI (and other inflation gauges) came in hot, hot, and hot. \u201cThis was a good report in the context of three hotter-than-expected [CPI] reports, and it makes it look like potentially those were bumps in the road rather than a really stagnant inflation environment,\u201d Tyler Schipper, economics professor at the University of St. Thomas in Minnesota, told CNN in an interview. On a monthly basis, prices rose 0.3%, a slower pace of growth than the 0.4% seen in the two months prior, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 CPI report. Economists were expecting a 0.4% monthly increase and an annual gain of 3.4%, according to FactSet consensus estimates. Rising gasoline and shelter costs accounted for more than 70% of the monthly increase in overall inflation, according to the report. While elevated housing costs and high prices at the pump continue to weigh on Americans, Wednesday\u2019s report did provide some welcome news on another staple spending area: Grocery prices fell for the first time in a year, dropping 0.2% from March. A closely watched underlying measurement of inflation showed even more progress. Core CPI, which strips out the more volatile categories of energy and food, slowed from 3.8% to 3.6%, its lowest rate since April 2021. From the month before, core CPI ticked up by 0.3%, its slowest pace since the end of last year. Prices are cooling but some pain points remain In addition to grocery prices falling for the month, overall food prices and the cost of going out to eat saw some easing as well. Food price inflation held pat at 2.2% annually, while food away from home inflation ticked down to 4.1%, its lowest rate since May 2021. New and used car prices continued to fall from record heights; but, especially in this period of high interest rates, they remain costly endeavors \u2014 not only to purchase but also to maintain. Motor vehicle insurance continued its painful rise in April, climbing 1.8% for the month and rising to 22.6% annually. Repair and maintenance costs were flat for the month but are still running well above overall inflation at 7.6% annually. Apparel prices jumped higher for the month, with some categories such as men\u2019s shirts and women\u2019s suits up nearly 3%. For those to leap higher at a time when goods prices are seeing disinflation (in some cases, outright deflation), could be a reflection of broader trade problems globally and a potential issue for consumers \u2014 and incumbents \u2014 later this year, Schipper said. \u201cIt might not be particularly problematic now; but if you think about the fall, when it\u2019s election season, and people are doing back-to-school shopping, that could be a category that becomes politically problematic,\u201d Schipper said. A slow drift downward However, April\u2019s report did show some slight progress on what\u2019s been the biggest Achilles heel: Shelter inflation eased to 5.5%, its lowest annual rate since May 2022. Housing costs \u201chave been a pretty persistent area of pain over the past several years,\u201d John Sedunov, professor of finance and real estate at Villanova University, told CNN. The housing component of the CPI has proved frustrating for economists and other observers because the government\u2019s measurement of shelter costs come with a considerable lag. Private sector sources of real estate data have shown a cooling rental market. When taking those housing costs out of the equation, a closely watched \u201csupercore\u201d index measuring services inflation that excludes shelter costs rose just 0.2% for the month, its slowest pace since last summer. The Federal Reserve has been wanting to see meaningful process on inflation before it starts trimming back interest rates. Those rates are at a 23-year high following an aggressive, yearslong rate-hiking campaign by the central bank to throw water on smoldering demand and tame decades-high inflation. \u201cThe last month or two had looked like maybe the improvement was stalling, and this [report] looks like it\u2019s continuing at a slow pace,\u201d Erica Groshen, a former BLS commissioner who serves as senior economics adviser at the Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations, told CNN. Inflation has cooled considerably after spiking to 9.1% annually in June 2022, and the economy has remained resilient in the process \u2014 although there are signals that the once-rampant pace of spending activity has cooled. A separate report on Wednesday showed that US retail sales were flat in April. \u201cPotentially, that\u2019s an indication of consumers getting tapped out,\u201d Sedunov said. \u201cAt the end of the day, that retail softening is an indicator that maybe there\u2019s going to be less pressure on prices in certain areas going forward, which could have a continuing moderating effect on inflation.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/economy/consumer-price-index-inflation-april/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "business"}}

The agreement is the culmination of nearly a year of back and forth between Democratic state officials and the two companies, who threatened to withdraw their businesses from Minnesota over a proposed Minneapolis ordinance that would grant rideshare drivers increased worker protections. The ordinance, initially adopted in August 2023, was part of a larger effort to grant more comprehensive benefits to contract workers, who take freelance work at digital platforms like DoorDash, Instacart, Uber and Lyft. It mandated drivers be paid at least $1.40 per mile and $0.51 per minute. The rule was delayed after Lyft and Uber warned they would leave Minneapolis. State lawmakers have been focused on compromising with the companies before a July 1 deadline. Under the new agreement, the statewide minimum wage rate for rideshare drivers will be $1.28 per mile and $0.31 per minute. The rule will override the higher rate the Minneapolis City Council had initially proposed. \u201cWhen you take it as a blended rate, that results in a 20% increase in pay for drivers in the state of Minnesota,\u201d the state\u2019s Democratic House Majority Leader Jamie Long told reporters Saturday night.

{"id": "2024_05_18_business_retirement-plan-insurance-annuities", "text": "More Americans are turning 65 this year than ever before, and that number is set to creep even higher over the next few years. It\u2019s fueling a huge rollout of new retirement products \u2014 but they\u2019re not all golden tickets. An average of 11,200 Americans will reach that traditional retirement age each day in 2024, according to a recent report by the Alliance for Lifetime Income. This surge, along with new legislation that took effect recently, has led to a growing number of financial products that promise paychecks for life, no matter how long you live. But some options are difficult to reverse and, since some plans are so new, the benefits and shortfalls have not been thoroughly researched. From pensions to 401(k) plans Although she plans to stop working in about a decade, Jennifer Messina, a 51-year-old administrative assistant in Nutley, New Jersey, said she isn\u2019t worried about retirement because her husband\u2019s job affords them a union-sponsored annuity (an insurance product that pays out income) and a pension plan. With defined benefit pensions, the burden of saving and investing for retirement falls on the employer, not on employees. These plans generally offer employees payments for life, depending on that person\u2019s salary and how long they were with the company. \u201cI\u2019m really fortunate,\u201d Messina said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t really save much of anything.\u201d However, jobs offering pension plans are harder to come by compared to previous decades. Over the past 40 years, defined contribution plans, also known as 401(k) plans, have taken their place. Americans currently hold over $7 trillion in 401(k) plans, according to data from the Investment Company Institute, a trade association. These types of retirement plans put the job of saving and investing on the employee. With 401(k) plans, it\u2019s up to retirees to ensure they don\u2019t run out of money. Many people aren\u2019t able to save adequately for retirement so that potentially leaves them heavily reliant on the Social Security benefits they accrued in their working years \u2013 and those benefits aren\u2019t huge. The average retiree\u2019s monthly check this year is $1,915, according to the Social Security Administration. And even retirees with the highest earnings during their careers are getting somewhere between $2,710 and $4,873 depending on the age they are when they retire. In addition, millions of employees don\u2019t have access to a workplace savings plan or don\u2019t participate if they do. Nearly 50% of people don\u2019t have any money saved in a retirement account, according to Federal Reserve data from 2022. \u201cIt is structurally flawed,\u201d Teresa Ghilarducci, a labor economist and professor at The New School for Social Research, said of the 401(k) system. Financial companies are jumping in to fill the void However, this year has brought some changes to employer-sponsored plans. A new law, known as Secure Act 2.0, allows companies to now offer their employees access to lifetime annuity products in their 401(k)s. Enter financial companies offering new investments that echo the promise of a traditional pension: a paycheck you can count on for life. In April, BlackRock unveiled a new fund offering called LifePath Paycheck, which is a target-date retirement fund, which invests in less risky assets the closer you get to retirement. The new twist: It comes with an option to purchase annuities recommended by BlackRock. People who are in BlackRock\u2019s target date fund and elect to purchase an annuity through their workplace plan are not subject to the typical sales commission fees usually associated with buying an annuity. But they can only be in the fund if they have a managed account within their 401(k) plan and pay a management fee based on their assets. Nationwide is also offering a new target-date fund with an annuity option for 401(k) participants called Income America 5ForLife, although it\u2019s structured differently from BlackRock\u2019s product. By being in the fund you automatically will get annuity payments in retirement and those payments will be based on 5% of your balance when you retire. The product promises to continue paying that amount, even if you outlive the account\u2019s balance. Unlike a traditional annuity, you can pull your money out of the plan without penalty if you no longer wish to receive annuity payments. \u201cThis is a whole new burgeoning segment,\u201d Eric Stevenson, Nationwide\u2019s president of retirement solutions, told CNN. \u201cThis isn\u2019t your father\u2019s annuity.\u201d What are the downsides? Both products can be used with tax-deferred 401k savings or after-tax Roth 401(k) savings. For now, they are only available to employees at companies that offer them and only if they have managed accounts within the workplace savings plan. Ghilarducci cautioned that these products won\u2019t be free. And she advised that, when possible, retirees should opt to manage their savings on their own. \u201cThen you\u2019re not subject to any fees and you\u2019re not paying somebody else\u2019s profits,\u201d she said.  But for retirees looking for a guarantee that they won\u2019t run out of money, some of these new offerings may be appealing. There may be other downsides, however: As with other annuities, the monthly paychecks you get may be smaller if you elect to pass the benefit on to your spouse after you pass away, and annuities generally don\u2019t allow payments to pass on to children without incurring an additional cost. And annuities can be confusing to navigate \u2014 and with many it is difficult to remove your money after you\u2019re locked in. There\u2019s also the issue of inflation. Annuities do not necessarily offer inflation-adjusted payments, which means the value of your guaranteed paycheck will decline over time as you get older. In other words, it\u2019s always buyer beware. A steady paycheck, even one that emulates a traditional pension, might not be a perfect solution. Though she said she\u2019s not worried about her finances after retiring, Messina, the administrative assistant in New Jersey, conceded that she and her husband will likely have to downsize, even with the benefits of a pension and annuity. \u201cEven with the amount of money we\u2019ll be getting, we can\u2019t stay here in New Jersey,\u201d she said. Their next hurdle is deciding where to settle before they retire. Messina wants to relocate to South Carolina, while her husband wants to move to North Dakota.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/18/business/retirement-plan-insurance-annuities/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_media_nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash", "text": "Cesar Conde has a decision to make \u2014 and it\u2019s not an especially difficult one. The NBCUniversal News Group chair is facing a torrent of backlash from his own staff after greenlighting the hire of former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel as a paid network contributor. Over the last 24 hours, the most prominent and recognizable NBC News and MSNBC personalities have voiced strong displeasure with the company\u2019s decision to welcome McDaniel to \u201cthe team.\u201d And they\u2019re not doing it via anonymous comments to the press. They\u2019re doing it on the record on NBCU\u2019s own air. Chuck Todd broke the dam on Sunday\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with a set of candid comments about the hiring, and Rachel Maddow capped the flood of backlash Monday night with a blistering 30-minute monologue eviscerating the network\u2019s leadership for the \u201cinexplicable\u201d move. Suffice to say, NBCU News Group is in unprecedented territory. Never has a network\u2019s C-suite ever been so thoroughly flogged by its most high-profile stars in such no holds barred fashion. Saying that Conde simply has a crisis on his hands would be a contender for understatement of the year. It\u2019s a five-alarm fire at NBCU News Group, and one of Conde\u2019s own making. While NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown were most directly responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring, a decision that MSNBC boss Rashida Jones did not object to it at the time, the buck ultimately stops with Conde, who hold the real power at the Peacock Network. McDaniel\u2019s hiring could not have happened without Conde\u2019s blessing. It does not take a brilliant political mind with prescient foresight to understand that hiring McDaniel would ignite a firestorm of outrage \u2014 from both within 30 Rock and outside it. Conde, someone who ostensibly supports American democracy, should have rejected McDaniel\u2019s hiring on the grounds that NBCU News Group could not put someone on its payroll who tried to subvert the 2020 vote. As so many of NBCU\u2019s staffers have underscored, the objection to McDaniel is not that she is a Republican. It\u2019s not even that she is a Donald Trump-supporting Republican. It\u2019s that she was an active participant in the plot to overthrow the last presidential election. That is not to even mention McDaniel\u2019s years of demonizing the press, smearing the journalists who work at NBC News and MSNBC as she sought to destroy the credibility of the organization that she ran to after being chased out of the RNC. The notion put forward by NBC that it needed to hire McDaniel to bring its viewers \u201can insider\u2019s perspective on national politics and the future of the Republican Party\u201d is absurd. If that\u2019s the case, the network should move to hire free agents like Tucker Carlson or Candace Owens. They too have their hands on the pulse of the Republican Party. In fact, they represent much more of where the GOP stands today than McDaniel. So, using NBC\u2019s logic, why not hire them? (Spoiler: News organizations rightfully have established basic standards for paid contributors. Asking that your employees have a commitment to democracy, to the truth, and to basic decency is not a big ask.) But even if Conde has no allegiance to basic democratic principles, which this hire calls into question, given that he is known to be a political player who cares deeply about his own image in the press, he should have been wise enough to foresee that hiring McDaniel would be an ill-conceived move. How this did not occur to Conde is unfathomable and shows a tremendous lack of judgment. Even more bizarre is Conde\u2019s management, or lack thereof, since the controversy erupted. It was clear early on that his employees at NBC News and MSNBC did not support McDaniel\u2019s hiring. If that was not evident on Friday, it was clear as day on Sunday after \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d The network\u2019s employees were not only flabbergasted and demoralized by the move, but absolutely enraged by it. At that point, the writing should have been on the wall for Conde \u2014 as it was for every other media executive that I have spoken with over the last 24 hours. It is evident that McDaniel has no real future as an NBC analyst and the decision to bring her on as a contributor will have to be reversed. After all, which NBC or MSNBC program is going to invite her on after all of this? The only real question for Conde after the Sunday morning scolding should have been how he chose to back out of the deal in the least painful way possible. To be fully honest, I very much expected a Sunday evening announcement from NBC, one that would have earned praise from the company\u2019s staff and quickly been swept away by the rush of Trump news Monday morning. But no such announcement came. Instead, Conde has allowed the mess to spiral absolutely out of control. MSNBC\u2019s top stars hammered the network\u2019s leadership throughout the day Monday over the hire. NBC News\u2019 Guild blasted Conde, saying in a statement that under him the company had quietly laid off employees over the last month and instead chosen to \u201cprioritize an election denier over its reporters.\u201d The already severe crisis was allowed to blossom into one of the worst corporate public relations catastrophes in recent memory. All the while, Conde has remained silent. I asked his spokesperson, Stephen Labaton, on Monday whether the NBCU News Group boss had any comment on the situation. Does he have any regret? I didn\u2019t get an on-the-record response. Suffice to say, however, that what Conde does moving forward will say a lot about his character and commitment to democratic values. It will also say a lot about the NBCU News Group and what type of organization it is. In her biting monologue on Monday night, however, Maddow did offer Conde a way out of this mess. \u201cMistakes will be made,\u201d Maddow said.\u201dBut our resilience as a democracy is going to be recognizing when decisions are bad ones and reversing those bad decisions. Hearing legitimate criticism, responding to it, and correcting course. Not digging in. Not blaming others. Take a minute. Acknowledge that maybe it wasn\u2019t the right call.\u201d \u201cIt is a sign of strength, not weakness, to acknowledge when you are wrong,\u201d Maddow added. \u201cIt is a sign of strength. And our country needs us to be strong now.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/media/nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "business"}}

Shares of the tech behemoth rose 2.1% to an all-time high close of $377.44 on Monday, beating the previous record of $376.17. That comes after shares of Microsoft fell 1.7% on Friday, when Sam Altman was ousted from his position at OpenAI in a boardroom coup. Microsoft is the artificial intelligence firm\u2019s biggest stakeholder, with a $13 billion investment in the company. Greg Brockman, who co-founded OpenAI and quit after Altman\u2019s firing, is also joining Microsoft. Altman\u2019s hiring ended days of speculation that the former chief executive could return to the firm after his dramatic firing.

{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl", "text": "Sam Altman has agreed to return to lead OpenAI, the company said in a Tuesday post on X, just days after his surprise ouster as chief executive sparked an employee revolt that threatened to undermine what has been the leading company in the fledgling artificial intelligence industry. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman wrote that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft, which is the ChatGPT maker\u2019s biggest financial backer. The announcement appears to bring to an end days of chaos for the AI industry that included negotiations over who should lead OpenAI and how the firm should be run, as well as broader discussions about just how fast the arms race to develop AI technology should be moving. The details of Altman\u2019s firing and re-hiring remain murky. In its announcement Friday, OpenAI claimed that Altman had been insufficiently \u201ccandid\u201d with the board. That ambiguous language sent the rumor mill flying. But a key factor in Altman\u2019s ouster was the presence of\u00a0tensions between Altman, who favored pushing AI development more aggressively, and members of the original OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the crisis. As of Monday morning, Nadella had announced that Altman, along with fellow OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, would be joining Microsoft to lead a new AI research division. OpenAI said it had hired former Twitch chief Emmett Shear as interim CEO. But then hundreds of OpenAI employees, nearly the company\u2019s entire staff, threatened to leave, potentially for Microsoft, if the company\u2019s board didn\u2019t resign and reinstate Altman as CEO. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it invested billions in to help bolster its ambitions in developing AI, which many in Silicon Valley think will be the most important wave of technological advancement in the coming decades. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Microsoft CEO\u00a0Satya Nadella said on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d Altman\u2019s vision to quickly roll out and commercialize AI tools also appears to have won out. Publicly, Altman has long cautioned about risks posed by AI, and he\u202fhas pledged to lawmakers and customers that he would move OpenAI forward responsibly. \u201cIs [AI] gonna be like the printing press that diffused knowledge, power and learning widely across the landscape that empowered ordinary, everyday individuals that led to greater flourishing, that led above all to greater liberty?\u201d he said in a May Senate subcommittee hearing pressing for regulation. \u201cOr is it gonna be more like the atom bomb \u2014 huge technological breakthrough, but the consequences (severe, terrible) continue to haunt us to this day?\u201d But inside the company, Altman had been pushing to bring products to market more quickly and to sell them for a profit. Altman announced a few weeks ago at OpenAI\u2019s first-ever developer day that the company would make tools available so anyone could create their own version of ChatGPT. OpenAI has also worked with Microsoft to roll out ChatGPT-like technology across Microsoft\u2019s products. OpenAI and iPhone designer Jony Ive had also reportedly\u202fbeen in talks to raise $1 billion from Japanese conglomerate SoftBank for an AI device to replace the smartphone. \u2014 CNN\u2019s Juliana Liu and Diksha Madhok contributed reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_27_media_nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over", "text": "Only 80 hours elapsed between NBC News announcing Ronna McDaniel as a paid contributor and the network ousting her from that very role. But for the leadership at NBC Universal News Group, those were 80\u00a0painful hours. On Tuesday evening, following another full day in which the media rumor mill churned at warp speed, NBCU News Group boss Cesar Conde sent staff a memo, notifying his troops that he had reversed his decision to welcome the former Republican National Committee chair to \u201cthe team.\u201d \u201cAfter listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor,\u201d Conde said, adding that he wanted to \u201cpersonally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down.\u201d Conde had no real choice. The embattled NBCU boss, who I\u2019m told dealt with the crisis from an unknown location outside of 30 Rock, was facing an unprecedented rebellion from his most high-profile stars, who one by one went on the air and excoriated leadership\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel. The only aspect of Conde\u2019s note that was surprising was the fact that it came 48 hours late, allowing what started off as a crisis to fester and balloon into one of the worst corporate public relations calamities in recent memory. \u201cWhat a sh*t show!\u201d a media executive exclaimed to me Tuesday shortly after Conde relieved McDaniel of her NBC News credentials. In his note, Conde said he took \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for McDaniel\u2019s hire. But, he also did point the finger, telling staffers that hiring her was \u201ca collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team.\u201d Indeed, multiple people familiar with the matter have told me that the infighting among NBC executives over who was at fault for the disaster has reached a fever pitch, with various factions of the NBCU News Group assigning blame to others. Regardless of who is to blame, the entire affair made clear who is actually in control of the company \u2014 and it\u2019s not Conde & Co. Despite the NBCU C-suite digging their heels in the sand as they resisted dumping McDaniel for days, they were ultimately forced to succumb to pressure from their talent. As a second media executive commented to me, it is now \u201cvery clear who is in charge\u201d after the \u201cweak leadership was put on full display.\u201d \u201cHas Cesar lost the room?\u201d wondered a third media executive. While the Peacock family argues over who was really at fault, the company is facing a fresh public relations mess. Led by Donald Trump, right-wing personalities are already assailing the network as being overrun with intolerant woke leftists. \u201cThese Radical Left Lunatics are CRAZY and the top people at NBC ARE WEAK,\u201d Trump raged on his Truth Social platform. Ari Fleischer, who served as press secretary under President George W. Bush, wrote on X: \u201cWhat NBC is saying is if you\u2019re for Trump, you don\u2019t belong. Good. Let NBC be for Democrats only.\u201d Of course, that narrative is intellectually dishonest. The objection to McDaniel from both within and outside of NBCU was not that she is a Republican. It wasn\u2019t even that she was a Trump-supporting Republican. No, the objection stemmed from the fact that McDaniel was an active participant in the plot to subvert the 2020 vote. And, in addition to that disgraceful history, she had a lengthy track record smearing NBC News and MSNBC. Nevertheless, NBCU will now have to contend with such dishonest attacks being leveled by the right, which will follow them in the days, months, and even years to come. As unfair as it may be, they will certainly damage the network\u2019s brand in Republican circles \u2014 a place it had gone through great pains to appeal to. NBCU will also have to grapple with McDaniel, who spent the last 24 hours or so interviewing lawyers as she gears up for a possible legal fight with the network, according to a person familiar with the matter. The rift between McDaniel and NBCU had grown to such an extent by Tuesday that she was not informed by network brass that she had been dismissed, I\u2019m told. Instead, McDaniel learned of her ouster in press reports. While NBCU is being beaten up on the right, the company\u2019s leadership was quickly praised by its journalists and top stars. Shortly after Conde sent out his memo, Rachel Maddow appeared on Joy Reid\u2019s show, where the two lauded Conde for reversing course. \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/27/media/nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "business"}}

You can sign up\u00a0right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link. Americans with deep pockets have played a growing role in powering the US economy with their spending. But their days of splurging like there\u2019s no tomorrow might be coming to an end. US household wealth\u00a0surged in recent years, despite the scourge of high inflation and the Federal Reserve\u2019s bitter medicine of elevated borrowing costs to rein in price increases. A robust stock market coupled with rising home values have boosted Americans\u2019 wealth from 2019 through 2022, according to a Federal Reserve report on household finances. That increase is known as \u201cthe wealth effect,\u201d and it has continued to shore up Americans\u2019 finances as stocks\u00a0shatter records\u00a0and high bond yields beef up savings accounts. Plus, Americans who locked in a low mortgage rate before the Fed began to hike interest rates in 2022 and have decided to stay put\u00a0have been shielded\u00a0from the effects of high mortgage rates. Put together, that means many consumers have not only been able to withstand inflation, to a degree, but they\u2019ve also been able to spend on travel, concerts and big-ticket items. US economic growth accelerated at a brisk pace in 2023, largely thanks to the US consumer. And it\u2019s Americans older than 54 who hold the vast amount of household wealth in the US, more than 70%, according to Fed data. But the economy\u2019s momentum has slowed a bit recently with figures on\u00a0employment\u00a0and retail spending for April coming in weaker than expected. While the broader economy remains healthy, including the job market with sub-4% unemployment, there are signs that an important corner has been turned. The shifting behavior of wealthy Americans is one of them. \u201cIt\u2019s well known that the lowest income consumer is really struggling with inflation, but from a purely economic standpoint, it is the higher quintiles of earners that do the most spending,\u201d Nanette Abuhoff Jacobson, global investment strategist at Hartford Funds, told CNN. There\u2019s been some evidence of wealthy Americans growing cautious in the latest round of company earnings results. British luxury retailer Burberry reported last week that its profits plummeted by 40% in the budget year ending in late March. Sales in the Americas dropped off by 12% over the year. \u201cExecuting our plan against a backdrop of slowing luxury demand has been challenging,\u201d Jonathan Akeroyd, Burberry\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement. LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton reported in its latest earnings results last month that demand for high-end liquors has declined sharply in the US, leading to high inventory levels for the French luxury conglomerate\u2019s alcoholic beverages division. Walmart, which traditionally caters to lower and middle-income Americans, even reported last week that its gains last quarter were \u201cprimarily driven by upper-income households,\u201d or those making more than $100,000 a year. But the broader picture isn\u2019t all doom and gloom. It\u2019s been mixed: Royal Caribbean Cruises topped expectations for its first-quarter earnings results thanks to solid bookings and robust onboard spending. Demand for cruises, arguably an activity for the well-off, shows there isn\u2019t this mass retrenchment from rich Americans just yet. But some are thinking twice before swiping that card or clicking on the purchase button. Consumers overall have become more price sensitive, according to various examples in the Fed\u2019s periodic collection of anecdotes known as the Beige Book. \u201cWhen we talk to CEOs and CFOs, they\u2019re saying that people are pushing back, so companies now aren\u2019t feeling as comfortable pushing through price increases,\u201d said Jacobson of Hartford Funds. \u201cAnd company earnings in the consumer discretionary area are ones to continue to watch for signs of consumer stress.\u201d 1 in 7 Gen Z credit card users are \u2018maxed out\u2019 Ariel Barnes plunged into a credit card debt spiral in college, and a decade later she\u2019s yet to escape. Barnes, a manager of gift processing at Jackson State University, has maxed out seven credit cards and is struggling to make minimum payments on $30,000 of credit card debt. \u201cThe interest is so high that it\u2019s hard to get out of it,\u201d Barnes, who is 28 years old and lives in Jackson, Mississippi, told CNN in a phone interview on Thursday.Barnes is hardly alone. Roughly one in seven (15.3%) Gen Z credit card borrowers have maxed out their credit cards, according to new research from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. (The NY Fed defined Gen Z as borrowers born between 1995 and 2011, though others mark the cut off as 1996 or 1997). By comparison, just 4.8% of Baby Boomer borrowers and 9.6% of Gen Xers have maxed out their credit cards, which can be a sign of a severely tight cash-flow problem, my colleague Matt Egan reports.Read more here.

{"id": "2022_04_25_business_electric-hybrid-corvette", "text": "General Motors will produce a fully electric Chevrolet Corvette, GM President Mark Reuss announced in a LinkedIn post Monday morning.  Reuss didn\u2019t say when the electric Corvette would come, but he hinted that a hybrid model could come relatively soon. \u201cWe will offer an electrified Corvette as early as next year,\u201d he wrote. An accompanying video the company posted to Twitter showed what appeared to be a hybrid Corvette, and in another first, showed the front wheels spinning and throwing snow as if being powered. All Corvettes produced by the company previously have been rear-wheel-drive only. While Reuss\u2019s post implies a hybrid Corvette will be based on the current generation of the car, it\u2019s not clear if the all-electric version will be a variation of this car or a completely different future model. \u201cElectrified\u201d is an auto industry term encompassing everything from hybrid to fully electric vehicles, and anything with an electric motor can count as \u201celectrified.\u201d It has long been rumored that the current generation of the Corvette, the first with its gasoline engine mounted behind the seats instead of in the front, could be built with a hybrid system. Reuss has also previously hinted there would be electrified variants of the car. Various companies are working on electric sports cars. Most all-electric vehicles in production so far have been four-door sedans and SUVs, as the need for batteries lends itself to larger and heavier vehicles. Tesla\u2019s first car, the Lotus Elise-based Tesla Roadster, was an electric sports car, but the second-generation of Tesla Roadster, originally unveiled as a prototype in 2017, has yet to go into production. Some manufacturers, such as Lamborghini, have said that current battery technology doesn\u2019t allow for a optimum sports car performance from a purely electric vehicle. Lamborghini has been working on plug-in hybrid sports cars, though. To date, the Corvette is only available in the base Stingray version with 6.2-liter V8 engine producing up to 495 horsepower. A 670 horsepower Corvette Z06 with a 5.5-liter V8 was unveiled last fall. The previous generation of the Corvette included included a 755-horsepower ZR1 version. Nothing like that has yet been announced for the current model but GM engineers have said a major reason for putting the engine in the back was to allow for better performance at extremely high horsepower levels. Besides saving gas, hybrid systems can also be used in high-performance cars to add additional power and to provide for quicker acceleration since electric motors can provide power to the wheels more quickly than gas engines. Ferrari\u2019s most powerful sports cars are hybrids, for instance.   GM has said it plans to produce only zero-emission vehicles, meaning fully electric or powered by hydrogen fuel cells, by 2035.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/25/business/electric-hybrid-corvette/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_20_investing_premarket-stocks-trading", "text": "A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business\u2019 Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up\u00a0right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link. Markets rallied to new record highs last week and the Dow crossed the 40,000 level for the first time in its 139-year history after inflation cooled for the first time in months, stoking hopes that the Federal Reserve could start cutting interest rates as soon as September. Fed officials tamped down some of the excitement during a full slate of public appearances where they repeated that inflation was still too high for their liking. So will the central bank lower interest rates or not this fall? That\u2019s the billion dollar question. Before the Bell spoke with Tom Porcelli, chief US economist at PGIM Fixed Income, about what happens next and what it could mean for the economy. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Did you think markets reacted appropriately to last week\u2019s cooling inflation data?\u00a0 It\u2019s interesting to me that the equity market is cheering the idea that the Fed is going to be cutting rates.\u00a0If the equity market is cheering the fact that the Fed is going to extend the current economic cycle by cutting rates a couple of times, I would agree with that. I just think we have to be careful. There tends to be a fine line between cutting rates and extending the economic cycle or cutting rates because the cycle is coming to an end (and the economy is softening). All investors are really going to have to grapple with that in the coming months. Our view is that you start cutting now and you actually can extend the cycle. What do you mean exactly by extending the cycle? When the Fed is cutting rates, it\u2019s cutting rates because a recession is about to happen, right? That happens almost every single time where the Fed is cutting and recession is upon us. That\u2019s why I say there\u2019s a fine line between the Fed cutting to extend the cycle and the Fed cutting because a recession is about to happen. You really are threading a needle here. The Fed has been in this precarious space where they\u2019re trying to avoid recession while lowering interest rates. How have they done in shaping a narrative around that?\u00a0 I think you have to go back to last July. We were at 4.2%, from a core inflation perspective, that\u2019s more than double the target rate. But the Fed decided that they were done with this hiking cycle. So when you hear about the dovish pivot that happened in December, it didn\u2019t happen in December, it happened in July. (Fed Chair Jerome Powell) was taking a bit of a risk there, but part of why he shifted is because he recognized that the more aggressive the Fed goes from there, the greater damage they could do to the labor backdrop. He kept on highlighting in subsequent meetings that we cannot wait for inflation to get to 2%. Because then we run the risk of doing much more economic damage. He has tried to present themselves as a hawk. But in the end, I think Jay Powell is actually more of a dove. A lot of his actions, going back to July, are really consistent with that. I have a lot of sympathy for what he\u2019s trying to do. He\u2019s trying to engineer that ever elusive soft landing and I think he could succeed. When it comes to inflation, he can\u2019t take his eye completely off the ball, but I know that labor is top of mind right now. Do you still think the Fed will cut rates in September?\u00a0 If we\u2019re right that Powell\u2019s inclination is to cut, September is in play. And if we get a string of better inflation data between now and September, I don\u2019t doubt for a second that September is in play. How does the November election come into play? If you go back and look over the past 10 election years, it becomes clear that the Fed does adjust policy during election years. Full stop. So I think it\u2019s very fair to say that the Fed will respond to the economic reality on the ground and if the economic reality demands that the Fed adjust rates, even in an election year, even in an election month, the Fed will do it because the Fed has always done it. What happens if the Fed doesn\u2019t cut? The longer we see no cuts, the greater the risk is that you see many cuts later. There are already some signs that the economic backdrop is already weakening. You can look at rising consumer delinquency rates as an example of how higher rates are starting to clamp down again. From a corporate perspective, companies are now in the midst of refinancing. They\u2019re hitting a maturity speed bump with their debt. They\u2019re refinancing at 1 or 2 percentage points higher than where they were pre-pandemic. That could feed through to the broader economic backdrop. Right now, we have a consumer that\u2019s hanging in there, but they\u2019re starting the process of slowing their spending. That means that you\u2019re going to start to see some potential for margin compression. If you start to see margins compress in companies that are now refinancing at higher rates, you can exacerbate things. And so what do companies do? How do companies tackle margin compression, particularly if they\u2019re not able to pass on costs to the same extent that they were in recent years? They do three things. From a labor perspective, they go after hours \u2014 hours are being cut right now. If that\u2019s not enough, they try to lower wages, they\u2019re doing that right now, too. And if those two things are not enough, then the last thing you do is you go after headcount. That to me is the risk if the Fed doesn\u2019t cut anytime soon. Disneyland character performers vote to unionize You can add Mickey, Minnie, Donald and Goofy to the growing list of workers seeking better employment benefits, reports my colleague Eva Rothenberg. After three days of voting last week, 1,700 Disneyland Resort cast members who play characters around the theme park in Anaheim, California, as well as perform at parades, voted to unionize under Actors\u2019 Equity Association, the\u00a0union announced\u00a0Saturday night. Equity described the vote as \u201ca landslide victory,\u201d with 953 cast members favoring unionization and 258 opposed. The group had announced a union organizing effort in February before filing for a\u00a0vote with the National Labor Relations Board\u00a0in April. There are more than 21,000 Disneyland \u201ccast member\u201d employees, who are represented by more than a dozen unions. Those unionized jobs include workers in retail, food service, security, pyrotechnic, and hair and makeup. Until now, employees dressing up as iconic Disney characters like Mickey Mouse, Cinderella, Snow White and Captain Hook have been excluded. \u201cThese workers are on the front lines of the Guest experience; they\u2019re the human beings who create lifelong memories when your kids hug a character, or when your family watches a parade roll by the castle,\u201d said Actors\u2019 Equity Association President Kate Shindle in a statement. \u201cThe next step will be to collaborate with them about improving health & safety, wages, benefits, working conditions and job security.\u201d The labor relations board is expected to certify the results next week, after which contract negotiations with The Walt Disney Company will begin. Equity said it does not know how long the bargaining process will take, adding Disney has been \u201crelatively cooperative throughout this process.\u201d Minnesota lawmakers strike minimum pay deal for Uber, Lyft drivers Minnesota government officials have struck a deal with rideshare companies Uber and Lyft to set minimum wage standards for drivers, lawmakers announced Saturday night. The agreement is the culmination of\u00a0nearly a year of back and forth\u00a0between Democratic state officials and the two companies, who threatened to withdraw their businesses from Minnesota over a proposed Minneapolis ordinance that would grant rideshare drivers increased worker protections. The ordinance, initially adopted in August 2023, was part of a larger effort to grant more comprehensive benefits to contract workers, who take\u00a0freelance work at digital platforms\u00a0like DoorDash, Instacart, Uber and Lyft. It mandated drivers be paid at least $1.40 per mile and $0.51 per minute. The rule was delayed after\u00a0Lyft and Uber warned they would leave Minneapolis. State lawmakers have been focused on compromising with the companies before a July 1 deadline. Under the new agreement, the statewide minimum wage rate for rideshare drivers will be $1.28 per mile and $0.31 per minute. The rule will override the higher rate the Minneapolis City Council had initially proposed. \u201cWhen you take it as a blended rate, that results in a 20% increase in pay for drivers in the state of Minnesota,\u201d the state\u2019s Democratic\u00a0House Majority Leader Jamie Long told reporters Saturday night.

{"id": "2024_03_19_success_wall-street-bonuses", "text": "Last year wasn\u2019t the most lucrative for Wall Street bankers, but their bonus payouts still easily trounced US median household income. The average Wall Street bonus for 2023 was $176,500, according to estimates that will be released Tuesday morning by New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli. That\u2019s down 2% from the $180,000 recorded in 2022. Both those averages were well below the $240,000 paid out in 2021. That the average bonus was slightly down isn\u2019t surprising. Wall Street earnings last year were mixed, and merger and acquisition activity was underwhelming. \u201cWall Street\u2019s profits were up 1.8% in 2023, but firms have taken a more cautious approach to compensation and more employees have joined the securities industry, which accounts for the slight decline in the average bonus,\u201d DiNapoli said in a statement. Nevertheless, a little perspective: The average Wall Street bonus, which comes on top of the nearly half-a-million-dollar average Wall Street salary, was itself almost 2.5 times higher than the median US household income of $74,580, according to Census data for 2022. Wall Street bonuses and general employment in the securities industry provide vital revenue streams for the New York State and New York City economies, accounting most recently for 27% of the state\u2019s tax collections and 7% of city tax revenue, according to DiNapoli\u2019s office. The securities industry \ufeffin the city employed roughly 198,500 people last year, up from 191,600 the year before. And DiNapoli estimates that 1 in 11 of the city\u2019s jobs are either directly or indirectly associated with the industry. The total estimated bonus pool for 2023 was\u00a0slightly lower than the year before and is\u00a0projected to bring in $4 million less in state income tax revenue and $2 million less for the city revenue than bonuses in 2022 did. Still, DiNapoli noted, \u201cWhile these bonuses affect income tax revenues for the state and city, both budgeted for larger declines so the impact on projected revenues should be limited.\u201d It should be noted that the comptroller\u2019s numbers only reflect the bonuses paid to securities industry employees working for firms based in New York City. Beyond bringing in tax revenue for government coffers, Wall Street workers contribute substantially to the local Gotham economy. DiNapoli said that more employees in financial services (65%) are working in-office on any given day compared to 58% working in other industries in the city, at least as of September 2023. And that securities industry employees use the subway more than other workers in the city. All in, he estimates that Wall Street is responsible for roughly 14% of economic activity in the city. As critical as that is, the city and state are about much more than just Wall Street. \u201cThe securities industry\u2019s continued strength should not overshadow the broader economic picture in New York, where we need all sectors to enjoy full recovery from the pandemic,\u201d DiNapoli said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/19/success/wall-street-bonuses/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "business"}}
