Huang Xueqin, an independent journalist, was found guilty by the Guangzhou Intermediate People\u2019s Court Friday for \u201cinciting subversion of state power,\u201d supporters said. Labor activist Wang Jianbin, another defendant in the case, was sentenced to three and a half years, according to supporters, who shared a copy of the verdict on X. Huang told the court she would appeal, the supporters said, though it was not immediately clear if Wang would also appeal. Huang, 36, and Wang, 40, have already spent nearly three years behind bars within China\u2019s opaque judicial system. They were detained by authorities in the southern city of Guangzhou in September 2021 and stood trial behind closed doors in September last year. Huang, who worked as an investigative reporter for liberal-leaning media outlets in Guangzhou before becoming an independent journalist, had been an instrumental figure in sparking China\u2019s #MeToo movement. In 2018, she helped bring about the country\u2019s first #MeToo case, using her influential social media presence to amplify the voice of a graduate student who accused her PhD supervisor of unwanted sexual advances. She also spoke up about her own experiences of sexual harassment as a young intern at a national news agency, where she claimed she was groped and kissed by a senior male reporter and mentor. To show the prevalence of the issue, she surveyed 416 female journalists in 2018 and found 84% of them had experienced sexual harassment in the workplace. \u201cThere are so few people prosecuted because there are only so few victims who report,\u201d she told CNN in a 2018 interview. \u201cTo most victims, it\u2019s shame.\u201d Huang and Wang were detained the day before Huang was scheduled to fly to the United Kingdom to start her master\u2019s degree on gender violence and conflict at the University of Sussex. In a statement on Friday, Amnesty International noted the pair\u2019s conviction came a day before the 1,000th day of their first arrest. \u201cThese convictions will prolong their deeply unjust detention and have a further chilling effect on human rights and social advocacy in a country where activists face increasing state crackdowns,\u201d the rights group said. \u201cThese malicious and totally groundless convictions show just how terrified the Chinese government is of the emerging wave of activists who dare to speak out to protect the rights of others.\u201d Chinese courts are\u00a0tightly controlled by the ruling Communist Party\u00a0and have a conviction rate above 99.9%. \u2018Isolated atoms\u2019 Authorities have offered no details about Huang and Wang\u2019s charges, but supporters believe their arrest could be related to weekly friends\u2019 gatherings held at Wang\u2019s apartment. In the months following their detention, more than 70 friends and supporters of Huang and Wang were summoned by the police for questioning,\u00a0according to supporters. Some were forced to sign fabricated testimonies against the pair, claiming they had organized political gatherings to criticize the government, their supporters claimed. Huang\u2019s close friend said participants of the gatherings were a loose group of friends who cared about public affairs \u2013 from feminism, LGBTQ and labor rights to environmental protection. In addition to sharing their experiences and views, they also played board games and sometimes went hiking together. A close friend of Huang previously told CNN the journalist had suffered significant weight loss in detention and stopped menstruating for months. She was undernourished and persistent back pain, said the friend, who requested anonymity fearing retribution by authorities. \u201cIt\u2019s a community where everyone supports each other. But it\u2019s been disbanded ever since the detention. I have no sense of belonging anymore,\u201d the friend told CNN last year ahead of the closed-door trial. \u201cThe crackdown by authorities turned us into isolated atoms \u2013 it is difficult for everyone to band together again. The entire community is suppressed and silenced.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/china/china-metoo-journalist-huang-xueqin-sentenced-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_06_13_middleeast_hamas-interview-israel-gaza-hostages-intl", "text": "The fate of the 120 remaining hostages in Gaza is crucial to any deal to end the protracted and bloody conflict between Israel and Hamas. But a senior Hamas official has told CNN that \u201cno one has an idea\u201d how many of them are alive, and that any deal to release them must include guarantees of\u00a0a permanent ceasefire and the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. In an interview with CNN, Hamas spokesperson and political bureau member Osama Hamdan offered an insight into the militant group\u2019s position on the stalled ceasefire talks, a view on whether Hamas regrets its decision to attack Israel given the mounting Palestinian death toll, and a commentary on the leak earlier this week of messages from its chief in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, the man believed to be the ultimate decision-maker on any peace deal. The US believes that Hamas holds the key to the talks. \u201cThe haggling has to stop,\u201d US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told NBC on Thursday, urging Sinwar to end the war. \u201cHe\u2019s relatively safe underground; the people that he purports to represent, they\u2019re suffering every day.\u201d Speaking to CNN in the Lebanese capital Beirut, Hamdan said the latest proposal on the table \u2013 an Israeli plan that was first publicly announced by US President Joe Biden late last month \u2013 did not meet the group\u2019s demands for an end to the war. Hamdan, who has been part of the Hamas negotiations team on the ground, told CNN that the group needed \u201ca clear position from Israel to accept the ceasefire, a complete withdrawal from Gaza, and let the Palestinians to determine their future by themselves, the reconstruction, the (lifting) of the siege \u2026 and we are ready to talk about a fair deal about the prisoners exchange.\u201d Negotiations over the US-backed proposal have intensified in recent days but appeared to grind to a halt on Wednesday after Hamas presented its response to the document, 12 days after first receiving it. Blinken expressed frustration over what he said was Hamas\u2019s decision to submit \u201cnumerous changes,\u201d describing some of them as going \u201cbeyond positions (Hamas) had previously taken.\u201d \u201cSome of the changes are workable. Some are not,\u201d Blinken said at a news conference in Doha on Wednesday. The US-backed ceasefire plan that was approved by the United Nations Security Council on Monday lays out a phased approach. In the first phase, there would be a six-week ceasefire in which some hostages would be exchanged for Palestinian prisoners and the Israeli military would pull out of populated areas in Gaza. The second phase \u2013 a permanent end to the war and full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza \u2013 would only be implemented after further negotiations between the two sides. But Hamdan told CNN the duration of the ceasefire was a key issue for Hamas, which is concerned that Israel has no intention of following through with the second phase of the deal. The end of hostilities must be permanent, he said, and Israel must withdraw from Gaza completely. \u201cThe Israelis want the ceasefire only for six weeks and then they want to go back to the fight, which I think the Americans, till now, they did not convince the Israelis to accept (a\u00a0permanent ceasefire),\u201d he said, adding that he believes the US needs to convince Israel to accept a permanent ceasefire as part of the deal. Israel has not yet publicly committed to the deal, even though the White House has repeatedly stressed that it was an Israeli plan that the government had accepted. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has been under pressure to announce his support for the current plan, has repeatedly said that the war will not end until Israel eliminates Hamas. Blinken told NBC that Netanyahu \u201creconfirmed\u201d to him \u201cthat Israel supported this proposal and was ready to say yes\u201d when he saw him couple of days ago, and placed the blame for stalled negotiations squarely on Hamas. \u201cHamas has to demonstrate that it too wants this to end. If it does, we can bring it to an end. If it doesn\u2019t, then it means that it wants the war to continue,\u201d Blinken said. Question of responsibility Speaking to CNN inside a modest office decorated with a large map of Gaza and panoramic photo of the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem, Hamdan repeatedly deflected any questions about Hamas\u2019 role in the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza. He called the October 7 terror attacks, which sparked the current war in Gaza, \u201ca reaction against the occupation.\u201d The October 7 attack was the deadliest assault in Israel\u2019s history. Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups killed more than 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and also took some 250 people hostage into Gaza. Israel was quick to retaliate, immediately declaring war on Hamas and launching an intense campaign of bombardment followed by a ground invasion several weeks later. That operation has had a devastating impact on the Palestinians of Gaza. More than 37,000 people have been killed, most of them women and children, according to the health ministry in the strip. Some 90% of people living in the territory are estimated to have been displaced by the fighting. While the Gazan authorities do not distinguish between casualties among civilians and Hamas fighters, a spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has previously admitted the majority of those killed in the operation were civilians. Asked repeatedly by CNN whether Hamas regretted its decision to attack Israel, Hamdan responded by blaming the situation on Israel and saying the attack was \u201ca reaction against the occupation.\u201d \u201cThe one who is in charge or responsible for that is (the Israeli) occupation. If you resist the occupation, (they) will kill you, if you did not resist the occupation, (they) also will kill you and deport you out of your country. So what we are supposed to do, just to wait?,\u201d he said. Hamdan also dismissed as fake reports that Sinwar suggested the deaths of thousands of Palestinians were \u201cnecessary sacrifices.\u201d Sinwar has not been seen in public since the October 7 attacks. He is believed to be hiding in Gaza, somewhere inside the tunnel network that runs underneath the strip. He has been designated as a terrorist by the US, the European Union, the United Kingdom and other countries. Israel has repeatedly accused Hamas of using civilians in Gaza as human shields and earlier this week, the Wall Street Journal published what it said were leaked messages from Sinwar to other Hamas leaders in which he allegedly expressed an uncompromising determination to continue fighting, regardless of the human cost. Hamdan told CNN the messages \u201cwere fake.\u201d \u201cIt was fake messages done by someone who is not Palestinian and (it) was sent (to the) Wall Street Journal as part of the pressure against Hamas and provoking the people against the leader,\u201d he said without providing evidence. \u201cNo one can accept the killing of the Palestinians, of his own people.\u201d Destroying Hamas? When Israel launched its war on Hamas, Netanyahu said the objectives were to \u201cdestroy Hamas and bring back hostages held in Gaza.\u201d But more than eight months on, the goal of eliminating the group completely appears unachievable. While the IDF has killed some Hamas commanders, the top leadership in Gaza, including Sinwar, continues to evade them. And despite the damage caused to its infrastructure, Hamas also continues to fire rockets towards Israel, albeit much more sporadically than at the outset of the conflict. American intelligence officials believe that Sinwar likely believes Hamas can survive Israel\u2019s attempt to destroy it. At the same time, Netanyahu is under increasing pressure to reach a deal that would secure the return of the remaining hostages still in Gaza. Israel believes that more than 70 hostages of the more than 100 who are still held in Gaza to be alive. Speaking to CNN, Hamdan said he didn\u2019t know how many were still alive. \u201cI don\u2019t have any idea about that. No one has an idea about this,\u201d he said, alleging \u2013 without providing any evidence \u2013 that the Israeli operation to free four of the hostages on Saturday resulted in the deaths of three others, including an American citizen. There are fears that more hostages may be dead than are publicly known. In April, Hamas told international mediators that it was not able to fulfill Israel\u2019s demand to free 40 of the remaining hostages in the first phase of a deal, including all the women as well as sick and elderly men, because it did not hold 40 living hostages who match those criteria for release. Opposition leader Benny Gantz, who quit the Israeli war cabinet last weekend, was asked by an Israeli TV channel on Thursday whether Israel knew how many hostages are alive. He responded by saying: \u201cWe know (a) very close number,\u201d he responded. Asked about the testimony of a doctor who treated the released hostages and said they suffered mental and physical abuse and were beaten every hour, Hamdan again blamed Israel for their suffering. \u201cI believe if they have mental problem, this is because of what Israel have done in Gaza. Because (no one can) handle what Israel is doing, bombing each day, killing civilians, killing women and children \u2026 they saw that (with) their own eyes,\u201d he said, adding that comparing images of the hostages taken before and after the eight-months long captivity shows \u201cthey were better than before\u201d \u2013 a claim that is demonstrably false.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/middleeast/hamas-interview-israel-gaza-hostages-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_15_middleeast_eight-soldiers-killed-rafah-intl", "text": "Eight Israeli soldiers were killed in southern Gaza on Saturday, the Israel Defense Forces says, in one of the deadliest single incidents involving its troops since October 7. The IDF said the incident was still under review but preliminary findings suggested an armored vehicle carrying soldiers as part of a convoy had been hit by an explosion at around 5.15 a.m. local time during an operation targeting \u201cterrorist infrastructure\u201d in the northwestern part of Tal al-Sultan. \u201cAccording to the information we have at this point one of the engineering vehicles in the convoy was involved in an explosion that was apparently caused by explosive devices planted in the area or as a result of anti-tank missile fire,\u201d IDF Spokesperson Daniel Hagari told a press conference Saturday. The IDF is also investigating whether the initial explosion was compounded when explosive materiel aboard the vehicle detonated. \u201cThe current assessment is that the \u2018Nemera\u2019 armored vehicle got hit as a result of an explosion of a side bomb. In addition, on the vehicle there were engineering tools that include explosive materiel. The explosion was significant and may have been caused by the ignition of the explosive materiel on the vehicle. All this is not supposed to happen and therefore the incident is being examined,\u201d the IDF said. So great was the damage that it was difficult to identify and locate the bodies of those killed, the Israeli military added. \u201cToday we received another painful reminder of the price of war and that brave warriors and heroes were willing to sacrifice their lives for the state of Israel, which is the common home of all of us: Druze, Jews, Bedouin, Muslims and Christians. All citizens of Israel, our hearts and thoughts are with the families at this difficult time,\u201d Hagari said at the press conference. The IDF has not announced who they think was responsible for the incident. However, Al Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas, said it had \u201ccarried out a complex ambush against enemy vehicles\u201d operating in Tal al-Sultan, which lies west of the southern city of Rafah. The militant group claimed it had targeted a military bulldozer,\u00a0which then caught on fire, and that when rescue troops arrived,\u00a0it hit an armored personnel carrier with a missile strike. \u201cOur painful strikes against the enemy will continue everywhere they are present, and the occupying army will find nothing but death traps,\u201d the militant group said. Israel identified one of the dead soldiers as Captain Wassem Mahmoud, Deputy Company Commander in the Engineering Battalion. The other seven names are yet to be disclosed. We must stick to war goals: Netanyahu Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in a speech on Saturday, spoke of his \u201cdeep sorrow\u201d over the deaths, describing the enemy as \u201cloathsome and murderous,\u201d but pledged to stick to his war goals. \u201cDespite the heavy and staggering cost, we must stick to the goals of the war: destroying the military and governmental capabilities of Hamas, returning all our abductees, making sure that Gaza will no longer pose a threat to Israel and returning our residents safely to their homes \u2013 both in the north and in the south,\u201d Netanyahu said. He came under fire from opposition leader Yair Lapid, who accused Netanyahu of prioritizing political gains over national unity. Speaking at an anti-government rally in Tel Aviv, Lapid offered his condolences to the families of the eight soldiers killed in Tal al-Sultan before criticizing what he claimed was Netanyahu\u2019s response to a previous incident involving the deaths of four soldiers earlier this week. \u201cWhen the (four soldiers earlier this week) were killed, we were in the Knesset, voting on the conscription law. The whole Knesset already knew. We were all in a difficult, depressed mood, then we looked up and saw that there was one person who didn\u2019t feel that way (Netanyahu); we saw him smile,\u201d Lapid said. \u201cThat smile will bury his political career. This smile will remove him from our lives,\u201d Lapid added. The rally in Tel Aviv was attended by thousands of Israelis calling for an immediate ceasefire to secure the release of the remaining hostages. Similar protests have been taking place almost weekly. Various other ministers expressed their sorrow at the deaths, including defense minister Yoav Gallant, foreign minister Israel Katz and national security minister Itamar Ben Gvir. \u201cEight of our best sons were killed in Rafah,\u201d Katz said in a post on X. \u201cWhile knowing the price, they bravely entered Gaza to complete the mission of destroying Hamas and freeing the hostages.\u201d Meanwhile Benny Gantz, who resigned from Israel\u2019s war cabinet just days ago, described the eight soldiers as \u201cthe beautiful faces of the people of Israel, the best among us.\u201d \u201cThe heart is torn by hearing the hard news, we will never stop protecting our country, and our society\u201d Gantz added. Push into Rafah The incident comes as Israel continues its push into Rafah, where there have been reports of air strikes and artillery shelling since dawn local time. Ahmed Radwan, the media officer of\u00a0Rafah\u00a0Civil Defense, said they had received appeals to collect bodies and the injured but it was difficult for civil defense crews to access the area. Some of the fiercest fighting of recent days has been seen in Tal al-Sultan. Hamas\u00a0on\u00a0Friday said its fighters targeted\u00a0Israeli tanks\u00a0in\u00a0the neighborhood with Rocket Propelled Grenades (RPGs) and mortars, while the IDF said it found tunnels between neighboring houses used by militants as passageways. Elsewhere, at least 14 people were killed, including seven children, in Israeli strikes on central Gaza, the Civil Defense Directorate in Gaza said. In total, 30 people have been killed and 95 injured in the Gaza Strip over the past 24 hours, according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza. The conflict in Gaza began after the Hamas attacks of October 7, which killed around 1,200 people. Since then at least 37,296 people have been killed in Israel\u2019s offensive in Gaza, according to the latest figures from the Ministry of Health in Gaza.

Video circulating on social media and geolocated by CNN showed the moment the blaze engulfed the six-story building in the Mafreg area of the city. Around 150 people were living in the block when fire broke out on the ground floor, police official Sayyed Hasan Ebrahim told Kuwaiti state television. The cause of the fire, which has been contained, is unknown but the presence of more than 20 cooking gas tanks and flammable material in the overcrowded block caused it to spread quickly, Ebrahim said. Most of the fatalities were due to suffocation, Gen. Eid Rashed, from the police criminal forensic department, told state television. He warned the death toll could rise, adding that 11 people were being treated in hospitals. Authorities had identified three of the bodies, he said, but did not say if their families had been notified. A fire department official said the large number of floors and escape corridors made it difficult for the trapped residents to escape the burning building. Indian nationals were among those killed, according to the Indian foreign ministry. The country\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the fire a \u201cmishap\u201d and described it as \u201csaddening.\u201d \u201cMy thoughts are with all those who have lost their near and dear ones. I pray that the injured recover at the earliest,\u201d Modi said on X. Modi also directed his government to \u201cextend all possible assistance\u201d to the Kuwait authorities.

India\u2019s Ambassador to Kuwait, Adarsh Swaika visited several of the injured in hospital and the site of the fire. Photos of the aftermath show a blackened ground floor, with Kuwaiti security forces assessing the damage. The owner of the building has been detained and investigated for negligence, the reports added.

{"id": "2024_06_12_style_fumihiko-maki-architect-dies", "text": "Tokyo (AP) \u2014 Japanese architect Fumihiko Maki, who won the prestigious Pritzker Prize for designs praised as smartly and artfully fusing the East with the West, has died. He was 95. Maki, who taught architecture and urban design at Harvard, died June 6, his office, Maki & Associates, said Wednesday. Japanese media reports attributed the cause of death to old age. The office declined to confirm the reports. The National Museum of Modern Art in Kyoto is considered one of his classic designs, with floating forms of glass, metal and concrete. Its gray exterior appears simple at first glance but sets off patterns of reflected light on rough and polished marble. In the U.S., Maki\u2019s projects included the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco and 4 World Trade Center in New York. He also did the Makuhari Messe exhibition hall in Chiba, Japan, and the Hillside Terrace Complex in Tokyo. Maki in the 1980s designed Tokyo\u2019s Spiral building, whose management mourned his death and thanked him for \u201cthe beautiful slopes and the rich space that envisioned an urban park.\u201d In 2013, Maki\u00a0complained about the then planned spaceship-like design\u00a0of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics stadium, slamming it as too expensive and clashing with its surroundings. He said he had the support 100 other people, including architects, in opposing the size of the proposed design by British-Iraqi architect Zaha Hadid. \u201cThe problems I see with the planned stadium all relate to the issue of scale,\u201d he said.That design was eventually ditched for a more modest-looking design by\u00a0Kengo Kuma\u00a0which used pieces of wood for a natural Japanese look. Born in Tokyo in 1928, Maki was educated at the University of Tokyo, the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Michigan and Harvard University Graduate School of Design. Before opening his own design firm in 1965 in Tokyo, he worked in various offices including Skidmore Owings and Merrill, or SOM, based in Chicago, and Sert, Jackson & Associates in Cambridge, as well as the campus planning office of Washington University in St. Louis. A devoted educator, Maki, in addition to teaching at Washington University, Harvard and the University of Tokyo, lectured around the world. His essays were published in a collection called \u201cNurturing Dreams\u201d by MIT Press in 2008. In it, he explored the Japanese sense of space called \u201coku,\u201d which Maki described as \u201cthe core of this high-density space organized into multiple layers like an onion.\u201d Utilizing oku allowed the Japanese to deliver a feeling of depth even in a cramped area, according to this theory. \u201cIn the formation of urban space, certain stable concepts that have been sifted and committed to memory by the collective unconscious of the community work automatically,\u201d Maki wrote. \u201cOku, a spatial concept peculiar to Japan, is a good example, and I believe an understanding of this way of perceiving space is important in formulating ideas of what future cities should be like.\u201d Maki was the second Japanese to win the Pritzker, hailed as the Nobel Prize of architecture, after Kenzo Tange, his mentor. Maki, along with fellow Tange students\u00a0Arata Isozaki\u00a0and\u00a0Kisho Kurokawa, were the pillars of Japanese modernism. The Pritzker, in selecting Maki, praised him as part of a new wave of architects rebuilding postwar Japan. \u201cHe uses light in a masterful way making it as tangible a part of every design as are the walls and roof. In each building, he searches for a way to make transparency, translucency and opacity exist in total harmony. He uses detail to give his structures rhythm and scale,\u201d Bill Lacy, a member of the international panel of jurors that selected Maki, said at the time. Maki was honored with other awards, such as the Wolf Prize from Israel in 1988 and the Arnold Brunner Prize from the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1999. In 2011, the American Institute of Architects honored Maki with its highest accolade, the AIA Gold Medal. Japanese media reports said a memorial service was planned.

Instead, they found themselves trapped inside a grounded plane for more than three hours, according to passenger Garth Collins, who posted about his experience on Instagram. Not only that, but the passengers were stuck inside the closed metal vessel without air conditioning, Collins said, as temperatures outside soared above 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 degrees Celsius), leading to passengers \u201cliterally dehydrating and passing out on the plane.\u201d Greece has been gripped by a blistering heatwave in the past week, causing popular tourist sites like the Acropolis to be closed to the public. British television personality Michael Mosley was found dead on the Greek island of Symi after he went for a walk in high temperatures last Wednesday. This week, two other tourists also disappeared on separate hikes elsewhere in the country, authorities have said. In a video posted by Collins, passengers can be seen standing up from their seats and in the aisles of the plane, fanning themselves and fellow passengers with paper.

Speaking to CNN affiliate 7News after she arrived in Melbourne, Zeiher said she didn\u2019t understand why the passengers were allowed to board. \u2018I\u2019m a frequent flyer, I travel regularly, and I just don\u2019t understand why we were allowed to board in the first place,\u201d Zeiher said, according to 7News. \u201cNot to mention what unfolded afterwards. It was just horrendous.\u201d 7News reports that passengers took their shirts off to deal with the heat, with a few cups of water being handed out in the cabin. \u201cThe flight attendants were doing the best they could given the situation,\u201d Zeiher told 7News, adding that \u201cit seemed like they didn\u2019t know any more than we did about what was going on.\u201d Eventually, the passengers disembarked the plane. Collins says he was on the plane for around three and a half hours, while Zeiher said she was onboard for around four. Zeiher told 7News that she received \u201czero information\u201d from Qatar Airways, so she decided to rebook her onward flight to Australia through Emirates. According to flight tracking website Flightradar24, flight QR204 was supposed to leave Athens International Airport at 1:55 p.m. local time. It eventually departed at 6:44 a.m. the following morning, landing at Doha\u2019s Hamad International\u00a0Airport at 10:35 a.m. local time. Qatar Airways told CNN that, as a result of the technical issue, \u201call passengers were asked to disembark the aircraft and were supported by our staff at Athens International Airport while ground maintenance teams worked to resolve the issue.\u201d \u201cThe flight later departed from ATH, arriving in DOH at 10.39 local time on Tuesday 11 June 2024, where we extended our full support to all affected passengers upon arrival to ensure smooth onward connections to their final destination,\u201d it continued. \u201cWe regard the safety and comfort of our passengers and crew as our highest priority at all times, and have offered our apologies to each passenger affected by this unforeseen disruption and the inconvenience caused.

WAFA\u2019s report did not give any details about whether there were any casualties. The Israeli military denied carrying out any strikes on the safe zone or surrounding areas. \u201cContrary to the reports from the last few hours, the IDF did not strike in the Humanitarian Area in Al-Mawasi,\u201d the Israel Defense Forces told CNN. The latest report of a strike come as a ceasefire plan for the devastating eight-month war between Israel and Hamas stutters, with neither side yet publicly committing to the deal despite intense lobbying from American officials, including US President Joe Biden. Hamas said\u00a0in a statement\u00a0Wednesday it \u201chas shown the necessary positivity in all stages of negotiations\u201d\u00a0to reach a \u201ccomprehensive and acceptable agreement based on the just demands of our people.\u201d The statement comes after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken questioned whether the Palestinian militant group is \u201cproceeding in good faith\u201d in the ceasefire negotiations, saying Hamas had proposed a number of changes in their response to the latest deal, which \u201cgo beyond positions they had previously taken.\u201d On Wednesday, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in Rafah said it had received information from Israeli authorities that fighting will continue in western Rafah. CNN video showed many Palestinians taking down shelters and packing up their belongings after warnings spread of a pending military operation. An estimated 550,000 people are now in Al-Mawasi, according to a\u00a0report\u00a0from Oxfam, after the IDF ordered people in eastern Rafah to head to the \u201cexpanded humanitarian area\u201d as it stepped up its operations in southern Gaza. Currently just 121 toilets have been installed in the densely packed tent city, according to Oxfam, meaning every toilet is shared by more than 4,000 people. The Al-Mawasi camp was already filled with displaced people before civilians in Rafah were ordered to move there. The United Nations has called facilities in the area unsuitable for the hundreds of thousands of Gazans uprooted by violence in Rafah and across the Gaza Strip. More than 1 million people have fled Rafah to the nearby areas of Al-Mawasi, Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis in recent weeks, according to Oxfam. Some 1.7 million people, more than two thirds of Gaza\u2019s population, are now estimated to be crammed into an area of 69 square kilometers (27 square miles) \u2014 less than a fifth of the strip. The reports of strikes on Thursday follow an operation by Israel to rescue hostages held by Hamas over the weekend. The Israeli military rescued four hostages in the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, an operation that Gazan authorities said killed 274 people and injured almost 700 others. The IDF has disputed those numbers, saying it estimated the number of casualties from the operation was \u201cunder 100.\u201d CNN cannot independently verify either side\u2019s figures.

Fighters from the Rapid Support Forces (RSF)\u00a0plundered the facility on Saturday stealing an ambulance among other supplies, the aid agency said. \u201cOn Saturday, MSF and the Ministry of Health suspended all activities in South Hospital, El Fasher, North Darfur, after RSF soldiers stormed the facility, opened fire, and looted it, including stealing an MSF ambulance,\u201d MSF Sudan said on social media Saturday. The hospital was the only one in the region \u201cequipped to deal with mass casualties\u201d and \u201cwas the main referral hospital for treating war-wounded.\u201d It was also one of the two hospitals in El Fasher with surgical capacity, according to MSF. As a result, patients are being moved to Paediatric and Saudi hospitals \u201cwhich were unprepared for such an influx,\u201d it added. Video posted on an apparent RSF \u201cX\u201d account shows armed men at the front gate of South Hospital. The footage was geolocated by CNN and shows at least one man firing an AK-style weapon on hospital grounds. According to MSF\u2019s statement posted on Twitter,\u00a0only ten patients and a small medical team were at the hospital\u00a0when it was attacked. Medical teams had already begun transferring patients and services to other facilities earlier in the week after intensified fighting in the region, the MSF said. Images posted to social media and verified by CNN show damaged medical equipment strewn in and around the facility. In one video, an armed man poses inside what appears to be an ambulance parked outside South Hospital. It is unclear whether the vehicle belonged to MSF. CNN has reached out to the RSF for comment. MSF said most patients and the remaining medical team, which included all MSF staff, were able to flee the violence but they are unable to say for certain if there were any casualties due to the chaos that ensued. South Hospital is the latest medical facility to fall into warring factions\u2019 crosshairs in Darfur. The medical facility had already been hit by mortar shells and bullets multiple times in the preceding weeks between May 25th\u00a0and June 3rd\u00a0resulting in two deaths and 14 injuries among patients and caretakers, according to MSF. On May 11, nearby Babiker Nahar Paediatric Hospital was impacted by an SAF airstrike 50 meters from the facility, per an MSF press release. Two children and a care giver in the intensive care unit were killed in the strike after a roof collapsed. \u201cIt is outrageous that the RSF opened fire inside the hospital. This is not an isolated incident, as staff and patients have endured attacks on the facility for weeks from all sides, but opening fire inside a hospital crosses a line,\u201d said MSF\u2019s Head of Emergencies Michel Lacharite, as quoted by MSF Sudan on X Saturday. \u201cWarring parties must halt attacks on medical care. Hospitals are closing. Remaining facilities can\u2019t handle mass casualties. We are trying to find solutions. The responsibility is on warring parties to spare medical facilities,\u201d Lacharite added. Spokesperson for Foreign Affairs & Security Policy of the EU Nabila Massrali\u00a0said on X Sunday,\u00a0\u201cThe EU is appalled by RSF-Janjaweed assault of staff at the El Fasher South Hospital in Darfur also looting it, as it did with many other hospitals in Sudan.\u201d \u201cWe remind again the [RSF] to show restraint and respect International Humanitarian Law,\u201d she added.

Civil war in Sudan between the SAF and RSF broke out in April 2023.

{"id": "2024_04_10_style_graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers", "text": "Climbing up abandoned, unfinished floors and tightrope walking across balcony ledges, backpacks clanging with cans of alkyd and acrylic, a collective of Los Angeles graffiti artists have transformed their craft beyond urban aesthetics to champion community issues. Their choice of canvas: Oceanwide Plaza in Downtown LA. Occupying over a full square city block, the plaza was imagined as a vast mixed-use building project, offering city residents over 500 lavish condominiums, a five-star hotel, retail spaces, restaurants and a private 2-acre park. However, construction on the $1 billion project, which began in 2015, was shelved after the Chinese-backed contractor Oceanwide Holdings ran out of funding\u00a0in 2019 \u2014 and it has lain unfinished ever since. The plaza\u2019s status \u2014 and potential \u2014 as an eye-catching venue for their work spread by word of mouth within the graffiti community in recent months. Security at the site was known to be lax, an important detail as accessing the plaza\u2019s towers and other buildings constitutes trespassing. (The Los Angeles City Attorney confirmed to CNN that, as of April 3, criminal charges have been filed against 23 individuals, for violations including trespassing and possession of vandalism tools.) \u201cIt was like a gift from the graffiti gods\u2026 A giant canvas in the middle of downtown,\u201d tagger ENDEM told CNN, speaking on behalf of himself and his graffiti crew, NCT. \u201cWe were like, \u2018Let\u2019s do it right. Let\u2019s do it as if the whole world is going to see this.\u2019\u201d Historically, graffiti has often been used as protest art. While the practice dates back thousands of years, it\u2019s most commonly viewed in a contemporary context (within graffiti\u2019s \u201cmodern\u201d era, which dates back to the 1960s and 70s) as a creative vehicle for challenging societal norms and inequities \u2014 whether on the Berlin Wall in Germany or subway cars in New York City; whether painted by anonymous artists or well-known figures like Keith Haring or Banksy, even if the latter is, technically, anonymous himself. Still, neither ENDEM nor any of the other artists involved realized how famous their work on the Oceanside towers would become. Sharing his artwork on Instagram on January 31, a video from ENDEM quickly racked up tens of thousands of views: Vibrant images of bright block lettering splayed across the building\u2019s exterior paired with footage from the inside \u2014 the artist posing with shots of his spray paint cans, poised above the cityscape. The viral footage, among other visuals shared on social media, quickly opened the floodgates. Hitting Oceanside became a mark of credibility in the graffiti world; by mid-February, the number of tags and other graffiti pieces there were multiplying overnight. \u201cIt was an open house people going in and out. It was beautiful. It was like graffiti paradise,\u201d ENDEM said. \u201cIt felt exactly like the streets, but concentrated.\u201d Transformed in part into an art installation, Oceanwide became an opportunity for the graffiti artists to leave a message to the city below, and a call-out to policy makers who leave buildings to rot. \u201cGraffiti shows you where the city hurts,\u201d Roger Gastman, owner and founder of the LA-based arts organization Beyond the Streets, told CNN. Renowned for its large-scale exhibitions, immersive educational programs, pop-up events and partnerships, Beyond the Streets works to educate and celebrate the diverse dimensions of graffiti as a medium. To him, the mission of graffiti is clear: to challenge, educate, and redefine public perception of the medium. Earl Ofari Hutchinson, president of The Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable, a nonpartisan public policy forum\u00a0for civic participation and education,\u00a0sees the abandoned towers as amplifying the social issues of the community they are situated in, connecting the graffiti-laden structures to the urban blight that surrounds them in LA\u2019s Skid Row. Skid Row is a 50-block sector of downtown LA where between 8,000 and 11,000 unhoused people live in challenging, often squalid conditions. \u201cYou\u2019ve got tens of thousands of people displaced because of over urban development. And as a result of that, they\u2019re on the streets,\u201d Hutchinson told CNN, noting that the homeless population in Los Angeles is continuing to grow. (The Los Angeles Housing Services Authority reports a 9% increase in homelessness in LA county in 2023 and a 10% increase in the city from 2022.) \u201cNow, set right in the middle of that, you have\u2026 a development that will never be completed.\u201d \u201cWhat you have here is a classic urban nightmare brought on by very poor policies \u2014 fiscal, financial, budgetary and political problems (in) a city that has just gone off the rails in terms of over-development and lack of affordability,\u201d Hutchinson added. Still, Hutchinson is no fan of the graffiti either. To him, and many other LA residents who have said they disapprove of the \u201cvandalism,\u201d the plaza is a sore sight for eyes. \u201cThe problem is you\u2019re talking about violating public space and with no permission\u2026 that doesn\u2019t fly with me,\u201d Hutchinson said. \u201cThe fact of the matter is, the public has not given you approval. (And) the general public has to pay for the removal.\u201d Costs currently borne by the taxpayer at the Oceanwide Plaza site include the security details provided by the LAPD as well as the graffiti cleanup Hutchinson highlights. (\u201cThis has strained our deployment,\u201d LAPD Chief Michel Moore said during a February meeting of the Los Angeles City Council. \u201cWe have called in some officers on an overtime basis so that we can provide for these added patrols or station them at that site to deter vandals and others from gaining access.\u201d) Clean teams working in the neighborhoods surrounding Oceanwide remove on average some 2,000 square feet of graffiti per week, with that figure growing in recent months. \u201cPeople forget that people live here. People own businesses here and they don\u2019t want to have to spend the time and money to clean it up,\u201d said Blair Besten, executive director of the Historic Core of Downtown Los Angeles, an organization which works to improve the quality of life in downtown neighborhoods. The Historic Core prioritizes street sweeping, trash collection \u2014 and graffiti removal. \u201cI would hardly call what they\u2019re doing art,\u201d Besten argued of the Oceanwide taggers. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty sloppy and quick. They come in fast and they knock it out and they leave.\u201d But to Gastman, graffiti is a powerful form of expression, and a call-to-action \u2014 particularly for those who emanate from struggles within home life, gang life or societal turmoil. Graffiti culture can offer an unexpected support system for those the city has abandoned, Gastman said. It becomes a platform for them to make their voices heard. \u201cIn graffiti culture, a lot of us know each other. We\u2019re all friends. We have the same mentality \u2014 we\u2019re just trying to get up. We\u2019re just trying to get noticed,\u201d explained ENDEM. In the midst of an addiction that led to his rock bottom, graffiti became his lifeline, he explained. \u201cI was at my lowest of lows, still trying to stay sober, I needed some type of outlet,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cGraffiti is something that you can hold on to. Its bigger than me, its everyone, it\u2019s a community.\u201d In this, ENDEM believes that the beauty of Oceanwide isn\u2019t tangible. Rather, it lies in the birth of a new generation of graffiti writers. \u201cThey can erase the graffiti on buildings, but they can never erase the impact that it has on the city of Los Angeles and the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to it. Yes, it\u2019s vandalism. Yes, it\u2019s art, and it\u2019s everything in between,\u201d Gastman concluded. \u201cThis is a real culture. It\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/10/style/graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "world"}}

The Princess of Wales, her husband William, their children George, Charlotte and Louis gathered together with King Charles and Queen Camilla to watch a Royal Air Force flypast. They waved and smiled at the crowd, who responded with cheers. The Princess, also known as Kate, was earlier driven in a state carriage with her children from Buckingham Palace to Horse Guards Parade to watch the celebration, known as Trooping the Colour. She could be seen wearing an Irish Guards regimental broach, a nod towards her role as their honorary colonel. The family were later seen watching events from a viewing point, while Kate\u2019s husband William, the Prince of Wales, rode on horseback. For Kate, it was her first public appearance since Christmas Day \u2013 weeks before her cancer diagnosis. Kate stepped away from public duties in January, following what Kensington Palace said at the time was surgery for a non-cancerous abdominal condition. In March, amid speculation about her wellbeing, she revealed she had been diagnosed with cancer after the operation, and was undergoing treatment. King Charles III and Queen Camilla were also taken in a carriage from Buckingham Palace, bringing cheers from the packed crowds as they made their way slowly up The Mall. The King took part riding a carriage rather than on horseback this year due to his own cancer diagnosis. People of all ages gathered along the length of the Mall for the event. Some onlookers are wearing Union Jack bucket hats and fascinators, while others are waving flags. Some sang the national anthem. Kate gave an update on her health on Friday, saying she had made \u201cgood progress\u201d in her recovery. But she said she expected her treatment to last for a few more months and was \u201cnot out of the woods yet.\u201d Trooping the Colour is the magnificent military spectacle which sees 1,400 officers and soldiers, together with 400 musicians and 200 horses, process through the streets of London from Buckingham Palace to Horse Guard\u2019s Parade, while crowds line the route. The event - one of the highlights of the royal calendar - is a tradition marking the official birthday of the British sovereign for more than 260 years. However, Charles\u2019s actual birthday is in November. Britain\u2019s Kings and Queens have doubled up on their festivities since the 18th century, holding both a public celebration \u2013 the official birthday \u2013 and a more private event on the real date. The tradition is believed to have started with the party-mad King George II in 1748. Like Charles III, George was born in November, when British weather is often far from ideal. Proving that point, the weather took a downward turn as events neared their end. Crowds waiting for the King to arrive back at the palace were lashed with heavy rain and gusts of wind. Some onlookers struggled to hold their umbrellas in place. Speaking about Kate\u2019s appearance on the balcony, David Betteridge, 66, told CNN that \u201cshe looked well so hopefully that is a good sign.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s really nice to see her back actually,\u201d he added. \u201cFor the most part we stayed dry. But we got pretty wet just after the ceremony when the parade had finished. It rained very hard.\u201d Anna Yang, 30, who was visiting the UK from China on holiday, said she saw the flypast from her hotel nearby. \u201cIt was great. It\u2019s our first time, even in our own country, seeing all the national aircraft going through the sky,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cIt was incredible.\u201d But anti-royalists turned out too, some of whom chanted \u201cshame\u201d and \u201cnot my king!\u201d This year\u2019s proceedings were adapted as the 75-year-old Charles continues his treatment for an unspecified form of cancer. Doctors have been encouraged by his progress, allowing him to resume public-facing duties in April, but each engagement he carries out is reviewed and adapted where appropriate. For the events on Saturday, he carried out his review of troops seated in an Ascot landau carriage alongside Queen Camilla. Three of the British Army\u2019s horses which bolted across in London in April returned to duty and took part in this weekend\u2019s birthday parade. The two remaining horses \u201care enjoying a summer holiday in the Chilterns\u201d and will return to service in due course, according to the army.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/15/uk/trooping-the-colour-princess-kate-intl-scli-gbr/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "world"}}

All six of the dead are Jordanian citizens, the Jordanian foreign ministry said Saturday, adding that it was coordinating with Saudi authorities in Jeddah regarding burial procedures and possible transfer of their bodies back to Jordan. News of the deaths comes as pilgrims gathered atop Mount Arafat on Saturday, marking the main event of the pilgrimage, with the niece of one of the deceased telling CNN Arabic that her aunt had died on Mount Arafat and was buried in Saudi Arabia. More than\u00a01.8 million people\u00a0are taking part in Hajj this year, according to the Saudi General Authority for Statistics. The Hajj is one of the biggest religious gatherings in the world and the largest annual event in Saudi Arabia. It occurs two months and 10 days after Ramadan ends, during the Islamic month of Dhul-Hijjah. Because the Islamic calendar is lunar and shorter than the Gregorian calendar, the timing of Hajj on the Gregorian calendar shifts slightly each year. This year, Saudi Arabia is expected to experience extreme heat over the five-day pilgrimage, with temperatures reaching 48 degrees Celsius (118 degrees Fahrenheit) in Mecca. Hajj officials are asking pilgrims to carry umbrellas and stay hydrated amid the harsh conditions, the spokesman for the ministry of health Muhammad Al-Abdulaali said, according to the state news agency SPA. The Saudi army has also deployed more than 1,600 personnel with medical units specifically for heatstroke and 30 rapid response teams. Another 5,000 health and first aid volunteers are taking part. Jordan has previously said there were more than 4,000 pilgrims in its official delegation this year. However, the foreign ministry clarified that the six who died were not part of the \u201cofficial delegation,\u201d meaning they did not have valid Hajj licenses to perform the pilgrimage. Performing Hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam. Islam requires every Muslim who is physically and financially able to make the journey to the holy city of Mecca at least once in his or her life. The pilgrimage includes numerous detailed rituals including wearing a special garment that symbolizes human equality and unity before God, a circular, counter-clockwise procession around the Kaaba, and the symbolic stoning of evil. People who have completed the pilgrimage may add the phrase al-Hajj or hajji (pilgrim) to their names. Over the past decade, Saudi Arabia has invested billions of dollars to upgrade transport, technology and accommodation for pilgrims performing Hajj \u2013 a key source of income for the world\u2019s largest oil producer.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/15/middleeast/hajj-pilgrims-die-heatstroke-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "world"}}

As well as withdrawing from the four occupied regions in eastern and southern Ukraine, Putin said Ukraine must demilitarize and that Western countries must lift their sanctions on Russia, which have damaged but not crippled its economy. While these conditions are more maximalist than those Putin has hinted at before, they represent Russia\u2019s failure to achieve its original war aims, when Moscow believed it could capture Kyiv in days and the rest of Ukraine in weeks. Nearly 28 months later, Russia occupies around a fifth of Ukrainian territory, including the Crimean peninsula it annexed a decade ago. Ukrainian and certain Western officials have repeatedly warned that Putin intends to settle for nothing less than Kyiv\u2019s total defeat, and that any truce or peace talks are merely a guise to allow Russia\u2019s troops to regroup and launch a fresh and fiercer offensive in the future. But, in comments to the foreign ministry, Putin said Russia\u2019s conditions for peace talks are \u201csimple,\u201d beginning with the total withdrawal of Ukraine\u2019s troops from the entire territory of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. Moscow only controls these regions partially, but claimed the whole of each region was part of Russia\u2019s territory in 2022. Putin stressed that Ukraine should surrender not just the territory on the Russian side of the frontline, which splices through each of these regions, but \u201cthe entire territory of these regions.\u201d \u201cAs soon as they declare in Kyiv that they are ready for such a decision and begin the real withdrawal of troops from these regions \u2013 and also officially notify about the abandonment of plans to join NATO \u2013 our side will immediately, at the same minute, make the order to cease fire and begin negotiations,\u201d he said. Putin promised to \u201cguarantee the unhindered and safe withdrawal of Ukrainian units and formations,\u201d and said Moscow acknowledges its role in global stability. He asked that his terms for ending the war would need to be cemented in international agreements. But Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said his country \u201cdoes not trust\u201d Putin\u2019s \u201cultimatum,\u201d which he said did not significantly differ from previous offers he has made before. Speaking Friday from the Group of Seven summit in Italy, Zelensky drew parallels between Putin\u2019s tactics and those used by Nazi leader Adolf Hitler to conquer swaths of Europe in the 1930s and 40s. \u201cHe talks about regions of our country, and he says he will not stop,\u201d Zelensky told CNN affiliate Sky Tg24. \u201cIt\u2019s the same thing Hitler did, when he said \u2018give me a part of Czechoslovakia and that\u2019s the end of it.\u2019 You can\u2019t trust it,\u201d Zelensky said, referring to Hitler\u2019s annexation of the Sudetenland and Western countries\u2019 failed policy of appeasement. \u201cThat is why we must not trust these messages, because Putin follows the same course,\u201d Zelensky warned. Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak called on Kyiv\u2019s allies to \u201cget rid of illusions\u201d and to stop taking Russia\u2019s proposals seriously, describing Putin\u2019s terms as \u201coffensive to common sense.\u201d \u201cThere is no novelty in this, no real peace proposals and no desire to end the war. But there is a desire not to pay for this war and to continue it in new formats. It\u2019s all a complete sham,\u201d Podolyak said. Putin\u2019s speech comes on the eve of the Swiss peace conference, in which nearly 100 countries and organizations will take part. He dismissed the conference as \u201canother ploy to divert everyone\u2019s attention.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/europe/putin-conditions-peace-talks-ukraine-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_15_style_my-america-diana-matar-police-shootings", "text": "In 2015 alone, 1,146 people died during or after interactions with law enforcement officials in the US. In 2016, the death toll was 1,093, per \u201cThe Counted,\u201d a special report and database from The Guardian. (In both years, the vast majority of deaths were classified as due to gunshot wounds, with a small number of fatalities after individuals were tased, struck by police vehicles or reported as a \u201cdeath in custody.\u201d) For the photographer Diana Matar, seeking to memorialize these deaths \u2014 and the liminal spaces they represent \u2014 proved overwhelming to consider as a project, even at a smaller scale. She narrowed her focus down to four states; California and Texas, because they had the highest number of such incidents across the country, and Oklahoma and New Mexico because they consistently had some of the highest rates per capita. \u201cI thought I could photograph (where) every encounter happened in two years in these four states, and it just became impossible,\u201d Matar told CNN. \u201cTimewise, financially, in every possible way.\u201d Still, over some three years of photography trips, Matar drove hundreds of miles across the four states, visiting more than 300 locations where people had died during (or following) an encounter with law enforcement officers in 2015 and 2016. 110 of these images are published now in the monograph \u201cMy America;\u201d quiet, monochromatic images of everyday sites like parking lots, rural roads and suburban sidewalks. Patches of grass at an empty roadside mark the place where 40-year-old Terence Crutcher was killed by a police officer in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in 2016. In Addison, Texas, birds perching on telephone wires overlook the site where 16-year-old Jose Cruz was murdered by an off duty police officer that same year. (In 2018, the officer was sentenced to 10 years in prison, having been found guilty of murder and aggravated assault.) Two chairs on a sunny sidewalk in Los Angeles, California, indicate where 37-year-old Norma Guzman, 37, was shot and killed by police officers in 2015. Beside each image in the book are three brief lines of biographical information: the name of the deceased, their birth and death years, and the site\u2019s location. \u201cI was really adamant about how the photographs would be presented. I just wanted it to be a name,\u201d said Matar, who consulted family and victims\u2019 support groups. \u201cI didn\u2019t want the last thing to be thought of about these people was the way they died. These were people, with lives.\u201d \u201cThere are so many images, and so many images of violence that we kind of turn off,\u201d Matar added continued of today\u2019s era of social media and smartphones. \u201cI think we need space to digest, and I wanted to approach this in a way that was quite quiet. I wanted images that did not reinforce the violence. I wanted images that you can look at, and imagine this very banal place as the last place someone has been.\u201d An internationally acclaimed photographer and distinguished artist at Columbia University\u2019s Barnard College in New York City, Matar\u2019s relationship with documenting landscapes and violence is rooted in her own personal experiences. In 1990, her father-in-law was forcibly disappeared by the Gadhafi regime in Libya, and was never seen by his family again. \u201cI was familiar with this idea of the legacy of state-sponsored violence and what it does intimately to a family\u2026 but also really looking at it through photography and what these landscapes hold,\u201d Matar said. Matar was born in California but has lived abroad for nearly two decades. Her photographic practice has taken her to locations across Libya, North Africa, Italy and Ukraine looking at the intersections of landscape and memory, in particular examining spaces where people had been killed or forcibly interned. But before beginning her work on \u201cMy America,\u201d she had never turned her lens on the US. In 2014 and 2015, the police killings of Black men and boys including Eric Garner in New York City, 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, 12-year-old Tamir Rice in Cleveland, Ohio and Walter Scott in Charleston, South Carolina, captured on camera and shared on social media, sparked national protests and a racial reckoning. Matar felt compelled to return to America. \u201cI had worked on issues around landscapes of violence and state violence for many years outside of my home country, and I wanted to start researching what was happening from that point of view (in the US).\u201d Using a range of sources \u2014 including victim databases, media coverage, district attorney documents and police reports \u2014 Matar made her work during six lengthy road trips. She would watch videos or local news coverage of what happened at the location right before photographing the site in question. \u201cThat really was very emotionally affecting,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery time I got out of the car, I was very aware I was not just taking a photograph of a landscape or of a building. I was photographing something that held the last moments of someone\u2019s life \u2014 unless they had been taken to hospital, it was the place where these deaths happened. It made me think about my country, and made me question so many things. \u201d Of all the sites Matar visited, she said only seven had a memorial of some kind, whether that was a mural, flowers, memorabilia or photos. In a way, though, the photographs and the information placed alongside them in \u201cMy America\u201d have a memorial-like quality of their own; Matar emphasizes this was a conscious decision in the book\u2019s design. \u201cI wanted a lot of white space in there, because I wanted the viewer to sit and think, and not just move on quickly,\u201d she said. While the biographical information next to each photograph is sparse, Matar researched and wrote a longer passage of text dedicated to each person\u2019s life, and death, which is included in the book\u2019s final pages. She describes her research of the wider issues relating to law-enforcement related deaths as \u201ceven more affecting\u201d than the process of making the photographs. This is exemplified in a series of pages in the middle of the book which outline key statistics related to such deaths, those impacted and factors involved \u2014 like that the number of people who die in encounters with police each year (around 1,000) has not changed in the nine years since Matar started researching the project in 2015. \u201cWhen you see all the things that go into why this is occurring \u2014 the lack of mental health beds, the lack of arms training, the racial injustice \u2014 there\u2019s so many things that come together in this particular challenge,\u201d Matar reflected. \u201cThis book is placing this type of violence in a continuum of a lot of violence in the history of the country.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t have an illusion that this work is going to change anything, she continued. \u201cWhat I do think, though, is that point a camera at something, researching something, writing about something \u2014 all these things require great attention. And that attention is saying that this matters, this really matters.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/15/style/my-america-diana-matar-police-shootings/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_10_europe_ukraine-drone-strike-destroys-russian-su57-stealth-fighter-intl-hnk-ml", "text": "Ukraine\u2019s military on Sunday said it had destroyed one of Russia\u2019s newest and most advanced fighter jets in a drone strike on a military base deep inside Russia. The Sukhoi Su-57 fighter, nicknamed the \u201cFelon\u201d by NATO, was struck on the tarmac of an airbase in the Astrakhan region, almost 600 kilometers (372 miles) behind the front lines of fighting in Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, according to Ukraine\u2019s defense intelligence agency (GUR). The agency posted satellite pictures in a post on its Telegram channel to support its claim, writing, \u201cThe images show that on June 7, Su-57 was still intact, but on June 8, craters from the explosion and distinctive fire spots emerged near it as a result of the fire damage.\u201d The Su-57 is a supersonic, twin-engine, fifth-generation stealth fighter jet and was seen as Moscow\u2019s answer to Western stealth jets like the US Air Force\u2019s F-22 Raptor. But its development, which began in 2002, according to the US military, has been slow, and an Su-57 crashed during a 2019 test flight. The Russian military received its first Su-57 in 2020, according to a report by the state-run TASS news agency, which said the jet was earlier \u201ctested\u201d in combat conditions in Syria in 2018. The Ukrainian Telegram post noted the Su-57\u2019s ability to carry Kh-59 and Kh-69 cruise missiles, which the jet could launch against Ukraine from the safety of Russian airspace. While experts have expressed doubts on the Su-57\u2019s capabilities compared to the F-22, Russian officials have praised its role in attacks on Ukraine. In a 2022 TASS report, then Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu said the Su-57 \u201chas shown itself brilliantly.\u201d \u201cThe aircraft has a very high degree of protection against various air defense systems, has protection against missiles \u2026 Most importantly, it has very powerful weapons. We also tried and tested these weapons, they work brilliantly,\u201d Shoigu said at the time. The exact number of combat-ready Su-57s available to Russia\u2019s air force is unclear. Flight Global\u2019s \u201cWorld Air Forces 2024\u201d directory lists 14 Su-57s as active and another 62 as on order. \u201cThe Russian Aerospace Forces currently have only a limited number of these combat aircraft in service,\u201d the GUR Telegram post said. TASS reported in 2022 that Russian forces will receive a total of 22 Su-57s by the end of this year. If the reports of the Ukrainian drone strike deep inside Russia prove true, it marks another success of Kyiv\u2019s low-cost drones taking out high-value Russian assets. The price of an Su-57 is estimated to be $35 million to $54 million, according to the Foreign Policy Research Institute. Drone strikes have become an increasing problem for Moscow. Other Ukrainian drones have been used to sink or severely damage Russian warships in the Black Sea, and tanks and armored vehicles have fallen prey to drones on the battlefield. The attack would also bring new worries for Russia in protecting bases far back from the battlefield. \u201cThis is a really a trend that the Russians are worried about,\u201d said CNN contributor Jill Dougherty, the network\u2019s former Moscow bureau chief. \u201cThe Ukrainians are attacking more and more inside Russia and taking the battle to them,\u201d Dougherty said. After reports of the strike surfaced, Russian military bloggers criticized the military for not building hangars to protect the Su-57s, noting that protective hangars could be constructed at every air base for the price of one Su-57, according to the Institute for the Study of War.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/europe/ukraine-drone-strike-destroys-russian-su57-stealth-fighter-intl-hnk-ml/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_15_europe_germany-first-veterans-day-intl", "text": "Germany is marking its first Veterans\u2019 Day since World War Two on Saturday,\u00a0a once unthinkable move that\u00a0sets\u00a0aside long-standing unease over the honoring of its soldiers. In a sign of the \u201cZeitenwende,\u201d or \u201cchanging of the times,\u201d that Germany is\u00a0undergoing in the wake of the Ukraine war, the country is actively seeking to increase the prestige of its military. Germany has for decades felt uncomfortable over such pageantry given the role of its soldiers in World War II and the Holocaust. But a\u00a0bill to introduce an annual national Veterans\u2019 Day was voted in on April 25 after being approved by nearly all parties in the German parliament. Only the far-left Die Linke party raised objections.\u00a0Party co-chairman Ates G\u00fcrpinar implied this was due to the party\u2019s pacifist stance. \u201cWe on the left reject this Veterans\u2019 Day,\u201d\u00a0he told CNN in a statement.\u00a0\u201cIt is based on cheap symbolic politics and at the same time ensures the minister of defense\u2019s promise of war-readiness.\u201d\u00a0 The new legislation states that the day should be celebrated \u201cpublicly and visibly\u201d every year on June 15.\u00a0It\u00a0also\u00a0mandates improvements to services providing mental and physical care for veterans, including rehabilitation and therapy. The commemorations, modeled on Armed Forces Day in the UK and Veterans Day in the US, will honor all Germans who have worn military uniform \u2013 not only those wounded or killed in combat.\u00a0Germany has around 10 million veterans, according to its ministry of defense.\u00a0 Defense Minister Boris Pistorius described the move as a \u201cstrong, important and, yes, an overdue signal of recognition and appreciation.\u201d During the Cold War, Soviet-occupied East Germany celebrated its National People\u2019s Army with military parades. An equivalent was never established in the West. Following the end of World War II,\u00a0the first combat mission in which\u00a0German soldiers took part was the Kosovo War in the late 1990s.\u00a0Since then\u00a0the most significant deployments of\u00a0the\u00a0German armed forces, or Bundeswehr,\u00a0have been in Afghanistan and Mali. But the biggest spur to creating a Veterans\u2019\u00a0Day has been Ukraine. Germany was initially reluctant to send heavy weaponry to Kyiv for fear of becoming directly involved in the war, but eventually bowed to international pressure. Now, Berlin is the second-biggest supplier of military aid to Ukraine. \u201cThe war against Ukraine has created the need for a significant build-up of the Bundeswehr (armed forces), increased spending and also recruitment,\u201d Johannes Kiess, a sociologist at the University of Leipzig, told CNN.\u00a0It was\u00a0an opportunity, he\u00a0added,\u00a0that made it appear appropriate to upgrade the military \u201csymbolically\u201d as well. A relationship of respect This Saturday, the day will be marked with an event in Berlin. From next year, commemorations will take place nationwide. Johannes Arlt, a former soldier who was deployed four times to Afghanistan and three times to Mali from 2014 to 2019, is now a lawmaker for the ruling center-left Social Democrats (SPD). He played a prominent role in forming the new Veterans\u2019\u00a0Day bill. Speaking to CNN, Arlt said he\u00a0experienced first-hand the lack of recognition of the Bundeswehr in German society, particularly for deployments abroad, but acknowledged that this appears to have changed in recent times. \u201cFor a long time, there appeared to be a sparse interest in people who served abroad, and there used to be little empathy, but we find that the population now has a great deal of respect for the Bundeswehr.\u201d Arlt explains he believes a Veterans\u2019\u00a0Day in Germany is important to \u201ccommemorate military service \u2013 in all its facets \u2013 and thank the men and women who are committed to security in our country.\u201d Arlt said he experienced horrors during his military service abroad that he would not wish anyone to witness. \u201cI had my worst experiences in Mali in 2019,\u201d he said. \u201cI flew a drone and saw all the things that others didn\u2019t see on the front line. I was also present at massacres and had to watch these things and couldn\u2019t do anything. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t wish that on anyone.\u201d Mental health support leaves \u2018room for improvement\u2019 Part of the reason for the move is to improve the health services offered to soldiers returning from assignments overseas, as well as\u00a0to\u00a0raise awareness of what they have to endure. Army veteran Andreas Eggert served in the Bundeswehr from 1999-2013, first in Kosovo and then in Afghanistan. He was diagnosed with PTSD in 2013 and went into rehabilitation in 2014. He is welcoming the efforts to improve aftercare for soldiers, many of whom are left with physical or psychological damage. \u201cMental illness was still frowned upon in my time, especially if you were in a specialized assignment like I was, it was difficult to deal with it openly,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cBut I did it back then, in 2013, I spoke out it openly and was criticized a lot for it.\u201d Eggert says that he has seen the Bundeswehr\u2019s rehabilitation programs improve over the years, but there is still work to be done. \u201c[The programs] are not optimal, and the care is not optimal either. There are not enough therapists, especially not in the Bundeswehr. The Bundeswehr hospitals that do a good job are often overstretched\u2026 There is a lot of room for improvement.\u201d Regardless of the debate around marking Veterans\u2019 Day,\u00a0it is clear the country has had to adapt its anti-militaristic stance in recent years. Pistorius has previously warned that Germany needs to prepare for a worst-case scenario regarding the specter\u00a0of war in Europe. He has also not ruled out introducing some form of military conscription. For now, though, the soldiers CNN spoke to were simply grateful for the acknowledgment. \u201cI don\u2019t see myself as a hero, quite the opposite, but what I have missed is a time or even a day when we can also remember those who have fallen during their assignments,\u201d\u00a0said 42-year-old Stefan Huss, an active soldier who twice served in Afghanistan. He added: \u201cWe have been fighting for this for a long time.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/15/europe/germany-first-veterans-day-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_middleeast_israel-catapult-trebuchet-lebanon-intl", "text": "Israeli troops have used a medieval-style catapult to toss fireballs across the border into Lebanon, as fighting ramps up between Israel and the Iran-backed Islamist group Hezbollah. The trebuchet, a rotating arm with a sling attached to launch a projectile, has rarely been used since the 16th century. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the catapult was \u201ca local initiative\u201d and had not \u201ccome into widespread use,\u201d Israeli public broadcaster and CNN affiliate Kan reported Thursday. Kan said the trebuchet was probably used to burn shrubbery, making it easier for Israeli forces to identify militants attempting to reach the border. CNN has asked the IDF for comment. A video of the catapult in action was posted on social media on Wednesday. CNN could not verify when the footage was filmed but geolocated it to the Israeli-Lebanese border. While there have been reports of catapults being used by Ukrainian demonstrators during the Euromaidan protests in 2014, and by Syrian rebels in 2013, the weapon is a relic of bygone military ages. One of the last recorded uses of a large-scale trebuchet in warfare was by the Spanish conquistador Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s against the Aztecs during the assault on Tenochtitl\u00e1n, Mexico in 1521, according to the Encyclopedia Britannica. The use of trebuchets and other catapults began to dwindle after the invention of modern gunpowder artillery in the 15th century. The video comes after cross-border attacks from Lebanon led to large fires blazing through the north of Israel last week, consuming swaths of land and leading to the evacuation of residents. Cross-border attacks have spiked this month, but there has been low-intensity fighting since the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, when militants killed around 1,200 people and abducted 200 others, according to Israeli officials. That prompted Israel to go to war with Hamas in Gaza, during which it has leveled much of the Strip and killed more than 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gazan officials. Hezbollah has said its current round of fighting with Israel is to support the Palestinians in Gaza. Its military capability is believed to be far greater than that of Hamas and has grown since 2006, when it relied largely on inaccurate Soviet-era Katyusha rockets. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah says his group boasts more than 100,000 fighters and reservists. The group is also believed to possess 150,000 rockets, which could overwhelm Israel\u2019s defenses if an all-out war broke out. More than 53,000 Israelis have been evacuated from the north since hostilities began in October, the IDF told CNN. In Lebanon, more than 94,000 people have been displaced from the border area, according to the country\u2019s health ministry.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/middleeast/israel-catapult-trebuchet-lebanon-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_10_asia_china-4-us-cornell-college-instructors-attacked", "text": "A suspect has been arrested in the stabbing of four US college instructors in a public park in the city of Jilin in northeastern China, police said Tuesday. Authorities identified the suspect only by his last name, Cui, who was describes as a 55-year-old man from the city\u2019s Longtan District. Police said he \u201ccollided with a foreigner while walking\u201d in Beishan Park, a popular green space\u00a0in the city center. The suspect then stabbed the instructors, as well as a Chinese tourist who stepped forward and tried to stop him during the incident, police said in a statement. Police said they received the call around 11:49 a.m. local time Monday, after which they dispatched officers to the scene and transported the injured to the hospital for treatment. The injured \u201chave all received proper medical treatment and are not in danger \u2026\u201d police said earlier. The educators from Cornell College, a private liberal arts college\u00a0in Mount Vernon, Iowa, were wounded \u201cin a serious incident\u201d\u00a0on Monday, while participating in a partnership program with Beihua University in Jilin, according to the college. \u201cWe have been in contact with all four instructors and are assisting them during this time,\u201d Cornell College President Jonathan Brand said in a statement, adding no students took part in the program. Footage purportedly showing the aftermath of the daylight attack emerged on Chinese social media on Monday but was swiftly censored. It showed two men and a woman lying on the ground covered in large blood stains, surrounded by onlookers. They appeared conscious and were talking on their cell phones, the video showed. CNN geolocated the video to Beishan Park, a popular green space\u00a0in Jilin city center, less than half an hour\u2019s drive from Beihua University. Monday was a public holiday in China. China\u2019s Foreign Ministry confirmed Tuesday that \u201cfour foreign teachers at Beihua University were attacked\u201d while visiting the park Monday morning \u2013 adding they were immediately taken to the hospital and did not suffer life-threatening injuries. Iowa state Rep. Adam Zabner told CNN his brother, David Zabner, was one of the victims of the stabbing. Zabner said his brother, who was on his second visit to China with Cornell, is \u201cdoing well\u201d and has \u201cbeen stitched up and seems to be recovering,\u201d after speaking to him on Tuesday morning Beijing time. The other three victims survived the attack, Adam Zabner said, adding he could not comment on their health status. \u201cI\u2019m just extremely grateful that my brother is OK and that he survived this attack,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cThe hope of my family is to get my brother back home as soon as possible and get them healthy. And we really just want to thank the US State Department for all their help, and also our federal delegation from Iowa who have been particularly helpful.\u201d The US State Department said it was aware of reports of a stabbing incident in China and is monitoring the situation. \u2018Horrifying attack\u2019 Knife attacks are not uncommon in China, where guns are tightly controlled. The country has faced a spate of stabbing rampages in public places including schools and hospitals. But public attacks against foreigners are rare. The attack in Jilin comes as China has been seeking to draw back international visitors following three years of stringent Covid-19 border controls. It also comes amid efforts to boost educational exchanges with the United States as the two countries look to stabilize their fraught relationship. The incident has drawn attention and concern in Iowa from officials and lawmakers. Gov. Kim Reynolds called it a \u201chorrifying attack.\u201d US Rep. Ashley Hinson, who represents the district where Cornell College is located, said the college employees \u201cwere brutally stabbed\u201d and vowed to \u201cdo everything in our power to bring these Iowans home safely.\u201d On China\u2019s heavily censored social media, visuals and discussions about the attack had been swiftly erased since Monday. Censorship appeared to have relaxed somewhat by noon Tuesday to allow some comments to surface. Some Chinese internet users called it a \u201cterrible\u201d incident, while others questioned why Chinese media was not reporting on the attack. Some also expressed concerns about its potential impact on China\u2019s global image and the willingness of foreigners to visit the country, amid a rise in nationalism and anti-American sentiment. At its news conference Tuesday, China\u2019s Foreign Ministry sought to dismiss concerns that the attack would affect educational exchanges between China and the US. \u201cCarrying out people-to-people and cultural exchanges between China and the United States is in the common interests of both sides and has received active support and response from various sectors in both countries,\u201d said Lin, the spokesperson. \u201cChina is widely recognized as one of the safest countries in the world. China has always taken effective measures and will continue to take relevant measures to effectively protect the safety of all foreigners in China.\u201d Study ties Cornell College began a partnership with Beihua University in 2018, which would see the Chinese institution provide funding for educators from the Iowa school to travel and live in China and teach a portion of a course in areas of computer science, math and physics over two-week periods, according to information posted on the college website at the time. China has been trying to boost its educational cooperation with the US, which has suffered considerable setbacks due to the Covid pandemic and bilateral tensions. During a visit to the US in November, Chinese leader Xi Jinping announced the country would invite 50,000 young Americans to China on exchange and study programs in the next five years to foster personal ties between the two countries. The Chinese leader noted his own enduring ties to the state of Iowa in his announcement. Xi stayed with a host family in Iowa during his first visit to the US nearly four decades ago, an experience he has described as \u201cunforgettable.\u201d Last week, Xi encouraged universities in China and the US to \u201cstrengthen exchanges and cooperation,\u201d in a letter to the president of Kean University in New Jersey, which has a China-based joint venture with Wenzhou University, according to state media. China has one of the lowest rates of violent crime in the world, partly due to its strict gun controls and powerful mass surveillance. But it has continued to face mass stabbings in public places. In May, two people were killed and another 21 injured in a knife attack in a hospital in the southwestern province of Yunnan. Last year, six people were killed and one injured in an early morning\u00a0stabbing incident\u00a0outside a kindergarten in southern Guangdong province. And a\u00a02022 stabbing, also at a kindergarten, killed three and injured six in eastern Jiangxi province. Correction: An earlier version of this story reported the wrong day for the stabbings.

{"id": "2024_06_14_style_hot-rodent-men-celebrities", "text": "In the Chinese zodiac, 2024 is the year of the dragon. To the internet, it is the year of the rat. It began, seemingly, with a few innocuous social media posts comparing Mike Faist, co-star of the titillating tennis throuple film \u201cChallengers,\u201d to a dormouse. Soon, the complexity of the analogy snowballed to odd levels of specificity: He\u2019s a field mouse. No, he\u2019s a cartoon mouse. No, he\u2019s Despereaux (the dumbo-eared mouse from the 2008 animated film \u201cThe Tale of Despereaux\u201d). No, he\u2019s Stuart Little, if Stuart Little was hot. He was \u201clike if a sleepy cartoon mouse came to life and then got really into cross fit,\u201d wrote journalist Lucy Ford on X. And it wasn\u2019t long until fans on social media began examining the facial features of other male celebrities for similar signs of rodent likeness \u2014 Faist\u2019s \u201cChallengers\u201d co-star Josh O\u2019Connor, for example. Barry Keoghan. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet. Jeremy Allen White. Glen Powell. This list goes on. From chinchillas to capybaras,\u00a0the rodent comparisons sped across social media like a runaway wheel of cheese, warping the image (and perhaps the confidence) of many popular, young white male celebrities in its path. On June 2, a Daily Mail article introduced this internet in-joke to the masses. \u201cHow \u2018hot rodent\u2019 men became Hollywood\u2019s sexiest heartthrobs: Gen Z fans are going wild for actors with unusual features including Barry Keoghan, Kieran Culkin and Jeremy Allen White,\u201d read the headline. The trend has since been covered by the New York Times, the Guardian, the London Times, NBC and the Today Show, among others. How do these men \u2014 heartthrobs of the moment, even \u2014 feel about being categorized as \u201chot rodents\u201d? Powell, who was first likened to a rodent back in 2023, has gamely praised the ingenuity of the chronically online. \u201cThis is why the internet\u2019s a great place,\u201d he told Jimmy Fallon last December. \u201cI really kind of own the capybara thing now. I am the capybara.\u201d Despite outreach, CNN did not receive a response from O\u2019Connor, Chalamet, Keoghan or White. (Faist\u2019s agent, meanwhile, confirmed that the actor does not use social media. A small mercy). But more broadly, the informal sampling of average Joes \u2014 or should that be average Jerrys? \u2014 CNN reached for comment largely didn\u2019t mind being dubbed ratty. Surveyed in a Whatsapp friend group, one 20-something admitted hearing the term would \u201churt,\u201d while another said he would be happy to embrace \u201chot rat summer.\u201d A third man polled shared\u00a0that despite an initial knee jerk reaction, he understood that \u201crodent men are very hot right now\u201d and so would probably be \u201cflattered.\u201d For some, the question goes beyond the hypothetical. One had already been called a \u201crat boy\u201d by his current girlfriend. \u201cShe\u2019s still with me,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSo I\u2019ve taken it well.\u201d Similarly, Gustav, a 22-year-old X user, has also been compared to a mouse. (Stuart Little, to be precise \u2014 just like Faist.) \u201cI\u2019d say I mostly found the comment amusing,\u201d he told CNN via X. \u201cIt was clearly not meant as an insult and even though some people would take it as an insult, I mostly felt it was a way of saying that I was cute.\u201d While by no means exhaustive, these responses suggest men feel mostly fine with the \u201chot rodent\u201d trend. But if any male celebrity is struggling with the break-neck transition from traditional dreamboat to furry pin-up, perhaps the Chinese zodiac \u2014 which believes rats to be among the most intelligent, popular and charming animals of the 12-year cycle \u2014 can be some comfort, after all.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/style/hot-rodent-men-celebrities/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_uk_king-charles-foundation-awards-intl-scli-gbr", "text": "King Charles III was in his element this week as he celebrated a very special moment for his foundation at St. James\u2019s Palace in London. On Tuesday, the 75-year-old monarch attended the inaugural awards of his King\u2019s Foundation, so we thought, why not take our Royal News readers along with us? Now, to rewind for just a moment \u2013 King Charles set up the charity back in 1990 when he was still the Prince of Wales. His vision was to help revitalize communities while creating a balance between people and the planet. More than 30 years on, the King\u2019s ethos continues to drive the organization\u2019s projects, whether it\u2019s through its education courses focusing on arts, architecture, traditional crafts or rural skills, its health and wellbeing programs, or its regeneration work. King\u2019s Foundation chief executive Kristina Murrin told CNN that the charity is underpinned by the monarch\u2019s philosophy of working in concert with nature to \u201cbuild sustainable thriving communities.\u201d \u201cThe way we do that is we take our inspiration from nature and from tradition to try and work out what are the best ways we can work with nature, not against her.\u201d Murrin said the foundation has six historic sites in the United Kingdom \u2013 including Dumfries House and Highgrove Gardens \u2013 which together attracted nearly 300,000 visitors in the past 12 months, as well as more than a dozen sites internationally. Meanwhile, its education, skills and training programs benefited more than 15,000 students last year. This week\u2019s glittering event \u2013 set to become an annual fixture in the charity\u2019s calendar \u2013 saw rock royalty Rod Stewart and his wife, Penny Lancaster, footballing legend David Beckham, actress Sienna Miller, fashion editor Edward Enninful, supermodel Naomi Campbell and chef Raymond Blanc hand out awards. Organizers are eager to offer a platform to recognize students, teachers, alumni and partners for their contributions to the organization\u2019s efforts across a range of sectors. \u201cWe\u2019re really excited about the awards. The charity has been going (for) nearly 35 years and it just felt the right moment to finally celebrate the work we\u2019ve been doing,\u201d Murrin said. \u201cWe have amazing students and teachers \u2013 many of whom have gone (on) to start incredible businesses \u2013 and so it just felt it was about time we got around to celebrating some of those people.\u201d Nine awards were given out, with Charles presenting the final accolade, the King Charles III Harmony Award, to South Korean diplomat and former secretary-general of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon. In a short speech, the King said the award was \u201ccreated to recognize the individuals who champion the values which underpin the King\u2019s Foundation\u2019s mission, and my own hope, for a world in which we live in harmony with nature.\u201d He then paid tribute to the former UN chief for his \u201ctireless dedication to promoting these ideals on the global stage.\u201d Some 250 guests attended the event at St. James\u2019s Palace. Pipers from the National Piping Centre and the Rock Choir played as nominees and their families made their way up the Grand Staircase to the lavish State Apartment for the reception. The awards also featured live demonstrations of some of the foundation\u2019s educational programs, including furniture-making, woodworking and embroidery. Charles was beaming as he made his way around the reception, keen to hear about how students have been supported in learning and entrepreneurship across traditional arts, textiles, rural skills, and health and wellbeing. British gardener and broadcaster Alan Titchmarsh spoke of his joy at being involved in the foundation for several decades, saying \u201cthe fact that it works\u201d continues to draw him in. He said he wants to be involved in the King\u2019s Foundation because of \u201cthe fact that it encourages practical skills \u2013 crafts, arts \u2013 that it catches people that might otherwise fall through the net and that it really makes a difference.\u201d \u201cIt makes a difference to our landscape, to the crafts and skills that are available, making sure they don\u2019t disappear, but also to individuals. It turns people around, people who are not necessarily academic but people who have really valuable skills,\u201d he added. Among the winners was Isabelle Pennington-Edmead, 27, who received the Young Entrepreneur Award from actress Sienna Miller. After graduating from the King\u2019s Foundation\u2019s The Modern Artisan program, she has gone on to set up her own eponymous label centered on a sustainable and ethical approach. Her collection \u2013 which is inspired by her mixed Caribbean Kittitian and English heritage \u2013 is made to order, cutting out unwanted stock. She will be expanding onto an online retailer this summer while scaling up her business sustainably. She told CNN that setting up her business \u201cwas something I\u2019d always wanted to do and when I left the King\u2019s Foundation, I felt that I had the tools to be able to do it.\u201d In the Throne Room, Charles had the chance to catch up with Beckham, who was recently announced as a new ambassador for the foundation and who mentioned at the event that he had cuts on his hands from planting roses over the weekend. The pair appeared delighted to see each other again, discussing the England men\u2019s soccer team\u2019s prospects ahead of the Euro 2024 tournament, which kicks off today in Germany. Beckham assured the King \u201cwe\u2019ll be ready\u201d after a recent loss to Iceland in a friendly. Charles may have only recently returned to public duties and is continuing his cancer treatment, but that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s slowed down. Murrin told CNN that King\u2019s Foundation staff had wondered how much time Charles would have to devote himself to the charity after his accession to the throne \u201cbut he stays very involved, very committed.\u201d \u201cHis Majesty is very involved and we\u2019re incredibly lucky to have him as our Royal Founding President. He was bringing attention to some of these themes around the climate, the planet, and our sustainability decades ago. It\u2019s a real honor to do his work.\u201d She added: \u201cHe loves seeing the projects that we\u2019re making out in the world \u2013 both here and across the globe.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/uk/king-charles-foundation-awards-intl-scli-gbr/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "world"}}

The aircraft went missing after it failed to land at the Mzuzu International Airport, about 380 km (240 miles) to the north of the capital Lilongwe. The wreckage of the plane has been located, Chakwera said in an address to the nation. \u201cThe search and rescue operation I ordered to find the missing plane that carried our vice president and nine others has been completed. The plane has been found. And I am deeply saddened and sorry to inform you that it has turned out to be a terrible tragedy,\u201d Chakwera\u00a0said. The Malawian leader disclosed that the aircraft was found \u201ccompletely destroyed\u201d near a hill in the Chikangawa\u00a0Forest in northern Malawi, adding that \u201cwords cannot describe how heartbreaking this is.\u201d Chakwera paid tribute to his deputy, describing him as \u201ca good man, a devoted father and husband, (and) a patriotic citizen who served his country with distinction.\u201d \u201cHis passing is a terrible loss to his wife, Mary, his family, his friends, his colleagues in the cabinet and to all of us as a nation,\u201d Chakwera said in his address from the Malawian capital. The president also mourned the loss of the other passengers onboard. The Malawian leader highlighted the tragic nature of the accident, telling journalists that he had himself previously traveled on the same aircraft. \u201cYet despite the track record of the aircraft and the experience of the crew, something terrible went wrong with that aircraft on its flight back to Lilongwe,\u201d he added. On Monday evening, the president had told journalists that air traffic control had advised the vice president\u2019s plane against trying to land, and recommended turning back to the capital due to poor visibility. Not long after, the authorities lost contact with the aircraft, and started a search operation. Earlier on Tuesday, the Malawi Defence Force said it had deployed drones and at least 200 soldiers to search for the plane at the Chikangawa\u00a0Forest reserve where signals of its whereabouts were last received. The Force Commander Paul Valentino Phiri said rescue operations had been delayed by bad weather conditions. The vice president and nine other victims will all be laid to rest in \u201ca dignified manner,\u201d Chakwera said. Their remains arrived in the capital Tuesday evening and were received by Chakwera, live visuals showed. The country will observe a 21-day national mourning for Chilima and the other officials killed in the crash. The mourning period will start on June 11 and last until July 1, according to a statement from the president\u2019s office. United Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said he was \u201cvery saddened\u201d to hear of the plane crash. \u201cWe offer condolences to their families and we stand with the people of Malawi at this sad time,\u201d he said. Chilima, 51, had arrived back in\u00a0Malawi\u00a0on June 6 after attending the Korea-Africa\u00a0Summit in Seoul last week. He first served as deputy to former President Peter Mutharika between 2014 and 2019 before being sworn in as vice president for a second time in 2020. An economist, Chilima previously headed Airtel Malawi, the first Malawian to lead the telecommunications company. \u201cI consider it one of the greatest honors of my life to have had him as my deputy and counsellor for the past four years,\u201d President Chakwera said.

{"id": "2024_06_12_weather_summer-heat-pattern-central-southeast", "text": "A surge of July-like heat is ushering in the hottest conditions of the year so far to the central and eastern US as a major pattern change unfolds. Daily high temperatures will surge up to 15 degrees above what\u2019s typical for June through at least Saturday and threaten dozens of daily high temperature records as sweltering heat in place over the West expands east. And the heat isn\u2019t dropping by for a quick visit, even if it ebbs in some places. There are signs it\u2019ll stick around for the long haul as a predicted hot summer kicks into gear. Parts of the West have been baking since a stifling heat dome set up over the region last week. One person died on Monday while hiking in Colorado National Monument Park in western Colorado, according to a news release from the National Park Service. Temperatures were around 90 degrees. Now, some of that heat and an additional push of hot air from Mexico are enveloping more of the US as the jet stream \u2013 a river of fast-moving air in the upper atmosphere that separates warm air from cold air \u2013\u00a0slowly shifts north over the central and eastern states. Heat will ramp up Thursday from the Plains to the East Coast, marking a considerable change from seasonably cool conditions earlier in the week. Highs in the upper 80s and 90s will be common from the Plains and Midwest to the Southeast, Ohio Valley and mid-Atlantic. Several cities will experience the warmest day of the year so far Thursday, but temperatures will be short of record levels. Humidity will build alongside the heat and make conditions feel even more uncomfortable. The thermometer has yet to climb out of the low 90s in St. Louis this year, but that will change Thursday with a high around 96 degrees. The heat index \u2013 how air feels to the human body \u2013 could approach triple digits. Temperatures will warm even more Friday for much of the Gulf Coast, Southeast and mid-Atlantic as hot air surges north. Highs well into the 90s will stretch from Texas through Georgia and the Carolinas north into parts of Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Friday will be the hottest day of the year so far in Washington, DC. The high temperature could approach the mid-90s, which is about 10 degrees higher than normal. Heat will be at its worst by Saturday for much of the Gulf Coast and Southeast but ease slightly for areas farther north with the passage of a cold front. Atlanta is expected to top out near 99 degrees on Saturday, which would be a temperature record for the date and the hottest reading of the year so far. If the city were to hit 100 degrees it would be the first triple-digit temperature there since August 2019. Highs in the upper 90s and low 100s could also break Saturday\u2019s high temperature records in multiple other Southeast cities including: Birmingham and Montgomery, Alabama, and New Orleans and Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Expansive heat will build once again for much of the central and eastern US on Sunday as the jet stream settles near the US-Canada border and high pressure builds in the upper atmosphere. Anyone hoping for relief is out of luck. A long-lasting heat dome will build early next week in the East and send temperatures soaring even higher.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/weather/summer-heat-pattern-central-southeast/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "world"}}

The prisoner swap was mediated by Oman, the country\u2019s foreign ministry said in a statement. \u201cOmani efforts resulted in the two sides agreeing on a mutual release, as those released were transferred from Tehran and Stockholm,\u201d it said. Sweden had freed convicted former Iranian official Hamid Noury, Iran\u2019s top human rights official said on X. Noury, who had been convicted for his part in a mass execution of political prisoners in Iran in 1988, would be back in Iran in a few hours, the official added. Separately, Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said in a statement that Swedish citizens Johan Floderus and Saeed Azizi who had been detained in Iran were on a plane back to Sweden. \u201cIran used them both as pawns in a cynical negotiations game with the purpose of getting the Iranian citizen Hamid Noury released from prison in Sweden. He is convicted of serious crimes committed in Iran in the 1980s,\u201d Kristersson said. \u201cAs prime minister I have a special responsibility for Swedish citizens\u2019 safety. The government has therefore worked intensively on the issue, together with the Swedish security services which have negotiated with Iran.\u201d Kristersson confirmed in a video released by the government that Noury was now being transported back to Iran. Kristersson declined to give further details around the considerations, citing security concerns. Noury, 63, was arrested at a Stockholm airport in 2019 and later sentenced to life in prison for war crimes for the mass execution and torture of political prisoners at the Gohardasht prison in Karaj, Iran, in 1988. He denied the charges. The National Council of Resistance of Iran, a coalition of groups opposed to Iran\u2019s Islamic Republic government, said it appeared Sweden had yielded to blackmail and hostage-taking tactics in a move that would encourage Tehran. Floderus, a European Union employee, was arrested in Iran in 2022 and charged with spying for Israel and \u201ccorruption on earth,\u201d a crime that carries the death penalty. Swedish-Iranian dual national Saeed Azizi was arrested in Iran in November 2023 on what Sweden called \u201cwrongful grounds.\u201d Another Swedish-Iranian dual national, Ahmadreza Djalali, arrested in 2016, remains in an Iranian jail.

{"id": "2024_06_12_middleeast_andrey-kozlov-family-israel-hamas-gaza-intl", "text": "The family of\u00a0one of the hostages rescued in an Israeli operation over the weekend has said that he experienced psychological abuse over the hands of his Hamas captors during the eight months that he was held in Gaza. Andrey\u00a0Kozlov, 27, was rescued alongside Noa Argamani, Almog Meir Jan and Shlomi Ziv during a raid on the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza on Saturday. The operation was only the third Israeli rescue of hostages held in Gaza and has been celebrated in Israel. But it left a trail of devastation, with authorities in Gaza saying at least 274 Palestinians were killed in the raid and the ensuing firefight with Hamas militants. Kozlov and the others were held in two civilian buildings in the densely packed territory. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has said that the raid was carried out in the two buildings simultaneously for fear the captors would kill some of the hostages if they knew an operation was unfolding. A Russian citizen, Kozlov moved to Israel almost two years ago. He was working as a security guard at the Nova music festival on October 7 when he was kidnapped and taken into Gaza. In an interview with CNN, Kozlov\u2019s family revealed\u00a0some details of their son\u2019s ordeal, including that he initially believed the Israeli forces who saved him had been sent to kill him. Kozlov\u2019s father, Mikhail Kozlov, said his son was \u201cvery scared\u201d because Hamas militants had\u00a0for months\u00a0falsely said that \u201cIsrael wanted to kill them all\u201d\u00a0claiming \u201cthey were a problem for Israel\u201d. \u201cHe was told that Israel wants to kill him. He didn\u2019t understand why the IDF\u00a0came. He was afraid that the IDF came to kill him. It took him some time to realize that they came to rescue him.\u201d Mikhail said his son would not reveal all the ways he\u2019d been mistreated,\u00a0saying\u00a0\u201che wasn\u2019t seen as a human by them.\u201d \u201cI would say that they would punish him for any behavior that they considered was wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the examples that Andrey gave us\u2026 is that at the hottest time of the day they would cover him with blankets,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a very difficult ordeal. To be dehydrated during heat.\u201d His\u00a0brother, Dmitry, said\u00a0\u201cthey were trying not to leave [physical] marks \u2026 But they would still punish him this way or the other. Very often for trivial things.\u201d \u201cHe was told not to speak in Hebrew, you need to whisper and [even that] in English.\u201d Describing their reunion, Mikhail said: \u201cThe first meeting was very touching\u2026 We expected to have a vibrant meeting and some joy, but instead, he knelt down and burst into tears and that was very moving for us.\u201d Dmitry said his brother feels indebted to Israel. \u201cHe says that he doesn\u2019t understand what he has done to deserve this generosity towards him, because he hasn\u2019t done anything. So he feels obliged to pass this goodness on to the next person and help get others [hostages] out.\u201d With the rescue of the four hostages, 116 remain in Gaza from the October 7 attacks, of which 41 are believed to be dead. Mikhail said that he was in favor of securing the release of the remaining hostages by any means \u2013 by negotiation, or further military action. \u201cIf it can be a deal, if a deal can help to release them, then be it,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it\u2019s possible to carry such an operation again, then it should be an operation for the release of these hostages. We need to use any means to return these people back to their families.\u201d \u2018A lot of abuse, almost every day\u2019 The doctor in charge of medical treatment for the four Israeli hostages rescued Saturday said they were beaten while in Hamas captivity in Gaza. \u201cIt was a harsh, harsh, experience, with a lot of abuse, almost every day,\u201d Dr. Itai Pessach told CNN. \u201cEvery hour, both physical, mental and other types, and that is something that is beyond comprehension.\u201d Pessach said the eight months spent in captivity \u201cleft a significant mark on their health\u201d and despite appearing in good condition initially, they are all malnourished.\u00a0 \u201cThey had no protein, so their muscles are extremely wasted, there is damage to some other systems because of that.\u201d He said the hostages told him they were moved several times, dealing with a number of different guards. The supply of food and water was unstable. \u201cThere have been periods where they got almost no food whatsoever, there were other periods where it was a little better, but all in all, the combination of the psychological stress, malnutrition or not getting enough food or not getting the right kind of food, medical neglect, being limited to space, not seeing the sun and all of the other things have significant effect on health.\u201d The testimony is the latest insight into conditions Hamas keeps hostages in. Other hostages\u00a0have previously outlined their ordeals. Keren Munder, her mother and her 9-year-old son \u2013 who were among scores of hostages released under a temporary truce last year - endured days with only pita bread to eat, according to her cousin Merav Mor Raviv. Munder and her mother both lost between six and eight kilograms in weight. Another hostage, 72-year-old Adina Moshe, endured \u201chorrible\u201d conditions while she was held captive, according to her nephew, who added that she didn\u2019t have access to basic facilities like a shower. Israel launched its war in Gaza following the Hamas attacks of October 7, when militants killed about 1,200 people and took more than 250 hostage. Since then, the Israeli campaign has killed more than 37,000 people, according to the ministry of health in Gaza, and triggered a humanitarian crisis. Concerns over food insecurity and famine are growing, with a UN report warning recently that more than one million people, half of Gaza\u2019s population, are \u201cexpected to face death and starvation\u201d by mid-July.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/middleeast/andrey-kozlov-family-israel-hamas-gaza-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "world"}}

In his first season in Bar\u00e7a\u2019s senior team, Yamal made 37 appearances in La Liga and 10 in the Champions League, finishing the campaign with seven goals and 10 assists in all competitions. Widely considered one of football\u2019s most promising young players, both the Blaugrana and Spain have high hopes that the teenager can help lead them to trophies in the near future. It\u2019s certainly a lot of pressure to put on such slight shoulders, but Yamal has already proven this season, notably with some standout performances in the Champions League, that he has no fear of the biggest stage. \u201cI think he\u2019s so mature and can already make the difference for us,\u201d former Bar\u00e7a head coach Xavi recently told reporters of Yamal. \u201cWe have to take care of him, but I think he\u2019s ready and I\u2019m not afraid to trust youth.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/15/sport/lamine-yamal-youngest-player-euros-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_europe_russia-evan-gershkovich-court-trial-intl", "text": "Evan Gershkovich, the first American journalist to be arrested on espionage charges in Russia since the Cold War, will stand trial in the Russian city of Yekaterinburg after prosecutors formally accused him of spying for the CIA. The Russian Prosecutor General\u2019s office said Thursday it had approved the indictment, more than a year after Gershkovich was first detained. If convicted, he faces up to 20 years in prison. Gershkovich, the US government and his employer, the Wall Street Journal, have vehemently denied the charges against him. Less than two weeks after his arrest, Gershkovich was designated as wrongfully detained by the US State Department, which called for his immediate release. Russian prosecutors said the country\u2019s federal security service (FSB) had \u201cestablished and documented\u201d that Gershkovich was acting on CIA instructions in the month he was arrested, alleging he had \u201ccollected secret information\u201d about a Russian tank factory. \u201cGershkovich carried out the illegal actions using painstaking conspiratorial methods,\u201d it said in a statement. US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller on Thursday said the allegations against Gershkovich have \u201cabsolutely zero credibility.\u201d \u201cWe have been clear from the start that Evan has done nothing wrong. He should never have been arrested in the first place. Journalism is not a crime. The charges against him are false, and the Russian government knows that they\u2019re false. He should be released immediately,\u201d Miller said at a State Department briefing. In the year since his arrest, the 32-year-old journalist has been imprisoned in Moscow\u2019s notorious Lefortovo Prison, and his pre-trial detention period had been extended numerous times. On Thursday, the State Department\u2019s top hostage official confirmed \u201cas of today, Evan\u2019s detention and the investigative process has ended.\u201d Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs Roger Carstens said Gershkovich was likely to be moved from Lefortovo to Yekaterinburg \u2013 more than 800 miles away \u2013before the end of June, and was then likely to stand trial in that city. \u201cIf it\u2019s anything like what happened to Brittney Griner, Paul Whelan, Trevor Reed, there\u2019ll be a period when he leaves Lefortovo where we won\u2019t have any contact with him,\u201d Carstens explained, referencing other Americans wrongfully detained in Russia. \u201cIt\u2019ll almost be like it\u2019s gone dark, but eventually, an American or I would say, a detainee surfaces in Yekaterinburg and we\u2019ll have a chance to reestablish that connectivity from there,\u201d Carstens said at a congressional hearing. Responding to Thursday\u2019s announcement, WSJ Editor-in-Chief Emma Tucker said Gershkovich is facing a \u201cfalse and baseless\u201d charge. \u201cRussia\u2019s latest move toward a sham trial is, while expected, deeply disappointing and still no less outrageous. Evan has spent 441 days wrongfully detained in a Russian prison for simply doing his job. Evan is a journalist. The Russian regime\u2019s smearing of Evan is repugnant, disgusting and based on calculated and transparent lies. Journalism is not a crime. Evan\u2019s case is an assault on free press,\u201d Tucker said in a statement. Reporters Without Borders, an international group promoting press freedom, denounced Gershkovich\u2019s indictment. \u201cThe espionage accusations must be abandoned and Evan immediately liberated,\u201d it said in a statement. US Ambassador to Russia Lynne Tracy, speaking after Gershkovich\u2019s pre-trial detention was extended in March, said: \u201cEvan\u2019s case is not about evidence, due process, or rule of law. It is about using American citizens as pawns to achieve political ends.\u201d She called on the Kremlin \u201cto let Evan go.\u201d Proposed swaps Miller, the State Department spokesperson, reiterated on Thursday that the US would continue to pursue Gershkovich\u2019s release, as well that of Whelan, a former US marine who was arrested in Moscow in 2018 and sentenced to 16 years in prison on espionage charges he and the US deny. \u201cWe put a substantial offer on the table to secure the release of Evan and Paul Whelan some months ago, as we said,\u201d Miller said. \u201cObviously, we\u2019re continuing to work to secure their release. We don\u2019t talk about all the details of that publicly.\u201d Russian President Vladimir Putin hinted earlier in the year that \u201can agreement can be reached\u201d with the United States to release Gershkovich, as he brought up the conviction of a \u201cpatriotic\u201d Russian hitman in Germany. Speaking in a lengthy and at times ponderous interview with American right-wing pundit Tucket Carlson in February, Putin alluded to the case of Vadim Krasikov, a former colonel from Russia\u2019s domestic spy organization who was convicted of assassinating a former Chechen fighter in broad daylight in Berlin in 2019. \u201cListen, I\u2019ll tell you: sitting in one country, a country that is an ally of the United States, is a man who, for patriotic reasons, eliminated a bandit in one of the European capitals,\u201d Putin said. Russian government officials\u00a0have\u00a0previously requested\u00a0that Krasikov be released as part of a proposed prisoner swap of notorious Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout for US citizens Griner and Whelan\u00a0according to US officials and\u00a0CNN reporting. Griner, a professional basketball player, was freed in a prisoner exchange for Bout while Whelan remains in prison. Speaking to CNN in Berlin to mark the year since Gershkovich\u2019s detention, Polina Ivanova \u2013 one of his closest friends and a reporter at the Financial Times \u2013 said he was doing \u201cremarkably well\u201d and passing most of his time writing letters \u201ctrying to make us feel better.\u201d \u201cWhen you see Putin talk about it in very clear terms that this is what they want to see happen, that they are looking for a deal, it gives you hope that at some point he will be home. He needs to be home,\u201d Ivanova said. In recent years, Russia has detained a number of other Americans. Russian-American journalist Alsu Kurmasheva was detained in June 2023, Russian-American ballerina Ksenia Karelina was\u00a0arrested in January, and American teacher Marc Fogel\u00a0was arrested in August 2021.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/europe/russia-evan-gershkovich-court-trial-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_europe_russia-ukraine-mariupol-hunger-war-crime-intl", "text": "A group of international human rights lawyers has accused Russia of intentionally starving the civilians of Mariupol as a method of warfare during its 85-day siege of the Ukrainian city in early 2022. A 76-page dossier published Thursday by the Starvation Mobile Justice Team of the human rights organization Global Rights Compliance\u00a0looks in detail at the siege, which it described as \u201chell on earth\u201d for the port city\u2019s residents, through the lens of the war crime of starvation as a calculated strategy. It found that Russian forces \u201csystematically attacked objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population,\u201d while at the same time cutting off evacuation routes and blocking the delivery of humanitarian aid. Ukrainian civilians were cut off from water, electricity and gas and forced to drink from puddles, radiators\u00a0and melted snow. The findings didn\u2019t come as a surprise to Nikolai Osychenko, who described living through the siege as a \u201cStone Age\u201d experience. \u201cThe Russians bombed the substation that supplied electricity to Mariupol on March 2 and we lost electricity, and at the same time, we also lost the water supply and heating,\u201d he told CNN, adding that the city started running out of food almost immediately, because without electricity, much of it has gone bad. \u201cWe all realized that flour is the best thing to have. If you have water and flour, you can cook something.\u00a0But without water, you can\u2019t do anything,\u201d he said. The Mariupol resident spent two weeks living in one apartment with nine other people, rationing food and scraping together any water they could find. They would spend two days melting buckets of snow with their hand, only to get a few inches of dirty water. Osychenko told CNN that at one point, he drank the water from his radiators, boiling it 20 times over to purify it. Deliberately causing starvation and deprivation constitutes a war crime under international law. The group is in the process of submitting their latest report to the International Criminal Court (ICC) as part of a larger dossier on Russia\u2019s use of starvation. According to their website, the organization is funded by the governments of the EU Commission, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States. CNN has reached out to Russia\u2019s Ministry of Defense for comment. Mariupol, a port city on the Sea of Azov, was encircled and captured by Russian forces at the start of\u00a0the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\u00a0Local officials estimate\u00a0that as many as 22,000\u00a0people\u00a0were killed in the battle for the city, which is located in Ukraine\u2019s Donetsk Oblast and has been under direct Russian control since May 2022. \u2018Hell on earth\u2019 It was in\u00a0Mariupol\u00a0that Russian forces carried out some of their most notorious strikes, including an\u00a0attack on a maternity hospital and the\u00a0bombing of a theater\u00a0in which up to 1,300 civilians had sought refuge, according to local officials. The report,\u00a0entitled,\u00a0\u201c\u2019The Hope Left Us:\u2019\u00a0Russia\u2019s Siege, Starvation, and Capture of Mariupol City\u2019\u201d explores how \u201cpeaceful\u201d Mariupol was turned into \u201chell on earth\u201d in February 2022. It uses open-source research to analyse over 1.5 billion square meters of satellite imagery, as well as photographs, videos, official public statements, and other digital data collected between May 2022 and February 2024. Its several hundred\u00a0thousand\u00a0residents were forced to find alternative coping strategies during Russia\u2019s siege, amid dwindling supplies and the obstruction of humanitarian aid. This included the establishment of ad hoc distribution points for food, water and other basic necessities. These distribution points, however, including the\u00a0Mariupol Drama Theater\u00a0and Neptun\u00a0Swimming Pool Complex, became targets for the Russian army. \u201cSustained attacks against Mariupol City forced the distribution of essential items to become largely\u00a0mobile in order to mitigate risks of shelling, though a significant number of both mobile and stationary distribution points were still shelled, repeatedly exposing vulnerable and hungry residents to significant risk to their lives and means of securing basic necessities,\u201d the report found. It also found several instances where the delivery of vital humanitarian aid was allegedly denied or deliberately obstructed by Russian forces, while civilians were unable to evacuate from the city. \u201cDespite Russian forces\u2019 command failing to halt hostilities in order to allow and facilitate rapid and unimpeded passage of humanitarian relief for civilians in need, aid delivery was also directly blocked by pro-Russian forces operating at checkpoints erected around evacuation corridors between Mariupol and Zaporizhzhia.\u201d 85-day offensive Osychenko said he and his family survived the ordeal thanks to his wife\u2019s and niece\u2019s careful planning. \u201cThey were in charge of food and they divided the food very clearly: so much porridge, so much this and so much that for the day. Once I caught them not eating at all. They cooked for us but they didn\u2019t eat because they knew that there was nowhere to get food, and there was less and less of it,\u201d he said. Yousuf Syed Khan, a senior lawyer with law firm Global Rights Compliance, told CNN\u00a0he believes\u00a0there was no doubt that the siege of Mariupol amounted to a war crime. \u201cThey [the Russian army] did not allow for international organizations to provide civilian evacuations\u2026 even though the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) as well as the United Nations attempted numerous times to evacuate civilians. \u201cNumber two is that they did not allow the entry of humanitarian aid. So not once through the 85-day offensive was there any pause in which they allowed humanitarian aid to enter Mariupol.\u201d Khan continued: \u201cOn top of that, they were attacking indispensable objects. They were attacking electricity, they were attacking water. They were attacking food distribution points.\u201d There\u00a0were numerous opportunities for Russian forces to alleviate civilian suffering,\u00a0he said, but they failed to\u00a0do so. Osychenko said that with each day, the situation was getting more and more desperate. Mothers that had small children, many of them \u00a0lost milk from the stress and hunger, there was no formula, no children food,\u201d he said. When Russian troops took over the city, they tried to take advantage of the desperate situation. \u201cWhen Russia came to the city, when they started delivering food to people in basements, giving candies to children, even if you hate Russia, you will go out to them and take it. Because you have nothing to eat, your kids have nothing to drink. It\u2019s brutal,\u201d he said. Khan said the way Moscow\u00a0approached the siege was part of a broader strategy\u00a0that\u00a0Russian and pro-Russian forces have used regularly in the past eight years. He pointed to sieges laid by pro-Russian forces across Syria, including those in\u00a0eastern Aleppo City\u00a0and Ghouta, as examples of heavy-handed Russian tactics. Ukrainian authorities and some international officials have previously accused\u00a0Russia of robbing the country of grain\u00a0and other commodities in areas it occupied.\u00a0Accusations that Russia is using food as a\u00a0weapon of war\u00a0have been mounting ever since the first reports emerged in the spring of 2022 of grain being stolen by Russian troops. The ICC has jurisdiction over war crimes committed in Ukraine. It has so far issued four arrest warrants related to Ukraine, including for Russian President Vladimir Putin over the alleged deportation of Ukrainian children.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/europe/russia-ukraine-mariupol-hunger-war-crime-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_09_europe_european-parliament-far-right-surge-intl", "text": "Far-right parties are predicted to win a record number of seats in the European Parliament, a result that, if confirmed, would deliver a stinging rebuke to Brussels\u2019 political mainstream and add uncertainty to Europe\u2019s future direction. After three days of voting across the European Union\u2019s 27 member states, an exit poll showed that far-right parties were set to win around 150 of the parliament\u2019s 720 seats, which will likely make it harder for mainstream parties to form majorities needed to pass laws. In a speech late Sunday, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the results showed her European People\u2019s Party (EPP) \u2013 predicted to secure the most seats \u2013 could still act as an \u201canchor of stability,\u201d but called on her political allies to help guard against extremist parties. \u201cThe center is holding. But it is also true that the extremes on the left and on the right have gained support, and this is why the result comes with great responsibility for the parties in the center,\u201d she told an audience in Brussels. The full results will trickle in on Monday, when the process of coalition-building will begin as Europe\u2019s centrists seek to put aside their differences to see off a resurgent far right. Most of the far-right gains were concentrated in countries that elect large numbers of seats: France, Italy and Germany. After an exit poll showed Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Rally (RN) party is expected to trounce his own candidates, French President Emmanuel Macron dissolved his parliament and called a risky snap election, with the first round on June 30. RN won 36.8% of the vote, according to official results from the French Interior Ministry on Monday, followed by Macron\u2019s pro-European list on 14.6% and the center-left Socialist Party with 13.8%. In a celebratory speech at the RN headquarters before Macron\u2019s shock announcement, party leader Jordan Bardella said the \u201cunprecedented defeat for the current government marks the end of a cycle, and Day 1 of the post-Macron era.\u201d Like Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz also suffered a stinging blow in the exit poll, as his Social Democrats (SD) scored their worst-ever result of 14%, while the mainstream Christian Democrats Party (CDU) came top with 29.5% of the vote and the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) came second with 16.5%. While the results will shape the political direction of the EU for the next five years, this cluster of national elections is often seen as a de facto referendum on the incumbent domestic governments, which could spell trouble for Macron in France\u2019s 2027 presidential election and for Scholz in Germany\u2019s federal elections next year. A lot has changed in Europe since the last parliamentary elections in 2019, after Britain left the bloc in 2020 and Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, putting much of the continent on a war footing as it sought to send desperately needed supplies to Kyiv and member states shored up their own defenses. \u201cOf course, this election does not take place in a vacuum. The world around us is in turmoil. Forces from the outside and from the inside are trying to destabilize our societies, and they are trying to weaken Europe,\u201d von der Leyen said. While the far-right surge may further complicate Brussels\u2019 bid for unity, the far-right parties themselves remain relatively divided. The AfD is politically homeless: it was removed from the far-right Identity and Democracy (ID) party after its main European candidate, Maximilian Krah, said he did not consider all members of the Nazi group the SS to be criminals. Several other far-right parties are among the non-aligned (NI) group, predicted to secure 45 seats. Responding to the exit poll, Roberta Metsola, president of the European Parliament, said the results showed Brussels\u2019 political establishment needed to \u201cunderstand how people voted\u201d and take decisions \u201cthat have an impact on citizens\u2019 daily lives.\u201d \u201cWe can see that the constructive, pro-European center has held,\u201d she said, but stressed there remains \u201ca responsibility of the groups to come together to form a majority.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/09/europe/european-parliament-far-right-surge-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_americas_brazil-pantanal-wetland-fires-intl-latam", "text": "Brazil\u2019s Pantanal, the largest tropical wetland on earth, is ablaze, with fires in June breaking historical records for that month. While aerial views of the wetland show smoke rising and the bright orange of burning fires, a closer look at burnt vegetation found charred skeletons of wildlife, including an alligator, monkey and snake, photos from Reuters showed earlier this week. Brazil\u2019s National Institute of Space Research (INPE) has detected 733 fires in the Pantanal biome so far this month, with the previous record for fires in Pantanal for June being 435 registered in 2005. The state of Mato Grosso do Sul, which encompasses 60% of the Brazilian Pantanal, is under a \u201cdanger\u201d warning for a heat wave expected to hit with temperatures 5\u00baC higher than average for the next three to five days, according to Brazil\u2019s National Meteorological Institute (INMET). The World Wildlife Foundation (WWF) Brazil has warned that the entire year of 2024 could become the worst year on record for the Pantanal as the dry season is just beginning, and the number of fires this year already represents an increase of 898% compared to the same period in 2023, according to INPE\u2019s data. \u201cIt is necessary to act quickly reinforcing [fire] brigades and counting with the support of the local communities to avoid a catastrophe\u201d, said Cynthia Santos, conservation analyst for WWF Brazil, in a statement. What to know about the wetlands The Pantanal\u2019s distinctive habitats rely on what scientists call the \u201cflood pulse.\u201d During the wet season between November and March, three quarters of the plain gets flooded, only for much of the water to drain away during the dry months, from April to September. This seasonal flooding makes the Pantanal a unique biome where large swaths of land regularly turn from terrestrial into aquatic habitats and back again. Wetlands like the Pantanal are Earth\u2019s most effective carbon sinks \u2013 ecosystems that absorb and store more carbon than they release, keeping it away from the atmosphere. At roughly 200,000 square kilometers, the Pantanal comprises about 3% of the globe\u2019s wetlands and plays a key role in the carbon cycle. When these carbon-rich ecosystems burn, vast amounts of heat-trapping gases are released back into the atmosphere, contributing to the greenhouse effect. According to the World Wide Fund for Nature (known as the World Wildlife Fund in the US and Canada), the Pantanal boasts the greatest concentration of wildlife in South America \u2013 higher than that of its more famous northern neighbor, the Amazon. \u201cThe Pantanal is very important for the planet, it has unique wild areas that are fundamental to life on Earth,\u201d said Andre Luiz Siqueira, the CEO of ECOA, an environmental NGO based in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso do Sul, speaking to CNN in 2020. The area is home to thousands of endangered or unusual species, including jaguars, capybaras, black caimans, giant otters and hyacinth macaws. It\u2019s also an important stop on the routes of around 180 species of migratory birds. The wetland is facing a \u201chydrological crisis scenario\u201d due to an intense drought. The lack of rain began in 2023 and has been aggravated by the ongoing El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon, according to ECOA. Occasional wildfires are normal in the Pantanal, so much so that some plants in the region developed resistance to fires \u2013 for example by growing thick bark or covering their seeds with hard shells. In 2020, the fires destroyed unique habitats and wrecked the livelihoods of many of the Pantanal\u2019s diverse indigenous communities.

{"id": "travel_lgbtq-travel-destinations-homosexuality-criminalized", "text": "When Emma-Jane Nutbrown went on a family vacation to Jamaica last year, she did so with one condition: that everyone donated to an LGBTQ charity once they got there. Nutbrown felt uncomfortable with her parents\u2019 choice of destination. Same-sex sexual activity between men is against the law in Jamaica and carries a maximum jail term of 10 years with hard labor. Both Nutbrown and her brother, Simon \u2013 whose 40th birthday the family was celebrating on that trip \u2013 are gay. \u201cIt made Simon uneasy going there, but most people like to travel for the place, not the politics behind it, so we couldn\u2019t really hold my parents accountable,\u201d says Nutbrown, founder of Queer Edge, which creates safe spaces for the community in London. \u201cI won\u2019t refuse to travel somewhere with family, but I will raise it.\u00a0So instead of us refusing to go, Simon made everyone donate to a charity out there as his birthday present.\u201d Nutbrown and her brother are some of the millions worldwide who have an extra layer to consider when booking a vacation: Will they be safe in the destination, and how are local members of the LGBTQ community treated? \u201cI\u2019m predominantly against it [travel to destinations where homosexuality is banned], but I\u2019m pragmatic. It\u2019s not as easy as \u2018Don\u2019t go,\u2019 \u201d she says. \u201cIf there was a shared consensus across the planet [to boycott destinations] then it would work, but I think it\u2019s a lot more complex.\u201d There are 62 countries worldwide that still criminalize (or de facto criminalize) homosexuality, according to the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (ILGA), which counts UN member states. The Human Dignity Trust counts 64. Of these, 12 could potentially impose the death penalty for same-sex activity, including tourist favorite the United Arab Emirates; Qatar, whose airline was this week deemed the best in the world; Nigeria, which welcomed the Duke and Duchess of Sussex in May; and Saudi Arabia, which last year claimed that it welcomed LGBTQ travelers. Many people \u2013 even those outside the LGBTQ community \u2013 simply will not travel to countries where homosexuality is illegal. Corey O\u2019Neill, an office manager from London, is one. \u201cSafety is at the forefront of anyone\u2019s mind when traveling,\u201d he says. \u201cEven if you\u2019re not visibly queer, there\u2019s an innate danger that how you act might be perceived as gay, which entails not only formal punishments, but police brutality, hate crimes, the general atmosphere. I don\u2019t want to have that in my mind on vacation.\u201d O\u2019Neill\u2019s stance means that unless laws change, he will never see the pyramids (Egypt has de-facto criminalized homosexuality with jail-term punishment); sleep overwater in the Maldives (up to eight years jail-time plus 100 lashes); take a Kenyan safari (maximum 14 years imprisonment); see Red Square (Russia designates the LGBTQ movement \u2013 even displaying a rainbow flag \u2013 as \u2018extremist\u2019 with up to 12-year sentences); or stop over in Qatar (up to 10 years in prison, with \u201cno legal certainty\u201d over a potential death penalty). But he\u2019s OK with that. \u201cWhy would I give money to a country that doesn\u2019t want me to exist? Even if $10 went towards a tax that actively harmed people, that\u2019d be my money I gave them.\u201d It\u2019s not just LGBTQ people who feel this way. Members and allies of the community are currently in their 10th year of boycotting the Dorchester Collection hotels, owned by the Brunei Investment Agency (part of the Ministry of Finance and Economy), since the country introduced laws authorizing the stoning to death of LGBTQ people, as well as the public flogging of women for adultery. In 2019, George Clooney wrote of the importance of boycotting. But while a boycott may be possible against a business, some feel that swerving an entire country harms the local community even more. \u201cIt can cause a very visceral reaction in people, but there are 50 shades of discrimination, and the challenge is where you draw the line,\u201d says Darren Burn, founder of inclusive travel companies Out of Office and TravelGay. \u201cWould you go somewhere you can\u2019t get married, or can\u2019t go into the army? The reality is there are loads of places where, even if it\u2019s not illegal to be gay, there are challenges. I totally respect that some people don\u2019t want to support an economy where [homosexuality] is illegal. But the other side is that I want to go, and by going, I\u2019m helping to change mindsets. Every country has gay people. We hear from staff members and locals in destinations, who say, \u2018Please come.\u2019 \u201d Burn never planned to enter the travel industry. He was a journalist when he went on holiday to Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt. \u201cI was in my early 20s, and I was a bit na\u00efve. It was Sharm \u2013 a tourist haven,\u201d he says. \u201cI was traveling with my ex, and we weren\u2019t allowed to check in. We had to go to another hotel. I thought, that shouldn\u2019t happen to anyone, ever.\u201d In 2016, he founded Out of Office, building a contact book of \u201cwelcoming suppliers and tour guides.\u201d \u2018Do you need two beds?\u2019 In recent years, destination marketers have become more vociferous in attracting LGBTQ clients. There\u2019s usually a financial reason behind it, says Burn. Travelers from the community \u201care less likely to have children and more likely to have disposable income. They\u2019re loyal customers and trust word-of-mouth referrals.\u201d Sherwin Banda, president of luxury safari provider African Travel Inc says that the LGBTQ community has \u201cthe largest disposable income of any other niche market.\u201d \u201cA destination\u2019s reputation as being LGBT-friendly is a primary motivation for us,\u201d he says. A 2021 report from nonprofit Open for Business showed that Caribbean nations outlawing homosexuality saw their GDP hit by up to 5.7% and lost the tourist industry $423 million to $689 million annually. In Jamaica,\u00a0tourism officials\u00a0have tried to downplay the impact of the island nation\u2019s laws against homosexuality. In 2022, legislation was repealed in Barbados, Antigua and Barbuda, and St. Kitts and Nevis. Trinidad and Tobago had already decriminalized same-sex relations in 2018; in April 2024, Dominica followed suit. \u201cThe Caribbean is moving quite quickly,\u201d says Burn, who adds that the anti-homosexuality laws in many Caribbean and African countries were established under European colonialism. Banda, who is South African, agrees. \u201cColonial laws combined with stringent religious beliefs have prolonged a stigma attached to homosexuality across Africa,\u201d he says. However, he is still comfortable arranging safaris for LGBTQ travelers. \u201cOnce we know travelers are from the community, we take great care to ensure guides, hotels, all the touchpoints throughout the journey are safe for them, but also inclusive,\u201d he says. \u201cNobody will say, \u2018Do you need two beds?\u2019 We ensure our clients don\u2019t have to come out again to everyone they meet in Africa.\u201d \u2018Tolerance is practiced not preached\u2019 The experience on the ground is often different from the letter of the law. As Burn says, \u201cIt\u2019s also illegal to drink alcohol in the Maldives, but all resorts have it.\u201d (He advises not holding hands at the airport, however.) In 2020, Bilal El Hammoumy and Rania Chentouf launched Inclusive Morocco, the first LGBT-founded tour operator in a country that punishes same-sex activity with up to three years in jail. \u201cBeing members of the community, we felt we would understand better how to approach it,\u201d says El Hammoumy. \u201cMorocco is a country where tolerance is practiced but not preached. \u201cWe could understand clients\u2019 fears, but on the other hand, it was important to create a space where the local LGBT community can be involved in training programs and hiring opportunities.\u201d El Hammoumy says that in Morocco, \u201cthe reality is a bit different from the law.\u201d In the early 20th century, cities such as Tangier were \u201cgay heavens\u201d for creatives escaping conservative Western countries. One of Marrakech\u2019s main sights is the Majorelle Garden, where the ashes of former owner Yves Saint Laurent were scattered by his former partner, Pierre Berg\u00e9. El Hammoumy says that Moroccan hotels are generally accepting of same-sex couples, but those they work with have extra training to ensure travelers are comfortable. Some guides have opted not to work with them when they explain their clientele, he says. However, he says that visiting destinations can change mindsets. \u201cA lot of anti-LGBT feelings come from prejudice and a lack of education, and direct contact can change preconceived ideas about the community,\u201d he says. Burn agrees. There\u2019s the economic incentive, too. Banda, who grew up under apartheid, believes that South Africa would not have changed without economic pressure from the wider world. \u201cTravel does something no other industry can do,\u201d he says. \u201cAfrica is heavily dependent on tourism dollars. We can advocate for inclusivity with partners who are prepared to actively welcome our guests. If we stay away, we lose that opportunity to use our voice.\u201d Travel can \u2018bring change\u2019 Does that mean every country should be showered in travel dollars in a bid to change opinions? Not according to these experts, none of whom would send a client to Saudi Arabia. Uganda is another sticking point \u2013 its 2023 Anti-Homosexuality Act legalized the targeting of the LGBTQ community in myriad ways and even carries the death sentence. \u201cAs a company, you need to stand for something, and Uganda advocates for brutal violent acts against gay people. We cannot in good conscience send people there,\u201d says Banda. Michael Kajubi has a different perspective. In 2013 he founded McBern Tours, curating Uganda tours, after being fired from his previous job because of \u201csuspicions\u201d that he was gay. \u201cI had to start a company to employ myself and people like me who could not get jobs because of who they are,\u201d he says. The majority of McBern staff are LGBTQ, and all profits go to the McBern Foundation, which supports elderly Ugandans and marginalized youths. Kajubi \u2013 who left Uganda four years ago because of his activism \u2013 says that he is still comfortable sending LGBTQ travelers there, as long as they \u201crespect the laws \u2013 don\u2019t wave their rainbow flag all over the place.\u201d All the hotels that McBern uses \u2013 even for straight guests \u2013 have been carefully vetted as LGBTQ-friendly, says Kajubi. He believes travelers should still visit these destinations but be vigilant where their money is going. He suggests looking for tour operators affiliated to the IGLTA, so that you can be sure you\u2019re not funding inequality. Boycotting leaves the local community stranded, he argues. Companies that have stopped working with McBern because of Uganda\u2019s anti-gay legislation \u201chave a valid point, but supporting local companies can bring change. You\u2019re paying salaries for people who wouldn\u2019t otherwise be employed.  \u201cIf people don\u2019t come we can\u2019t support [Foundation] beneficiaries with healthcare, tuition and basic needs.\u201d \u2018Discrimination all over the place\u2019 Of course, discrimination isn\u2019t confined to countries where homosexuality is illegal. For starters, over 500 anti-LGBTQ laws were introduced in US state legislatures last year alone. In May, the US State Department issued a worldwide alert about potential attacks on LGBTQ+ people and events. In 2014, Matthieu Jost founded MisterB&B, an LGBTQ travel community with 1.3 million members, after an Airbnb host in Barcelona made it clear that he and his partner were unwelcome. Previously, a French hotel had refused him and his then-boyfriend a double bed. \u201cThis kind of discrimination is all over the place, even in 2024,\u201d says Jost, who won\u2019t even hold hands with his partner in Paris. Banda won\u2019t do that in Los Angeles, either. For Jost, traveling to a country where homosexuality is banned means abiding by local rules. MisterB&B users are not allowed to book travel in a country with the death penalty for same-sex behavior. In a destination where it\u2019s illegal, users are flagged before booking. \u201cWe warn travelers they need to be cautious. Ask for separate beds, don\u2019t show personal gestures, let family know where they\u2019re traveling and have the embassy contact,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you really want to go there, you need to respect the laws and religion of these countries and play the game.\u201d Burn adds that booking with a specialist is essential \u2013 his staff have mystery-shopped mainstream tour operators and found them lacking in knowledge, he says. For O\u2019Neill, and many like him, it\u2019s not enough. \u201cI know it limits where I can go \u2013 I\u2019ll probably never see the pyramids or go on safari. But there are so many beautiful places in the world that support queer people. That sounds like a much nicer vacation to me.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/lgbtq-travel-destinations-homosexuality-criminalized/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "travel_christ-redeemer-rio-de-janeiro-brazil-history", "text": "Think of Rio de Janeiro and the first image that comes to mind \u2013 no matter your own belief system \u2013 is probably a religious one. Perched on the Corcovado \u2013 a 2,300-foot-high granite outcrop looming above the city \u2013 the Cristo Redentor (Christ the Redeemer) statue sweeps its arms out in a warm embrace, welcoming visitors to the city of samba. \u201cThe first thing we see when we arrive at the city\u2019s two airports is this brother of ours welcoming us with open arms,\u201d says Rio designer Gilson Martins, whose handbags have been seen on the arms of everyone from Madonna to Michelle Obama. Does he look for the statue when he arrives home after a trip abroad? No, he says \u2013 because there\u2019s no need. \u201cIt is he who finds me when I arrive in Rio.\u201d For over a century, the statue has been a symbol of Rio de Janeiro. In February 1922, architect Heitor da Silva Costa won the competition to design what sounded like a foolhardy project: an enormous statue of Jesus teetering on a high mountain peak as slim as a toothpick. It was inaugurated nine years later. Yet nearly 100 years on, the statue \u2013 98 feet high with an arm span of 92 feet \u2013 is still standing, and is today a symbol of the city, known all over the world. Is it a miracle from on high? Or a testament to the engineering prowess of the Brazilians who built it? For Paulo Vidal, architect and Rio superintendent of the Instituto do Patrim\u00f4nio Hist\u00f3rico e Art\u00edstico Nacional (Institute of Historical and Artistic Heritage, or IPHAN), which approves any restoration projects, it\u2019s the latter. \u201cCivil engineering in Brazil has always been at the forefront of the world, especially in reinforced concrete construction,\u201d he says. And therein lies its secret. Although the Christ the Redeemer looks like a stone sculpture, it\u2019s actually what Vidal calls a \u201cconcrete building covered in soapstone tablets.\u201d That doesn\u2019t mean the construction of it wasn\u2019t heroic, however. Turning back a \u2018sea of godlessness\u2019 The statue\u2019s genesis came from what was essentially an act of religious propaganda: a bid to turn back a post-World War I \u201csea of godlessness\u201d by installing a figure of Jesus Christ to watch over Rio, visible from anywhere in the city \u2013 an omnipresent god made stony flesh. A competition to design the statue was held and Da Silva Costa \u2013 who imagined it almost as a sun salutation, having Jesus illuminated by the dawn and ringed by a rosy \u201chalo\u201d at sunset \u2013 won the commission. It wasn\u2019t always going to be the simple figure that we see today. Initially he designed the sculpture as Christ on the road to Calvary, carrying his cross and a globe in his other hand. Luckily, with the help of artist Carlos Oswald, he switched to the more streamlined, modernist design, in which Christ\u2019s outstretched arms not only form the shape of the cross themselves, but seem to embrace the city below it. French-Polish sculptor Paul Landowski collaborated on the final design, streamlining the shape even further, bringing it in line with Art Deco style that was all the rage at the time. Building such a colossal structure was always going to be difficult; building it on top of a high, perilous peak even more so. Not just because of the difficulty of construction; but also of maintenance. \u201cThe big challenge was to design a project that would withstand the weather,\u201d says Vidal, who says that the peak of Corcovado is \u201cexposed to very aggressive atmospheric conditions.\u201d What\u2019s more, this was to be a sculpture for the ages, \u201ccarefully designed to withstand the elements and to stand the test of time as a symbol of human ingenuity and devotion,\u201d says Vidal. Rio architects were already adept in concrete \u2013 the A Noite building, a city newspaper headquarters, was the highest building in Latin America when it was inaugurated in 1929. Da Silva Costa and his team used that experience, cladding the Christ\u2019s concrete core in steatite, or soapstone, which is known as an insulator, and was traditionally used as cooking pots in the state of Minas Gerais, Vidal explains. It\u2019s tough, too \u2013 a century on, the cladding is still \u201cwell preserved,\u201d he says. The team decided on a mosaic effect \u2013 invisible from far away, but adding detail for those who made the pilgrimage to see it up close. Soapstone was sourced from a quarry in Minas Gerais, chosen for its calm, gray-green hue. It was carved into small pieces \u2013 just over 1.5 inches in length and 0.2 inches thick, according to M\u00e1rcia Braga, the architect and restoration expert who led a major conservation project of the monument in 2010 \u2013 and attached to the cement \u201cbody.\u201d There are around 6 million tiles on the Christ Redeemer in total. Work began in 1926, funded mainly by the church in Rio, and on October 12, 1931, the statue was inaugurated. Today, it\u2019s part of the \u201cCarioca Landscapes between the Mountain and the Sea\u201d UNESCO World Heritage site, established in 2012. Four years earlier, the statue had been listed by IPHAN for its historical importance. It had been declared a municipal heritage site in 1990. It\u2019s also the largest Art Deco statue in the world. Constant conservation Of course, the same ingenuity that Vidal refers to regarding its engineering has also been on full display during the past century as extreme weather batters Corcovado. The fact that a visit to the Christ the Redeemer \u2013 either taking a tiny train to the peak, or hiking up \u2013 is a must-do activity in Rio, with around 2 million visitors per year, means it\u2019s even more important to keep the statue safe. It\u2019s no easy task. \u201cConservation is a major challenge because it\u2019s exposed to very aggressive atmospheric conditions \u2013 whether that\u2019s the sun\u2019s rays, which cause the mantle and structure to expand and shrink every day, or the southwest winds that hit the statue laden with salt and sand, causing constant abrasion to the coating,\u201d explains Vidal. Then there\u2019s lightning. Rio de Janeiro is a city of storms, and this high peak attracts strikes like bees to a honeypot. Lightning rods were originally built into the statue\u2019s head to help with strikes. Vidal says that these have been expanded over the years, as storms increase in intensity. In 2021, the \u2018crown\u2019 of rods was quadrupled in size, and the earthing system was expanded. The statue has undergone a major conservation effort every decade since 1980, but Vidal says the site is \u201cconstantly\u201d monitored for any emergency maintenance that might be needed. \u201cWe know the materials, the degradation processes, the aggressive agents and the behavior of the structure,\u201d he says. The Christ has five large, covered holes for conservators to enter inside \u2013 one on top of its head, and four more on the shoulders and elbows. There are 14 smaller holes which, when open, help with air circulation, says Braga. \u201cInside the statue, you feel as if you were totally protected from the weather and environment,\u201d she says. \u201cThere is silence \u2013 it is a very strong structure, and as you are climbing to the head, the spaces to cross through get very narrow. When you finally get out on the top of the head, it is a wonderful sensation of freedom.\u201d Replacing 300,000 tiles Braga \u2013 who calls the restoration project an \u201cenormous responsibility\u201d \u2013 was 50 when she worked on the statue. \u201cI felt as if it was a great event in my professional career,\u201d she says. In a 2011 paper about the project, shared with CNN, she wrote that her team found spores from the Atlantic rainforest on the statue \u2013 making the monument even more redolent of Rio and Brazil as a whole. The bacteria were cleaned off with steam and water jets at 158 degrees Fahrenheit. The statue was also regrouted. No detail is ignored during the conservation projects, the most recent of which took place from 2020-2022. The soapstone from the original quarry has run out over the past century \u2013 \u201cthis color is increasingly difficult to find in the natural world,\u201d wrote Braga of her conservation project \u2013 so when pieces of mosaic need replacing, conservators carefully look at stone from other quarries in Minas Gerais, to try and match the original color as best as possible. During her renovation, Braga rejected 80% of the replacement tesserae, picking only those that best matched the original color. She also replaced stones that had been added in previous restorations but weren\u2019t a good color match, replacing 5% of those 6 million tesserae in total. Such herculanean efforts are worth it, says Vidal. \u201cChrist the Redeemer is an iconic image that publicizes the city and the country to the world,\u201d he says. \u201cIt attracts tourism and consequently foreign currency to the city.\u201d Gilson Martins agrees. Christ Redeemer bags are his top sellers, tied with those sporting the Sugarloaf Mountain. \u2018Like a childhood friend\u2019 For cariocas \u2013 the inhabitants of Rio de Janeiro \u2013 the Christ has become like a family member. Tom Jobin, the bossa nova grandee who composed The Girl from Ipanema, wrote of its \u201copen arms over Guanabara\u201d in his song, Samba do Avi\u00e3o. Another song was called, simply, Corcovado. \u201cDa janela, ve-se o Corcovado, O Redentor, que lindo,\u201d he wrote \u2013 \u201cFrom the window you can see Corcovado, the Redeemer, how beautiful.\u201d Martins himself has produced two art exhibitions centered around the sculpture, and has recently made an EP, singing about the statue in three of the five songs. In fact, he says, it was his childhood memories of observing the statue that inspired his songwriting. \u201cTo me, he is my brother, my friend of many years, always present in my life,\u201d he says of the Christ. \u201cThe feeling is like having a childhood friend with whom I have a lot of intimacy, and he is always there for us to talk to.\u201d Martin\u2019s deep devotion to the concrete statue is a sentiment shared by cariocas across the city. \u201cFor me, as a carioca, architect and urban planner, Christ the Redeemer is a landmark of territorial identification. If I see Christ the Redeemer I know where I am, and that I am at \u2018home,\u2019\u201d says Vidal. \u201cIn order to be sung about in music, the statue needs to be loved by the population \u2013 and it is. It welcomes and embraces residents and visitors.\u201d For Francesco Perrotta-Bosch, architecture critic and the biographer of modernist architect Lina Bo Bardi, Corcovado is \u201cthe most democratic landmark in the city.\u201d Rio de Janeiro is famously a place where great wealth and poverty live side by side, but in a sense, the sculpture unites them. \u201cYou can see it from rich neighborhoods and poor neighborhoods,\u201d he says. \u201cCariocas can observe it from the south or north zone and will have a reference to find themselves in the city. Largely due to Corcovado, Rio becomes a city with many visual elements that help a visitor not to get lost in it.\u201d \u2018Some people cry\u2019 Tourists seem as fond of the statue as locals. Deemed one of the seven modern wonders of the world, the Christ the Redeemer is Rio\u2019s most visited attraction, says tour guide Cristina Arroio. Her guests \u201cthink it\u2019s amazing. Some people are very sensitive and they cry. Some say it\u2019s a dream come true to go all the way up and be close to the statue,\u201d she says. Gilson Martins, who can see the statue from his home, calls it \u201cthe carioca host that welcomes Rio, Brazil and the world with open arms.\u201d \u201cThe atmosphere of Rio is formed by an intense energy of human warmth, relaxation, joy, lightness, sensuality, and receptivity,\u201d he says. \u201cChrist on top of Corcovado is the accomplice to all this carioca spirit. It complements all the beauty of the beaches, the Sugarloaf Mountain, the carnival, the samba dancers, and the entire carioca way of being.\u201d How fitting for laid-back, multicultural Brazil, that a sculpture built as a symbol of one religion has ended up representing the welcoming atmosphere of the entire country. Maybe that\u2019s the ultimate miracle of Christ the Redeemer.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/christ-redeemer-rio-de-janeiro-brazil-history/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_europe_pope-comedians-vatican-intl-hnk", "text": "As world leaders gather in Italy for a summit addressing entrenched global crises, Pope Francis hosted an international gathering of a different sort on Friday to broadcast his own message \u2013 of the importance of humor. The leader of the Catholic Church hosted the equivalent of a conclave of comedians in the Vatican by inviting Whoopi Goldberg, Jimmy Fallon, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Chris Rock, Stephen Colbert, Conan O\u2019Brien and others to the Vatican. Over 200 people were in the audience at the Apostolic Palace, with more than 100 comedians from 15 countries. Goldberg and Louis-Dreyfus were visible in the front row. Before proceedings got under way Fallon was seen larking around at the front of the audience hall, before quickly being told to get to his seat as the pope was about to walk through the door. \u201cIn the midst of so much gloomy news, immersed as we are in many social and even personal emergencies, you have the power to spread peace and smiles,\u201d the pontiff told the gathering. \u201cYou unite people, because laughter is contagious,\u201d he said, adding that he has prayed for 40 years for a good sense of humor, adding his own joke and the end, where he asked the audience to \u201cI ask you to please pray for me: for, with a smile, not against!\u201d \u2013 and was obliged with laughter from the crowd. \u201cYou manage to make people smile even while dealing with problems and events, large and small. You denounce abuses of power; you give voice to forgotten situations; you highlight abuses; you point out inappropriate behavior,\u201d Pope Francis added. The 87-year-old pontiff said that humor can overcome \u201csocial barriers\u201d and help create \u201cconnections among people.\u201d \u201cWhile communication today often generates conflict, you know how to bring together diverse and sometimes contrary realities. How much we need to learn from you!\u201d the Pope said. Pope Francis also said it was okay to \u201claugh at God\u201d in the same way \u201cwe play and joke with the people we love.\u201d After delivering his speech, Francis greeted all the comedians individually, sharing a laugh and joke with several of them, including Rock, Fallon and Colbert, as he left the audience hall. \u201cIt was great,\u201d\u00a0Whoopi Goldberg told reporters. When asked if she had again asked the pope if he would appear in \u201cSister Act 3,\u201d she said: \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was the right place to bring it up, but I\u2019ll probably send an email.\u201d Conan O\u2019Brien said afterwards: \u201cWe are all looking at each other thinking \u2018something\u2019s wrong\u2019. We are in this beautiful, beautiful space in the Vatican and for some reason they\u2019ve let comedians in which is always a mistake.\u201d A papal outreach The Pope hosted the comedians as leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) democratic advanced economies gather for a three-day summit in southern Italy, where they face thorny global issues including how to continue to support Ukraine nearly two and half years into Russia\u2019s invasion. The Pope is expected to become the first leader of the Catholic church to participate in the G7 summit later Friday, when he is slated to take part in a session dedicated to AI. US President Joe Biden, a Catholic who has a warm relationship with Francis, is among the leaders expected to be present at the gathering. Francis\u2019 meeting on Friday with\u00a0\u201cartists from the world of humor\u201d\u00a0is part of his latest attempt to engage with contemporary culture, with the Vatican explaining in a statement that the meeting underlines how the \u201cart of comedy can contribute to a more empathetic and supportive world.\u201d It follows on from his\u00a0landmark visit to the Venice Biennale\u00a0and his meeting last year with\u00a0artists and directors in the Vatican.\u00a0The meeting also comes with the pope facing\u00a0question marks\u00a0over his outreach to\u00a0LGBTQ+ Catholics\u00a0after reportedly using a homophobic slur at private meetings. Others from the US contingent included Tig Notaro, Jim Gaffigan with several Catholics among them: both Gaffigan and Colbert identify as Catholics while Fallon and O\u2019Brien were both raised in the Catholic Church.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/europe/pope-comedians-vatican-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "world"}}

Among those released was the Council\u2019s former Speaker, Aziz Dweik, who had been held for nine months, accused of affiliation with Hamas. He appeared much thinner and greyer than before being detained. The Council said it \u201clooks with anger at the crimes committed by the enemy against the prisoners, and the greatest example is the photo of Dr. Aziz Dweik when he left the occupation prisons.\u201d The Council alleged that the prisoners had been subjected to starvation, isolation and torture. Dweik himself said Friday that prisoners were\u00a0\u201cstarved for 24 hours a day. The prisoners are in poor health conditions, suffering from skin diseases, and the food is insufficient even for children, let alone meeting the needs of men.\u201d He added that sugar, salt, and fruit were virtually absent in the prisons. CNN has asked the Israel Defense Forces and prison authorities for a response to the allegations made by the Council. Most of the approximately 30 prisoners released from the Negev and Ofer prisoners this week were administrative detainees, who had not been charged with any offenses. One of them, according to the Palestinian Prisoners\u2019 Society, was Saed Abu Shanab from Tulkarm, who had spent 21 years in Israeli prisons. The Prisoners\u2019 Society said that the condition of the prisoners \u201creflect some of the harsh and humiliating conditions of detention, including acts of torture, abuse and starvation, in addition to medical crimes.\u201d In May, CNN published an investigation based on testimonies from whistleblowers at the Negev facility which reported that \u201cdoctors sometimes amputated prisoners\u2019 limbs due to injuries sustained from constant handcuffing; [and] of medical procedures sometimes performed by underqualified medics.\u201d In response to that reporting, the IDF responded that it \u201censures proper conduct towards the detainees in custody. Any allegation of misconduct by IDF soldiers is examined and dealt with accordingly.\u201d The Israeli military has acknowledged partially converting\u00a0three different military facilities into detention camps for Palestinian detainees from Gaza\u00a0since the Hamas-led October 7 attack on Israel.

But World War II\u00a0veteran Harold Terens\u00a0and his sweetheart Jeanne Swerlin proved that love is eternal as they tied the knot Saturday inland of the D-Day beaches in Normandy, France. Their respective ages \u2014 he\u2019s 100, she\u2019s a youngster of just 96 \u2014 made their nuptials an almost double-century celebration.

Like other towns and villages across the Normandy coast where nearly 160,000 Allied troops came ashore under fire on five code-named beaches, it was an effervescent hub of remembrance and\u00a0celebration on the 80th anniversary\u00a0of the deeds and sacrifices of young men and women that day, festooned with flags and bunting and with veterans feted like rockstars. As the swing of Glenn Miller and other period tunes rang out on the streets, well-wishers \u2013 some in WWII-period clothes \u2013 were already lined up a good hour before the wedding, behind barriers outside the town hall, with a rousing pipe and drum band also on hand to serenade the happy couple. After both declaring \u201coui\u201d to vows read by Carentan\u2019s mayor in English, the couple exchanged rings. \u201cWith this ring, I thee wed,\u201d Terens said. She giggled and gasped, \u201cReally?\u201d With champagne flutes in hand, they waved through an open window to the crowds outside. \u201cTo everybody\u2019s good health. And to peace in the world and the preservation of democracy all over the world and the end of the war in Ukraine and Gaza,\u201d Terens said as he and his bride then clinked glasses and drank. The crowd yelled \u201cla mari\u00e9e!\u201d - the bride! \u2013 to Swerlin, who wore a long, flowing dress of vibrant pink. Terens looked dapper in a light-blue suit and pink kerchief in his breast pocket. And they enjoyed a very special wedding-night party: They were invited to the state dinner at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace on Saturday night with\u00a0President Emmanuel Macron and US President Joe Biden. \u201cCongratulations to the newlyweds,\u201d Macron said, prompting cheers and a standing ovation from other guests during the toast praising French-American friendship. \u201c(The town of) Carentan was happy to host your wedding, and us, your wedding dinner,\u201d he told the couple. The wedding was symbolic, not binding in law. Mayor Jean-Pierre Lhonneur\u2019s office said he wasn\u2019t empowered to wed foreigners who aren\u2019t residents of Carentan, and that the couple, who are both American, hadn\u2019t requested legally binding vows.However, they could always complete those formalities back in Florida if they wished. Lhonneur likes to say that Normandy is practically the 51st state of the US, given its reverence and gratitude for Allied soldiers and the sacrifices of tens of thousands who never made it home from the Battle of Normandy. \u201cLove is eternal, yes, maybe,\u201d the mayor said, referring to the newlyweds, although his comments also fittingly describe the feelings of many Normans for veterans. \u201cI hope for them the best happiness together.\u201d Dressed in a 1940s dress that belonged to her mother, Louise, and a red beret, 73-year-old Jane Ollier was among spectators who waited for a glimpse of the lovebirds. The couple, both widowed, grew up in New York City: she in Brooklyn, he in the Bronx. \u201cIt\u2019s so touching to get married at that age,\u2019\u2019 Ollier said. \u201cIf it can bring them happiness in the last years of their lives, that\u2019s fantastic.\u201d The WWII veteran first visited France as a 20-year-old US Army Air Forces corporal shortly after D-Day. Terens enlisted in 1942 and, after shipping to Britain, was attached to a four-pilot P-47 Thunderbolt fighter unit as their radio repair technician. On D-Day, Terens helped repair planes returning from France so they could rejoin the battle. He said half his company\u2019s pilots died that day. Terens himself went to France 12 days later, helping transport freshly captured Germans and just-freed American POWs to England. Following the Nazi surrender in May 1945, Terens again helped transport freed Allied prisoners to England before he shipped back to the US a month later. Swerlin made it abundantly clear that her new centenarian husband doesn\u2019t lack for\u00a0rizz. \u201cHe\u2019s the greatest kisser ever, you know?\u201d she proudly declared before they embraced enthusiastically for TV cameras. \u201cAll right! That\u2019s it for now !\u201d Terens said as he came up for air. To which she quipped: \u201cYou mean there\u2019s more later?\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/europe/wwii-vet-marries-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_09_europe_macron-dissolves-french-parliament-europe-intl", "text": "France\u2019s President Emmanuel Macron has dissolved the country\u2019s parliament, the National Assembly, and called a snap election after an exit poll showed his Renaissance party is set to be trounced by the far-right opposition in European parliamentary elections on Sunday. After initial projections, the far-right National Rally (RN) party came out on top with 31.5% of the vote, more than double the share of Renaissance, which scraped into second place on 15.2% of the vote, just ahead of the Socialists in third with 14.3% of the vote. In a celebratory speech after the publication of the exit poll, RN leader Jordan Bardella had called on Macron to dissolve the French parliament, calling the gap between the two parties a \u201cstinging disavowal\u201d for the president. \u201cThis unprecedented defeat for the current government marks the end of a cycle, and Day 1 of the post-Macron era,\u201d Bardella told a raucous audience at RN\u2019s headquarters. Within an hour, Macron made a national address, announcing he would dissolve the French lower house and hold parliamentary elections. The first round will be held on June 30, with a second round on July 7, Macron said. \u201cI have decided to give you back the choice of your parliamentary future by voting. I am therefore dissolving the National Assembly this evening,\u201d Macron said in the shock announcement. \u201cThis decision is serious, heavy. But it is above all, an act of trust. Trust in you, my dear compatriots. In the capacity of the French people to make the most just decision,\u201d the French president added. Under the French system, parliamentary elections are held to elect the 577 members of the lower house, the National Assembly. Separate elections are held to choose the country\u2019s president, which are not scheduled again until 2027. In the last set of parliamentary elections held in 2022, the Ensemble coalition including Macron\u2019s Renaissance party fell short of an overall majority and were forced to seek help from elsewhere. Speaking after Macron\u2019s announcement, Marine Le Pen \u2013 who ran unsuccessfully against Macron for the French presidency in 2017 and 2022, but whose RN party has since enjoyed a resurgence in the polls \u2013 said she welcomed his decision to hold elections. \u201cWe are ready to take power if the French place their trust in us,\u201d said Le Pen, now the parliamentary leader of RN. \u201cWe are ready to rebuild the country, ready to defend the interests of the French, ready to put an end to mass immigration, ready to make the purchasing power of the French a priority, ready to begin the reindustrialization of the country,\u201d she said. Since the beginning of his second term in 2022, Macron has been ruling with a relative majority, forcing him to invoke Article 49.3 of the French constitution several times \u2013 pushing legislation through parliament without a vote, to the increasing displeasure of opposition lawmakers and much of the French public. The last time a French president dissolved parliament was in 1997, which led to Jacques Chirac losing his majority and ushering the Socialists into power under Lionel Jospin. An \u00c9lys\u00e9e source close to Macron, who asked to remain anonymous, told CNN the predicted results showed there is a \u201crepublican majority\u201d in France made up of those who \u201cdon\u2019t agree with the far-right ideas.\u201d \u201cWe should never be afraid of the French people,\u201d the source said. \u201cConvince, convince, convince \u2013 that is the spirit that the presidential majority will take up.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/09/europe/macron-dissolves-french-parliament-europe-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_middleeast_hezbollah-lebanon-israel-tensions-explainer-update-intl", "text": "Israel and the Lebanese Iran-backed Islamist group Hezbollah have been ramping up cross-border attacks after months of low-intensity fighting, prompting the Israeli military to warn that it is prepared to launch a large-scale attack on its northern border. With both sides trading fire for more than eight months, experts say Israel feels it can no longer ignore its northern front or delay taking action there. A full-blown war appears to have become more likely \u2013 even if both sides have no desire for one, analysts believe. Here\u2019s what we know: Why are Israel and Hezbollah fighting? Lebanon and Israel have officially been in a state of war for decades. Israel launched a devastating invasion of Lebanon in 1982, sending tanks all the way to the capital Beirut,\u00a0after coming under attack from Palestinian militants in the country. It then occupied southern Lebanon for 22 years until it was driven out by Hezbollah, which emerged from the rubble of the Israeli invasion. Hezbollah is an Iran-backed Lebanese movement with one of the region\u2019s most powerful paramilitary forces. The \u201cresistance\u201d group is tasked with confronting Israel, which Beirut classifies as an enemy state. Much of the Western world has designated Hezbollah a terrorist organization. Since then, the two sides have traded fire sporadically, but tensions boiled over in 2006 when Israel went to war in southern Lebanon again after Hezbollah kidnapped two Israeli soldiers. More than 1,000 Lebanese were killed in that conflict, mostly civilians, as well as 49 Israeli civilians and 121 soldiers. Two years later, Hezbollah returned the remains of the kidnapped soldiers in exchange for the release of Lebanese and Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails, as well as the bodies of militants Israel was holding. The latest hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah started after Hamas led an attack on Israel on October 7, killing 1,200 people and abducting 250, according to Israeli authorities. That prompted Israel to go to war with Hamas in Gaza, during which it has levelled much of the territory and killed more than 37,000 Palestinians. Hezbollah has said its current round of fighting with Israel is to support the Palestinians in Gaza. The military capability of the Lebanese group has grown since 2006, when it relied largely on inaccurate Soviet-era Katyusha rockets. Today, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah says his group boasts more than 100,000 fighters and reservists. The group is also believed to possess 150,000 rockets that could overwhelm Israel\u2019s defenses if an all-out war breaks out. Why are tensions flaring up now? The conflict between Israel and Hezbollah has been gradually intensifying since October 7, said Heiko Wimmen, project director for Iraq, Syria and Lebanon at the International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based think tank. It\u2019s a \u201cslow-motion escalation\u201d that \u201cinches upwards,\u201d he said. But both sides have come closer to war of late as clashes across the border have grown in number and scale. \u201cThere is clearly an escalation,\u201d said Wimmen, particularly in terms of deaths on each side of the border and the type of weaponry Hezbollah has been deploying. An Israeli reservist was killed in a Hezbollah strike on a village in northern Israel last week, bringing the total number of soldiers killed on the Israeli side to 19. Israel killed one of Hezbollah\u2019s most senior commanders, Talib Sami Abdulla, in a strike on southern Lebanon this week. The IDF said the commander was responsible for multiple attacks against Israeli civilians over several years. In retaliation, Hezbollah launched more than\u00a0200 rockets toward Israel on Wednesday and a significant but smaller barrage on Thursday. Israel and Hezbollah have also been striking much deeper into each other\u2019s territory than they were at the beginning of the war, when fighting was confined to a roughly 4-kilometer (2.5-mile) radius of the border on either side. Hezbollah has fired 35 kilometers into Israel, while Israel has targeted areas of Lebanon more than 120 kilometers north. Cross-border attacks from Lebanon in early June led to large fires blazing through Israel\u2019s northern region,\u00a0which Israel attributed to rocket fire from southern Lebanon, where Hezbollah said it had launched a \u201cswarm of drones\u201d at Israeli military sites. Amal Saad, a lecturer at Cardiff University and an expert on Hezbollah, said the group\u2019s escalation \u201cis a marked departure from prior flare-ups that have occurred since October 8.\u201d \u201cThis stage transcends merely responding to Israeli attacks and restoring deterrence; it involves conveying new messages and strategies,\u201d Saad wrote on X on June 5. The conflict has become \u201cvery visible\u201d and \u201cdifficult to ignore,\u201d said Wimmen, of the International Crisis Group, adding that Israeli officials feel compelled to respond, or at least be seen as responding, amid pressure to react from far-right ministers in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government. There is a push within government and the Israeli army to take action in the north, Ronni Shaked, a scholar at the Truman Institute at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, told CNN. \u201cNobody can live in this situation.\u201d New weapons at play The cross-border conflict has seen new weapons come into the mix. In an escalatory development on June 8, Hezbollah said it fired a salvo of Falaq 2 rockets at a military site in northern Israel. This was the first time the group had deployed the weapon, which is an improved version of the Falaq 1 rocket that Hezbollah has used throughout the conflict. An Iranian-made rocket, the Falaq 2 has a longer range and carries a larger warhead than its predecessor. An Iranian-made rocket, the Falaq 2 has a longer range and carries a larger warhead than its predecessor. Israeli soldiers on the border with Lebanon have also used a catapult rarely used by military forces since the 16th century. The trebuchet, a rotating arm with a sling attached to launch a projectile, was used to launch fireballs from Israel toward Lebanese territory, likely to burn shrubbery to make it easier for Israeli forces to identify militants. Israeli public broadcaster and CNN affiliate Kan on Thursday reported that the IDF had said the catapult was \u201ca local initiative\u201d and had not \u201ccome into widespread use.\u201d What are both sides saying? Rhetoric has been fiery from both sides, but experts say neither side wants a full-blown conflict. Netanyahu in December warned that Beirut would turn into Gaza if Hezbollah chose to start an all-out war. But Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich last week poured cold water on the prospect of a wider war, saying the IDF isn\u2019t interested in broadening the war to eliminate Hezbollah. The military is \u201ctelling us right now that it doesn\u2019t want to\u2026 launch an attack in the north, fight and defeat Hezbollah, and overwhelm it and create a security zone.\u201d During his visit to the northern city of Kiryat Shmona near the Lebanese border last week, Netanyahu said Israel was prepared for \u201cvery intense action\u201d in the north. \u201cWhoever thinks that they can hurt us and that we will sit idly by is making a big mistake,\u201d the prime minister said. \u201cOne way or another, we will restore security to the north.\u201d Naim Qassem, Hezbollah\u2019s second-in-command, told Al Jazeera that the group had assessed that recent threats from Israel were not serious. \u201cEither way, we have decided not to widen the battle and we do not want an all-out war. But if it is imposed on us, we are ready and we won\u2019t retreat,\u201d Qassem said, adding that Hezbollah will end its attacks on Israel once the war in Gaza stops. Is a full-blown war likely? Experts say that while both sides may not choose to start an all-out war, their escalatory actions may still trigger one inadvertently. Wimmen of the International Crisis Group said that Israel and Hezbollah are unlikely to take a conscious decision to start a war. However, the more intense the conflict becomes, the deeper each side strikes into the other\u2019s territory and the heavier the weapons used, the more likely it is that \u201csomething goes wrong,\u201d he said. Netanyahu is under intense pressure from the opposition and members of his coalition to take action in the north, especially given that so many Israelis have been displaced from the area. More than 53,000 Israelis have been forced to leave their homes in the north, the IDF said. More houses were evacuated this week in the Galilee region in northern Israel after a fire broke following rocket attacks from Lebanon, Israeli police said. In Lebanon, more than 94,000 people have been displaced from areas and towns near the border with Israel since the conflict started, according to figures released last week by the Lebanese Ministry of Public Health. \u201cAll Hezbollah strongholds must be burned and destroyed. War!\u201d said Israeli far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir in a statement. Opposition leader Yair Lapid also slammed the government, saying: \u201cThe north goes up in flames and Israeli deterrence burns with it. \u201cThe government has no plan for the day after in Gaza, no plan to return the residents to the north, no management, no strategy. A government of total abandonment,\u201d Lapid said on X. The US has cautioned against escalation, worried it might spin out of control. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Wednesday the United States is \u201cincredibly concerned\u201d about the risk of escalation, adding that the Biden administration is engaged in diplomatic conversations \u201cto try to avoid that conflict from escalating beyond control.\u201d Shaked, the Truman Institute scholar, said that despite Hezbollah\u2019s assertions that its attacks on Israel are in support of Gaza, the group\u2019s strategy is likely to be closely coordinated with its closest ally Iran \u2013 especially with so much at stake. Hezbollah is Iran\u2019s most effective non-state partner. A wider conflict could also draw the Islamic Republic and the United States into the war. Israel and Iran came close to war in April after launching unprecedented direct attacks on each other\u2019s soil.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/middleeast/hezbollah-lebanon-israel-tensions-explainer-update-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_weather_friday-flooding-rain-storm-south-florida", "text": "Heavy rainfall that\u2019s caused unrelenting flooding in South Florida since Tuesday is drenching the state for a fourth consecutive day Friday. The days of deadly, torrential storms have turned roads into canals and forced some residents to stand on the roofs of their cars or trudge through waist-deep waters. Two people were killed in a weather-related vehicle crash late Wednesday afternoon southeast of Fort Myers, according to the Florida Highway Patrol. Identified only as a 35-year-old woman and a 25-year-old-man, the two died after their vehicle \u201clost control due to weather\u201d conditions and crashed into opposing traffic, the FHP said. Two others were injured in the crash. Since heavy rain started swamping the region Tuesday, the flooding has become waist-deep in some places. Hazardous conditions on streets and roadways have stranded drivers and made roads impassable. And they\u2019ve forced some schools in hard-hit counties to shutter and hundreds of flights to be canceled or delayed. With tropical moisture still streaming over South Florida, the Weather Prediction Center has issued a level 3 of 4 flood threat Friday \u2013 just one level lower than the rare high risk of excessive rainfall seen Thursday. Robust tropical moisture fueling the soaking storms slowly starts to shift out of the area over the weekend, but Friday marks yet another drenching day for South Florida. By week\u2019s end, multiple cities could see more than 2 feet of rain. \u201cEven moderate rain rates are likely to cause additional flash flooding, as any rainfall will be unable to drain\u201d due to ongoing flooding, the WPC warned Friday. Flood watches remain in effect for over 7 million people across South Florida, including in Miami and Fort Lauderdale, through Friday evening. An additional 2 to 4 inches or more of rainfall is expected through Friday night. Thunderstorm activity is expected to diminish over the weekend, but any rain Saturday or early Sunday could worsen ongoing flooding issues. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency for Broward, Collier, Lee, Miami-Dade and Sarasota counties, and officials have urged locals to stay at home instead of walking or driving through the floodwater, which has covered streets and seeped into homes. Many cities have been distributing sandbags to residents to help combat the rising floodwaters. Flooding brought back familiar dangers for Florida residents With flooding from the rainfall deluging South Florida since Tuesday morning, footage on social media has shown water levels in the area reaching to vehicles\u2019 windows and filling up parking decks and neighborhood streets. Notably, many South Florida residents had just finished repairing their homes after\u00a0catastrophic flooding in April 2023, only to find water lapping at their doorsteps this week. In Miami, video showed stranded cars that were nearly entirely submerged under water. One area family\u2019s yard looked like a lake as belongings floated outside and were pulled from the standing water, according to CNN affiliate WSVN. \u201cI\u2019m scared,\u201d 11-year-old Somaya Ferdinand told WSVN as she waded through thigh-high water outside her home in Northeast Miami-Dade. \u201cIt looked like a swimming pool.\u201d And in Hallandale Beach, just north of Miami, footage showed one man kayaking among cars as high waters flooded parts of the city. Some mobile home parks were underwater, said Broward County Sheriff\u2019s Office Fire Rescue Battalion Chief Michael Kane. Severe flooding there on Wednesday covered cars up to their windshields, forcing some drivers to abandon their stalled-out vehicles and wade to safety. Others had to be rescued. \u201cWe had to use our boats to rescue people standing on top of the roofs of cars,\u201d Kane told CNN. Kane\u2019s office received 175 calls for help in Hallandale Beach alone. Anna Rysedorph, a resident of the Broward County neighborhood of Edgewood, prepared for the worst as water circled her ankles in her home. \u201cI put the dogs in, I\u2019m all packed up. I pretty much got everything in bins and we\u2019re ready to go,\u201d Edgewood resident Anna Rysedorph told\u00a0CNN affiliate WSVN\u00a0Wednesday. \u201cMy husband\u2019s like \u2018Don\u2019t panic, don\u2019t panic,\u2019 but you know, I\u2019m not gonna be caught unprepared.\u201d Severe storms to impact High Plains, Northeast and mid-Atlantic Friday As Florida deals with the deluge, a severe thunderstorm threat is ramping up for the Northern and Central High Plains and portions of the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic on Friday. Thunderstorms are expected across parts of Colorado, Nebraska and Kansas beginning Friday afternoon and continuing into the evening, according to the National Weather Service. Large hail and damaging wind gusts are the main threats with any storms in the region through Friday night. Severe thunderstorms in the East are expected to develop over western Pennsylvania Friday afternoon and spread into the Northeast and mid-Atlantic Coast during the evening. Damaging wind gusts are the main threat, but a few storms could also unload hail. Major I-95 cities like Washington, DC, Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York City and Boston could be in the path of strong storms.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/weather/friday-flooding-rain-storm-south-florida/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "world"}}

The severe downpours have also left 2,400 tourists stranded in the northeastern Indian state of Sikkim. Six people died in India\u2019s Sikkim state and another four died from a landslide in neighboring Nepal\u2019s Koshi province, according to officials. \u201cIt\u2019s continuously raining since the past 36 hours \u2026 we have recovered the dead bodies and they have been handed over to the families,\u201d Hem Kumar Chettri, a district magistrate from Sikkim told CNN. At least 45 houses, roads, bridges and infrastructure had been \u201cbadly damaged\u201d by the rainfall, he added. Bordered between Bhutan and Nepal, the northeastern state of Sikkim is known for its scenic Himalayan landscapes, boasting 28 mountain peaks, 21 glaciers and more than 200 lakes. But like any mountainous region,\u00a0it is prone to deadly flash floods and landslides. Last year dozens of people\u00a0died\u00a0after a glacial lake in the state burst following torrential rain and scientists have warned extreme weather will become more frequent and more intense\u00a0as the human-caused climate crisis intensifies. Chettri said approximately 2,400 tourists are\u00a0stranded in various tourist spots in the state after landslides covered roads with debris and heavy rainfall damaged some bridges. \u201cThey are stranded but they are safe, we have spoken with hotel owners to house them till the weather improves, no one is on the roads \u2026 we have advised tourists to stay where they are,\u201d he said. State disaster response forces have been deployed to clear roads. \u201cThe damage is really bad so it will take time but hopefully within a week we will be able to restore connectivity,\u201d Chettri said. India\u2019s Meteorological Department\u00a0said\u00a0\u201coccasional intense spells of rainfall\u201d were very likely to continue over Sikkim on Friday. Neighboring West Bengal state has also been affected by flooding in recent days, with trees uprooted, buildings damaged and high water levels in the Teesta River. While the north grapples with torrential rains, India has endured a record long summer \u2014 with a part of the capital Delhi recording the country\u2019s highest-ever temperature of 49.9 degrees Celsius (121.8 Fahrenheit) last month. Rising temperatures in the country also risk reversing progress on poverty alleviation, health and economic growth.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/india/india-sikkim-landslide-deaths-tourists-stranded-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_15_sport_euro-2024-switzerland-hungary-spain-croatia-italy-albania-spt-intl", "text": "Spain kicked off its Euro 2024 campaign with a statement 3-0 win over Croatia to earn a vital three points in the tournament\u2019s \u2018Group of Death.\u2019 La Roja was out of the blocks rapidly and made Croatia pay for a sluggish start. First-half goals from \u00c1lvaro Morata, Fabi\u00e1n Ruiz and Dani Carvajal \u2013 fresh from scoring in the Champions League final \u2013 opened up a dominant lead that the Kockasti never looked like coming back from. As well as Spain and Croatia, Group B also features defending champion Italy \u2013 all three teams are ranked in the top 10 of FIFA\u2019s world rankings \u2013 and surprise package Albania, which finished top of its qualifying group ahead of Czechia and Poland. It was an uncharacteristically sloppy start for a vastly experienced Croatia side, which has punched above its weight at international tournaments in recent years, reaching the final and then the semifinal at consecutive World Cups. The midfield trio of Luka Modri\u0107, Marcelo Brozovi\u0107\u00a0and Mateo Kova\u010di\u0107 alone boasted 372 caps for Croatia but were largely ineffective throughout. The Croatian defense was pulled apart with ease for the opening goal just before the half hour mark, allowing Morata to run through on goal from Ruiz\u2019s pass and calmly slot the ball past Dominik Livakovi\u0107. That strike moved the 31-year-old up to joint-third on the all-time scoring list at European Championships with seven goals, behind only Cristiano Ronaldo and Michel Platini. The next goal came just three minutes later as Ruiz danced around weak challenges from Modri\u0107 and Brozovi\u0107 on the edge of the area before drilling the ball low into the bottom corner. Carvajal then made it three on the stroke of half-time, timing his run perfectly to slide into the six-yard box and turn Lamine Yamal\u2019s pinpoint cross past Livakovi\u0107. Both teams had plenty of chances to add to the scoreline in the second half, but were thwarted by poor finishing and a brilliant save from Livakovi\u0107 which denied Barcelona youngster Yamal a record-breaking goal. Croatian fans thought they at least had a moment to cheer in the closing stages when Bruno Petkovi\u0107 scored at the second attempt after seeing his initial penalty saved. However, the video assistant referee (VAR) ruled that Ivan Peri\u0161i\u0107 had encroached into the area during the spot kick before he squared the ball back to Petkovi\u0107. It capped a miserable afternoon for Croatia and the team will have to improve dramatically when it faces Albania and Italy to have any hope of qualifying for the knockout stages. Italy vs. Albania Defending champion Italy had to come from a goal behind to earn an unconvincing 2-1 against win against Albania. An early Azzurri error gifted Albania the lead after just 23 seconds, as Nedim Bajrami pounced to score the fastest goal in European Championship history. However, two goals in the space of five minutes from Alessandro Bastoni and Nicol\u00f2 Barella quickly turned the game on its head and Italy was able to hold on for three important points in the \u2018Group of Death.\u2019 Though far from a vintage Italian performance, this team is vastly experienced and knows how to defend a lead and see out a game when it matters the most. Next up will be the far greater challenge of Spain when the two teams meet in a crunch clash on Thursday, with a winner guaranteed a place in the knockout stages. Italy\u2019s night got off to the worst start imaginable when Federico Dimarco\u2019s errant throw-in went straight to Bajrami\u2019s feet, allowing the forward to shift the ball to his right and hammer his effort in at the near post. But Italy found an equalizer only 10 minutes later after poor defending left Bastoni completely unmarked at the far post to head home from Lorenzo Pellegrini\u2019s cross. Barella\u2019s goal five minutes later capped a frenzied opening 15 minutes, hitting a crisp strike past goalkeeper Thomas Strakosha after the ball had bounced around inside the penalty area. The Kuqezinjt\u00eb applied plenty of pressure in the closing stages and Italy had goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma to thank for keeping out Rey Manaj\u2019s effort when the Albania forward was through on goal. It was stoic performance in the second half from Albania, the second-lowest ranked team in the tournament, and the players lined up in front of their fans to soak in the applause in what is only the country\u2019s second appearance at a European Championship. Hungary vs. Switzerland First-half goals from Kwadwo Duah and Michel Aebischer set Switzerland on course for a crucial, hard-fought 3-1 win over Hungary in Group A. Barnab\u00e1s Varga pulled a goal back for a much improved Hungary in the second half, but Breel Embolo capitalized on a defensive error to put the game beyond doubt in stoppage time. It was an uncharacteristically sloppy defensive performance from the Magyars, who qualified for Euro 2024 unbeaten after conceding just seven goals in eight games. Though the team improved as the match wore on, an experienced Swiss side weathered the storm after Varga\u2019s goal gave Hungary some momentum, before Embolo \u2013 whose thigh strapping fell off as he ran through on goal \u2013 coolly lobbed the ball over goalkeeper P\u00e9ter Gul\u00e1csi following Attila Fiola\u2019s errant header. The win puts Switzerland second in Group A behind Germany following Die Mannschaft\u2019s big 5-1 win over Scotland on Friday.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/15/sport/euro-2024-switzerland-hungary-spain-croatia-italy-albania-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_americas_onboard-the-russian-warship-visiting-cuba", "text": "In twelve years of living in Cuba, I have waited in all kinds of lines. Lines to buy food, lines to pay bills, lines just because people were lining up for something maybe worth lining up for. But now I was in a line for something unexpected:\u00a0to\u00a0board\u00a0a Russian warship docked in Havana\u2019s harbor. When a Russian diplomat told me that starting on Thursday, the Admiral Gorshkov frigate would offer tours to the public for three days, I was somewhat skeptical. The Gorshkov is one of the most modern vessels in the Russian fleet, capable of firing hypersonic missiles that travel at more than 6,000 miles per hour. I had trouble imagining that\u00a0President Vladimir\u00a0Putin\u2019s prized\u00a0ship would be opened for anyone to see. When the Gorshkov arrived in Cuba\u00a0on Wednesday, it fired a deafening\u00a021-shot\u00a0salute.\u00a0The\u00a0Cubans answered with cannon fire from an 18th\u00a0century fortress overlooking the harbor that the Spanish had built to protect the city from pirates. With the frigate came a rescue tug, a fuel ship and the Kazan, an imposing nuclear-powered submarine. Cuba\u2019s Ministry of Defense said that none of the ships were carrying nuclear weapons and that they did not represent \u201ca threat to the region,\u201d clearly meaning the US, Cuba\u2019s neighbor 90 miles to the\u00a0north. But for many Cubans, the visit of the largest convoy of ships in years from their old Cold War ally seemed like a return to the past, particularly as Moscow and Washington increasingly spar over the war in Ukraine. \u201cI never thought I would see a Russian submarine so up close,\u201d said a Cuban man next to me as we waited in line in view of the four\u00a0vessels. We were standing outside the port terminal in Havana which,\u00a0just years earlier,\u00a0had been full\u00a0of\u00a0US cruise ships, until then-President Donald Trump banned their visits to the island\u00a0in 2019. Even though a line had formed, it was not clear if any of us waiting there were going to get aboard. An hour passed in the broiling Cuban sun. \u201cWe are roasting out here,\u201d a woman carrying a small baby next to me said. Cubans are champion line-waiters and I worried that I would have nothing to show for my interlude outside the port other than a worsening sunburn. Finally, a Cuban Navy official in a sparkling white uniform came out to speak to us, resting his hand on my shoulder. \u201cYou can go aboard but need to leave any sharp objects like knives, scissors or hair clippers behind,\u201d he said. Two plainclothes\u00a0state\u00a0security officers began to run everyone\u2019s\u00a0identity card numbers through a database on their phones. I handed my\u00a0carn\u00e9,\u00a0or\u00a0ID card,\u00a0that lists my birthplace in the US to one of the officers who appeared too young to shave. He looked at my\u00a0carn\u00e9\u00a0and turned to his older colleague for advice. \u201cAre we letting foreign residents on board?\u201d\u00a0he asked. The older officer,\u00a0who was wearing a New York Yankee\u2019s baseball cap,\u00a0nodded and then ran my card information through the database. \u201cYou can go ahead,\u201d he said. Inside the port, past officials manning a metal detector, Russian sailors in dark blue unforms waited to take a group of about\u00a020\u00a0of us aboard the Gorshkov. In front of the ship, the sailors had posted a sign in English that declared the Gorshkov\u2019s \u201cmain purpose\u201d was \u201ccombat operations against enemy surface ships and submarines.\u201d The Russian sailors spoke more English than Spanish and I occasionally translated to help the other members of our group, who were\u00a0all\u00a0Cuban. We were told we could film and everyone immediately took out their smartphones to snap videos and selfies. We started out on the ship\u2019s massive helicopter pad and then walked through the ship to the bow. Every few feet a Russian sailor stood keeping watch. At the front of the ship, one of the sailors\u00a0showed me an anti-rocket system\u00a0to be used\u00a0in the unlikely event we came under attack. I asked about the massive cannon and the sailor replied that it could fire shells a distance of 23 kilometers,\u00a0or about 15 miles. A level up, where there appeared to be sensitive communications equipment, a Russian soldier in tactical gear with an assault rifle at his side looked down at us. Just off the bow we could see an unobstructed view of the Kazan, the 430-foot long submarine that stretched out into the harbor. I noticed one of the Russian sailors taking in the blue skies and calm waters around us. \u201cCuba good?\u201d I ask him. \u201cCuba good,\u201d he laughs in reply and gives me a thumbs up. The war in Ukraine has\u00a0severely\u00a0degraded the Russian fleet and once again pitted the US and Russia on opposite sides of a bloody conflict. For a Russian sailor, Cuba could be as good as it gets these days. I disembarked the Russian warship in Havana feeling that the Cold War did not seem like such a distant memory, when I saw an alert flash across my phone. It was an announcement that the Pentagon had just dispatched its own nuclear powered attack submarine\u00a0to the other side of the island:\u00a0the US Navy Base in Guantanamo\u00a0Bay,\u00a0Cuba, slightly more than 500 miles away from the where the Russian ships are docked.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/americas/onboard-the-russian-warship-visiting-cuba/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_australia_australia-boy-arrested-deepfakes-schoolgirls-intl-hnk", "text": "Australian authorities are investigating the distribution of deepfake pornographic images of around 50 schoolgirls, allegedly created by a teenager using artificial intelligence. The discovery comes as the federal government pushes for new laws to impose prison sentences on offenders who create and share images made by AI tools to humiliate and denigrate victims. Other countries, including the United States, are attempting to address an alarming rise in deepfake porn, where nude deepfakes of schoolgirls have been created and shared\u00a0 \u2013 in some instances, allegedly by schoolboys. Victoria Police confirmed they had arrested and released a teenager \u201cin relation to explicit images being circulated online\u201d pending further inquiries. The images were reportedly created using photos posted to social media of 50 female students of Bacchus Marsh Grammar, a co-educational school on the outskirts of Melbourne in Victoria. The school\u2019s principal Andrew Neal told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) that the victims were girls in grades 9 to 12, indicating a possible age range of between 14 and 18. The boy\u2019s age and identity are unknown, but Neal told the ABC that \u201clogic would suggest that the [offender] is someone at the school.\u201d Speaking to the ABC on Wednesday, the mother of a 16-year-old female Bacchus Marsh Grammar\u00a0student, whose image wasn\u2019t used, said her daughter vomited when she saw the \u201cmutilated\u201d pictures online. \u201cI went and picked my daughter up from a sleepover and she was very upset, and she was throwing up and it was incredibly graphic,\u201d the mother told ABC Radio Melbourne, giving only her first name, Emily. The school said in a statement that it was offering counseling to the students\u00a0and assisting police with their investigation. \u201cThe wellbeing of Bacchus Marsh Grammar students and their families is of paramount importance to the school and is being addressed,\u201d the statement said. Legal fight to stop deepfakes Social media companies, including X and Meta say all nonconsensual pornography is banned on their platforms, but explicit AI-generated images continue to quickly spread\u00a0online. Last November, New Jersey high school student Francesca Mani, 14, led public demands for a federal crackdown in the US against AI-generated deepfake pornography, saying images of her and dozens of her classmates at Westfield High School had been manipulated. High-profile victims of explicit doctored images include Taylor Swift \u00a0and New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. In March, Ocasio-Cortez introduced federal legislation \u2013 the Disrupt Explicit Forged Images and Non-Consensual Edits Act of 2024 (DEFIANCE Act) \u2013 to give victims the power to sue people who create non-consensual deepfakes of them. However, the bi-partisan legislation, backed by senior Republicans, failed to pass a motion for unanimous consent Wednesday, according to a statement by the Senate Committee on the Judiciary. Victoria is the only Australian state where sharing deepfake pornography is a criminal offense. In 2022, the state government introduced three-year jail terms for using technology to generate or share child abuse material, or sexually explicit material without consent. This month, the Australian government introduced legislation to criminalize the distribution of deepfake pornography nationwide. Under the proposed law, offenders could face up to six years in prison for sharing non-consensual sexually explicit deepfake material. If the offender has also created the deepfake content that is shared without permission, the sentence could rise to seven years in prison. It\u2019s part of the country\u2019s response to gender-based violence that Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has called a \u201cnational crisis.\u201d So far this year, 35 women have been killed, according to the Counting Dead Women project \u2013 many allegedly by current or former partners. Just last month, the state government appointed a Parliamentary Secretary for Men\u2019s Behavior Change, in an Australian first. On his appointment, MP Tim Richardson said he would focus on the impact of the internet and social media on men\u2019s attitudes toward women. In a statement on Wednesday,\u00a0Victoria State Premier Jacinta Allan said the alleged actions of the teenager were \u201cdisgraceful and misogynistic.\u201d \u201cWomen and girls deserve respect in class, online and everywhere else in our community, which is why we have made laws against this behavior and we are teaching respectful relationships in schools to stop violence before it starts,\u201d Allan said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/australia/australia-boy-arrested-deepfakes-schoolgirls-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_tech_spacex-elon-musk-former-employees-lawsuit", "text": "SpaceX and CEO Elon Musk were sued on Wednesday by former employees who claim they were illegally fired for raising concerns about gender discrimination and sexual harassment at the rocket company. The lawsuit, brought by eight employees who were fired in 2022, alleges that Musk wants to be \u201cthe leader to a brave new world of space travel, but runs his company in the dark ages \u2014 treating women as sexual objects to be evaluated on their bra size, bombarding the workplace with lewd sexual banter, and offering the reprise to those who challenge the \u2018Animal House\u2019 environment that if they don\u2019t like it they can seek employment elsewhere,\u201d according to the complaint, filed in state court in California. The eight former employees were involved in writing a 2022 open letter criticizing Musk and urging SpaceX executives to make the firm\u2019s culture more inclusive. The letter, which was signed by at least 400 other employees, asked SpaceX management to make it clear that Musk\u2019s statements \u2014 particularly on Twitter \u2014 did not reflect the views or values of the company and asserted that SpaceX\u2019s so-called \u201cNo A**hole\u201d policy was unevenly enforced. Following the letter\u2019s release, the eight employees were fired. Wednesday\u2019s complaint alleges that \u201cMusk personally ordered the Plaintiff\u2019s terminations.\u201d SpaceX did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit. SpaceX does not typically respond to queries from news organizations. In response to the 2022 letter, SpaceX COO Gwynne Shotwell previously said she would enforce SpaceX\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d standards against employee harassment, but the The New York Times reported that she said the employees had been fired for making other staff feel \u201cuncomfortable.\u201d SpaceX previously faced similar complaints filed to the National Labor Relations Board over the termination of employees involved in the letter. Those complaints claimed that the terminations amounted to employees being fired for engaging in \u201cconcerted protected activities.\u201d One former employee who filed an NLRB complaint and is a plaintiff in the Wednesday lawsuit, Tom Moline, previously told CNN that SpaceX management used an \u201c\u2018ends justifies the means\u2019 philosophy to turn a blind eye to the ongoing mistreatment, harassment, and abuse reported by my colleagues, much of which was directly encouraged and inspired by the words and actions of the CEO.\u201d Earlier this year, SpaceX responded to a consolidated complaint from the NLRB with its own lawsuit, alleging that the structure of the NLRB itself is \u201cunconstitutional.\u201d Wednesday\u2019s complaint details the statements by Musk and the actions of other workers that the fired employees claim contributed to a hostile work environment and \u201cpervasively sexist culture\u201d at SpaceX. It points to multiple crude posts by Musk on Twitter, now called X, such as one containing a plan \u201cto create a Texas university similar to MIT which he would call \u2018TITS\u2019 and where \u2018Ds [women\u2019s bra size] would get degrees,\u2019 accompanied by an altered photo rendering a rocket to appear to be a giant penis,\u201d the complaint states. \u201cThings like that were widely shared on all internal chat channels and talked about in meetings and used as fodder in professional environments,\u201d Paige\u00a0Holland-Thielen, one of the plaintiffs, told CNN\u2019s Laura Coates, adding that employees were \u201cencouraged\u201d to follow Musk on the social media platform. As a result, it became \u201cimpossible to separate his personal nonsense from the actual day-to-day life of an actual working environment,\u201d she said. The complaint also references a post from Musk, shared the day after Business Insider published a report claiming Musk had sexually harassed a flight attendant, in which the billionaire said: \u201cFinally, we get to use Elongate as scandal name. It\u2019s kinda perfect,\u201d along with a laughing emoji. (Musk has\u00a0denied\u00a0the harassment claims.) \u201cMusk\u2019s conduct of interjecting this juvenile, grotesque sexual banter into the workplace had the wholly foreseeable and intentional result of encouraging other employees to engage in similar conduct,\u201d Wednesday\u2019s complaint states. The former employees allege that engineers commonly applied \u201ccrude and demeaning names to products in an attempt at humor, often at the expense of women and LGBTQ+ individuals. For example, the name \u2018Upskirt Camera\u2019 was used for a camera on first stage of the Falcon rocket that views the bottom of the second stage,\u201d according to the complaint. In one instance, a SpaceX HR director responded to allegations of inappropriate workplace behavior at an internal event by saying: \u201cI\u2019ve never been sexually harassed; I must not be hot enough,\u201d the complaint alleges. The lawsuit adds that the former employees believe \u201cSpaceX has not taken action to redress the harassment, hostile work-environment, and retaliation.\u201d The former employees are seeking unspecified monetary damages to account for \u201clost wages, earnings, and other employee benefits, emotional distress.\u201d This story has been updated with additional details and context.

{"id": "2024_06_10_europe_european-elections-explainer-intl", "text": "Results are being announced in the\u00a0European\u00a0parliamentary elections \u2013 one of the world\u2019s biggest democratic exercises \u2013 and a few clear narratives have emerged from the days-long poll. Far-right parties across the continent had strong showings, but their momentum did not cause the center ground of European politics to cave in \u2013 as many had predicted. Instead, liberal and Green groups lost seats and relevance in the European Parliament. Meanwhile, domestic politics was upended in some countries, including France \u2013 where new elections were announced. Here\u2019s what you need to know. Far right makes gains Ahead of the vote, eyes across Europe were fixed mainly on the continent\u2019s far-right parties \u2013 with gains by those groups expected to form a major part of Sunday\u2019s narrative. Those gains did materialize; far-right groups were expected to secure a record number of seats in the European Parliament, dealing a major blow to the continent\u2019s establishment leaders. Far-right parties were set to win around 150 of the parliament\u2019s 720 seats, an exit poll projected, potentially frustrating efforts by mainstream parties to form majorities needed to pass laws. Most of the far-right gains were concentrated in countries that elect large numbers of seats: France, Italy and Germany. But the parties must still work to build a consensus if they are to maximize their political threat. Germany\u2019s AfD is politically homeless: it was removed from the far-right Identity and Democracy (ID) party after its main European candidate, Maximilian Krah, said he did not consider all members of the Nazi group, the SS, to be criminals. Several other far-right parties are among the non-aligned (NI) group, predicted to secure 45 seats. The center holds Despite a far-right surge, the centrist European People\u2019s Party (EPP) was the biggest single winner on Sunday night. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a speech late on Sunday that the group \u2013 predicted to secure the most seats \u2013 could still act as an \u201canchor of stability.\u201d But she called on her political allies to help guard against extremist parties. \u201cThe center is holding. But it is also true that the extremes on the left and on the right have gained support, and this is why the result comes with great responsibility for the parties in the center,\u201d she told an audience in Brussels. Von der Leyen appeared to rule out any possibility of the party banding together with the far-right factions, telling journalists that she will be reaching out to The Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D) and centrist and liberal Renew Europe to form a \u201cbroad majority for a strong Europe.\u201d Von der Leyen, who is seeking a second term as European Commission president, outlined her desire to keep pushing on with parties who are \u201cpro-European, pro-Ukraine, pro-rule-of-law.\u201d National politics in disarray The results massively disrupted politics in several European countries, as gains from previously fringe groups became impossible for some leaders to ignore. French President Emmanuel Macron called a stunning snap election on Sunday after his party was trounced by Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Rally (RN). \u201cI have decided to give you back the choice of your parliamentary future by voting. I am therefore dissolving the National Assembly this evening,\u201d Macron said. The elections to pick a new parliament will take place on 30 June and 7 July. France\u2019s main far-right electoral lists in the European Elections took more than one in three votes cast, according to official results from the French Interior Ministry Monday. France returns \u2013 the European elections list for Marine Le Pen\u2019s RN party \u2013 and the list headed by her niece Marion Mar\u00e9chal won 36.83% of votes cast, more than the next three parties combined. In a celebratory speech at the RN headquarters before Macron\u2019s shock announcement, party leader Jordan Bardella said the \u201cunprecedented defeat for the current government marks the end of a cycle, and Day 1 of the post-Macron era.\u201d Belgium\u2019s Prime Minister Alexander De Croo meanwhile resigned after his party suffered a disastrous defeat in national and European parliamentary elections. The 48-year-old politician struggled to hold back his tears when announcing the decision on Sunday evening in Brussels. \u201cI was the figurehead of this campaign. This is not the result I had hoped for, and I, therefore, take responsibility for this result. It was not meant to be,\u201d De Croo told journalists. Meloni and Tusk have good nights Few major EU leaders enjoyed results night, but Italy\u2019s Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni saw her party make gains, and ended the process as a major player in European politics. Her domestic party, Brothers of Italy, was the most rightwing to be elected to government in Italy since that of Benito Mussolini, the wartime fascist leader. But Meloni has proven a pragmatic figure in Europe, becoming an ally of von der Leyen, and a staunch supporter of Ukraine, while pushing the bloc to take a firmer stance on migration. Those efforts could accelerate after Brothers of Italy won the country\u2019s vote. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Donald Tusk\u2019s efforts to make Poland a force in Brussels were boosted after his party held off the populist opposition Law and Justice (PiS) group to secure an outright victory. Tusk has rebuilt Warsaw\u2019s reputation at the European table after defeating PiS in a national election last October. The former European Council President made reintegration with Europe a key pillar of his campaign and his time in office, while the strategic significance of Poland to the bloc has increased following Russia\u2019s invasion of neighboring Ukraine. Brussels\u2019 mainstream leaders will also be relieved that Hungary\u2019s authoritarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, for so long a thorn in the EU\u2019s side, was dealt a blow on Sunday. His party Fidesz suffered its worst European election results to date, ceding ground to its center-right opponents. Greens fall back As fringe parties on the right made gains, left-wing groups, and in particular the Greens, were squeezed across Europe. Early results showed that Green support in France and Germany suffered especially huge drops in seats. \u201cThe losses in Germany and France are obviously a blow,\u201d Bas Eickhout, the Greens/EFA vice-president and lead candidate of the European Green Party, admitted in a statement as results came in. The group insisted they would work to push the new parliament to prioritize work on the climate, but their standing is severely diminished and it remains to be seen how much Europe\u2019s leaders will need to rely on their support. The European Commission announced one of the world\u2019s most ambitious goals to slash planet-heating pollution in February, but faces opposition in rural areas around the continent, with farmers\u2019 unions saying the plans represent a threat to their livelihoods.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/europe/european-elections-explainer-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_25_style_zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk", "text": "Above Beijing\u2019s imperial center rises Jingshan, or Prospect Hill. From a pagoda at its modest peak, a panoramic view of the city presents itself. To the south, the dull golden roofs of the Forbidden City crest and fall, pulling the eye southward to Tiananmen \u2014 the Gate of Heavenly Peace \u2014 and the vast square of the same name just beyond. To the east stand the smooth metallic skyscrapers of the city\u2019s business district. To the north, at the top of Beijing\u2019s central axis \u2014 its so-called dragon\u2019s vein \u2014 sit the Bell and Drum Towers, which once acted as the city\u2019s collective timepiece. And stretching all along the western periphery are the calm, tree-lined waters of the manmade lakes, dug by hand for the pleasure of past emperors. It\u2019s this aerial view of \u201cZhongnanhai,\u201d meaning \u201cmiddle and southern seas,\u201d and the surrounding buildings that today\u2019s Chinese leaders prefer you did not see. That\u2019s because the 1,500-acre site of repurposed imperial pavilions and temples, along with gray modern offices has formed the leadership compound for the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP)  since 1950. As the seat of power, Zhongnanhai is often thought of as China\u2019s equivalent to the White House, or the Kremlin. Synonymous with China\u2019s communist party elite, and among the country\u2019s most secretive places, it is ringed by a centuries-old red ochre wall, with countless CCTV cameras periscoping above it \u2014 and patrolled assiduously by security forces in both plain clothes and uniform. A peaceful getaway For Chinese leader Xi Jinping\u2019s imperial forebears, the site served a somewhat different function. While emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties ruled their vast kingdom from within the Forbidden City, they built temples, halls and living quarters in Zhongnanhai; less grandly ceremonial than those of the palace, they were often oriented to take advantage of the views afforded by the area\u2019s tranquil waters and carefully planned gardens. Many of these emperors came to favor passing their days surrounded by drooping willows in the cool and quiet of this cultivated pleasure garden. A story relayed by the scholar Geremie Barm\u00e9 in his book \u201cThe Forbidden City\u201d tells of the 18th-century Qianlong Emperor\u2019s daily routine at Zhongnanhai: Each morning, after a first breakfast of cold swallows nest soup, he would travel by heated palanquin to the gardens\u2019\u00a0Studio of Convivial Delight,\u00a0a pavilion he built to capitalize on the view of the South Lake, where he would breakfast again on a meal of\u00a018 dishes. As the historian and author of \u201cThe Shortest History of China,\u201d Linda Jaivin, told CNN via email: \u201cThere is something outrageous and yet poetic about the incredible coordination and effort required of a team of bearers, cooks and attendants, just so that an emperor could come, catch a view of the magnificent Ocean Terrace, scoff his food and (leave).\u201d The first ruler to view Zhongnanhai as primarily a place to govern from, not simply relax in, was the Empress Dowager Cixi, who effectively controlled China for almost five decades from 1861. She lived for many years in the gardens\u2019 Hall of Ceremonial Phoenixes, which became the center of political authority in China. She would die there in 1908. The serene surroundings of Zhongnanhai also became, under Cixi, a place of punishment and confinement. In 1898, following attempted reforms that displeased her, Cixi imprisoned her nephew, the Guangxu Emperor, on Yingtai Island, which juts out into the southern lake. Built as a miniature version of the mythical Penglai island, home to the immortals of Chinese legend, the tiny piece of land would become the emperor\u2019s home for most of his life, bar a brief period when the Boxer rebellion of 1900 forced the whole court to flee the capital. He would die on Yingtai Island from arsenic poisoning the day before the Empress Dowager herself. His imprisonment and death, said writer M. A. Aldrich, author of \u201cThe Search for a Vanishing Beijing: A Guide to China\u2019s Capital Through the Ages,\u201d perhaps adds a touch of poignancy for any subsequent resident of Zhongnanhai. \u201cIn addition to being a site that preserves sites of imperial splendor,\u201d he told CNN, \u201cit also functions as a reminder to the political elite about the consequences for stepping out of line.\u201d For Aldrich, however, the Zhongnanhai compound also represents the destructive impulses of the CCP towards its adopted capital in the years after 1949, when Mao Zedong proclaimed the foundation of the People\u2019s Republic. \u201cAs a political symbol of the New China, it has been torn up, rebuilt, expanded, and revamped so many times that its connection with its elegant past has been lost,\u201d Aldrich said. Architectural changes There have been serious revisions to the architecture of Zhongnanhai since the end of imperial rule in 1912. After the last emperor abdicated the throne, China\u2019s new president Yuan Shikai granted him the right to live on the northern section of the Forbidden City \u2014 and then took Zhongnanhai to be his new administration\u2019s headquarters. The changes he made to the imperial gardens were disparaged by many of the Westerners who visited them. \u201cWhatever may be one\u2019s opinion as to whether Yuan Shikai \u2018exalted his aim\u2019 in his political career, he certainly cannot be said to have done so as builder and architect,\u201d wrote L.C. Arlington and William Lewisohn in their 1935 book \u201cIn Search of Old Peking,\u201d \u201cfor all the buildings that have been erected or restored by him are in the worst possible taste.\u201d Most notable of these changes \u2014 at least to ordinary Beijingers \u2014 was the repurposing of a two-story pavilion at the very south of the gardens. Known as the Precious Moon Tower, it had been built decades earlier by the Qianlong Emperor for a homesick lover, a Muslim woman from Xinjiang, taken to Beijing as part of the spoils of war. The concubine would gaze south from the tower toward a mock mosque and bazaar the emperor had especially constructed to assuage her longing for home. Yuan refashioned this pavilion into the main entrance to his presidential compound, and established a tall watchtower just to its east. The gate was named Xinhuamen, or the Gate of New China. Today, the structure remains coated in the same deep red that graces the walls of all Beijing\u2019s imperial buildings, with a roof of glazed yellow tiles and detailing that runs below the roofline, picked out in blue and gold. The gate is now flanked by two red banners that speak to its modern purpose as China\u2019s political and party headquarters: \u201cLong Live the Great Communist Party of China\u201d reads one; and \u201cLong Live the Invincible Mao Zedong Thought\u201d on the other. On a screen wall recessed behind the entrance way, Chinese characters written in Mao\u2019s own calligraphic style declare: \u201cServe the People.\u201d Facing out onto Beijing\u2019s main east-west thoroughfare, the gate remains the most conspicuous part of Zhongnanhai. The rest of the compound has, since 1989, been firmly off-limits to the Chinese public. Seat of power Initially, after the communist victory in China\u2019s civil war in 1949, Mao Zedong took up residence at Shuangqing Villa in Fragrant Hills, another former imperial garden to the west of Beijing. Though wary of establishing himself in the imperial heart of Beijing \u2014 it is said that he refused ever to enter the Forbidden City, for fear of being associated with the power structures of old, feudal China he had fought to overthrow \u2014 Mao ultimately moved into Zhongnanhai and, in late 1949, he set up in the\u00a0Garden of Abundant Beneficence,\u00a0a large courtyard compound favored by both the Qianlong and Kangxi emperors, where he would hold court with dignitaries\u00a0and live\u00a0until 1966. Having re-established Zhongnanhai as a center of political power in the new China, Mao set about rebuilding the compound according to his tastes. \u201cSince 1949, an assortment of new architecture styles has encroached into Zhongnanhai, with a tennis court, gymnasium, swimming pools and Western buildings topped off with Chinese eave roofs adding a discordant note that would not have been appreciated by its traditionally-minded original owners,\u201d said Aldrich. In 1966, Mao moved from the Garden of Abundant Beneficence to a specially built house beside his beloved indoor swimming pool. He often summoned officials to speak to him as he bobbed in the water \u2014 and famously received Russian leader Nikita Khrushchev at his pool during a 1958 visit. \u201cTheir interpreters had to pace alongside the edge of the pool,\u201d said Jaivin. \u201cThe Russian couldn\u2019t swim and had to wear water wings. Mao loved both swimming and putting Khrushchev in his place. Finally, Khrushchev got sick of it, and clambered out to sit on the edge, dangling his feet in the water.\u201d In the residence next door, Mao lined his rooms with bookshelves housing an extensive library of Chinese classical literature. \u201cIt was here,\u201d noted Aldrich, \u201cwith the background trappings of a scholar, that he met Nixon and Kissinger in 1972.\u201d Most subsequent leaders have preferred to keep a house outside the Zhongnanhai compound. Deng Xiaoping lived, from 1977, in a courtyard house on a nearby lane adjacent to Beihai, the \u201cNorthern Sea\u201d of central Beijing\u2019s chain of lakes. While not officially disclosed, it is believed that more contemporary leaders, including Xi Jinping and his predecessors Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, have maintained homes in an exclusive gated compound in Jade Spring Hill, sometimes called the \u201cback garden\u201d of Chinese politics, out to the city\u2019s west. Aldrich noted that those leaders and party cadres who used Zhongnanhai as their primary residence often attracted unwelcome scrutiny for their activities, particularly during years of political turbulence. \u201cIn his memoirs, Chairman Mao\u2019s physician, Li Zhisui, commented that (the complex\u2019s) residents were always under surveillance,\u201d Aldrich said. \u201cDuring the Cultural Revolution, the simple act of making a fire would bring down the wrath of the security guards on the perpetrator. It was believed that such a fire was proof that incriminating or seditious materials were being destroyed.\u201d The imperial gardens offering vistas of Zhongnanhai\u2019s lakes have, today, been filled in with dozens of gray offices and meeting halls, many of which date to 1970s, when Zhongnanhai underwent significant razing and renovation \u2014 the rebuilding was so extensive that one visitor in 1979 described the grounds resembling a construction site, with muddy roads that were impossible to walk on. The contemporary compound splits roughly in two, with the northern buildings, on the banks of the \u201cmiddle lake,\u201d used as the headquarters of China\u2019s top executive body, the State Council. It is here that foreign dignitaries are admitted. Around the \u201csouthern lake,\u201d meanwhile, are the headquarters of the CCP, including, within Qinzheng Hall (the Hall of Diligent Government), the offices of the general secretary of the party (a post currently held by Xi). Many of the most historically significant political events to occur at Zhongnanhai have taken place in Huairen Hall, or the Hall of Cherished Compassion, on the western side of the Middle Lake. The hall was added to the imperial park during the late Qing dynasty, but was then extensively remodeled by the CCP in the early 1950s to impart a more august socialist grandeur. It is a broad, imposing ceremonial hall with staggered roofs of glazed green tiles falling in curved lines to upturned corners; the facade of austere grey brick is interrupted by red wooden pillars, windows and doors. The building\u2019s capacious interior houses a large auditorium, as well as numerous smaller meeting rooms. The hall has, for decades, served as the main meeting place for China\u2019s Politburo, the party\u2019s decision-making body usually comprising about two dozen members. On occasion, it has also hosted the Politburo\u2019s Standing Committee, the core of China\u2019s political elite, (the power of both bodies has notably dwindled in the era of Xi), though they most commonly meet in Qinzheng Hall, close to the general secretary\u2019s office. During the tumult of the Cultural Revolution vital discussions and debates occurred at Huairen Hall, and, in the months after its conclusion, it was there that three of the so-called Gang of Four \u2014 the political faction that included Mao\u2019s wife held responsible for the worst excesses of the era \u2014 were arrested, tricked into attending a meeting they thought was about the publication of the fifth volume of Mao\u2019s Selected Works. In April 1989, former party head Hu Yaobang suffered a heart-attack during a Politburo meeting at Huairen; his death a week later would trigger the Tiananmen Square protests that the government forcibly cracked down on in early June of that year. However, the compound hasn\u2019t always been so forbidden for the masses following the collapse of China\u2019s imperial dynasty. In the late 1920s, it became a park, with tourists allowed to boat on and swim in the lakes, while in the 1980s, the public could access some of its scenic and historical spots, including\u00a0Mao\u2019s\u00a0former residence, on\u00a0organized weekend tours.\u00a0Even early in 1989, a journalist for the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0was able to casually\u00a0drive\u00a0a senior official into the compound and drop him off inside.\u00a0During a period of warmer US and China relations in 2011, former Chinese president\u00a0Hu Jintao\u00a0invited\u00a0a group of American high school students to Zhongnanhai. Modern security concerns Today, Zhongnanhai is more closely-guarded than ever, though the inexorable development of the city has caused problems in maintaining the compound\u2019s secrecy. When an annex to the nearby Beijing Hotel was built in\u00a01973, authorities were panicked by the realization that from its upper floors one could quite easily see \u2013 and potentially target a sniper rifle \u2013 into Zhongnanhai. A building was hastily erected on the western edge of the Forbidden City to restrict this view. Likewise in 2018, when Beijing\u2019s new tallest building was\u00a0completed\u00a0\u2013 the 528-meter Citic tower, better known as the \u201cZun\u201d \u2013 the country\u2019s national security apparatus reportedly requisitioned the top floors amid fears that visitors or occupants might be able to spy into the compound. Beijing authorities did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on the security situation at the time. Zhongnanhai\u2019s entrance, Xinhuamen, has also been the site of repeated demonstrations in recent decades; in 1989, it was a gathering point for students taking part in the Tiananmen protests, whilst in 1999, more than 10,000 members of the since-banned Falun Gong gathered on the sidewalks near Zhongnanhai to protest their treatment at the hands of the government. So, while Zhongnanhai is sometimes compared to the White House, Aldrich argues that the paranoia with which the compound is today guarded makes it more like the imperial palace of centuries past: \u201cSince ordinary people are not allowed to enter Zhongnanhai, it is probably more appropriate to describe it as a \u2018New Forbidden City\u2019 for China\u2019s ruling elite rather than a place with a personal political resonance for the average citizen,\u201d he said. \u201cHeck, even the Kremlin is open to tourists!\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/style/zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "world"}}

In an AI category at the 1839 Awards\u2019 Color Photography Contest, judged by industry leaders at Christie\u2019s, Phaidon and the Centre Pompidou, Astray pulled off an act of feathery subterfuge, sneaking in an entry of a real photo of a flamingo he took while in Aruba. Like AI images, which can bear hallmark signs of wonky anatomy, like too many teeth or fingers, the flamingo appeared headless as it bent its neck to scratch itself with its beak. To Astray\u2019s surprise, it won both third place in the category \u2014 and the People\u2019s Vote award. \u201cTo see it get shortlisted by the jury was a surprise in that it\u2019s always a bit of a lottery in such big contest. There are just so many excellent pictures competing,\u201d Astray told CNN over email. \u201cAfter it got shortlisted\u2026 I thought I might really have a shot and started campaigning for people\u2019s votes, but I had absolutely no idea how far or close I was to winning until the announcement.\u201d After the winners were revealed, the photographer notified the organization that runs the 1839 Awards, Creative Resource Collective, and took to social media to reveal his trickery. \u201cI entered this actual photo into the AI category of 1839 Awards to prove that human-made content has not lost its relevance, that Mother Nature and her human interpreters can still beat the machine, and that creativity and emotion are more than just a string of digits,\u201d Astray wrote. \u201cThere were ethical concerns, of course, so I was hoping that the jury and the audience would find that this jab at AI and its ethical implications outweighs the ethical implications of deceiving the viewer, which, of course, is ironic because that is what AI does.\u201d Astray was subsequently disqualified from the competition, with the director of Creative Resource Collective, Lily Fierman, explaining in a statement to CNN that \u201ceach category has distinct criteria that entrants\u2019 images must meet\u2026 we don\u2019t want to prevent other artists from their shot at winning in the AI category.\u201d Fierman said there\u2019s \u201cno hard feelings,\u201d and that their team plans to work with Astray to publish a conversation around the state of AI-generated images, using his entry as a \u201cjumping-off point.\u201d \u201cWe hope this will raise awareness (and send a message of hope) to other photographers who are worried about AI,\u201d she added. Creative Resource Collective did not comment on how their AI and non-AI photography categories are judged and vetted. As for the flamingo, Astray emphasized it was a serendipitous moment, not one that he sought out. \u201cI was not actively looking for a picture that would work for this stunt,\u201d he explained to CNN. \u201cRather, the idea had been roaming in some remote corner of my mind, more subconsciously than consciously I think, and when I saw this picture, it surfaced. It is simply the perfect shot for this because the scene is so unreal and for such a simple, natural reason: a flamingo scratching its belly.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/style/flamingo-photograph-ai-1839-awards/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_06_10_europe_france-macron-gamble-far-right-vote-intl-cmd", "text": "It was a stinging blow and a shocking parry. French President Emmanuel Macron saw his party fall into second place in European Parliament elections in France on Sunday, with the two main far-right parties together taking close to 40% of the vote. When Jordan Bardella, the leader of the far-right National Rally party, called on Macron\ufeff to dissolve the French national parliament on Sunday night, it seemed like political posturing, riding high on his victory in European polls. \u201cThe President of the Republic cannot remain deaf to the message sent by the French this evening,\u201d he told supporters. Macron called his bluff. Announcing a snap national election for the end of June, Macron has set up a showdown between his pro-European, centrist and pro-Ukrainian ideals and the anti-immigration, populist and hard-line law-and-order rhetoric of the far right. \u201cThe extreme right is both the impoverishment of the French and the downgrading of our country. So, at the end of this day, I cannot act as if nothing had happened,\u201d he told the country in a televised address Sunday. Calling the far right\u2019s bluff Macron will try to rally the right and left, urging their supporters to come together and vote against the far right, but there\u2019s no knowing if it\u2019ll pay off. The first round of voting will take place in 20 days, a tiny window in which to form a coalition from the mosaic of France\u2019s centrist and left-wing parties. There appears to be little appetite to join forces with Macron on the left, bruised after years of largely fruitless protests against his pro-business agenda, and torn apart from the inside by divisions over the war in Gaza. The last time a French president dissolved the country\u2019s lower house, the National Assembly, was in 1997. Jacques Chirac lost his majority, and the left came to power. In an interview Monday morning, French Foreign Minister Stephane S\u00e9journ\u00e9 said that Macron\u2019s Renaissance party was open to withholding candidates from contesting the seats of potential allies in other parties. S\u00e9journ\u00e9 told Radio France that the party would discuss such a move with \u201creasonable people with whom we can work.\u201d On Sunday night, the popular French far-left party France Unbowed (LFI) appeared to have already ruled itself out of such a move. \u201cIt is now clear that the country wants to turn the page on the Macron era. And this page must not be turned with the National Rally and the far right,\u201d Manon Aubry, leader of the LFI European list, which came fourth in the European vote in France, told supporters. LFI figurehead Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon said that he saw no reason to unite with other parties on the left, especially with the narrow window to form a coalition. Such a proposition by Macron\u2019s party is no doubt a sign of weakness, a far cry from Macron\u2019s 2017 landslide second-round victory over far-right presidential candidate Marine Le Pen \u2013 and a sign of the times, his party wounded by memories of the \u201cyellow vest\u201d protests, an unyielding Covid-19 regime, and unpopular pension reforms. Since parliamentary elections held at the beginning of his second term in 2022, Macron has been ruling without an absolute majority in parliament, ordinarily unable to pass bills with his lawmakers alone. Instead, he invoked article 49.3 of the constitution several times to push legislation through parliament without a vote. This has stoked yet more anger against Macron and further division in France, especially given the contentious nature of his hike in the pension age to 64. Dueling visions The far-right National Rally, spearheaded by Le Pen, the long-time doyenne of France\u2019s anti-immigration camp, currently holds 88 to Macron\u2019s bloc\u2019s 250 seats in the 577-seat French parliament and, in theory, the upcoming election is far from a two-horse race. The appeal of the far-right\u2019s anti-immigration stance is no doubt magnified on the European stage \u2013 where EU lawmakers have long struggled to stem illegal immigration flows. At a national level, Bardella and Le Pen will have to rely on a broader spectrum of policies, doing battle with Macron\u2019s economic record, which has mostly shielded France from the inflation woes suffered by Europe. However, it\u2019s clear that this election will be a duel between Macron and Le Pen. French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire admitted Monday morning that his party held some responsibility for Sunday\u2019s results. He made his objective for the campaign clear. \u201cThis will be project against project; National Rally against ours,\u201d he told French radio network RTL. The French foreign minister described the call for elections as a \u201cbet of confidence\u201d in the French people by Macron, with the president trusting they will hold the line against political extremes. France\u2019s voting system plays in Macron\u2019s favor. In the first round of ballots, a variety of parties will compete to meet a minimum threshold of votes. The second round on July 7 will see the highest-polling candidates in each seat run off if no one wins an absolute majority. This could see voters of different stripes banding together to oppose a candidate from the far right. This mechanism also applies to the presidential election, which has ensured no far-right victory at the Elysee Palace thus far. On a more local scale, it may not be such a security. Ultimately, the June 30 and July 7 votes will determine how Macron spends his last three years in power. What comes next? What\u2019s certain is that Macron \u2013 with a presidential mandate until 2027 - will remain president no matter what. If his gamble pays off and he wins back a majority in parliament, he\u2019ll be able to move ahead with reforms and govern as he likes: changes to end-of-life care and the education system are in his crosshairs. It\u2019ll give him precious breathing space and a clear mandate for his agenda at home and abroad. In his words, \u201cIt\u2019s a time of indispensable clarification.\u201d \u201cThe rise of nationalists and demagogues is a danger not only for our nation, but also for our Europe and for France\u2019s place in Europe and the world,\u201d Macron said Sunday in his address to the nation. But the prospect of a lame-duck presidency looms large. If his bloc, currently with 250 of the 577 MPs in the National Assembly, fails to meet the 289-seat threshold for an absolute majority but remains the largest, his government will again have to wage legislative battle with one hand tied behind its back. If his nightmare comes true and the far-right movement replicates its European results on the national stage, he will be forced to appoint a prime minister from its ranks \u2013 most likely the 28-year-old Bardella, current president of National Rally. In a \u201ccohabitation,\u201d Macron would deal with international and defense issues, while Bardella would hold sway over the domestic agenda. Party figurehead Le Pen would likely wait in the wings to contest the 2027 president election against Macron\u2019s successor. The constitution prevents him running for a third term. \u201cWe are ready to be in power,\u201d she said in her Sunday night victory speech. In a country increasingly polarized by populist rhetoric, Ya\u00ebl Braun-Pivet, speaker of France\u2019s National Assembly struck a lonely note Monday morning as she called for greater cross-party cooperation. \u201cIn France we don\u2019t manage to get past partisan quarrels,\u201d she said in an interview with broadcaster France 2. Macron\u2019s reputation has been founded on bold, political moves. But if he fails to hold back the far-right this month in the coming weeks, his legacy will be the gamble that let the far right into power.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/europe/france-macron-gamble-far-right-vote-intl-cmd/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "world"}}

Pope Francis hosted the equivalent of a \u201cconclave of comedians\u201d by inviting Whoopi Goldberg, Jimmy Fallon, Chris Rock, Stephen Colbert, Conan O\u2019Brien and others to Rome. Over 200 people were in the audience, with more than 100 comedians from 15 countries. The 87-year-old pontiff is known for his sense of humor. He likes to crack jokes with people he meets, often telling them with a smile: \u201cplease pray for me\u2026 not against me!\u201d He has repeatedly emphasized the importance of having a sense of humor, saying it is something that he prays for each day. \u201cA sense of humor lifts you up, it shows your life is short and to take things in the spirit of a redeemer,\u201d Francis once said in an interview. \u201cIt is a human attribute, but it is the closest to God\u2019s grace.\u201d Francis\u2019 meeting on Friday with\u00a0\u201cartists from the world of humor\u201d\u00a0is part of his latest attempt to engage with contemporary culture, with the Vatican explaining in a statement that the meeting underlines how the \u201cart of comedy can contribute to a more empathetic and supportive world.\u201d It follows on from his\u00a0landmark visit to the Venice Biennale\u00a0and his meeting last year with\u00a0artists and directors in the Vatican.\u00a0The meeting also comes with the pope facing question marks over his outreach to\u00a0LGBTQ+ Catholics\u00a0after reportedly using a homophobic slur at private meetings. Others from the US contingent include Tig Notaro, Jim Gaffigan with several Catholics among them: both Gaffigan and Colbert identify as Catholics while Fallon and O\u2019Brien were both raised in the Catholic Church. Also due to attend is Julia Louis-Dreyfus who told CNN\u2019s Christiane Amanpour that she had\u00a0\u201cno idea\u201d\u00a0what to expect. Fr.\u00a0James Martin, a Jesuit priest sometimes dubbed \u201cThe Colbert Report\u2019s Chaplain,\u201d was also due to attend the meeting and Colbert\u00a0talked about the upcoming papal audience on his show. \u201cPope Francis is going to meet me at the Vatican!\u201d he joked. \u201cAm I excited?

{"id": "2024_05_02_style_aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl", "text": "Miami has a new addition to its skyline \u2013 a 66-story residential tower built by Aston Martin, marking the British luxury sports carmaker\u2019s first foray into the residential real estate market. Comprising of 391 units, Aston Martin Residences Miami sits at the mouth of the Miami River on Biscayne Bay, the firm said in a statement Tuesday. Designed in partnership with architect Rodolfo Miani of Bodas Mian Anger and built by G&G Business Developments, the 249-meter- (818-foot-) tall building houses seven penthouses, each with private pools and terraces, as well as apartments ranging in size from one to five bedrooms. The largest unit is the \u201cUnique Triplex Penthouse,\u201d arranged over three floors at the top of the building, which remains on the market for $59 million. The property was officially opened on Tuesday. Timed to coincide with the Formula One Miami Grand Prix, the company said in a statement that it marks \u201cthe latest distinct expression of Aston Martin\u2019s ultra-luxury high performance brand.\u201d Featuring an infinity pool with a pool deck, jacuzzis and cabanas on the 55th floor, the sail-shaped complex has a two-floor fitness center, two movie theaters and a virtual golf simulator. The building has a sky bar and lounge, chef\u2019s kitchen, ballroom and private dining areas, as well as a spa, beauty salon and barber shop. Direct access to the sea via a superyacht marina is also available, plus a private butler service. Germ\u00e1n Coto, chief executive officer of G&G Business Developments, told CNN Tuesday that the firm wanted to work on a project in the \u201ccosmopolitan city\u201d of Miami, and that this piece of land was the perfect choice. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing plot with an excellent view of the river,\u201d said Coto. The structure\u2019s aerodynamic shape helps the building deal with the technical challenges presented by high winds in the area, as well as evoking the sleek shape of an Aston Martin, according to Marek Reichman, executive vice president and chief creative officer of Aston Martin. It also becomes wider from the base to the mid-section before tightening once more towards the top, making it appear to bow out over people on street level, Reichman told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the drama,\u201d he added. Challenges However, the process wasn\u2019t all plain sailing. \u201cIt was difficult to achieve what we wanted because the space and the plot is kind of small,\u201d said Coto, with the building fitting into a 1.25-acre plot of land. Meanwhile, local building regulations imposed strict standards, explained Reichman, taking into account the low-lying land and propensity for flooding. \u201cThey were some of the most amazing challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to withstand the flooding with the windows that are on street level.\u201d There were further obstacles due to the curved shape of the building, which means that units on the east side have an individual architectural structural component. Aston Martin touches Homeowners are able to customize their interior space with the help of the Aston Martin design team, with three style packages \u2013 Timeless, Covert and Indulgent \u2013 drawing on the company\u2019s British heritage, as well as the building\u2019s context. \u201cIt needs to have part of the DNA of an Aston Martin,\u201d Reichman said. \u201cBut we are in Miami, you don\u2019t have a cold November evening where you need to put the log fire on, so you\u2019ve got to be considerate of the environment that you\u2019re in.\u201d Design elements running through the building include doors with bespoke Aston Martin handles, number plinths and kestrel tan leather door tabs. Aston Martin said that 99% of the properties sold before the building was completed. Residences were sold for $1.5 million to $8.5 million, while penthouses ranged from $16 million to $59 million. The Unique Triplex Penthouse, on the market for $59 million, comes with the last remaining Aston Martin Vulcan, an 820 brake horsepower all-carbon fiber supercar, of which only 24 exist, a spokesman for the company said. Meanwhile, buyers of the 47 Signature and Penthouse units were also able to choose between an Aston Martin DBX sports SUV or the company\u2019s DB11 sportscar. Aston Martin isn\u2019t the first luxury carmaker to enter the residential property market. A 63-story building from Bentley will open in 2026 along the coastline of Sunny Isles Beach, Florida. Featuring 216 units, the property will have an elevator designed to take residents up to their doorstep while seated inside their cars.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/02/style/aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "world"}}

There\u2019s the Art Deco curved crown of the Chrysler Building, the sweeping isosceles triangles that twist around One World Trade Center, the stepped limestone and granite rectangles of the Empire State Building and the triangular prism of the Flatiron Building. And now, a multi-billion-dollar tower featuring floor-to-ceiling glass will add another dimension to the cityscape, according to new details unveiled by New York City Mayor Eric Adams this week. Stretching up 62 stories, a planned office tower at 350 Park Avenue will provide space for more than 6,000 jobs, plus 1.8 million square feet of commercial office space, according to a press release. It will be funded by Vornado Realty Trust, Kenneth Griffin, founder and CEO of global investment firm Citadel, and building and management company Rudin. White columns will frame a new public concourse at the base of the new building on Park Avenue, complete with green space, seating and art displays, images show. Above, landscaped terraces will top each section of the glass-clad tower which will house the offices for Citadel and market making firm Citadel Securities. Adams hailed the project in the release, saying it will help \u201csupercharge our economy and expand New York City\u2019s iconic skyline,\u201d building on \u201ccontinued efforts to energize Midtown Manhattan as the world\u2019s most important business address and an economic engine for working-class New Yorkers.\u201d Architects Foster + Partners have designed the building, which will replace the existing 30-story tower currently at the site in Midtown Manhattan just a few blocks away from landmarks like the Rockefeller Center, St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral and Grand Central Station. As New York continues to deal with the economic aftershocks wrought by the Covid-19 pandemic, Adams and his administration said in their respective statements that they hoped this project would continue the city\u2019s recovery. \u201cThis investment opens a new chapter for Midtown \u2014 and closes the book on those who predicted its demise,\u201d said deputy mayor for operations Meera Joshi. \u201cMidtown\u2019s revitalization is being led by its public realm \u2014 including investments in Fifth Avenue, with the crown jewels of Central Park and Bryant Park at either end. Together, with our business improvement district and parks partners, we are reintroducing Fifth Avenue to the world and creating a vibrant live, work, play community for a new era,\u201d Joshi added. Building this new office space comes at a fraught time for the commercial real estate market as businesses struggle to entice workers back to the office after years of working from home. This has left vast tranches of office space vacant or underused, causing the value of such buildings to plummet at the same time as historically high interest rates have made it harder for real estate developers \u2014\u00a0who often take out huge loans to finance projects \u2014\u00a0to make good on their repayments. The project will begin the city\u2019s public review process early next year and the tower is expected to be completed by 2032, according to the release.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/20/style/park-avenue-skyscraper-new-york-skyline-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_10_asia_north-korea-trash-balloons-south-korea-loudspeakers-intl-hnk", "text": "North Korea sent a new wave of trash-laden balloons toward its southern neighbor late Sunday, after Kim Jong Un\u2019s powerful sister warned of further responses if the South keeps up its \u201cpsychological warfare.\u201d The new balloons, which Seoul has previously slammed as \u201cbase and dangerous,\u201d come in apparent retaliation for the decision by South Korea to resume broadcasting anti-North Korean\u00a0propaganda over loudspeakers in border areas. Kim\u2019s sister and government spokeswoman Kim Yo Jong warned the resumption of loudspeaker broadcasts was \u201ca prelude to a very dangerous situation.\u201d In a statement carried by North Korean state media, Kim said South Korea would be subject to an unspecified \u201cnew counteraction\u201d\u00a0from the North if it continued with the loudspeaker broadcasts and failed to prevent activists from\u00a0sending anti-North Korean propaganda leaflets over the border. \u201cI sternly warn Seoul to stop at once this dangerous act,\u201d Kim said, adding that Seoul is creating a \u201cnew environment of crisis.\u201d South\u00a0Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS)\u00a0has maintained North\u00a0Korea\u00a0is \u201cfully responsible\u201d for the current situation and urged the North to \u201cimmediately stop such mean acts like sending waste balloons.\u201d In a statement Monday, a JCS spokesman would not say whether the South would continue to broadcast over the loudspeakers, noting only that\u00a0the military would conduct missions \u201cwith flexibility according to the strategic and operational situation.\u201d The escalating tit-for-tat has sparked concerns of potential retaliatory military action. Last week, the South Korean government suspended a 2018 deal\u00a0to reduce military tensions with the North, allowing it to resume propaganda broadcasts and potentially restart military exercises along the border. South Korea\u2019s military once routinely deployed propaganda broadcasts as a means of psychological warfare against the North, until it withdrew the equipment following the 2018 deal. The broadcasts inform North\u00a0Korean soldiers and residents of the \u201creality of North\u00a0Korea,\u201d and the development of\u00a0South\u00a0Korea, and modern Korean culture, according to the JCS. Tit-for-tat balloons In recent weeks, the North has floated more than a thousand trash-filled balloons across the heavily fortified border, in what it claims is a response to the years-long practice among South Korean activist groups of sending\u00a0balloons with anti-North Korea leaflets in the other direction. As of Monday morning, the South Korean military had found \u201caround 50 balloons\u201d that fell into its territory overnight Sunday. Many other balloons are believed to have flown back into\u00a0North\u00a0Korea due to the wind, according to the JCS spokesman. On Thursday, South Korean activists sent balloons across the border toward the North, carrying hundreds of thousands of leaflets condemning leader Kim Jong Un and 5,000 USB sticks containing K-pop and K-dramas. For decades, North Korea has been almost completely closed off from the rest of the world, with tight control over what information gets in or out. Foreign materials including movies and books are banned, with only a few state-sanctioned exceptions; those caught with foreign contraband often face severe punishment, defectors say. Earlier this year a South Korean research group released rare footage that it claimed showed North Korean teenagers\u00a0sentenced to hard labor\u00a0for watching and distributing K-dramas. Restrictions softened somewhat in recent decades as North Korea\u2019s relationship with China expanded. Tentative steps to open up allowed some South Korean elements, including\u00a0parts of its pop culture,\u00a0to seep into the hermit nation \u2013 especially in 2017 and 2018, when relations thawed between the two countries. But the situation in North Korea deteriorated in the following years and diplomatic talks fell apart \u2013 prompting\u00a0strict rules to snap back\u00a0into place in the North.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/asia/north-korea-trash-balloons-south-korea-loudspeakers-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "world"}}

Prolonged, record-breaking heat is on the way for an area of the country that has largely avoided it so far, wildfire risks are rising in parts of the West and bathtub-warm water could fuel the first tropical depression of the Atlantic hurricane season. Heat dome to bring intense heat wave for millions Heat arrived in the eastern half of the country Friday, but it\u2019s just an appetizer of what\u2019s to come. An expansive and exceptionally strong heat dome builds Sunday over the East and expands to reach the Midwest and Great Lakes over the following days, ushering in the regions\u2019 first significant heat wave of the year. Heat domes trap air in place and bake it with abundant sunshine for days on end, making each day hotter than the last. This one will make temperatures skyrocket to levels hotter than even the hottest typical summer day. Hundreds of temperature records could fall by the end of next week, both during the day and at night. Temperatures will top out 15 to 20 degrees above normal over a huge portion of the eastern half of the country Monday afternoon, but surge even higher to reach 25 degrees above normal at times from Tuesday through Friday. This translates to days of high temperatures well into the 90s for tens of millions of people who don\u2019t typically bake in long-lasting heat. Relief from the heat won\u2019t be found at night, which is another symptom of a warming world. Overnight low temperatures aren\u2019t expected to drop below the low 70s or upper 60s in many locations. To make matters worse, humidity will work in tandem with extreme heat to send the heat index \u2013 how heat feels to the human body \u2013 to dangerous triple digits in parts of the East. Heat index values in the low 100s are possible as far north as Maine next week. The health risks from heat will reach extreme levels for millions next week, according to a scale from the National Weather Service and CDC. Heat is the deadliest form of weather in the US, killing more than twice as many people each year on average as hurricanes and tornadoes combined. First signs of tropical trouble are brewing The Atlantic hurricane season looks ready to awaken at the same time intense summer heat bakes a significant portion of the country. There are two short-term risk areas that could produce the first tropical system of the year, and both are a little too close to the US coast for comfort. An area in the southwestern Gulf of Mexico has the highest chance to become the first tropical system. There is also a small window and a low chance the same stormy pattern driving Florida\u2019s rain could develop into a tropical depression off the Southeast coast before it gets swept out to sea this weekend. Robust tropical moisture is swirling in the southwestern Gulf because of the Central American gyre: A large, disorganized area of showers and thunderstorms that rotates over Central America and its surrounding waters. The gyre\u2019s broad spin and abundant moisture can help tropical systems form in parts of the Caribbean, the Gulf of Mexico and even the extreme eastern Pacific Ocean when other necessary factors \u2013 including favorable upper-level winds and warm ocean water \u2013 align. That could be the case by midweek; the National Hurricane Center says there\u2019s a medium chance a tropical depression could form in the Bay of Campeche in the southwestern Gulf. Most of the Gulf of Mexico is bathtub-warm, so if a tropical system manages to form it would have plenty of fuel to strengthen. If something does form, it\u2019s likely to track north or northwest. Regardless of tropical development, a surge of moisture like the one behind the deluges in South Florida will provide much-needed wet weather to parts of Mexico that have been baking under extreme heat and brutal drought for weeks. But it will also raise the flood risk along the Gulf Coast, especially in areas soaked this spring. Multiple days of rain are heading for the Gulf Coast from Texas to Alabama starting Sunday and continuing throughout the week. Wildfire risk growing Heat isn\u2019t just making us sweat and giving hurricane season a boost \u2013 it\u2019s also had a hand in several recent notable wildfires. Fire activity is increasing gradually nationwide, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. Almost a dozen large fires are burning in parts of the West and half of these started in recent days. Hot, dry conditions in place since early in the month in the West will continue to increase wildfire risk and could worsen ongoing fires. Wildfire fuels like grass and plant life will continue to dry out during this time, making them more prone to fire ignition or spread. Winds will also kick up in the region later this weekend and early next week. Gusty winds cause wildfires to spread quickly, as the Corral Fire demonstrated in California at the start of June. Breezy conditions could also spell trouble next week for a small, but destructive fire in Arizona, about 70 miles northwest of Phoenix, dubbed the Rose Fire. The fire destroyed at least 15 structures \u2013 seven of which were homes \u2013 along with at least a dozen vehicles, the Arizona Department of Forestry and Fire Management said Thursday. The fire had burned through at least 166 acres since igniting Wednesday, but was only 20% contained as of Thursday evening.

{"id": "2024_06_14_world_catan-new-engeries-game-universe-cec", "text": "For many people, games are an escape into a world of fun and fantasy. It may come as a surprise, then, that the newest edition of a popular board game deals directly with a timely issue that\u2019s not quite so fun: the climate crisis. Catan, a game about collecting and using resources such as bricks and lumber to build and expand settlements in a fictional world, turns 30 next year. While the company has since released numerous versions and expansions \u2014 and sold more than 45 million copies worldwide \u2014 its latest edition, Catan: New Energies, is one of the biggest departures for the game so far. Instead of gameplay set in pre-industrial times, New Energies is set in the 21st century, with real elements such as power plants and pollution playing a major role. In many ways, it makes sense for a game about the rapid expansion of humanity to explore the effects of the climate crisis. After all, industrialization caused it. You may not expect a game about the climate crisis to be fun \u2014 or to be backed by deep research on the intricacies of the topic. But the developers of New Energies worked hard to balance joyful play with environmental science. And they\u2019re not the first. More games are tackling the climate crisis In fact, climate change \u2014 or elements often related to it \u2014 is popping up in more games as the topic becomes increasingly prevalent in news reports and cultural conversations. The popular empire-building video game \u201cCivilization 6\u201d released an expansion titled Gathering Storm in 2019, which was almost wholly centered around climate. In Gathering Storm, players\u2019 actions such as burning coal have major repercussions \u2014 rising sea levels and more frequent natural disasters such as tornadoes \u2014 which affect gameplay. \u201cTerra Nil,\u201d a popular world-building strategy game released in 2023, sees players transform a barren wasteland into an inviting paradise through the use of technology such as wind turbines and \u201ctoxin scrubbers.\u201d This was the same year the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released a report saying we had a very small window in which to \u201csecure a livable and sustainable future for all.\u201d \u201cClimate change is an ever-growing problem \u2026 it makes sense that the most popular media in the world would also reflect these growing challenges,\u201d Rachel Kowert, a research psychologist who specializes in games, tells CNN. This is, says Kowert, because \u201cgames reflect culture.\u201d Adding climate crisis elements to games can also make the topic more accessible, Kowert says. \u201cIt adds that element of playfulness and fun. It makes it a social activity,\u201d she says. \u201cNot many people are going to sit down and read documents on climate change, but people love Catan.\u201d Catan: New Energies rewards players for using renewable energy In New Energies, the basic gameplay of gathering resources to build settlements is the same as in the traditional version of Catan. But in this version, there are additional cards, pieces and mechanics that introduce climate crisis elements. Instead of just building roads, towns and cities, players must build fossil fuel or renewable power plants to gather energy. But their choices carry consequences. If a player builds a fossil fuel power plant, for example, the level of greenhouse gasses in the game increases \u2014 indicated on the board itself with a little marker. When this happens, the potential for climate-related events in the game, such as flooding or air pollution, also increases. These climate events can block resource production for players and therefore their ability to expand their settlements and win the game. It can also trigger the early end of the game, in which case the player with the most renewable power plants wins. Players can add green discs to the bag \u2014\u00a0which can give players using renewable energy bonuses \u2014 by building renewable power plants. This also brings down the global carbon footprint on the tracker, so fewer discs need to be removed from the bag each turn. Adding climate elements into Catan certainly makes it more complicated to play. But this also reflects the reality of our world. Even experts struggle to reach a consensus on the best solutions to mitigate climate change. The game is based on real environmental science While Catan: New Energies was released on June 14 of this year, the game has actually been in development since 2011. It started with a scenario called Oil Springs based on managing oil resources, which was pitched to the Catan team by Erik Assadourian, a researcher at the Worldwatch Institute, a sustainability think tank. In the Oil Springs scenario, players could use oil to expand more rapidly \u2014 with the added potential to cause flooding of the Catan world. \u201cAt its heart, Catan is a growth story,\u201d says Assadourian. \u201cWithout recognizing the limits to growth, that\u2019s a problem.\u201d The Oil Springs scenario, paired with WWF\u2019s 2050 climate solutions report, inspired the idea of a Catan that deals with electricity as a resource, says Benjamin Teuber, game designer and Managing Director at Catan GmbH, who created New Energies with his late father, Catan creator Klaus Teuber, who died in April 2023. When development on New Energies started in 2011\u00a0there were three renewable energy sources:\u00a0wind, water and solar. This, among other things, made it \u201cvery complicated,\u201d says Teuber. Development of the game was shelved until the Covid-19 pandemic hit, when Benjamin Teuber and his father had more free time to revisit the idea. Immediately, solutions to the original gameplay problems started presenting themselves, Teuber says. To ensure the game\u2019s climate science was still within the bounds of reality, Assadourian came on board as a consultant for New Energies toward the end of its development in 2022. He also wrote an almanac about climate at the back of the rulebook to build out the game\u2019s thematic background. \u201cYou can only do so much when you\u2019re constrained by the simplicity of game mechanics,\u201d Assadourian tells CNN. In real life, \u201cNo renewable energy power plant is going to be a minus one pollution point.\u201d Instead, Assadourian hopes the game will show people how we can transition from the current energy and economic system we\u2019re in to a sustainable and regenerative one. The first step to that is reducing energy use. Even the physical materials for New Energies were chosen with the climate in mind. \u201cWhen you\u2019re creating a physical consumer product, it\u2019s impossible to have no impact, but we focused on how we can lessen the environmental impact,\u201d says Kelli Schmitz, the Director of Brand Development at Catan Studio. \u201cThe English printing of New Energies is printed and assembled in the United States using cardboard and wood from sustainable sources.\u201d Its makers hope the game will inspire people to act Before the design of New Energies wrapped in December 2022, outside playtesters were asked to provide feedback on the game. After all, it wouldn\u2019t work if the game was too complex or not fun to play. \u201cPeople liked it because nobody felt that we pushed our opinion on them,\u201d says Teuber. \u201cThey were like, \u2018Oh, I can actually grow quite well with fossil (fuels). Do I like this? I don\u2019t know.\u2019 \u201cWe wanted to really make this feel like a simulation, if you will, of reality. And for that reason, it\u2019s important that you can win with fossil (fuel) energy. It would be bad, I think, if we just balanced it in a way that it\u2019s impossible because then you give the wrong message \u2014 you don\u2019t give the message of reality. The more real it feels, the more serious people will talk about it.\u201d Many of the playtesters had to question their morality and make decisions based on it, says Teuber. \u201cThey said, \u2018It\u2019s fascinating, because I really wasn\u2019t sure what to do. I had this moral thing, but I wanted to win the game.\u2019\u201d In real life, almost everyone has an opinion on what we could do as a society to reduce the effects of the climate crisis. But few of us are in a position to make changes on a global scale. Having the power to improve the health of the planet, even in a board game, can be empowering. \u201cThe fun thing about games is there\u2019s enough detachment that you can engage with this big, scary concept in this big, varied space,\u201d says Kowert, the research psychologist. \u201cAnd then maybe at the end of it, come out with a greater understanding of what you can actually do, what power you have.\u201d If players come away from New Energies having philosophical discussions about our climate and trying to make little changes in their lives, the game will have done its job, says Teuber. \u201cThe game itself won\u2019t change the world, but it maybe enables you a little bit in thinking, \u2018Oh, I maybe have more power to make things change.\u2019\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/world/catan-new-engeries-game-universe-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_tech_apple-openai-partnership", "text": "When OpenAI CEO Sam Altman attended Apple\u2019s annual developer conference this week, he walked the campus, mingling with current and former executives, including Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak. Nearly an hour later, the iPhone maker announced a much-rumored partnership with OpenAI to bring its ChatGPT technology to devices later this year. But Altman, who has emerged as the poster child for generative AI in the 18 months since the launch of ChatGPT, was not featured in Apple\u2019s formal presentation, neither in person or via livestream. Nor did he join Apple CEO Tim Cook and other executives in a private press event about privacy and security and the partnership between the two companies. \u201cI was not surprised Sam Altman did not appear on stage,\u201d said Ben Wood, an analyst at market research firm CCS Insight in an interview with CNN. \u201cApple had to manage the message carefully. OpenAI is merely the vehicle to address broader AI-powered inquiries that are not core to the Apple experience. Having him in the livestream would have only created an unnecessary level of confusion.\u201d Earlier this week, Apple showed off a handful of AI-powered features coming to the iPhone, iPad and Mac in the fall \u2013 the majority of which are fueled by the company\u2019s own proprietary technology, called Apple Intelligence. The company will offer OpenAI\u2019s viral ChatGPT tool in a limited capacity, usually only when Siri is activated and needs more assistance answering an inquiry. The move to invite Altman to the announcement but not have him appear before the public also represents in some ways how Apple is cautiously moving forward with the partnership. OpenAI, along with other AI companies, continues to face concerns from researchers, industry experts and government officials around misinformation, biases, copyright, privacy and security, and more. The deal also comes at a time when the industry is moving quickly, and government regulators, companies and consumers are still figuring out how to engage with the technology responsibly. Apple hopes that a big push into AI could spur growth for iPhone sales as the device has languished without a major upgrade for years and users are now waiting longer to upgrade their devices as a result. An uncertain economic environment is also weighing on consumers, particularly in China. The company also faces regulatory scrutiny in Washington and was recently passed by chip maker Nvidia as the second-largest public company in the US. In the 60 hours after Apple\u2019s Monday event, however, the company\u2019s stock price (AAPL) rose by as much as 10%, boosting Apple\u2019s market capitalization by more than $300 billion, rocketing past Nvidia and putting Apple back in contention with Microsoft for largest market value. The timing is further noteworthy: Apple is not always first to adopt and integrate emerging technologies \u2014 it typically researches, develops and aims to perfect new tech for years before including it in new products \u2014 but the speed at which the world is adopting generative AI is perhaps expediting the company\u2019s need to have a smartphone with the latest buzzy technology. \u201cApple needed to deliver an AI story and Apple Intelligence should help placate nervous investors and reassure them that Apple is keeping pace with its rivals,\u201d Wood added. \u201cThe partnership with ChatGPT is a major development which beefs up Apple\u2019s AI offerings, and new features like a significantly improved Siri will be welcome to users.\u201d But the partnership could also open Apple up to some vulnerability, as it has no control over OpenAI\u2019s models or what it does with user inputs. Apple alignment with a company and a technology that have yet to win public trust could also cause some challenges down the road. A limited partnership Although Apple has been working on its own AI program for years, a partnership with OpenAI marks a way for it to fill in the competitive gaps. When a user has a question beyond Siri\u2019s scope, ChatGPT can step in. In the demo following the keynote, Apple showed CNN how someone could upload a picture of vegetables at a farmer\u2019s market and ask what they could make for dinner. Siri may suggest that the question is better suited for ChatGPT, and provide the user with a prompt to give consent to use the service. Apple using ChatGPT as a complimentary service could potentially cut down on risks associated with the company. It\u2019s also very possible Apple could partner with other AI companies in the future too, such as Google\u2019s Gemini or more niche providers with certain expertise, such as in healthcare. \u201cI think Apple will take a pragmatic approach to the OpenAI partnership,\u201d Wood said. \u201cIf Apple finds that the relationship with OpenAI starts to affect the overall user experience or worse, create challenges around security and data integrity, it might look to add further guardrails, or find other ways to deliver AI-powered content.\u201d A focus on privacy and security Apple has been vocal about how it intends to keep user data private and secure when using its own proprietary technology, noting most AI functions will be done on the phone and inputs will be kept away from a far-off server cloud. \u201cAs we look to build in these incredible new capabilities, we want to ensure that the outcome reflects the principles at the core of our products, it has to be powerful enough to help with the things that matter most to you,\u201d Cook said during the keynote. \u201cIt has to be intuitive and easy to use. It has to be deeply integrated into your product experiences.\u201d \u201cAnd, of course, it has to be built with privacy, from the ground up,\u201d he added. Apple said it will not share any personal user information with OpenAI, so inquiries made through ChatGPT won\u2019t be linked to an Apple user\u2019s account. And the repeated consent prompt to require users to opt into using ChatGPT with Siri is noteworthy too; each time Siri wants to kick over a question to ChatGPT, it\u2019ll ask for permission first. Wood believes the consent prompts and other guardrails that Apple is implementing \u201creflect its nervousness.\u201d Meanwhile, Reece Hayden, a principal analyst at ABI Research, told CNN that Apple\u2019s approach is smart because it provides customers with a choice of how to deal with their data. \u201cBy providing a phased approach that blends ChatGPT and native capabilities, users will worry less about the partnership,\u201d he said. \u201cApple can also continue to highlight their own AI capabilities and mitigate some of the risks of being associated with OpenAI, which remains in a state of flux.\u201d Industry concerns Companies like OpenAI have acknowledged the serious risks posed by AI \u2014 from manipulation to a loss of control that could potentially result in human extinction \u2014 but many experts, researchers and AI employees believe they should be doing more to educate the public about risks and protective measures. Just last week, a group of OpenAI insiders demanded that artificial intelligence companies be far more transparent about the concerns over the technology they\u2019re building. So it came as no surprise when some industry watchers, including Elon Musk, were quick to react to Apple\u2019s partnership with OpenAI. In a post to X Monday, Musk said he would ban Apple devices at his companies \u2014 which include Tesla, SpaceX and X, among others \u2014 if the iPhone maker went ahead with its AI plans. If Apple \u201cintegrates OpenAI at the (operating system) level,\u201d Musk said that would constitute \u201can unacceptable security violation.\u201d Although concerns over how employees are using AI models is a topic of worldwide discussion at the moment across many industries, Gartner analyst Annette Zimmermann said Musk\u2019s reaction is a bit misdirected and the topic is not specific to iPhones. \u201cAny employee with a smartphone should follow company policies and not enter any private information into the open domain of ChatGPT,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is not specific to the iPhone \u2026 or Tesla.\u201d Andrew Cornwall, senior analyst at Forrester, told CNN he thinks it\u2019s unlikely that Apple users will become loyal to ChatGPT, as many people won\u2019t use the service unless the iPhone maker can\u2019t provide an appropriate response. \u201cWhen users do query ChatGPT, Apple will track the prompts and gather metrics to improve its own models,\u201d he said. \u201cApple may switch providers or even use more than one third party \u2014 until it has mastered its own model. At that point, Apple will shut the garden gate.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/tech/apple-openai-partnership/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "world"}}

In a video statement released on Tuesday, prosecutor Karim Khan said the ICC has an active investigation into possible atrocity crimes being committed at present in Darfur. \u201cI am extremely concerned about allegations of widespread international crimes being committed in al-Fashir and its surrounding areas, as we speak,\u201d Khan said, adding that his office was investigating those allegations \u201cwith urgency\u201d.

Khan called for anyone with possible evidence, video or audio material to submit it to his office. Al-Fashir, in the Darfur region of northwestern Sudan, is home to more than 1.8 million residents and displaced people, and is the latest front in a\u00a0war\u00a0between the Sudanese army and the RSF which began in April 2023.

{"id": "2024_06_14_americas_colombia-chiquita-banana-intl-latam", "text": "The execution of banana plantation worker \u201cDavid\u201d\u00a0by right-wing Colombian paramilitary\u00a0members\u00a0in 1997 was as swift as it was brutal. Minutes after his bus was\u00a0stopped at a checkpoint in the coastal region of Urab\u00e1, he was dragged off, beaten to death in front of his fellow passengers, and dumped on the side of the road \u2013 where his killers covered his corpse with a\u00a0banana plant.\u00a0Cows would later feed on his body, according to court documents. The brutality did not end there. His\u00a0daughter and\u00a0sister-in-law\u00a0disappeared weeks later, never to be found again. Death threats were made to another member of the family. What was left of the family soon left Urab\u00e1 for good. He\u00a0was just one of thousands of people targeted by the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia, or AUC, an infamous right-wing terrorist group that, at the height of Colombia\u2019s civil conflict around the turn of the century, was able to mobilize tens of thousands of fighters. More than a quarter century\u00a0later, a landmark civil case in a US federal court this week found banana company Chiquita Brands International liable for financing the\u00a0paramilitary\u00a0group, and ordered Chiquita\u00a0to pay $38.3 million in compensation to \u201cDavid\u2019s\u201d family and those of\u00a0seven other victims \u2013 whose real identities were concealed in court documents. The details of those deaths, which took place between 1997 and 2004, and accounts of\u00a0the impact they had on the families, were read to jurors before\u00a0they deliberated whether Chiquita \u2013 one of the world\u2019s largest banana producers \u2013 had acted \u201cas a reasonable businessperson\u201d by paying the AUC what the company characterized as extortion payments. The families\u00a0argued\u00a0that\u00a0payments from Chiquita to the AUC had helped to prop up the paramilitary group\u2019s violence in Colombia and that the company should therefore be held liable for the group\u2019s murders. The verdict\u00a0has been celebrated as a legal breakthrough.\u00a0According to the lawyers who won the case in Florida, it marks \u201cthe first time an American jury has held a major US corporation accountable for complicity in serious human rights abuses in another country.\u201d \u201cI feel great joy, we waited for so long and suddenly, we won. I had almost lost hope, but God helped us,\u201d one of the plaintiffs told CNN after the ruling. The mother of four daughters\u00a0recalled telling\u00a0the court how her partner\u00a0was\u00a0killed by AUC paramilitaries on November 14, 2003, to pressure the family to sell a banana plantation at below market rate. \u201cI don\u2019t want the money myself, I\u2019ll be gone soon\u2026 but at least, for the girls: may they get some justice now!\u201d she said of the compensation. A bellwether case? The verdict follows a nearly two-decade judicial fight by the families, who sued Chiquita International after a separate court case in 2007.\u00a0In\u00a0that case,\u00a0the company admitted paying $1.7 million in \u201cprotection money\u201d to the AUC \u2013 at that time considered a Foreign Terrorist Organization by the State Department \u2013 and agreed to pay the US government a $25 million fine. However, it\u2019s unlikely to be the last of the matter, and not only because Chiquita has already said it will appeal the verdict. Marco Simons, general counsel for Earth Rights International, a human rights NGO that provided legal assistance to the victims, described his legal strategy as a \u201cbellwether process,\u201d with his team selecting the nine strongest cases they had from over 4,500 complaints. He now hopes many more cases will follow. \u201cIt\u2019s been an honor to represent these victims for the past 17 years. It\u2019s not over yet, but this is a significant step forward, and we hope that this will pave the way for compensation for all the victims,\u201d Simons told a press conference in Washington on Tuesday. Because of Chiquita\u2019s appeal, Simons says it is unlikely any of the victims will receive compensation soon, however, he says the case has sent a strong message to corporations about the need to respect human rights. \u201cUltimately, this money is not going to replace what\u2019s been lost. We\u2019re still talking about horrific abuses that these families have suffered, but the money is important because, unfortunately, the language that corporations understand best is money. Sometimes it takes a significant monetary penalty to change corporate behavior,\u201d Simons said. \u2018Tragic for so many\u2019 Chiquita has maintained in its defense \u2013 both throughout the latest case and in previous litigation \u2013 that it was itself a victim, as it had been forced to pay the AUC protection money. While that argument was not enough to\u00a0convince\u00a0the jury that it had acted \u201cas a reasonable businessperson would have acted under the circumstances,\u201d the company told CNN following the latest verdict that it remained \u201cconfident that our legal position will ultimately prevail.\u201d \u201cThe situation in Colombia was tragic for so many, including those directly affected by the violence there, and our thoughts remain with them and their families. However, that does not change our belief that there is no legal basis for these claims,\u201d the statement read. In its 2007 case against the US Justice Department, the company\u00a0admitted making more than \u201c100 payments to the AUC totaling over $1.7 million.\u201d\u00a0Chiquita recorded the AUC payments as \u201csecurity services,\u201d though the company never received any actual services from these payments,\u00a0according\u00a0to a US Justice Department press release from the time. Eric Holder, who represented Chiquita in the 2007 trial before serving as US Attorney General under President\u00a0Barack Obama, told the court then\u00a0that: \u201cThe company had to pay a variety of terrorist groups for over 15 years because those were the groups that controlled the areas in which the company operated. Not the Colombian government.\u201d However, in that trial, the company ended up admitting in a plea deal that it had willingly continued to pay the AUC even after the group was declared a terrorist organization by the US government in 2001, and even after a senior director lodged an objection to Chiquita\u2019s board reiterating \u201chis strong opinion to sell our operations in Colombia,\u201d due to the protection money issue. Federal attorneys found that Chiquita made $49.4 million in profit from their Colombian operations between 1997 and 2004. A time of \u2018real terror\u2019 The AUC was founded in 1997, during one of the most tragic phases of the Colombian civil conflict, which saw the government wrestle for control against left-wing guerrilla forces, right-wing paramilitaries, and criminal organizations. Around that time, left-wing guerrillas from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and the National Liberation Army (ELN) were moving against the state and terrorizing the civilian population.\u00a0Chiquita said in the 2007 case that it had paid ransoms to the FARC and ELN\u00a0before it turned to the AUC in 1997. Faced with the possibility of an armed communist revolution in the country, Colombian landowners and right-wing sympathizers created groups of\u00a0vigilantes\u00a0to respond to the guerrillas blow for blow. The AUC were once such a\u00a0group and spent the years before their final demobilization\u00a0in 2006 terrorizing the population of northern Colombia to stem the rebellion. At its zenith, the AUC could mobilize tens of thousands of fighters, and was heavily financed by drug trafficking: following demobilization, more than a dozen AUC leaders were extradited on drug charges to the US. \u201cI remember that period, it was real terror,\u201d one of the plaintiffs awarded compensation on Monday told CNN. \u201cMy husband was killed, but my daughter was also raped, you had victims all across town.\u201d In other testimony heard by the jurors in the most recent court case, a minor\u00a0girl\u00a0was forced to watch from a taxi as her mother and stepfather were executed on the side of the street, before being given the equivalent of less than a dollar to return home and survive as an orphan. Colombia today Colombia today is a vastly different country to the one in which the AUC was born. A few years after the demobilization of the AUC, a peace deal in 2016 also brought to an end the 52-year conflict between the government and the FARC, though some dissidents continue to fight. Both right wing paramilitaries and left-wing guerrillas have since been included in transitional justice processes aimed at bringing closure to some of the darkest pages of the conflict. Yet the fear in Urab\u00e1 remains. Some of the AUC\u2019s former members remain at large and have joined a new organized criminal group, the Gulf Clan, that challenges government control in northwestern Colombia. Rights groups say powerful corporate interests continue to collude with local politicians and criminal groups to repress activism, particularly in defense of the environment, which can be a dangerous business in South America. Even so, for at least some of the many victims of the AUC, this week\u2019s court verdict is a reason for optimism.\u00a0One of the plaintiffs who spoke with CNN asked to share her message as an act of defiance. \u201cMy daughter, my son, they\u2019re all \u2018Mom don\u2019t pick up the phone, mom don\u2019t talk.\u2019 But hey, fear can only last until someone decides to speak,\u201d she said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/americas/colombia-chiquita-banana-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "world"}}

The painting depicts Jesus, Mary and Joseph resting on their way to Egypt after learning that Herod, King of Judea, wanted to kill the young Christ. Titian, whose real name was Tiziano Vecellio, made the work in the first decade of the 16th century, at the beginning of his career. Measuring just 18.25 inches by 24.75 inches (46.2 centimeters x 62.9 centimeters), the painting is tiny compared with some of the massive works for which Titian became known later in his life. The oil-on-canvas work has a remarkable history. After changing hands among various European aristocrats, the painting was looted by Napoleonic troops during the French occupation of Vienna in 1809 and taken to Paris. It was returned to Vienna in 1815 and again moved through private collections before ending up with John Alexander Thynne, 4th Marquess of Bath, in Wiltshire, England. In 1995, it was stolen from Longleat, the home of Thynne\u2019s descendants, and disappeared for seven years, before it was found at a bus stop in London by art detective Charles Hill. \u201cThis is a painting, then, that has been coveted by aristocrats, archdukes and emperors alike: prized for its vividly coloured scene of familial affection within the natural world,\u201d Christie\u2019s said in the statement. \u201cLike its subjects,\u00a0The Rest on the Flight into Egypt\u00a0has been on a long and eventful journey \u2014 a journey that\u2019s far from over.\u201d The painting will be offered as part of the Old Masters Part I auction at Christie\u2019s in London on July 2.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/style/titian-painting-auction-scli-intl-gbr/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "world"}}

While the state is no stranger to drenching rain, heavy rain events are getting even heavier as the world warms\u00a0due to fossil fuel pollution. Ongoing flooding resulting from past rainfall is one of the main reasons the flood risk is so high Thursday. Floodwaters haven\u2019t had time to fully recede and some communities in and north of the Miami metro remained underwater Thursday morning, aerial imagery showed. That was the case in Hallandale Beach \u2013 located just north of Miami \u2013 where nearly 20 inches of rain had fallen, and some mobile home parks were still underwater, said Broward County Sheriff\u2019s Office Fire Rescue Battalion Chief Michael Kane. Severe flooding there on Wednesday covered cars up to their windshields, forcing some drivers to abandon their stalled-out vehicles and wade to safety. Others had to be rescued. \u201cWe had to use our boats to rescue people standing on top of the roofs of cars,\u201d Kane told CNN. Kane\u2019s office received 175 calls for help in Hallandale Beach alone. Resident Kait Madrigal spent five hours stuck in her car Wednesday after it became suddenly surrounded by floodwaters on her way to work near Hollywood, Florida, she told CNN. She was able to park on the sidewalk to get to higher ground but began to panic as the water rose and cars began to stall out around her. \u201cIf I was to open my car door, I would\u2019ve just had a ton of water rushing in. I would\u2019ve been out of luck big time,\u201d the 25-year-old said. After hours of unrelenting rain, Madrigal waded through the water and was able to find a possible exit route. Fearing she may become trapped all night, she drove out and was able to get home safely, she said. Several local officials have warned against trying to drive through murky floodwaters and are urging storm-weary South Floridians to stay home. Most flood-related drownings occur when cars unknowingly drive into deep water, the Florida Department of Highway Safety said. Fort Lauderdale, where the mayor declared a local state of emergency, received its entire average June rainfall of around 9.5 inches in just 24 hours Wednesday. Miami International Airport and Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport led the nation with the most flights canceled or delayed Wednesday, with more than 1,200 disruptions. The air travel woes are expected to continue through the end of the workweek. In Broward County, the severe storms prompted school officials to postpone the demolition of the Marjory\u00a0Stoneman\u00a0Douglas High School building where a gunman killed\u00a017 people in 2018. Many South Florida residents had only just finished repairing their homes after catastrophic flooding in April 2023, only to find water lapping at their doorsteps Wednesday. Anna Rysedorph, a resident of the Broward County neighborhood of Edgewood, prepared for the worst as water circled her ankles in her home. \u201cI put the dogs in, I\u2019m all packed up. I pretty much got everything in bins and we\u2019re ready to go,\u201d Edgewood resident Anna Rysedorph told CNN affiliate WSVN Wednesday. \u201cMy husband\u2019s like \u2018Don\u2019t panic, don\u2019t panic,\u2019 but you know, I\u2019m not gonna be caught unprepared.\u201d Significant flood risk Thursday Multiple rounds of torrential downpours fueled by a firehose of tropical moisture from parts of the Caribbean are drenching the southern Florida Peninsula on Thursday. Friday will also be another drenching day for South Florida, even as the robust tropical moisture fueling the soaking storms slowly starts to shift out of the area. All told, multiple locations could end up with more than two feet of rain Tuesday through Friday. Wet weather is likely to continue over the weekend, just not to the severity of the past several days. But even the light-to-moderate rainfall rates of typical June showers and thunderstorms could cause additional flooding issues and prevent ongoing flooding from receding. If there\u2019s any silver lining, it\u2019s the rain is beneficial to areas suffering through drought. Half of Florida is experiencing abnormal dryness or drought conditions, with the worst drought centered in the bull\u2019s-eye for the heaviest rain, according to the\u00a0US Drought Monitor. CNN\u2019s Sara Smart and Jamiel Lynch contributed to this report.

There was no Tiger Woods teeing off on Saturday, which perhaps doesn\u2019t come as a great surprise these days, after he missed the cut \u2013 but others failed on the fast and firm greens too, such as Phil Mickelson, Dustin Johnson, Justin Thomas, Viktor Hovland, Justin Rose, Rickie Fowler, Webb Simpson and Jason Day, to name a few. Major winners, all-time greats and two of the world\u2019s top 10 struggled on the North Carolina course on the first and second day. Even world No.1 Scottie Scheffler \u2013 a man who had made at least one birdie in his last 168 rounds \u2013 toiled, though at five-over overall he did just make the cut. The most recognizable name on the list of absentees this weekend is Woods, though it has been a number of years since the 48-year-old was a contender at majors. He shot 74 and 73 to finish seven-over overall. The 15-time major champion made it to the weekend at the Masters but has now missed the cut at successive majors after falling away at the PGA Championship last month. When asked by CNN\u2019s Patrick Snell if he might have played his last US Open, Woods cast doubt on his future at the tournament and also at the Open Championship in the UK. World No.5 Hovland missed the cut by a shot with his six-over overall, while world No.10 Homa also saw his championship end early. According to the US Open, some players are drawing \u2018X\u2019 on their yardage book on the holes they should not miss the green, given how difficult some are playing. Former world No.1 and two-time major winner Thomas was 11-over overall, but even further behind him on the leaderboard was Mickelson on 15-over overall. Australian Day, a former world No.1, seemed comfortably on course to play beyond the halfway stage, but a dreadful final nine in his second round, where he shot a 41 \u2013 carding five bogeys and double bogey in his second round - saw him drop to eight over.

In a news briefing Tuesday, the South Korean military\u00a0appeared to downplay the significance of the gunfire, saying the North Korean soldiers quickly retreated and\u00a0did not appear to have the intention of invading the southern side, based on information that cannot be made public. \u201cThere were no unusual movements other than the North Korean army immediately moving north after our warning shots,\u201d said Col.

Kim Yo Jong, the powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, late Sunday warned the resumption of loudspeaker broadcasts was \u201ca prelude to a very dangerous situation\u201d and that South Korea would be subject to an unspecified \u201cnew counteraction\u201d from the North if it continued with the action.

The incident Sunday marked the first instance of gunfire within the DMZ since 2020, when there was an accidental exchange of shots between the two Koreas, said Lee, the Joint Chiefs spokesperson. Lee said the North Korean troops headed back across the Military Demarcation Line (MDL) that runs down the center of the DMZ after the warnings. The shots did not cross over the MDL to the North Korean side of the DMZ, he added. Lee noted that the DMZ area has overgrown forests, and MDL markers are not visible without distinctive paths.

The four runners fell \u201cin a mountainous area made slippery by the weather,\u201d Bonneville public prosecutor Karline Bouisset told BFMTV.

{"id": "2024_06_15_europe_ukraine-peace-summit-switzerland-intl", "text": "More than 100 countries and organizations have gathered for a major conference in Switzerland dedicated to setting out a path toward peace between Ukraine and Russia, but there will be no delegation from Moscow. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is aiming to use the meeting, which is being held at a resort near Lucerne, to drum up support for the 10-point peace plan he first outlined late in 2022. Addressing the conference on Saturday, Zelensky said the proposal for ending the war would be submitted to Russia once it had been agreed by the other nations in attendance and there would then be a second peace summit, where \u201cwe can fix the real end of the war.\u201d \u201cThe peace formula is inclusive, and we are happy to hear and work on all proposals, all ideas of what is really needed for peace and what is important to you dear friends,\u201d Zelensky said. \u201cI urge you to be as active as possible and I am proud all parts of the world, all continents are now represented at the peace summit,\u201d he added. Most Western governments have sent representatives at a senior level. US Vice President Kamala Harris is attending and announced that Washington will supply Kyiv with an aid package of more than $1.5 billion to help the country rebuild its battered infrastructure and address humanitarian needs stemming from the conflict,\u00a0according to a statement from the White House on Saturday. \u201cThis war remains an utter failure for Putin. I am here in Switzerland to stand with Ukraine and the leaders from around the world in support of a just and lasting peace,\u201d Harris said. Heads of state and government from several European states, including France, Germany and the UK are also joining, as is Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. However, China will not attend. It has said that any such meeting needs to be attended by both Russia and Ukraine. Zelensky\u2019s plan includes demands for a cessation of hostilites, the restoration of Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity, the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukrainian soil and the restoration of Ukraine\u2019s \ufeffpre-war borders with Russia. It also calls for the establishment of a special tribunal to prosecute Russian war crimes. \u201cUkraine never wanted this war, it\u2019s a criminal and absolutely unprovoked aggression of Russia. And the only one who wanted it was Putin,\u201d Zelensky said. Russia has expressed little interest in agreeing to those terms and has shown no sign of compromise when it comes to the territorial issues. On Friday, the day before the summit was set to kick off, Russian President Vladimir Putin restated the Kremlin\u2019s own peace plan, which Ukraine is unlikely to ever agree to. The proposal calls for Ukrainian troops withdraw from four southern and eastern regions of Ukrainian territory that Moscow said it would annex in violation of international law and demands Kyiv abandon its bid to join\u00a0NATO. While Russian forces have made modest gains in two of the regions \u2013 Donetsk and Luhansk \u2013 in recent months, they are far from occupying all four, which include Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. Putin said later in the day that nearly 700,000 Russian soldiers are fighting in Ukraine, a hike from the 617,000 he reported during a end-of-year press conference in 2023. Zelensky responded in an interview with Italian television that \u201cthe fact that Putin says to give them part of our territories, occupied and unoccupied, speaks about several regions of our country, and he will stop (there), and there will be no frozen conflict.\u201d \u201cThe messages are the same as Hitler\u2019s,\u201d said Zelensky \u201cPutin understands that there will be a peace summit.

{"id": "2024_06_14_africa_sudan-darfur-genocide-fears-explainer-intl", "text": "Darfur, a region in western Sudan, has a tragic history marked by ethnic violence and humanitarian crises. In the early 2000s, the area experienced a brutal conflict that resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people and displaced millions. Today, there are alarming signs that Darfur may be heading towards another genocide. For more than a year, swathes of Sudan have erupted in fierce clashes between the Sudanese Army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) that have left more 14,000 people dead and displaced more than 8 million others, according to the United Nations. But their battle for territorial control has now drifted toward El Fasher, the last major town in Darfur that\u2019s yet to be conquered by the RSF. Analysts say it\u2019s only a matter of days before El Fasher falls to the rebels. What\u2019s happening in Darfur? Ethnic-related killings have intensified in Darfur since fighting broke out in mid-April last year between the rival military factions. The RSF, which evolved from the Arab Janjaweed militia that spearheaded the genocide of the early 2000s, killing an estimated 300,000 people, has however, targeted the Masalit ethnic group and other non-Arab communities. Reports indicate widespread atrocities, including mass killings, sexual violence, and the systematic destruction of villages. Human Rights Watch and other organizations have documented these abuses, which have been likened to ethnic cleansing campaigns. The violence has forced tens of thousands of people to flee, many seeking refuge in neighboring Chad, the UN Refugee Agency said. At least 134 people were killed in El Fasher last month after gunfire rang out in the city and bombs fell on civilian homes as RSF fighters encircled the town. Last week, North Darfur\u2019s main hospital in El Fasher was also forced to close after the RSF raided the facility and looted vital supplies. The hospital had previously been hit by bullets and mortar shells. Indicators of genocide The RSF is headed by Mohamed Hamdan Dagolo, also known as Hemedti, a former leader of the Janjaweed militia. Analysts told CNN that the targeted nature of the violence in Darfur, the systematic approach of the RSF, and the historical context of ethnic conflicts in the region all suggest that the situation could evolve into another genocide. The intent to destroy the Masalit people and other non-Arab groups mirrors the patterns of violence that characterized the genocide of the early 2000s, said Sudanese lawyer Mutasim Ali. \u201cThe RSF uses systematic dehumanization method against non-Arabs in Darfur, saying,\u00a0\u2018these are dirt, dogs and monkeys\u2019 and \u2018let\u2019s kill the babies and males because if they grow up, they will fight us back.\u2019 There is a systematic policy of dehumanization .. the same explicit incitement from since the early 2000s,\u201d said Ali, a legal adviser at the Raoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights. In April, the United Nations Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide, Alice Wairimu Nderitu, warned that \u201cprevailing signs of genocide\u201d and \u201cgrave human rights violations and abuses continue to be reported against innocent civilian populations\u201d in Sudan. \u201cMost of the atrocities that are committed today\u00a0are by the same actors in the early 2000s.\u00a0The RSF is rebranded Janjaweed militia: same commanders, same ethnic tribes, and the same victim groups (non-Arab communities) in Darfur\u00a0that are being systematically targeted by the RSF,\u201d Ali told CNN. He added: \u201cWe see that the perpetrators are documenting their abuses by themselves. Back in the day, there were no cell\u00a0phones,\u00a0and (abuses) were primarily documented by human rights organizations that were in Sudan.\u00a0But this time, they document killing people, burning villages, and their incitement.\u201d Weapons support from regional powers Ali says that technology and sophisticated weaponry are the only peculiarities that differentiate the RSF\u2019s current atrocities from the genocide committed by the Janjaweed more than two decades ago. Where previously, they used camels, horses, and basic weapons. The militia now has armored vehicles, drones, and advanced weaponry, along with significant support from regional powers and nations such as the United Arab Emirates, Ali said. A June 12 report by the Yale Humanitarian Research Lab said that a cargo plane believed to be owned by the UAE was identified through satellite imagery flying within RSF-controlled areas in El-Fasher on June 11. \u201cThe same model of aircraft (IL-76) is reported to be used for lethal aid transfers by the UAE to the RSF for flights to locations in Chad,\u201d the report added. The UAE has denied providing military, financial, or logistical support to any armed group in Sudan. What happens if El Fasher falls? US Special Envoy for Sudan, Tom Perriello, said this week that El Fasher\u2019s fall to the RSF could be imminent. Home to nearly 2 million people, the city is predominantly occupied by non-Arab\u00a0ethnic groups, including the Masalit. El Fasher also shelters hundreds of thousands of displaced people who fled other parts of Darfur that were captured by the RSF, including El Geneina where hundreds of non-Arab people were massacred last year. Ali told CNN similar atrocities were likely to happen in El Fasher if the city came under RSF control. \u201cEl Fasher is going to be a lot more catastrophic because it is basically in the middle of a desert. Even if people decide to leave, probably they will die\u00a0in the desert. We will see another genocide on our watch.\u201d What has been the international response? The UN Security Council adopted a UK-led\u00a0resolution Thursday demanding that the RSF ends its \u201csiege\u201d of El Fasher. \u201cThe fighting must stop now,\u201d said UK Foreign Secretary\u00a0David Cameron in a post on X, adding that warring \u201cparties must let in urgent humanitarian aid to prevent a famine.\u201d Earlier this week, the International Criminal Court said it was investigating allegations of war crimes in El Fasher while making a public call for evidence. International response to the conflict has however been criticized as insufficient. Despite calls for action, including the deployment of protective missions and the imposition of sanctions by the United States on key RSF commanders, concrete measures have been limited. \u201cThe international response does not come close to meeting the scale of the world\u2019s largest man-made humanitarian disaster,\u201d said\u00a0international human rights lawyer, Yonah Diamond. \u201cThe major powers have largely invested in a sham peace process for 14 months that is going nowhere and serves as a cover for daily mass atrocities on the ground. Only concrete acts of protection and accountability will stem the violence,\u201d he told CNN. International efforts to broker ceasefires between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the RSF have been unsuccessful. Diamond said there has also been insufficient coverage of the Sudan war when compared to other global conflicts. \u201cEvery major news outlet has dedicated an ongoing slot to Gaza and Ukraine, with ad hoc coverage for Sudan. There is no reason why a conflict impacting a greater number of civilians, threatening millions with death by starvation and an ongoing genocide do not receive the same attention,\u201d he said. He noted that this lack of attention hinders humanitarian efforts, pointing out that while Gaza and Ukraine have each received about 30% of their humanitarian response plans, Sudan, where 25 million people urgently need help, has received only about half of that amount. What will happen next? As Sudan steers dangerously towards another genocide, the world\u2019s response in the coming months will be crucial in determining the outcome. \u201cThe international community, led by the African Union, must deploy a civilian protection mechanism to protect the millions at risk in El Fasher and elsewhere in Sudan and explicitly threaten the UAE with consequences should it fail to restrain the RSF and continue to supply the militias with heavy weaponry,\u201d Diamond advised. \u201cThe US, the UK, and others have leverage to exert pressure on their ally, the UAE, to end the RSF\u2019s genocidal campaign today. President (Joe) Biden can simply call on the UAE to halt its support for the RSF, which would fall apart without it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/africa/sudan-darfur-genocide-fears-explainer-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "world"}}
