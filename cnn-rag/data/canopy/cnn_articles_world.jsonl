{"id": "2024_05_21_weather_midwest-severe-storm-tornado-forecast-tuesday", "text": "Multiple tornadoes tracked across western Iowa on Tuesday afternoon, leading to at least one death and causing major damage to a small city as robust storms roar to life in the Midwest. The storm-related death occurred in Adams County, Iowa \u2013 about 90 miles southwest of Des Moines \u2013 the county medical examiner Lisa Brown told CNN. Brown was unable to give additional details on the death, but said it was due to a tornado. A destructive storm also went through the city of Greenfield, Iowa \u2013 about 50 miles southwest of Des Moines \u2013 and produced a tornado shortly before 5 p.m., causing \u201ca lot of damage\ufeff\u201d to many houses and other structures, Iowa State Patrol spokesperson Sgt. Alex Dinkla told CNN. Video taken by CNN affiliate KCCI shows the destructive path of the tornado that ripped through Greenfield. Decimated homes and flattened structures, piles of debris, damaged cars and countless toppled trees can be seen in the footage. \u201cThere is basically nothing left,\u201d Clel Baudler, a former Iowa state representative who lives a half mile from Greenfield, told CNN on Tuesday. \u201cIt went right through Greenfield.\u201d The potent line of thunderstorms developing Tuesday afternoon prompted a rare \u201cpotentially dangerous situation\u201d tornado watch for parts of Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Illinois from the Storm Prediction Center. The special kind of tornado watch is only issued when there\u2019s unusually high confidence in the potential of multiple long-lived and EF2 or stronger tornadoes. Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds authorized a proclamation of disaster emergency for 15 counties due to the storm outbreak, saying it will allow state resources \u201cto respond to and recover from the effects of the severe weather,\u201d in a news release. Over 65,000 customers were out of power in Iowa as of 8 p.m Tuesday, according to Poweroutage.us. Tornadoes are one of the many serious hazards expected with Tuesday\u2019s severe thunderstorm outbreak, according to the SPC. Destructive, hurricane-strength wind gusts up to 90 mph and softball-size hail are also likely. More than 25 million people across the region are under a Level 3 of 5 or Level 4 of 5 risk of severe thunderstorms Tuesday, the SPC said. The biggest area of concern for widespread, hazardous impacts centers on much of Iowa, northwest Illinois, southwest Wisconsin and northern Missouri. Chicago, Milwaukee and other population centers are also at risk of damaging storms. The Des Moines International Airport temporarily closed late Tuesday afternoon as dangerous storms headed into Des Moines, prompting\u00a0tornado warnings. The city remains in the bull\u2019s-eye of the strongest storms and potential tornadoes. \u201cTwo tornado warnings for the Des Moines metro with both warnings having observed tornadoes. Seek shelter,\u201d the National Weather Service office there said at 4:45 p.m. local time. Emergency management officials in Montgomery County, Iowa, confirmed \u201cmultiple tornadoes\u201d occurred within the county Tuesday afternoon, and no injuries have been reported thus far. Officials are currently working on clearing roads to access affected properties. \u201cDamage assessments will be ongoing this evening and tomorrow,\u201d the agency said. Flash flooding triggered by heavy rainfall also poses a threat for parts of Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Nebraska, where flood and tornado watches are in effect Tuesday afternoon. Rainfall totals of 1 to 3 inches are possible with some places eyeing totals of up to 5 inches. Storms are expected to reach their peak strength in the Midwest through the afternoon and carry into Tuesday night. Powerful storms pushed through parts of the Midwest Tuesday morning and unloaded damaging hurricane-force winds and flooding rainfall. Parts of Omaha were plunged underwater Tuesday morning as 3 to 6 inches of rain deluged eastern Nebraska. Multiple water rescues unfolded in the city, the Omaha Fire Department said on X. Additional severe thunderstorms are expected to develop on Wednesday in a 1,500 mile stretch from Texas to western New York. Any storm could unload damaging winds and hail. A few tornadoes are also possible on Wednesday, mainly from Texas to Kentucky. Rounds of severe storms have been making their way across the US over the past week, including a devastating storm that struck Houston on Thursday, leaving hundreds of thousands of residents without power amid unseasonable heat. Dangerous heat in Houston amid power outages High temperatures in Houston will push into the 90s each afternoon for much of the week as a large number of residents remain without power due to destructive storms on Thursday. Severe storms unleashed a tornado and 100 mph winds last week on Harris County, which includes Houston, and sent sheets of rain and large debris whipping through the air as people took cover inside cars, grocery stores and hotel lobbies. The violent conditions killed at least eight people, ripped out skyscraper windows, downed critical power infrastructure, caused a sewage spill and made roads impassable. Electricity has yet to be restored for more than 140,000 homes and businesses in Harris County as of Tuesday morning, according to PowerOutage.us. While authorities had previously warned that power restoration could take weeks, the area\u2019s power utility has promised an earlier timeline. Power restoration will be \u201csubstantially complete\u201d in Harris County by Wednesday evening, power provider CenterPoint Energy said in a Monday news release. But heat will take a very concerning turn for anyone that remains without power after midweek. A dangerous heat wave is ramping up over south Texas this week and will reach the central Gulf Coast by the weekend. Some daily high temperature records could be broken. The worst heat is expected to begin over the weekend in the Houston area. Memorial Day could be the hottest day of the year so far in the city, according to the National Weather Service. \u201cRecord or near-record warm overnight temperatures will provide little to no relief to those without adequate or reliable cooling,\u201d the National Weather Service warns. Heat is the deadliest form of extreme weather and poses a growing threat as human-driven climate change leads to longer and more intense periods of excessive heat. The heat index \u2013 a measurement of how hot the body actually feels \u2013 will climb into the upper 90s in the afternoons and occasionally reach 100 degrees for much of the work week. Heat index values from 105 to 110 degrees are possible over the weekend. Heat relief will finally arrive toward the end of the month.

{"id": "2024_05_19_asia_lai-chingte-taiwan-president-inauguration-intl-hnk", "text": "Taiwan President Lai Ching-te called on Beijing to cease its intimidation of the democratic island after he was was sworn in as president Monday, marking the start of a historic third consecutive term for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which has championed democracy in the face of years of growing threats\u00a0from authoritarian China. Lai, 64, a former doctor and vice president, was inaugurated alongside new Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim, who recently served as Taiwan\u2019s top envoy to the United States. Both leaders and their party are openly loathed by Beijing for championing Taiwan\u2019s sovereignty. China\u2019s ruling Communist Party says the self-ruling democracy is part of its territory, despite never having controlled it, and has vowed to take the island, by force if necessary. Lai used his 30-minute inaugural speech to broadcast a message of peace and declare that a \u201cglorious era of Taiwan\u2019s democracy has arrived,\u201d describing the island as an \u201cimportant link\u201d in a \u201cglobal chain of democracies,\u201d while reiterating a determination to defend its sovereignty. \u201cThe future of the Republic of China Taiwan will be decided by its 23 million people. The future we decide is not just the future of our nation, but the future of the world,\u201d Lai said, using the formal name for Taiwan. Lai takes up the mantle from his DPP predecessor Tsai Ing-wen, who bolstered the island\u2019s international standing and recognition during her eight years in office. Tsai, Taiwan\u2019s first female president, was unable to stand again because of term limits. Lai emerged victorious over rivals in the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) party and the Taiwan People\u2019s Party in a January election, which was fought over a mixture of livelihood issues as well as the thorny question of how to deal with its giant one-party state neighbor, China, which under leader Xi Jinping has grown more powerful and bellicose. Then, voters shrugged off warnings from Beijing that the DPP\u2019s re-election would increase the risk of conflict. The DPP holds the view that Taiwan is a de facto sovereign nation that should bolster defenses against China\u2019s threats and deepen relations with democratic countries. In his inaugural address, Lai called on China \u201cto cease their political and military intimidation against Taiwan, share with Taiwan the global responsibility of maintaining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait as well as the greater region, and ensure the world is free from the fear of war.\u201d A soft-spoken political veteran, Lai hails from a more radical wing of the DPP, and was once an open supporter of Taiwan independence \u2013 a red line for Beijing. Though his views have tempered since then, China never forgave him for his comments from six years ago, in which he described himself as a \u201cpractical worker for Taiwan independence.\u201d Lai has now said he favors the current status quo, proclaiming that \u201cTaiwan is already an independent sovereign country\u201d so there is \u201cno plan or need\u201d to declare independence, in a deliberately nuanced stance that mimics the one held by outgoing Tsai. When asked about Lai\u2019s inauguration in a regular briefing Monday, a spokesperson for China\u2019s Foreign Ministry said \u201cTaiwan independence is a dead end. No matter what pretext or banner one uses, promoting Taiwan independence and secession is doomed to fail.\u201d Lai\u2019s inauguration ceremony was attended by national leaders from a handful of countries with which Taiwan still maintains formal diplomatic ties, several former American officials, and lawmakers from other countries, according to Taiwan\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In a statement, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken offered his congratulations to Lai and \u201cthe Taiwan people for once again demonstrating the strength of their robust and resilient democratic system.\u201d \u201cWe look forward to working with President Lai and across Taiwan\u2019s political spectrum to advance our shared interests and values, deepen our longstanding unofficial relationship, and maintain peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait,\u201d Blinken said. Frictions with Beijing Lai takes office during a particularly contentious period between Taiwan and China, which in recent years has ramped up diplomatic, economic and military pressure on the self-governing democracy as Taiwan\u2019s leaders tightened informal ties with Washington. In his inaugural address, Lai said he hoped China would \u201cface the reality of the Republic of China\u2019s existence, respect the choices of the people of Taiwan,\u201d and \u201cengage in cooperation with the legal government chosen by Taiwan\u2019s people.\u201d He called for the resumption of tourism on a reciprocal basis and enrollment of degree students in Taiwanese institutions as steps to \u201cpursue peace and mutual prosperity.\u201d But the new president also warned against harboring delusions, even as Taiwan pursues \u201cthe ideals of peace.\u201d \u201cSo long as China refuses to renounce the use of force against Taiwan, all of us in Taiwan ought to understand, that even if we accept the entirety of China\u2019s position and give up our sovereignty, China\u2019s ambition to annex Taiwan will not simply disappear,\u201d Lai said. Beijing has sought to portray Lai as inciting conflict, repeatedly framing the elections earlier this year as a choice between \u201cpeace and war.\u201d On Monday, China\u2019s Taiwan Affairs Office reiterated that rhetoric, slamming \u201cthe leader of the Taiwan region\u201d as \u201csending dangerous signals of seeking independence, provocations and undermining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.\u201d Xi has placed \u201creunification\u201d with Taiwan as a key part of his goal to achieve China\u2019s \u201cnatural rejuvenation.\u201d But under the strongarm tactics of his more than one decade in power, Taiwan\u2019s public has shifted determinedly away from China. Less than 10% now support an immediate or eventual unification, and less than 3% identify primarily as Chinese. The majority of Taiwanese want to maintain the current status quo and show no desire to be ruled by Beijing. Beijing has cut official contact with Taipei since Tsai took office. Unlike the opposition KMT, Tsai and the DPP refused to endorse the so-called \u201c1992 consensus\u201d that both Taiwan and the mainland belong to \u201cone China,\u201d but with different interpretations of what that means. Beijing, which deems the tacit agreement a precondition for dialogue. Official communication between Beijing and Taipei\u00a0is unlikely to resume as Lai takes office \u2013 with China repeatedly rebuking his offer for talks and denouncing him as a dangerous separatist. Lai is also set to face challenges \u2013 and scrutiny \u2013 in pushing through his agenda for Taiwan in parliament during his term. Unlike his predecessor, Lai will not have a parliamentary majority in the next four years. In January\u2019s election, the ruling Democratic Progressive Party only won 51 out of 113 seats. Those challenges were on show last Friday, when Taiwanese lawmakers\u2019 disagreements over new, controversial reform bills erupted in a brawl on the parliamentary floor \u2013 a chaotic display that saw some lawmakers leaping over tables and pulling colleagues to the floor, with a few members taken to hospital. In his address, Lai said that \u201ca lack of absolute majority means that the ruling and opposition parties are now all able to share their ideas, and that we will be undertaking the nation\u2019s challenges as one.\u201d But he also called for cooperation so Taiwan could \u201ccontinue down a stable path.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/19/asia/lai-chingte-taiwan-president-inauguration-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_20_middleeast_ebrahim-raisi-dies-succession-what-is-next-explainer-mime-intl", "text": "Once seen as a likely successor to Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader, President Ebrahim Raisi has died in office, leaving the Islamic Republic\u2019s hardline establishment facing an uncertain future. An ultraconservative president, 63-year-old Raisi was killed Sunday, along with Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian and other high-ranking officials, in a helicopter crash in Iran\u2019s remote northwest. Their death comes at a delicate time for a country that faces unprecedented challenges at home and from abroad. The Islamic Republic\u2019s economy remains crippled by American sanctions, its young population is becoming growingly restive, and the country faces increasingly belligerent adversaries in the Middle East and beyond. Raisi\u2019s death will \u201ctrigger elections at a time when the IRI (Islamic Republic of Iran) is at the nadir of its legitimacy and zenith of its exclusionary policies,\u201d Ali Vaez, Iran Project Director at the International Crisis Group think tank, said on X. Here\u2019s what comes next. Who steps in as president? Power has now been transferred to Mohammad Mokhber, who had served as Raisi\u2019s vice president and was on Monday approved as acting president by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the final arbiter of domestic and foreign affairs in the Islamic Republic. Not as well known as Raisi, Mokhber is \u201canother administrator,\u201d Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa program at the Chatham House think tank in London, told CNN\u2019s Becky Anderson. \u201cHe is close to the IRGC, close to the levers of power,\u201d Vakil said, adding that he is likely to present a model of \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d in the coming days. But the country must, by law, hold elections within the next 50 days. On Monday, Iranian state news IRNA said Iran\u2019s presidential\u00a0elections will take place Friday, June 28. Candidates can register from May 30 to June 3, and campaigning will run from June 12 until the morning of June 27, it added. Experts say that the elections are likely to be hastily organized, with poor voter participation. In March, Iran recorded its lowest electoral turnout since the Islamic Republic\u2019s founding in 1979, despite government efforts to rally voters ahead of the ballot. That vote \u2014 for seats in the parliament, or Majles, and the 88-member Assembly of Experts, which is tasked with picking the Supreme Leader \u2014 brought in mostly hardline politicians. \u201cThe population has by and large lost faith in the idea that change can come through the ballot box,\u201d Trita Parsi, co-founder and Executive Vice President of the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft in Washington, DC, wrote Sunday on X. The March election also barred more moderate politicians from running \u2014 including former President Hassan Rouhani, once a regime stalwart \u2014 tightening the small circle of hardliners to continue the Supreme Leader\u2019s conservative rule after he dies. \u201cReal alternatives to Iran\u2019s hardliners have simply not been allowed to stand for office in the last few elections,\u201d Parsi said on X, adding that \u201cthose alternatives have in the eyes of the majority of the population lost credibility anyways, due to the failure to deliver change.\u201d Until the Supreme Leader is replaced, however, little change is expected to follow Raisi\u2019s death, particularly on foreign policy. \u201cIt is really the Supreme Leader and the Revolutionary Guards who make the final decisions, and even in the region mostly implement Iran\u2019s regional policy,\u201d Vaez said, adding that \u201coverall we will see more continuity than change.\u201d What are the longer-term implications of Raisi\u2019s death? Raisi\u2019s death has raised questions about who will eventually succeed Iran\u2019s 85-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the most powerful man in the country. The Iranian clerical establishment had invested heavily in Raisi during his presidency, seeing him as a potential successor to Khamenei. Observers say he had been groomed to be elevated to the Supreme Leader\u2019s position. Raisi\u2019s death will create \u201ca succession crisis in Iran,\u201d Karim Sadjadpour, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, wrote on X. The late president upheld some of the regime\u2019s most hardline policies, quashing the 2022 mass protests that sought to challenge repressive laws, such as the compulsory hijab. According to the constitution, the 88-member Assembly of Experts picks the successor to the Supreme Leader after his death. Members of the Assembly itself are, however, pre-vetted by Iran\u2019s Guardian Council, a powerful 12-member body charged with overseeing elections and legislation. The Assembly of Experts has become increasingly hardline over the years. In the March vote, Raisi was re-elected to the assembly, and the Guardian Council barred Rouhani from contesting a seat. While there are procedures to selecting the Supreme Leader, discussions about successions are always \u201cvery opaque,\u201d Vakil said, adding that they take place \u201cwithin a very close circle of individuals.\u201d Some have pointed to the incumbent Supreme Leader\u2019s son Mojtaba Khamenei, a midlevel cleric, as a potential contender for the top post, but that would be a shift from the principles of the Islamic Republic, which overthrew a repressive monarchy in 1970 and has prided itself for shaking off hereditary rule. Allowing Mojtaba to replace his father may, however, spur theories that Raisi\u2019s death was not accidental, Sadjadpour said. Raisi\u2019s rivals are also likely to try to fill the vacuum he leaves, Vaez said. \u201c(This) definitely throws all the plans that offices of the Supreme Leader probably had out the window,\u201d Vaez told CNN\u2019s Paula Newton. He added, however, that Iran has no shortage of political actors who are \u201csubservient and belong to the old guard of the Islamic Republic\u201d who can replace Raisi. How will it impact Iran\u2019s foreign relations? Raisi and Amir-Abdollahian oversaw a turnaround in Iran\u2019s relations with its Arab neighbors, helping normalized relations with longtime foe Saudi Arabia,\u00a0with China\u2019s assistance. But they also saw the Islamic Republic initiate a large-scale direct attack on Israel for the first time,\u00a0after a suspected Israeli attack on an Iranian diplomatic compound in Syria. That prompted Israel to launch an unprecedented retaliation, bringing the shadow war between the two nations out into the open. Experts say that Raisi\u2019s death is unlikely to have an impact on the regime\u2019s foreign policy, which is almost exclusively the domain of the Supreme Leader. Iran\u2019s foreign policy is decided by the Supreme National Security Council and can be vetoed by the Supreme Leader, Mohammad Ali Shabani, Iran expert and editor of the Amwaj.media news outlet, told CNN\u2019s Anderson. \u201cWe will see continuity in terms of how Iran approaches the regional files, collaboration with regional allies.\u201d He added that a similar trajectory is likely to be seen on the nuclear program. Could the upcoming presidential election bring change to Iran? Some experts say that the election presents an opportunity for the regime to bring back sidelined moderates. While Khamenei is likely to maintain conservative rule, he \u201chas always emphasized voter turnout as a litmus test of the legitimacy of the system,\u201d Shabani said. \u201cThat election can be a watershed moment for Iran.\u201d Raisi came to power in elections that many Iranians saw as a foregone conclusion. With moderate candidates squeezed out, voter turnout was extremely low,\u00a0highlighting the regime\u2019s waning legitimacy. \u201cIf the Supreme Leader chooses to use these early elections as a watershed moment to open up the political space, to get people to vote again, that could be a massive gamechanger,\u201d Shabani said, adding that this would also impact succession to the Supreme Leader. What are the funeral plans? Multi-day funeral ceremonies for Raisi will begin on Tuesday in Tabriz and continue in Qom, Tehran and Mashhad, according to Mohsen Mansouri, the head of the funeral planning committee and and Iran\u2019s vice president of executive affairs. Speaking to\u00a0state television\u00a0on Monday, Mansouri said funeral prayers will begin in the northwestern city of Tabriz at 9:30 a.m. local time on Tuesday. There will be a procession from the Tabriz Martyr\u2019s Square to the Tabriz Mosallah (prayer hall). Later on Tuesday, the bodies of the victims of the helicopter crash will be transferred to the holy Shiite city of Qom, where funeral prayers will take place at 4:30 p.m. local time (9 a.m. ET) outside the Fatima Masumeh Shrine. Afterwards, on Tuesday evening, the bodies will be transferred to Tehran\u2019s Grand Mosallah Mosque, according to Mansouri. On Wednesday, large ceremonies are planned in Tehran at the Grand Mosallah. One or two other ceremonies will be announced later, according to Mansouri. On Thursday morning, funeral prayers will begin in Birjand, South Khorasan province, where Raisi served as the Supreme Leader\u2019s representative. Later on Thursday, Raisi\u2019s body will be transferred to the Imam Reza shrine in Mashhad where Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei will conduct prayers over Raisi\u2019s body, according to Mehr news. On Thursday night, Raisi\u2019s body will be buried in Mashhad, according to Mansouri. Mansouri also announced the closure of offices on Wednesday all over the country, and said the governors in the provinces where processions will take place can declare public holidays on Wednesday.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/middleeast/ebrahim-raisi-dies-succession-what-is-next-explainer-mime-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_21_travel_braceros-landmark-texas-rio-vista-cec", "text": "Some of Sebastian Corral\u2019s memories have faded. But the 91-year-old remembers his 1953 arrival in the US as if it were yesterday. How workers like him were forced to strip naked and sprayed with insecticide. How their hands were inspected to make sure they were qualified for the hard labor that awaited them. How unwelcome he and so many others felt even though they\u2019d been invited across the border by the US government. \u201cYou felt humiliated. You felt like you were nothing, even though you\u2019d come to work and lift yourself up,\u201d Corral told CNN in a recent interview via Zoom from his home in Vado, New Mexico. Memories of those first moments in America came rushing back for Corral this month during a dramatically different visit to the place where he took his first steps in the country more than 70 years ago. This time, officials were unveiling plaques designating the former Rio Vista Bracero Reception Center in Socorro, Texas, as a National Historic Landmark. And Corral was a guest of honor. A long-overlooked chapter in US history is getting more attention Corral and millions of others who crossed the border like him between 1942 and 1964 were known as braceros, a term derived from the Spanish word for arm and referencing the grueling labor participants in the Mexican Farm Worker Program would be doing upon arrival. The partnership between the US and Mexico legally brought more than 4 million guest workers across the border to work largely in agriculture in 30 participating states across the country. The program purported to protect workers from discrimination. But the reality was much harsher for many braceros. Years after the program ended, one of its former directors described it as \u201clegalized slavery\u201d in an interview with the Dallas Morning News. \u201cThey were so fearful of being away from their homes and not sending money to their families that they felt pretty much in bondage,\u201d former Department of Labor official Lee G. Williams told the newspaper. The bracero program is an important chapter of US history that\u2019s long been overlooked, according to Yolanda Ch\u00e1vez Leyva, an associate professor at the University of Texas at El Paso. Many people aren\u2019t aware of how significantly the program shaped immigration in the US, or the large number of families who can trace their roots in the US back to the initiative. \u201cIt\u2019s coming to light more, but it\u2019s still not taught very often. History textbooks might have a paragraph on it,\u201d Leyva says. Even within former braceros\u2019 families, she says, sometimes the history has been hidden. \u201cWhat they have told me is that they didn\u2019t want to share their experiences with their families, because it was too painful, and they didn\u2019t want their children and grandchildren to know what they had gone through,\u201d says Leyva, who\u2019s spent years collecting hundreds of oral histories from former participants in the program. Blanca McCreary, one of Corral\u2019s 14 grandchildren, says she only learned about his experience as a bracero when she was studying World War II in a college course. \u201cI asked him, \u2018Do you know about this program?\u2019 And from there is when he told me everything,\u201d McCreary says. \u201cAnd every time I hear him talk about it, I feel the same emotions. It makes me angry. I say, \u2018How is it possible that they treated my grandpa like this? How is it possible that they treated them, as my grandpa says, like animals? These are human beings.\u2019\u201d Leyva says Corral and his story immediately came to mind when officials were planning the event at Rio Vista, and looking for a bracero to invite. He\u2019s one of the last known surviving braceros living in the region, Leyva says. Many have died in recent years, she says, especially during the pandemic. Why Rio Vista is so significant \u2013 and rare The Rio Vista site, a key hub for the program, is about a 30-minute drive from El Paso, Texas. It\u2019s comprised of more than 20 buildings, including historic adobe barracks and wooden structures. And it\u2019s the only one of five locations where braceros were processed that\u2019s still standing. According to a description on the National Trust for Historic Preservation website, more than 80,000 braceros passed annually through Rio Vista, where they were \u201cmet with terrible food, humiliating medical and psychological examinations and fumigation.\u201d Corral says he was held at the site for several days before a rancher arrived and contracted him. Over the years, the facilities \u2014 constructed in 1915 \u2014 have served a variety of purposes. Before its role in the bracero program, the area known as Rio Vista Farm was a poor farm and an orphanage. After the bracero program, it became a law enforcement training area, began housing some city offices and a community center, and even served as a set for the 2000 film \u201cTraffic.\u201d Sehila Mota Casper, executive director of Latinos in Heritage Conservation, says she was amazed when she first discovered the site while working at the National Trust for Historic Preservation. \u201cTraditionally our sites have been demolished. They\u2019ve been overlooked. They\u2019ve been displaced, erased,\u201d Mota Casper told reporters earlier this month. \u201cTo find out this building still exists was incredible.\u201d For years, Mota Casper, Leyva and city officials from Socorro pushed to get the Rio Vista site designated as a landmark. With that accomplished, now they\u2019re working to turn it into the first Bracero History Museum in the United States. Construction is slated to begin at the site later this year, with plans for the museum to open in 2027. In Socorro, a small town outside El Paso, officials view the recent landmark designation as a major milestone. \u201cIt\u2019s like Ellis Island or the Alamo, what we have here, and it\u2019s so prudent that we\u2019re good stewards to make sure that we protect it and that we preserve it so others can appreciate it,\u201d Victor Reta, the city\u2019s director of recreation and historic preservation, told reporters. The city also plans to open its first library at the site, and has been raising money for the project on its website. Once the museum opens, Corral says he\u2019s hoping many more Americans will visit Rio Vista and learn the legacy of the braceros. \u201cI want them to know that it wasn\u2019t easy, what we lived here,\u201d he says. What revisiting the site revealed But Corral says he and many others felt like they had no other choice. In an oral history interview last year with the University of Texas at El Paso, Corral noted that farmworkers where he\u2019d been living in Delicias, Mexico, made just 4 pesos a day. In the US, he could make eight times as much. So Corral began his first three-month contract picking cotton on a farm in New Mexico  and never looked back, though he returned regularly to Mexico to visit family.\u00a0Corral continued as a bracero for 11 years until the program ended, then did everything he could to stay in the US and keep working. Today, he describes the long journey that began at Rio Vista with pride: \u201cI came as a bracero. After being a bracero, then I was illegal for some years. After being illegal, then I was a permanent resident. Now I am a citizen.\u201d In some ways, Rio Vista wasn\u2019t like Corral remembered when he returned this month. The buildings were more worn-down \u2014 some \u201cpure ruins,\u201d Corral says. But what Corral noticed most wasn\u2019t the buildings; it was how differently he felt being there. \u201cI was not the same person as before,\u201d he says. So much had changed since those first days when he was a young man waiting for a rancher to arrive at Rio Vista with work. He\u2019d harvested cotton, and driven tractors, and picked beets and cucumbers as a bracero. He\u2019d lived in New Mexico, Colorado, Wyoming and Texas during his years in the program. Once, an El Paso restaurant had refused to serve him because he was Mexican. He\u2019d been an undocumented immigrant for decades. He\u2019d washed dishes and prepped food in a Los Angeles restaurant. He\u2019d worked at dairy farms in California. He\u2019d become a legal resident after President Reagan signed a law granting him and millions of others amnesty. He\u2019d finally brought his wife and children to the US after years of separation. He\u2019d saved enough money to buy land for all of them to build homes nearby. He\u2019d had 14 grandchildren and 17 great-grandchildren. And just two years ago, he\u2019d finally become a US citizen after decades of knowing he was American, nearly 70 years after his first arrival in the United States. All of this went through Corral\u2019s mind as he revisited Rio Vista on May 11. And in the mix of emotions that hit him, he felt anger at some points, but also, contentment. Some of the buildings around him were in ruins as they awaited renovation. But Corral was standing in the Rio Vista courtyard with generations of his family beside him. And he saw something else: the life that he built.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/travel/braceros-landmark-texas-rio-vista-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "world_africa_earthranger-track-wildlife-kenya-spc", "text": "It\u2019s early morning in Sera Community Conservancy in Northern Kenya and sunlight beats down across this expansive semi-arid landscape. Birds calling and boots crunching are the only sounds for miles as a team led by Kenyan wildlife veterinarian Dr. Mukami Ruoro-Oundo carefully tracks white rhinos \u2014 the first of their kind to be found here in Samburu County. Once common in the area, by the early 1990s Northern Kenya\u2019s rhino population was decimated by poaching. But the country\u2019s black rhino population has more than doubled since 1989, and by December 2022 there were 1,900 black rhinos and white rhinos in total, according to Kenya Wildlife Services. Sera Conservancy has championed the country\u2019s community-led rhino conservation efforts. In 2015 it established East Africa\u2019s first community rhino sanctuary with the introduction of 10 critically endangered black rhinos. Today, that number has grown to 21 black rhinos which freely roam across 107 square kilometers (41 square miles) of designated sanctuary land, and in February 2024, they were joined by four white rhinos from the nearby Lewa Conservancy. As she searches on foot, Dr. Ruoro-Oundo spots two of the female white rhinos. One, called Sarah, looks heavily pregnant but as the vet creeps closer she notices something is very wrong. Mindful of not encroaching too long on the rhinos\u2019 territory and reluctant to intervene unnecessarily, she opts for a different approach; through a conservation technology tool called EarthRanger she can monitor Sarah\u2019s movements in real time from a distance.\u00a0 Prior to translocation, each of the four white rhinos was fitted with a GPS tag in its horns and ears, which sends a real-time location to remote devices like mobile phones, or to the conservancy\u2019s operations center, where Dr. Ruoro-Oundo is able to monitor Sarah\u2019s location and movements. As EarthRanger\u2019s co-founder Jake Wall tells CNN, \u201cIt\u2019s exactly like a \u2018Find my Friends\u2019 for rhino.\u201d Sparse internet connectivity means Dr. Ruoro-Oundo cannot get a clear signal from Sarah\u2019s transmitter but thankfully Sarah is not alone; a female rhino named Arot has never left her side and through Arot\u2019s transmitter Dr. Ruoro-Oundo can see that Sarah has barely moved in hours, suggesting her condition is deteriorating. By using a drone to take photos of her, the team is able to confirm that Sarah urgently needs help. \u201cWe noticed she has a fecal impaction, it was quite huge and had made the rectal and vulvar area swollen,\u201d says Dr. Ruoro-Oundo. \u201cShe\u2019s in a lot of pain because she could not put down her tail, and you could see she was a bit sluggish, she really wanted to spend her time lying down. So in such a case we really need to intervene for her comfort, to relieve her of the distress and the pain.\u201d An emergency intervention is immediately put into action, led by Kenya Wildlife Services and Sera Conservancy\u2019s management and rangers. Air, ground and additional veterinary support are mobilized within hours \u2014 potentially saving not only Sarah\u2019s life but that of her unborn calf too. For Dr. Ruoro-Oundo, the key to safeguarding Kenya\u2019s wildlife is a balance between community and technology. \u201cI think you cannot separate technology from conservation in the future,\u201d she says.\u201d The human element can never be removed, but technology will always come to assist where we cannot reach.\u201d A global effort Now used in 70 countries, EarthRanger\u2019s story started in Kenya when co-founder Wall was researching elephants there. \u201cIn about 2012, we had a real crisis with poaching in Kenya, so we wanted a way that we could pick up on elephants that were getting killed, and the sign for us was that the collar stopped moving for more than about five or six hours, which is the longest sort of period that an elephant rests for,\u201d he recalls. \u201cSo I wrote the algorithm that could work out whether an elephant had stopped moving or not, and then (the collar) would send an SMS if it had. So that was kind of the beginning.\u201d He adds that the system has evolved quite significantly since then, and Sarah is one of 9,000 animals \u2014 including elephants, lions, giraffe, tortoises, sea turtles and 1,200 rhinos \u2014 that EarthRanger is currently tracking in Kenya alone. Wall says the system can integrate data from more than 100 different devices \u2014 \u201canything from elephant trackers to ear tags for rhino, to collars for lions, tail tags (for giraffes), devices that glue onto the shell of a turtle.\u201d It can also receive information from sources such as vehicle trackers, satellites, and remote sensing alerts for things like deforestation and fire. \u201cIt\u2019s pulling it all into one platform, where it can be readily visualized, analyzed and then acted upon,\u201d Wall adds. \u201cAnd all of that\u2019s giving the operators and managers a bird\u2019s eye view of the situation as it\u2019s happening, with real-time tools.\u201d According to the EarthRanger, all of these devices are designed to be lightweight, durable and inconspicuous ensuring they don\u2019t impact on the animals\u2019 natural behavior or cause them discomfort. For rhinos, Dr. Ruoro-Oundo says that attaching a tracker is the equivalent sensation of a human getting their ears pierced. Samuel Lekimaroro, a wildlife protection manager for the Northern Rangelands Trust, which includes Sera Conservancy, uses this kind of data to live-track terrestrial and marine wildlife across 6.5 million hectares. For Lekimaroro it has become a powerful tool in translocating wildlife, data collection and security operations, including identifying hotspots for human-wildlife conflict. \u201cThanks to EarthRanger, trophy poaching has been on a steady decline for the last five years, from a high of 120 elephants poached in 2012, to zero in the last four years in (our) member conservancies,\u201d he says. Wall says its potential to securely collect and share data from different EarthRanger sites from across the world is revolutionary. \u201cIf organizations are doing, say, joint patrolling, or monitoring of a species, then they can also share that information,\u201d he says. \u201cBy storing information on EarthRanger we can pull that data from different sites and combine it in ways that was never possible before. So it\u2019s really enabling the analysis and the reporting in a way that just never existed before.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/world/africa/earthranger-track-wildlife-kenya-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "world"}}

Straphangers at bus stops clutch steaming coffees and huddle for warmth. On the horizon, views of the Andes are as spectacular as ever, their snow-capped peaks gleaming extra bright after an early-season storm. Santiago is under a record freeze. After an eight-day \u201ccold wave\u201d pushed through the capital region this week, the average temperature for May dropped to 37 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) \u2013 the coldest since 1950, according to Ang\u00e9lica Guz\u00e1man, a meteorologist with the Chilean Meteorologic Directorate. Thursday marked the coldest day of the year so far, with one weather station notching a frosty 30 degrees. \u201cYou have to go out dressed in double layers,\u201d said Rosita Moya, a publicist who spoke with CNN on a frigid Friday morning, the fur-lined hood of her parka turned up. \u201cI had to go searching for my hat.\u201d Chileans are used to the cold, but not this early in the year. A typical May\u00a0in Santiago\u00a0reaches a balmy high of 64 degrees, dipping down to 43 degrees at night. The brunt of the winter arrives in July, when the average low is down to 37 degrees. A mass of cold air that will last through the weekend is behind the strange forecast, Guz\u00e1man said, with below-average temperatures expected to continue. Authorities have declared a \u201ccode blue\u201d throughout the country, opening additional shelters and services for homeless populations. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be prepared: warm clothes, closed shoes, protection for your hands. Watch the parts of your body that are more exposed, we need to cover them up,\u201d a radio announcer warned on a broadcast Thursday night. Zipped tight in a puffer by the central La Vega market, Diamira Salas sipped a warm quinoa drink spiced with brown sugar and pineapple that she\u2019d just bought from a street cart, the kind of goopy, stick-to-your-bones beverage perfect to beat back a morning chill. \u201cIt has natural protein and in this cold weather it gives you calories,\u201d Salas, a nurse, said. Other Santiaguinos have been less thoughtful with their cold-weather diets. \u201cThe chocolates are selling, the cookies are selling, lots of coffee,\u201d said Nancy Mujica, who runs a magazine kiosk in the Bellas Artes neighborhood. At Santo Tisla\u2019s fruit and vegetable stand, the cold has been bad for business. Grapes are freezing into chunks of ice, and when customers stick their hands out to test produce: \u201cAh!

{"id": "2024_05_17_tech_ai-high-school", "text": "At Princeton High School, students are trying to combat the rapid decline of indigenous languages with some unlikely help: a furry, wide-eyed stuffed animal named Che\u2019w. But Che\u2019w isn\u2019t a standard plush toy. He\u2019s a wildly intelligent generative AI robot that speaks Mam, a Mayan language spoken in the western highlands of Guatemala and Mexico and by a small population of the school\u2019s students.\u00a0The language is currently at risk of extinction, according to UNESCO; the students hope Che\u2019w can help change that. At a time when some high schools are restricting the use of AI in the classroom, others, like Princeton High School, are leaning into it. In the short 18 months since the launch of viral chatbot ChatGPT, generative AI has emerged as a revolutionary technology in the field of artificial intelligence. Its capabilities have impressed both users and experts with its ability to perform a range of tasks, from generating creative content, essays and games to conducting mathematical equations, summarizing complicated concepts and more. All that is already reshaping various parts of our lives, including education. But the technology has leaped ahead far faster, in many cases, than schools\u2019 understanding of how to use it. And with new products out this week from Google\u2019s XYZ initiative and OpenAI\u2019s new GPT-4o, many teachers and districts realize they cannot avoid the subject. Dr. Joy Barnes-Johnson, the science administrator for PHS, said the school is \u201ctrying to embrace AI\u201d as much as possible. \u201cIt\u2019s a tool, just like a pencil is technology that helps communication.\u201d She said the school will host an AI summit this summer with its teachers and administrators to have a conversation about how generative AI should or shouldn\u2019t be used in the classroom. \u201cIn the beginning of the school year, we talked about how AI is the world we\u2019re in now and we have a responsibility to prepare kids for the world they will inherit,\u201d she said. \u201cThe idea is that it will help people connect and learn, so we [as teachers] have to not be afraid of it.\u201d Proceeding with caution When ChatGPT launched in November 2022, teachers worried that the tool, which can generate convincing responses and essays in response to user prompts, could make it easier for students to cheat on assignments. Some also worried ChatGPT and similar tools could be used to spread inaccurate information. Not long after its launch, New York City public schools became one of the first school districts to ban students and teachers from using ChatGPT on the district\u2019s networks and devices. Other schools reacted similarly in the weeks and months that followed, including the Los Angeles Unified School District and Seattle Public Schools, which blocked access to ChatGPT on their networks. Some of these districts have evolved their policies over time. The LAUSD, for example, has since launched a chatbot named \u201cEd\u201d to act as a student advisor, with the ability to inform parents about information ranging from children\u2019s test results to their school attendance. Many schools also continue to grapple with how to best approach the technology inside the classroom. \u201cThere is acceptance by educators, but we\u2019re still seeing a lot of caution,\u201d said Noel Candelaria, the secretary-treasurer of the National Education Association who is leading the charge around the union\u2019s AI policy. \u201cThe challenge is there isn\u2019t a lot of guidance on the district level, so the concern educators have is that it\u2019s being something done to them, instead of with them.\u201d He added: \u201cThere are also major concerns around data confidentiality and where data is being pulled from.\u201d Candelaria told CNN that educators feel strongly that they want their voice to influence how it can be applied to schools. The NEA is developing a task force with educators across the country to address many of these issues. Beyond generative AI Some high schools around the country are\u00a0trying to teach students how to use other forms of artificial intelligence for a greater good. At one prestigious public school in New York City, Stuyvesant High School, students created an app for the blind that uses artificial intelligence and tactile feedback to help people detect threats and navigate obstacles.  Similarly, at STEM School Highlands Ranch in Colorado, a team of students developed an AI-powered\u00a0wildlife detection system called Project Deer to help cut down on car crashes. Although researchers have tried to combat such accidents before, studies have shown wildlife don\u2019t consistently react to any one stimulus. So the students instead derived an AI-based predictive solution to alert the driver to an imminent threat on the road. Using four $5 infrared detection sensors placed on vehicles, the students developed a system for\u00a0AI to scan the surroundings and emit a high-pitched sound when an animal\u2019s body heat is detected, a signal that may help to scare the animal away. The school, which was the\u00a0Colorado State Winner in Samsung\u2019s annual Solve for Tomorrow competition, said it is partnering with the University of Colorado in Boulder this summer to help boost its success rate. The Solve for Tomorrow contest featured more than 1,000 schools submitting STEM-based solutions to real-world problems. Samsung told CNN there was a \u201cdefinite uptick in\u201d submitted AI-powered innovations this year compared to previous years. Computer science teacher Tylor Chacon told CNN the group\u2019s big vision is to one day have the technology regulated or adopted by the state for greater use. School administration has told teachers to help create rubrics or lesson plans, Chacon told CNN. \u201cWe\u2019ve been encouraged to embrace it and look into ways we can use it to maximize our own job effectiveness and ease the burden on us,\u201d he said. It\u2019s an increasingly common trend among teachers to use AI tools to create assignments, quizzes, polls, videos and interactives for classroom use. Some are even turning to AI tools and platforms \u2014 such as ChatGPT, Writable, Grammarly and EssayGrader \u2014 to assist with grading papers or writing feedback, a practice that is also raising ethical considerations. Saving a language, learning the future Still, as schools continue to weigh the benefits or disadvantages to teaching and using artificial intelligence, some teachers and administrators feel strongly that it\u2019s the future. At Princeton High, a group of about 14 students met during school hours for months to build out Che\u2019w\u2019s conversational capabilities, drawn from artificial intelligence neural networks that are trained to recognize patterns, solve problems and understand words, sentences and phrases from spoken and written language. Che\u2019w, which translates to \u201cstar\u201d in Mam, was trained to understand the language by the students so it can serve as a personal tutor. The robot is also trained to speak Spanish and English. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t lose patience or get sick of talking to them,\u201d said Mark Eastburn, Princeton High School\u2019s science, research and engineering teacher. \u201cIt\u2019s taking [AI] off the screen and putting it onto a physical structure that looks like a friend that can help you do whatever you need to do.\u201d In April, the students were one of the top three National Winners at the Samsung Solve For Tomorrow\u2019s competition. AI is now a part of students\u2019 lives, Eastburn said. \u201cAnd it will be there when they\u2019re in college and also in their careers,\u201d he added, \u201cso they might as well learn and use it in appropriate ways in high school, if not even earlier.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/tech/ai-high-school/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_21_sport_nfl-source-diversity-contracts-reaj", "text": "The National Football League launched a new program aimed at increasing the number of minority- and women-owned businesses that work with the league throughout the year. The initiative, called NFL Source,\u00a0was\u00a0announced during the league\u2019s spring meeting in Nashville on Tuesday and aims to\u00a0encourage\u00a0teams to reinvest in their communities by doing business with underrepresented populations. Jonathan Beane,\u00a0senior vice president and chief diversity & inclusion officer at the NFL,\u00a0\ufefftold CNN\u00a0the program\u00a0will be its most expansive diversity, equity and inclusion initiative to date and will touch \u201con the whole ecosystem of the National Football League.\u201d \u201cIt involves the clubs [teams], it involves the league, it involves our tentpole events. It touches everything,\u201d Beane said of the new program. \u201cWe are ramping up our efforts to drive supplier diversity at the league office: IT, marketing, content, it goes on and on, every business unit is going to be looking for specific opportunities and whenever a contract comes up, it\u2019s a natural [contracting] process which has slated diverse vendors,\u201d Beane said. The NFL\u2019s latest effort to increase diversity and inclusion comes a week after\u00a0the league distanced itself from recent remarks Kansas City Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker made during a commencement address that many considered sexist, and homophobic. \u201cHarrison Butker gave a speech in his personal capacity. His views are not those of the NFL as an organization,\u201d Beane said in a statement \u00a0Wednesday. \u201cThe NFL is steadfast in our commitment to inclusion, which only makes our league stronger.\u201d The new initiative also comes as DEI policies and efforts in corporate America and academia have faced a series of attacks from critics and some conservative lawmakers. Major universities and companies have slashed teams dedicated to DEI and wealthy corporate leaders, such as Bill Ackman and Elon Musk, have decried diversity programs on social media. Despite the backlash, Beane said the league remains committed to DEI and creating an inclusive environment \u201cbecause that leads to higher productivity, better business solutions, more innovation and more creativity.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re not in the business of sitting back and following someone or waiting or seeing if this is ok,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to be the benchmark in the sports industry and hopefully get to the point where hopefully we can be a benchmark for companies as a whole.\u201d The NFL Source will be mandatory\u00a0for\u00a0teams that host\u00a0major\u00a0events, such as the Super Bowl and the NFL Draft,\u00a0and their organizing committees, but will be optional for other contracts at the team level. \u201cWe are not going to force every club [team] to participate in this,\u201d Beane said. \u201cJust because a club does not opt-in doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re still not working on diversifying their vendors, but with this, what we\u2019re hoping is to get as many clubs as possible engaged into this program.\u201d The NFL spends hundreds of millions of dollars on contracts\u00a0with businesses\u00a0each year, according to a spokesperson. While previous efforts to improve supplier diversity have focused on subcontracting opportunities, officials told CNN\u00a0NFL Source will help the league\u00a0and its 32 teams\u00a0identify potential partners for both year-round and subcontract consideration. Until now, each NFL team handled the selection of suppliers of goods and services differently, but NFL Source will standardize the way the league and its partners work with certified businesses that are\u00a051% owned and operated by a minority, a woman, a person with disabilities, someone who is LGBTQ+ or a veteran,\u00a0according to a\u00a0statement obtained by CNN. NFL Source will provide a centralized entry point for these companies through a\u00a0new website, with one set of procurement standards and procedures, including criteria for which businesses will be eligible for a contract,\u00a0the league said. The league also plans to distribute a diversity playbook\u00a0of businesses\u00a0to teams that opt into the program in September 2024. In the past, efforts to address diversity and racial inequality\u00a0in the NFL\u00a0have been met with criticism from both fans and staff alike. Former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick was criticized in 2016 when he began kneeling during the\u00a0national\u00a0anthem in protest of racial injustice and ongoing police brutality in the US. His protest\u00a0sparked a movement\u00a0and inspired other athletes \u2013 from elementary schools to professional leagues \u2013 to also take a knee.\u00a0 Kaepernick and his fellow teammate, Eric Reid, later filed a lawsuit against the NFL alleging that teams kept them from playing because they protested. Both parties ultimately reached a settlement, CNN previously reported. But the kneeling controversy also became a political lightning rod and fiercely divided fans. Then-President Donald Trump said team owners should fire players for taking a knee during the national anthem. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, \u2018Get that son of a bitch off the field right now, out, he\u2019s fired. He\u2019s fired,\u201d Trump said at\u00a0a\u00a02017\u00a0rally in Alabama. In 2020, NFL players recognized the nation\u2019s racial reckoning by wearing helmets, cleats, and shorts with phrases such as \u201cNo Justice, No peace\u201d and \u201cBlack Lives Matter.\u201d The phrase \u201cEnd Racism\u201d was also painted on each team\u2019s end zone. That same year the NFL announced it would pledge $250 million over 10 years to help fight systemic racism after Black NFL players demanded the league take a strong position in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s murder,\u00a0CNN previously reported. On Monday,\u00a0Beane said the pledge has surpassed $370 million, and the funds have helped support organizations dedicated to prison reform and education, among other causes. Although people of color make up\u00a0nearly\u00a070% of NFL players\u00a0in 2022,\u00a0some\u00a0teams have\u00a0also come under fire for\u00a0historically\u00a0denying people of color the chance to be head coaches. To address this, the league adopted the\u00a0Rooney\u00a0Rule\u00a0in 2003, which was named for the late, longtime Steelers owner and chairman of the NFL\u2019s DEI committee, Dan\u00a0Rooney, and requires every team to interview\u00a0external\u00a0minority\u00a0and/or female\u00a0candidates for open\u00a0head coach,\u00a0general manager and\u00a0executive\u00a0positions. In 2022, Brian Flores, now the Minnesota Vikings defensive coordinator,\u00a0filed a federal civil\u00a0lawsuit\u00a0against\u00a0the NFL and three teams\u00a0alleging, among other things, racial discrimination in the league\u2019s hiring practices despite the rule \u2013 an allegation that the league denies. Last week, the NFL\u00a0announced\u00a0Flores is a part of the 2024 Coach Accelerator Program. Some past participants in the program have been interviewed for open positions or\u00a0\u201cpromoted and hired into more senior coaching positions,\u201d the league said in the announncement. According to a December 2023\u00a0report\u00a0by The Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport, the league has improved its hiring of more\u00a0people of color\u00a0and women, improved the diversity of assistant coaches, but received low grades for\u00a0racial\u00a0and gender diversity among team owners. There are now nine minority head coaches, including seven who are Black,\u00a0a spokesperson told CNN. Beane said he expects NFL Source may receive backlash from some NFL fans, teams and critics, but the league remains committed to inclusion. \u201cFor us, we know that everything we do is not going to make every single fan happy,\u201d Beane said. \u201cBut also, we feel very strongly that we have to continue this path because it falls within the true values and culture of the National Football League.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/sport/nfl-source-diversity-contracts-reaj/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "world"}}

Earlier, Afghanistan\u2019s Interior Ministry spokesperson Mufti Abdul Mateen Qani said the three Europeans and one Afghan citizen were killed in Bamyan city. The shooting occurred while the tourists were shopping at an open-air market in Bamyan, a Spanish diplomatic source said Saturday. \u201cThe information the Spanish government has received so far is that a group of six Spaniards were traveling in the region of Bamyan and they were attacked on Friday by at least one armed man who opened fire,\u201d the source said. Four foreign nationals and three Afghans were also injured in the attack when gunmen opened fire, Reuters reported, citing Qani, adding that four people have been arrested. A fourth Spanish citizen is among the wounded and has been transferred to a hospital in Kabul, where they are listed as being in serious condition following surgery. Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares spoke with the two Spanish citizens in the group who were unharmed by phone on Saturday, according to the diplomatic source. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez described the Spanish shooting victims as tourists, in a post on X. \u201cOverwhelmed by the news of the murder of Spanish tourists in Afghanistan.

I want to convey all my sympathy to their family and friends,\u201d the prime minister posted. Prosecutors from Spain\u2019s National Court in Madrid, which handles cases of terrorism, have opened an investigation into the shooting in Afghanistan for potential links to terrorism, the prosecution service said in a statement on Saturday. The statement added that the Spanish fatalities were a man and two women from northeastern Spain \u2013 one from Barcelona, another from Girona and the third from Figueres. Qani also expressed condolences for the deaths, saying, \u201cThe Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan strongly condemns this crime, expresses its deep feelings to the families of the victims and assures that all the criminals will be found and punished.\u201d Asked to comment on reports that an Australian national is among those injured, Australia\u2019s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said Saturday that it was \u201cproviding consular assistance\u201d to one of its citizens in Afghanistan following the deadly attack.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/asia/afghanistan-spanish-killed-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_tech_damaging-hacks-expose-the-weak-underbelly-of-americas-health-care-system", "text": "A pair of recent ransomware attacks crippled computer systems at two major American health care firms, disrupting patient care and exposing fundamental weaknesses in the US health care system\u2019s defenses against hackers. In both cases, federal officials and private cyber experts scrambled to try to limit the damage and get computers back online. But the cascading effects from the hacks, with ambulances diverted from hospitals and pharmacies unable to process insurance, has underscored for some US lawmakers, senior Biden administration officials and policy experts that the health care system is ill-prepared for the ripple effects of a cyberattack and needs new security regulations. Health care lags other industries such as big financial institutions and energy providers when it comes to IT security, according to some experts. \u201cIndustry has successfully demanded voluntary cybersecurity for years \u2014 and this is what we get,\u201d Joshua Corman, a cybersecurity expert who has focused on the health sector for years, told CNN. Sen. Ron Wyden, the Oregon Democrat who chairs the finance committee, told CNN that \u201cevery new devastating hack hammers home the need for mandatory cybersecurity standards in the health care sector, particularly when it comes to the largest companies that millions of patients depend on for care and medicine.\u201d Without action, the senator said, \u201cpatients\u2019 access to care and their personal health information will be compromised and ransomed by hackers over and over again.\u201d In 2023, 46 hospital systems in the US, comprising 141 hospitals, were impacted by ransomware,\u00a0according\u00a0to a tally from cybersecurity firm Emsisoft.\u00a0That\u2019s up from 25 hospital systems hit by ransomware in 2022, according to the firm. The two ransomware attacks hit different nerves of the health care system. In February, cybercriminals broke into an unsecured computer server used by Change Healthcare, an insurance billing giant that processes about 15 billion health care transactions annually. The hack cut off health care providers from billions of dollars of revenue, snarled service at pharmacies across the US and\u00a0may have compromised\u00a0the personal data of a third of Americans. In early May, cybercriminals used a different type of ransomware in an attack on Ascension, a St. Louis-based nonprofit network that includes 140 hospitals and 40 senior living facilities in 19 states. The hack\u00a0forced\u00a0the health network to divert ambulances from some hospitals. The Biden administration is preparing to issue minimum cybersecurity requirements for US hospitals, senior White House cyber official Anne Neuberger confirmed this month. The details of that proposal have yet to be finalized. But the American Hospital Association, which represents hospitals across the United States, opposes the proposal, saying it would effectively re-victimize victims of cyberattacks by imposing penalties after they are hacked. Officials at the Department of Health and Human Services previously said\u00a0they are willing to use a number of measures,\u00a0including\u00a0imposing\u00a0monetary fines, to both force and encourage health care organizations to better secure their systems. Momentum is also growing on Capitol Hill to force health care organizations to meet basic cybersecurity standards. A bill\u00a0introduced\u00a0in March by Sen. Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, would allow \u201cadvanced and accelerated\u201d Medicare payments to be sent to hacked health care providers as long as those providers and their contractors meet minimum cybersecurity standards. An unhealthy situation The ransomware attacks on Change Healthcare and Ascension have spotlighted the health sector\u2019s cybersecurity weakness like no other events before it, experts told CNN. And even if there are new regulatory requirements for cybersecurity, the sector \u201cwill continue to struggle from such attacks if the business of providing\u00a0healthcare remains financially fraught [and forces] leaders to prioritize only revenue generating investments,\u201d Carter Groome, chief executive of cybersecurity firm First Health Advisory, told CNN. The Change Healthcare ransomware attack, in particular, has brought fresh attention from policymakers and experts on what many see as the over-consolidation of the US health care industry. If hackers can defeat security measures at one company, millions of patients who rely on that health network can be affected. \u201cUS healthcare is in a death spiral,\u201d said Corman, who co-founded I am the Cavalry, a volunteer group that focuses on cybersecurity for resource-poor organizations in the health sector, among others. \u201cDistressed hospitals get acquired into too-big-to-fail conglomerates. Ransoms cause distress for the little ones, and multi-week, multi-state outages for the ones \u2018saved\u2019 by the big ones.\u201d Any new cybersecurity regulations should be strong enough to force meaningful improvements in the sector\u2019s cybersecurity, Corman argued. \u2018Yes. cybersecurity is costly,\u201d he said. \u201cAs we can clearly see\u2026 neglect is more costly.\u201d Change Healthcare\u2019s parent firm, UnitedHealth Group, owns a significant portion of the US health care market. The company, which reported $371 billion in revenue last year, handles one in three American patient records,\u00a0according\u00a0to the American Hospital Association. Optum, a UnitedHealth subsidiary, employs about 90,000 physicians. \u201cYour revenues are bigger than some countries\u2019 GDP,\u201d Sen. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican,\u00a0told\u00a0UnitedHealth Group CEO Andrew Witty in a Senate hearing this month.\u00a0\u201cAnd how in heaven\u2019s name did you not have the necessary redundancies so that you did not experience this attack and find yourself so vulnerable?\u201d The Justice Department has been pursuing an antitrust investigation into UnitedHealth Group, the Wall Street Journal\u00a0reported\u00a0in February. More broadly, the Justice Department last week\u00a0announced\u00a0a\u00a0task force to examine \u201chealth care monopolies and collusion\u201d that will guide the department\u2019s approach to \u201ccivil and criminal enforcement in health care markets,\u201d where warranted.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/tech/damaging-hacks-expose-the-weak-underbelly-of-americas-health-care-system/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "world"}}

Police are investigating the \u201cunexplained death\u201d of Matthew Trickett, 37, whose body was found by a member of the public in the park in Maidenhead, Berkshire, west of London, on Sunday, Thames Valley police said in a statement. Trickett had appeared alongside two other suspects at Westminster Magistrates\u2019 Court on May 13, charged with national security offences. All three were granted bail. \u201cTrickett was on court bail, awaiting court proceedings, which required him to register at a police station regularly,\u201d the police said.  In a statement, Trickett\u2019s family told British newspaper The Times: \u201cWe\u2019re mourning the loss of a much-loved son, brother and family man.\u201d The Chinese Embassy in the UK and Hong Kong\u2019s Chief Executive John Lee have both condemned and rejected the accusations. Relations between Hong Kong and its former colonial ruler Britain have soured in recent years following mass pro-democracy protests in the Chinese city in 2019 and 2020. The British government has criticized Hong Kong\u2019s Beijing-backed crackdown on almost all opposition in the years following the protests, while Hong Kong authorities have bristled at Britain providing a safe haven for pro-democracy leaders sought by the Hong Kong police. The charges against the three men allege that between December 20, 2023, and May 2, 2024, they agreed to undertake information gathering, surveillance and acts of deception that were likely to materially assist a foreign intelligence service, according to PA media. Police also alleged that on May 1, the three forced entry into a UK residential address, according to PA. While all three were granted bail, they were barred from traveling internationally with District Judge Louisa Cieciora saying they must abide by a night time curfew and report weekly to their local police station. In a recent press conference, Lee said one of the men charged was the office manager of the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in London but did not directly address a question over whether it was involved in surveillance of Hong Kong dissidents in the UK.

Tyler Wenrich, a 31-year-old American, pleaded guilty to\u00a0two counts of ammunition possession during a court hearing on Tuesday morning, Dr. Angela Brooks, deputy director of public prosecutions in Turks and Caicos, told CNN. Wenrich is one of five Americans arrested in recent months in the British Overseas Territory, where carrying firearms is prohibited. The Americans carried the ammunition in their luggage \u201cinadvertently,\u201d according to American lawmakers, and now face up to a dozen years in prison. Wenrich\u2019s hearing comes on the heels of a push from a bipartisan group of US lawmakers who traveled to Turks and Caicos to press for their release \u2013 but encountered resistance from officials on the island, the lawmakers announced Monday. Republican Sen. Markwayne Mullin led the trip, which also was attended by Democratic Sen. John Fetterman and GOP Reps. Guy Reschenthaler, Josh Brecheen, Michael Cloud and Bob Good. The lawmakers met with Turks and Caicos officials, including the governor, attorney general, minister of tourism and police leaders, the statement from Mullin\u2019s office said. \u201cUnfortunately, despite our willingness to work with Turks and Caicos officials to get our constituents home, we were not able to find a path forward today,\u201d Mullin said in the statement. \u201cAt this point, well-intentioned American citizens are facing a dozen years in prison all for unknowingly having one or two bullets in their luggage.\u201d \u201cShould they receive a prison sentence, we will need to consider additional actions to safeguard American citizens,\u201d Mullin said. The other detained Americans have been identified as Sharitta Grier, 45; Michael Lee Evans, 72; Bryan Hagerich and Ryan Tyler Watson, 40. Each is accused of bringing various amounts of ammunition to the chain of 40 islands in the tropical Atlantic Ocean southeast of the Bahamas. The judge in the case is set to hand down Wenrich\u2019s sentence on May 28, Brooks said. According to Brooks, an expedited application was submitted on behalf of Watson, who will also have a hearing on May 28. Bringing firearms or ammunition, including stray bullets, into Turks and Caicos without prior permission from police is \u201cstrictly forbidden,\u201d according to a statement from its government. People who violate the law face a minimum of 12 years in prison, the US Embassy in the Bahamas said in an April advisory.

{"id": "2024_05_20_middleeast_netanyahu-sinwar-icc-arrest-warrants-explainer-intl", "text": "The prosecutor at the International Criminal Court (ICC) is seeking arrest warrants for top Hamas and Israeli figures on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity over the October 7 attacks on Israel and the subsequent war in Gaza. If approved by a panel of judges, the arrest warrants would be issued for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. Warrants are also being sought for three top Hamas officials: Gaza leader Yahya Sinwar, political chief Ismail Haniyah, and Mohammed Diab Ibrahim al-Masri, the leader of Hamas\u2019 armed wing, who is better known as Mohammed Deif. Here\u2019s what we know about the ICC cases and what they mean for Israel and Hamas. How would an arrest warrant affect Netanyahu or Hamas leaders? The decision to seek arrest warrants doesn\u2019t immediately mean the individual is guilty, but is the first stage in a process that could lead to a lengthy trial. If the court finds sufficient evidence of crimes, it can summon the suspect to appear voluntarily. The court can also issue an arrest warrant, relying on member countries to make the arrest and transfer the suspect to the ICC. If the suspect appears before the court, a pre-trial takes place in which the court decides if there is enough evidence for the case to go to trial. Then there is a trial before three ICC judges, in which the prosecution must prove \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d that the individual is guilty of the crimes. Once a verdict passes, the charged individual may be sentenced to up to 30 years in prison. Under exceptional circumstances, a life sentence can also be given, the court says. The ICC has so far issued arrest warrants against 42 people, 21 of whom have been detained with the help of member states. \u201cThe immediate problem for Israeli officials under any ICC arrest warrant would be that the court\u2019s 124 member states would be under a legal obligation to arrest such officials if they traveled to any of those 124 countries,\u201d Chile Eboe-Osuji, a former ICC president, wrote this month in Foreign Policy magazine. \u201cThat obligation should not be underestimated,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cjust last year, Putin canceled his plans to attend the BRICS summit in South Africa, in the apparent light of Pretoria\u2019s obligation to arrest him.\u201d Of Hamas leaders for whom arrest warrants are sought, two \u2013 Sinwar and Deif \u2013 are believed to be in Gaza, while Haniyah resides in Qatar, which is not a signatory to the Rome Statute. What is the ICC and who can it indict? Headquartered at The Hague in the Netherlands, the ICC was established in 2002 and is tasked with prosecuting individuals for crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. Unlike the International Court of Justice (ICJ), the ICC is not an organ of the United Nations and does not prosecute states. While the ICC is independent of the UN, it is endorsed by the UN\u2019s General Assembly and maintains a cooperation agreement with the UN. When a case is not within the ICC\u2019s jurisdiction, the UN Security Council can refer that case to the ICC, granting it jurisdiction. The court can investigate alleged crimes committed on the territory, or by a national, of any state that has accepted the court\u2019s jurisdiction by signing the Rome Statute, the treaty that established the ICC. Any member state can ask the ICC\u2019s prosecutor to launch an investigation. The court has previously issued arrest warrants against high-ranking individuals, including former Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir, Saif Gadhafi, the son of the late Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, and most recently, Russian President Vladimir Putin. Signatory states\u00a0are obliged\u00a0to apprehend those facing arrest warrants, but leaders have often sought to evade those warrants, restricting their freedom of movement. The ICC does not have its own enforcement mechanism and has relied on countries\u2019 support for arrests. Does the ICC have jurisdiction over Israeli nationals? Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza were referred to the ICC by five countries \u2013 South Africa, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Comoros and Djibouti \u2013 in November, calling on the court to investigate the possible crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, among others, in the Palestinian territories, and asked it to determine whether \u201cone or more specific persons should be charged.\u201d Israel does not recognize the jurisdiction of the ICC as it hasn\u2019t signed the Rome Statute. But that doesn\u2019t mean its citizens cannot be prosecuted by the court. The court had already been investigating possible crimes committed by Israel since 2014 in Gaza, the occupied West Bank and occupied East Jerusalem. The investigation began in March 2021, and was referred to the court by the Palestinian Authority, which adopted the ICC\u2019s mandate in 2015 as the State of Palestine. The ICC concluded then that it has jurisdiction on the conflict and, \u201cby majority, that the territorial scope of this jurisdiction extends to Gaza and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem.\u201d That investigation, ICC prosecutor Karim Khan said, \u201cis ongoing and extends to the escalation of hostilities and violence since the attacks that took place on 7 October 2023.\u201d Remarks by Netanyahu this month pointed to anxiety about the ICC probe. Issuing arrest warrants for Israeli officials would leave an \u201cindelible stain\u201d on the edifice of international law and justice, Netanyahu said, adding that the ICC was \u201cfounded as a consequence of the Holocaust\u201d and should not attempt to \u201cundermine\u201d Israel\u2019s fundamental right to self-defense. The ICC action comes as the International Court of Justice (ICJ), a different court in The Hague, considers a case brought by South Africa in which Israel is accused of committing genocide against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.\u00a0Israel recognizes the ICJ. Israel\u2019s war in Gaza, prompted by the October 7 Hamas attack that killed 1,200 people in Israel and took more than 250 others hostage, has dragged on for nearly eight months. More than 35,000 people have been killed during Israel\u2019s assault on Gaza, according to Palestinian authorities. Swathes of the territory have been reduced to rubble and more than half of its population of 2.3 million has been internally displaced. Famine has set in in parts of the strip. Does the ICC have jurisdiction over Hamas? Palestinian leaders signed up to the Rome Statute in 2015. As such, the ICC has jurisdiction over actors in Gaza and other Palestinian territories and by extension, over actors in those territories, including Hamas. ICC prosecutor Khan confirmed this in October, saying alleged crimes committed by Israel in Gaza, or by Hamas in Israel, fall under the court\u2019s jurisdiction, Reuters reported. This means the court can indict Hamas leaders over possible crimes committed against both Israelis and Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. Shelly Aviv Yeini, head of the international law department at the Israeli Hostage and Missing Families Forum, said the ICC could make Hamas accountable for crimes even if the state of Israel does not recognize the authority of the court. \u201cWe are an NGO, a private entity,\u201d Yeini told CNN earlier, as the families of hostages held by Gaza gathered to submit a complaint against Hamas to the ICC. \u201cWe can bring about a claim in the name of the hostages even if the state (Israel) doesn\u2019t recognize its (the ICC\u2019s) jurisdiction.\u201d ICC prosecutor Khan said Monday he is seeking the warrants \u201con the basis of evidence collected and examined by my office,\u201d and thanked families of the hostages \u201cfor their courage in coming forward to provide their accounts.\u201d According to Article 15 of the ICC Rome Statue, any individual, group, or organization can file complaints of potential crimes to the court. A member of the Hamas political bureau, Muhammad Nazzal, told CNN in February that going to the ICC was \u201ca mistake\u201d that would stall negotiations to return the hostages. \u201cThe shortest way to return their prisoners is to complete the ongoing negotiating process,\u201d the Hamas member told CNN at the time. How have Hamas, Israel and others reacted to the ICC\u2019s action? Both Hamas and Israeli politicians denounced the ICC\u2019s move. Hamas said it was an attempt to \u201cequate victims with aggressors by issuing arrest warrants against a number of Palestinian resistance leaders without legal basis.\u201d The militant group said warrant requests for Netanyahu and Gallant had come \u201cseven months late,\u201d referring to the duration of Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. Israeli politicians across the political spectrum condemned\u00a0the\u00a0decision. Foreign Minister Israel Katz called it a \u201cscandalous decision\u201d and an \u201cunrestrained frontal attack on the victims of October 7 and our 128 hostages in Gaza.\u201d The leader of the opposition, Yair Lapid, called it \u201ca complete moral failure\u201d and said Israel \u201ccannot accept the outrageous comparison between Netanyahu and Sinwar.\u201d The right-wing minister for National Security, Itamar Ben Gvir, accused the ICC of antisemitism and called for an escalation of attacks against Hamas, while Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said: \u201cWe have not seen such a show of hypocrisy and hatred of Jews as that of the Hague Tribunal since Nazi propaganda.\u201d CNN has reached out to the Prime Minister\u2019s office and Defense Ministry. In the US, meanwhile, President Joe Biden has denounced the ICC prosecutor\u2019s move, calling it \u201coutrageous.\u201d \u201cLet me be clear: whatever this prosecutor might imply, there is no equivalence \u2014 none \u2014 between Israel and Hamas,\u201d the president wrote. \u201cWe will always stand with Israel against threats to its security.\u201d Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the US \u201cfundamentally rejects\u201d the ICC prosecutor\u2019s announcement and warned it could \u201cjeopardize\u201d efforts to reach a ceasefire and hostage release agreement. \u201cWe reject the prosecutor\u2019s equivalence of Israel with Hamas.\u00a0It is shameful.\u00a0Hamas is a brutal terrorist organization that carried out the worst massacre of Jews since the Holocaust and is still holding dozens of innocent people hostage, including Americans,\u201d Blinken said in a statement. He questioned \u201cthe legitimacy and credibility of this investigation,\u201d and said the US believed the ICC to have \u201cno jurisdiction over this matter.\u201d The US is not a signatory to the Rome Statute.

{"id": "travel_anantara-santorini-abu-dhabi-uae", "text": "White, domed buildings cascading into crystal blue waters. To the eye, it\u2019s unmistakable. It\u2019s the world-famous holiday destination of Santorini, Greece. But, something feels different. Perhaps it\u2019s the hotter desert-climate breeze, or the Arabic calligraphy across the signage. A few hints here and there point towards the resort\u2019s actual location: Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates. The Anantara Santorini Abu Dhabi Retreat opened in February this year and is an hour\u2019s drive away from the capital\u2019s downtown. The concept is entirely inspired by the renowned Greek island. Inside and out, it\u2019s a world of white, beige and blue, marked by arched corridors and doorways. Its bespoke artwork, ambient music and detailed embroidery on the linen all add up to a Mediterranean fantasy. Yet, beyond the intricate d\u00e9cor, for Rachid Bakas, the property\u2019s general manager, it\u2019s Abu Dhabi\u2019s natural beauty that truly draws the link between both locations. \u201cYou see the color of the sea next to us, and then the concept really comes together,\u201d says Bakas. \u201cThe idea of Santorini really fits within this location, and that\u2019s what makes this design immaculate.\u201d Not \u2018Chinatown\u2019 or \u2018Disneyland\u2019 Replicas are not usually marketed as a luxurious experience. But, Anantara Santorini could be an exception. Its lowest-priced room costs approximately $800 per night. That\u2019s double the average of Greece\u2019s Santorini hotels during high season, according to Tripadvisor. If the price isn\u2019t an advantage, why would a traveler prefer to visit the hotel in Abu Dhabi, and not fly to Greece? \u201cIt\u2019s exclusive,\u201d says Bakas. \u201cThis gives you that intimacy, this gives you that privacy. It\u2019s a hideaway \u2013 which you might not have actually in Santorini because especially in summer, everywhere is packed, everywhere is busy.\u201d Structurally, the hotel is divided into 22 rooms, accommodating a maximum of 44 guests at a time. All rooms lead to a living room-like common area, purposefully giving a very homey atmosphere, while encouraging visitors to walk through the facility\u2019s different environments. \u201cThe element of surprise is within the hotel itself and from the moment you walk, you keep discovering some nice corners and spaces,\u201d says Bakas. Anantara Santorini offers a range of experiences, including a cigar lounge, a cinema, a spa and yoga sessions by the pool or beach. Yet, more than entertainment, the hope is that guests can simply enjoy calmness and tranquility. \u201cSometimes, people just want to be left alone, they don\u2019t want to be asked to do activities all the time, and this is the balance that we offer,\u201d the manager explains. One more factor contributes to the facility\u2019s quietness: a restricted age group. The minimum age for check-in is 18, even if accompanied by parents or guardians. \u201cYou can really unwind, and feel away, and relax,\u201d Bakas says. \u201cIt was not an easy decision, but we really wanted to be on a different level [than other resorts in the region].\u201d Fifty shades of white While hoping to leave an impression on the guests, the hotel staff also work hard to remove certain marks. The white walls are kept impeccably white, and there\u2019s a team dedicated to just that. \u201cWe have two painters on site, and their daily job is to go around and do touch-ups,\u201d Bakas reveals. The painters go around the rooms in between check-outs and check-ins, making sure all the surroundings are not gray, beige or eggshell \u2013 just white. \u201cAfter the touch-ups, you need to make sure that the color looks the same, we want to make sure people don\u2019t see different strokes, so really, it\u2019s a crazy big part of our preventive maintenance,\u201d Bakas sighs, as he looks at the walls and ceilings, with a smile.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/anantara-santorini-abu-dhabi-uae/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "world"}}

Millions in the region must remain weather aware Monday and Tuesday after powerful storms battered parts of the region Sunday with damaging tornadoes, baseball-sized hail and winds up to 100 mph. At least 13 tornadoes were reported across Kansas, Colorado and Oklahoma on Sunday, according to the Storm Prediction Center. Two tornadoes struck Oklahoma, one of which triggered a rare tornado emergency in Custer City and damaged 10 to 15 homes in Custer County and another hit the western portions of Oklahoma City. Two people were injured in Blaine County, Oklahoma, when their mobile home was destroyed and a local nursing home also reported damage, according to state and county officials. Custer County also reported two people with injuries, the state emergency management office said.

Tornadoes, some of which could be strong, are possible in much of Iowa. Smaller parts of Wisconsin, Illinois and Missouri could also face dangerous tornadoes. Sweltering heat\u00a0in Houston amid days-long outages Houston area residents who are still picking up the pieces from Thursday\u2019s storms will contend with a much different danger: sweltering heat. Winds up to 100 mph and a tornado in Harris County killed at least eight people, damaged skyscrapers, toppled trees, downed critical power infrastructure, caused a sewage spill and made roads impassable. The heat index, which measures what the body actually feels, could hit triple-digits this week, raising health risks from weather\u2019s deadliest threat. Power remains out for more than 200,000 homes and business across Harris County as of Monday afternoon, according to PowerOutage.us. With increasingly high heat and humidity, those residents will have to cope with heat indices from the 90s Monday into the 100s Tuesday and Wednesday without air conditioning. Authorities have warned restoring power to all customers could take weeks. \u201cWidespread power outages continue across the Houston metro area.

The blaze was still burning on Wednesday afternoon, more than 24 hours after it began, and authorities and citizens in the Danish capital have started reckoning with the loss of one of the city\u2019s most recognizable landmarks. Local firefighters continued to try to put out the fire, which ripped through\u00a0the building \u2013 known locally as B\u00f8rsen \u2013\u00a0from early Tuesday, reaching all its floors and causing the collapse of a dragon-tail spire that had long been a symbol of the city. The walls of the building are still standing, but the interior has been significantly damaged and the roof is partially collapsed. Firefighters used cranes to hose water down into the building. Copenhagen\u00a0police meanwhile launched an investigation on Wednesday, which they said will be a \u201ccomplicated process.\u201d Police officer Brian Belling said authorities have already \u201cconducted interviews, secured surveillance and carried out a large number of investigative steps.\u201d \u201cBut of course, there is still a lot to do, especially as we have not yet had the opportunity to examine\u00a0B\u00f8rsen itself,\u201d Belling added. The 17th century building exemplified the style of the Dutch Renaissance, and housed a number of artworks, some of which were saved on Tuesday. Residents were stunned by the outbreak, which brought back memories of the fire that tore through the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris exactly five years and a day earlier. \u201cMy first thought was (that) I hope that they rebuild it \u2013 it\u2019s never going to be the same but it\u2019s iconic to\u00a0Copenhagen\u00a0and Denmark,\u201d teacher Eva Simoni Lomholdt, 58, told Reuters. Brian Mikkelsen, the CEO of the Danish Chamber of Commerce which owns the building, told the news agency that a firefighter gave him the top of the spire on Wednesday morning after it was recovered following its fall. \u201cIt gives me hope because we have decided to rebuild the stock exchange because it\u2019s part of European history as a trading continent,\u201d he said. The old stock exchange \u2013 located only a few minutes walk from Christiansborg\u00a0Palace \u2013 dates back to 1625. It was built in the Dutch Renaissance style at the request of King Christian IV and had recently been undergoing renovations with its facade covered in scaffolding and protective coverings. It has been at the heart of Danish business since then; while it no longer houses the Danish stock exchange, it serves as the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce.

{"id": "2024_05_20_middleeast_amal-clooney-icc-arrest-warrant-israel-hamas-gaza-intl-latam", "text": "Human rights attorney Amal Clooney is among a group of legal experts who advised the International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor to seek arrest warrants against the top leaders of Israel and Hamas. The panel was convened by the ICC prosecutor Karim Khan and tasked to review the evidence and legal analysis underpinning his application for warrants against three Hamas leaders and two Israeli politicians, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. It issued a detailed legal report on Monday, which said the panel found \u201creasonable grounds to believe\u201d that the individuals named in the arrest warrants have committed war crimes or crimes against humanity. Clooney, who has represented victims of mass atrocities, faced online criticism prior to her announcement for not speaking about Israel\u2019s siege on Gaza. In a statement shared on her Clooney Foundation for Justice website on Monday, she explained how she had found herself advising Khan. \u201cMore than four months ago, the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court asked me to assist him with evaluating evidence of suspected war crimes and crimes against humanity in Israel and Gaza,\u201d the statement said. \u201cI agreed and joined a panel of international legal experts to undertake this task.\u201d She said the panel\u2019s findings were \u201cunanimous\u201d despite their diverse backgrounds. \u201cI served on this panel because I believe in the rule of law and the need to protect civilian lives. The law that protects civilians in war was developed more than 100 years ago and it applies in every country in the world regardless of the reasons for a conflict,\u201d Clooney said in the statement. The eight-person legal panel consisted of renowned legal experts, including Theodor Meron, former President of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, and Lord Justice Fulford, a former ICC judge. They \u201cunanimously determined\u201d that the court had jurisdiction over crimes committed in Palestinian territories and by Palestinian nationals, Clooney\u2019s statement wrote. The panel also was unanimous in concluding that \u201cHamas leaders Yahya Sinwar, Mohammed Deif and Ismail Haniyeh have committed war crimes and crimes against humanity, including hostage-taking, murder and crimes of sexual violence.\u201d Clooney\u2019s statement added there was also \u201creasonable grounds to believe\u201d Netanyahu and \u201cIsraeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant have committed war crimes and crimes against humanity including starvation as a method of warfare, murder, persecution and extermination.\u201d A panel of ICC judges will now consider Khan\u2019s application for the arrest warrants. Both Hamas and Israeli politicians condemned the arrest warrants, with Netanyahu calling it a \u201ctravesty of justice\u201d and an \u201coutrageous decision\u201d that \u201ccreates a twisted and false moral equivalence between the leaders of Israel and the henchmen of Hamas.\u201d The application for warrants marks the first time the ICC has targeted the top leader of a close ally of the United States. Israel and the US are not members of the ICC. However, the ICC claims to have jurisdiction over Gaza, East Jerusalem, and the West Bank after Palestinian leaders formally agreed to be bound by the court\u2019s founding principles in 2015. The Biden administration on Monday forcefully denounced the ICC\u2019s move, with President Joe Biden saying in a statement: \u201cWhatever this prosecutor might imply, there is no equivalence \u2013 none \u2013 between Israel and Hamas.\u201d Clooney, who is a barrister at Doughty Street Chambers in London and an adjunct professor at Columbia Law School, is married to the actor George Clooney. Alongside her husband, she co-founded the Clooney Foundation for Justice, which gives free legal support to victims of abuses of power, according to its website. She has represented Yazidi victims of genocide \u201cin the only three genocide cases against ISIS members in the world,\u201d according to the website.

In a post on X, Duckworth said she was \u201cbeyond relieved that Dr. Hamawy \u2013 and his entire team \u2013 safely left Gaza today and that he will be able to see his family again soon.\u201d Hamawy previously turned down an evacuation offer, refusing to leave his non-US colleagues behind, who\u00a0weren\u2019t afforded the option to leave earlier. \u201cIt was only US citizens who could leave. There were spots for 20 people, and there are 20 US citizens. No one else could go. It was that simple,\u201d Hamawy told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s a basic doctor concept for me as a US former service member that you don\u2019t leave your teammates behind. On leaving Gaza, Hamawy told CNN,\u00a0\u201cWe are glad that we are out and that we all left together. Our hearts are with the people who still have to endure and cannot leave.\u201d \u201cWe hope that medical relief is allowed to replace us soon and a permanent ceasefire puts an end to this nightmare.\u201d The evacuation was a multi-lateral effort involving Jordan and the US. Australian, Egyptian, Irish and Omani nationals were among the evacuees.\u00a0The team were told to follow a specific route to the\u00a0Kerem Shalom crossing and were taken by the Jordanian military to the King Hussein Bridge. On May 19, Hamawy wrote a letter to US President Joe Biden\u00a0detailing the realities on the ground. \u201cI have never in my career witnessed the level of atrocities and targeting of my medical colleagues as I have in Gaza.\u201d He\u00a0urged Biden and the international community to allow free passage for medical personnel into Gaza, adding: \u201cThe children of Palestine are not safe. Civilians, population centers, are not safe. We, as humanitarian workers, are not safe. You have the power to end the invasion of Rafah and Gaza now.\u201d The group were working with the Palestine American Medical Association under the umbrella of the World Health Organization at the European Hospital in northern Rafah. While the hospital wasn\u2019t ordered to evacuate, Hamawy was \u201coften awakened by a strike that [shook] the whole hospital.\u201d In his letter to Biden he added, \u201cWe are hearing bombs drop around us more frequently, amidst thousands of sheltering civilians. The streams of patients, mostly children, are rising faster than we can keep up with fewer medical staff.\u201d More than 35,000 people have been killed in Israel\u2019s seven-month military offensive, most of them women and children, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. According to Hamawy, the European Hospital is \u201cthe last standing hospital that\u2019s functionating like a functional medical center.\u201d Many hospitals have been forced to evacuate and, \u201cthe ones before them have all been raided and destroyed.\u201d No medical team replaced the healthcare professionals who evacuated Tuesday, leaving the hospital with even fewer workers to look after patients with increasingly fewer resources.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/middleeast/european-hospital-gaza-medics-freed-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "world"}}

The huia was last officially spotted in the early 20th century and its feathers have previously sold for up to $8,400 NZD (about $5,100), according to Webb\u2019s Auction House. The huia bird feather, which was expected to sell for up to $3,000 NZD ($1,830), smashed the estimate on Monday to become the world\u2019s most expensive feather ever sold, Webb\u2019s Auction House said. \u201cThis rare huia feather is a beautiful example of Aotearoa\u2019s natural history and reminds us of the fragility of our ecosystem,\u201d\u00a0Leah Morris, head of decorative arts at the Auckland-based auction house, said in a statement. \u2018Lethal popularity\u2019 A member of the wattle-bird family, the huia was prized by many people - ultimately proving fatal for the species. For Maori, the bird\u2019s feathers were a mark of high status and the distinctive, white-tipped plumage were used for ceremonial headdresses. Only those of chiefly rank were permitted to wear huia feathers in their hair or whole skins in their ears, \ufeffaccording to the Museum of New Zealand. The feathers were often traded for other valuable goods or given as gifts to demonstrate friendship and respect, the auction house said. European New Zealanders also came to see the huia as a symbol of prestige. They used the animal\u2019s feathers for fashion accessories and stuffed huia were mounted as decoration in wealthy homes, according to the museum. The museum explains that Maori\u00a0and European\u00a0hunters killed the bird in \u201cgreat numbers\u201d during the 19th century, selling the skin to collectors and fashion merchants. The huia\u2019s \u201clethal popularity\u201d reportedly grew even more when the\u00a0Duke and Duchess of York were photographed\u00a0wearing feathers in their hats during a trip to New Zealand in 1901. \u201cPeople kind of had a frenzy and decided that everyone wanted a huia feather,\u201d said Morris of the event. Attempts made by scientists in the early 1900s to conserve the remaining huia failed. A government plan to ship the birds to offshore islands resulted in those who collected the birds to sell them as dead specimens, according to the museum, adding It was more \u201cprofitable\u201d than keeping them alive. The auction house said that all prospective buyers were required to provide a permit from New Zealand\u2019s Ministry for Culture and Heritage in advance of Monday\u2019s sale. As an object of national importance, the feather could only be purchased by registered collectors and cannot leave the country without permission from the ministry. The sale follows that of a Victorian pair of taxi-dermied huia which sold for $457,704 (about $280,000) at a UK auction last year, according to the auction house.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/style/huia-feather-sold-new-zealand-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_17_weather_flooding-south-storms-houston-friday", "text": "At least seven people were killed in the Houston area on Thursday as a destructive complex of storms with winds up to 100 mph tore through the area, triggering power outages that could stretch on for weeks amid soaring temperatures. The death toll rose Friday evening from the four fatalities officials reported earlier in the day. More than 900,000 homes and businesses lost power in Houston\u2019s Harris County during the peak of the storm\u2019s violent winds, and nearly 600,000 remained in the dark Friday evening, according to PowerOutage.us. \u201cFor some folks, the luckier ones, (power restoration) might be days, not hours. For many, many people, it\u2019s going to be weeks and not days,\u201d Harris County Judge Lina Hildago said in a Friday news briefing. Hidalgo said the weeks-long restoration timeframe was for homes and businesses tied into the 10 steel power transmission towers downed in the state, seven of which were in Harris County. It\u2019s unclear which areas are tied into the transmission lines, she said. It\u2019s a troubling timeframe for power restoration, especially as high temperatures reach the 90s through the weekend and beyond. The heat index, which measures what the body actually feels, could hit the triple-digits by next week, raising health risks from weather\u2019s deadliest threat. The City of Houston planned to activate cooling centers for residents on Friday, officials said in a news release. Fallen trees appear to have caused two of the reported deaths, and a crane accident caused another, Houston Fire Department Chief Samuel Pe\u00f1a said in a news conference. The Harris County Sheriff\u2019s Office on Friday evening identified three others in the county who died from the storm. One man collapsed while attempting to move a downed electrical pole, and a woman died after lightning struck the trailer she was inside and caused a fire, Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said in a post on X Friday. Gonzales said another victim who had lost power reportedly went out to his truck to plug in his oxygen tank. \u201cHe was found unresponsive this morning and pronounced deceased at the scene,\u201d the sheriff said Friday, adding the additional deaths occurred in unincorporated Harris County. Houston Mayor John Whitmire, who signed a local state of disaster declaration for the city on Friday, toured the downtown area and said the \u201cdevastation is significant.\u201d \u201cWe urge everyone to stay away from the area for your safety and to allow public works personnel to do their vital jobs,\u201d Whitmire said.  Additional powerful, drenching storms could plague parts of the Gulf Coast Friday. Here\u2019s the latest on Friday\u2019s storms and destruction in Texas and other parts of the South: Thursday\u2019s severe weather classified as derecho: The weather service classified the line of severe storms that moved through Texas and Louisiana as a derecho, a potentially destructive weather event characterized by widespread wind damage associated with a long-lived line of thunderstorms. Derechos have consistent wind gusts of 58 mph or greater along a path of at least 400 miles, along with several well-separated wind gusts of greater than 75 mph. The Storm Prediction Center and several National Weather Service offices made the determination based on the path\u2019s length and intensity. Most of Houston\u2019s traffic lights are down: Traffic lights across the city are out and debris from damaged buildings and toppled trees are covering roadways, making driving conditions dangerous. \u201cDowntown is a mess. It\u2019s dangerous due to the glass and the lack of traffic lights. So stay at home,\u201d Mayor Whitmire said Thursday. Hurricane-force wind gusts reported in Texas and Louisiana: Wind speeds reached as high as 100 mph in downtown Houston, a National Weather Service storm damage survey crew determined Friday. Wind gusts of 74 to 78 mph were measured just east of the Houston metro\u00a0Thursday evening,\u00a0according to the weather service. The National Weather Service in New Orleans reported wind gusts as strong as 84 mph around the city. Major flooding leads to water rescues: There were up to 20 water rescues after residents in Bryan, Texas, drove into the floodwaters, police spokesperson Seth Waller said. Nearby in College Station, heavy rain Thursday flooded a park, videos shared with CNN showed. Roads flooded in several Texas counties including Bosque, Bell, McLennan and Falls. Waterlogged parts of Texas and Louisiana recorded widespread rainfall amounts of 2 to 4 inches in just a few hours late Thursday and early Friday morning. Spate of storms exhausts Texas: The Lone Star State has been in the bull\u2019s-eye of seemingly unrelenting rounds of flooding downpours. Gov. Greg Abbott on Wednesday requested a presidential disaster declaration for areas impacted by the onslaught of severe weather and flooding, citing \u201cextensive damage caused by these severe storms, historic river flooding, and tornadoes\u201d that began on April 26. Houston area bears brunt of destructive storms Houston\u2019s mayor advised residents to stay off the roads and stay at home because of widespread damage to the area. \u201cMany roads are impassable due to downed power lines, debris, and fallen trees,\u201d Mayor Whitmire\u2019s office said in a statement Thursday evening. The storm was so powerful it blew out the windows of buildings in downtown Houston, littering the area with glass as traffic lights went dark. Shoppers at a Costco in Houston used their phones as the only source of light as they huddled inside the store when the power went out, with employees closing the doors to block out the rain and winds. The violent storm conditions partially collapsed a nightclub and partially ripped roofing off the downtown Hyatt Regency, showering the hotel lobby with rain and debris, according to witness video. CenterPoint Energy says its skyscraper in downtown Houston sustained damage from the storm, according to a spokesperson. The Houston Independent School District announced campuses will be closed on Friday and reopen Monday \u201cdue to widespread damage across Houston.\u201d More than a dozen Houston-area school districts also announced they would close Friday, including Aldine Independent School District, Channelview Independent School District and Cypress-Fairbanks Independent School District. More damaging storms possible Friday Damaging, soaking storms were ongoing in parts of the Gulf Coast Friday morning following Thursday night\u2019s violent weather. Additional storms will usher in renewed threats later Friday. A Level 2 of 5 risk of severe thunderstorms is in place from southern Louisiana to parts of Georgia and Florida. Any of these storms could produce damaging wind gusts, hail and even a tornado. Storms will also unload gushing rainfall. A Level 3 of 4 risk of flooding rainfall is in place for portions of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. The heaviest rain late Friday will likely fall during the overnight hours. Storms could produce rainfall rates of 2 to 3 inches per hour and quickly restart or worsen any ongoing flooding. Widespread rainfall totals of 2 to 6 inches are expected from Texas to Georgia through Saturday morning. A few spots caught under multiple torrential storms may pick up 8 inches or more of rain. Some areas could record close to a foot of rain in about 48 hours.

{"id": "2024_05_16_europe_robert-fico-shooting-analysis-violent-attacks-intl-cmd", "text": "The horrific scenes in Slovakia following the assassination attempt on Prime Minister Robert Fico are a stark and brutal reminder of the dangers facing those who seek public office. Fico, a pro-Russia left-wing populist, was recovering Thursday after being shot multiple times in the stomach. Government ministers closely aligned with the prime minister quickly called the shooting \u201cpolitically motivated,\u201d pointing the finger of blame for the toxic political atmosphere at the opposition and the media. But Fico himself has been guilty of using emotive language in the past. He claimed the country\u2019s outgoing progressive President Zuzana \u010caputov\u00e1 was an \u201cAmerican agent\u201d and accused her \u2014 without any proof \u2014 of acting in the interests of the US financier George Soros, a frequent target for\u00a0conspiracy\u00a0theories. \u010caputov\u00e1\u2019s allies said the comments have led to death threats. The issue is obviously not isolated to Slovakia. Politics across Europe and elsewhere have become bitterly divided over the past decade, with far-right and radical left-wing populists increasing their influence both in domestic politics and at a European level. Ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza have added to these tensions, as citizens look to their leaders to take a stand on highly contentious issues. These tensions exist in the same space as a political system that obliges elected officials to meet and mix with the people who vote them into office. The shooting came at a time of extreme political divisions over Slovakia\u2019s position in the world and its future. Fico is, and has always been, a highly divisive politician. His supporters see him as a caring leader who has their interests at heart. His opponents say he is a corrupt populist whose pro-Russian leanings pose major risks. Fico\u2019s comments prompted \u010caputov\u00e1 to take legal action against Fico, suing him for defamation. Despite being one of the most popular Slovakian politicians, \u010caputov\u00e1 announced last year that she would be stepping down and would not run again. She specifically cited verbal attacks against her and her family as being among the reasons why she felt she \u201cdidn\u2019t have enough strength\u201d to serve for another term. The assassination attempt against Fico came as his coalition government is trying to push through a number of divisive measures, sparking months of large-scale peaceful protests. Fico\u2019s attempts to overhaul the criminal justice system are particularly controversial. The government is seeking to reduce penalties for corruption and has abolished the special prosecutor\u2019s office, which was tasked with investigating serious and politically sensitive corruption cases, including some that concerned people directly connected to Fico and his party, SMER. The government is also trying to shut down the public service broadcaster RTVS, planning to replace it with a new national broadcaster, which would be under tighter control of the government. That plan has sparked large-scale protests in Slovakia. Slovakia is not unique in its political divisions and move towards populism. Only this week, the Netherlands came one step closer to having a coalition government with a far-right party at its helm. In 2022, Giorgia Meloni became Italy\u2019s prime minister after running on an anti-immigration, socially conservative ticket. While both these leaders are on the right and Fico is on the left, specific definitions between the left and right are becoming less helpful across Europe in the context of populism. The swing towards populism is expected to play out in the European Parliamentary elections next month. Current polls suggest there will be enough far-right Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) that they will be able to block legislation. Political division, emotive overseas conflicts, high levels of migration and struggling economies all add to a pressure cooker that makes it dangerous to be a politician these days. Politicians are especially vulnerable to violent attacks for a few reasons. They are people whose position gives them a public platform that isn\u2019t dissimilar to that of a minor celebrity. Unlike minor celebrities, they are human representations of policies that people have extremely strong feelings about. If a politician belongs to a party that won\u2019t call for an immediate ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, they support genocide in the eyes of some voters. If a politician supported Covid lockdowns, they stripped people of their liberties, in some people\u2019s thinking. If an elected representative wants to keep funding Ukraine rather than encourage talks with Russia, some will see them as a warmonger thwarting peace. Politicians are also obliged to mix with the general public. In Britain, two sitting parliamentarians were murdered while holding meetings with the people they represented. In 2016, Jo Cox, a left-wing MP who had spoken in support of Syrian refugees, was killed by a far-right white supremacist. David Amess, a Conservative MP, was killed while meeting constituents at a church hall by an ISIS sympathiser. The threat of violence can be felt by politicians far beyond\u2019s Europe\u2019s borders. Former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was shot dead in July 2022 as he gave a campaign speech. Last year, Ecuadorian presidential candidate Fernando Villavicencio \u2013 an anti-corruption campaigner and lawmaker \u2013 was shot dead during a campaign rally, 10 days before the first round of voting. As long as they have these obligations to meet and mix, there is no amount of security that would completely remove this risk for politicians. Besides, limiting access to politicians could make the disconnect between the public and their elected representatives even worse. Finally, if you are someone looking to make a political point through a public act of violence, then who better than the human representation of what you oppose? It may be horrible to admit that politically motivated violence against a politician is an effective way of gaining attention for your cause, but that is the calculation that those who carry out these attacks will make. Attacking a random member of the public will not attract the media attention that attacking a politician will. Targeting someone with a public profile who actually represents something means that you can claim to be a political martyr rather than a simple murderer. There are two obvious ways of reducing this risk: restricting access to politicians and obtaining better intelligence on potential attackers. The first, while probably more effective, runs the risk of further alienating the public from their leaders. The second is time-consuming, requires increased investment in intelligence and security operations and results are not guaranteed. The third, less obvious, way of improving the situation is to lower the temperature of political discourse. In the days following the attack on Fico\u2019s life, the public will likely hear politicians across Europe calling for civility in politics and condemning radicalism. Next month\u2019s European elections and the discourse in the run-up to them will show how serious they are about calming political tensions.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/europe/robert-fico-shooting-analysis-violent-attacks-intl-cmd/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_21_europe_depardieu-paparazzi-harrys-bar-rome-intl-latam", "text": "In a scene reminiscent of La Dolce Vita era, French actor Gerard Depardieu has been accused of attacking celebrity photographer Rino Barillari outside Harry\u2019s Bar on the famed Via Veneto in Rome. Depardieu was dining at an outdoor table with a female companion and two other people around 2 p.m. local time on Tuesday when Barillari \u2013 known as \u201cthe king\u201d in Roman press circles \u2013 apparently snapped the diners, according to Italian media reports. Exactly what happened next is a matter of dispute, though both sides say they have filed police reports known locally as denouncements. Barillari, age 79, said Depardieu\u2019s partner Magda Vavrusova jumped up and started punching him before Depardieu joined the fight, according to Barillari\u2019s lawyer, as cited in several Italian media outlets including the Messaggero newspaper where Barillari works. Police confirmed to CNN that \u201ca local photographer\u201d had filed a complaint around an incident at Harry\u2019s Bar on Tuesday, but did not divulge the names of those involved. Piero Lepore, the owner of Harry\u2019s Bar in Rome, confirmed to CNN that the incident happened, but did not cast blame. Barillari often captures celebrities dining at the establishment, which is famous for appearing in the 1960 Federico Fellini film \u201cLa Dolce Vita\u201d \u2013 whose photographer character Paparazzo is reputed to have inspired the term \u201cpaparazzi.\u201d \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen fisticuffs here in two decades. This sort of thing never happens here,\u201d Lepore told CNN by telephone. \u201cWe are used to celebrities and we are used to paparazzi \u2013 they can\u2019t survive without each other. But we are no longer used to these fights.\u201d When asked for details, he said that because there was now a denouncement by Barillari, he could not comment. \u201cI gave my testimony to the police. I can\u2019t say any more.\u201d Barillari was taken to hospital by ambulance, according to Lepore. Magda Vavrusova\u2019s lawyer, Delphine Meillet,\u00a0said in a statement to CNN that it was Barillari who had pushed Vavrusova. Meillet told the Adnkronos news agency that Vavrusova filed a denouncement with Rome police stating: \u201cThe photographer pushed me, touching my torso and chest with his arm. At this moment in which I present the complaint I still feel pain, it was very violent.\u201d Meillet told the news agency that Vavrusova was also in the hospital, though calls to the University Policlinico Umberto did not confirm her as a patient. Meillet also told the news outlet that in fact Depardieu had run to intervene after the photographer attacked his companion and \u201cslipped and fell on him.\u201d CNN has also reached out to Depardieu\u2019s lawyer for comment. A spokesperson for Rome police said they are currently looking for surveillance footage from the area. Barillari got his start as a celebrity paparazzi when he was just 16 years old by delivering photos he had taken of celebrities at the Trevi Fountain to various news outlets, according to his biography. He has been to the emergency room 200 times after being attacked by his subjects, he said in a documentary to mark his 70th birthday nine years ago. He went on to become Rome\u2019s most infamous paparazzi, publishing several books of his images which have included popes, presidents and stars like Sylvester Stallone, Sharon Stone, Liz Taylor and Frank Sinatra, according to his bio. He has suffered 82 broken cameras, 11 broken ribs and a broken femur after photographing a local celebrity allegedly beating up his girlfriend in Piazza Navona, where he lives and keeps a photo studio. Depardieu\u2019s run-in with Barillari comes after the Paris prosecutor\u2019s office told CNN last month that the French actor \u2013 known for his roles in films like \u201cGreen Card,\u201d \u201cThe Man in the Iron Mask\u201d and \u201cLife of Pi\u201d \u2013 would face trial in October over allegations of sexual assault said to have taken place during the shooting of \u201cLes Volets Verts\u201d in 2021. The actor is also being formally investigated on suspicion of rape and sexual assault allegedly committed in August 2018 against actress Charlotte Arnould, the prosecutor\u2019s office said. The French actor has denied all the rape and sexual assault  accusations.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/europe/depardieu-paparazzi-harrys-bar-rome-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "world"}}

The delegation is expected to assess this week whether equipment and facilities for the foreign police forces are ready \u2013 an assessment which will be decisive in determining a timeline for the deployment, a source with knowledge of the preparations told CNN. Members of the delegation are also expected to meet with US and United Nations officials in the country, sources said. The UN Security Council\u00a0last year\u00a0authorized a multinational mission to support Haiti\u2019s National Police in battling deadly gangs that have seized control of much of the capital Port-au-Prince. But despite strong support from the US and other regional powers, the mission has been mired in uncertainty and legal challenges for months. It was further delayed following the resignation of former Haitian Prime Minister Ariel Henry in March, until the creation of a transitional governing council. The council said Tuesday that it met with top Haitian police brass to discuss the multinational mission. \u201cHaiti, through the Haitian National Police, will have overall control of all aspects of the field mission,\u201d including the mission\u2019s composition, aims, rules of engagement and health precautions, it emphasized in a statement on X. Kenya is currently finalizing preparations for the mission, the country\u2019s principal secretary of foreign affairs\u00a0Korir Sing\u2019Oei said Sunday, citing the successful creation of the council and other institutions in Haiti as key conditions. \u201cIn view of that and in view of the decision of the courts in our republic essentially guiding how Kenya should be able to carry out this deployment, lots of reciprocal agreements were entered into between Kenya and Haiti, which facilitates Kenya\u2019s ability to deploy. And we are in the process\u2014our government is in the process of finalizing preparation to deploy.\u201d A UN-managed trust fund for the mission currently contains $21 million, provided by Canada ($8.7 million), France ($3.2 million), Spain ($3 million) and the United States ($6 million). Personnel for the mission have been offered by the Bahamas, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belize, Benin, Chad and Jamaica, in addition to Kenya. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Tuesday defended US funding for the mission in a Senate Foreign Relations hearing, warning that Haiti is \u201con the precipice of becoming an all-out failed state\u201d without international support. \u201cI understand some of the skepticism that exists about another mission in Haiti, but I think what we have going for us is this: first, a general revulsion of the people at the direction that the country has taken, including gangs that are dominating Port-au-Price and trying to undermine governance, a democratic trajectory that\u2019s been disrupted by failing to have a government that actually has a clear mandate and all of that has also had the effect of interrupting development assistance, other forms of assistance that people so desperately need,\u201d he said. Haiti\u2019s National Police have already \u201ctaken back control of the airport and other critical infrastructure,\u201d he added. \u201cIn fact, today, commercial flights resumed in Haiti, and we anticipate that American carriers will begin flying again in the days ahead.\u201d US President Joe Biden will welcome Kenyan President William\u00a0Ruto and first lady Rachel\u00a0Ruto\u00a0to the White House on Thursday, with Haiti high on the expected agenda.

{"id": "2024_05_15_europe_slovakia-prime-minister-fico-shooting-intl", "text": "Slovakia\u2019s Prime Minister Robert Fico was rushed to hospital in critical condition on Wednesday after he was shot five times in an assassination attempt that shocked the country. The attack took place after an off-site government meeting in the central Slovak town of Handlova. The suspected gunman was among a small crowd of people waiting to greet the prime minister on the street outside the cultural center, where the meeting took place, local media reported. Footage from the scene shows the gunman approaching Fico and firing at him from close range across a security barrier. The injured prime minister is then seen being bundled into a vehicle by his staff, before it speeds away with him inside. Fico was taken to a local hospital and then transferred by helicopter to a major trauma center about 20 miles (30 kilometers) away in Banska Bystrica. No one else was injured in the attack, officials said. Both the country\u2019s Defense Minister Robert Kali\u0148\u00e1k and Interior Minister Mat\u00fa\u0161 \u0160utaj E\u0161tok called the shooting \u201cpolitically motivated,\u201d with \u0160utaj E\u0161tok saying that \u201cthe suspect made the decision to do it shortly after the presidential election.\u201d In an emotional news conference outside the hospital, the two ministers said Fico was \u201cfighting for his life\u201d after the shooting and had been, at that point, in surgery for three and half hours. Later in the evening, Slovakian deputy Prime Minister Tom\u00e1\u0161 Taraba said he believed the prime minister would survive following surgery that \u201cwent well\u201d and was \u201cnot in a life-threatening situation at this moment.\u201d \u201cI was very shocked and tried to contact people to figure out how serious his condition was,\u201d Taraba said in an interview with BBC\u2019s Newshour program on Wednesday, recalling the moment he heard about Fico\u2019s shooting. \u201cFortunately, as far as I know the operation went well and I guess in the end he will survive,\u201d he said. Taraba told the BBC that Fico \u201cwas heavily injured\u201d and a bullet \u201cwent through the stomach and the second one hit the joints.\u201d Fico is the most powerful lawmaker in Slovakia. Unlike the president, whose role has limited scope, the prime minister holds rank as the decision-making head of government. The official statement posted on Fico\u2019s official Facebook said the PM was taken to Banska Bystrica instead of the capital city of Bratislava because \u201can acute intervention\u201d was necessary. Handlova is about two hours\u2019 drive from the capital Bratislava. Slovak President Zuzana \u010caputov\u00e1 said the suspected gunman was detained by the police. She said law enforcement agencies will release more information when they can and asked the public not to spread unconfirmed rumors. \u010caputov\u00e1 condemned what she called a \u201cbrutal and reckless\u201d attack on the 59-year-old politician. Speaking at a news conference later in the afternoon, she said the shooting was \u201can attack on democracy as well.\u201d Slovakia\u2019s defense and interior ministers blamed rising hate speech and division for the political atmosphere in the country, which they said led to the assassination attempt. Speaking to reporters in front of the hospital where Fico is being treated, Defense Minister Kali\u0148\u00e1k\u00a0said: \u201cHate is not an answer to hate.\u201d Visibly shaken and struggling for words at multiple moments during the news conference, Kali\u0148\u00e1k\u00a0said it was \u201ctime for some people to have a hard look into the mirror.\u201d \u201cThere is no question that this was politically motivated. The inability to accept the choice of people, which some may not like \u2026 it leads to this,\u201d he said. Interior Minister \u0160utaj-E\u0161tok called for calm, saying \u201cthose who are endorsing this attack as well as those who are calling for some sort of a revenge. And I am asking you, the media too, please, use your power, your influence. Because until now, it was some of you who sow the hate,\u201d he said. Following the shooting, \u0160utaj-E\u0161tok said the country is \u201cexperiencing the worst day of its democracy.\u201d \u201cFor the first time in the 31 years of our democratic sovereign republic, someone has decided to express a political opinion not in an election but with a gun on the street,\u201d he wrote on Facebook. Slovaks have been deeply divided over the country\u2019s direction and position in the world since Fico\u2019s return to power last year. Supporters see Fico as a caring leader who has their interests at heart; critics say he is a populist whose pro-Russian leanings pose major risks for the country. The country has seen weeks of largely peaceful protests over his coalition government\u2019s controversial domestic reforms. The government is also trying to shut down public service broadcaster RTVS and plans to replace it with a new national broadcaster, which would be under tighter control of the government. Felt like a \u2018nightmare\u2019 Social media footage appeared to show the moment Fico was attacked. As he approaches a crowd of people, a man is seen lunging towards Fico with what appears to be a gun pointed at him.  Five shots are heard and Fico falls to the ground. An eyewitness who was at the scene where Fico was shot said the attack felt like a \u201cnightmare\u201d after hearing three \u201cquick\u201d shots, fired one after the other as if you were to \u201cthrow a firecracker on the ground.\u201d \u201cI heard three shots, it was quick one by one like if you throw a firecracker on the ground,\u201d eyewitness\u00a0Lubica Valkova told Reuters, adding that \u201che (Fico) fell next to the barrier.\u201d \u201cI think it is a nightmare, I\u2019ll tell you I think I will not wake up from this,\u201d the 66-year-old said. \u201cThat this is not possible to happen in\u00a0Slovakia.\u201d Valkova said she had been waiting a long time to shake Fico\u2019s hand and was taking pictures of him when he walked out of the building in Handlova. \u201cAt this moment we heard something like a bang, we thought someone made a joke and threw a firecracker on the ground, that was my first reaction,\u201d Valkova recalled. The Slovak resident told Reuters she had been waiting from 10 a.m. local time. She claimed police did not search people who were waiting at the event, adding that \u201cwe could have shown our empty hands.\u201d Ally of Moscow In what was a stunning comeback for the controversial politician, Fico won a third term as Slovakian prime minister last October after running a campaign that criticized western support for Ukraine. As prime minister, he made a major U-turn in Slovakia\u2019s foreign policy and its previously staunch support for Ukraine: Fico had pledged an immediate end to Slovak military support for Ukraine and promised to block Ukraine\u2019s NATO ambitions. Ahead of the election, Fico made no secret of his sympathies towards the Kremlin and blamed \u201cUkrainian Nazis and fascists\u201d for provoking Vladimir Putin into launching the invasion, repeating the\u00a0false narrative Russia\u2019s president\u00a0has used to justify his invasion. While in opposition, Fico became a close ally of Hungary\u2019s Prime Minister Viktor Orban, especially when it came to criticism of the European Union. Domestically, his coalition government is also pushing controversial reforms that have prompted weeks of large-scale peaceful protests. Attempts to overhaul the criminal justice system have been particularly controversial, as the government seeks to reduce penalties for corruption and has already abolished Slovakia\u2019s special prosecutor\u2019s office, which was tasked with investigating serious and politically sensitive corruption cases, including some that involved people connected to Fico and his party SMER (\u201cDirection \u2013 Social Democracy\u201d). Fico previously served as Slovakia\u2019s prime minister for more than a decade, first between 2006 and 2010 and then again from 2012 to 2018. He was forced to resign in March 2018 after weeks of mass protests over the murder of investigative journalist Jan Kuciak and his fianc\u00e9e, Martina Ku\u0161n\u00edrov\u00e1. Kuciak reported on corruption among the country\u2019s elite, including people directly connected to Fico and his party SMER. World leaders immediately condemned the attack. Russian President Vladimir Putin said in a telegram to Slovakia\u2019s president that \u201cthere can be no justification for this monstrous crime\u201d and wished Fico a speedy and complete recovery. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, tweeted: \u201cI strongly condemn the vile attack on Prime Minister Robert Fico. Such acts of violence have no place in our society and undermine democracy, our most precious common good.\u201d And Hungarian Prime Minister Orban added: \u201cI was deeply shocked by the heinous attack against my friend, Prime Minister Robert Fico. We pray for his health and quick recovery!\u201d Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky expressed \u201csolidarity with the people of Slovakia\u201d following the \u201cappalling\u201d assault on Fico. US President Joe Biden said he was \u201calarmed\u201d by the attempted assassination of Fico, calling it a \u201chorrific act of violence.\u201d \u201cJill and I are praying for a swift recovery, and our thoughts are with his family and the people of Slovakia,\u201d he said in a statement. United Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said he \u201cstrongly condemns the shocking attack.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments.

On Tuesday, England manager Gareth Southgate announced a 33-man squad which will be whittled down to 26 players for the continental tournament beginning on June 14 in Germany.

That\u00a0was a difficult call to make.\u201d United\u2019s rising star Kobbie Mainoo has been included in the squad alongside teammates Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw, despite the latter\u2019s lengthy injury layoff. England\u2019s all-time record goalscorer Harry Kane will have a formidable supporting cast in Real Madrid\u2019s Jude Bellingham, Manchester City\u2019s Phil Foden and Arsenal winger Bukayo Saka. Southgate has also called up a total of five uncapped players: Liverpool duo Curtis Jones and Jarell Quansah,\u00a0Crystal Palace\u2019s Adam Wharton, Everton\u2019s Jarrad Branthwaite and Burnley goalkeeper James Trafford.

{"id": "2024_05_15_europe_mohamed-amra-france-prison-attack-intl", "text": "A rare episode of violence disrupted the peaceful region of Normandy in northern France on Tuesday when gunmen ambushed a prison convoy to spring a notorious prison inmate known as \u201cThe Fly.\u201d The attack took place while prisoner Mohamed Amra, 30, was being transported from a court hearing in Rouen to a nearby prison in \u00c9vreux, and has led to a massive manhunt. The prison convoy was driving on a motorway when it came under heavy gunfire, resulting in the deaths of two prison guards, while three others were seriously injured. Here\u2019s what we know so far about the escaped inmate, as a search involving hundreds of police officers enters its second day. \u2018Well known\u2019 to authorities Mohamed Amra, nicknamed \u201cLa Mouche\u201d or \u201cThe Fly,\u201d is \u201cvery well known\u201d to the French justice system having sustained a total of 13 convictions, according to Paris state prosecutor Laure Beccuau. A judicial court in Marseilles is currently investigating Amra for a string of offenses including complicity in premeditated murder in an organized gang, complicity in kidnapping and the taking of hostages, according to Beccuau. CNN\u2019s affiliate in France, BFMTV, reports that the 30-year-old is a suspected narcotics boss. Amra\u2019s lawyer, Hugues Vivier, disputes this, saying there had been nothing to alert authorities to his client having a \u201cparticularly dangerous\u201d profile. Beccuau told journalists that Amra\u2019s criminal record does not contain any convictions for drug-related offenses. Most of his convictions relate to incidents of theft with aggravated offenses, Beccuau said, adding that he had been incarcerated in various facilities since January 2022. On May 10,\u00a0Amra\u00a0was found guilty on the charge of burglary by a court in \u00c9vreux, resulting in a prison sentence of 18 months. He is also under investigation in Marseille for a kidnap which led to a death, Beccuau said. As part of his statement last night, Beccuau said that Amra had been placed under security level three - meaning he was not a high-security prisoner. This is why only five officers were involved in escorting him from the court back to prison. Amra, who was born in the city of Rouen in northern France, was first convicted by authorities in October 2009 aged 15 years old, according to Beccuau. It is understood that Amra had attempted to escape from \u00c9vreux prison two days prior to the ambush. Speaking to BFMTV, Emmanuel Baudin, a union leader of prison guards, said: \u201cWe know that he tried to escape two or three days ago by sawing off the bars of his cell. So colleagues moved him to a disciplinary unit.\u201d In an interview on French radio, Amra\u2019s mother said she broke down crying when she heard about the deadly ambush. \u201cI broke down, I cried.\u00a0Really I wasn\u2019t well. How can lives be taken like that? It makes me sick \u2026\u00a0It\u2019s serious,\u201d she told France\u2019s RTL radio network. Manhunt underway A massive manhunt has been launched to find Amra and the gunmen who carried out the prison break. Interpol put out a red notice \u2013 a request for worldwide law enforcement officials to locate and provisionally arrest that person \u2013 for Amra. It is not, as Interpol points out, an international arrest warrant. Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said on X he has mobilized the national gendarmerie and \u201cseveral hundred\u201d police officers for the manhunt. French Justice Minister Eric Dupond-Moretti told reporters that the incident was the first time a French prison employee has died while working since 1992. French President Emmanuel Macron wrote on X that \u201cevery effort is being made to find the perpetrators of this crime so that justice can be done in the name of the French people.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/europe/mohamed-amra-france-prison-attack-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_18_asia_tsai-taiwan-map-china-intl-hnk-dst", "text": "Tsai Ing-wen never set out to be a leader. Growing up shy, she aspired to become an archeologist, because \u201cpeople that are dead already wouldn\u2019t jump up and argue with you.\u201d But instead of picking over the remains of history, the self-described introvert ended up charting a new course for Taiwan in some of the world\u2019s choppiest geopolitical waters. \u201cAt this very moment, Taiwan faces a difficult situation,\u201d Tsai said in her inauguration speech when she became the island\u2019s first female president in 2016.\u00a0She was handed a flatlining economy, a lagging military and a groundswell of discontent over her predecessor\u2019s push to forge closer ties with neighboring China, an authoritarian giant that has vowed to one day absorb the self-ruled democracy. Eight years on, as the 67-year-old prepares to step down after two terms in office, she leaves the island of 23 million people with an elevated international profile, a firmer partnership with the United States, ongoing defense reforms and a consolidated sense of its distinct Taiwanese identity. It is also left with the looming threat of invasion by China, which has grown more assertive and belligerent under strongman leader Xi Jinping. Xi has ramped up pressure on Taiwan and vowed to never renounce the use of force to bring it under control. While supporters applaud Tsai for standing up to China, defending Taiwan\u2019s sovereignty, freedom and democracy, critics blame her for straining ties with Beijing, stoking cross-strait tensions. Under Tsai, Taiwan, which has its own past of brutal authoritarian rule and repression of minorities, has championed LGBTQ rights and become a bastion of democracy and liberal values in Asia, offering a stark contrast to Xi\u2019s authoritarian, socially conservative and patriarchal vision for China. Domestically, there have been mounting public grievances over livelihood issues, especially Taiwan\u2019s stubbornly low wages and unaffordable housing. But according to multiple polls, Tsai is leaving office with a net-positive approval rating \u2013 unprecedented among Taiwan\u2019s outgoing leaders in the democratic era. On Monday, Tsai will hand the baton to her former premier and vice president Lai Ching-te, who will be sworn in as Taiwan\u2019s new president after winning the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) an unprecedented third term in January. Days before the election, Tsai summed up the island\u2019s transformation over the past eight years in her last New Year\u2019s address as president. \u201cWhat has changed is that Taiwan is no longer overlooked,\u201d she said. \u201cIf someone were to ask me what my legacy for Taiwan is, I would say that I am leaving behind a Taiwan of the world.\u201d An unconventional politician Tsai is an unconventional politician in Taiwan. Reserved by nature, she cut a quiet figure in a boisterous democracy known for its festival-like rallies and emotional political speeches. She never married or had children and is an animal lover whose beloved pets frequently featured on her social media accounts, something that endeared her to many young people. She used to be so shy that she would lower her head to avoid meeting people\u2019s eyes when walking down the street, Wellington Koo, her national security advisor, said in Taiwan in Transition, a documentary on Tsai\u2019s presidency. In another documentary, Invisible Nation, Tsai admitted she never dreamed of becoming a president and dreaded talking to people when she was young. \u201cI wanted a quiet life. I thought I would become a historian or an archeologist to study things that happened in the past, (because) people that are dead already wouldn\u2019t jump up and argue with you,\u201d she said. But she ended up studying law and becoming a professor, before working as a trade negotiator for Taiwan and a government minister responsible for China policy. Years working as a non-partisan technocrat imbued her with a \u201cmodest, quiet and calm\u201d style of leadership, according to Invisible Nation\u2019s director Vanessa Hope. Tsai entered politics at 48 years old, when she joined the ruling DPP in 2004. Four years later, the political latecomer faced little competition to become DPP\u2019s chairperson as the party reeled from a crushing presidential election defeat. She first ran for president in 2012, but lost to incumbent Ma Ying-jeou from the Kuomintang (KMT). She succeeded at the second try, making history not only as Taiwan\u2019s first woman president, but also one of the first women in Asia elected to top office without hailing from a political dynasty. \u201cPeople always think that I\u2019m a very cold person,\u201d Tsai said in Invisible Nation. \u201cBut the day I was elected president, that was the most emotional moment in my life.\u201d \u2018Put Taiwan on the map\u2019 Since Tsai took office, Taiwan has been caught in an intensifying battle for dominance between China and the US, a global pandemic and the geopolitical and economic fallouts from raging wars in Ukraine and Gaza. Through it all, the island has boosted its international standing and recognition, bolstering its role as a key democratic partner and an indispensable link in the global microchip supply chain. In 2019, Taiwan became the first Asian jurisdiction to legalize same-sex marriage. In the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic, it won international praise for its exemplary response and efforts to help other countries, despite its exclusion from the World Health Organization (WHO). Taipei has also enjoyed a surge of international backing from like-minded partners, including the US, Japan and the Czech Republic. \u201cShe\u2019ll be known as the one who put Taiwan on the map internationally,\u201d said Wen-ti Sung, a Taipei-based fellow with the Atlantic Council\u2019s Global China Hub. During China\u2019s rapid rise to become the world\u2019s second-largest economy and a major power, Taiwan had at times found itself something of an afterthought.\u00a0Now, the island\u2019s strategic importance \u2013 it is the world\u2019s largest producer of advanced semiconductors \u2013 has thrust it to the center of geopolitical calculations, with peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait becoming a matter of global concern. Amid hardening global fault lines, Tsai worked to strengthen ties with the US during both the Trump and Biden administrations. The two sides bolstered economic cooperation, reciprocated high-level political visits and expanded US arms sales to Taiwan. Support for Taiwan has become one of the few issues of bipartisan consensus ahead of the US presidential elections. \u201cWe have seen a normative shift in the way that Western governments talk about Taiwan, in ways that legitimize its sovereignty,\u201d said Amanda Hsiao, senior China analyst for the International Crisis Group. \u201cUS-China competition and Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine were also factors that accelerated this trend. But she took advantage of the geopolitical winds.\u201d Despite tightening ties with its most important security guarantor, the island\u00a0lost 10 diplomatic allies to Beijing during Tsai\u2019s tenure. It has also been excluded from the WHO\u2019s annual assembly since 2016, losing its previous observer status since Tsai took office. Standing up to China Poaching Taiwan\u2019s dwindling number of diplomatic allies and blocking it from attending the World Health Assembly as an observer is widely seen as part of Beijing\u2019s efforts to pressure Tsai into toeing its political line. Unlike the opposition KMT, Tsai and the DPP have refused to endorse the so-called \u201c1992 consensus\u201d that both Taiwan and the mainland belong to \u201cone China,\u201d but with different interpretations of what that means. Beijing, which deems the tacit agreement a precondition for dialogue, has cut official contact with Taipei since Tsai took office. In addition to the diplomatic squeeze, Xi has ramped up economic and military coercion, slapping tariffs on Taiwanese imports and routinely sending warplanes close to the island. Tensions came to a head in August 2022, when China fired missiles into waters around Taiwan and simulated a blockade with fighter jets and warships to show its displeasure with then US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s visit to Taipei. But Tsai also maintained a deliberately cautious stance, avoiding provoking Beijing with endorsement of Taiwan\u2019s formal independence, something many in her party openly favor and advocate for. Instead, she argued that Taiwan, officially known as the Republic of China, is already \u201can independent country\u201d and therefore has no need to declare independence. Analysts say Tsai moved the DPP\u2019s position on cross-strait relations closer to the center of politics in Taiwan, from a more fiercely pro-independence stance. Polls show growing numbers of Taiwanese \u2013 especially young people \u2013 view themselves as distinctly Taiwanese and have no desire to be part of China. Less than 10% now support an immediate or eventual unification, and only 3% identify primarily as Chinese \u2013 while 67% see themselves as primarily Taiwanese. But Huang Kwei-bo, professor of diplomacy at Taiwan\u2019s National Chengchi University, criticized Tsai\u2019s pivot toward the US at the expense of ties with China. \u201cTaiwan needs to work closely with the US\u2026but it would be unwise of Taiwan to lose political communication channels with Beijing,\u201d he said, noting\u00a0that Taiwan can\u2019t simply rely on deterrence or military operations to defend itself. \u201cMaintaining political relations with Beijing is another necessary approach to better security for Taiwan,\u201d he added. Defense reforms Weeks after Tsai was sworn in, she attended a graduation ceremony at Taiwan\u2019s Military Academy and delivered a stern message: \u201cOur armed forces need to be reformed in a big, bold way\u2026We also need to reform our national defense systems and culture.\u201d Since then, she has often shown up at military events, sometimes donning bulletproof vests and helmets among soldiers \u2013 challenging prejudices that question women\u2019s ability to command the military. Over her tenure, Tsai has boosted military spending, extended mandatory military service from four months to a year and accelerated the development of its indigenous weapons program to boost combat readiness, including the island\u2019s first domestically produced submarine. These developments \u201cgive confidence to Taiwan\u2019s security partners in terms of the island\u2019s determination for its own fair share for providing its own security,\u201d Sung said. Taipei has also been talking with Washington to establish a \u201ccontingency stockpile\u201d of munitions on Taiwanese soil. The US is bound by law to supply Taiwan with weapons to defend itself, and for decades the Taiwanese military has been purchasing fighter jets and missiles from Washington. But under Tsai, Taiwan has sought to enhance its asymmetric defense capabilities, developing and procuring cheaper and more mobile weapon systems that could be instrumental in halting a potential Chinese invasion. Taiwanese military experts have increasingly advocated for such an approach, noting that Taiwan can never match China in military might and assets. Despite the increases, Taiwan\u2019s defense budget is still dwarfed by that of China, accounting for less than 10% of Beijing\u2019s military spending. But Taiwan can still make itself an enormously costly place for China to try and overrun without having to match its far larger, wealthier neighbor. The war in Ukraine has shown Taiwan the effectiveness of portable missiles and drones on the battlefield in fending off a more powerful enemy, experts say. \u201cThe international environment shifted and that contributed to this awareness in Taiwan of how close war could be,\u201d Hsiao said. \u201cTsai opened the door to defense reform and the idea that defending Taiwan requires a whole-of-society effort.\u201d Domestic challenges Tsai has also left a mixed domestic legacy. Her push to legalize same-sex marriage angered conservatives, especially in rural regions, but made Taiwan the envy of LGBTQ communities across Asia. This week, days before stepping down as president, Tsai invited Taiwanese drag queen Nymphia Wind to perform the first ever drag show at the presidential office, following her win on hit TV series \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\u201d last month. Tsai has also sought to revitalize economic growth and address social inequality, nurturing emerging industries such as renewable energy and launching pension reforms. During her tenure, Taiwan\u2019s economy grew at an average rate of over 3%, but many residents say the economic benefits are little felt in their everyday lives. Instead, Tsai\u2019s administration has faced mounting discontent over stagnant wages, skyrocketing housing prices and cost of living. She has also been criticized for sluggish judicial reforms, failure to rein in online scams and a plan to phase out nuclear energy, as well as not going far enough in implementing transitional justice and promoting indigenous rights. \u201cUnder her reign, there has been a squeeze on airtime for more local and bread-and-butter issues,\u201d said Sung. \u201cAnd you see this reflected in the election results as well.\u201d Tsai\u2019s DPP suffered huge losses in two mid-term elections, where local issues normally trump national security as voters\u2019 primary concern. Near the end of her first term, Tsai\u2019s approval ratings plummeted and her chance for a second term was looking increasingly uncertain \u2013 until pro-democracy protests erupted in Hong Kong in 2019 against Beijing\u2019s tightening grip. She campaigned heavily on promises to not allow Taiwan to become another Hong Kong, and received a landslide victory. In January\u2019s presidential elections, public grievances over livelihood issues became a focal point of criticism against the DPP, splitting votes \u2013 especially from young people \u2013 to a third-party candidate who promised a more \u201cscientific and pragmatic\u201d approach in addressing those issues. The DPP also lost its majority in the national legislature, leaving more potential political gridlock for the incoming Lai administration to push through policies and legislation. As Tsai hands the baton to Lai, analysts say it might still be too early to draw conclusions on her legacy. \u201cHow we ultimately judge her legacy will depend on what happens in the next administration as well, as in what they do with what Tsai has achieved,\u201d Hsiao said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/18/asia/tsai-taiwan-map-china-intl-hnk-dst/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_05_21_europe_ukrainian-drone-unit-russia-intl-latam", "text": "Dusk brings an urgent race to hide before dark. The \u201cCode 9.2\u201d drone unit, from the 92nd assault brigade, are moving into a new launch position from where they\u00a0are about to\u00a0conduct a rare and\u00a0potent\u00a0mission: flying drones into Russia and dropping mines onto key roads inside enemy territory. Twilight provides a moment of opportunity to set up new equipment and unload their Humvee before dark makes these complex tasks impossible. They can only hope the grey, fading light shields them from the endless stream of Russian drones that fly overhead, looking for something to strike. A Starlink dish, a longer range drone antenna, dozens of battery packs, and two huge \u201cVampire\u201d quadcopters\u00a0are\u00a0dumped into trenches and bunkers, set up, and in use within 30 minutes. It is only when the dark has set in that their work can begin. And immediately the threat is apparent. Before operators Andrey and Artem can leave the bunker to begin work, a noise sends them rushing back in for cover. \u201cSssshhh,\u201d Andrey hisses. \u201cOrlan.\u201d The only way to protect yourself from being seen by an Orlan \u2013 a spotter drone that can also have thermal cameras enabling it to see in the dark \u2013 is to hide. And to silently listen for it to pass. \u201cThey will be flying all night,\u201d he says. The horizon is peppered with flashes \u2013 distant explosions.\u00a0Across its center twinkles the Russian city of Belgorod, now repeatedly hit by Ukrainian strikes. Russian President Vladimir Putin has claimed his week-old offensive into Kharkiv region in Ukraine is partially aimed at creating a buffer zone along the border to protect a population whose safety was never in doubt when he launched his invasion in February 2022. The bunker is quickly turned into an operations hub, the team finding it hard to adjust to the silent open fields of their new home, after months of fierce battles around Bakhmut. In the silence, Artem says, \u201cyou don\u2019t know, will you get hit or not.\u201d He points out the difference with Ukraine\u2019s failed defense last year of Bakhmut, in the eastern Donetsk region \u2013 and their work tonight, about\u00a0four miles from the border. Here\u00a0the heavy foliage, lack of fixed front lines and proximity to Russia means \u201creconnaissance groups enter and can get anywhere.\u201d They joke they could wake up to a Russian soldier standing over them. For Artem though this fight is intensely personal. His parents still live in a partially destroyed village a short drive away. For 18 months he deceived them\u00a0by saying\u00a0he was stationed at a peaceful checkpoint, when he was really fighting on the front lines. Now they know he is nearby, and the feeling of fighting for his actual home leaves him feeling unsettled. \u201cAnxiety,\u201d he says of the main feeling. \u201cMy parents are right here so if, God forbid, we fail somehow, if there is a breakthrough\u2026 it\u2019s a big responsibility.\u201d Dark has set in, punctured only by the flashes of artillery strikes and the near-full moon. The team move to work fast. Artem and Andrey race to attach the mines to the drone, using only red lights. Suddenly, a tiny whining noise is audible. \u201cRun,\u201d says Andrey, and they take cover in a nearby bunker. Spotted once, the trenches could become a target for airstrikes and artillery all night, and there is little chance to escape: they have no vehicle and racing across open ground on foot is perilous too. A few minutes pass. Flares illuminate an adjacent field. Battles are raging elsewhere too. The team resumes work. Zip ties prime fuses. Masking tape readies explosive. Then again, another drone passes close by, and they race again for shelter. Interrupted twice, and a little breathless from racing\u00a0for\u00a0cover, the team are finally ready to launch. Back in the bunker, the pilot Sasha can see fields flow below the Vampire on its night vision camera. He points out the border line, and then adds: \u201cNow, we are already in Russia\u201d. \u201cDid you bring your passport?\u201d quips Artem. \u201cI can go without a visa,\u201d replies Sasha. Being funny used to be the third team member\u2019s job, before the war dragged Ukrainians of disparate professions into trenches. Andrey was a comic, and briefly worked with Volodymyr Zelensky \u2013 long before his days as a politician and Ukrainian president when he was a TV producer and actor \u2013 on his comedy show. \u201cHonestly, he had one of the best vibes among the people I met,\u201d he says. \u201cThe strongest energy. It is always interesting with him. We spent a lot of time together, one on one.\u201d It is a peculiar trait of the Ukrainian force, compared to their enemy: it is unlikely any of Putin\u2019s troops spent time on stage with the Kremlin head cracking jokes before the war. The drone flies deeper into Russia, and then warning messages ring out loudly in the bunker, on grating repeat, signalling that GPS jammers are at work. Sasha is briefly concerned they may lose the drone. The livestream cuts. He thumbs the controls agitatedly. But then minutes later, the signal is restored: the drone has flown through the interference, kept on course, and can now continue towards the target. Moments later, two packages drop from its underbelly. The mines sit on the road, and later the next day, the unit says, hit one armored car and a soft skin vehicle. As the drone approaches, the team have two problems. Firstly, its GPS system appears damaged and it crashes unceremoniously into the field, upside down. Secondly, they think they can see an Russian Orlan that appears to have followed the drone back into Ukraine, perhaps seeking their launch position. The team stay in shelter a few minutes, hoping the threat passes. Shells whistle overhead and crash into nearby fields. They retrieve the drone, but must rely on their spare until dawn, when daylight will give them a chance to assess the damage. The sorties continue, the team saying they hold the record for the most Vampire flights in one night of 24. But their target now is Russia itself, a powerful symbol of Kyiv\u2019s decision to take the fight back to Moscow, and the new, dangerous escalatory turns this conflict is taking in its third year.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/europe/ukrainian-drone-unit-russia-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_europe_slovakia-prime-minister-fico-out-of-danger-intl-hnk", "text": "Slovakian police have charged a man, described as a politically motivated \u201clone wolf,\u201d\u00a0with the attempted murder\u00a0of Prime Minister Robert Fico, who is seriously ill in hospital after\u00a0an assassination attempt that shocked the eastern European nation. Fico was conscious and able to speak on Thursday afternoon, according to his long-time ally and the Slovakian President-elect Peter Pellegrini who visited him in the hospital. He said the prime minister was still in serious condition after being\u00a0shot five times from a close range and undergoing surgery. The assassination attempt rocked the central\u00a0European country and sparked global condemnation. Slovakia\u2019s Interior Minister Mat\u00fa\u0161 \u0160utaj E\u0161tok said the suspect told law enforcement officers that his action was motivated by his disagreement with the government and its reforms. The 59-year-old populist leader, who returned to power last year and whose controversial policy changes have sparked protests in recent weeks, was attacked on Wednesday after an off-site government meeting in the town of Handlova. \u0160utaj E\u0161tok said the police was pursuing only one investigative theory \u2013 that the attack was politically motivated. He said that the suspect told law enforcement officers that he disagreed with Fico\u2019s policies and that he decided to act after the recent presidential election, which saw a Fico ally \u2013 Pellegrini \u2013 emerge as the winner. \u201cThe reasons (the suspect gave) were the decision to abolish the special prosecutor\u2019s office, the decision to stop supplying military assistance to Ukraine, the reform of public service broadcaster and the dismissal of the judicial council head,\u201d \u0160utaj E\u0161tok said. He said the suspect is not a member of any extremist group, calling him \u201ca lone wolf\u201d who had in the past attended anti-government protests. The alleged shooter has been identified by multiple local media outlets. Asked whether the 71-year-old described in some media as Juraj C. from Levice, a town in southwest Slovakia, is the suspect, the spokesperson for the prosecutor\u2019s office, Zuzana Drobov\u00e1, told CNN on Thursday: \u201cI can confirm this is the person who has been charged.\u201d Slovakian media reported the shooter was a writer and a poet. The Slovak Writers\u2019 Association said Wednesday that the name identified in the local media was a member of the group. The prime minister had approached a small crowd of people waiting to meet him, when the suspected gunman in the crowd lunged forward and shot him five times from across a security barrier. Footage from the scene showed the injured prime minister being bundled into a vehicle by his staff, before it speeds away with him inside. Nobody else was injured in the attack. The alleged shooter has been identified by multiple local media outlets as a 71-year-old man from southern Slovakia. There has been no official confirmation of the identity of the shooter, but his face was clearly visible in some of the video footage of the attack and his subsequent arrest. Slovakian media reported the shooter was a writer and a poet. The Slovak Writers\u2019 Association said Wednesday that the name identified in the local media was a member of the group. Dramatic footage from the scene of the attack shows the gunman approaching Fico and firing at him from close range across a security barrier. The injured prime minister is then seen being bundled into a vehicle by his staff, before it speeds away with him inside. Fico was first rushed into a local hospital and then airlifted to a major trauma center in the nearby city of Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica, where he spent more than five hours in surgery, according to hospital officials. Officials said he was shot, among other places, in his stomach. Hospital director Miriam Lapun\u00edkov\u00e1 is said Thursday Fico was \u201cstabilized but in a very serious condition\u201d and that he would remain in the hospital\u2019s intensive care unit. She added that the hospital had two surgical teams operating on the prime minister. On Thursday morning, the country\u2019s Defense Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Robert Kali\u0148\u00e1k said Fico\u2019s condition \u201chas been stabilized overnight, more steps are being taken to better his health. The situation is really serious.\u201d The assassination attempt sent shockwaves across the country. Kali\u0148\u00e1k and \u0160utaj E\u0161tok delivered an emotional news conference outside the hospital on Wednesday night, saying the leader was \u201cfighting for his life.\u201d Visibly shaken and sometimes struggling for words, the two ministers appeared in deep shock over the attack. Later in the news conference, both men struck a more combative tone, blaming the attack on the \u201chatred\u201d being spread by \u201csome people\u201d and the media. Divisive figure in divided country Fico is the most powerful lawmaker in Slovakia. Unlike the president, whose role is more ceremonial and has limited scope, the prime minister holds rank as the decision-making head of government. Slovaks have been deeply divided over the country\u2019s direction and position in the world since Fico\u2019s return to power last year. Supporters see Fico as a caring leader who has their interests at heart; critics say he is a populist whose pro-Russian leanings pose major risks for the country. Slovakia\u2019s defense and interior ministers blamed rising hate speech and division for the political atmosphere in the country, which they said led to the assassination attempt. As prime minister,\u00a0Fico made a major U-turn in Slovakia\u2019s foreign policy and its previously staunch support for Ukraine, pledging to end the country\u2019s military support for Kyiv and promising to block Ukraine\u2019s NATO ambitions. The government is also trying to shut down the public service broadcaster and replace it with a new national broadcaster that would be under tighter state control. The reforms have been extremely divisive and have led to months of largely peaceful protests. Fico previously served as Slovakia\u2019s prime minister for more than a decade, first between 2006 and 2010 and then again from 2012 to 2018.

{"id": "2024_05_20_middleeast_icc-israel-hamas-arrest-warrant-war-crimes-intl", "text": "The International Criminal Court is seeking arrest warrants for Hamas leader in Gaza Yahya Sinwar and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity over the October 7 attacks on Israel and the subsequent war in Gaza, the court\u2019s prosecutor Karim Khan told CNN\u2019s Christiane Amanpour in an exclusive interview on Monday. Khan said the ICC\u2019s prosecution team is also seeking warrants for Israel\u2019s Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as two other top Hamas leaders \u2014 Mohammed Diab Ibrahim al-Masri, the leader of the Al Qassem Brigades\u00a0who is\u00a0better known as Mohammed Deif, and Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas\u2019 political leader. The move against the Israeli politicians mark the first time the ICC has targeted the top leader of a close ally of the United States. The decision puts Netanyahu in the company of the Russian President Vladimir Putin, for whom the ICC issued an arrest warrant over Moscow\u2019s war\u00a0on\u00a0Ukraine, and the Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi, who was facing an arrest warrant from the ICC for alleged crimes against humanity at the time of his capture and killing in October 2011. By applying for the arrest warrants against Israeli and Hamas leaders in the same action, Khan\u2019s office risks attracting criticism that it places a terror organization and an elected government on an equivalent footing. A panel of ICC judges will now consider Khan\u2019s application for the arrest warrants. Khan said the charges against Sinwar, Haniyeh and al-Masri include \u201cextermination, murder, taking of hostages, rape and sexual assault in detention.\u201d \u201cThe world was shocked on the 7th of October when people were ripped from their bedrooms, from their homes, from the different kibbutzim in Israel,\u201d Khan told Amanpour, adding that \u201cpeople have suffered enormously.\u201d Hamas-led militants killed around 1,200 people across several locations in southern Israel on October 7 and took some 250 hostages into Gaza. Many of the hostages are still being held in Gaza \u2013 Khan told Amanpour this meant crimes continued to be committed against \u201cso many innocent Israelis \u2026 that are held hostage by Hamas and families that are waiting for their return.\u201d Khan told Amanpour his team has a \u201cvariety of evidence\u201d to support the application for arrest warrants against Sinwar, Haniyeh and al-Masri, including authenticated video footage and photographs from the attacks as well as evidence from eyewitnesses and survivors. Khan said Israel had \u201cevery right and indeed an obligation to get hostages back, but you must do so by complying with the law.\u201d Responding to the announcement by Khan, Hamas said in a statement that it \u201cstrongly condemns the attempts of the ICC Prosecutor to equate victims with aggressors by issuing arrest warrants against a number of Palestinian resistance leaders without legal basis.\u201d \u201cHamas\u00a0calls on the ICC Prosecutor to issue arrest warrants against all war criminals among the occupation leaders, officers, and soldiers who participated in crimes against the Palestinian people, and demands the cancellation of all arrest warrants issued against Palestinian resistance leaders,\u201d the group added. \u2018Nobody is above the law\u2019 The charges against Netanyahu and Gallant include \u201ccausing extermination, causing starvation as a method of war, including the denial of humanitarian relief supplies, deliberately targeting civilians in conflict,\u201d Khan told Amanpour. \u201cThe fact that Hamas fighters need water doesn\u2019t justify denying water from all the civilian population of Gaza,\u201d he added. More than 35,500 Palestinians have been killed and more than 79,000 wounded in Gaza since October 7, the Ministry of Health in Gaza said on Monday. CNN cannot independently verify the figures. Netanyahu called the decision \u201ca political outrage.\u201d \u201cThey will not deter us and we will continue in the war until the hostages are released and Hamas is destroyed,\u201d he said at a meeting of the parliamentary group of his Likud party. Other Israeli officials echoed his sentiments. Benny Gantz, a member Israel\u2019s war cabinet, criticized Khan\u2019s decision immediately after it was announced, saying that Israel was fighting \u201cwith one of the strictest moral codes in history, while complying with international law and boasting a robust independent judiciary.\u201d \u201cDrawing parallels between the leaders of a democratic country determined to defend itself from despicable terror to leaders of a blood-thirsty terror organisation is a deep distortion of justice and blatant moral bankruptcy,\u201d he said, adding that the decision by the prosecutors \u201cis in itself a crime of historic proportion to be remembered for generation.\u201d The leader of the opposition, Yair Lapid, said the application for the arrest warrents was \u201ca complete moral failure.\u201d \u201cWe cannot accept the outrageous comparison between Netanyahu and Sinwar \u2026 We will not remain silent,\u201d he said.  Israel\u2019s President Isaac Herzog called it \u201cbeyond outrageous.\u201d When reports surfaced last month that the ICC chief prosecutor was considering this course of action,\u00a0Netanyahu said\u00a0that any ICC arrest warrants against senior Israeli government and military officials \u201cwould be an outrage of historic proportions,\u201d and that Israel \u201chas an independent legal system that rigorously investigates all violations of the law.\u201d Asked by Amanpour about the comments made by Netanyahu, Khan said: \u201cNobody is above the law.\u201d He said that if Israel disagrees with the ICC, \u201cthey are free, notwithstanding their objections to jurisdiction, to raise a challenge before the judges of the court and that\u2019s what I advise them to do.\u201d Israel and the United States are not members of the ICC. However, the ICC claims to have jurisdiction over Gaza, East Jerusalem and the West Bank after Palestinian leaders formally agreed to be bound by the court\u2019s founding principles in 2015. The ICC announcement on Monday is separate from the case that is currently being heard by the the International Court of Justice\u00a0(ICJ) over an\u00a0accusation from South Africa\u00a0that Israel was committing genocide in its war against Hamas following the October 7 attacks. While the ICJ considers cases that involve countries and nations, and the ICC is a\u00a0criminal\u00a0court, which brings cases against individuals for war crimes or crimes against humanity. Monday\u2019s announcement is not the first time that the ICC acted in relation to Israel. In March 2021, Khan\u2019s office launched an investigation into possible crimes committed in the Palestinian territories since June 2014 in Gaza and the West Bank. Located in The Hague, Netherlands, and created by a treaty called the Rome Statute first brought before the United Nations, the ICC operates independently. Most countries \u2013 124 of them \u2013 are parties to the treaty, but there are notable exceptions, including Israel, the US and Russia. That means that if the court grants Khan\u2019s application and issues arrest warrants for the five men, any country that is a member would have to arrest them and extradite them to The Hague. Under the rules of the court, all signatories of the Rome Statute have the obligation to cooperate fully with its decisions. This would make it extremely difficult for Netanyahu and Gallant to travel internationally, including to many countries that are among Israel\u2019s closest allies \u2013 including Germany and the United Kingdom. Sinwar, Haniyeh and al-Masri have been officially designated as global terrorists by the US, meaning they are under travel bans, asset freezes and sanctions. The US, the UK, Japan, Canada as well as the European Union and others have designated Hamas as a terror group and imposed sanctions on its leaders.

The attempted coup, which targeted the residence of Congolese politician Vital Kamerhe and the country\u2019s presidential\u00a0palace,\u00a0was led\u00a0by opposition leader Christian Malanga, who was killed\u00a0in a gun battle between the armed putschists and the presidential guards, according to army spokesman General Sylvain Ekenge.

Miller said privacy laws prevented him from confirming whether or not the US had reached out to the Congolese government to be granted consular access to the two individuals. Videos widely shared on social media, but not verified by CNN, showed a man with a bloody face\u00a0being surrounded\u00a0by Congolese military personnel. US\u00a0ambassador to the DRC, Lucy Tamlyn, said in a post on social media platform X, that she was \u201cshocked\u201d by reports of the attempted coup, adding that her country \u201cwill cooperate with the DRC authorities to the fullest extent as they investigate these criminal acts and hold accountable any\u00a0US\u00a0citizen involved in criminal acts.\u201d It is not immediately known whether President Felix Tshisekedi, who secured re-election for a second term after last December\u2019s disputed\u00a0vote\u00a0was at the presidential palace during the attack.

{"id": "2024_05_20_uk_julian-assange-wikileaks-extradition-hearing-uk-intl-gbr", "text": "London\u2019s High Court has ruled that Julian Assange has the right to appeal in his final challenge against extradition to the United States. The legal victory for the WikiLeaks founder was cheered by dozens of his supporters as they rallied outside the court in the British capital. Some beat drums, some shouted \u201cdrop the case,\u201d while other supporters held placards reading \u201cLet him go Joe,\u201d in reference to US President Joe Biden. Assange\u2019s legal team argued in Monday\u2019s hearing that the judges, Victoria Sharp and Jeremy Johnson, should not accept the assurances given by US prosecutors that he could seek to rely on the rights and protections under the US First Amendment. His team made the case that, if extradited, Assange could be discriminated against on the basis of his nationality, as an Australian-born foreign national. In a short ruling, the judges said the US submissions were not sufficient, granting Assange permission to a full appeal in relation to the legal points on freedom of speech and nationality. A date has not yet been set for the next hearing. The 52-year-old is wanted by US authorities on\u00a0espionage charges connected to his organization\u2019s publication of thousands of classified documents and diplomatic cables in 2010 and 2011. Assange faces spending the rest of his life behind bars if convicted. Stella Assange, Julian\u2019s wife, said outside the court that Monday\u2019s ruling \u201cmarks a turning point.\u201d \u201cEveryone can see what is going on here: the US case is offensive, it offends our democratic principles. It offends our right to know it is an attack on journalists everywhere,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe are relieved as a family that the courts took the right decision today. But how long can this go on for?\u201d Activist Redde Jean-Baptiste told CNN that one of Assange\u2019s lawyers had said the WikiLeaks founder had been having sleepless nights. \u201c(He\u2019s) trying to prepare for a case that would determine his life or his death, so as you can imagine the pressure he\u2019s been under that is torture in itself,\u201d Jean-Baptiste said. Jean-Baptiste added that Monday\u2019s ruling is a \u201cglimpse of hope for him\u201d and \u201cwe are now on the right path.\u201d In March, the London court delayed its decision on an extradition as the judges sought a series of assurances, around both the First Amendment protections and the death penalty. The United States will not seek a\u00a0death\u00a0penalty if Assange is extradited, the High Court was told on Monday. \u201cThe United States assures that he will not be tried for a death-eligible offence,\u201d according to documents submitted by lawyers representing the US government. It has been 12 years since the Australian has lived freely. Assange has spent the past five years in London\u2019s high-security Belmarsh prison and nearly seven years before that holed up at the Ecuadorian embassy in the city\u00a0trying to avoid arrest. He maintains his extradition is politically motivated. Alan Rusbridger, editor of the UK political monthly Prospect Magazine, wrote in an op-ed for CNN that working with Assange was \u201coften a bumpy ride\u201d but that their collaboration while he was still the Guardian\u2019s editor-in-chief was \u201cgroundbreaking.\u201d He added that the US case looks \u201clike a very belated attempt to punish whistleblowers and discourage journalists, whether conventional or not, from poking their noses where they\u2019re not welcome.\u201d This story has been updated.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/uk/julian-assange-wikileaks-extradition-hearing-uk-intl-gbr/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "world"}}

Comprising of 391 units, Aston Martin Residences Miami sits at the mouth of the Miami River on Biscayne Bay, the firm said in a statement Tuesday. Designed in partnership with architect Rodolfo Miani of Bodas Mian Anger and built by G&G Business Developments, the 249-meter- (818-foot-) tall building houses seven penthouses, each with private pools and terraces, as well as apartments ranging in size from one to five bedrooms. The largest unit is the \u201cUnique Triplex Penthouse,\u201d arranged over three floors at the top of the building, which remains on the market for $59 million. The property was officially opened on Tuesday. Timed to coincide with the Formula One Miami Grand Prix, the company said in a statement that it marks \u201cthe latest distinct expression of Aston Martin\u2019s ultra-luxury high performance brand.\u201d Featuring an infinity pool with a pool deck, jacuzzis and cabanas on the 55th floor, the sail-shaped complex has a two-floor fitness center, two movie theaters and a virtual golf simulator. The building has a sky bar and lounge, chef\u2019s kitchen, ballroom and private dining areas, as well as a spa, beauty salon and barber shop. Direct access to the sea via a superyacht marina is also available, plus a private butler service. Germ\u00e1n Coto, chief executive officer of G&G Business Developments, told CNN Tuesday that the firm wanted to work on a project in the \u201ccosmopolitan city\u201d of Miami, and that this piece of land was the perfect choice. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing plot with an excellent view of the river,\u201d said Coto. The structure\u2019s aerodynamic shape helps the building deal with the technical challenges presented by high winds in the area, as well as evoking the sleek shape of an Aston Martin, according to Marek Reichman, executive vice president and chief creative officer of Aston Martin. It also becomes wider from the base to the mid-section before tightening once more towards the top, making it appear to bow out over people on street level, Reichman told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the drama,\u201d he added. Challenges However, the process wasn\u2019t all plain sailing. \u201cIt was difficult to achieve what we wanted because the space and the plot is kind of small,\u201d said Coto, with the building fitting into a 1.25-acre plot of land. Meanwhile, local building regulations imposed strict standards, explained Reichman, taking into account the low-lying land and propensity for flooding. \u201cThey were some of the most amazing challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to withstand the flooding with the windows that are on street level.\u201d There were further obstacles due to the curved shape of the building, which means that units on the east side have an individual architectural structural component. Aston Martin touches Homeowners are able to customize their interior space with the help of the Aston Martin design team, with three style packages \u2013 Timeless, Covert and Indulgent \u2013 drawing on the company\u2019s British heritage, as well as the building\u2019s context. \u201cIt needs to have part of the DNA of an Aston Martin,\u201d Reichman said. \u201cBut we are in Miami, you don\u2019t have a cold November evening where you need to put the log fire on, so you\u2019ve got to be considerate of the environment that you\u2019re in.\u201d Design elements running through the building include doors with bespoke Aston Martin handles, number plinths and kestrel tan leather door tabs. Aston Martin said that 99% of the properties sold before the building was completed. Residences were sold for $1.5 million to $8.5 million, while penthouses ranged from $16 million to $59 million. The Unique Triplex Penthouse, on the market for $59 million, comes with the last remaining Aston Martin Vulcan, an 820 brake horsepower all-carbon fiber supercar, of which only 24 exist, a spokesman for the company said. Meanwhile, buyers of the 47 Signature and Penthouse units were also able to choose between an Aston Martin DBX sports SUV or the company\u2019s DB11 sportscar. Aston Martin isn\u2019t the first luxury carmaker to enter the residential property market. A 63-story building from Bentley will open in 2026 along the coastline of Sunny Isles Beach, Florida.

{"id": "2024_05_21_world_singapore-airlines-turbulence-bangkok", "text": "One person has died and at least 71 others were injured on board a Singapore Airlines plane that encountered severe turbulence on a flight from London to Singapore. The Boeing\u00a0777-300ER plane diverted to Bangkok, according to a post on the Singapore Airlines Facebook page. It said 211 passengers and 18 crew were on board. The company said initially in a post that 30 passengers had been hurt in the mid-air disruption and were being treated in hospitals, while other travelers were receiving outpatient care at the airport. The one person who died was a 73-year-old British man, identified as Geoff Kitchen. \u201cPreliminary investigations indicate that the deceased suffered from a heart condition,\u201d the General Manager of Bangkok\u2019s Suvarnabhumi International Airport Kittipong Kittikachorn said Tuesday, adding that the autopsy process was still ongoing. Kitchen\u2019s death was confirmed by the Thornbury Musical Theatre Group (TMTG), an establishment where he worked for over 35 years, in a Facebook post that described him as \u201calways a gentleman with the utmost honesty and integrity\u201d and who \u201calways did what was right for the group.\u201d The British Foreign Office told CNN it was supporting the family of a British passenger who died on a Singapore Airlines flight. The flight landed in the Thai capital at 3:45 p.m. local time (4:45 a.m. ET) Tuesday. Kittikachorn, who inspected the aircraft, told CNN he was informed of the emergency landing 10 minutes before it touched down. He also said that several passengers had sustained broken arms but that the majority of injuries were cuts and bruises. Some injured passengers were sent to the nearby Samitivej Srinakarin Hospital, Kittikachorn said, adding that almost 200 travelers were waiting to take onward flights to their destinations. A Singapore Airlines plane carrying 131 of the 211 passengers later departed Bangkok for Singapore, he said. The hospital said in an update that at least 71 people had been injured, including citizens from Malaysia, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Spain, the United States and Ireland. It also said six people are severely injured. Earlier,\u00a0Kittikachorn had said seven people were critically injured. Flight likely encountered rapidly developing thunderstorms The aviation tracking site FlightRadar24 says, based on its data, that the turbulence on Singapore Airlines flight SQ321 occurred over Myanmar at approximately 7:49 a.m. UTC (3:49 a.m. ET). This lines up with\u00a0a statement from the airline\u00a0stating that the plane, \u201cencountered sudden extreme turbulence over the Irrawaddy Basin [a river in Myanmar] at 37,000 feet, about 10 hours after departure.\u201d FlightRadar24 said in\u00a0a blog post\u00a0that, according to its data, at that time, \u201dthe flight encountered a rapid change in vertical rate, consistent with a sudden turbulence event.\u201d The data show the flight changing course about 14 minutes later. The airline says, \u201cThe pilot declared a medical emergency and diverted the aircraft to Bangkok.\u201d The FlightRadar24 data show the flight, which was cruising at 37,000 feet, suddenly dipping then rapidly climbing a few hundred feet before dipping and climbing again and then finally settling back at its cruising altitude. The entire disruption took about 90 seconds, according to the data, but resulted in dozens of injuries, including a fatality. The flight likely encountered rapidly developing thunderstorms over southern Myanmar on Tuesday during the time that extreme turbulence was reported, according to CNN\u00a0Weather\u00a0analysis. The analysis of satellite data shows an area of developing thunderstorms over the Irrawaddy Delta between 7 a.m. and 8:30 a.m. GMT (early afternoon local time). This corresponds to the same time and location reported by the airline and independent data analysis of the flight track from FlightRadar24. Tropical\u00a0thunderstorms like these are typical for this time of year with moisture increasing in the region as the southwest monsoon season is beginning in South Asia. They can form quickly in the early afternoon as the land heats up, especially near the coastline. Budding thunderstorms like Tuesday\u2019s may not appear on radar in their earliest stages, even though the quick rising motion within them can still produce turbulence. The storm cells likely grew from 20,000-30,000 feet to well over 50,000 feet in less than an hour. Investigations underway Singapore President Tharman Shanmugaratnam issued a statement on his social media accounts, expressing \u201ccondolences to the family and loved ones of the deceased.\u201d \u201cWe do not have the details of those affected, but know that the government ministries and agencies, as well as SIA, are doing their utmost to support all those affected and working with the authorities in Bangkok, where the plane had been diverted to,\u201d Shanmugaratnam said. Singapore\u2019s Minister for Transport Chee Hong Tat\u00a0said he was \u201cdeeply saddened to learn about the incident,\u201d in a statement posted to his social media. \u201cMinistry of Transport, Singapore, Singapore Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore and Changi Airport officials as well as SIA [Singapore Airlines] staff are providing support to the affected passengers and their families,\u201d he\u00a0said. Singapore\u2019s Ministry of Transport said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0that it was investigating the situation involving SQ321 and its Transport Safety Investigation Bureau was in touch with their Thai counterparts. Turbulence occurs when a plane flies through clashing bodies of air moving at widely different speeds. With light and moderate turbulence passengers might feel a strain against their seatbelt, and unsecured items could move around the cabin. But in severe cases turbulence can throw passengers around the cabin, causing severe injuries and occasionally death. In March 2023,\u00a0violent movements\u00a0on a private jet\u00a0resulted in the death of a former White House official, though an investigation later found that weather was not involved in that incident.\u00a0That incident came just days\u00a0after seven people were transported to hospitals after a\u00a0separate commercial flight\u00a0hit significant turbulence. In July 2023, seven people were injured on a Hawaiian Airlines flight to Sydney, Australia, when the plane was buffeted by severe turbulence, and 36 people\u00a0were injured on a Hawaiian Airlines flight from Arizona to Honolulu in December 2022, with 20 people taken to emergency rooms. A September 2022 study predicts that clear-air turbulence will increase significantly around the globe by the period 2050-2080, in particular along the busiest flight routes, and the strongest type of turbulence will increase the most. Singapore Airlines is often considered one of the world\u2019s safest carriers. Its only previous fatal accident was in October 2000 when flight SQ006 crashed when the Boeing 747-400 took off from a closed runway in Taiwan amid heavy rain, killing 83 on board. Singapore Airlines said later Tuesday that a dedicated team had arrived in Bangkok \u201cto support our colleagues and the local authorities on the ground\u201d in an update on its Facebook page. The flight operator expressed its \u201cdeepest condolences to the family of the deceased. We deeply apologize for the traumatic experience that our passengers and crew members suffered on this flight.\u201d Boeing has said it is in touch with the Singaporean carrier and is \u201cready to support them.\u201d The manufacturer is deferring further questions to the airline and local authorities.

{"id": "2024_05_17_africa_tiwa-savage-water-and-garri-nigeria-spc", "text": "Despite her extraordinary success in Afrobeats music, Tiwa Savage has long harbored a secret aspiration: to pursue a career in acting. \u201cActing, I would say, was my first love before music,\u201d she told CNN\u2019s Larry Madowo during a recent interview in Lagos. At 44, the multifaceted, award-winning Nigerian artist has transformed her dreams into reality. On May 10, her much-anticipated debut film, \u201cWater & Garri,\u201d hit Prime Video, marking her leap into acting. Executive produced by Savage and directed by her long-time music video director Meji Alabi, \u201cWater & Garri\u201d is a collaboration between Everything Savage, Unbound Studios, and JM Films. The concept was born from Savage\u2019s idea to create a visual album for her 2021 EP of the same name. Because of that, it \u201cinitially it was only supposed to be like a short film,\u201d Savage said, \u201cand then it grew on its own and took its own identity.\u201d Written by Comfort Emmanuel, the film is set in a fictional town on the Cape Coast of Ghana and follows a determined fashion designer named Aisha (Savage) who returns to her hometown due to a family tragedy after a decade in the US. However, upon her return home, she finds her once familiar surroundings altered by escalating violence and heightened tensions. As she reconnects with her family, old friends, and a former flame, Aisha must confront her past and face the guilt of what she left behind \u2013 an experience Savage says drew parallels to her own life. \u201cWe both felt like we had to go somewhere to chase our dreams,\u201d said Savage, who spent two weeks in intensive training in London to prepare for the role of Aisha. \u201cIt was just to break me out of my shell, to break me out of Tiwa Savage and just empty me out \u2013 and then just allow me to be or embody like a whole different character,\u201d she added. Experimenting with a new sound As the production of the film pressed forward, Savage didn\u2019t only shed her superstar persona, she moved on from the initial musical inspiration for the film, instead opting to create an original soundtrack for the movie. \u201cIt was supposed to include the first five songs on the EP; by the time we finished filming, it just took on a whole different identity, and we just created a whole new soundtrack,\u201d the singer explained. The album served as a platform for Savage to push her vocal boundaries and delve into new musical genres. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve been boxed to a certain sound because I\u2019ve done it for over 10 years,\u201d Savage said. The 10-song soundtrack included collaborations with French Nigerian singer Asa on the folk song \u201cEmotions,\u201d\u00a0American gospel artist Zacardi Cortez on \u201cI Need You,\u201d and Richard Bona & The Cavemen on the jazz track \u201cWater & Garri.\u201d \u201cCreating the soundtrack allowed me to explore those different genres, and I think I didn\u2019t feel like I would have been able to do that as Tiwa Savage,\u201d she said. \u201c(So) I was able to explore those pockets of my talent.\u201d \u00a0 The singer admits she has always loved Jazz, R&B, and gospel music, but after acting in \u201cWater & Garri\u201d and performing the soundtrack, she says has discovered how much she has grown as an artist and feels encouraged to be limitless in her creativity. \u201cI\u2019m not limiting myself to the sound that people know me for; I\u2019ve definitely grown even in a performance \u2013 like I used to have a lot of dances and do routines,\u201d the singer-turned-actress explained. \u201cNow I think I\u2019m more about vocal delivery,\u201d she added. \u201cGoing forward from that \u2026 I feel like I can do anything.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/africa/tiwa-savage-water-and-garri-nigeria-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_04_10_style_graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers", "text": "Climbing up abandoned, unfinished floors and tightrope walking across balcony ledges, backpacks clanging with cans of alkyd and acrylic, a collective of Los Angeles graffiti artists have transformed their craft beyond urban aesthetics to champion community issues. Their choice of canvas: Oceanwide Plaza in Downtown LA. Occupying over a full square city block, the plaza was imagined as a vast mixed-use building project, offering city residents over 500 lavish condominiums, a five-star hotel, retail spaces, restaurants and a private 2-acre park. However, construction on the $1 billion project, which began in 2015, was shelved after the Chinese-backed contractor Oceanwide Holdings ran out of funding\u00a0in 2019 \u2014 and it has lain unfinished ever since. The plaza\u2019s status \u2014 and potential \u2014 as an eye-catching venue for their work spread by word of mouth within the graffiti community in recent months. Security at the site was known to be lax, an important detail as accessing the plaza\u2019s towers and other buildings constitutes trespassing. (The Los Angeles City Attorney confirmed to CNN that, as of April 3, criminal charges have been filed against 23 individuals, for violations including trespassing and possession of vandalism tools.) \u201cIt was like a gift from the graffiti gods\u2026 A giant canvas in the middle of downtown,\u201d tagger ENDEM told CNN, speaking on behalf of himself and his graffiti crew, NCT. \u201cWe were like, \u2018Let\u2019s do it right. Let\u2019s do it as if the whole world is going to see this.\u2019\u201d Historically, graffiti has often been used as protest art. While the practice dates back thousands of years, it\u2019s most commonly viewed in a contemporary context (within graffiti\u2019s \u201cmodern\u201d era, which dates back to the 1960s and 70s) as a creative vehicle for challenging societal norms and inequities \u2014 whether on the Berlin Wall in Germany or subway cars in New York City; whether painted by anonymous artists or well-known figures like Keith Haring or Banksy, even if the latter is, technically, anonymous himself. Still, neither ENDEM nor any of the other artists involved realized how famous their work on the Oceanside towers would become. Sharing his artwork on Instagram on January 31, a video from ENDEM quickly racked up tens of thousands of views: Vibrant images of bright block lettering splayed across the building\u2019s exterior paired with footage from the inside \u2014 the artist posing with shots of his spray paint cans, poised above the cityscape. The viral footage, among other visuals shared on social media, quickly opened the floodgates. Hitting Oceanside became a mark of credibility in the graffiti world; by mid-February, the number of tags and other graffiti pieces there were multiplying overnight. \u201cIt was an open house people going in and out. It was beautiful. It was like graffiti paradise,\u201d ENDEM said. \u201cIt felt exactly like the streets, but concentrated.\u201d Transformed in part into an art installation, Oceanwide became an opportunity for the graffiti artists to leave a message to the city below, and a call-out to policy makers who leave buildings to rot. \u201cGraffiti shows you where the city hurts,\u201d Roger Gastman, owner and founder of the LA-based arts organization Beyond the Streets, told CNN. Renowned for its large-scale exhibitions, immersive educational programs, pop-up events and partnerships, Beyond the Streets works to educate and celebrate the diverse dimensions of graffiti as a medium. To him, the mission of graffiti is clear: to challenge, educate, and redefine public perception of the medium. Earl Ofari Hutchinson, president of The Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable, a nonpartisan public policy forum\u00a0for civic participation and education,\u00a0sees the abandoned towers as amplifying the social issues of the community they are situated in, connecting the graffiti-laden structures to the urban blight that surrounds them in LA\u2019s Skid Row. Skid Row is a 50-block sector of downtown LA where between 8,000 and 11,000 unhoused people live in challenging, often squalid conditions. \u201cYou\u2019ve got tens of thousands of people displaced because of over urban development. And as a result of that, they\u2019re on the streets,\u201d Hutchinson told CNN, noting that the homeless population in Los Angeles is continuing to grow. (The Los Angeles Housing Services Authority reports a 9% increase in homelessness in LA county in 2023 and a 10% increase in the city from 2022.) \u201cNow, set right in the middle of that, you have\u2026 a development that will never be completed.\u201d \u201cWhat you have here is a classic urban nightmare brought on by very poor policies \u2014 fiscal, financial, budgetary and political problems (in) a city that has just gone off the rails in terms of over-development and lack of affordability,\u201d Hutchinson added. Still, Hutchinson is no fan of the graffiti either. To him, and many other LA residents who have said they disapprove of the \u201cvandalism,\u201d the plaza is a sore sight for eyes. \u201cThe problem is you\u2019re talking about violating public space and with no permission\u2026 that doesn\u2019t fly with me,\u201d Hutchinson said. \u201cThe fact of the matter is, the public has not given you approval. (And) the general public has to pay for the removal.\u201d Costs currently borne by the taxpayer at the Oceanwide Plaza site include the security details provided by the LAPD as well as the graffiti cleanup Hutchinson highlights. (\u201cThis has strained our deployment,\u201d LAPD Chief Michel Moore said during a February meeting of the Los Angeles City Council. \u201cWe have called in some officers on an overtime basis so that we can provide for these added patrols or station them at that site to deter vandals and others from gaining access.\u201d) Clean teams working in the neighborhoods surrounding Oceanwide remove on average some 2,000 square feet of graffiti per week, with that figure growing in recent months. \u201cPeople forget that people live here. People own businesses here and they don\u2019t want to have to spend the time and money to clean it up,\u201d said Blair Besten, executive director of the Historic Core of Downtown Los Angeles, an organization which works to improve the quality of life in downtown neighborhoods. The Historic Core prioritizes street sweeping, trash collection \u2014 and graffiti removal. \u201cI would hardly call what they\u2019re doing art,\u201d Besten argued of the Oceanwide taggers. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty sloppy and quick. They come in fast and they knock it out and they leave.\u201d But to Gastman, graffiti is a powerful form of expression, and a call-to-action \u2014 particularly for those who emanate from struggles within home life, gang life or societal turmoil. Graffiti culture can offer an unexpected support system for those the city has abandoned, Gastman said. It becomes a platform for them to make their voices heard. \u201cIn graffiti culture, a lot of us know each other. We\u2019re all friends. We have the same mentality \u2014 we\u2019re just trying to get up. We\u2019re just trying to get noticed,\u201d explained ENDEM. In the midst of an addiction that led to his rock bottom, graffiti became his lifeline, he explained. \u201cI was at my lowest of lows, still trying to stay sober, I needed some type of outlet,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cGraffiti is something that you can hold on to. Its bigger than me, its everyone, it\u2019s a community.\u201d In this, ENDEM believes that the beauty of Oceanwide isn\u2019t tangible. Rather, it lies in the birth of a new generation of graffiti writers. \u201cThey can erase the graffiti on buildings, but they can never erase the impact that it has on the city of Los Angeles and the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to it. Yes, it\u2019s vandalism. Yes, it\u2019s art, and it\u2019s everything in between,\u201d Gastman concluded. \u201cThis is a real culture. It\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/10/style/graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_20_style_hank-willis-thomas-loverules-advert-culture", "text": "In Seattle\u2019s Henry Art Gallery,\u00a0an open, oval room is covered wall-to-wall in women, the visuals spanning a full century from 1915 to 2015. The artist Hank Willis Thomas is pointing to one of the images: of two well-dressed, neatly coiffed men standing atop a cliff. Below them, a woman is hanging from the peak with a rope. \u201cAnyone want to guess what this is an ad for?\u201d he asks a group previewing his latest show, \u201cLOVERULES,\u201d on the afternoon of its opening day. \u201cSweaters?\u201d someone posits. Somehow, they\u2019re correct. The piece is from Thomas\u2019 largest body of work, \u201cUnbranded: A Century of White Women.\u201d The 2015 series \u2014 one of many resurfaced for the \u201cLOVERULES\u201d\u00a0exhibit \u2014 features 101 print adverts (one ad per year), from which Thomas has removed the relevant logos and copy, inviting the viewer to reckon with historical records of femininity and its commodification. The aforementioned image \u2014 for Drummond Sweaters \u2014 was initially printed in a 1959 issue of \u201cEsquire\u201d magazine. A chorus of scoffs echo throughout the gallery room as Thomas reads its original text: \u201cMen are better than women! Indoors, women are useful \u2014 even pleasant. On a mountain they are something of a drag.\u201d \u201cLOVERULES\u201d threads together Thomas\u2019 most significant practices and themes, particularly the impact of corporate branding, the construction of gender and race, and the evolution of power struggles across movements for liberation. \u201cWhat does it mean to look at an object that was made to have a three to six month shelf life 40 years later?\u201d Thomas asked, speaking about the show with CNN. For those in the gallery room, it means discomfort or even disgust when considering an image of a woman with mascara running down her eyes and what looks like a black eye, for example, or another stripped of her clothing surrounded by a group of men. (The former came from a 1963 ad for Tareyton cigarettes, appearing to make light of domestic abuse in its call for \u201caggressive loyalty\u201d from customers; the latter, in its troubling depiction of what a viewer could all too easily interpret as men preparing to sexually assault a woman, is for pants.) Throughout the \u201cUnbranded\u201d series, the viewer is confronted with the values embedded in the ethos of advertising \u2014 namely, capitalism and the ways in which those who fuel it will tokenize groups and ideas for profit. \u201cWhat is expected of us is very much informed by advertising, which typically has a specific agenda,\u201d Thomas told CNN. (In other words, buying into the inferiority of women helped sell those sweaters or cigarettes.) Over the last 20 plus years, Thomas has made a name for himself responding to culturally ingrained narratives of race, gender, class and their intersections in the United States through various mediums \u2014 from photo to fabric. Whether he\u2019s mirroring a three-point stanced football player with an enslaved person picking cotton in \u201cThe Cotton Bowl,\u201d or mimicking a maze made out of prison uniforms and American flag fabric in \u201cJustice,\u201d Thomas\u2019 work successfully identifies patterns of oppression and asks us to consider how we participate in these systems. In the complementary series, \u201cUnbranded: Reflections in Black by Corporate America,\u201d Thomas explores ways in which brands invest in or give attention to certain (and often marginalized) communities when it becomes financially convenient \u2014 in this case, the corporate appropriation of Black culture. \u201cSomewhere around the late \u201960s, I believe as a result of heightened visibility through the Civil Rights movement, corporations started to pay attention,\u201d Thomas explained of the series that assesses ads from 1968 to 2008 (and was intentionally capped when Barack Obama was elected).\u00a0Before then, he continued, \u201cpeople of color weren\u2019t seen as a worthwhile demographic to market to, or to represent.\u201d Both \u201cUnbranded\u201d series assess advertisements as a channel for understanding the place (and power) of racism and sexism throughout American history. Thomas\u2019 visual reflections of popular culture\u2019s past demand an analysis of how corporations commodify belief systems for their own gain \u2014 and, in many cases, walk back or even denounce those same beliefs should their profit stumble. (Any focus on queer life ends after a Pride campaign, say, or the celebration of Black stories stops after February sales \u2014 in other words, investment in the bottom line will always supersede investment in people or movements.) To Thomas, these tactics have become even more deceptive as ads have evolved beyond still frames. \u201cWith influencers and product placement, (this messaging) is a lot more subtle, more insidious,\u201d he argued. \u201cWe\u2019re consuming advertising information without even necessarily knowing it.\u201d Even in instances when many of us are well aware of the manipulative tactics employed by brands, that doesn\u2019t always stop us from buying in. In his series \u201cB\u00aeanded,\u201d part of which is also included in \u201cLOVERULES,\u201d Thomas merges brand logos with altered photos or backdrops to examine how we are beholden to corporations: an Amex that reads \u201cThe Afro-American Express,\u201d its central photo of enslaved people crowded on a ship. Close by is an image of a chest covered in scars in the shape of Nike\u2019s logo, speaking to, as Thomas shared, \u201chow slaves were branded as a kind of ownership, and (how) today we brand ourselves.\u201d Also featured are two of his works reconfiguring the classic Absolut bottle silhouette, one of which resembles the Door of No Return, the symbolic gateway found in S\u00e9negal\u2019s Gor\u00e9e Island, known as the largest warehouse of enslaved Africans before they were forced onto ships abroad. Reimagined as artworks, these advertisements are what Thomas deems \u201cmessages to the future\u201d and epitomize the more platformed desires and tropes of their time. It begs the question, what of today\u2019s visual messages that we have accepted as normal should, in 40 years time, be interrogated and chastised?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/style/hank-willis-thomas-loverules-advert-culture/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_20_africa_jacob-zuma-not-eligible-for-parliament-south-africas-top-court-says-intl", "text": "South Africa\u2019s apex court has ruled that former president Jacob Zuma is not eligible to run for parliament in next week\u2019s critical general election. The unanimous ruling capped months long speculation and legal wrangling on whether the former leader of the ruling African National Congress (ANC), turned thorn in its side and public face of a rival party, would be able to stand for the country\u2019s top legislative body. Zuma was forced to resign as president in 2018 after a series of corruption scandals and internal infighting in the ANC. He was found guilty of contempt of court by the same constitutional court for his refusal to testify to an anti-corruption commission. It is that sentence that barred him from running, the court ruled on Monday. \u201c(Zuma) Is accordingly not eligible to be a member of and not qualified to stand for election to the national assembly until five years have elapsed since the completion of his sentence,\u201d read Justice Leona Theron. \u201cWe welcomed the judgement, and we think it is well reasoned. A contempt of court sentence is an extremely important sentence, and it is a sentence that cannot be treated lightly. The constitutional court has reaffirmed this,\u201d said Neeshan Balton, of the Ahmed Kathrada foundation on local television. ANC majority under threat Zuma and his newly formed uMkhonto WeSizwe Party represent a spoiler threat to the ANC, particularly in KwaZulu-Natal province. And\u00a0ANC insiders fear they could eat away at the ruling party\u2019s support there. The vote on May 29th could be the sternest test yet for the party of Nelson Mandela with scores of opposition parties vying for ballots. Many analysts believe that the party\u2019s majority is under threat. While the court ruled that Zuma is not eligible to run for MP, his party will still contest the election and his face will remain on the ballot. Nhlamulo Ndhlela, a party leader of uMkhonto WeSizwe, told CNN the court is biased against the former president and they plan to continue campaigning. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t change President Zuma being on the ballot and it doesn\u2019t stop him from leading the party,\u201d Ndhlela said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/africa/jacob-zuma-not-eligible-for-parliament-south-africas-top-court-says-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_21_middleeast_iran-president-helicopter-crash-sanctions-intl", "text": "Even before Iran\u2019s army chief Mohammad Bagheri ordered an investigation into the helicopter crash that cost the Islamic Republic the lives of two of its top politicians, blame was being laid at America\u2019s door. The body of President Ebrahim Raisi was being carefully carried from the crash site as former Foreign Minister Javad Zarif acidly told Iran\u2019s state TV that, \u201cOne of the causes of this heart-breaking incident is the United States, which by sanctioning the sale of the aviation industry to Iran caused the martyrdom of the president and his companions. The US\u2019s crime will be recorded in the minds of the Iranian people and history.\u201d US officials quickly dismissed the allegations as \u201cbaseless.\u201d There are many reasons the aging American-made, Vietnam war-era Bell 212 helicopter may have crashed. Poor maintenance or human error in the dense fog are among them. Turkish Transport Minister Abdulkadir Uraloglu has said it is too soon to comment on the cause of the crash, but initial indications suggested it was an accident due to foggy weather. But why did Iran risk both president and foreign minister on the same helicopter, when there were three used that day to carry the delegation to the dam opening on the border with Azerbaijan? When Raisi \u2013 accompanied by his Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, the provincial governor Malek Rahmati, and the influential Imam of Friday prayers in Tabriz, Mohammed Ali Alehashem \u2013 got out of the helicopter at the Qiz Ghal\u2019e dam Sunday morning visibility was good. The sun was shining as Raisi shook hands with his Azeri counterpart Ilham Aliyav at their border on the bridge over the calm waters of the Aras river in the middle of the dam. The day had got off to an apparently good start. Previously frosty relations between the two nations appeared to be warming. On the route picked by the flight crew for their journey to the regional center of Tabriz, where the president\u2019s plane was waiting, the weather was worsening. Although seasonal rains had been diminishing another weather front was moving in. Cold and wet. Fog was thickening around the rugged, remote and unforgiving 1,800 meter (5,900 feet) peaks on the direct flight path. So question one, why fly through the mountains when a detour around the range or to another destination might have been safer? The next question might be, knowing the weather was bad and having three helicopters on the journey, why put both president and foreign minister in the same aircraft? The crash, also revealed Iran\u2019s lack of readiness to deal with a calamity of this nature. There seemed to be no shortage of manpower, but they were hamstrung, lacking adequate technology. In the middle of the night while hundreds, if not thousands, of medics, mountaineers, soldiers, police and even the elite Revolutionary Guard Corps, scoured the steep mountain peaks and deep ravines it was Turkish drone AKINCI, flying loops above the clouds, that first located traces of the helicopter. For a nation that makes, uses, and exports long-range killer drones to countries like Russia for its war in Ukraine, and non-state actors like Iraqi militia and Yemen\u2019s Houthis \u2013 who are currently holding global maritime trade to ransom targeting ships in the Red Sea \u2013 they didn\u2019t appear to have a simple surveillance drone capable of the job. Shortly before AKINCI began etching its systematic surveillance pattern in the night sky Iran had also asked Turkey and Russia for night vision capable helicopters. By implication, if they had them, they couldn\u2019t get them there fast enough. This night, of apparently vital importance to Iran and its Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran\u2019s military prowess \u2013 projected through its axis of proxies in the Middle East and its ally Russia \u2013 seemed hollow. Former Foreign Minister Zarif would want the world to believe Iran\u2019s technological core has been hollowed out by US sanctions, but that allegation too is tainted by hubris. If, as he claims, the president\u2019s helicopter were victim to a paucity of quality spare parts due to US sanctions, why risk the life of the president and the foreign minister in an aircraft considered potentially unreliable. What other air transport possibilities were there, and if there were none that begs the same question, doubly so. Iran\u2019s presidents are not idle, they need to go places. Planning for better options could have been made a bigger priority. Did hubris among the president\u2019s staff or in the upper echelons of the military chose to trust to chance.

{"id": "travel_how-air-turbulence-creates-danger-in-the-skies", "text": "Air travel and turbulence have always gone hand in hand with many flights, especially long haul, experiencing spells of bumpiness. The severe episode on board a Singapore Airlines plane in which one passenger died raises concerns about how risky turbulence can be. Experts say it is extremely unlikely that most flights will result in injury or damage, but there have been numerous recent incidents in which this has occurred. Understanding what causes turbulence can help air crew and passengers mitigate its impact. \u201cTurbulence fatalities on commercial flights are fortunately very rare, but have sadly increased by one today,\u201d Paul Williams, a professor of atmospheric science at the University of Reading in the UK, said in a statement released today. Here\u2019s how air turbulence can create problems for air travelers. What is turbulence and what causes it? There are four main levels of\u00a0 turbulence \u2013 light, moderate, severe and extreme. In cases of light and moderate turbulence, passengers might feel a strain against their seatbelt, and unsecure items in the cabin may move around. However, in more serious cases, turbulence can result in passengers being thrown around the cabin, leading to severe injuries, or death. \u201cTurbulence on flights can be caused by storms, mountains, and strong air currents called jet streams,\u201d adds Williams. \u201cIn this last case, it is called clear-air turbulence, and it can be difficult to avoid because it doesn\u2019t show up on the weather radar in the flight deck.\u201d \u201cClear air turbulence is air movement created by atmospheric pressure, jet streams, air around mountains, cold or warm weather fronts or thunderstorms,\u201d according to the Federal Aviation Administration website. Pilots are sometimes warned of reports of turbulence by the Federal Aviation Administration, airline meteorology teams or even other pilots flying ahead of them in advance. However, turbulence can also occur without warning. How dangerous is it? According to the FAA, 30 passengers and 116 crew members were seriously injured due to turbulence from 2009 to 2021. Airline passenger numbers are currently estimated to be at around four billion a year, so such incidents are clearly still rare. The FAA cites turbulence as the leading cause of injuries to flight attendants and passengers in nonfatal accidents on commercial airlines. As airlines aren\u2019t required to report more minor injuries, the total number of injuries is unclear. Fatalities, such as the Singapore Airlines incident, are also extremely uncommon. A December 1997 United Airlines flight from Tokyo to Honolulu also experienced turbulence that left one person dead. \u201cTurbulence makes flights bumpy and can occasionally be dangerous,\u201d says University of Reading meteorology researcher Mark Prosser. \u201cAirlines will need to start thinking about how they will manage the increased turbulence, as it costs the industry $150\u2013500m annually in the USA alone. \u201cEvery additional minute spent traveling through turbulence increases wear-and-tear on the aircraft, as well as the risk of injuries to passengers and flight attendants.\u201d Is it getting worse? A study by the University of Reading reported that severe turbulence had increased by 55% in the past four decades due to the impact of climate change. The report, published in June 2023, found that at an average point over the North Atlantic, which is one of the world\u2019s busiest flight routes \u2013 the total yearly duration of severe turbulence had risen by 55% between 1979 and 2020. In 2022, Williams, who co-authored the study, told CNN that he believed that severe turbulence \u201ccould double or triple in the coming decades.\u201d He went on to attribute this to \u201cclear air turbulence,\u201d a type of turbulence that strikes suddenly is very difficult to avoid. According to figures from the National Transportation Safety Board, the flight crew had no warning in about 28% of turbulence-related accidents from 2009 to 2018. Williams\u2019 analysis predicted that clear-air turbulence would increase significantly across the world in the coming decades. \u201cTypically, on a transatlantic flight, you might expect 10 minutes of turbulence,\u201d he added. \u201cI think that in a few decades this may increase to 20 minutes or to half an hour. The seat belt sign will be switched on a lot more, unfortunately for passengers.\u201d Should I wear a seatbelt the entire flight unless I\u2019m going to the bathroom? The short answer to this is \u201cYes.\u201d\u00a0A 2021 report by the NTSB indicated that the majority of passengers who were injured in \u201cturbulence-related\u201d accidents were not wearing their seatbelt at the time. Since it\u2019s sometimes impossible to anticipate when an aircraft will encounter clear air turbulence, the only way to be 100% safe is to keep strapped in for the whole ride. Does it damage aircraft? In cases of extreme turbulence, \u201cwhere the airplane is tossed violently about and is impossible to control\u201d structural damage can be caused to an aircraft, according to the US National Weather Service. Recent incidents, including the one affecting the Singapore Airlines flight, have also resulted to substantial damage to the airplane cabin. Are some routes worse than others? Turbulence can occur almost anywhere and at any height, but some areas are known for being more susceptible. The Singapore Airlines flight from London to Singapore, appears to encountered severe turbulence over Myanmar after crossing Southeast Asia\u2019s Andaman Sea. After an analysis of around 150,000 different flight routes, turbulence prediction website Turbli found that the journey between Santiago, Chile and Viru Viru International airport in Bolivia to be the most bumpy, while the route between Almaty, Kazakhstan, and the capital of Kyrgyzstan, Bishkek, came in second on the list, which was released last year. Nashville, Tennessee to Raleigh/Durham in North Carolina was ranked as the North American route with the highest average turbulence.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/how-air-turbulence-creates-danger-in-the-skies/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_20_world_iron-age-fire-spain-earring-hannibal-scn", "text": "A\u00a0two-story building burned to the ground more than 2,000 years ago in the Pyrenees mountains of northeastern Iberia in Spain. The inferno consumed the wooden structure,\u00a0situated in an Iron Age settlement, killing six animals penned in the stable. The fates of the people who used the building are unknown, but details of their lives\u00a0remain preserved in handfuls of scorched clues, including bits of pottery, tools for textile work\u00a0and a metal pickax, archaeologists recently discovered. They also found one precious object: a gold earring measuring 0.8 inches (2 centimeters) long and 0.8 inches wide. It had been hidden inside a small jar concealed in a wall, perhaps to keep it safe from the hypothesized marauders\u00a0who set the fire, according to the study published Friday in the journal Frontiers in Environmental Archaeology. The site of the settlement is called Tossal de Baltarga, and thousands of years ago, a community of Iberian people known as the Cerretani occupied the village. This group predated the Roman occupation of Iberia and left their mark on the region in carvings on mountain rock. However, researchers are still piecing together clues about Cerretani life, including the meanings of these carvings, said lead study author Dr. Oriol Olesti Vila, an associate professor\u00a0at the Autonomous University of Barcelona in Spain. Scientists have uncovered several burned buildings at Tossal de Baltarga since 2011, all dating to the third century BC. Archaeologists recently excavated\u00a0a nonresidential, multipurpose structure dubbed Building G, the best-preserved building at the site. It measured about 26 feet (8 meters) long by about 7 feet (2 meters) wide, and its contents offer an unprecedented glimpse of Cerretani life in Iron Age Iberia. But the blackened ruins also preserve a darker story. The destruction of the entire settlement by fire hints that the blaze was set deliberately. And the chronology of the fire suggests that the arsonists may have been an invading army under Hannibal, the Carthaginian general who led troops against the Roman Republic and crossed the Pyrenees around this time, during the Second Punic War (218 BC\u00a0to 201 BC), the researchers wrote in the study. Lifestyle clues Though the upper floor of Building G collapsed when the supporting beams burned, it still retained traces of its former structure, with mud bricks in the eastern part of the floor and stones in the western section. One explanation is that the upper floor was divided into two distinct spaces used for different tasks, the scientists said. More than 1,000 pottery fragments from the upper floor represented a variety of vessels, used for cooking, eating, drinking and storage. Eight cooking vessels were\u00a0near-complete when found, and chemical analysis revealed that they contained organic residues: animal fats, dairy products and plants. Designs of some vessels indicated that they were acquired from another Iberian region through trade. More than a dozen weights for a loom and spindles told the researchers that the building\u2019s occupants were spinning and weaving with wool. In the stable,\u00a0scientists found the remains of a horse, four sheep and a goat. The horse was kept in a separate stall, and charred particles represented a variety of local grasses and plants as well as cultivated grains, stored there as feed for the livestock. The presence of a horse in the stable suggested that these people were wealthier than some of their neighbors, Olesti Vila said. \u201cIn antiquity, horses were not the typical animal that a normal peasant family would have,\u201d as they were expensive to feed and weren\u2019t kept for their meat or milk, Olesti Vila said.\u201cIn general, horses are connected with the elite.\u201d This finding provided archaeologists with another important clue about social structure in ancient Iberia, introducing the possibility of an \u201caristocrat\u201d class, the study authors wrote. A \u2018moment in time\u2019 Their discoveries illuminate the lifestyles of the Cerretani, indicating textile work and the use of agriculture and of natural resources. Analysis of the hidden earring revealed traces of silver mixed with local gold, showing that the Cerretani were also familiar with metalworking. Uncovering a \u201cmoment in time\u201d such as this is exceptional in the archaeological record, said Dr. Bettina Arnold, a professor in the department of anthropology at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, who was not involved in the research. The site provides important insights into the daily lives of Iberian Iron Age populations in the Pyrenees at this pivotal time in history, Arnold said in an email. \u201cThe most impressive aspect of the excavation of Building G is the range of the scientific analyses carried out on the finds recovered there, which reveals a community that was self-sufficient with regard to some production activities, such as spinning and weaving wool,\u201d Arnold said. However, the analysis also showed that this community was part of a larger regional exchange network \u201cthrough trade and presumably bonds of obligation,\u201d linking them to Iberian tribal leadership, she added. Deadly attack The fact that the animals died inside the stable offered the researchers another clue about the terrible circumstances of the fire. During the Iron Age, when people lived in wooden homes heated by fires, buildings often accidentally burned. But had this been such a fire, the animals\u2019 owners would likely have opened the stable doors to save their livestock, Olesti Vila said. They would probably also have returned after the fire died down to retrieve their hidden treasure \u2014 the gold earring that they concealed in a jar. \u201cThis is also an indication of some kind of conflict or some kind of violent aggression,\u201d Olesti Vila said. The scientists suspected that the community may have been caught up in the Second Punic War and the crossing of Hannibal, \u201cbecause of the chronology and the context,\u201d but because the precise date of the fire is unknown, this connection is just a hypothesis, he said. Indeed, the existence of violent raids between Iron Age populations in Europe, with bands of invaders making\u00a0off with valuables, livestock and even people, \u201cis well attested archaeologically,\u201d Arnold added, \u201cand need not be associated with a specific historic event like Hannibal\u2019s campaigns.\u201d Mindy Weisberger is a science writer and media producer whose work has appeared in Live Science, Scientific American and How It Works magazine.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/world/iron-age-fire-spain-earring-hannibal-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "travel_air-turbulence-climate-getting-worse", "text": "Most of us have experienced turbulence while traveling: when your plane flies through clashing bodies of air moving at widely different speeds. Severe turbulence can put even the most seasoned flier on edge and make five minutes seem like an eternity. Usually it results in nothing more than a bumpy ride, but in the worst cases it can cause damage, injury and \u2013 in the case of Singapore Airlines flight SQ321 on May 21 - fatality. In nonfatal accidents, turbulence is the leading cause of injuries to flight attendants and passengers, according to the Federal Aviation Administration, and it\u2019s one of the most common airline accident types today, according to the US National Transportation Safety Board. It costs US airlines \u2013 due to injuries, delays and damages \u2013 up to $500 million per year, according to the National Center for Atmospheric Research. \u201cThere is a scale for measuring how strong turbulence is,\u201d Paul Williams, a professor of atmospheric science at the University of Reading in the UK, told CNN in 2022. \u201cThere\u2019s light turbulence, which is a bit of strain against your seat belt, but food service can continue and you can probably walk around the cabin, maybe with some difficulty. \u201cThen there\u2019s moderate turbulence, a definite strain against seat belts, anything that\u2019s not secured will be dislodged, and walking is difficult; flight attendants are usually instructed to take their seats. \u201cThe worst kind is severe turbulence: This is stronger than gravity, so it can pin you to your seat and if you\u2019re not wearing your seat belt you\u2019ll be tossed around inside the cabin. This is the kind of turbulence that causes serious Injuries \u2013 it\u2019s been known to break bones, for example.\u201d Strikes fast and no visual clues About 65,000 aircraft suffer moderate turbulence every year in the US, and about 5,500 run into severe turbulence. These numbers, however, might be destined to grow. Williams believes that climate change is modifying turbulence, and started studying the subject in 2013. \u201cWe ran some computer simulations and found that severe turbulence could double or triple in the coming decades,\u201d he says. The findings, which were later confirmed by observations, highlight a type of turbulence called \u201cclear air turbulence,\u201d which isn\u2019t connected to any visual clues such as storms or clouds. Unlike regular turbulence, it hits suddenly and is hard to avoid. According to the NTSB, between 2009 and 2018, the flight crew had no warning in about 28% of turbulence-related accidents. Williams\u2019 analysis predicts that clear-air turbulence will increase significantly around the globe by the period 2050-2080, in particular along the busiest flight routes, and the strongest type of turbulence will increase the most. That doesn\u2019t mean, however, that flying will be less safe. \u201cPlanes are not going to start falling out of the sky, because aircraft are built to very high specification and they can withstand the worst turbulence they can ever expect to encounter, even in the future,\u201d says Williams. However, the average duration of turbulence will increase. \u201cTypically, on a transatlantic flight, you might expect 10 minutes of turbulence. I think that in a few decades this may increase to 20 minutes or to half an hour. The seat belt sign will be switched on a lot more, unfortunately for passengers.\u201d The seat belt sign is now switched on Keeping your seat belt fastened at all times while seated is the best way to minimize the risk of injury due to turbulence. Flight attendants, however, are more exposed to that risk than passengers and sustain approximately 80% of all turbulence-related injuries. \u201cWe\u2019re the most likely to get hurt because we\u2019re up working, pushing 300-pound carts, even when there\u2019s some sort of warning,\u201d Sara Nelson, a United flight attendant with more than two decades of experience and the president of the Association of Flight Attendants, a union representing 50,000 flight attendants across 20 airlines, told CNN in 2022. \u201cWe have flight attendants who have been thrown into the ceiling and then back down several times, resulting in broken limbs. In the aisle, with unannounced turbulence, we had people who lost toes, or lost the ability to work, or sustained injuries that kept them off the job for years,\u201d she adds. The aviation industry is taking the problem very seriously, Nelson says, but the transition to sustainable fuel must accelerate to tackle the climate crisis, and some regulations need to change. For example, the ability for children under the age of two to fly on their parents\u2019 lap. \u201cThat is totally unsafe and our union has been calling for a seat for every person on board,\u201d Nelson says. \u201cNot only can a child be thrown around the cabin, but when they come down they can actually hurt someone else, too. When a child is born, you can\u2019t leave the hospital unless you have a properly installed car seat. The same standards must be applied to flying.\u201d Calls for stringent new rules The NTSB held a public meeting about turbulence in 2021, during which it offered the same recommendation, along with more stringent rules about fastening seat belts for both passengers and flight attendants when the aircraft is flying in the vicinity of thunderstorms and under 20,000 feet, as most injuries occur under these conditions. It also recommended to streamline the systems for collecting and sharing turbulence reports, because that information isn\u2019t traveling widely or promptly enough at the moment. While the effects of climate change on turbulence will take many years to become obvious, Nelson believes some worsening has already occurred. \u201cThis is of course anecdotal, but from Hurricane Katrina forward there seems to have been a pickup in the activity of turbulence, especially turbulence that comes with no warning,\u201d she says. Her worst ever turbulence experience occurred during a flight to Dallas, which was eventually diverted. \u201cWhen anything happens on the plane, the passengers look to us, to see if we look concerned,\u201d she adds. \u201cI was flying with a very good friend of mine and we were strapped in on the jump seats, facing the back of the aircraft \u2013 so there was a lavatory in front of us, instead of passengers. \u201cThank goodness, because we were clutching each other and we were getting thrown around in our seats so violently that it felt like our brains were getting scrambled. It went on for a very long time, but luckily we got safely on the ground,\u201d she says. \u201cTypically I\u2019m not scared of turbulence, because it\u2019s something that we\u2019re taught about in training and we know what to do to protect ourselves. But it is possible to have turbulence so bad and go on for so long that even knowing all of that, my friend and I were praying \u2013 and I have to say I was scared for my life.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/air-turbulence-climate-getting-worse/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_20_climate_doomsday-glacier-melt-antarctica-climate-intl", "text": "Ocean water is pushing miles beneath Antarctica\u2019s \u201cDoomsday Glacier,\u201d making it more vulnerable to melting than previously thought, according to new research which used radar data from space to perform an X-ray of the crucial glacier. As the salty, relatively warm ocean water meets the ice, it\u2019s causing \u201cvigorous melting\u201d underneath the glacier and could mean global sea level rise projections are being underestimated, according to the study published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The Thwaites Glacier in West Antarctica \u2014 nicknamed the \u201cDoomsday Glacier\u201d because its collapse could cause catastrophic sea level rise \u2014 is the world\u2019s widest glacier and roughly the size of Florida. It\u2019s also Antarctica\u2019s most vulnerable and unstable glacier, in large part because the land on which it sits slopes downward, allowing ocean waters to eat away at its ice. Thwaites, which already contributes 4% to global sea level rise, holds enough ice to raise sea levels by more than 2 feet. But because it also acts as a natural dam to the surrounding ice in West Antarctica,\u00a0scientists have estimated\u00a0its complete collapse could ultimately lead to around 10 feet of sea level rise \u2014 a catastrophe for the world\u2019s coastal communities. Many studies have pointed to the immense vulnerabilities of Thwaites. Global warming, driven by humans burning fossil fuels, has left it\u00a0hanging on \u201cby its fingernails,\u201d according to a 2022 study. This latest research adds a new and alarming factor into projections of its fate. A team of glaciologists \u2014 led by scientists from the University of California, Irvine \u2014 used high resolution satellite radar data, collected between March and June last year, to create an X-ray of the glacier. This allowed them to build a picture of changes to Thwaites\u2019 \u201cgrounding line,\u201d the point at which the glacier rises from the seabed and becomes a floating ice shelf. Grounding lines are vital to the stability of ice sheets, and a key point of vulnerability for Thwaites, but have been difficult to study. \u201cIn the past, we had only sporadic data to look at this,\u201d said Eric Rignot, professor of Earth system science at the University of California at Irvine and a co-author on the study. \u201cIn this new data set, which is daily and over several months, we have solid observations of what is going on.\u201d They observed seawater pushing beneath the glacier over many miles, and then moving out again, following the daily rhythm of the tides. When the water flows in, it\u2019s enough to \u201cjack up\u201d the surface of the glacier by centimeters, Rignot told CNN. He suggested the term \u201cgrounding zone\u201d may be more apt than grounding line, as it can move nearly 4 miles over a 12-hour tidal cycle, according to their research. The speed of the seawater, which moves considerable distances over a short time period, increases glacier melt because as soon as the ice melts, freshwater is washed out and replaced with warmer seawater, Rignot said. \u201cThis process of widespread, enormous seawater intrusion will increase the projections of sea level rise from Antarctica,\u201d he added. Ted Scambos, a glaciologist at the University of Colorado Boulder, who was not involved in the study, called the research \u201cfascinating and important.\u201d \u201cThis finding gives a process that, as yet, is not factored into models,\u201d he told CNN. And while these results only apply to certain areas of the glacier, he said, \u201cthis could speed up the pace of ice loss in our forecasts.\u201d One uncertainty to be unraveled is whether the rush of seawater beneath Thwaites is a new phenomenon or whether it\u2019s been significant but unknown for a long time, said James Smith, a marine geologist at the British Antarctic Survey, who was not involved in the study. \u201cEither way, it\u2019s clearly an important process that needs to be incorporated into ice sheet models,\u201d he told CNN. Noel Gourmelen, a professor of Earth observation at the University of Edinburgh, said use of radar data for this study was interesting. \u201cIronically it\u2019s by going to space, using our growing satellite capabilities, that we\u2019re learning much more about this environment,\u201d he told CNN. There are still many unknowns on what the study\u2019s findings mean for the future of Thwaites, said Gourmelen who was not involved in the research. It is also unclear how widespread this process is around Antarctica, he told CNN, \u201calthough it is highly likely that this is happening elsewhere as well.\u201d A regime change Antarctica, an isolated and complex continent, appears to be increasingly vulnerable to the climate crisis. In a separate study, also published Monday, researchers from the British Antarctic Survey looked at the reasons for the record low levels of sea ice surrounding Antarctica last year. Analyzing satellite data and using climate models, they found this record low would have been \u201cextremely unlikely to happen without the influence of climate change.\u201d Sea ice melting doesn\u2019t directly affect sea level rise because it\u2019s already floating, but it leaves coastal ice sheets and glaciers exposed to waves and warm ocean waters, making them much more vulnerable to melting and breaking up. The researchers also used climate models to predict the potential speed of recovery from such extreme sea ice loss and found that even after two decades, not all the ice will return. \u201cThe impacts of Antarctic sea ice staying low for over twenty years would be profound, including on local and global weather,\u201d Louise Sime, a co-author on the BAS study, said in a statement. The findings add to evidence over the last few years that the region is facing a \u201clasting regime shift,\u201d the authors wrote.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/climate/doomsday-glacier-melt-antarctica-climate-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "world"}}

There\u2019s the Art Deco curved crown of the Chrysler Building, the sweeping isosceles triangles that twist around One World Trade Center, the stepped limestone and granite rectangles of the Empire State Building and the triangular prism of the Flatiron Building. And now, a multi-billion-dollar tower featuring floor-to-ceiling glass will add another dimension to the cityscape, according to new details unveiled by New York City Mayor Eric Adams this week. Stretching up 62 stories, a planned office tower at 350 Park Avenue will provide space for more than 6,000 jobs, plus 1.8 million square feet of commercial office space, according to a press release. It will be funded by Vornado Realty Trust, Kenneth Griffin, founder and CEO of global investment firm Citadel, and building and management company Rudin. White columns will frame a new public concourse at the base of the new building on Park Avenue, complete with green space, seating and art displays, images show. Above, landscaped terraces will top each section of the glass-clad tower which will house the offices for Citadel and market making firm Citadel Securities. Adams hailed the project in the release, saying it will help \u201csupercharge our economy and expand New York City\u2019s iconic skyline,\u201d building on \u201ccontinued efforts to energize Midtown Manhattan as the world\u2019s most important business address and an economic engine for working-class New Yorkers.\u201d Architects Foster + Partners have designed the building, which will replace the existing 30-story tower currently at the site in Midtown Manhattan just a few blocks away from landmarks like the Rockefeller Center, St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral and Grand Central Station. As New York continues to deal with the economic aftershocks wrought by the Covid-19 pandemic, Adams and his administration said in their respective statements that they hoped this project would continue the city\u2019s recovery. \u201cThis investment opens a new chapter for Midtown \u2014 and closes the book on those who predicted its demise,\u201d said deputy mayor for operations Meera Joshi. \u201cMidtown\u2019s revitalization is being led by its public realm \u2014 including investments in Fifth Avenue, with the crown jewels of Central Park and Bryant Park at either end. Together, with our business improvement district and parks partners, we are reintroducing Fifth Avenue to the world and creating a vibrant live, work, play community for a new era,\u201d Joshi added. Building this new office space comes at a fraught time for the commercial real estate market as businesses struggle to entice workers back to the office after years of working from home. This has left vast tranches of office space vacant or underused, causing the value of such buildings to plummet at the same time as historically high interest rates have made it harder for real estate developers \u2014\u00a0who often take out huge loans to finance projects \u2014\u00a0to make good on their repayments. The project will begin the city\u2019s public review process early next year and the tower is expected to be completed by 2032, according to the release.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/20/style/park-avenue-skyscraper-new-york-skyline-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_17_tech_voice-actors-ai-lawsuit-lovo", "text": "Voice actor Paul Skye Lehrman took a job in 2020 for which he believed he was providing a set of one-off voice samples. Years later, he says he heard his voice narrating a YouTube video and then on a podcast \u2014 even though he had never recorded either of them. Now, Lehrman, along with fellow voice actor Linnea Sage, is suing AI firm Lovo for allegedly commissioning them for voice projects under false pretenses in order to create and sell AI-generated versions of their voices. The Berkeley, California based tech company advertises AI-generated voice technology to be used in marketing, education and product demos. Lehrman and Sage are suing Lovo and seeking class action status to include other people \u201cwhose voices and/or identities were stolen and used,\u201d according to the complaint filed Thursday in the Southern District Court of New York. The complaint was first reported by the New York Times. The voice actors\u2019 lawsuit is just the latest in a recent string of legal actions brought against various tech companies by creatives, writers and artists who say their work was used without their permission to train AI systems that could ultimately compete with them. Such lawsuits have added to a growing wave of concerns over how the training of AI models, which requires huge swaths of data, could run afoul of copyright and intellectual property laws. \u201cImplicit in LOVO\u2019s offerings to its customers is that each voice-over actor has agreed to LOVO\u2019s terms and conditions for customers to be able to access that actor\u2019s voice,\u201d the complaint states. But for Lehrman and Sage and any others \u201cwho have not agreed to LOVO\u2019s terms, the continued unauthorized use of Plaintiffs\u2019 voices is theft of service and misappropriation.\u201d Lovo did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit. In May 2020, Lehrman says he received a request for voice-over narrative services on the gig work website Fiverr from an account called \u201cUser25199087.\u201d When he asked what the voice sample was for, he was told it would be used \u201cfor academic research purposes only\u201d and that \u201cthe scripts would not be used for anything else,\u201d according to the complaint. He was paid $1,200 for the job, the complaint states. Two years later, Lehrman came across a YouTube video that sounded as if it had his voice narrating it, although he\u2019d never been involved in its creation, the complaint states. Then in June 2023, Lehrman claims he heard his voice being used on a podcast about the dangers of AI technologies. Similarly, Sage was offered a job on Fiverr in 2019 producing \u201ctest scripts for radio ads\u201d that she was told would \u201cnot be disclosed externally,\u201d according to the complaint. She was paid $400. Sage says she later also discovered her voice in a YouTube video: a recording of a Lovo investor presentation demonstrating its technology. Lehrman and Sage allege that the people who contacted them on Fiverr were Lovo employees who misrepresented what their voice samples would be used for and later sold or raised money on the back of the AI-version of their voices. \u201cTo be clear, the product that customers purchase from LOVO is stolen property. They are voices stolen by LOVO and marketed by LOVO under false pretenses,\u201d the complaint states. The actors are seeking more than $5 million in damages, as well as a court order blocking Lovo from continuing the alleged use of their voices.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/tech/voice-actors-ai-lawsuit-lovo/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "world"}}

Voting took place in six constituencies across Mumbai in the western state of Maharashtra, and 43 others nationwide, on Monday as millions flocked to polling booths to determine who will lead the world\u2019s most populous country. Across India\u2019s richest city and the birthplace of the Bollywood movie industry, a bevy of celebrities were photographed casting their ballot, showing off purple-streaked index fingers \u2013 a sign that determines one has voted in an Indian election. The \u201cKing of Bollywood\u201d Shah Rukh Khan was seen leaving a Mumbai polling booth with his family \u2013 wife Gauri, daughter Suhana, and sons Aryan and Abram. Elsewhere, one of India\u2019s most famous actors, Amitabh Bachchan, also cast his vote at a polling booth in the suburb of Andheri. \u201cAs responsible Indian citizens we must exercise our right to vote this Monday in Maharashtra,\u201d Khan wrote on X over the weekend. \u201cLet\u2019s carry out our duty as Indians and vote keeping our country\u2019s best interests in mind. Go forth Promote, our right to Vote.\u201d Film stars Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh, who are expecting their first child this year, were also pictured, as well as billionaire industrialist Mukesh Ambani with his wife, Nita and son Akash. After casting his vote on Monday, actor Akshay Kumar said he wanted to see India become \u201cdeveloped and strong.\u201d Showing his ink-stained finger to local reporters, he added: \u201cI voted\u2026 India should vote for what they deem is right\u2026I think voter turnout will be good.\u201d But in keeping with previous elections, voter turnout in Mahrashtra on Monday remained low at 54% \u2014 with 47-55% across Mumbai\u2019s six constituencies \u2014 according to data from the Election Commission. By comparison, in the northeastern state of West Bengal, some 73% of eligible voters cast their ballot, data showed. The key election players in the city are Modi\u2019s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the main opposition Indian National Congress, and two rival factions of Shiv Sena \u2014 a local ultranationalist grouping that has long played a key role in Mumbai\u2019s politics. Mumbai, a city of more than 12 million, is often likened to New York and referred to as the \u201ccity of dreams,\u201d where millions of migrants from across the country arrive to make their fortune and find purpose. It\u2019s a city of extreme wealth and extreme poverty, where skyscrapers tower over slum dwellings and poor children beg for money at the windows of chauffeur-driven cars carrying students to school. And while the rich and famous were seen casting their vote, many migrant workers in the city will be left out of the election. Under India\u2019s election rules, eligible voters can only cast ballots in their constituencies \u2013 meaning those working outside of their state have to return home to vote. For many out-of-state workers, especially underprivileged daily-wage workers in the unorganized sector, that\u2019s nearly impossible, due to the cost associated with traveling home. Many voters in Mumbai are concerned with growing inflation and are seeking better education and employment opportunities. \u201cThe change I want to see is, things should become less costly,\u201d 34-year-old grocer Sachin Chaudhary, previously told CNN, adding he also wants to see better opportunities in the employment sector.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/india/india-bollywood-mumbai-vote-general-election-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_21_middleeast_israel-netanyahu-interview-icc-intl-latam", "text": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denied allegations that he was starving Palestinians in Gaza as a method of war in an interview with CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on Tuesday, saying an arrest warrant application currently under review in the International Criminal Court (ICC) is based on a \u201cpack of lies.\u201d ICC prosecutor Karim Khan announced Monday that he had requested arrest warrants for three Hamas leaders and two Israeli politicians \u2013 Netanyahu and Israel\u2019s Defense Minister Yoav Gallant \u2013 on allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity over the October 7 attacks in Israel and the subsequent war in Gaza. Khan said the accusations against Netanyahu and Gallant include \u201ccausing extermination, causing starvation as a method of war, including the denial of humanitarian relief supplies, deliberately targeting civilians in conflict.\u201d Speaking to Tapper, Netanyahu called Khan a \u201crogue prosecutor that has put false charges and created false symmetries that are both dangerous and false\u201d and insisted that Israel has been allowing food and medical aid to enter Gaza, where aid groups say that the blockaded Palestinian enclave is currently at risk of famine. Israel has allowed 20,000 trucks of aid into Gaza, Netanyahu said \u2013 a fraction of what would have entered in the same period under normal times. Israel\u2019s ongoing siege of Gaza, following Hamas\u2019 October 7 terror attacks, has reached its seventh month and left more than 34,000 people dead. Serious questions about the Israeli military\u2019s long-term strategy have been raised both inside and outside of Israel after the Israeli military sent troops back into areas of northern Gaza, an area it had previously declared clear of Hamas. Last week, Israel\u2019s defense chief Gallant\u00a0called on Netanyahu\u00a0to publicly rule out Israeli governance over the Gaza Strip and to lay out his\u00a0post-war plans for civilian rule in Gaza, warning that he opposes Israeli rule in the Palestinian enclave. When Netanyahu was asked by Tapper if he would rule out the Israeli occupation of Gaza, the Israeli politician said that \u201cresettling\u201d the Palestinian territory was out of the question. \u201cYou mean resettling Gaza? Yeah. It was never in the cards, and I said so openly [and] some of my constituents are not happy about it, but that\u2019s my position.\u201d The prime minister also reaffirmed his commitment to eradicating Hamas, which governs Gaza, before considering demilitarizing the Strip, in the interview. With more than 100 hostages still believed to be held in Gaza, pressure has been growing for a deal that would see hostages released in exchange for a ceasefire. But when asked about public polling showing that a majority of Israelis believe freeing hostages is a higher priority than military action, Netanyahu said you could not have one without the other. \u201cMilitary action that we take against Hamas is in fact the way to get these hostages because without military pressure, basically, without, you know, squeezing them, Hamas is not going to give up anything,\u201d he told Tapper. Netanyahu is deeply unpopular in Israel, where he is also facing an ongoing corruption trial. Critics have accused the Prime Minister of being beholden to members of his far-right coalition and prolonging the war to maintain his grip on power. Speaking to Tapper, Netanyahu rejected accusations that he avoids Israeli media in favor of international press, saying he has done up to 20 press conferences with Israeli journalists. \u201cThat\u2019s simply not true,\u201d he said. \u201cI speak to them and I speak to you and I welcome the opportunity to tell the truth and dispel the lies in both in both mediums.\u201d \u2018No equivalence\u2019 The ICC\u2019s application for warrants over the war in Gaza marked the first time the international court has targeted the top leader of a close ally of the United States. Israel and the US are not members of the ICC, but the court\u00a0has said that it\u00a0has\u00a0jurisdiction over Gaza, East Jerusalem, and the West Bank after Palestinian leaders formally agreed to be bound by the court\u2019s founding principles in 2015. A panel of ICC judges will now consider Khan\u2019s application for the arrest warrants. An ICC warrant would compel more than 100 member-nations of the court to arrest Netanyahu if he traveled in their territory. France was among the countries that have supported the ICC decision alongside international rights groups. Human rights organization Amnesty International has\u00a0hailed the arrest warrant request as a\u00a0\u201ccrucial step towards justice.\u201d But Israel\u2019s allies have roundly condemned\u00a0Khan\u2019s\u00a0move, with US President Joe Biden calling it \u201coutrageous.\u201d\u00a0\u201cThere is no equivalence - none - between Israel and Hamas,\u201d\u00a0Biden said.\u00a0\u00a0Several US lawmakers have threatened to levy sanctions against the ICC, and\u00a0Secretary of State Antony\u00a0Blinken\u00a0has said\u00a0he is open to legislative action against the court. The\u00a0Biden administration said earlier this month\u00a0that\u00a0it is \u201creasonable to assess\u201d that US weapons have been used by Israeli forces in\u00a0Gaza\u00a0in ways that are \u201cinconsistent\u201d with international humanitarian law \u2013 but\u00a0stopped short of officially saying Israel violated the law. Speaking to Tapper, Netanyahu likened himself to President Franklin Roosevelt, claiming the arrest warrants were like putting Nazi leader Adolf Hitler on the docks alongside the American wartime president who oversaw the US\u2019s mobilization\u00a0during World War\u00a0II. Khan previously told CNN\u2019s Christiane Amanpour that he had received international pressure over his investigation of Israel. \u201cThis court is built for Africa and for thugs like [Russian President Vladimir] Putin,\u201d Khan described one senior leader telling him.

{"id": "2024_05_20_style_kehinde-wiley-joseph-awuah-darko-sexual-assault-accusations", "text": "Kehinde Wiley, the American artist best known for painting former US President Barack Obama\u2019s official portrait, has denied accusations of sexual assault. In an Instagram post shared Sunday, British-Ghanaian artist and curator Joseph Awuah-Darko alleged Wiley sexually assaulted him twice in 2021. Awuah-Darko said the first incident occurred on June 9, 2021, at a dinner held at the Noldor Artist Residency in Ghana, to celebrate Wiley\u2019s work. Awuah-Darko is the founder and chairman of the Accra-based program. In the post, he claimed he was \u201cinappropriately groped\u201d by Wiley, in front of another guest, and that the action was \u201cunwelcome and unprovoked.\u201d He then described a second incident that day as \u201cmuch more severe and violent,\u201d without elaborating further. (In a subsequent interview with the New York Times, he claimed that \u201ca sexual encounter began consensually, but that it then moved to a bedroom, where\u2026 Mr. Wiley forced himself on him after Mr. Awuah-Darko had said he did not want to go further.\u201d) The assaults \u201calmost destroyed me,\u201d Awuah-Darko wrote in the post, adding he hoped that others would feel empowered to come forward. Shortly after the post was published, Wiley denied the allegations, writing on his own Instagram that, \u201cSomeone I had a brief, consensual relationship with almost three years ago is now making a false accusation about our time together. These claims are not true and are an affront to all victims of sexual abuse.\u201d \u201cI have no idea why he has decided to target me in this way \u2014 particularly when there is a litany of evidence showing his claims are false \u2014 but I hope he gets the help he needs for whatever he is going through,\u201d Wiley continued. \u201cI kindly ask for privacy as I work to clear my name. Representatives for Wiley provided CNN with a copy of a cease and desist letter they say was sent to Awuah-Darko demanding he immediately remove what they describe as \u201ccategorically false and defamatory,\u201d Instagram posts. The letter frames Awuah-Darko\u2019s claims as \u201cmalicious\u201d and intended to \u201cruin (Wiley\u2019s) reputation for\u2026 financial gain and attention.\u201d CNN was also shown copies of messages between Awuah-Darko and Wiley which representatives for Wiley assert were sent in the months following the alleged assault. In some, Awuah-Darko appears to be making arrangements to attend a birthday party for Wiley in Nigeria; in another he asks if he could visit Wiley at his home in upstate New York. (It appears Wiley failed to respond to this message.) Awuah-Darko and his legal representative did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s requests for further comment on his allegations, as well as Wiley\u2019s response, however, in his Sunday statement on Instagram, he said he \u201cdid not immediately confront the reality of my abuse as such,\u201d and that it took\u00a0\u201cseveral months to reconcile with what had actually happened.\u201d \u201cI am aware I\u2019m not the perfect sexual assault victim,\u201d Awuah-Darko told the New York Times, \u201cbut this is what happened to me.\u201d In an earlier Instagram video posted in March, Awuah-Darko had claimed he was \u201csexually assaulted by someone who outranks me in privilege, power\u2026\u201d and that he was aiming to raise $200,000 for legal fees. Awuah-Darko said Monday that he planned on taking legal action in a post on his Instagram stories. Awuah-Darko\u2019s legal representative did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s requests for further comment. In Sunday\u2019s Instagram post, he wrote that reporting the assault in Ghana \u201cwould have been problematic at best \u2014 dangerous at worst,\u201d given the country\u2019s broader attitudes towards LGBTQ people. In February, Ghana\u2019s parliament passed a controversial bill that criminalizes LGBTQ relationships and those who support LGBTQ rights. Wiley rose to international fame in 2017, when he was chosen to paint Obama\u2019s official portrait for the Smithsonian\u2019s National Portrait Gallery. The result was a vibrant depiction of the 44th president against a backdrop of green foliage and symbolic flowers. Before that, the Yale University-trained painter had already built a career in portraiture and sculpture, depicting Black people posed in the style of Old Master paintings to bold, ornate effect.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/style/kehinde-wiley-joseph-awuah-darko-sexual-assault-accusations/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "style_brutalist-plant-photos-c2e-spc", "text": "Austere. Stark. Cold. The common opinions about Brutalist architecture are a far cry from the way we often describe the natural world: lush, colorful, verdant. But a new photobook is exploring nature\u2019s relationship with Brutalist architecture \u2014 from a theater in Japan to a library in Canada \u2014 and finding beauty in the contrast. Called \u201cBrutalist Plants,\u201d the book is a \u201cmix of looking into the future but also looking back,\u201d said Olivia Broome, curator of the book and creator of the @brutalistplants Instagram community of more than 30,000 followers. Broome hopes the images will inspire people to look at the built environment differently \u2014 and see it as a place that can complement nature. \u201cEither we all exist in harmony with nature and concrete, or we all mess it up so badly that nature is going to overtake everything that we build,\u201d she said. Dystopia or utopia? Brutalism, sometimes referred to as \u201cNew Brutalism,\u201d is an architectural style typified by its imposing form, use of geometric shapes and clean lines, exposed concrete, and monochromatic color schemes. Its popularity peaked between the 1950s and \u201870s and it\u2019s commonly associated with the UK and Eastern Europe, but this international style has its roots in much earlier 20th-century structures from around the world, particularly those of Swiss architect Le Corbusier, whose work prioritized functionality and large, sculptural shapes. Born in the UK, Broome grew up in Geneva, Switzerland, which first sparked her interest in Brutalism. \u201cWhere I grew up, there were a lot of mountains and concrete,\u201d she said, adding that in Geneva there were a lot of buildings by Le Corbusier: \u201cLooking back, (Brutalist buildings) feel like a homely space for me.\u201d The \u201cBrutalist Plants\u201d platform started as a hobby: Broome shared images on Tumblr before she moved it to Instagram in 2018. The account reposts the work of photographers, with tags and credits, and as the community has grown into the tens of thousands, many photographers and content creators now submit work to her. Broome was attracted to the images because of the contrast of the cold concrete with the softness of nature, which has an ambiguous \u201cdystopian or utopian feel.\u201d \u201cA lot of them are quite modernist, which is a bit more like a utopia,\u201d said Broome. Some of the photos imagine \u201chow we could be living, with plants or balconies,\u201d and the inclusion of architectural renders and AI-generated scenes show hopeful visions of our stark urban world co-existing peacefully alongside nature. On the flip side, some of them have a darker feeling. \u201cThere are a few images in there where it\u2019s genuinely overgrown architectural spaces that no longer exist,\u201d she said, adding that many were submitted by urban explorers of abandoned buildings. People are notably absent from the photos; most of the images are only of architecture and nature, but in a few instances, Broome said humans have been removed from the images to focus the narrative on the built environment\u2019s relationship with nature, which Broome feels is muddled by human presence. \u201cNobody lives in the book, really. There are no human beings. It\u2019s just plants doing their thing,\u201d she added. Controversial structures Featuring 150 photos of buildings, artworks and sculptures, the book includes a mix of images shared on the Instagram account and unseen photos sourced elsewhere, said Broome. With 41 countries featured in the book, Broome is excited to show the huge spread and variety of Brutalist works, and the architectural style\u2019s influence on more recent structures and artworks. One of the \u201cmost contested images\u201d Broome shared with her audience on Instagram, which has also made the cut for the book, is of a sculpture by German artist Karsten Fo\u0308dinger. \u201cIt\u2019s this slab of concrete that sits slightly slanted, held up by pine trees in a row. It kind of looks like a table of concrete that\u2019s attached to these trees,\u201d explained Broome. Online, some people commented it was \u201cawful for the trees\u201d and an affront to nature, while others felt the unity of concrete and wood \u2014\u00a0commonly used in house building \u2014 reflected ideas of shelter and put an artistic twist on it. \u201cThere was a lot of debate back and forth,\u201d said Broome. A lot of the images hold special meaning for Broome: a photograph of a building in Geneva is \u201ctwo minute\u2019s walk\u201d from where her father lives, and some of the buildings photographed in Melbourne and Canberra in Australia are places she\u2019s visited with family and friends. Broome, who moved back to London to study design and journalism at university, now lives in the UK where there are many Brutalist buildings to provide inspiration \u2014\u00a0including the Barbican Theatre, where the book will be launched. She believes Brutalist structures should be preserved for the future \u2014 and the integration of nature shows their adaptability. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of Brutalist (architecture) that is endangered because people don\u2019t see the value,\u201d she said. \u201c(But) there are more architects, and some feature in the book, that are working to make brutalism more accessible and more beautiful, and really showcase what it can do for different spaces.\u201d Brutalist Plants, published by Hoxton Mini Press, is out on May 16, 2024", "source": "http://cnn.com/style/brutalist-plant-photos-c2e-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_18_weather_houston-storms-power-severe-weather-south", "text": "As officials assess the damage from destructive storms in the Houston area that killed at least seven people and knocked out power amid rising temperatures, residents in the Southeast and Gulf Coast face a severe weather threat through Saturday that could bring another round of excessive rainfall and severe thunderstorms. A complex of storms with winds up to 100 mph and a tornado left a trail of destruction Thursday across the Houston area that damaged multiple skyscrapers, caused a sewage spill and triggered power outages that could stretch on for weeks amid soaring temperatures. At least four people died from the storm in Houston, including two killed by fallen trees and a third who died in a crane accident, Houston Fire Chief Samuel Pe\u00f1a said Thursday. Another three storm deaths were reported in Harris County on Friday evening. One man collapsed while trying to move a downed electrical pole, and a woman died after lightning struck the trailer she was inside and sparked a fire, Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said in a post on X. Gonzalez said another victim who had lost power reportedly went out to his truck to plug in his oxygen tank and was found unresponsive Friday morning. \u201cHeartbreaking! My condolences go out to the families that lost a loved one during yesterday\u2019s severe weather event,\u201d Gonzalez said. The damaging storms will be followed by high temperatures in the 90s through the weekend and beyond while many are without air conditioning. Over 366,000 customers in Harris County remain without power Saturday evening following the line of storms, down from a peak of more than 900,000, according to PowerOutage.us. Authorities have warned that restoring power to all customers will be a lengthy process. CenterPoint Energy \u2013 the primary electrical provider in the area \u2013 said the storm system caused \u201cextensive damage to the company\u2019s transmission and distribution electric systems.\u201d Thousands of workers are being deployed to help with restoration efforts, the company said. More than 376,000\u00a0of its customers have been affected and power was restored to more than 259,000\u00a0customers in the last 24 hours as of Saturday night, the company said on its website. \u201cCenterPoint Energy is working to have restorations substantially complete to customers who are available to receive service by end of day Wednesday,\u201d CenterPoint Energy said. \u201cHardest hit areas of our territory include: Bellaire, Cypress, Baytown, Greenspoint, Humble and Spring Branch.\u201d The rainfall, combined with high winds and power outages, also resulted in the spillage of more than 100,000 gallons of domestic wastewater, otherwise known as sanitary sewage. The spillage occurred in three separate locations across the city, but Houston Public Works assured residents that drinking water from the City of Houston remains safe. With burgeoning heat, the City of Houston opened cooling centers for residents on Friday, officials said in a news release. The heat index, which measures what the body actually feels, could hit triple-digits by next week, raising health risks from weather\u2019s deadliest threat. \u201cThe weather pattern is shifting into a hot and dry pattern starting on Saturday, so it is going to be important to have a way to stay cool,\u201d the National Weather Service warned on Friday. Houston Mayor John Whitmire, who signed a local state of disaster declaration for the city on Friday, toured the downtown area and said the \u201cdevastation is significant.\u201d \u201cWe urge everyone to stay away from the area for your safety and to allow public works personnel to do their vital jobs,\u201d Whitmire said. The weather service classified the line of severe storms that moved through Texas and Louisiana Thursday as a derecho, a potentially destructive weather event characterized by widespread wind damage associated with a long-lived line of thunderstorms. Derechos have consistent wind gusts of 58 mph or greater along a path of at least 400 miles, along with several well-separated wind gusts of greater than 75 mph. The determination was made based on the path\u2019s length and intensity. More flash floods and damaging wind gusts possible Saturday Excessive rainfall and severe thunderstorm chances will persist across parts of the Southeast through Saturday, the National Weather Service said. From the Southeast to the north-central Gulf of Mexico, newly developing thunderstorms will bring the potential for more flash flooding and damaging wind gusts on Saturday, according to the National Weather Service. A slight level 2 of 5 risk of severe thunderstorms has been issued across parts of the Southeast into the Carolinas on Saturday, according to the Storm Prediction Center. \u201cIsolated to scattered severe thunderstorms appear possible across portions of the Southeast and Carolinas on Saturday, and parts of the Upper Midwest,\u201d the center said. \u201cDamaging winds should be the main threat, but occasional severe hail and a tornado or two may also occur.\u201d A slight level 2 of 4 risk of excessive rainfall has also been issued for part of the northern Gulf Coast Saturday due to the threat of flash, urban and riverine flooding, the weather service said. Heavy rain is also forecast to continue into Saturday across the Mid-Atlantic and central Appalachians, where scattered instances of flash flooding could occur. On Sunday, thunderstorms are expected to form over the central High Plains and spread east in the evening. The greatest chances for severe weather are across parts of Nebraska and Kansas, with a slight level 2 of 5 risk of severe thunderstorms issued by the Storm Prediction Center. \u201cLarge hail and damaging gusts will be the main hazards, though a tornado or two also will be possible,\u201d the center said. By the end of the weekend, thunderstorm chances will diminish for most of the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic, the weather service said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/18/weather/houston-storms-power-severe-weather-south/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "world"}}

The New Shepard rocket and capsule lifted off at 9:36 a.m. CT (10:36 a.m. ET) from the Jeff Bezos-founded company\u2019s facilities on a private ranch in West Texas. NS-25, Blue Origin\u2019s seventh crewed flight to date, carried six customers aboard the capsule: venture capitalist Mason Angel; Sylvain Chiron, founder of the French craft brewery Brasserie Mont-Blanc; software engineer and entrepreneur Kenneth L. Hess; retired accountant Carol Schaller; aviator\u00a0Gopi Thotakura; and Ed Dwight, a retired US Air Force captain selected by President John F. Kennedy in 1961 to be the nation\u2019s first Black astronaut candidate. Despite completing training at the Aerospace Research Pilot School\u00a0and receiving an Air Force recommendation, Dwight ultimately didn\u2019t make the NASA Astronaut Corps. He went on to become an entrepreneur and a sculptor; a new National Geographic documentary on Black astronauts, \u201cThe Space Race,\u201d highlights Dwight\u2019s pioneering story. \u201cI had no intention of being an astronaut. That was the last thing on my bucket list,\u201d Dwight said in the documentary. \u201cBut once I was given the challenge, then everything changes.\u201d Dwight completed that challenge and reached the edge of space at the age of 90, making him the oldest person to venture to such heights, according to a spokesperson from Blue Origin. \u201cI thought I didn\u2019t need it in my life,\u201d Dwight said of the experience on Blue Origin\u2019s livestream after the capsule touched down at 9:46 a.m. CT (10:46 a.m. ET). \u201cBut I lied. I really, really did need it.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a life-changing experience,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody needs to do this.\u201d The rocket booster landed safely a couple minutes prior to the capsule. During the mission, the crew soared to more than three times the speed of sound, or more than 2,000 miles per hour. The rocket vaulted the capsule past the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line, an area 62 miles (100 kilometers) above Earth\u2019s surface that is\u00a0widely recognized as the altitude at which outer space begins \u2014 but there\u2019s a lot of\u00a0gray area. And at the peak of the flight, passengers experienced a few minutes of weightlessness and striking views of Earth through the cabin windows. The launch followed the success of an uncrewed science mission in December \u2014 the New Shepard program\u2019s first flight since the mishap more than a year earlier. New Shepard\u2019s 2022 failure A New Shepard rocket and spacecraft were set to launch a batch of science instruments on September 12, 2022. But one minute into flight, the rocket endured Max Q \u2014 an aerospace term that refers to a moment of maximum stress on a vehicle. It occurs when the rocket is at a relatively low altitude \u2014 where the atmosphere is still fairly thick \u2014 but the spacecraft is moving at high speeds, creating a moment of intense pressure on the vehicle. Around that time, the rocket appeared to emit a massive burst of flames. The New Shepard capsule, which rides atop the rocket, then initiated its launch abort system \u2014 firing up a small engine to blast itself safely away from the malfunctioning rocket. That system worked as intended, parachuting the capsule to a safe landing. Blue Origin later\u00a0revealed\u00a0that the cause of the failure was a problem with the engine nozzle, a large cone that directs the flaming exhaust at the rocket\u2019s bottom. Onboard computers accurately detected the failure and shut the engine down, according to the company. No injuries were reported on the ground, and Blue Origin said the science payloads and the capsule could be flown again. But the rocket, left without a functioning engine, smashed back into the ground\u00a0and was destroyed. Typically after New Shepard launches, the rocket booster guides itself back to a safe upright landing so it can be flown again. During a December interview with podcaster Lex Fridman, Bezos\u00a0said the escape system that jettisoned the capsule to safety is the most difficult piece of engineering in the entire rocket \u2014 but \u201cit is the reason that I am comfortable letting anyone go on New Shepard.\u201d \u201cThe (rocket) booster is as safe and reliable as we can make it,\u201d Bezos added. \u201cThe power density is so enormous that it is impossible to ever be sure that nothing will go wrong. \u2026 So the only way to improve safety is to have an escape system. \u201cA tourism vehicle has to be designed in my view \u2026 to be as safe as one can make it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t make it perfectly safe. It\u2019s impossible.\u201d Rocket fix and return to service The Federal Aviation Administration, which licenses commercial rocket launches and is charged with ensuring public safety, oversaw an investigation into the failure. The probe revealed that the engine nozzle failed because it experienced higher temperatures than what the company had anticipated. To fix the issue, Blue Origin said it implemented \u201cdesign changes to the combustion chamber\u201d \u2014 the area of the engine where fuel explosively mixes with oxidizer \u2014 and adjusted \u201coperating parameters,\u201d or the data that the company uses to model safe flights. \u201cAdditional design changes to the nozzle have improved structural performance under thermal and dynamic loads,\u201d the company said in a March 2023\u00a0statement. The FAA formally concluded the mishap investigation on September 27, 2023, outlining 21 \u201ccorrective actions\u201d Blue Origin needed to implement before returning to flight. The agency did not reveal details on what those actions were,\u00a0noting the report\u00a0\u201ccontains proprietary data and U.S \u00a0Export Control\u00a0information and is not available for public release.\u201d The changes and New Shephard\u2019s successful December flight teed up the company to restart its trips to space for thrill seekers. Before the September 2022 failure, New Shepard rockets had flown 22 consecutive successful missions \u2014 including six with passengers on board.\u00a0Bezos flew aboard the rocket\u00a0in 2021. Other notable space tourists previously carried by the vehicle include \u201cStar Trek\u201d actor William Shatner and \u201cGood Morning America\u201d host Michael Strahan.

After securing a crucial Game 6 win on Sunday to tie the series and bring about a win-or-go-home situation, the Oilers raced into a three-goal lead in the second period and withstood a Vancouver fightback to advance. British Columbia native Ryan Nugent-Hopkins had a goal and assist. \u201cIt\u2019s something you kind of dream of as a kid,\u201d Nugent-Hopkins said, per the NHL, about scoring in Game 7. \u201cIt truly hasn\u2019t sunk in yet that it\u2019s here because you\u2019re so focused on playing, but my brother and I and kids in the neighborhood, hours on end playing road hockey, and I\u2019m definitely proud to do it with this group. \u201cI\u2019m just happy to get the win, but it\u2019s cool to do it here.\u201d Edmonton struggled to find a way past rookie goaltender Arturs Silovs in the Vancouver net for the much of the game, with the Latvian making 26 total saves. The Oilers were in control during the first frame, outshooting Vancouver 13-2 but could not find a way through in the scoreless period. The scoring was eventually opened by Cody Ceci, who drove in a powerful slap shot from the right side to give Edmonton the lead just over a minute into the second period. Zach Hyman doubled his squad\u2019s advantage when his deflected strike found its way past Silovs with 14 minutes left to play in the period. The left winger currently leads NHL in Stanley Cup Playoff goals with 11. The Oilers then took advantage of a power play 10 minutes later when Evan Bouchard\u2019s shot ricocheted off the end boards and fell kindly to Nugent-Hopkins who fired past Silovs at the near post. The Canucks, seeded first in the Pacific division, were not prepared to go down without a fight however, with Conor Garland capitalizing on a turnover to cut into Edmonton\u2019s lead. Filip Hronek\u2019s one-timer then made it a one-score game with just under five minutes left in the game, leading to some nervy moments for the Oilers down the stretch. Their defense held firm though, with a crucial block in the slot with 13 seconds to sealing the victory. \u201cWe would have preferred it to be less stressful and kind of cruise to the end of the game,\u201d said Edmonton head coach Kris Knoblauch. \u201cFor the most part, I think for 60 minutes in Edmonton and about 50 minutes here, we played a pretty good game and were solid offensively and defensively, I liked a lot of things that we did.\u201d The Blue and Orange will battle the Dallas Stars in the Conference Final for the chance to to reach the Stanley Cup Finals. The series gets underway in Dallas on Thursday. It was a tough way to end what had been a feel-good season for the Canucks, who remain one of the 11 NHL teams to never win the Stanley Cup. \u201cWe weren\u2019t going to go quietly,\u201d Garland said after the game, per the NHL. \u201cWe felt like we had a chance. It\u2019s hard to play with the lead in the playoffs. Human nature kicks in. Nobody wants to be the guy to make a mistake and sometimes teams sit back, and we knew we were going to get our looks, just had to execute.

{"id": "2024_05_16_uk_uk-sex-education-gender-schools-rishi-sunak-gbr-intl", "text": "As a general election inches closer into view, the embittered debates circulating inside British politics have entered a new arena: the classroom. New guidance unveiled by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak\u2019s government on Thursday seeks to overhaul the way sex education and gender identity is taught in England\u2019s schools, a significant intervention into a delicate topic that appeared suddenly on the front pages of Britain\u2019s newspapers a day before the announcement. The government says the revised guidance, which came amid pressure from a handful of its lawmakers, provides clarity on a complex topic, emphasizing facts over what it calls \u201ccontested views\u201d about gender identity. But critics of the plans \u2013 among them a swath of teachers and teaching union leaders \u2013 say the move is a politicized attempt to appeal to a narrow cohort of voters the government is in danger of losing, months before a general election. And they arrived amid what most see as the death throes of Sunak\u2019s flailing government, which has for months seized upon and discarded a number of divisive topics in the hopes of reversing a stubborn polling deficit. Pepe Di\u2019lasio, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders and a headteacher at a school in northern England, told CNN the plans were, in his view, driven by \u201ca political agenda at the front of a campaign season.\u201d \u201cWhen the first time you hear about those is in a headline on a tabloid newspaper, then that doesn\u2019t reassure you that the right research is taking place, and that the right level of integrity is behind the decision-making,\u201d Di\u2019lasio said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is young people, and their health and wellbeing, and their care and guidance, being used as a political football.\u201d \u2018Utterly disgraceful\u2019 The new draft guidance from the government, published Thursday, takes aim at the way sex and relationships are taught to English children in both primary and secondary schools. Those lessons have been compulsory at schools in England since 2020, but the government says it reviewed how they are taught after \u201creports of pupils being taught inappropriate content\u201d in some schools. Under the new approach, children can\u2019t be taught sex education before the age of nine, while \u201cexplicit discussion of sexual activity\u201d will be delayed until children are 13. Gender identity, or the fact that people can change gender, is meanwhile \u201chighly contested and should not be taught\u201d at all, according to the Department of Education. The government said that teaching what it calls the \u201ctheory\u201d of gender identity \u201ccould prompt some children to start to question their gender when they may not have done so otherwise\u201d \u2013 a suggestion that has been angrily contested by LGBTQ+ rights groups. \u201cIt is hard to see how rigid limits on what can be discussed and when would be in the best interests of young people \u2013 and this may even risk them seeking information from less reliable sources,\u201d Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said in a statement. Referring to the parts of the guidance that target the teaching of transgender issues, Di\u2019lasio told CNN that teachers should be allowed to discuss societal issues of the day with students, rather than have those conversations restricted. Sam Freedman, a senior adviser to the Ark education charity and a senior fellow at the Institute for Government think tank, added on X: \u201cIsn\u2019t something being highly contested a good reason to talk about it in schools - acknowledging that it is highly contested and explaining why?\u201d The plans will be subject to a nine-week consultation period, which will conclude before the start of Britain\u2019s next school year. But the uncertain timing of a general election \u2013 due by January, and expected in the second half of the year \u2013 muddies the waters further as to when, or if, the guidance will ever be implemented. And, as with many of the government\u2019s recent announcements, its unveiling was accompanied by a string of combative language that played into the \u201cculture war\u201d topics the Conservatives have increasingly sought to thrust into the national discourse. Education Secretary Gillian Keegan wrote in The Sun newspaper that \u201cteachers are there to teach children facts, not push the agendas of \u00adcampaign groups.\u201d \u201cNever again will young girls be taught they might be that \u00adlittle bit happier if they were a boy,\u201d she added. Transgender rights have been the target of heavy-handed rhetoric from the government for several months, as Sunak looks to goad his opponent, Labour leader Keir Starmer, away from debates about the economy and healthcare, and toward issues surrounding identity. Those efforts ultimately sparked huge controversy when Sunak made a transgender jibe toward Starmer in Parliament in February, while the mother of Brianna Ghey, a 16-year-old transgender girl who was murdered last year, watched from the public gallery. \u201cOne does wonder whether (the guidance) is connected to the fact that we\u2019re moving into a general election, and it is purely being used to gain votes of a particular section of society,\u201d Di\u2019lasio said. \u201cIt is utterly disgraceful that once again this government has decided to engage in private briefings and media leaks simply to grab headlines,\u201d Whiteman, the head teachers\u2019 union boss, added. \u201cThe children and young people of this country deserve better.\u201d Asked by the BBC on Thursday how widespread \u201cinappropriate\u201d teaching on gender identity was, Keegan admitted: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s widespread \u2013 I mean, I don\u2019t know, because it\u2019s not something that we\u2019ve gone and done a particular survey of.\u201d Sunak will hope this week\u2019s headlines can add ammunition to his effort to portray himself as a defender of \u201ccommon sense,\u201d a catch-all term that the prime minister frequently uses as he scrambles to maintain the support of socially conservative voters. But education specialists worry that school pupils have become the latest victim of that push. Di\u2019lasio told CNN that the guidance marked a departure from the way new instructions have historically been passed down to schools. \u201cYou may not have agreed with all of them over time, but there was always some evidence behind them. There was always some research behind them,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when a political ideology comes into it, it becomes more difficult for the whole of the education world to move behind it,\u201d he added. \u201cMy worry is that if we\u2019re not careful, there will be young people that are not cared for and not educated in the way we want them to be.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/uk/uk-sex-education-gender-schools-rishi-sunak-gbr-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_tech_microsoft-china-employees-relocate-hnk-intl", "text": "Microsoft has asked at least 100 of its employees in China to consider moving to other countries, according to Chinese state media reports. The reports come as relations between Beijing and Washington deteriorate over technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and clean energy. Microsoft employees, mostly involved with cloud computing, were recently offered the opportunity to work in the United States, Australia or Ireland, among other countries, state-run outlet The Paper said in a report Wednesday, citing an unnamed source. \u201cProviding internal opportunities is a regular part of managing our global business. As part of this process, we shared an optional internal transfer opportunity with a subset of employees,\u201d a Microsoft spokesperson told CNN on Thursday. It did not specify the number of workers who had received the offer. The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that Microsoft asked as many as 800 employees, mostly engineers with Chinese nationality working on cloud computing and AI, to consider relocating. The Journal, which cited unnamed sources, reported last year that the Biden administration was preparing to restrict Chinese firms\u2019 access to US cloud services. The company entered China in 1992 and for decades has counted on its well-known Beijing-based research lab, Microsoft Research Lab Asia, to help it build influence. \u201cEveryone is confused,\u201d an employee told the Paper, as the affected staff has been given less than a month to decide. Yicai, a Chinese state-owned financial media outlet, wrote that more than 100 employees were affected. It added that people had the option not to move. The reports come in the same week President Joe Biden\u00a0announced tariffs on $18 billion worth of imports of Chinese electric vehicles and an array of other products. Biden said he was trying to prevent unfair competition from China decimating US industries. The tech war between the two economic superpowers has been intensifying for years. In October, the Biden administration limited the types of semiconductors that American companies can sell to China. In recent months, the United States has also enlisted its allies in\u00a0Europe\u00a0and\u00a0Asia\u00a0in restricting sales of advanced chipmaking equipment to China. Beijing has\u00a0hit back\u00a0by imposing its own curbs on exports of germanium and gallium, two elements essential for making semiconductors.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/tech/microsoft-china-employees-relocate-hnk-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "world"}}
