{"id": "2024_05_22_tech_microsoft-ai-tool-privacy-recall", "text": "Microsoft\u2019s buzziest new AI feature is raising concerns that it could potentially be misused in the wrong hands. This week, the company showed off a new tool called Recall for Windows computers that acts as a personal \u201ctime machine,\u201d allowing users to quickly pull up anything that\u2019s ever been on screen, such as documents, images and websites. It\u2019s different from a keyword search; the tool regularly saves screenshots of the user\u2019s screen and stores them directly on the device. It then uses AI to process the data and make it searchable. For example, if someone previously searched for a green dress or the name of a local ice cream shop, they can ask the feature to \u201crecall\u201d anything in their history that was shown on screen. Although so-called semantic search is a big step forward for AI, it comes at a time when the industry is moving so quickly and government regulators, companies and consumers are still figuring out how to use the technology responsibly. Jen Golbeck \u2013 a professor of AI at the University of Maryland who focuses on privacy\u00a0\u2013 said the recall feature could pose a potential \u201cnightmare\u201d if the device falls into the wrong hands. \u201cStuff may stay on your device, but that doesn\u2019t mean people can\u2019t get to it,\u201d she said. \u201cYou won\u2019t have an option to protect yourself even if you use incognito mode or clear your history because the tool has access to everything that\u2019s been on your screen.\u201d The UK\u2019s independent regulator for Data Protection and Freedom of Information, the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO), told CNN it is investigating the tool \u201cto understand the safeguards in place to protect user privacy.\u201d \u201cWe expect organisations to be transparent with users about how their data is being used and only process personal data to the extent that it is necessary to achieve a specific purpose,\u201d the ICO said in a statement. Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment. CEO Satya Nadella told The Wall Street Journal in an interview ahead of Monday\u2019s launch that web searches must only be done on Microsoft\u2019s Edge web browser and that the screenshots never leave the user\u2019s computer. \u201cYou have to put two things together: This is my computer and this is my Recall \u2013 and it\u2019s all being done locally,\u201d he said. Geoff Blaber, CEO of market research firm CCS Insight, said that makes the issue less concerning. \u201cThe backlash by some to this feature isn\u2019t surprising, but it\u2019s an overreaction given that the data stays exclusively on the device and the user has full control,\u201d Blaber said. Someone can decide whether to turn the feature on during the device setup process and can customize and blacklist which apps and websites Recall can access. \u201cThese controls suggest the feature has been built with security and privacy at its core,\u201d he said. \u201cRecall won\u2019t appeal to everyone but the utility provided is likely to be significant.\u201d Potential for malicious uses But Golbeck cited times when that protection might not be enough, such as a journalist in a hostile country, a person trying to get out of an abusive relationship, someone searching for sensitive medical information or an employee whose boss wants to track them. She believes issues around the tool will likely impact the workplace the most. \u201cWe know jobs monitor what we\u2019re doing on their devices, but a lot of people will do a personal thing on their work computer and all of that will be archived and visible to an IT department, even if it just stays on device,\u201d she added. Golbeck said technology, despite the benefits, is too often developed without the consideration of malicious uses. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen over the last 15 years is every single one of those potential malicious use cases comes to fruition in some way or another,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople will want to use this cool feature without understanding the privacy risk \u2013 that there will be a permanent record of everything you do.\u201d Similar reactions to features such as biometric passwords, such as fingerprints, facial recognition and iris scans, have emerged in the past. Blaber said to overcome some of the initial concerns, Microsoft and its partners will need to prove the value, security and privacy of the product in the real world. Still, Michela Menting, a senior research director at ABI Research, believes the feature is a \u201cstep backwards\u201d for privacy. \u201cThe argument that hackers need physical access to even be able to manipulate Recall is short-sighted at best because there are plenty of highly ingenious ways threat actors could exploit such a valuable tool,\u201d she said. \u201cAll it takes is time and effort to find a way.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/tech/microsoft-ai-tool-privacy-recall/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "world"}}

An explosion. But as the\u00a010-year-old\u00a0younger son of Larisa and Mykola Glushko staggered in the dark,\u00a0toward\u00a0his mother\u2019s room, he\u00a0realized\u00a0he was awake, and that his mother lay before him, crushed beneath a collapsed concrete baton. \u201cSomething\u00a0fell,\u201d\u00a0he recalled.\u00a0\u201cMom\u00a0was saying, \u2018Kolya, Kolya.\u2019 I\u00a0shouted,\u00a0\u2018Mom, I\u2019m alive.\u2019\u201d He said he frantically scraped the dust from his face and eyes. \u201cI saw my\u00a0Mom crushed down by the ceiling. I tried to pull it\u00a0away,\u00a0but I couldn\u2019t.\u00a0Mom was moaning and shaking her legs. And I was\u00a0shouting,\u00a0\u2018Mother, mother, it\u2019s just a dream, a horrible dream.\u2019\u201d Mykola had a similar nightmare days earlier, and felt it might be recurring. \u201cThen there was darkness.\u201d His mother died in front of him. His father was killed by the initial explosion. Hours earlier, the family had a barbecue, and Mykola senior drank one beer too many and talked passionately about enlisting. In the pitch black, his son clambered outside, the front of their comfortable family home beyond recognition, its gates torn clean away. Mykola said: \u201cI was\u00a0screaming,\u00a0\u2018God, why did you do this to\u00a0me?\u2019\u00a0I was running in underwear asking for help.\u201d For Mykola, the act of survival stretches what any\u00a010-year-old\u00a0could be expected to\u00a0bear. His\u00a0loss,\u00a0part of a patina of suffering across Ukraine\u2019s two years of war, where Russian missiles that slammed inexplicably into civilian targets, claim lives that do not make the headlines, and unravel childhoods in ways that will echo for decades in Ukraine. Mykola was given a shot\u00a0of medicine\u00a0to calm him in\u00a0hospital,\u00a0and his brother came to explain what had happened. \u201cHe told me now it\u2019s only me and him left. He repeated it four times. I was trying to calm myself down, but also hated myself. Because I couldn\u2019t save my mom.\u201d He\u00a0has spoken\u00a0with his new guardian, his godmother,\u00a0who lives\u00a0nearby,\u00a0and is\u00a0clear he will stay\u00a0in the military town of Pokrovsk to tend their graves. \u201cI will visit them,\u201d he said. \u201c(I will)\u00a0apologize for not able to save them. Will apologize to my father that I couldn\u2019t save my mom, his wife.\u201d He\u00a0said\u00a0his dream now is\u00a0different, to ask his\u00a0parents\u00a0important questions.\u00a0\u201cWhat should I do now? How do I live? Another dream is to take revenge on the one who launched the missile.\u201d Across the\u00a0eastern frontline, notably\u00a0around Pokrovsk, the\u00a0pace of Russia\u2019s advance appears to quicken, and with it the unspeakable loss of families like Mykola\u2019s. At the ruins of his home,\u00a0neighbors\u00a0said\u00a0there is no military target nearby. Workers\u00a0sifted\u00a0through the dust. The smell of the decaying family dog lingered. On a nearby radio, Russians are so close their\u00a0stations\u00a0were\u00a0audible, explaining to their audience how the West refuses to give Ukraine modern equipment and so \u201cthe ordinary boys from Ukrainian armed forces will be the ones to suck it up.\u201d A short drive away, at a\u00a0stabilization\u00a0point in an\u00a0eastern town, the life-changing hideousness of even light injuries\u00a0wasapparent. Sunset means frontline units can begin the task of evacuating their wounded, safe from the Russian attack drones that haunt daylight hours. The medical point\u00a0waited\u00a0in complete darkness, and a car\u00a0raced\u00a0out from the night. Two wounded soldiers from\u00a0Klishchiivka\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a town where Moscow has recently claimed success, partially owing to Ukraine having to relocate forces from there to defend against the onslaught in Kharkiv region\u00a0\u2013\u00a0emerged\u00a0from the car. One has his head fully bandaged up and talked,\u00a0his arms outstretched,\u00a0as\u00a0groped\u00a0his way\u00a0forward. The other\u00a0was laid\u00a0flat on a gurney. They\u00a0were\u00a0quickly tended to. Clothes\u00a0were\u00a0gently cut away. One had\u00a0damage to his eyes, swollen shut, yet appearedotherwise less badly hurt. The other had\u00a0shrapnel in his leg, flesh injuries to his arm, and\u00a0was\u00a0peppered with shrapnel on his back. His face\u00a0was\u00a0covered with dirt and his eyes also struggled\u00a0to open. A mortar landed about\u00a0four\u00a0feet\u00a0(1.2 meters)\u00a0from their dugout. It is a matter of luck and a few feet that they are still physically intact. The staff swiftly tried\u00a0to clean their eyes. \u201cWhen I open the eye like this, do you see the light?\u201d a\u00a0doctor asked. \u201cWhat about people?\u201d The patient could\u00a0only see light. A nurse noticed\u00a0damage to his right hand. They examined\u00a0his back and saw\u00a0a morass of tiny wounds. Suddenly, the patient worsened. \u201cSomething on my\u00a0side,\u201d\u00a0he screamed. It is possible the force of the blast caused internal injuries. The doctors moved\u00a0to quickly intervene. Anaesthetic\u00a0was\u00a0injected into his lung, and a tube inserted. \u201cCough, and it will get better,\u201d a doctor\u00a0told\u00a0the patient. Around the pair, there\u00a0were\u00a0four empty beds. A year ago, one doctor, Ivan, told\u00a0us, they could have 250 patients a day, when the Russian assault on Bakhmut was at its peak. Yet the drop in patients does not herald an improvement in Ukraine\u2019s war. The 93rd mechanized brigade lacks infantry, and finds it hard to resupply and position them on the frontline because of the threat of Russian drones, an official\u00a0told\u00a0us, and so this stabilization unit lacks patients. It is a chilling reminder of the manpower shortage Kyiv is dealing with after two years of war. The patients\u00a0were\u00a0led to a waiting ambulance, which\u00a0left\u00a0in the pitch black, its headlights off.

{"id": "2024_05_28_china_hong-kong-security-arrests-hnk-intl", "text": "Hong Kong police have made their first arrests under a newly passed local national security law over social media posts deemed \u201cseditious\u201d by authorities, just days ahead of the 35th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre. The city\u2019s national security police on Tuesday arrested six people on suspicion of committing acts with seditious intent, according to a police statement. Security chief\u00a0Chris Tang confirmed one of those arrested was Chow Hang-tung, a leading organizer of the huge Tiananmen vigils that used to be held in Hong Kong but are now effectively outlawed. Chow is already in custody on charges related to her democracy activism. In their statement, police accused an unnamed woman in custody and five others of taking advantage of \u201can approaching sensitive date\u201d to anonymously publish seditious posts on social media since April. The goal, police alleged, was to \u201cincite citizens\u2019 hatred of the central authorities, the city government and the judiciary, and to incite netizens to organize or participate in illegal activities later on.\u201d The statement did not state the upcoming sensitive date. However next Tuesday marks the anniversary of Beijing\u2019s June 4, 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, an event that has been scrubbed from the record by Chinese authorities and can no longer be safely commemorated in Hong Kong. Chow, a lawyer and one of the city\u2019s most prominent pro-democracy activists, was previously twice jailed for holding unauthorized vigils to commemorate Beijing\u2019s bloody military crackdown. She is currently in custody on a national security charge. Tang was asked by reporters if the authorities were referring to the June 4 commemoration in the statement announcing the latest arrests. \u201cThe date itself is not important,\u201d he replied. \u201cThe most important thing is that people who want to endanger national security use these topics to incite citizens\u2019 hatred against the Central government, our government and our judiciary.\u201d Those arrested were five women and a man, aged between 37 and 65, police said, adding they could face up to 7 years in prison if convicted. Police raided the homes of five of the suspects and seized items including electronic devices that officers suspect were used to publish the \u201cseditious messages,\u201d according to the statement. \u201cThose who intend to endanger national security should not have the delusion that they can avoid police investigation by going anonymous online,\u201d the statement added. The arrests marked the first time Hong Kong\u2019s own national security law\u00a0had been invoked since it was unanimously passed by the city\u2019s opposition-free legislature in March. Locally known as Article 23, the\u00a0law\u00a0was rushed through at the request of city leader John Lee\u00a0and debated over just 11 days. The legislation introduces 39 new national security crimes, adding to an already powerful national security law that was directly imposed by Beijing on Hong Kong in 2020 after huge and sometimes violent pro-democracy protests the year before. That law has already transformed\u00a0Hong Kong with authorities jailing dozens of political opponents, forcing civil society groups and outspoken media outlets to disband and transforming the once freewheeling city into one that prioritizes patriotism. The local national security legislation covers a raft of new crimes including treason, espionage, external interference and unlawful handling of state secrets, with the most serious offenses punishable by up to life imprisonment. Lee, Hong Kong\u2019s leader, described it as a \u201chistoric moment for Hong Kong,\u201d but critics and analysts warned it would align the financial hub\u2019s national security laws more closely with those used on the Chinese mainland and deepen\u00a0an ongoing crackdown on dissent. For decades, Hong Kong had been the only place on Chinese soil where mass commemorations were held on every June 4 to commemorate the pro-democracy protesters killed by Chinese troops in 1989. The vigils were held by the now-disbanded organization Hong Kong Alliance, of which Chow was a leading figure within. But the candlelight vigils had been all but banned since 2020, as authorities sought to snuff out all public commemorations of the crackdown, which remains the biggest political taboo in mainland China. In 2020 and 2021, Hong Kong authorities banned the event on\u00a0Covid-19\u00a0restrictions grounds, but small crowds continued to show up and light candles. Chow was sentenced to 15 months in prison in 2022 for her part in organizing an unauthorized vigil to commemorate the Tiananmen Square massacre the year before. At the time, she was already serving a 12-month sentence for her role in organizing the 2020 Tiananmen vigil. In a separate case, Chow was charged in 2021 with inciting subversion of state power over her role in Hong Kong Alliance.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/china/hong-kong-security-arrests-hnk-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_28_style_wu-tang-clan-album-museum-australia-intl-hnk", "text": "\u201cOnce Upon a Time in Shaolin\u201d is as mysterious as its title. Recorded by legendary hip-hop group Wu-Tang Clan in secret over six years, only one physical copy of the album was ever made and just a handful of people have heard it in full. Now a few lucky members of the public will be able to listen to it \u2013 if they can get to a museum next month on the Australian island of Tasmania. The rare piece of hip-hop history is set to go on display at the Museum of Old and New Art (Mona) from June 15 to 24, according to the museum. The album will be part of an exhibit that lasts a little over a week with a limited number of free tickets available for curated private listening sessions. It is part of the museum\u2019s \u201cNamedropping\u201d exhibition which explores the rare objects which \u201cpossesses mystical properties that transcend its material circumstances,\u201d said Jarrod Rawlins, director of curatorial affairs at Mona. \u201c\u2019Once Upon a Time in Shaolin\u2019 is more than just an album, so when I was thinking about status, and what a transcendent namedrop could be, I knew I had to get it into this exhibition,\u201d Rawlins said in a statement. The album itself is bound by a legal agreement which states it cannot be commercially exploited until 2103, although it can be played at private listening parties, according to the museum. Wu-Tang Clan first announced in March 2014 that it would produce one copy of \u201cOnce Upon a Time in Shaolin\u201d to be sold to the highest bidder. The album came in a hand-carved box with a leather-bound book of parchment paper containing lyrics and its backstory. By\u00a0releasing\u00a0only one copy of the album, the group wanted to \u201cput out a piece of art like nobody else has done in the history of [modern] music,\u201d Wu-Tang member Robert \u201cRZA\u201d Diggs\u00a0told Forbes in 2014. The album was also created in protest of the devaluation of music as an artform in the digital age, RZA said in the interview. Since then, the album has had a history almost as unusual as its release. In 2015, notorious \u201cPharma Bro\u201d Martin Shkreli bagged the album for about $2 million \u2013 making it the world\u2019s most expensive music album ever sold at the time. But US federal authorities seized it from Shkreli, who was eventually\u00a0convicted\u00a0 of securities fraud and conspiracy in 2017 for defrauding investors out of more than $10 million between 2009 and 2014. Before his conviction, which was related to his time as CEO of biotech company Retrophin, Shkreli was dubbed \u201cthe most hated man in America\u201d in 2015 while serving as CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals after he increased the price of a drug used by AIDS patients from $13.50 to $750 per pill. In 2021, the US Justice Department then sold the album without disclosing the buyer. At the time the DoJ said the money from the album\u2019s sale would go toward the remaining balance owed on the approximately $7.4 million forfeiture order entered against Shkreli at his March 2018 sentencing. Digital art collective PleasrDAO, who describe themselves as a \u201cdecentralized autonomous organization\u201d and an early adopter of NFT digital art, later confirmed in a\u00a0 video the same year that they\u00a0bought the album using cryptocurrency. While PleasrDAO did not disclose how much it spent to acquire the album, the The New York Times reported it exchanged hands for the equivalent of $4 million.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/style/wu-tang-clan-album-museum-australia-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "world"}}

Gauff, who won her first grand slam title at last year\u2019s US Open, reached the final at Roland Garros in 2022 and is looking to go one better at this year\u2019s tournament. The 20-year-old was dominant against Avdeeva, dropping just two games \u2013 one at the start of each set \u2013 and winning 23 out of 24 points on her first serve. \u201cIt was a good day for me,\u201d she said in her on-court interview. \u201cShe played well today, I think I was just the better player.\u201d The victory was Gauff\u2019s 50th in the main draw of a grand slam, while Andeeva, by contrast, was playing in the main draw of a major for the first time. Next up for the American is Czech qualifier Tamara Zidan\u0161ek, who reached the semifinals of the French Open three years ago \u2013 by far her best-ever run at a grand slam. Speaking to the Tennis Channel after her fifth first-round win at Roland Garros, Gauff reflected on some of the long-term goals for her career. \u201cI just want to win as many slams as possible,\u201d she said. \u201cBeing inspired by Serena Williams \u2013 she\u2019s the one and true and only GOAT \u2013 but I think being inspired by her, it allowed me to make my dreams as limitless as possible. \u201cI was taught from a young age to make your dreams as big as possible, even if they don\u2019t feel realistic.\u201d Elsewhere in the women\u2019s draw, defending champion Iga \u015awi\u0105tek defeated French qualifier Leolia Jeanjean 6-1 6-2 to set up a blockbuster second-round clash against fellow four-time grand slam winner Naomi Osaka. \u015awi\u0105tek, like Gauff, wasted little time in her opening match, requiring just over an hour to wrap up her 15th consecutive victory at Roland Garros. The 22-year-old \u015awi\u0105tek is the first women\u2019s player to reach that milestone since Justine Henin won 24 matches and three-straight titles between 2005 and 2010 \u2013 the latter a feat that the Polish star is trying to replicate this year. The world No. 1 is also unbeaten since April having won in Rome and Madrid ahead of this year\u2019s French Open. She now has an unusually difficult second-round match against Osaka, who has returned to tennis this year having become a mother. \u201cShe\u2019s a great person and her game style is pretty fun to watch as well,\u201d \u015awi\u0105tek told reporters about facing the Japanese star. \u201cI haven\u2019t actually played against Naomi on clay, so we\u2019ll see how that\u2019s going to go. \u201cWe need to prepare tactically for sure, but all these matches that we played on hard court were always really intense and tough. I\u2019m just glad that she came back and she\u2019s playing more tournaments even than before the break.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/sport/coco-gauff-french-open-first-round-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "world"}}

The Cessna plane lost power during the flight on Sunday, forcing the pilot to make a mayday call to report an engine problem and glide its way back home, CNN affiliate Nine News reported. Footage from Nine News showed the plane coming dangerously close to trees and buildings as the pilot steered the stricken aircraft towards Bankstown Airport in Sydney\u2019s southwest. \u201cIt was gliding, there was no power,\u201d pilot Jake Swanepoel told Nine News. \u201cWe clipped the trees, and we just made it over the hanger.\u201d Swanepoel managed to land the plane on an airport taxiway, where it skidded to a stop on its belly.

{"id": "2024_05_28_style_netflix-docuseries-7m-tiktok-culture-queue", "text": "Over two years ago, a 40-minute-long public plea made on Instagram Live rippled across social media. In the video, TikTok dancer Melanie Wilking and her parents claimed they had lost all contact with her 25-year-old sister, Miranda \u2014 now, Miranda Derrick \u2014 to a \u201creligious organization\u201d and that she was \u201cno longer in control\u201d of her life. Melanie and Miranda had performed together as the Wilking Sisters, but the family said Derrick had disappeared from their lives. She was still living in the public eye, however, including announcing a marriage to fellow dancer James Derrick (known as BDash). Until then, it\u2019s unlikely that Derrick\u2019s millions of followers would have noticed anything amiss, based on her social media accounts. The Los Angeles-based dancer was regularly posting feel-good, polished videos of modern choreography to throwbacks hits with BDash and a small-knit group of fellow dancers and creators. She had walked the red carpet at the American Music Awards in November 2021, and just days before her family shared their video message, appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show. But in the time since, reports from multiple publications, including The Cut and Rolling Stone, as well as an ongoing lawsuit, and now, a Netflix documentary, have revealed troubling claims about the mysterious religious organization the Derricks joined, and how it allegedly doubles as a talent management company called 7M Films. In the new three-part docuseries \u201cDancing for the Devil: The 7M TikTok Cult,\u201d the Wilking family is joined by a handful of dancers formerly represented by 7M Films \u2014 who are in civil litigation with its co-owner and CEO, Robert Shinn \u2014 to speak up about their experiences. They include Kevin \u201cKonkrete\u201d Davis, who rose to fame in the dance community alongside BDash, Aubrey Fisher and Kylie Douglas. Davis, Fisher and Douglas collaborated with the Derricks regularly on dance videos during their time with 7M and had amassed millions of combined followers across TikTok and Instagram. Shinn, an LA pastor \u2014 whose son, Isaiah Shinn, films the Derricks\u2019 content \u2014 founded 7M alongside his long-running Shekinah Church; \u201cDancing for the Devil\u201d asserts the two entities are one and the same, with Shinn and his wife, Hannah, enriching themselves from their church members and talent while isolating them from their previous lives. (7M Films made a public statement in 2022 asserting that it is \u201coperate(d) separately and apart\u201d from Shekinah Church.) According to the series, which also features former members of the church, Shinn first began Shekinah as a religious community for Korean Americans, then founded 7M as an off-shoot business for Internet-famous dancers, promising them fame and wealth in addition to religious salvation. First-hand accounts and recordings of Shinn\u2019s sermons detail how he asked members to \u201cdie to\u201d their families, or cut them off, in order to save their loved ones in the afterlife. Wilking, too, had attended dinners hosted by Shinn along with her sister, but, sensing red flags, she declined to go to his invite-only church services, she explained in the series. \u201cIt was an opportunity to tell a story in real time \u2014 an active story that was still unfolding in front of our eyes,\u201d said the docuseries\u2019 director, Derek Doneen, in a video interview with CNN. \u201cBefore we started shooting, the (featured) dancers were still in (the organization).\u201d Many of the people who became subjects in the show were people that we didn\u2019t ever really know if we\u2019d get the opportunity to meet and talk to and feature.\u201d Twin stories, broken families \u201cDancing for the Devil\u201d largely follows the parallel stories of two pairs of sisters who were allegedly separated by Shinn\u2019s organizations: Wilking and Derrick, and Melanie and Priscylla Lee. The latter two joined Shekinah as young immigrants in 1999 and became dependent on it for housing and work (Priscylla has since changed her last name to Leigh). They lost contact for years when Melanie left the church \u2014 with the help of a friend\u00a0 \u2014 and Priscylla stayed. \u201cFor (Melanie Lee) to come forward \u2014 I\u2019m just so appreciative of her strength and trust in us,\u201d said the documentary\u2019s executive producer Jessica Acevedo, explaining that she was initially wary. \u201cShe expressed that she has her sister still in there, and (she) feared for her.\u201d Over the course of production, Priscylla left Shekinah, too, and shared her story. The Shinn family and the Derricks did not participate in the docuseries, though Miranda has stated on social media that she is \u201cnot in a cult.\u201d BDash described 7M as a \u201csecular for profit company run by people who have faith in God,\u201d in his own statement. \u201cIt is their job to manage/control our bookings or schedules\u2026 That is not a cult activity, it\u2019s called doing business.\u201d \u201cIs it wrong for Christians to be involved in a non faith based entertainment business?\u201d he continued. \u201cIf 7M was run by (an) unbeliever, then is it no longer a cult?\u201d The Derricks and a lawyer for Robert and Hannah Shinn did not return CNN\u2019s request for comment. The Derricks have also previously refuted claims that she is being kept from her family, framing the situation instead as a personal family dispute. In 2022, a lawyer for 7M Films told Rolling Stone: \u201cIt is pathetic and contemptible to try to turn her (Miranda\u2019s) private family matters into a tawdry public scandal for clicks and clout.\u201d In 2022, Shinn filed a lawsuit claiming defamation and trade libel against several former church members, including the Lee sisters, that alleges the defendants made \u201cfalse statements\u201d referring to Shinn\u2019s organizations as a cult, and launched a campaign to \u201ccancel\u201d Shinn \u201cthrough flagrant, defamatory attacks on social and other media.\u201d The following year, Davis, Fisher and Douglas, among others, joined a cross-complaint with the former church members against Shinn, his wife, their entities and other affiliated individuals. The claims accuse them of fraud, forced labor and human trafficking, as well as Robert of sexual battery. The case is scheduled to go to trial in July 2025 in Los Angeles; to date, no criminal charges have been filed. Today, Derrick is back in contact with her family, occasionally documenting their holidays together on her social media accounts \u2014 though the docuseries alleges this is mostly for optics, and that she is still close to Shinn. Derrick did not return CNN\u2019s request for comment about this allegation. For members who do leave Shinn\u2019s organizations, the documentary makers learned it\u2019s not an easy path, as they follow Priscylla\u2019s struggle to adapt to a new life outside of the church and her pursuit of justice. \u201cYou don\u2019t come out healed; you don\u2019t come out necessarily disavowing many of the teachings,\u201d Doneen said. \u201cThat was a bit of a learning curve for me to understand. Once you\u2019re out, it is day one of a very long journey \u2014 a very long road to recovery.\u201d \u201cDancing for the Devil: The 7M TikTok Cult\u201d is available on Netflix on May 29.

{"id": "2024_05_22_middleeast_palestinian-statehood-spain-norway-ireland-intl", "text": "Ireland, Spain and Norway have announced plans to formally recognize a Palestinian state next week, in a move that is likely to bolster the global Palestinian cause but further strain relations between Europe and Israel. The three European nations say their landmark decision is the best way to achieve lasting peace in the Middle East, but it sparked swift condemnation from Israel, as its foreign minister ordered the immediate recall of its ambassadors from those countries. Most of the world already recognizes Palestinian statehood. More than 140 out of 193 member states of the United Nations have made their recognition official. But only some nations in the 27-member European Union are among them. Irish Prime Minister Simon Harris told a Wednesday news conference in Dublin: \u201cToday, Ireland, Norway and Spain are announcing that we recognize the state of Palestine. Each of us will now undertake whatever national steps are necessary to give effect to that decision.\u201d \u201cThere is never a wrong time to do the right thing,\u201d Harris later said, speaking to CNN\u2019s Christiana Amanpour on Thursday. \u201cIt was my government\u2019s preferred position to recognize a two-state solution as part of a peace process to bring that about, but sadly, unfortunately, such a comprehensive peace settlement now seems, in many ways, further away than it has ever been,\u201d Harris said. \u201cWe believe you can\u2019t say you\u2019re in favor of a two-state solution and not recognize the very existence of two states,\u201d he added. The recognition will come into force in all three countries on May 28, according to Irish Foreign Minister Miche\u00e1l Martin. Norway\u2019s\u00a0Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re said that a Palestinian state was \u201ca prerequisite for achieving peace in the Middle East.\u201d \u201cThere will be no peace in the Middle East without a two-state solution,\u201d St\u00f8re said in a statement. \u201cThere can be no two-state solution without a Palestinian state.\u201d Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez sought to characterize the decision as one that was not anti-Israel. \u201cThis recognition is not against the people of Israel and certainly not against the Jewish people,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not in favor of Hamas. It\u2019s in favor of co-existence.\u201d The announcement was welcomed by Palestinian officials. \u201cThis step reflects Spain\u2019s keenness to support the Palestinian people and their inalienable and legitimate rights to their land and homeland,\u201d the office of the president of the Palestinian Authority said in response to Madrid\u2019s decision, as reported by Palestinian news agency Wafa. Hamas, the militant group which governs Gaza, urged other countries to follow suit and \u201crecognize our legitimate national rights, support the struggle of our people for liberation and independence, and end the Zionist occupation of our land.\u201d But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said recognizing a Palestinian state would be a \u201creward for terror.\u201d \u201cThis will be a terror state, which will attempt to perpetrate the onslaught of October 7 time and again, and to that we shall not agree,\u201d Netanyahu said, adding, \u201cthis evil must not be given a state.\u201d As Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz ordered the immediate recall of its ambassadors to Spain, Norway and Ireland, he said, in a statement: \u201cI am sending a clear message today \u2014 Israel will not hold back against those who undermine its sovereignty and endanger its security.\u201d \u201cAfter the terrorist organization Hamas carried out the largest massacre of Jews since the Holocaust, after it committed the most horrific sex crimes the world has seen, these countries chose to give a reward to Hamas and Iran and recognize a Palestinian state,\u201d Katz added. Israel launched its military offensive in Gaza\u00a0on October 7\u00a0after militants led by Hamas killed at least 1,200 people and abducted more than 250 others. Israel has come under fierce criticism for its war. Earlier this month, a panel of independent UN experts condemned \u201cthe continued and systematic onslaught of violence committed against Palestinians in Gaza.\u201d The agency has repeatedly called for a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of hostages taken by Hamas. Israeli attacks\u00a0in\u00a0Gaza have since killed at least\u00a035,647\u00a0Palestinians and injured another\u00a079,852\u00a0people, according to the Ministry of Health there. CNN cannot independently confirm the figures. Two-state solution All three European leaders stressed the importance of having Palestinian statehood in reaching a two-state solution in the Middle East, a decades-long goal that the international community has failed to achieve. Ireland\u2019s Foreign Minister Martin said the decision came amid \u201cgrowing impatience\u201d with Israel\u2019s lack of political will for a two-state solution. \u201cThe integrity of that two-state solution has been undermined in recent years by the strategy of the Israeli government and, in particular, the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has declared opposition to it,\u201d Martin told CNN\u2019s Richard Quest during a live interview. Meanwhile, Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide told CNN\u2019s Becky Anderson that Israel was wrong to see recognizing Palestinian statehood as rewarding Hamas. \u201cWe are sending the opposite signal. We are supporting the Palestine authorities which spring out of the PLO [Palestine Liberation Organization] who renounce violence and who many decades ago promised to leave the violent struggle behind and work for peaceful settlement with Israel \u2014 a promise they have kept by the way,\u201d Eide said. Senior officials in the United States, a close ally of Israel, have insisted the only way to bring peace and stability to the region is through the creation of a Palestinian state with guarantees for Israel\u2019s security. Lawmakers in Israel have long rejected those calls. Reacting to the news on Wednesday, a National Security Council spokesperson told CNN that US President Joe Biden \u201cis a strong supporter\u201d of a two-state solution. The spokesperson added, however: \u201cHe believes a Palestinian state should be realized through direct negotiations between the parties, not through unilateral recognition.\u201d France, meanwhile, said that now is not the \u201cright time\u201d for it to join its European neighbors in recognizing a Palestinian state. The country\u2019s foreign minister, Stephane S\u00e9journe, added that such a decision is not merely a \u201csymbolic issue or a question of political positioning\u201d but rather a \u201cdiplomatic tool\u201d in the service of a two-state solution. Germany, another one of Israel\u2019s staunchest allies, also questioned the decision. Michael Roth, the chair of the parliament\u2019s\u00a0Foreign Affairs Committee, posted on X: \u201cI\u2019m not convinced that the recognition of Palestine as a sovereign state is an appropriate measure after the horrific massacres (by) Hamas (on) October 7 last year.\u201d Qatar, a key mediator in stalled ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas, said it hopes \u201cfor more countries to recognize the State of Palestine,\u201d according to a statement from the foreign ministry. The foreign ministry of Saudi Arabia, another regional actor, called on \u201cmore countries to swiftly take the same stance.\u201d Ireland has a long history of being openly supportive of the Palestinian cause, consistently criticizing Israeli policies in the occupied West Bank and Gaza before Hamas\u2019 October 7 attack in Israel. Since then, Israel\u2019s war in response has shredded huge parts of the Gaza Strip and drained critical supplies, exposing the entire population of more than 2.2 million people to the risk of famine. \u201cI can say this to the people of Israel: we recognize the state of Israel. We recognize the state of Israel\u2019s right to live in peace and security. That is their right. The people of Palestine also must have an equivalent right to peace and security,\u201d Harris told Amanpour on Thursday. \u201cAnd let me also say this to the people of Israel: the Irish people know what it\u2019s like to have their national identity hijacked by a terrorist organization. The IRA was never the people of Ireland and Hamas is not the people of Palestine.\u201d \u201cWe have been clear and unequivocal that we condemn Hamas, that we condemn the most horrific barbaric massacre that Israel experienced on the 7th\u00a0of October. We call for the unconditional and immediate release of all hostages. But it is entirely possible to say what I have just said and also say the next bit which sadly some refuse to say: that what is happening in Palestine, what is happening in Gaza is a humanitarian catastrophe, that children are being starved, are being deprived of food and that there are children who will go to sleep in Gaza tonight not sure if they will wake in the morning,\u201d he added. A source familiar with the matter told CNN the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs is currently considering further diplomatic steps against the three countries. Steps under consideration include cancelling visits of officials from these countries to Israel and revoking visas from diplomats, which will limit their ability to visit areas in the West Bank under control of the Palestinian Authority, the source said. Another step under consideration by Israel is to reach out to the US to seek diplomatic support in providing clarification from Norway, Ireland and Spain on their intended decision, and to ask the US to try and convince other countries to not follow suit. Pressure on Israel The planned recognition adds pressure on Israel after seven months of fighting, according to H.A. Hellyer, scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the Royal United Services Institute for Defence and Security Studies in London. \u201cFor individual Palestinians on the ground in the Occupied Territories, it\u2019s not going to mean anything at all in the short term, perhaps in the medium term,\u201d Hellyer told CNN. \u201cIt is obviously political recognition by states that don\u2019t have a presence on the ground.\u201d Hellyer added that Israel risks becoming an \u201cinternational pariah\u201d given that Western nations are now beginning to recognize a Palestinian state.  Israel captured Gaza from Egypt in the 1967 war, then withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005. The territory, home to some 2 million Palestinians, fell under Hamas\u2019 rule in 2007. After Hamas took control, Israel and Egypt imposed a strict siege on the territory, which is ongoing. Israel also maintains an air and naval blockade on Gaza. These severe restrictions have been fiercely criticized by international bodies, including Amnesty International,\u00a0who say\u00a0Israel has violated international law. The vast majority of the population in Gaza are descendants of 700,000 Palestinians who fled or were\u00a0forcibly expelled\u00a0from their homes during what Palestinians call\u00a0al-Nakba, or \u201cthe catastrophe,\u201d of the 1948-49 war, in what is now Israel.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/middleeast/palestinian-statehood-spain-norway-ireland-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_28_travel_bolivia-cuisine-top-restaurants-dishes", "text": "Bolivia doesn\u2019t seem like an obvious foodie destination. But the big, landlocked South American country is making waves in the culinary world via top-notch restaurants and transforming foodways pioneered by the ancient Inca and Aymara peoples into modern fusion dishes. Capital city La Paz boasts three eateries \u2014 Gustu, Ancestral and Phayawi \u2014 currently ranked among the top 100 restaurants in Latin America. And more are waiting in the wings. And it\u2019s not just La Paz. Bolivia\u2019s food revolution has also spread to major cities such as Sucre as well as the Uyuni Salt Flats. The new Bolivian cuisine kicked off about a decade ago, according to Marsia Taha, head chef at Gustu. \u201cThere was a generation of new chefs that had a mindset that we should be proud about our identity and our culture and our food,\u201d Taha said. Taha and other likeminded chefs in La Paz coalesced around the concept of \u201czero-kilometer cuisine\u201d \u2014 using as many ingredients as possible that are raised or grown locally and having direct contact with the ranchers or farmers that provide those things. \u201cBy showing that we believe in local products, we were able to show people that Bolivian cuisine could be as great as things coming from outside the country,\u201d adds Sebasti\u00e1n Gim\u00e9nez, chef and co-owner of Ancestral. Revolutionizing Bolivian cuisine It\u2019s not surprising that Gustu has been counted among the continent\u2019s elite dining destinations since first opening its doors in 2013. Co-founder Claus Meyer is a Danish culinary legend who helped pioneer the New Nordic food movement at the Michelin three-star Noma restaurant in Copenhagen, and Gustu is always mentioned among the continent\u2019s top restaurants. Merging Bolivia\u2019s traditional ingredients and food culture with the contemporary Nordic model, Taha and Meyer fashioned a gastronomic melting pot that truly lives up to its name (gustu means \u201cdelicious\u201d in the Quechua language of the Andes). Among the signature dishes are raw Lake Titicaca trout with mango; llama with Amazonian vanilla and ajipa root; Amazon fish with goldenberries and a fermented yuca (cassava); and an out-of-this-world lamb tamale. Taha says that even after a decade in business, she and Gustu\u2019s other chefs are able to keep the concept fresh by traveling around Bolivia to learn about new ingredients and foodways. \u201cLearning how people cook, how they grow their food, and so on. We also give a lot of liberty to our chefs to bring in new ideas.\u201d Variations on the theme Located in the trendy Achumani neighborhood on the south side of La Paz, Ancestral occupies a cozy basement location with floor-to-ceiling windows looking out on a sunken garden. The food is new Bolivian with Basque and Nordic undertones, but the concept is open fire or parrilla-style cooking that revolves around the wood-stoked grill and oven. \u201cWe\u2019re inspired by the biodiversity of Bolivia,\u201d says chef Sebasti\u00e1n Gim\u00e9nez. \u201cWe have jungle, valleys, altiplano, and very high places. We are also inspired by local products and local techniques. We only use Bolivian products, and we only serve Bolivian wines.\u201d But don\u2019t expect traditional Andean or Amazon dishes. Ancestral offers a delicious fusion of old and new in offerings such as the chulet\u00f3n ribeye steak, trout ceviche with grilled corn and sweet potato, and porchetta pork roast with Bolivian tubers and red aji sauce. Manq\u2019a takes another tack. Rather than fine dining, the ambience is decidedly casual, the tables spread across three floors of an old wooden townhouse in the boho Sopocachi neighborhood of central La Paz. It\u2019s especially busy at lunch, a mixed bag of local shoppers, politicians, students and the occasional tourist savoring dishes such as sopa de man\u00ed (peanut soup), gratinated cheese and native potatoes with humacha sauce, soft baked keper\u00ed beef from eastern Bolivia, and surubi catfish from the Amazon served with quinoa, tucupi cassava and edible flowers. Food of the devil The chefs at these top-shelf restaurants don\u2019t have to look far for basic ingredients. Many of the building blocks of their fusion foods are native to the Andes valleys and foothills that extend all the way along Bolivia\u2019s western side from Lake Titicaca to Argentina. More than 4,000 potato types are cultivated in Bolivia and its Andean neighbors, many of them found in just a single, small valley. They come in various shapes, sizes, colors and slightly different flavors. Even more than spuds, Bolivians cherish their quinoa. The country boasts more than 3,100 varieties of quinoa, which contrary to popular opinion is actually the seed of a flowering pseudocereal plant rather than a true grain. An exhibit at the new visitor center in the silver mining town of San Crist\u00f3bal points out that Spanish conquistadors and padres considered quinoa the \u201cfood of the devil\u201d and banned its consumption as a way to control the local indigenous people. Five centuries later, NASA declared quinoa \u201cthe perfect food to grow in indoor greenhouses\u201d during long voyages in outer space because of its resistance to adverse conditions (such as growing in the Andes), versatility and high protein content. No longer vilified as Satan\u2019s feast, it\u2019s also an ideal ingredient for Bolivia\u2019s new-wave cuisine. Zero-kilometer goes wider Sucre, the nation\u2019s judicial capital in south-central Bolivia, isn\u2019t as cosmopolitan as La Paz when it comes to food. But it\u2019s gradually catching up. Located across the street from the city\u2019s Cathedral Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe, Joy Ride Cafe was founded as a tourist restaurant but evolved into a local hangout for date nights, after-work parties and Sucrense craving burgers, pasta and other global eats. But right down the block is the fusion fare of El Solar. The seven-course degustation menu features dishes such as seafood rice flavored with Amazonian citrus juice, pork belly with pepper sauce and a creamy puree made from plantain and yuca; and beef loin with charque (llama jerky). All of this for 80 bolivianos (roughly $12). Located in southwest Bolivia about 300 miles (500 kilometers) south of La Paz, the otherworldly Salar de Uyuni is the world\u2019s largest and most spectacular salt flat as well as Bolivia\u2019s top tourist attraction. Once upon a time, it was primarily a backpacker destination, but in recent years, more well-heeled travelers (and social media influencers) have sparked a transformation of the local dining scene. Tika restaurant at the Jardines de Uyuni Hotel looks ordinary from the outside, but the kitchen creates Andean-inspired dishes that easily match anything found in Bolivia\u2019s big cities. Chef Tania L\u00f3pez also uses the term \u201czero-kilometer cuisine\u201d to describe the menu at Tika. Among her signature dishes are a sun-dried, shredded llama jerky with local white cheese and a piquant yellow chili pepper sauce, bubbling k\u2019alaphurka corn soup, and lake trout filets in a basil pesto \u201clagoon\u201d with quinoa risotto. L\u00f3pez says one of the closest dishes at Tika to what the ancient Inca may have eaten is the llama potojchi. \u201cPreparation takes more time than beef,\u201d she explains of a succulent dish that resembles goulash. \u201cWe still do this in the traditional way from many centuries ago \u2014 heated on lava rocks.\u201d Dishes that the Incas never tasted \u2014 but would probably die for \u2014 are Tika\u2019s house-made desserts, in particular the quinoa and purple corn ice creams.

The Virginia resident was fined $9,000, Kimo Tynes, the director of communications for the Government of the Turks and Caicos Islands, said in a news statement. Since he had already served three weeks in jail, the court recognized it as time served so his prison sentence is complete, the release said. The 31-year-old American faced as much as a 12-year prison sentence. But the Hon. Justice Davidson Baptiste cited exceptional circumstances in Wenrich\u2019s case and said, \u201cEnforcing the mandatory minimum would have been arbitrary and disproportionate, and would not serve the public interest.\u201d Another American charged with possession of ammunition, Ryan Tyler Watson, pleaded guilty Tuesday, according to Tynes. Watson\u2019s sentencing is scheduled for June 21. In recent months, all were arrested and accused of bringing in various amounts of ammunition to the 40-island chain southeast of the Bahamas. Bringing firearms or ammunition into Turks and Caicos without prior permission from police is \u201cstrictly forbidden,\u201d according to a\u00a0statement\u00a0from its government. In the Turks and Caicos, possession of firearms or ammunition carries a minimum 12-year sentence, though the law allows reduced sentences under \u201cexceptional circumstances.\u201d  Even though the territory doesn\u2019t manufacture firearms or ammunition, the number of firearms finding their way to the islands has increased, Misick said. Meanwhile, the United States has\u00a0more guns than people. On Friday, American Bryan Hagerich of Pennsylvania pleaded guilty and received a 52-week sentence\u00a0suspended for one year\u00a0and a $6,700 fine, his representatives said. He returned to the United States after paying the fine. In addition to Hagerich and Wenrich, one other American \u2013 Michael Lee Evans \u2013 pleaded guilty to possession of ammunition while traveling in Turks and Caicos, according to the territory\u2019s government. Evans was allowed to return to the US over a \u201csevere\u201d medical situation, but will be required to return to Turks and Caicos for his next hearing, attorney Oliver Smith told CNN. The rest remain in Turks and Caicos. A fifth American, Sharitta Shinese Grier, was arrested last week and is awaiting trial after making bail, according to Tynes\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b, with the Office of the Premier and Public Policy. The mandatory minimum 12-year sentence for possession of firearms or ammunition is in place to protect those on the islands, and judges may use their discretion to impose reduced sentences, Turks and Caicos Gov. Dileeni Daniel-Selvaratnam said. US citizens are not being targeted, Turks and Caicos officials said. Of the 195 people sentenced for firearm-related offenses over the past six years, only seven were US citizens, Misick said Thursday. No US citizen has received the 12-year sentence to date.

The blaze was still burning on Wednesday afternoon, more than 24 hours after it began, and authorities and citizens in the Danish capital have started reckoning with the loss of one of the city\u2019s most recognizable landmarks. Local firefighters continued to try to put out the fire, which ripped through\u00a0the building \u2013 known locally as B\u00f8rsen \u2013\u00a0from early Tuesday, reaching all its floors and causing the collapse of a dragon-tail spire that had long been a symbol of the city. The walls of the building are still standing, but the interior has been significantly damaged and the roof is partially collapsed. Firefighters used cranes to hose water down into the building. Copenhagen\u00a0police meanwhile launched an investigation on Wednesday, which they said will be a \u201ccomplicated process.\u201d Police officer Brian Belling said authorities have already \u201cconducted interviews, secured surveillance and carried out a large number of investigative steps.\u201d \u201cBut of course, there is still a lot to do, especially as we have not yet had the opportunity to examine\u00a0B\u00f8rsen itself,\u201d Belling added. The 17th century building exemplified the style of the Dutch Renaissance, and housed a number of artworks, some of which were saved on Tuesday. Residents were stunned by the outbreak, which brought back memories of the fire that tore through the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris exactly five years and a day earlier. \u201cMy first thought was (that) I hope that they rebuild it \u2013 it\u2019s never going to be the same but it\u2019s iconic to\u00a0Copenhagen\u00a0and Denmark,\u201d teacher Eva Simoni Lomholdt, 58, told Reuters. Brian Mikkelsen, the CEO of the Danish Chamber of Commerce which owns the building, told the news agency that a firefighter gave him the top of the spire on Wednesday morning after it was recovered following its fall. \u201cIt gives me hope because we have decided to rebuild the stock exchange because it\u2019s part of European history as a trading continent,\u201d he said. The old stock exchange \u2013 located only a few minutes walk from Christiansborg\u00a0Palace \u2013 dates back to 1625. It was built in the Dutch Renaissance style at the request of King Christian IV and had recently been undergoing renovations with its facade covered in scaffolding and protective coverings. It has been at the heart of Danish business since then; while it no longer houses the Danish stock exchange, it serves as the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce. Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said Tuesday a \u201cpiece of Danish history\u201d was on fire, calling the building \u201cirreplaceable.\u201d Denmark\u2019s culture minister Jakob Engel-Schmidt added that 400 years of cultural heritage had been damaged. \u201cHow touching it is to see how the employees at B\u00f8rsen, good people from the emergency services and passers-by work together to rescue art treasures and iconic images from the burning building,\u201d he said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/17/style/copenhagen-stock-exchange-fire-police-investigation-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "world"}}

The tornado watch covers parts of northern Texas, much of central Oklahoma and south-central Kansas. It will expire at 11 p.m. CT. The watch calls for several tornadoes \u2013 a few intense ones likely \u2013 over an area that includes cities such as Wichita, Kansas, and Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, according to the Storm Prediction Center. This is a special kind of tornado watch issued only when there\u2019s unusually high confidence in the potential of multiple at least EF2-strength and long-lived tornadoes in the area, according to the National Weather Service. Another tornado watch was added to portions of Kansas until 1 a.m. CT, affecting half a million people, according to the Storm Prediction Center. More than 4.5 million Americans were under tornado watches Saturday evening. The supercell thunderstorms firing up in the watch area will also be capable of extremely large hail up to the size of grapefruits and damaging wind gusts to 80 mph. An EF4 tornado \u2013 the third such violent tornado this year \u2013 killed at least four people in Greenfield, Iowa, Tuesday and left parts of the city in ruin. More strong tornadoes \u2013 at least EF2-strength \u2013 are possible Saturday in parts of the Plains and Sunday in portions of the Midwest. Some tornadoes Saturday could be particularly violent and exceed EF4-strength, the Storm Prediction Center warned Friday. Supercell thunderstorms that began firing up Saturday could be capable of producing a couple tornadoes, scattered large hail up to the size of softballs and damaging wind gusts to 70 mph, according to the Storm Prediction Center. Dangerous storms are expected to rumble to life in the evening in parts of western Nebraska, Kansas and Oklahoma. Storms will expand in both scope and strength in the evening and overnight and move east into the Mississippi Valley. A Level 4 of 5 risk of severe thunderstorms is in place Saturday for a large swath of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Oklahoma City, Tulsa and Wichita, and far western Missouri. \u201cViolent tornadoes, extreme hail and corridors of widespread wind damage\u201d are most likely within this area, according to the SPC, but could extend beyond it. Anywhere from Texas through Nebraska to the Mississippi Valley could encounter storms unloading strong wind gusts, hail and tornadoes. Robust thunderstorms will continue over parts of the Mississippi Valley through Sunday morning before gradually losing their strength. But a new round of damaging storms is expected to arrive quickly after. Thunderstorms will develop over portions of the Midwest by Sunday afternoon and develop farther south and east through the evening and overnight hours. Powerful storms could ultimately stretch from the Great Lakes to the South Sunday night. Damaging wind gusts and hail will be the main hazards with any severe thunderstorm Sunday, but some could produce tornadoes. At this time, the greatest tornado threat is in parts of the Midwest, especially during the afternoon and evening. The travel hubs of Chicago, Indianapolis, St. Louis and Nashville could have to contend with damaging storms, leading to delayed or cancelled flights. Thunderstorm activity will likely continue for Memorial Day Monday and could disrupt outdoor plans and travel for a large part of the East. Some of these thunderstorms could become severe, but it\u2019s not yet clear how widespread the threat will be. Even in the absence of damaging wind gusts, hail or tornadoes, lightning is a serious threat for any outdoor plans like picnics, pool parties or beach trips. Unofficial start of summer will officially feel like summer Meanwhile, dangerous storms and searing heat will\u00a0continue affecting vast portions of the United States this Memorial Day weekend and could disrupt outdoor plans and travel. A near-record number of people will travel this weekend in what could be the busiest period in nearly two decades, according to AAA. Travelers will have to contend with a hazardous and disruptive multi-day severe thunderstorm event with damaging winds, dangerous hail and strong tornadoes. It is expected to unfold this weekend in portions of the central, southern and eastern US. Severe weather has been unrelenting in May, but hit an even more\u00a0frenetic pace\u00a0this week. Nearly 850 wind damage reports and at least 80 tornado reports have occurred across the US since Sunday. While severe storms pound inland areas this weekend, some coastal areas will face a different threat. A heaping serving of summerlike heat is on the menu as many head to the beach to celebrate the unofficial start of summer. It\u2019s already been record hot in parts of the South this month, especially in South Texas and South Florida, the type of extreme heat made more likely by human-caused climate change. Record heat will expand over the weekend and jeopardize daily high temperature records in jeopardy from Texas through the Southeast as air temperatures soar well into the 90s. Houston, New Orleans, Miami, Mobile, Alabama, Tampa, Florida, and Charleston, South Carolina, are just a few cities along the Gulf and southeast Atlantic coasts where it\u2019ll feel more like July than late May through Memorial Day. The heat index, which measures what the body actually feels, could approach triple-digits along the southern tier of the US, raising health risks from weather\u2019s deadliest threat. For those out in the heat, it\u2019s important to stay hydrated and be vigilant for signs of heat exhaustion or heat stroke. Heat index values skyrocketed well into the 100s this week in southern Texas and could climb higher into seriously dangerous territory through Monday.

{"id": "2024_04_10_style_graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers", "text": "Climbing up abandoned, unfinished floors and tightrope walking across balcony ledges, backpacks clanging with cans of alkyd and acrylic, a collective of Los Angeles graffiti artists have transformed their craft beyond urban aesthetics to champion community issues. Their choice of canvas: Oceanwide Plaza in Downtown LA. Occupying over a full square city block, the plaza was imagined as a vast mixed-use building project, offering city residents over 500 lavish condominiums, a five-star hotel, retail spaces, restaurants and a private 2-acre park. However, construction on the $1 billion project, which began in 2015, was shelved after the Chinese-backed contractor Oceanwide Holdings ran out of funding\u00a0in 2019 \u2014 and it has lain unfinished ever since. The plaza\u2019s status \u2014 and potential \u2014 as an eye-catching venue for their work spread by word of mouth within the graffiti community in recent months. Security at the site was known to be lax, an important detail as accessing the plaza\u2019s towers and other buildings constitutes trespassing. (The Los Angeles City Attorney confirmed to CNN that, as of April 3, criminal charges have been filed against 23 individuals, for violations including trespassing and possession of vandalism tools.) \u201cIt was like a gift from the graffiti gods\u2026 A giant canvas in the middle of downtown,\u201d tagger ENDEM told CNN, speaking on behalf of himself and his graffiti crew, NCT. \u201cWe were like, \u2018Let\u2019s do it right. Let\u2019s do it as if the whole world is going to see this.\u2019\u201d Historically, graffiti has often been used as protest art. While the practice dates back thousands of years, it\u2019s most commonly viewed in a contemporary context (within graffiti\u2019s \u201cmodern\u201d era, which dates back to the 1960s and 70s) as a creative vehicle for challenging societal norms and inequities \u2014 whether on the Berlin Wall in Germany or subway cars in New York City; whether painted by anonymous artists or well-known figures like Keith Haring or Banksy, even if the latter is, technically, anonymous himself. Still, neither ENDEM nor any of the other artists involved realized how famous their work on the Oceanside towers would become. Sharing his artwork on Instagram on January 31, a video from ENDEM quickly racked up tens of thousands of views: Vibrant images of bright block lettering splayed across the building\u2019s exterior paired with footage from the inside \u2014 the artist posing with shots of his spray paint cans, poised above the cityscape. The viral footage, among other visuals shared on social media, quickly opened the floodgates. Hitting Oceanside became a mark of credibility in the graffiti world; by mid-February, the number of tags and other graffiti pieces there were multiplying overnight. \u201cIt was an open house people going in and out. It was beautiful. It was like graffiti paradise,\u201d ENDEM said. \u201cIt felt exactly like the streets, but concentrated.\u201d Transformed in part into an art installation, Oceanwide became an opportunity for the graffiti artists to leave a message to the city below, and a call-out to policy makers who leave buildings to rot. \u201cGraffiti shows you where the city hurts,\u201d Roger Gastman, owner and founder of the LA-based arts organization Beyond the Streets, told CNN. Renowned for its large-scale exhibitions, immersive educational programs, pop-up events and partnerships, Beyond the Streets works to educate and celebrate the diverse dimensions of graffiti as a medium. To him, the mission of graffiti is clear: to challenge, educate, and redefine public perception of the medium. Earl Ofari Hutchinson, president of The Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable, a nonpartisan public policy forum\u00a0for civic participation and education,\u00a0sees the abandoned towers as amplifying the social issues of the community they are situated in, connecting the graffiti-laden structures to the urban blight that surrounds them in LA\u2019s Skid Row. Skid Row is a 50-block sector of downtown LA where between 8,000 and 11,000 unhoused people live in challenging, often squalid conditions. \u201cYou\u2019ve got tens of thousands of people displaced because of over urban development. And as a result of that, they\u2019re on the streets,\u201d Hutchinson told CNN, noting that the homeless population in Los Angeles is continuing to grow. (The Los Angeles Housing Services Authority reports a 9% increase in homelessness in LA county in 2023 and a 10% increase in the city from 2022.) \u201cNow, set right in the middle of that, you have\u2026 a development that will never be completed.\u201d \u201cWhat you have here is a classic urban nightmare brought on by very poor policies \u2014 fiscal, financial, budgetary and political problems (in) a city that has just gone off the rails in terms of over-development and lack of affordability,\u201d Hutchinson added. Still, Hutchinson is no fan of the graffiti either. To him, and many other LA residents who have said they disapprove of the \u201cvandalism,\u201d the plaza is a sore sight for eyes. \u201cThe problem is you\u2019re talking about violating public space and with no permission\u2026 that doesn\u2019t fly with me,\u201d Hutchinson said. \u201cThe fact of the matter is, the public has not given you approval. (And) the general public has to pay for the removal.\u201d Costs currently borne by the taxpayer at the Oceanwide Plaza site include the security details provided by the LAPD as well as the graffiti cleanup Hutchinson highlights. (\u201cThis has strained our deployment,\u201d LAPD Chief Michel Moore said during a February meeting of the Los Angeles City Council. \u201cWe have called in some officers on an overtime basis so that we can provide for these added patrols or station them at that site to deter vandals and others from gaining access.\u201d) Clean teams working in the neighborhoods surrounding Oceanwide remove on average some 2,000 square feet of graffiti per week, with that figure growing in recent months. \u201cPeople forget that people live here. People own businesses here and they don\u2019t want to have to spend the time and money to clean it up,\u201d said Blair Besten, executive director of the Historic Core of Downtown Los Angeles, an organization which works to improve the quality of life in downtown neighborhoods. The Historic Core prioritizes street sweeping, trash collection \u2014 and graffiti removal. \u201cI would hardly call what they\u2019re doing art,\u201d Besten argued of the Oceanwide taggers. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty sloppy and quick. They come in fast and they knock it out and they leave.\u201d But to Gastman, graffiti is a powerful form of expression, and a call-to-action \u2014 particularly for those who emanate from struggles within home life, gang life or societal turmoil. Graffiti culture can offer an unexpected support system for those the city has abandoned, Gastman said. It becomes a platform for them to make their voices heard. \u201cIn graffiti culture, a lot of us know each other. We\u2019re all friends. We have the same mentality \u2014 we\u2019re just trying to get up. We\u2019re just trying to get noticed,\u201d explained ENDEM. In the midst of an addiction that led to his rock bottom, graffiti became his lifeline, he explained. \u201cI was at my lowest of lows, still trying to stay sober, I needed some type of outlet,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cGraffiti is something that you can hold on to. Its bigger than me, its everyone, it\u2019s a community.\u201d In this, ENDEM believes that the beauty of Oceanwide isn\u2019t tangible. Rather, it lies in the birth of a new generation of graffiti writers. \u201cThey can erase the graffiti on buildings, but they can never erase the impact that it has on the city of Los Angeles and the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to it. Yes, it\u2019s vandalism. Yes, it\u2019s art, and it\u2019s everything in between,\u201d Gastman concluded. \u201cThis is a real culture. It\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/10/style/graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "world"}}

There\u2019s the Art Deco curved crown of the Chrysler Building, the sweeping isosceles triangles that twist around One World Trade Center, the stepped limestone and granite rectangles of the Empire State Building and the triangular prism of the Flatiron Building. And now, a multi-billion-dollar tower featuring floor-to-ceiling glass will add another dimension to the cityscape, according to new details unveiled by New York City Mayor Eric Adams this week. Stretching up 62 stories, a planned office tower at 350 Park Avenue will provide space for more than 6,000 jobs, plus 1.8 million square feet of commercial office space, according to a press release. It will be funded by Vornado Realty Trust, Kenneth Griffin, founder and CEO of global investment firm Citadel, and building and management company Rudin. White columns will frame a new public concourse at the base of the new building on Park Avenue, complete with green space, seating and art displays, images show. Above, landscaped terraces will top each section of the glass-clad tower which will house the offices for Citadel and market making firm Citadel Securities. Adams hailed the project in the release, saying it will help \u201csupercharge our economy and expand New York City\u2019s iconic skyline,\u201d building on \u201ccontinued efforts to energize Midtown Manhattan as the world\u2019s most important business address and an economic engine for working-class New Yorkers.\u201d Architects Foster + Partners have designed the building, which will replace the existing 30-story tower currently at the site in Midtown Manhattan just a few blocks away from landmarks like the Rockefeller Center, St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral and Grand Central Station. As New York continues to deal with the economic aftershocks wrought by the Covid-19 pandemic, Adams and his administration said in their respective statements that they hoped this project would continue the city\u2019s recovery. \u201cThis investment opens a new chapter for Midtown \u2014 and closes the book on those who predicted its demise,\u201d said deputy mayor for operations Meera Joshi. \u201cMidtown\u2019s revitalization is being led by its public realm \u2014 including investments in Fifth Avenue, with the crown jewels of Central Park and Bryant Park at either end. Together, with our business improvement district and parks partners, we are reintroducing Fifth Avenue to the world and creating a vibrant live, work, play community for a new era,\u201d Joshi added. Building this new office space comes at a fraught time for the commercial real estate market as businesses struggle to entice workers back to the office after years of working from home. This has left vast tranches of office space vacant or underused, causing the value of such buildings to plummet at the same time as historically high interest rates have made it harder for real estate developers \u2014\u00a0who often take out huge loans to finance projects \u2014\u00a0to make good on their repayments. The project will begin the city\u2019s public review process early next year and the tower is expected to be completed by 2032, according to the release.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/20/style/park-avenue-skyscraper-new-york-skyline-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "world"}}

At a separate protest, police said they arrested two people \u201cfor disorderly conduct\u201d after they allegedly left the approved demonstration site at the Kaplan intersection, headed to the Azrieli intersection and \u201clit fires and began to break the order, not obeying the police\u2019s instructions.\u201d \u201cA police officer declared the demonstration illegal and warned that if they did not disperse the police would be forced to use measures,\u201d police added in a statement.

Upon entering Rafah, the military\u00a0seized the city\u2019s border crossing\u00a0with Egypt, which has remained shut since. The crossing was a vital entry point for humanitarian aid. The court ordered Israel to open the Rafah crossing for humanitarian assistance and said it had found that the evacuation and living conditions provided by Israel are not \u201csufficient to alleviate the immense risk, which the Palestinian population is exposed\u201d to.  Rulings by the court are final and binding, but the ICJ doesn\u2019t have a mechanism to enforce them, and they have been ignored in the past. Israeli officials have condemned the ICJ\u2019s ruling. Yair Lapid, leader of Israel\u2019s opposition party Yesh Atid, said that \u201cthe fact that the ICJ did not even directly connect the end of the military operation in Rafah to the release of the hostages and to Israel\u2019s right to defend itself against terror is an abject moral failure.\u201d Naftali Bennett, who was the 13th\u00a0Prime Minister of Israel, wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter, that \u201cThe International Court of Justice just provided every terror organization on earth with THE PERFECT METHOD TO GET AWAY WITH MURDER.\u201d Hamas welcomed the order in a statement, but said it had expected it would be for the entire Gaza Strip, emphasizing that the situations in Jabalya and other cities are equally dire and warrant similar attention. South Africa filed an urgent request on May 10 for additional measures against Israel, accusing it of using forced\u00a0evacuation orders\u00a0in the southern Gaza city of Rafah to \u201cendanger rather than protect civilian life.\u201d The request was part of a larger case brought by Pretoria against Israel in which South Africa accuses Israel of committing genocide against Palestinians during the seven-month-long conflict. Israel\u2019s Deputy Attorney General for International Law Gilad Noam denied the allegations in his opening remarks at the ICJ last week and asked the court to \u201crespect the predicament\u201d Israel is in. Two interpretations Following the ruling, a joint statement by the Israel\u2019s National Security Council and Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Friday that Israel \u201chas not carried out and will not carry out military activity in the Rafah area that creates living conditions that could lead to the destruction of the Palestinian civilian population.\u201d In response to other orders by the ICJ, including keeping the Rafah crossing open, the statement said that Israel will \u201ccontinue its efforts to allow humanitarian aid to enter the Gaza Strip\u201d and \u201creduce as much as possible the harm to the civilian population in the Gaza Strip.\u201d Eliav Lieblich, a professor of international law at Tel Aviv University, told CNN that the text of the ruling had some ambiguity. \u201cThe order can be understood in two ways: either that Israel has to halt the offensive in Rafah; or specifically components that may lead to conditions of life that could bring physical destruction,\u201d he said. What is clear, however, is that in the eyes of the court, \u201cthe operation cannot continue in the same way, because it found that as it is now the situation is a risk to the rights protected by the (genocide) Convention,\u201d Lieblich said, adding that it is hard to tell whether Israel will comply with the ruling. \u201cI\u00a0hope that it doesn\u2019t argue that the order means that nothing has to change, because that clearly isn\u2019t the case,\u201d he added. The development comes as Israel faces mounting international and domestic pressure to end the war in Gaza. This week, the prosecutor at the International Criminal Court (ICC), a separate court in The Hague, sought arrest warrants for Hamas leaders as well as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity over the October 7 attacks on Israel and the subsequent war in Gaza. Families of Israeli hostages held in the territory also stepped up pressure on Netanyahu to bring the captives home, releasing graphic footage of female members of the Israel Defense Forces before they were abducted. Unclear how US will respond It is unclear how the US, Israel\u2019s closest ally, will respond to the ICJ\u2019s order. The Biden administration has spoken out strongly against the genocide case against Israel, but it has repeatedly warned Israel that Washington will not support a major ground offensive in Rafah unless it sees a credible plan to ensure the safety of civilians. This month, the US halted arms shipments to Israel for the first time out of fear that they could be used in Rafah to harm civilians. In an interview with CNN, US President Joe Biden acknowledged that American bombs had been used to kill civilians in Gaza, in a stark recognition of the US\u2019 role in the war. The US is Israel\u2019s biggest weapons supplier. The move by the ICJ is likely to add to mounting pressure on Israel to scale down its war in Gaza, but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that his country will defend itself even if \u201cforced to stand alone.\u201d Israel says that Rafah is the last bastion of Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that led an attack on Israel on October 7, killing 1,200 people and taking 250 hostages, according to Israeli authorities. Israel\u2019s subsequent war in Gaza has killed more than 35,000 people, according to the Health Ministry in Gaza. \u2018Unprecedented\u2019 pressure The international pressure facing Israel is \u201cunprecedented,\u201d Yossi Mekelberg, an associate fellow with the Middle East and North Africa Programme at the Chatham House think tank in London, told CNN. \u201cBecause this war is unprecedented, and the way Israel conducts the war is unprecedented.\u201d While there has always been criticism of some of Israel\u2019s actions, such as the expansion of settlements, \u201cthis is on a different scale, a different universe altogether,\u201d he said. \u201cThe current Israeli government does its best to make Israel a pariah state.\u201d The ruling could also undermine Israel\u2019s own judiciary, according to Neve Gordon, professor of human rights law at Queen Mary University of London. In response to the ICC\u2019s decision to seek arrest warrants against top Israeli officials, Israel\u2019s Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara and State Attorney Amit Aisman were cited by the Times of Israel as backing the Israeli military and said the judicial system is capable of handling such cases. \u201c(The) ruling would serve yet another blow to Israel\u2019s judicial system, and particularly the attorney general and the Supreme Court, since the subtext would be that it is not doing its job in ensuring that Israel abide by international law,\u201d said Gordon.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/middleeast/israel-icj-gaza-rafah-south-africa-ruling-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_europe_ukraine-russia-lyptsi-kharkiv-intl", "text": "There are some towns that\u00a0Ukraine\u00a0can just never afford to lose, and Lyptsi is one of them. But the grip\u00a0the\u00a0nation\u00a0keeps is tenuous:\u00a0The streets are aflame from an airstrike moments earlier when we race in, under\u00a0the\u00a0cover of darkness. Night affords them the only\u00a0respite\u00a0from drone assault; the hours before we arrive have seen the town hit eight\u00a0times. Yet the soldiers of the 13th Khartiia National Guard have to endure, as the stakes here are huge. Russia\u2019s relentless onslaught has a key goal:\u00a0If they take Lyptsi, then they can position artillery within range of Ukraine\u2019s second city, Kharkiv, 20 minutes down the road. Down in a bunker, Oleksandr, a commander, looks at one of his many drone feeds. \u201cYou saw yourself how everything is burning. It is like that every night.\u201d His men were among the first to tackle Russia\u2019s new advance into Kharkiv region nearly two weeks ago. He says they are fighting trained professional\u00a0soldiers. \u201cWe can see it from their equipment and tactics,\u201d\u00a0he says. \u201cThey\u2019re not sending just anyone into the assaults.\u201d His stare lengthens when asked about what fortifications were in place before the surprise Russian attack. \u201cNothing was prepared here. Nothing. Just nothing. All the positions are being built by the hands of infantry.\u201d Outside, the night is shaken by more blasts. \u201cThree weeks ago the civilians were living a peaceful life here. Rebuilding, everything was\u00a0all right,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd now most of the houses are ruined.\u201d As we leave, a loud drone buzzes overhead, close by. Our escort does not flinch or run. I ask if the drone is friendly. \u201cHow the f*** should I know?\u201d\u00a0he replies, tugging on a cigarette. All around the city of Kharkiv, home to an estimated million civilians, Ukrainian forces are trying to hold back a persistent Russian assault from multiple angles. Over a week reporting in the villages around the city, CNN saw Ukrainian units holding their positions at great peril and risk, and sometimes using aged and scant artillery to fend off a much better equipped Russian force, able to thwart their most basic\u00a0maneuvers\u00a0with huge numbers of drones. At one position closer to the Russian border, the 92nd Assault Brigade showed CNN a Russian artillery gun, captured in the first days of the war, from which they are now firing French mortar shells. The gun was partially hidden by a wire net, aimed\u00a0at providing\u00a0some protection from an attack drone. Yet above, an\u00a0unidentified scout drone began to hover, forcing the unit to run into a bunker. Another unit\u00a0is\u00a0forced to use a Soviet artillery gun made in the 1940s. Hidden in dense foliage, its metal is rusty in parts, limiting how often it can be fired. Artun, their commander, uses newer Polish shells, but now only fires 10\u00a0a day, when in the autumn it was\u00a0100. Drones are \u201ca big problem,\u201d\u00a0Artun\u00a0says. \u201cI have shrapnel in me as a keepsake,\u201d he adds, referring to the remnants of a Russian Lancet drone still in his hand and stomach, which\u00a0the surgeons could not remove. \u201cBut there are certain actions that can save you from drones.\u201d One of them springs into life: an alert from a $30 frequency scanner on his webbing. It has picked up the approach of another Orlan drone, sending Artun into the bunker. He looks out into the sky above, and sees it pass overhead. He commands a diverse unit, epitomizing the manpower challenges Ukraine is facing in its third year of war. Some, like him, are wounded infantrymen, put on the guns further back from the front. Others are older,\u00a0while\u00a0one of his team is on his first day in artillery. For nearly two years,\u00a0Kharkiv\u00a0thought the threat from its neighbour had passed. A lightning Russian retreat in late 2022 left Kharkiv region peaceful and the launchpad for Ukrainian attacks across the border into Russia proper. Attacks persisted\u00a0in the distance\u00a0however,\u00a0keeping the city\u2019s residents awake through violently loud nights, now amplified by the threat of Russian artillery edging closer. Flares, anti-aircraft fire,\u00a0and blasts regularly punctuate the enforced blackout, as Russian drones, rockets and airstrikes hit targets in the dark. On Wednesday, city officials reported an attack on a gas station, which left four people in hospital.\u00a0On Sunday, two missiles struck a lakeside resort in Cherkaska Lozova, outside the city\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a horrifying attack on a civilian target which also used a \u201cdouble-tap\u201d tactic, in which a second missile hit 10\u00a0minutes after the first, injuring first responders. A few hours after\u00a0Sunday\u2019s\u00a0blasts, rescue workers clambered over the ruins of a waterside terrace,\u00a0retrieving\u00a0two bodies from the seven who died in the attack. One was a woman,\u00a0seven\u00a0months pregnant. Another was only found later, their body fragments in the wreckage. As police combed the eviscerated terrace on the lake for evidence, another air alert sounded, causing half the workers to flee for cover, and some to carry on, almost oblivious.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/europe/ukraine-russia-lyptsi-kharkiv-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "world"}}

The Al-Nazla school in Saftawy, on the outskirts of Jabaliya, was being used as a temporary shelter by people fleeing violence when the strike took place. An eyewitness, Saleh Al-Aswad from Jabaliya, told CNN that his son-in-law is being treated for injuries sustained during the attack. He added that a \u201cman making bread for his children, thinking this was a safe space\u201d was killed along with his daughter, Afnan, and his son, Mohamed. CNN footage shows health workers at the Sheikh Radwan clinic tending to bodies wrapped in white sheets. One health worker shows the body of the deceased toddler Mohamed with injuries to his face. CNN has reached out to the Israeli military but has not yet heard back. Healthcare system \u2018on its knees\u2019 News of the strike comes as the humanitarian situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate. In a statement on X Saturday morning, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) warned that Gaza\u2019s healthcare system \u201cis on its knees\u201d as access to hospitals and facilities shrink further amid supply shortages and Israeli attacks. As of Friday, 15 out of 36 hospitals in Gaza were only partially functional, 21 hospitals were out of service, and there were six functional field hospitals, OCHA\u2019s report said, citing the WHO. Existing hospitals are operating at more than four times their bed capacity, according to the Gaza Ministry of Health, the agency said. \u201cShortages in fuel, medical supplies and equipment are threatening the ability of the remaining health facilities to operate,\u201d it added. So dire has the situation become that the director of the Kuwait hospital in Rafah posted a video plea on WhatsApp, to \u201csound the alarm to the WHO to keep this hospital operational and to guarantee it doesn\u2019t shut down by providing it with the necessary fuel.\u201d In his video appeal, Dr. Suhaib al-Homs says the Kuwait Hospital is now the only functioning hospital in central Rafah injured members of the public can reach \u201caround the clock,\u201d as the surrounding field hospitals are difficult to access without an ambulance. \u201cWe are warning of the mounting health crisis as hospitals are going out of service and the collapse of the health sector,\u201d he says. \u201cWe will keep on working and the medical teams will keep doing their job. What\u2019s happening now makes us more steadfast and adamant to fulfill our duty to serve our people.\u201d The UN aid agency has warned that some displaced people in central Gaza are now surviving on 3% of the minimum standard for daily water needs and that communicable diseases, including diarrhea and suspected Hepatitis A, continue to increase with children under the age of five being particularly affected. Earlier this week, the head of the WHO called on Israel to ease all restrictions on aid entering the Gaza Strip, saying the primary route for vital medical aid to enter Gaza from Egypt had been cut off amid an ongoing Israeli army operation on the southern Gaza city of Rafah.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/middleeast/drone-attack-school-jabalya-gaza-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_tech_fcc-weighs-ai-rules-political-ads", "text": "The Federal Communications Commission is taking initial steps toward new rules that could require political ads on TV and radio to include disclaimers about the use of artificial intelligence. On Wednesday, FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel called on other agency commissioners to support such regulations amid growing fears that AI-generated deepfakes could disrupt elections. \u201cAs artificial intelligence tools become more accessible, the Commission wants to make sure consumers are fully informed when the technology is used,\u201d Rosenworcel said in a news release.\u00a0\u201cToday, I\u2019ve shared with my colleagues a proposal that makes clear consumers have a right to know when AI tools are being used in the political ads they see, and I hope they swiftly act on this issue.\u201d Wednesday\u2019s proposal aims to open a rulemaking process at the FCC that would likely take months to play out. The proposal calls for new rules governing broadcast TV and radio, as well as cable and satellite providers. Under the proposed rules, political advertisers on those mediums would have to make on-air disclosures if their ads contain AI-generated content. The FCC does not regulate internet-based media such as streaming video services or social media. As part of the proposed rule, political advertisers would also have to provide written disclosures in the files that broadcasters are\u00a0required to make available\u00a0to the public. The FCC move seeks to fill\u00a0a yawning gap\u00a0in the regulation of artificial intelligence in political advertising. Existing US election law prohibits campaigns from \u201cfraudulently misrepresenting other candidates or political parties,\u201d but whether this prohibition extends to AI-generated content is an open question. Last summer,\u00a0Republicans on the Federal Election Commission blocked\u00a0a move that could have made clear the law extended to AI-created depictions; the FEC has since agreed to revive the discussion, but it has not reached a decision on the matter. In the meantime, some US lawmakers have proposed legislation that could clamp down on AI in elections. In March, a bipartisan proposal by Minnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski unveiled the\u00a0AI Transparency in Elections Act, which could require AI disclaimers on political ads. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York, has stressed the urgent need for Congress to create guardrails for artificial intelligence, particularly for elections. Last week, he and a bipartisan group of senators\u00a0released a blueprint\u00a0for legislative action. But many\u00a0policy analysts doubt\u00a0that Congress can pass meaningful AI legislation during an election year. Online platforms such as Meta have taken their own steps to address AI in political ads,\u00a0requiring campaigns\u00a0to disclose the use of deepfakes and banning the use of its\u00a0in-house generative AI tools\u00a0for political advertising.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/tech/fcc-weighs-ai-rules-political-ads/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "world"}}

We are investigating the case,\u201d Netanyahu said in a speech at the Israeli Knesset. At least 45 people were killed and more than 200 others injured after a fire broke out at the camp following the strike, most of them women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry and Palestinian medics. No hospital in Rafah had the capacity to take the number of casualties, the ministry said. Footage obtained by CNN showed the camp in flames, with scores of men, women and children frantically trying to find cover from the nighttime assault. Burned bodies, including those of children, could be seen being pulled by rescuers from the wreckage. \u201cSeveral civilians are still trapped inside the camp, which was attacked without warning,\u201d a Palestinian man filming the fire said. \u201cThis was declared a safe zone.\u201d United Nations Secretary-General\u00a0Ant\u00f2nio Guterres issued a blistering condemnation on Monday. \u201cI condemn Israel\u2019s actions which killed scores of innocent civilians who were only seeking shelter from this deadly conflict,\u201d\u00a0he said on X. \u201cThere is no safe place in Gaza. This horror must stop.\u201d A UN diplomat told CNN that the Security Council will hold an emergency meeting Tuesday to discuss the airstrike at the request of Algeria. It will hold private discussions at 3.30 p.m., the diplomat said. A US official told CNN Monday that Israel had told the Biden administration it used a precision munition to hit a target in Rafah, but that the explosion from the strike ignited a fuel tank nearby and started a fire that engulfed a camp for displaced Palestinians and led to dozens of deaths. \u201cWe can\u2019t confirm that but it\u2019s what Israel shared with us,\u201d the official said, \u201cand we assume we will learn more once Israel completes its investigation.\u201d The attack came after Hamas launched rockets at Tel Aviv on Sunday for the first time in months. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said that eight rockets were fired from the Rafah area, and that \u201ca number of projectiles\u201d had been intercepted. The IDF said it destroyed the rocket launchers used by Hamas shortly after the strikes. The Israeli military said in a statement earlier on Monday that it had struck \u201ca compound in Rafah in which significant Hamas terrorists were operating.\u201d It said the strike killed two Hamas officials \u2013 West Bank Chief of Staff Yassin Rabia and senior Hamas member Khaled Nagar. CNN cannot verify these claims. The IDF said in a later statement Monday that its Fact Finding and Assessment Mechanism \u2013 an independent body responsible for examining allegations of misconduct in conflict \u2013 will investigate the \u201ccircumstances of the deaths of civilians in the area of the strike.\u201d It was among the deadliest strikes by the Israeli military on Gaza\u2019s southernmost city since Israel began its operation there on May 7. It also came just days after the International Court of Justice (ICJ), the United Nations\u2019 top court, ordered Israel to \u201cimmediately halt\u201d its military operation in Rafah, and any other action in the city, \u201cwhich may inflict on the Palestinian group in Gaza conditions of life that could bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part.\u201d The IDF said the attack was conducted based on \u201cprior intelligence\u201d indicating that senior officials of Hamas\u2019 West Bank wing were present at the site. The IDF said it had assessed there would be \u201cno expected harm to uninvolved civilians.\u201d More than 36,000 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its military operation there, according to the Ministry of Health in the enclave, which started after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on October 7, killing 1,200 people and taking 250 hostages, according to Israeli authorities. \u2018Hell on earth\u2019 Footage of the aftermath shared on social media showed chaotic scenes. In one video, the lifeless body of a man was seen being dragged by the legs out of the flames. \u201cHe\u2019s dead, he\u2019s dead,\u201d a rescuer says before moving on to find others. In another video, a man wept as he held up the headless body of a toddler for the camera. Women shrieked in grief as children peered into the fire. A man with a bloodied face stood in apparent shock, examining his wounds with one hand, as he held an infant with blood-stained clothes in the other arm. One of the bodies pulled out of the fire was charred-stiff. By Monday morning, the camp was in ruins with small fires still burning. Men and boys gathered around, rummaging through the burned and smoking wreckage for food and their belongings as drones hovered above. One of the structures still standing was a sign that read: \u201cKuwait peace camp 1.\u201d Children and women living in makeshift tents were among those killed, according to a post on X from UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini. \u201cThe images from last night are testament to how Rafah has turned into hell on earth,\u201d the commissioner-general said Monday. \u201cOthers were reportedly burnt to death,\u201d Lazzarini said. The reporting is based on open-source photos and videos which were shared with UNRWA, including from social media, UNRWA spokesperson Juliette Touma told CNN. Mohammad Abu Al Subeh, a displaced Palestinian man who survived the strike, said as he was lying in bed in the evening when he saw \u201crockets fired down at us.\u201d \u201cIt shook the earth like an earthquake,\u201d Abu Al Subeh, who fled his home in Nuseirat some five months ago, told CNN. He had to escape through the window of his makeshift house  in the desert area where the camp is located. \u201cI came here based on the leaflet that was dropped (by Israel) saying go to this humanitarian area,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just civilians here.\u201d Abu Nidal Al Attar, another displaced Palestinian who witnessed the attack, told CNN: \u201cWe were sitting as normal people do\u201d when they suddenly saw strikes and fire. \u201cWe went to see, and they were pulling out burned people.\u201d Hamas called the attack \u201ca horrific war crime\u201d and \u201cterrible massacre.\u201d International outrage International condemnation was swift, with UN agencies, aid groups and governments calling on Israel to respect the ICJ ruling and halt its Rafah operation. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Monday condemned the airstrike. \u201cThere is no safe place in Gaza. This horror must stop,\u201d he said in a post on X. \u201cDespite the ICJ binding ruling, Israel struck Rafah and Hamas fired rockets to Israel,\u201d the EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, wrote Monday on X. \u00a0On Monday, in a meeting with Arab leaders to discuss Gaza and the Middle, Borrell said that \u201cwhat we have seen in the immediate hours is that Israel continues the military action that it has been asked to stop.\u201d Medical charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said it was \u201chorrified by this deadly event, which shows once again that nowhere is safe.\u201d The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) said \u201cGaza is hell on earth,\u201d referring to the Rafah attack. French President Emmanuel Macron said he was \u201coutraged\u201d and called for an \u201cimmediate ceasefire.\u201d Critics have pushed back on Israel\u2019s claims. Already worried about an intensifying war right on its border with Gaza, Egypt on Monday condemned Israel\u2019s strike on Rafah, calling on the Jewish state to implement the ICJ ruling of \u201chalting military operations\u201d in Rafah and to \u201ccomply with its responsibilities as an occupying power\u201d. A mediator in the war, Egypt is set to host another round of indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas on Tuesday. Qatar, another key mediator, said Israel\u2019s strike could \u201chinder\u201d ongoing negotiations, and called the attack a \u201cserious violation of international law.\u201d Over a million Palestinians had been sheltering in Rafah before Israel began its operations there, having fled there from other areas of Gaza after Israel began its military campaign in the territory. Israel has said it had ordered civilians to leave some areas of Rafah, but many remain there, sheltering in what Israel designated as \u201csafe zones.\u201d More than 800,000 people have fled Rafah since May 6, according to UN figures. Israel has vowed to press on with its Rafah operation despite international outrage and a US warning not to proceed. In response to the ICJ ruling last week, Israel said it \u201chas not and will not conduct military actions in the Rafah area which may inflict on the Palestinian civilian population in Gaza conditions of life that could bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part.\u201d Clarification: This story has been updated after additional review of the translation from Hebrew to English, to clarify the wording used by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu when he referred to a deadly Israeli strike on Rafah, Gaza.\u00a0The word\u00a0\u201cerror\u201dwas originally translated as \u201cmistake.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/27/middleeast/gaza-rafah-displaced-people-camp-israel-strike-mime-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "world"}}

Extreme temperatures throughout Asia over the past month were made worse most likely as a result of\u00a0human-driven climate change, a team of international scientists have said. In Mohenjo Daro, a town in Sindh known for archaeological sites that date back to the Indus Valley Civilization built in 2500 BC, temperatures rose as high as 52.2 C (126 F) over the last 24 hours, a senior official of the Pakistan Meteorological Department, Shahid Abbas told Reuters. The reading is the highest of the summer so far, and approached the town\u2019s and country\u2019s record highs of 53.5 C (128.3 F) and 54 C (129.2 F) respectively. Mohenjo Daro is a small town that experiences extremely hot summers and mild winters, and low rainfall, but its limited markets, including bakeries, tea shops, mechanics, electronic repair shops, and fruit and vegetable sellers, are usually bustling with customers. But with the current heat wave, shops are seeing almost no footfall. \u201cThe customers are not coming to the restaurant because of extreme heat.

{"id": "2024_05_24_middleeast_israel-isolation-deepens-icj-gaza-rafah-analysis-intl", "text": "It\u2019s been a tumultuous month for Israel. Never before has the Jewish state come under such intense and sustained international pressure from multiple fronts for its policies towards the Palestinians. This week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu joined the ranks of world leaders branded as international pariahs when he became the target of the International Criminal Court, whose prosecutor is seeking an arrest warrant against him and his defense minister, Yoav Gallant for suspicion of war crimes and crimes against humanity during Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. The court has previously sought warrants against the likes of Sudan\u2019s Omar Al Bashir, Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin and Libya\u2019s Moammar Gadhafi. And on Friday, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ordered Israel to immediately halt its controversial military operation in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, saying the humanitarian situation there is \u201cdisastrous\u201d and expected to \u201cintensify further.\u201d Seven months after Hamas attacked Israel, killing around 1,200 people and taking 250 hostages, Israel\u2019s retaliatory war has failed to achieve its goals. Top Hamas leaders remain at large and 125 hostages remain captive in the enclave. Gaza is now in ruins and more than 35,000 Palestinians have died during Israel\u2019s onslaught. Pressure on Israel to end the war is mounting from all sides: US college campuses, international courts, American celebrities, Israel\u2019s Western allies, and even the families of the Israeli hostages. But the most significant of those may be the legal and diplomatic action taken against Israel this month. Israeli officials are scrambling to contain the fallout. They have accused critics of antisemitism and vowed not to relent in the face of international pressure. \u201cEven if Israel is forced to stand alone, we will stand alone, and we will continue to strike our enemies powerfully until victory,\u201d Netanyahu declared in a fiery speech at the opening ceremony of Holocaust Remembrance Day this month. Palestinian statehood For years, Israeli officials have opposed unilateral recognitions of Palestinian statehood, fearing it would enable the Palestinians to bring Israel before international courts and weaken its position in future peace negotiations. The Palestinians have therefore failed to gain full membership at the United Nations due to objections from the US, Israel\u2019s closest ally and primary defender on the world stage. However, a non-binding vote at the UN General Assembly on May 10 showed overwhelming international support for an independent Palestinian state, leaving the US and a few of Israel\u2019s allies isolated. Israel and the US maintain that a Palestinian state should only be established through a negotiated settlement. But as Israel continues to reject the prospect of Palestinian independence, some states have chosen to act independently. This week, Ireland, Spain and Norway\u00a0announced\u00a0plans to formally recognize a Palestinian state, saying they hope the move would prod other European nations to follow suit. \u201cWe live in a time in world history where doing the bare minimum is both heroic and insufficient. That is why we cannot stop,\u201d Spanish Deputy Prime Minister Yolanda D\u00edaz said in a video posted on her X page. \u201cPalestine will be free from the river to the sea,\u201d she added, using a pro-Palestinian protest slogan that Israel says calls for its destruction, a charge rejected by those who use it. The move prompted swift condemnation from Israel, which recalled its ambassadors from all three countries. Aside from international efforts to end the war, Netanyahu is also under intense pressure domestically to strike a deal with Hamas to bring back the hostages. With hostage-ceasefire talks stalled, relatives of the captives are pressing the prime minister to return to negotiation. This week, the families of seven female Israeli soldiers captured by Hamas released graphic footage of their abduction to pile pressure on the government to secure their release. But there were signs that the talks may resume. On Thursday, the Israeli war cabinet directed the country\u2019s negotiating team to resume talks, without saying when they\u2019ll take place, and CIA Director Bill Burns has traveled to Europe to try to get the deal back on track, a US official told CNN, adding that the Israelis are \u201cvery engaged.\u201d Quandary for Israel\u2019s allies The cases brought before the ICJ and ICC have tested Western states\u2019 commitment to the rules-based international order as they struggle to navigate the increasing legal actions against their ally in these courts. This has created a rift between Israel\u2019s Western allies and a growing coalition of Global South countries spanning Asia, Africa, and South America that are increasingly vocal in their calls for Israel to be held accountable for its actions in Gaza. In a recent case at the ICJ, Germany was compelled to defend its arms sales to Israel against allegations of \u201cfacilitating genocide\u201d brought by Nicaragua. Despite the pressure, the court rejected the demand for an immediate halt to Germany\u2019s arms exports to Israel. Meanwhile, the ICC\u2019s decision to pursue arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Gallant has divided Israel\u2019s Western allies. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Christiane Amanpour, Karim Khan, the ICC\u2019s prosecutor, recounted a conversation with a senior leader who remarked: \u201cThis court is built for Africa and for thugs like Putin,\u201d underscoring the complexities surrounding international legal proceedings. While the US and the United Kingdom have denounced the move, European nations such as France, Germany, and others have affirmed the independence of the court and have not ruled out the possibility of arresting Israeli officials if they enter their territory following the issuance of a warrant. The court is also\u00a0pursuing warrants against three top Hamas officials: Ismail Haniyeh, Yahya Sinwar, and Mohammed Deif. A panel of judges at the ICC is still deliberating on whether to issue these warrants. The response to the warrant request has been particularly fierce in the US Congress, where a bipartisan effort to penalize the ICC is underway, potentially including sanctions.\u00a0US Secretary of State Antony Blinken plans to work with Congress on legislation to penalize the ICC. \u201cIf they do this to Israel, we\u2019re next,\u201d Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who has led the efforts against the ICC in Congress, told a Senate hearing this week \u2013 a reminder that however much pressure Israel is under, it still has one very powerful friend.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/middleeast/israel-isolation-deepens-icj-gaza-rafah-analysis-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "world"}}

The violence in North Darfur has intensified as the paramilitary group Rapid Support Forces (RSF) encircle El Fasher. The fighting also affects thousands of displaced people who have fled to El Fasher from the other four Darfur states now controlled by the RSF. According to UNICEF, at least 500,000 people sheltering in the city have been displaced by violence elsewhere in Sudan.

{"id": "2024_05_22_uk_uk-early-elections-sunak-conservatives-intl", "text": "UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced a snap general election for July\u00a04 in a statement outside Downing Street on Wednesday evening, as his Conservative Party faces an uphill struggle to extend its 14 years in power. Sunak said\u00a0outside Downing Street\u00a0that he had informed King Charles III of the rare summer poll, firing the starting gun on a\u00a0six-week\u00a0campaign that is almost universally expected to conclude in the demise of his Conservative government. Soaked by a downpour as he spoke, Sunak said: \u201cNow is the moment for Britain to choose its future.\u201d He also attacked his opponents, saying that by voting for the Labour Party, Britain would \u201crisk going back to square one.\u201d But he admitted: \u201cI cannot and will not claim that we have got everything right.\u201d Sunak was required to hold a vote by January 2025, and had long resisted calls to be specific about his plans. But a fall in inflation rates, announced earlier Wednesday, provided the backdrop for his announcement. The move\u00a0will be welcomed by the buoyant Labour Party, led by Keir Starmer, which is soaring in the opinion polls and has sought to present itself as a reformed and moderate group that is ready for power. In the wake of the announcement, Buckingham Palace said the British royal family would postpone engagements \u201cwhich may appear to divert attention or distract from the election campaign.\u201d The King and Queen\u2019s D-Day memorial engagements in June are expected to go ahead as scheduled. In his speech, Sunak sought to paint external factors such as Covid-19 and the war in Ukraine as the context to Britain\u2019s economic struggles, saying the two factors combined represented \u201cthe most challenging times since the Second World War.\u201d But he battled heavy rain that soaked his suit in just minutes, and he was almost drowned out by a loudspeaker outside the Downing Street gates, through which a protester blared D:Ream\u2019s \u201cThings Can Only Get Better,\u201d the theme song of Labour\u2019s big election win in 1997. Starmer was quick to respond to Sunak\u2019s announcement. Speaking at an indoor news conference, the opposition leader said: \u201cTonight the prime minister has finally announced the next general election.\u201d He framed the vote as a \u201cchance to change for the better \u2013 your future, your community, your country.\u201d \u201cIt will feel like a long campaign, I\u2019m sure of that, but no matter what else is said and done, that opportunity for change is what this election is about,\u201d he said. Current polling is dire for Sunak; Labour begins the campaign around 20 points up on average, with the Tories often closer to third-party challengers such as Reform and the Liberal Democrats than they are to Labour. When converted to a projection of seats in parliament, those figures indicate either a comfortable Labour win or a potential electoral wipeout for the Conservatives. Sunak will hope that a shrewd campaign could result in a spectacular upset for Labour and extend a period of Tory rule which began in 2010 and has overseen austerity economics, Brexit, the Covid pandemic and a cost of living crisis. He is the fifth Tory leader to serve during that time, taking over from the ill-fated Liz Truss, whose disastrous term imploded just six weeks after it began and exacerbated the financial woes crippling the United Kingdom. Sunak\u2019s party will likely put his efforts to tackle illegal migration at the center of his campaign; a recent move to deport some asylum seekers to Rwanda finally became law last month, and the first flights could potentially leave during the campaign. But Labour will seek to highlight the government\u2019s struggles to ease soaring prices, the state of Britain\u2019s over-stretched healthcare service, and the sleaze scandals that have tanked the Tories\u2019 reputation among a large swath of British voters. Smaller parties could upend the designs of the two dominant groups, even if it is virtually impossible for them to return a government. The new, anti-migration Reform Party and the centrist Liberal Democrats will look to challenge Sunak in some of his party\u2019s historical strongholds, complicating his efforts to hold power. North of the border, the pro-independence Scottish National Party will hope to hold off a Labour challenge and regain its dominance in Scotland\u2019s politics despite a rocky period and the recent ascension of its third leader in 15 months. The Conservatives under former Prime Minister Boris Johnson won a healthy majority in the last UK-wide vote, in December 2019, pledging to push through Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union \u2013 an issue that had transfixed politics in the country for more than three years. But Johnson\u2019s premiership collapsed after a string of scandals, paving the way for his then-finance minister Sunak to emerge as a frontrunner for the leadership. Adding to the sense that the Conservatives are nearing the end of their time in power, dozens of Tory MPs \u2014 including former cabinet ministers and ex-Prime Minister Theresa May \u2014 announced they would not seek re-election. But recent election and referendum campaigns have proved volatile, and Tories still publicly hopeful of success have pointed to mixed levels of enthusiasm for Labour\u2019s offering. The vote will take place on\u00a0Thursday July 4\u00a0in all of the UK\u2019s 650 parliamentary constituencies,\u00a0and counting will occur overnight, with the two main parties seeking to cross the 326 mark needed for a majority. A government will be formed as soon as that mark is crossed, and take charge immediately, pending the symbolic approval of King Charles III.

{"id": "2024_05_26_india_cyclone-remal-india-bangladesh-landfall-intl-hnk", "text": "At least 36 people have died in India and Bangladesh after Tropical\u00a0Cyclone\u00a0Remal lashed the area with torrential rain and heavy winds, according to local officials. At least seven were killed in cyclone-related incidents in the eastern Indian state of West Bengal as of Monday evening, Javed Khan, the state\u2019s minister for disaster management, told CNN Tuesday. Previously, seven deaths were reported in the southern Indian state of Telangana, 12 in the northeast Indian state of Mizoram, and 10 in Bangladesh. The Indian Meteorological Department on Tuesday said Remal weakened into a depression over east Bangladesh after losing some force earlier on Monday. It caused wide-scale damage in both countries, toppling trees, turning roads into rivers and leaving millions without electricity. More than 1 million people in India and Bangladesh were evacuated Sunday as the cyclone made landfall near the border of between the two countries. Authorities said that volunteers and army staff were mobilized to assist with clean-up efforts, and distribute food and water to displaced families. Remal made landfall roughly 80 kilometers (50 miles) southeast of the Indian city of Kolkata, packing gusts of up to 135 kilometers per hour (84 miles per hour), and is moving northwards across Bangladesh and its adjoining West Bengal coasts, the Indian Meteorological Department said. The storm weakened after it hit the coast with wind speeds of up to 115 kilometers per hour (71 mph). Remal is expected to dump more than 89 millimeters (3.5 inches) of rain and bring wind-driven storm surges of 2.5 to 3.7 meters to the coasts of the Bay of Bengal, according to CNN Weather. The maritime ports of Mongla and Payra in Bangladesh put up the Great Danger Signal 10 \u2014 the highest alert signal \u2014 on Sunday, and all fishing and boating vessels were advised to remain in shelter by the Bangladesh Meteorological Department. About 2 million people live in storm-affected areas in Bangladesh, according to non-profit BRAC.  At least half a million of these people \u201clive in houses made of materials such as clay, wood, plastic sheets, straw or tin,\u201d said Dr. Md Liakath Ali, a disaster expert at BRAC. The country is one of the world\u2019s most vulnerable to the impacts of the climate crisis, studies show.  Millions are without power as authorities shut down electricity supply to many areas in advance to avoid accidents, according to Ali. Fallen trees and broken lines disrupted supply, he said. An especially vulnerable group are the stateless Rohingya communities who fled persecution in nearby Myanmar during a military crackdown in 2017. They are already\u00a0living in the world\u2019s largest refugee camps in Cox\u2019s Bazar, which is at risk of landslides and floods, owing to the flimsy structure of their shelters. Many live in bamboo and tarpaulin shelters perched on hilly slopes that are vulnerable to strong winds, rain, and landslides. Video taken by a BRAC\u2019s volunteer early Monday in Mongla showed a woman struggling to walk through the floodwaters as gusts of wind nearly toppled her over. In India, video from the country\u2019s National Disaster Response Force showed workers removing broken trees in the state of West Bengal as heavy rain lashed down on them. The Coast Guard was seen closely monitoring Remal\u2019s landfall, with ships and hovercraft on standby to respond to any challenges, it said. Hundreds of flights were also impacted following the closure on Sunday of the main international airport in the Indian city of Kolkata, West Bengal state\u2019s capital. Air traffic in and out of the airport resumed on Monday, but disruptions continued with dozens of flights delayed, according to the airport\u2019s official website. Tropical Cyclone Remal has been churning across the Bay of Bengal since late last week\u00a0 prompting authorities to prepare ahead of its arrival. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said he had reviewed disaster management and preparation efforts. \u201cI pray for everyone\u2019s safety and wellbeing,\u201d Modi wrote on X. Cyclones, also known as typhoons and called hurricanes in North America, are enormous heat engines of wind and rain that feed on warm ocean water and moist air. And scientists say the climate crisis is making them more potent. A study published in 2021 by researchers at the Shenzhen Institute of Meteorological Innovation and the Chinese University of Hong Kong and published in Frontiers in Earth Science found that tropical cyclones in Asia could have double the destructive power by the end of the century, with scientists saying the human-made climate crisis is already making them stronger. The cyclone comes as parts of Western and Central India continue to bake under severe heat, with temperatures soaring beyond 45 degrees Celsius (113 Fahrenheit) in some cities, causing illness and forcing some schools to close. Climate scientists have long warned that these extremes of weather will only continue to intensify because of the climate crisis, with millions of people in India vulnerable to the risks associated with it.

The oil on canvas work depicts Jesus wearing a crown of thorns with blood running down his face and onto his chest. In front of him to the left is Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor in Judea, while a third figure stands behind Jesus holding a red robe over his shoulders. Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio, better known simply as Caravaggio, is known for his visceral depictions of violence. Caravaggio painted \u201cEcce Homo\u201d toward the end of his life when he had fled Rome, accused of murder, and was living in exile in Naples, where his work underwent a marked shift in style, becoming darker and more somber. \u201cThe painting is one of around only 60 known works by Caravaggio in existence, and thus one of the most valuable old master artworks in the world,\u201d said the museum. Formerly part of King Philip IV\u2019s art collection, the painting was passed on to the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando, which then exchanged it for another artwork with a politician named Evaristo P\u00e9rez de Castro in 1823, according to the museum. It then remained in the same family, but its significance went unnoticed until it surfaced at auction house Ansorena in April 2021 with a starting price of 1,500 euros ($1,600), attributed to a pupil of Spanish painter Jos\u00e9 de Ribera. Experts from the Prado Museum highlighted the misattribution to Spain\u2019s Ministry of Culture, which placed an export ban on the work and declared it a national treasure, Jorge Coll, CEO of Colnaghi Gallery in Madrid, which has had the painting in its care since its real origin came to light, told CNN on Tuesday. Coll then coordinated the authentication of the work by leading experts, as well its restoration, before it was sold to the current owner. Coll told CNN that he cannot reveal the identity of the buyer or the purchase price for legal reasons. The painting represents \u201cone of the greatest discoveries in the history of art, inspiring an unprecedented speed of consensus around its authentication,\u201d said the museum. It has also been restored \u201cin an informed and rigorous manner,\u201d reads the statement. \u201cEcce Homo\u201d will be displayed at the Prado Museum until October 13.

But four other Americans still await their fate. In recent months, all were arrested and accused of bringing in various amounts of ammunition to the 40-island chain southeast of the Bahamas. In the Turks and Caicos, possession of firearms or ammunition carries a minimum 12-year sentence, though the law allows reduced sentences under \u201cexceptional circumstances,\u201d the local governor said. Bryan Hagerich of Pennsylvania had pleaded guilty to the charge, the Turks and Caicos government said. On Friday, he got a 52-week sentence that was suspended for one year, meaning he would not face immediate incarceration, Hagerich\u2019s attorney Oliver Smith, King\u2019s Counsel, told CNN. Hagerich was allowed to leave the British Overseas Territory and return to the United States once he paid the fine, Smith said. He would have to serve the full 12-month sentence if the fine was not paid. Hagerich flew back to the US Friday afternoon, according to Johnathan Franks, a spokesperson for the Bring Our Families Home Campaign.

One was allowed to return to the US for medical reasons, and the rest are staying in Turks and Caicos. US lawmakers tried to get Americans freed A US congressional delegation traveled to the islands this week and asked for charges to be dropped for the five Americans whom they said \u201cinadvertently\u201d had ammunition in their luggage. Hagerich\u2019s sentencing came after the US officials expressed disappointment over their attempted intervention. \u201cUnfortunately, despite our willingness to work with Turks and Caicos officials to get our constituents home, we were not able to find a path forward,\u201d Republican Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma said in a statement this week. In addition to Hagerich, two other Americans \u2013 Michael Lee Evans and Tyler Wenrich \u2013 have pleaded guilty to possession of ammunition while traveling in Turks and Caicos, according to the territory\u2019s government. Evans was allowed to return to the US over a \u201csevere\u201d medical situation, but will be required to return to Turks and Caicos for his next hearing, Smith said. A fourth American, Ryan Tyler Watson, will have a hearing Tuesday to determine if he will enter a plea or go to trial, Smith said. A fifth American, Sharitta Shinese Grier, was arrested last week and is awaiting trial after making bail, according to Kimo Tynes\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b, director of communications in the Office of the Premier and Public Policy. Watson\u2019s wife, who will appear\u00a0in\u00a0Turks\u00a0and\u00a0Caicos\u00a0court\u00a0next\u00a0week\u00a0for her husband\u2019s ammunition offenses, told CNN her husband\u00a0plans\u00a0to\u00a0employ a similar legal strategy\u00a0as Hagerich. \u201cI think we\u2019re\u00a0planning\u00a0to\u00a0kind of follow the\u00a0same path\u00a0that Bryan did,\u201d Valerie Watson told CNN on Saturday. \u201cI think they\u2019ve got a plan that they\u2019ve already come up with.\u201d Hagerich and Watson share the same attorney, Valerie Watson said. \u201cI think he\u2019s ready\u00a0to\u00a0just go\u00a0in\u00a0(to\u00a0court) on Tuesday so they can get that going,\u201d she added. Turks and Caicos: No special treatment should be given to any group Turks and Caicos Gov. Dileeni Daniel-Selvaratnam said the mandatory minimum 12-year sentence for possession of firearms or ammunition is in place to protect those on the islands, and judges may use their discretion to impose reduced sentences in \u201cexceptional circumstances.\u201d But no special treatment should be given to any group, the Turks and Caicos premier said. \u201cThe law must be applied even-handedly,\u201d Misick said. And US citizens are not being targeted, Turks and Caicos officials said. Of the 195 people sentenced for firearm-related offenses over the past six years, only seven were US citizens, Misick said Thursday. No US citizen has received the 12-year sentence to date. Even though the territory doesn\u2019t manufacture firearms or ammunition, the number of firearms finding their way to the islands has increased, Misick said. By contrast, the United States has more guns than people. Now, bringing firearms or ammunition into Turks and Caicos without prior permission from police is \u201cstrictly forbidden.\u201d While the US and Turks and Caicos collaborate in battling narcotics, terrorism and money laundering, \u201cour laws and processes are not congruent,\u201d Misick said. \u201cWe are a separate sovereignty. We respect the United States\u2019 laws and we will never think to interfere in its operation.\u201d But at least one appointed member of the opposition, Alvin Garland, expressed concern about the American citizens\u2019 arrests. Garland said the islands\u2019 governor is correct in not interfering with the ongoing court cases in order to adhere to the government\u2019s separation of powers, but added he believes most, if not all, of the cases involving American tourists will fall into the \u201cexceptional circumstances category\u201d and sentences could be shorter than the mandatory 12-year minimum.

Satellite imagery from before and after the landslide show a vast section of the landscape in the mountainous Enga region essentially torn away. The vast size of the slide is even more visible from nearer the ground. More than 150 houses in Yambali village were buried in debris, officials said Sunday. The country\u2019s National Disaster Center said almost 2,000 were feared to be buried. The landslide\u00a0hit the remote village of Kaokalam, about 600 kilometers (372 miles) northwest of the capital Port Moresby, at approximately 3 a.m. local time on Friday (1 p.m. Thursday ET), leaving a scar of debris that humanitarian workers said was\u00a0as big as\u00a0four football fields. The phenomenon slammed tons of rock and mud into locals\u2019 homes as they slept, and rescuers struggled to reach such a remote part of what is already one of Asia\u2019s poorest nations, leaving villagers with no choice but to dig through the collapsed mountainside with whatever tools they had. The area has remained unstable, with smaller landslides occurring regularly and endangering rescue workers, Sandis Tsaka told CNN. \u201cWe\u2019re getting huge rocks and debris that keep falling down and land further beyond the original landslide area are being impacted,\u201d Tsaka said. He added the government had ordered nearly 7,000 people to evacuate.

{"id": "2024_05_25_style_zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk", "text": "Above Beijing\u2019s imperial center rises Jingshan, or Prospect Hill. From a pagoda at its modest peak, a panoramic view of the city presents itself. To the south, the dull golden roofs of the Forbidden City crest and fall, pulling the eye southward to Tiananmen \u2014 the Gate of Heavenly Peace \u2014 and the vast square of the same name just beyond. To the east stand the smooth metallic skyscrapers of the city\u2019s business district. To the north, at the top of Beijing\u2019s central axis \u2014 its so-called dragon\u2019s vein \u2014 sit the Bell and Drum Towers, which once acted as the city\u2019s collective timepiece. And stretching all along the western periphery are the calm, tree-lined waters of the manmade lakes, dug by hand for the pleasure of past emperors. It\u2019s this aerial view of \u201cZhongnanhai,\u201d meaning \u201cmiddle and southern seas,\u201d and the surrounding buildings that today\u2019s Chinese leaders prefer you did not see. That\u2019s because the 1,500-acre site of repurposed imperial pavilions and temples, along with gray modern offices has formed the leadership compound for the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP)  since 1950. As the seat of power, Zhongnanhai is often thought of as China\u2019s equivalent to the White House, or the Kremlin. Synonymous with China\u2019s communist party elite, and among the country\u2019s most secretive places, it is ringed by a centuries-old red ochre wall, with countless CCTV cameras periscoping above it \u2014 and patrolled assiduously by security forces in both plain clothes and uniform. A peaceful getaway For Chinese leader Xi Jinping\u2019s imperial forebears, the site served a somewhat different function. While emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties ruled their vast kingdom from within the Forbidden City, they built temples, halls and living quarters in Zhongnanhai; less grandly ceremonial than those of the palace, they were often oriented to take advantage of the views afforded by the area\u2019s tranquil waters and carefully planned gardens. Many of these emperors came to favor passing their days surrounded by drooping willows in the cool and quiet of this cultivated pleasure garden. A story relayed by the scholar Geremie Barm\u00e9 in his book \u201cThe Forbidden City\u201d tells of the 18th-century Qianlong Emperor\u2019s daily routine at Zhongnanhai: Each morning, after a first breakfast of cold swallows nest soup, he would travel by heated palanquin to the gardens\u2019\u00a0Studio of Convivial Delight,\u00a0a pavilion he built to capitalize on the view of the South Lake, where he would breakfast again on a meal of\u00a018 dishes. As the historian and author of \u201cThe Shortest History of China,\u201d Linda Jaivin, told CNN via email: \u201cThere is something outrageous and yet poetic about the incredible coordination and effort required of a team of bearers, cooks and attendants, just so that an emperor could come, catch a view of the magnificent Ocean Terrace, scoff his food and (leave).\u201d The first ruler to view Zhongnanhai as primarily a place to govern from, not simply relax in, was the Empress Dowager Cixi, who effectively controlled China for almost five decades from 1861. She lived for many years in the gardens\u2019 Hall of Ceremonial Phoenixes, which became the center of political authority in China. She would die there in 1908. The serene surroundings of Zhongnanhai also became, under Cixi, a place of punishment and confinement. In 1898, following attempted reforms that displeased her, Cixi imprisoned her nephew, the Guangxu Emperor, on Yingtai Island, which juts out into the southern lake. Built as a miniature version of the mythical Penglai island, home to the immortals of Chinese legend, the tiny piece of land would become the emperor\u2019s home for most of his life, bar a brief period when the Boxer rebellion of 1900 forced the whole court to flee the capital. He would die on Yingtai Island from arsenic poisoning the day before the Empress Dowager herself. His imprisonment and death, said writer M. A. Aldrich, author of \u201cThe Search for a Vanishing Beijing: A Guide to China\u2019s Capital Through the Ages,\u201d perhaps adds a touch of poignancy for any subsequent resident of Zhongnanhai. \u201cIn addition to being a site that preserves sites of imperial splendor,\u201d he told CNN, \u201cit also functions as a reminder to the political elite about the consequences for stepping out of line.\u201d For Aldrich, however, the Zhongnanhai compound also represents the destructive impulses of the CCP towards its adopted capital in the years after 1949, when Mao Zedong proclaimed the foundation of the People\u2019s Republic. \u201cAs a political symbol of the New China, it has been torn up, rebuilt, expanded, and revamped so many times that its connection with its elegant past has been lost,\u201d Aldrich said. Architectural changes There have been serious revisions to the architecture of Zhongnanhai since the end of imperial rule in 1912. After the last emperor abdicated the throne, China\u2019s new president Yuan Shikai granted him the right to live on the northern section of the Forbidden City \u2014 and then took Zhongnanhai to be his new administration\u2019s headquarters. The changes he made to the imperial gardens were disparaged by many of the Westerners who visited them. \u201cWhatever may be one\u2019s opinion as to whether Yuan Shikai \u2018exalted his aim\u2019 in his political career, he certainly cannot be said to have done so as builder and architect,\u201d wrote L.C. Arlington and William Lewisohn in their 1935 book \u201cIn Search of Old Peking,\u201d \u201cfor all the buildings that have been erected or restored by him are in the worst possible taste.\u201d Most notable of these changes \u2014 at least to ordinary Beijingers \u2014 was the repurposing of a two-story pavilion at the very south of the gardens. Known as the Precious Moon Tower, it had been built decades earlier by the Qianlong Emperor for a homesick lover, a Muslim woman from Xinjiang, taken to Beijing as part of the spoils of war. The concubine would gaze south from the tower toward a mock mosque and bazaar the emperor had especially constructed to assuage her longing for home. Yuan refashioned this pavilion into the main entrance to his presidential compound, and established a tall watchtower just to its east. The gate was named Xinhuamen, or the Gate of New China. Today, the structure remains coated in the same deep red that graces the walls of all Beijing\u2019s imperial buildings, with a roof of glazed yellow tiles and detailing that runs below the roofline, picked out in blue and gold. The gate is now flanked by two red banners that speak to its modern purpose as China\u2019s political and party headquarters: \u201cLong Live the Great Communist Party of China\u201d reads one; and \u201cLong Live the Invincible Mao Zedong Thought\u201d on the other. On a screen wall recessed behind the entrance way, Chinese characters written in Mao\u2019s own calligraphic style declare: \u201cServe the People.\u201d Facing out onto Beijing\u2019s main east-west thoroughfare, the gate remains the most conspicuous part of Zhongnanhai. The rest of the compound has, since 1989, been firmly off-limits to the Chinese public. Seat of power Initially, after the communist victory in China\u2019s civil war in 1949, Mao Zedong took up residence at Shuangqing Villa in Fragrant Hills, another former imperial garden to the west of Beijing. Though wary of establishing himself in the imperial heart of Beijing \u2014 it is said that he refused ever to enter the Forbidden City, for fear of being associated with the power structures of old, feudal China he had fought to overthrow \u2014 Mao ultimately moved into Zhongnanhai and, in late 1949, he set up in the\u00a0Garden of Abundant Beneficence,\u00a0a large courtyard compound favored by both the Qianlong and Kangxi emperors, where he would hold court with dignitaries\u00a0and live\u00a0until 1966. Having re-established Zhongnanhai as a center of political power in the new China, Mao set about rebuilding the compound according to his tastes. \u201cSince 1949, an assortment of new architecture styles has encroached into Zhongnanhai, with a tennis court, gymnasium, swimming pools and Western buildings topped off with Chinese eave roofs adding a discordant note that would not have been appreciated by its traditionally-minded original owners,\u201d said Aldrich. In 1966, Mao moved from the Garden of Abundant Beneficence to a specially built house beside his beloved indoor swimming pool. He often summoned officials to speak to him as he bobbed in the water \u2014 and famously received Russian leader Nikita Khrushchev at his pool during a 1958 visit. \u201cTheir interpreters had to pace alongside the edge of the pool,\u201d said Jaivin. \u201cThe Russian couldn\u2019t swim and had to wear water wings. Mao loved both swimming and putting Khrushchev in his place. Finally, Khrushchev got sick of it, and clambered out to sit on the edge, dangling his feet in the water.\u201d In the residence next door, Mao lined his rooms with bookshelves housing an extensive library of Chinese classical literature. \u201cIt was here,\u201d noted Aldrich, \u201cwith the background trappings of a scholar, that he met Nixon and Kissinger in 1972.\u201d Most subsequent leaders have preferred to keep a house outside the Zhongnanhai compound. Deng Xiaoping lived, from 1977, in a courtyard house on a nearby lane adjacent to Beihai, the \u201cNorthern Sea\u201d of central Beijing\u2019s chain of lakes. While not officially disclosed, it is believed that more contemporary leaders, including Xi Jinping and his predecessors Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, have maintained homes in an exclusive gated compound in Jade Spring Hill, sometimes called the \u201cback garden\u201d of Chinese politics, out to the city\u2019s west. Aldrich noted that those leaders and party cadres who used Zhongnanhai as their primary residence often attracted unwelcome scrutiny for their activities, particularly during years of political turbulence. \u201cIn his memoirs, Chairman Mao\u2019s physician, Li Zhisui, commented that (the complex\u2019s) residents were always under surveillance,\u201d Aldrich said. \u201cDuring the Cultural Revolution, the simple act of making a fire would bring down the wrath of the security guards on the perpetrator. It was believed that such a fire was proof that incriminating or seditious materials were being destroyed.\u201d The imperial gardens offering vistas of Zhongnanhai\u2019s lakes have, today, been filled in with dozens of gray offices and meeting halls, many of which date to 1970s, when Zhongnanhai underwent significant razing and renovation \u2014 the rebuilding was so extensive that one visitor in 1979 described the grounds resembling a construction site, with muddy roads that were impossible to walk on. The contemporary compound splits roughly in two, with the northern buildings, on the banks of the \u201cmiddle lake,\u201d used as the headquarters of China\u2019s top executive body, the State Council. It is here that foreign dignitaries are admitted. Around the \u201csouthern lake,\u201d meanwhile, are the headquarters of the CCP, including, within Qinzheng Hall (the Hall of Diligent Government), the offices of the general secretary of the party (a post currently held by Xi). Many of the most historically significant political events to occur at Zhongnanhai have taken place in Huairen Hall, or the Hall of Cherished Compassion, on the western side of the Middle Lake. The hall was added to the imperial park during the late Qing dynasty, but was then extensively remodeled by the CCP in the early 1950s to impart a more august socialist grandeur. It is a broad, imposing ceremonial hall with staggered roofs of glazed green tiles falling in curved lines to upturned corners; the facade of austere grey brick is interrupted by red wooden pillars, windows and doors. The building\u2019s capacious interior houses a large auditorium, as well as numerous smaller meeting rooms. The hall has, for decades, served as the main meeting place for China\u2019s Politburo, the party\u2019s decision-making body usually comprising about two dozen members. On occasion, it has also hosted the Politburo\u2019s Standing Committee, the core of China\u2019s political elite, (the power of both bodies has notably dwindled in the era of Xi), though they most commonly meet in Qinzheng Hall, close to the general secretary\u2019s office. During the tumult of the Cultural Revolution vital discussions and debates occurred at Huairen Hall, and, in the months after its conclusion, it was there that three of the so-called Gang of Four \u2014 the political faction that included Mao\u2019s wife held responsible for the worst excesses of the era \u2014 were arrested, tricked into attending a meeting they thought was about the publication of the fifth volume of Mao\u2019s Selected Works. In April 1989, former party head Hu Yaobang suffered a heart-attack during a Politburo meeting at Huairen; his death a week later would trigger the Tiananmen Square protests that the government forcibly cracked down on in early June of that year. However, the compound hasn\u2019t always been so forbidden for the masses following the collapse of China\u2019s imperial dynasty. In the late 1920s, it became a park, with tourists allowed to boat on and swim in the lakes, while in the 1980s, the public could access some of its scenic and historical spots, including\u00a0Mao\u2019s\u00a0former residence, on\u00a0organized weekend tours.\u00a0Even early in 1989, a journalist for the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0was able to casually\u00a0drive\u00a0a senior official into the compound and drop him off inside.\u00a0During a period of warmer US and China relations in 2011, former Chinese president\u00a0Hu Jintao\u00a0invited\u00a0a group of American high school students to Zhongnanhai. Modern security concerns Today, Zhongnanhai is more closely-guarded than ever, though the inexorable development of the city has caused problems in maintaining the compound\u2019s secrecy. When an annex to the nearby Beijing Hotel was built in\u00a01973, authorities were panicked by the realization that from its upper floors one could quite easily see \u2013 and potentially target a sniper rifle \u2013 into Zhongnanhai. A building was hastily erected on the western edge of the Forbidden City to restrict this view. Likewise in 2018, when Beijing\u2019s new tallest building was\u00a0completed\u00a0\u2013 the 528-meter Citic tower, better known as the \u201cZun\u201d \u2013 the country\u2019s national security apparatus reportedly requisitioned the top floors amid fears that visitors or occupants might be able to spy into the compound. Beijing authorities did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on the security situation at the time. Zhongnanhai\u2019s entrance, Xinhuamen, has also been the site of repeated demonstrations in recent decades; in 1989, it was a gathering point for students taking part in the Tiananmen protests, whilst in 1999, more than 10,000 members of the since-banned Falun Gong gathered on the sidewalks near Zhongnanhai to protest their treatment at the hands of the government. So, while Zhongnanhai is sometimes compared to the White House, Aldrich argues that the paranoia with which the compound is today guarded makes it more like the imperial palace of centuries past: \u201cSince ordinary people are not allowed to enter Zhongnanhai, it is probably more appropriate to describe it as a \u2018New Forbidden City\u2019 for China\u2019s ruling elite rather than a place with a personal political resonance for the average citizen,\u201d he said. \u201cHeck, even the Kremlin is open to tourists!\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/style/zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_28_climate_energy-grid-modernization-biden", "text": "The White House on Tuesday will announce steps to modernize a major roadblock to the clean energy transformation: America\u2019s aging electrical infrastructure. The new initiative between the feds and 21 states aims to make faster fixes and improvements to the grid, committing to build a bigger and more modern grid as part of a larger effort to reduce power outages and increase electrical transmission capacity \u2013 a massive hurdle to getting more clean energy on the grid and reducing the planet-warming pollution causing the climate crisis. The announcement comes on the same day that hundreds of thousands of customers lost power in Texas during destructive storms Tuesday morning, following a deadly holiday weekend of severe weather across the South and Midwest. Weather-related power outages are on the rise as stronger storms put more pressure on outdated infrastructure, a recent report from nonprofit research group Climate Central found. The White House and Department of Energy will make the announcement at a\u00a0summit for states, industry groups and electric regulators. White House national climate adviser Ali Zaidi called the new initiative \u201cunprecedented\u201d and said it will \u201cdrive grid adaptation quickly and cost-effectively.\u201d \u201cWe are investing tens of billions \u2014 the most significant public investment in a generation \u2014 to strengthen our grid to prevent power outages in the face of extreme weather, bolster US energy security, and drive innovation,\u201d Zaidi said in a statement. The US currently has a major clean energy problem: There is more electricity from solar power alone waiting to get on the grid than the entire amount of energy currently on the grid. To combat the climate crisis and increase the amount of cheap energy from clean sources like wind and solar, the US needs more modern high-voltage transmission lines. And it\u2019s coming at a critical time; while electricity demand in the US has remained relatively flat over the past few decades, it is set to spike in the coming years due to the dramatic rise in data centers and AI, as well as demand from electric vehicles. As part of the initiative, the federal government will provide technical assistance and make sure states can apply for federal money and loans to build more transmission lines. And leaders from states including Pennsylvania, Kentucky, New York and Arizona are committing to modernize their transmission, leaning on state legislatures and governors to pass policy enhancing the grid and using new conductors that can carry more electricity. Since the Inflation Reduction Act passed nearly two years ago, Congress hasn\u2019t been able to agree on a bill to increase electrical transmission. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer recently told reporters it was highly unlikely to get accomplished before the 2024 election. In lieu of action from Congress, the Biden administration has tried to spur action on its own. It\u2019s launched other grid initiatives, working with states and private companies in an effort to upgrade 100,000 miles of existing transmission lines so they\u2019ll be able to carry more power using so-called reconductoring \u2013 swapping high-voltage lines, which carry more electrical capacity, onto already existing towers. The three-member Federal Energy Regulatory Commission recently voted to approve a new rule that will bring major reforms to the nation\u2019s aging electrical grid. It will compel utilities and grid operators to proactively plan to build regional electrical transmission and is\u00a0a step toward solving the problem of vast amounts of clean energy being stuck in a backlog, unable to get on a grid too small to handle it. Rob Gramlich, CEO of Grid Strategies, told CNN planning is a key aspect to the grid. \u201cYou\u2019re always better off if you proactively plan and build at the right scale,\u201d Gramlich said. \u201cIt turns out we really have not been doing proactive transmission planning.\u201d After the recent vote, FERC chairman Willie Phillips called the vote the \u201cmost significant FERC action on transmission policy in more than a decade\u201d and said it would give a significant boost to building out the grid at a time when it\u2019s being tested by extreme weather and increasing power demand from AI, data centers and electric vehicles. \u201cOur country\u2019s aging grid is being tested in ways that we\u2019ve never seen before,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cWithout significant action now, we won\u2019t be able to keep the lights on in the face of increasing demand, extreme weather and new technologies.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/climate/energy-grid-modernization-biden/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "world"}}

In a speech celebrating US-Mexico cooperation on the case, US President Joe Biden on Saturday hailed the extradition of El Nini \u2013 also known as N\u00e9stor Isidro P\u00e9rez Salas \u2013 as \u201ca good day for justice.\u201d \u201cEl Nini played a prominent role in the notorious Sinaloa cartel, one of the deadliest drug trafficking enterprises in the world. The United States has charged him for his role in illicit fentanyl trafficking and for murdering, torturing, and kidnapping numerous rivals, witnesses, and others,\u201d Biden said, thanking Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador. \u201cOur governments will continue to work together to attack the fentanyl and synthetic drug epidemic that is killing so many people in our homelands and globally, and to bring to justice the criminals and organizations producing, smuggling, and selling these lethal poisons in both of our countries,\u201d he added. According to the US Department of Justice, N\u00e9stor Isidro P\u00e9rez Salas \u201cwas one of the Sinaloa cartel\u2019s lead sicarios, or assassins\u201d and was involved in the \u201cproduction and sale of fentanyl\u201d in the United States.

During recent military drills with Cambodia, China\u2019s military showed off a robot dog with an automatic rifle mounted on its back, essentially turning man\u2019s best (electronic) friend into a killing machine. \u201cIt can serve as a new member in our urban combat operations, replacing our (human) members to conduct reconnaissance and identify (the) enemy and strike the target,\u201d a soldier identified as Chen Wei says in a video from state broadcaster CCTV. The two-minute video made during the China-Cambodia \u201cGolden Dragon 2024\u201d exercise also shows the robot dog walking, hopping, lying down and moving backwards under the control of a remote operator. In one drill, the rifle-firing robot leads an infantry unit into a simulated building.

A CCTV video from last year also highlighted China\u2019s rifle-armed electronic canines in a joint exercise involving the Chinese, Cambodian, Lao, Malaysian, Thai and Vietnamese militaries held in China last November. In 2020, the US Air Force demonstrated how it used robotic dogs as one link in its Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS), which uses artificial intelligence and rapid data analytics to detect and counter threats to US military assets. And since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, drones have become commonplace on the battlefield, on the land, sea and air, with cheap remotely controlled vehicles able to knock out sophisticated military machines like tanks and even warships. The lethal abilities of drones seen on the Ukraine battlefields has shown them to be great equalizers, enabling military forces with small defense budgets to compete with substantially better armed and funded enemies. China is one of the world\u2019s leading drone exporters, but last year its Commerce Ministry placed export controls on drone technology, citing the need to \u201csafeguard national security and interests.\u201d Nevertheless, the robotic dogs seem to be getting plenty of publicity for the People\u2019s Liberation Army. And the dogs have been popping up on China\u2019s heavily regulated social media for at least a year. According to the state-run Global Times, the presence of the robotic dogs at exercises with foreign militaries indicates an advanced stage of development. \u201cUsually, a new equipment will not be brought into a joint exercise with another country, so the robot dogs must have reached a certain level of technical maturity,\u201d Global Times quoted an unnamed expert as saying.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/china/china-military-rifle-toting-robot-dogs-intl-hnk-ml/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_28_middleeast_israeli-tanks-advance-central-rafah-gaza-intl", "text": "Israeli military tanks were seen in central Rafah on Tuesday for the first time since the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) entered Gaza\u2019s southernmost city earlier this month, two eyewitnesses told CNN. The move comes two days after an Israeli strike on a camp in Gaza\u2019s southernmost city killed dozens of displaced Palestinians on Sunday and amid a push by the international community to stop its assault on the city. Two further Israeli attacks in Rafah killed at least 29\u00a0Palestinians on Tuesday,\u00a0according to authorities in Gaza. Alaa Abu Ibrahim, a Rafah resident, told CNN that Israeli tanks were seen at the Al Awda roundabout in the center of the city. Another resident, Salma AlKadoomi, said she saw armored vehicles in the downtown area near the Abu Hashem building. \u201cThese vehicles advanced in the middle of the night,\u201d AlKadoomi told CNN. Asked about reports of tanks advancing in the city, IDF spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said at a media briefing on Tuesday that the military is operating in Rafah in a \u201ctargeted\u201d and \u201cprecise\u201d way. \u201cThere are still Hamas battalions in Rafah. A couple of days ago launchers from Rafah fired (rockets) to Tel Aviv. Millions of people went into bomb shelters,\u201d he said. Israel began a limited ground operation in Rafah on May 7, crossing the Philadelphi Corridor \u2013 a 14-kilometer (about 8.7-mile) long buffer zone on the Egypt-Gaza border \u2013 and seizing the Palestinian side of the border with Egypt. \u201cToday and the day before we\u2019ve again detected tunnels along the Philadelphi Corridor, those are tunnels going to Sinai,\u201d Hagari said, adding that the IDF is demolishing the tunnels into Sinai, and communicating with the Egyptian government about it. Egypt has strongly opposed the operation at its border. On Monday, an Egyptian security personnel was killed on the border with Gaza in a shooting that involved Egyptian and Israeli soldiers. Egypt\u2019s state-affiliated Al-Qahera News outlet said that \u201cPalestinian resistance\u201d fighters were also involved. Some 1.3 million Palestinians were sheltering in Rafah before Israel began its operation there. Around 1 million have fled the city since, according to UN figures. The Biden administration has warned against a large-scale ground invasion in Rafah unless the wellbeing of civilians can be guaranteed. US President Joe Biden warned in an interview with CNN this month that he would halt shipments of American weapons to Israel should it launch a major invasion of Rafah. US national security adviser Jake Sullivan however said last week that he had detected \u201crefinements\u201d to Israel\u2019s plan, which he said was now more \u201ctargeted and limited\u201d in scale. Displacement camps hit again: Palestinian officials News of the tanks\u2019 movement came as Palestinian officials said two fresh Israeli strikes Tuesday had killed 29 people \u2013 at least eight at the Tal al-Sultan camp and 21 at a camp\u00a0in Al-Mawasi, though the IDF has denied striking a humanitarian area in Al-Mawasi. The first strike hit three tents at Tal al-Sultan at around 3 a.m. local time, according to residents and a CNN stringer in Rafah. At least eight people were\u00a0killed and transferred to a field hospital in Tal Al-Sultan camp, according to the Emergency Committee of the Rafah Governorate. CNN has reached out to the IDF for comment on the strike at Tal al-Sultan. The Tal al-Sultan camp is\u00a0located next to a United Nations warehouse, whose walls were damaged from the strike, according to a video from a CNN stringer on the ground.\u00a0The camp hit on Tuesday is approximately 150 meters from another displacement\u00a0camp where an Israeli strike and ensuing fire on Sunday killed at least 45 people. Video from CNN\u2019s stringer in Tal al-Sultan shows displaced people dismantling their makeshift living arrangements, gathering their belongings and evacuating the area on trucks and donkey carts. According to Gaza\u2019s Ministry of Health, a second strike Tuesday afternoon local time hit\u00a0a displacement camp\u00a0in the southern coastal town of Al-Mawasi, killing at least 21 people, including 13 women, and injuring at least 64 people with 10 in critical condition. However, the Israeli military has denied striking a humanitarian area in Al-Mawasi. It told CNN in a statement: \u201cContrary to the reports from the last few hours, the IDF did not strike in the humanitarian area in Al-Mawasi.\u201d CNN has followed up, asking if the IDF has struck elsewhere in Al-Mawasi, such as the UN warehouse that is in the vicinity of the camp, but has not received a reply. The southern coastal town of Al-Mawasi is north of Rafah and is supposedly a \u201csafe zone.\u201d In early May, the Israeli military ordered people in eastern Rafah to \u201cimmediately head to the expanded humanitarian area in Al-Mawasi,\u201d as it stepped up its operations in the southern Gazan city. The Al-Mawasi camp was already crowded with displaced people before civilians in Rafah were ordered to move there. The UN has said it is not \u201cquite suitable\u201d for habitation. Graphic videos obtained by CNN show several dead bodies lying on sand covered in bloodied blankets with dozens of people shrieking and gathering around them. Children are seen crying next to the bodies of women whose faces are covered in blood. Israeli investigation Sunday\u2019s Israeli strike on the camp sheltering Palestinians in Rafah killed 45 people and injured another 200, sparking an international outcry. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday said the civilian casualties were \u201ca tragic error.\u201d Israel launched an investigation into the event, and on Tuesday the IDF claimed the deadly fire at the camp could not have been caused solely by the weaponry used by Israel. \u201cOur munitions alone could not have ignited a fire of this size. Our investigation seeks to determine what may have caused such a large fire to ignite,\u201d Hagari said. \u201cWe are looking into all possibilities, including the option that weapons stored in a compound next to our target, which we did not know of, may have ignited as a result of this strike.\u201d He showed aerial footage of a strike on a structure in which he said senior Hamas commanders were meeting and\u00a0said that the military used two munitions with 17-kilogram (37 lbs) warheads.\u00a0\u201cThis is the smallest munitions that our jets could use.\u201d \u201cWe are working to verify the cause of the fire, it is still too early to be determined,\u201d Hagari said.\u00a0\u201cEven when we do find the cause of the fire that erupted it won\u2019t make this situation any less tragic.\u201d Israel\u2019s advance deeper into Rafah comes despite the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ordering it to \u201cimmediately halt\u201d its military operation there. The UN and some of Israel\u2019s European allies have called on it to abide by the ICJ\u2019s order, saying it is binding.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/middleeast/israeli-tanks-advance-central-rafah-gaza-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "world"}}

The attack occurred in Kuchi village, Munya district, in Niger state, beginning at about 5:30 p.m. on Friday and lasting until 4:00 a.m. Saturday, according to district official Aminu Abdulhamid Najume. Niger state, which borders Nigeria\u2019s capital Abuja, has experienced repeated kidnappings for ransom by armed groups, including mass abductions, in recent years. Najume reported that about 300 gunmen arrived on motorbikes and stayed for several hours, making themselves at home before leaving with the abductees. \u201cThey made a fire to curb the cold because it was raining throughout that day,\u201d Najume said. \u201cThey cooked and made tea; they made Indomie (instant noodles) and spaghetti.\u201d Some of those killed were members of a local vigilante group who confronted the attackers but were overpowered. Najume added that security forces had not yet started rescue operations. \u201cThe police visited Kuchi yesterday [Sunday] and left, nothing else.\u201d A spokesperson for the Niger State Police Command did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment. \u201cThis is not the first or second time Kuchi village has been attacked. This is the fifth time,\u201d Najume said, noting that the area frequently suffers from kidnappings for ransom. The kidnappers have not yet made any demands regarding the latest abduction, he said. Amnesty International said in a post\u00a0on social media platform X on Sunday that it was \u201cdeeply concerned by the abduction,\u201d criticizing Nigerian authorities for leaving \u201crural communities at the mercy of gunmen.\u201d \u201cSince 2021, gunmen have been consistently attacking Kuchi village and raping women and girls in their matrimonial homes,\u201d the agency stated. \u201cThe invasion of the village by the gunmen is yet another indication of the Nigerian authorities\u2019 utter failure to protect lives,\u201d Amnesty added. Nigeria\u2019s security forces have struggled for years to control insurgent groups in the north of the country. The Kuchi abduction comes two months after 21 people, including a newlywed, were killed when gunmen described locally as \u2018bandits\u2019 stormed a market in Rafi, another affected district in Niger. At least 137 schoolchildren were kidnapped earlier in March in Niger\u2019s neighboring Kaduna state but were later released after the kidnappers made an initial demand of 1 billion naira (over $675,000) and threatened to kill them all if their demands were not met.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/27/africa/gunmen-kidnap-scores-in-nigeria-deadly-raid-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "travel_chaise-longue-double-level-airplane-seat-premium", "text": "It\u2019s the airplane seat design that launched a thousand memes, kickstarted a media storm and became a byword for innovation in aviation, for better or for worse. And now the double-level airplane seat is back \u2013 only this time, with a twist. Designer Alejandro N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vicente remains a fervent believer that two-level seating is the future of flying. He\u2019s spent his twenties \u2013 all five years of them so far \u2013 perfecting his vision for economy class dual-level seating. Now he\u2019s focused on the next iteration of his dream: a luxury version for first-class and business-class passengers. \u201cNow that we know economy works, and now that\u2019s moving forward, we thought, \u2018Why not go to the other end of the cabin and do a business-class/first-class hybrid?\u2019 says N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vicente, speaking to CNN Travel at the Aircraft Interiors Expo in Hamburg, Germany, one of the world\u2019s biggest aviation shows, where he\u2019s showcasing the latest iteration of his design. The crux of N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vicente\u2019s vision remains the same: removing the overhead locker to create two levels of airplane seating in one cabin \u2013 with one passenger seated directly below another. But while the economy class concept imagines three seats on the top and bottom rows, this new concept, called \u201celevated class,\u201d envisages just one seat on the bottom row, and two on the top in a couch-style configuration. Each row is designed to be secluded, private and include the luxury trappings of elite travel \u2013 lie-flat bed, privacy and copious leg room. The goal, according to N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vicente? \u201cTo make more space for more seats in the airplane. But also give the passengers an even better experience than they get today in business or first class.\u201d \u2018No such thing as bad publicity\u2019 This is N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vicente\u2019s third time showcasing his vision at AIX in Hamburg. Following CNN Travel exclusives in 2022 and 2023, the economy iteration of his design attracted a lot of attention, chatter and controversy. On late-night chat shows and message boards alike, would-be passengers debated fears of claustrophobia, questions about safety and accessibility \u2013 and just generally recoiled at the idea of being in close physical proximity to another traveler. But N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vicente remains unperturbed by criticism, a steadfast believer in the old adage that \u201cthere\u2019s no such thing as bad publicity.\u201d \u201cMost of the things that changed the world are normally from radical people that come with a crazy idea \u2013 like Steve Jobs with the iPhone,\u201d says N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vicente. A lot of the comments were in jest, he suggests, rather than serious or constructive criticism. They were mostly about what would happen if passengers passed wind. And while N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vicente appreciates that the average \u201cperson on the street,\u201d might think he\u2019s \u201ccrazy\u201d \u2013 within the aviation industry, his reputation is growing. N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vicente won\u2019t name any names, but he says a handful of \u201cbig players\u201d are seriously interested in developing the economy concept (that\u2019s why there\u2019s no economy prototype on display at this year\u2019s AIX \u2013 N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vicente says any further development will happen behind closed doors). Meanwhile N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vicente and his business partner and girlfriend Clara Service Soto are regularly approached with \u201cdream job\u201d offers from airlines and seat manufacturers (all turned down \u2013 they\u2019re committed to making the original vision a reality). And at this \u2013 his third Aircraft Interiors Expo \u2013 N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vicente\u2019s latest prototype neighbors some of the biggest players in the airplane seat world \u2013 Recaro and Safran. Plus, Chaise Longue is now sponsored by Tapis \u2013 a company that supplies high-quality fabrics for aircraft interiors \u2013 and this year\u2019s prototype is kitted out in luxury materials. \u201cWe\u2019re talking to the biggest players,\u201d says N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vicente.\u201dThey know this is going to happen sooner or later.\u201d First class travel While his detractors suggest his sole goal is to make airlines more money and cram more seats on planes, N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vicente insists he\u2019s always been on a quest for \u201cmore comfort.\u201d While N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vicente is now on his way to becoming an aviation insider, Chaise Longue is still a start-up, run by Nunez Vicente and Service Soto with help from their supportive families. And it\u2019s not long since N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vicente first entered the industry as a 21-year-old student \u2013 the original Chaise Longue was simply a college project inspired by a slew of uncomfortable economy flights. At 6 feet 2 inches (1.88 meters), N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vicente was used to cramped airplane journeys in which he struggled for legroom and struggled to sleep. He figured by removing the seat row directly in front, and putting it on top instead, travelers could stretch out their legs in front of them and enjoy more leg room. The fact this concept could also \u201cgive the airline a new revenue stream or a new way to make more money out of those passengers or put more seats in\u201d is a bonus \u2013 although N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vicente is aware it\u2019s an attractive bonus for airlines. He\u2019s also aware that airlines historically invest money in premium products \u2013 not economy class. It\u2019s not for nothing that every airline\u2019s economy class is more or less identical, whereas business class and first class come in all sorts of swanky forms \u2013 from Singapore Airlines\u2019 double bed suite in the sky to Emirates\u2019 virtual reality windows.\u00a0 Enter Chaise Longue\u2019s \u201celevated class\u201d which N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vicente calls a \u201cfirst-class experience with a business-class layout.\u201d It\u2019s part of N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vicente\u2019s quest to \u201crevolutionize the entire aircraft\u201d \u2013 first economy, now the premier cabins. He\u2019s also trying to move away from the \u201cdouble decker\u201d and \u201cdouble level\u201d label, suggesting the concept could be referred to as \u201c3D seating.\u201d While N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vicente envisages a future where dual level seating exists throughout the aircraft, he\u2019s not proposing airlines get rid of regular seats altogether. He imagines the Chaise Longue seats in the middle of each cabin, flanked by regular seating on either side. Testing out the concept At AIX 2024, CNN Travel was the first to test out the newest Chaise Longue prototype. It\u2019s smaller than last year\u2019s prototype \u2013 only three seats on display versus last year\u2019s twelve. At first glance, the concept seems more conventional \u2013 although the dual level concept remains integral to the design and strikingly different from anything you\u2019re currently experiencing on an aircraft. First up: trialing the lower level. The aim for this bottom seat, says N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vicente, was to create \u201ca fully private space that can be completely enclosed all the way from the top to the bottom.\u201d It\u2019s a spacious seat that converts into a lie-flat bed \u2013 and like the economy iteration, there\u2019s a roomy footwell allowing you to stretch out your legs in front of you underneath the upper level. While last year\u2019s economy prototype\u2019s lower level felt pretty claustrophobic \u2013 this concept leans more towards secluded and private than narrow and oppressive. Of course, it\u2019s hard to actually judge how you\u2019d actually feel knowing someone was seated directly above you \u2013 but the spaciousness and seclusion of having your own compartment makes it seem like it\u2019d be pretty easy to switch off and get some sleep on a long-haul flight. There\u2019s also less of a sense of the upper level being directly in your eyeline \u2013 instead, there\u2019s a wall with space for a TV screen, which is a good couple of meters away. The Chaise Longue concept involves eradicating the overhead lockers \u2013 a concept which seems less outrageous in a premium class, where alternative storage areas like closets are more common. In N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vicente\u2019s design, there\u2019s plenty of space underneath the seat and underneath the footwell to store large suitcases. Next up, the upper level \u2013 which offers an extra-wide seat, lie-flat seat that could accommodate one passenger looking for a bit more space, or two passengers who are happy getting cozy. It\u2019s a couch-style set-up that could be ideal for travelers traveling with a plus-one. \u201cWe wanted to make the experience as homey as possible,\u201d says N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vicente of this upper level. \u201cThe amount of real estate that you\u2019re getting is so much bigger than the one you would get in any business or first class.\u201d N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vicente is aware the upper level, which is reached by walking up steps, won\u2019t be appropriate for some passengers, but says the spacious lower level has been designed to be accessible to wheelchair users, anyone with reduced mobility and people traveling with service animals. He also insists the upper level would be safe, despite the proximity to the ceiling, and encourages passengers to wear seatbelts. It\u2019s hard to judge whether the top or bottom level seat is more appealing. From trialing both options, it seems like the lower level might be more suitable for sleeping on a long-haul flight, while the top level could be more appealing for a daytime flight spent watching movies and relaxing on the coach-style seat. Still, some might argue neither seat is as appealing as a straightforward, swanky first-class or business-class suite in a regular cabin configuration \u2013 where all the seats remain on one level. As a designer, N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vicente says he would \u201cnever put a price\u201d on either seat row, suggesting that\u2019s an airline\u2019s job. Awaiting feedback N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vicente is excited to get feedback from airlines at AIX (\u201cup to 85% of the seat is customizable,\u201d he says, and any airline who invested in the product could put their own stamp on the design). He knows the Chaise Longue\u2019s quest for airworthiness might be a long road, but he\u2019s confident it could be a reality one day \u2013 and airline feedback is integral to that. He\u2019s still passionate about improving the experience for economy flyers, and says even if the \u201celevated class\u201d Chaise Longue makes it off the ground first, he\u2019ll continue to work to make the economy class a reality. He\u2019s also curious to hear what the general public has to say on the concept too. He hopes this premium version will be less maligned, but admits that you never do know. \u201cWe will put our reputation on the line, again, and see how it turns out,\u201d he says. \u201cEvery year that passes we are putting our reputation, our name in the aviation industry on the line to see if we can really make a change.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/chaise-longue-double-level-airplane-seat-premium/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_27_weather_memorial-day-weekend-forecast-monday", "text": "Millions in the East are in the path of severe weather on Memorial Day after intense and deadly storms ravaged a large area of the central United States over the weekend. Destructive thunderstorms and tornadoes were responsible for at least 23 deaths over the long weekend, including four children, in parts of Kentucky, Arkansas, Texas, Oklahoma and Alabama. The storms killed 15 in Arkansas and Texas alone. Another five people died in Kentucky. LIVE UPDATES: At least 23 killed in tornado-spawning storms sweeping central US Sunday was the busiest severe weather day of the year so far, with more than 600 reports of storm damage across at least 20 states, including tornadoes, wind gusts in excess of 75 mph and hail the size of softballs. Storms turned buildings into piles of rubble, damaged cars and brought down power lines. More than 450,000 homes and businesses in the central, southern and eastern US still were without power in the wake of weekend storms Monday afternoon, according to PowerOutage.us. Harsh storms pummeled parts of Kentucky Sunday night and inflicted damage on some communities, prompting Gov. Andy Beshear to issue a state of emergency early Monday. Phone lines in the Bowling Green area were knocked out, leading police to set up alternate emergency numbers for those who needed help. The National Weather Service office in Paducah, Kentucky, is sending out at least two storm survey teams Monday to assess damage, the office said. Five storm-related deaths have been reported in the state \u2013 one in Hardin County, one in Hopkins County, one in Caldwell County, one in Mercer County and one about 70 miles away in Louisville. Another person is \u201cfighting for their life,\u201d Beshear said in a Monday news conference. Two people were killed and more than 20 others were injured as a result of storms in Oklahoma over the weekend, officials said. A tornado of at least EF3 strength \u2013 meaning it was capable of gusts between 136 mph and 165 mph \u2013 struck Claremore, Oklahoma, on Saturday night, the National Weather Service said. Twenty-three people were injured there, officials said. The twister also tore through Will Rogers Downs, a horse-racing facility outside Claremore, injuring several horses and requiring three to be euthanized, according to Joe Lucas, a spokesperson for the state\u2019s Thoroughbred Racing Association. Two people were killed as a result of storms in the nearby city of Pryor, officials said. Severe thunderstorm threat shifts to East More than 70 million people from the South to the Northeast are under a level 2 of 5 risk of severe thunderstorms Monday. Severe thunderstorms will rumble to life through Monday evening in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic, including a vast section of the I-95 corridor. Storms in the regions could unload damaging wind gusts, hail and tornadoes. Tornadoes are possible in any severe storms that develop in the East Monday, but areas from eastern North Carolina to eastern Pennsylvania and western New Jersey are at a slightly increased risk. Richmond, Virginia, DC, Baltimore and Philadelphia are just a few cities that could contend with tornadoes. Storms will also unload drenching rainfall which could lead to flooding, especially in low-lying or urban areas. A level 2 of 4 risk of excessive rainfall is in place for parts of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware and Maryland. Severe thunderstorms in the East will come to an end Monday night after tracking offshore and out into the Atlantic Ocean. Isolated severe thunderstorms could bubble up later Monday afternoon and evening in parts of the southern Plains. A level 2 of 5 risk of severe thunderstorms is in place in north-central Texas and includes the Dallas-Fort Worth metro. Large hail and damaging wind gusts are the main threats with any storms in the area, but a tornado is also possible. High temperatures scorch parts of the South High temperatures and an early season heat wave are making for a sweltering Memorial Day holiday across parts of southern Texas, the central Gulf Coast and southern Florida. Excessive heat warnings are in effect through Monday evening for parts of Texas while heat advisories stretch from Texas to Mississippi. Houston; New Orleans; Miami; Mobile, Alabama; Tampa, Florida; and Charleston, South Carolina, are some areas experiencing extreme warmth Monday. Air temperatures in some locations were rising to near-record highs mid-afternoon Monday, with heat index readings exceeding 110 degrees from Texas to southern Louisiana. The heat index \u2013 a measure of how the body actually feels when it\u2019s hot out \u2013 was between 110 and 115 degrees in parts of the Houston metro Monday afternoon. It broke into the low 120s near Texas\u2019 border with Mexico. The heat index soared to at least 108 degrees in New Orleans and flirted with the triple-digit mark in Mobile, Alabama. Nightfall may not bring relief in some areas. Overnight low temperature are expected to be 10 to 15 degrees above normal and could be record-warm in dozens of locations. Such extreme, prolonged heat raises the risk of heat illness such as heat stroke, particularly for vulnerable groups such as children, adults with underlying health conditions, pregnant women and outdoor workers. The risks of excessive heat \u2013 the most deadly form of extreme weather \u2013 are becoming more widespread as human-driven climate change drives warming global temperatures. During the warm season last year, heat-related illnesses accounted for a 20% larger share of emergency department visits than they did in the five previous seasons.

{"id": "2024_05_28_weather_texas-southern-plains-storm-forecast-tuesday", "text": "At least one person has been killed and more than 700,000 customers in Texas remained without power Tuesday evening as powerful storms delivered another round of violent weather to a state still reeling from an almost unrelenting parade of destructive and deadly storms in recent weeks. Storms unloaded hurricane-force wind gusts across the Dallas area Tuesday and later tore through Houston in the afternoon, where the city\u2019s George Bush Intercontinental Airport recorded a wind gust of 75 mph. Roughly 40 miles northwest of Houston, one person died after a house under construction collapsed in a subdivision in Magnolia, the city\u2019s fire officials said. The victim \u2013 described as a \u201cjuvenile male\u201d by the Magnolia Fire Department \u2013 was removed from a debris pile by firefighters and pronounced dead. Magnolia Fire Department Division Chief Jason Herrman confirmed to CNN the home\u2019s collapse was related to a Tuesday thunderstorm with \u201csignificant winds.\u201d Videos captured across Houston and Dallas communities revealed scenes of disaster and flooding Tuesday. Footage from north Dallas obtained by CNN showed multiple cars stranded in a flooded roadway, surrounded by frequent lightning as the rain continued. In other communities, powerful winds ripped out trees and forced them onto homes and knocked down neighborhood fences, leaving communities in disarray. The power outages started to ramp up early Tuesday morning in the Dallas area, then extended south with the storms as they roared across the state, according to PowerOutage.us. Hundreds of thousands of outages were in Dallas County, where officials issued a disaster declaration and warned outages could last for days. READ: White House announcing action to modernize electric grid and pave the way for fewer outages These storms have arrived even as some residents are still mourning at least seven people killed in the state during\u00a0violent storms over Memorial Day weekend. In total, at least two dozen people, including four children, were killed across six states as storms hit the central US over the holiday period, and several communities are grappling with significant losses of homes and businesses. Sunday was the busiest severe weather day of the year so far, with more than 600 reports of strong winds or hail across more than 20 states, including gusts over 75 mph and hail the size of softballs. Twenty-six tornado reports also were made in 10 states. Storms turned homes and businesses into piles of rubble, flung cars and brought down power lines. Parts of Texas and extreme western Louisiana face Tuesday\u2019s most serious threat of severe weather. Large hail, lightning and wind gusts as strong as 80 mph are the main threats with any storm. A few tornadoes may also occur, according to the National Weather Service. And some areas rocked by winds, storms and hail earlier Tuesday were still under threat into the night: A tornado watch was in effect for parts of northwest Texas until 9 p.m. CT; in the southwest portion of the state, a severe thunderstorm watch was in effect until 9 p.m.; and two other severe thunderstorm watches were in effect across the Texas panhandle up through the Colorado and Kansas border. The weather also spelled misery for hundreds of travelers. More than 600 flights flying in and out of the Dallas Fort Worth International Airport and the Dallas Love Field Airport have been canceled \u2013 and more than 900 flights in and out of the two airports have been delayed, according to FlightAware data. More than 75 flights in and out of Houston\u2019s William P. Hobby Airport and George Bush Intercontinental Airport have been canceled, while more than 530 have been delayed. Power outages could last days in Dallas It could take days to fully restore power in the Dallas-Fort Worth area after violent storms unleashed hurricane-force wind gusts Tuesday morning. Dallas is the second major Texas city to have critical power infrastructure damaged by severe weather in less than two weeks. \u201cThis, unfortunately, will be a multi-day power outage situation, similar to the one that (occurred) in Harris County and Houston,\u201d Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins cautioned during a news conference Tuesday. A derecho and tornado in mid-May blasted 100 mph wind gusts through the Houston metro, killing multiple people and knocking out power for days. The full extent of damage to power infrastructure in the Dallas area is still being assessed, but the current prognosis is concerning, according to Grant Cruise, a spokesperson for Oncor \u2014 the state\u2019s largest utility company. \u201cWe did have a significant number of downed lines because of this weather event,\u201d Cruise said during Tuesday\u2019s news conference. \u201cIn many cases it\u2019s not going to be simple repairs, we\u2019re looking at complete reconstruction for parts of our area.\u201d The storm damage prompted Jenkins to issue a disaster declaration for Dallas County. The outages come as some Texans head to the polls Tuesday for primary runoff elections. More than a third of Dallas County\u2019s polling places were without power Tuesday afternoon, according to Jenkins. Summerlike heat will ease in Texas this week, but those left without power or a reliable way to cool down could still face the risk of dangerous heat stroke or heat exhaustion.

At the same time, Rivers State Governor Siminalayi Fubara has highlighted the state\u2019s efforts to create a more vibrant, investment-friendly environment, aiming to reassure investors of the requisite return on their investments. Located in the Niger Delta region, Rivers State is a key oil-producing area in Nigeria. It hosts several major oil companies and boasts several oil wells. Despite its vast oil wealth, the region has faced oil theft and sabotage over the years and suffers from a high unemployment rate. Building an investor\u2019s paradise However, Fubara emphasized that his administration is taking measures to re-industrialize the state and bring back numerous production factories that had shut down operations. During the two-day Rivers State Economic and Investment Summit (RSEIS), themed \u201cRivers Emerge: Advancing Pathways to Economic Growth and Sustainability,\u201d held at the Dr. Obi Wali International Conference Centre in Port Harcourt, Sanusi delivered a keynote address where he called for better management of the state\u2019s resources. \u201cWith rich abundant land, abundant resources, and natural resources, as well as the strategic location of the state, Rivers can be one of the best investors paradises, not just in Nigeria but in West Africa if the right things can be done,\u201d Sanusi said. The Emir of Kano stressed that a prosperous future relies on the capacity of state institutions and the quality and skills of its population. He drew comparisons with countries like Japan, Singapore, Germany, Australia, and Rwanda, which have thrived without significant natural resources, attributing their success to good governance, innovation, and education. Fubara highlighted the various measures taken to make Rivers State a destination for all categories of investors. \u201cWe have already implemented certain policy initiatives and reforms, including the prompt allocation and issuance of land titles and certificates of occupancy to prospective investors and a moratorium on State taxes and levies on new businesses. We are also working on the harmonization of state and local government taxes to eliminate double taxation and the imposition of multiple levies on investors,\u201d he said. Fubara also announced a N4 billion (over $2.7 million)\u00a0matching fund loan scheme with the Bank of Industry Limited for small, micro, and medium-scale businesses to drive financial inclusion and enhance the growth and development of these businesses. \u2018Oil is not a curse, the curse is the leaders\u2019 Sanusi pointed out that while countries like Russia, the UAE, and Norway have benefitted from their natural resources, their success also hinges on visionary governance and strong institutions. He argued that resources can be both a blessing and a curse, depending on leadership. \u201cOil is not a curse; the curse is the leaders we have had,\u201d he said. Fubara detailed further initiatives, including providing hundreds of hectares of land for projects like a multi-billion-naira aluminum rolling mill and collaborations with international firms to develop the state\u2019s agricultural potential. He emphasized the importance of reviving abandoned agricultural projects and infrastructure, saying he would set aside about $10 million for these efforts this fiscal year. Governor Fubara highlighted the investment opportunities across diverse sectors, including oil and gas, agriculture, manufacturing, hospitality, tourism, education, ICT, healthcare, infrastructure development, glass products, garments production, and power generation and transmission. With over 40% of fertile cultivable landmass, Rivers State has the potential to significantly contribute to national food security through commercial investments in mechanized agriculture and agro-processing industrial value chains, he said. In his keynote address, former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Kingsley Moghalu, said that due to the prevalence of poor governance in Nigeria, the abundant human and natural resources in the country have not been sufficiently harnessed to achieve the desired prosperity. He particularly advocated for the implementation of well-meaning policies to dismantle barriers to doing business while promoting transparency and building investor confidence. Moghalu added that, alongside developing requisite skills among the people and building enduring critical infrastructure, the foundation for good and competent governance should be assured to make the foreign direct investment (FDI) sought truly beneficial to the country. Sanusi concluded by highlighting the importance of investing in human capital and creating an education system that meets contemporary labor market demands. He called for an end to corruption in the judiciary, sensible tax policies, and the development of a skilled workforce to reduce dependence on foreign expertise. He urged Rivers State to aspire beyond being a recipient of federal allocations to becoming a commercial and industrial hub where citizens enjoy a decent standard of living.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/africa/nigerias-rivers-state-investor-magnet-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "world"}}

Just under 109 million people across broad swaths of the US were under threat of large hail, damaging winds and a fierce twisters Sunday, mainly throughout the mid-Mississippi, Ohio and Tennessee River valleys. As the storms move east, the Storm Prediction Center warned of \u201cviolent tornadoes, extreme hail and corridors of widespread wind damage.\u201d President Joe Biden has been briefed on the storms. A heightened tornado watch designated as a rare \u201cparticularly dangerous situation\u201d calling for \u201cseveral tornadoes and few intense likely\u201d went into effect on Sunday, according to the Storm Prediction Center. LIVE UPDATES FROM THE REGION The watch covers parts of Arkansas, Illinois, Kentucky, Missouri and Tennessee \u2013 including in St. Louis and Jefferson City, Missouri; Paducah, Kentucky; and Carbondale, Illinois \u2013 and impacts 4.7 million people. This is a special kind of tornado watch issued only when there\u2019s unusually high confidence in the potential of multiple at least EF2-strength and long-lived tornadoes in the area, according to the National Weather Service. The supercell thunderstorms firing up in the watch area will also be capable of large hail bigger than the size of baseballs and damaging wind gusts to 75 mph. \u201cIntense supercell thunderstorms will continue to develop across the watch area through this evening. Several tornadoes are likely, some of which are expected to be intense. Very large hail is also likely, along with the risk for potentially significant damaging wind gusts,\u201d says the Storm Prediction Center. Severe storms kill over a dozen people At least seven people in Cooke County, Texas, were killed when severe storms hit the area Saturday night, Sheriff Ray Sappington told CNN. Two victims were 2 and 5 years old. At least eight people died in Arkansas, officials say. Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders declared a state of emergency Sunday afternoon to support the severe weather and tornado-ravaged parts of the state.\u00a0 One person died in Kentucky, according to Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg. In northeast Oklahoma, two people were killed and at least 23 were injured as a result of severe storms overnight, local officials told CNN. Survey teams from the National Weather Service found severe damage Sunday in Claremore, Oklahoma, giving the tornado a preliminary rating of EF3 \u2013 which pack winds between 136 and 165 mph. Inside a Shell gas station in northeast Texas, 60 to 80 people were trapped until the storm blew over, Sappington said. Multiple injuries were reported at the station, but none were life-threatening, he added. In north Denton County, a possible tornado injured an unknown number of people, damaged several homes, overturned 18-wheelers, downed trees and knocked out power lines on Saturday night, authorities said early Sunday. \u201cMultiple victims\u201d were reported in Ray Roberts after severe weather struck the area overnight, city of Denton fire officials\u00a0said. Damage to several homes was also reported in the neighboring city of Celina, where officials said the city was affected by \u201capparent\u00a0tornadic activity\u201d on Saturday. Lake Ray Roberts Marina\u00a0in the city of Sanger in Denton County sustained damage to boats, boat houses and the fuel dock by the severe weather Saturday night. Despite reports of people rescued after being trapped in overturned RVs, there are no reports of serious injuries. \u201cThere is so much damage, we don\u2019t even know where to start,\u201d the marina said in a\u00a0Facebook post\u00a0Sunday morning. \u201cWe know the boat houses are heavily damaged, all have lost walkways, and most boats are damaged,\u201d the post said. \u201cWe lost our fuel dock and offices along with our dock cat, Ginger.\u201d A survey team with the National Weather Service in Dallas found that a tornado of at least a preliminary rating of EF2 strength struck Valley View in northern Texas with estimated maximum winds of 135 mph. The team also said damage found in south Montague County, just south of Forestburg, was consistent with an EF2 tornado and estimated maximum winds of 125 mph. Gov. Greg Abbott on Sunday signed a disaster declaration for four additional counties \u2013 Denton, Collin, Cooke and Montague \u2013 bringing the total to 106 counties. \u201cI saw the harrowing video inside the Valley View gas station as the tornado passed through with the people stockpiled in their clinging to safety,\u201d Abbott said at a news conference, adding that it\u2019s a \u201cmiracle\u201d everyone made it out alive. At least 100 people have been injured in Texas, said Abbott, who referred to the deaths as a \u201cheart-wrenching loss of life.\u201d As damaged areas recover, storms move east More than 600,000 customers across 12 states were without power by Sunday evening, including more than 135,000 outages in Kentucky alone, according to the tracking website\u00a0poweroutage.us. There is a Level 3 of 5 risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of the Mississippi and Ohio valleys into Monday morning, and EF2 to EF5 tornadoes and wind gusts of 74 mph are possible, according to the Storm Prediction Center. Storms will move\u00a0toward the East Coast on Monday, bringing disruptive high winds and large hail from DC through the Southeast. The travel hubs of Chicago, Indianapolis, St. Louis and Nashville could have to contend with damaging storms, leading to delayed or canceled flights. The potential for heavy rain over parts of the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys, middle Mississippi Valley, and Central Appalachians prompted the slight risk, Level 2 of 4, of excessive rainfall in those regions through Monday morning. Louisville, Kentucky; Cincinnati; St. Louis; Nashville and Indianapolis are among the cities included in the Level 3 threat. Record-breaking heat possible for some The unofficial start of summer is also ushering in sweltering heat, reaching potentially record high temperatures for parts of the US on Monday. Houston; New Orleans; Miami; Mobile, Alabama, Tampa, Florida; and Charleston, South Carolina, are among locations where warm weather will feel more like July than late May through the holiday weekend. A subtropical upper-level high over Mexico will help spawn excessive heat warnings and heat advisories over southern Texas through Monday, according to the Storm Prediction Center. \u201cThe ridging will create a dangerous early-season heat wave over south Texas and southern Florida,\u201d according to the center. Daily high temperatures and heat index reading exceeding 115 are possible in some areas, the Storm Prediction Center noted. Those spending time outdoors or who are dealing with a loss of power should drink enough water, dress in lightweight clothing and locate cooling centers if necessary.

{"id": "2024_05_23_uk_uk-election-explainer-sunak-starmer-gbr-intl", "text": "Britain\u2019s Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has taken the biggest gamble of his troubled premiership by calling an early general election that almost everyone in Westminster believes he will lose. We\u2019ll know soon enough whether the decision was a masterstroke or a misfire. A frenetic six-week campaign will dominate airwaves in the UK \u2013 once again putting political battles front and center in a country fatigued by a turbulent stretch for the state. If, as current polls indicate, the opposition Labour party triumph, it will finally bring down the curtain of a 14-year era of Conservative rule, ushering in a center-left government led by former barrister Keir Starmer. Any other outcome would mean Sunak has orchestrated a shocking victory that even many in his own party believe is beyond reach \u2013 and would result in the Conservatives extending a political dynasty toward the two-decade mark. Here are some key questions answered. Why did Sunak call an election now \u2013 and is it a gamble? Sunak was obliged to call an election by December and hold it by the following month, but until that deadline \u2013 five years on from the last vote \u2013 the decision of when to stage a poll is in the gift of the prime minister. Sunak told journalists at a drinks reception in December that it would be in 2024, not January 2025, and has more recently said his \u201cassumption\u201d is that it would happen in the second half of the year \u2013 which 4 July is, just about. But beyond those clues, he has been tight-lipped while he weighed his options \u2013 feeding frenzied speculation in Westminster for months. The main problem facing him is that no good options existed. Sunak is down around 20 points in opinion polls, and that deficit hasn\u2019t budged all year. The economy is gloomy, and one line of thinking among his aides is that waiting until October or November would give it time to settle. But on the other hand, Sunak has placed much of his political capital into his pledge to stop small boat crossings to the UK by asylum seekers. He has recently passed a controversial law to process some claims in Rwanda, though nobody has yet been deported and further legal challenges may await the plan. Meanwhile, the warmer summer months are expected to see a huge number of such journeys across the English Channel, hurting a major pillar of his campaign message. Ultimately, hours after some rare good economic news \u2013 a healthy month-on-month reduction in the rate of inflation \u2013 Sunak decided that Wednesday was the least bad time to pull the trigger. Who\u2019s expected to win? The near-universal expectation is that Sunak\u2019s Conservative Party will lose the election. Labour have been leading in general election opinion polls since late 2021, and that lead has been huge for the entirety of Sunak\u2019s premiership. They are around 20 points up on average, with the Tories often closer to third party challengers like Reform and the Liberal Democrats than they are to Labour. When converted to a projection of seats in parliament, those figures indicate either a comfortable Labour win or a Labour win so huge it would spell a near-wipeout for the Conservatives. The Conservative brand was damaged by Partygate and a number of other scandals that led to the demise of Boris Johnson\u2019s premiership, and then the shambolic six-week tenure of his successor Liz Truss, whose fiscal agenda sent markets into turmoil. But for Sunak\u2019s team, some deeper numbers provide some comfort. While Keir Starmer leads Sunak in polling on the question of who would make a better prime minister, that lead is much smaller than the overall party voting gap \u2013 suggesting Sunak will seek to keep the focus on a \u201cme versus him\u201d message. Some polling experts also suggested that recent local elections may indicate a slimmer Labour win than polling does, but it is notoriously difficult to extrapolate nationwide forecasts from local votes in only some parts of the country. Sunak may also take heart from an unlikely source: the left-wing former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who started the 2017 general election facing a similar deficit and eventually forced a hung parliament, in a narrow loss to Theresa May. Nonetheless, Sunak hasn\u2019t been able to move the polls in his favor since he became leader \u2013 he has just six weeks left to do so to claim a stunning upset victory. What happens next? Party leaders are already on the campaign trail, but parliament has a few days to wrap up any pressing issues before it is officially dissolved, 25 days before polling day. Once that happens, the parliament that was formed in the previous, 2019 general election ceases to exist \u2013 and all sitting lawmakers are no longer MPs. Sunak\u2019s government will continue to run the country, albeit in a skeleton format. The main priority for every party will be the weeks-long dash around the country, where party leaders will seek to be pictured knocking on doors, standing in hi-vis jackets and meeting members of the public. A series of TV debates will likely be organized too, when Sunak and Starmer will go head-to-head. Then on Thursday, July 4, Britons will vote between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m. local time, and as soon as polls close, votes will be counted. A winner is usually declared in the early hours of Friday morning. Who is Keir Starmer? Rishi Sunak\u2019s rival for power is Labour leader Keir Starmer, who is heavily favored to become Britain\u2019s new prime minister in July. A former, well-respected human rights lawyer who then served as Britain\u2019s most senior prosecutor, Starmer came into politics late in life. He became a Labour MP in 2015 and less than five years later was the party\u2019s leader, following a stint as shadow Brexit Secretary during Britain\u2019s protracted exit from the European Union. Starmer inherited a party reeling from its worst electoral defeat in generations, but he prioritized an overhaul of its culture \u2013 staring down left-wing supporters of former leader Jeremy Corbyn, and apologizing publicly for a long-running antisemitism scandal that had tainted the group\u2019s standing with the public. He has attempted to lay claim to Britain\u2019s political center ground, and is described by his supporters as a principled, serious leader with a focus on tackling the systemic issues facing Britain. But his opponents, on both the left of his own party and the right of the political spectrum, say he lacks charisma and ideas, and charge that he has failed to set out an ambitious and broad vision for the nation. Who else is standing? Only Sunak or Starmer have a realistic chance of becoming prime minister, but their plans could be disrupted by a number of smaller parties. Sunak is especially vulnerable to the success of the Reform Party \u2013 a right-wing group attempting to outflank him on immigration \u2013 and the Liberal Democrats, a centrist, pro-European group who have chipped away at Conservative support in affluent, southern parts of England. Given Labour\u2019s standing in the polls, Starmer is more equipped to take the fight to other groups. North of the border, he will look to end the Scottish National Party (SNP)\u2019s generation-long dominance at the ballot box, capitalizing on a rocky period in the party\u2019s recent history that has seen them replace two leaders in just over a year. But he will need to be mindful of the Green Party, which has challenged him from the left and has attracted some younger liberal votes as a result. In recent local elections, there was evidence too that Labour\u2019s stance on Israel\u2019s war against Hamas in Gaza had harmed the party in majority-Muslim areas. How does voting work? In the UK, voters don\u2019t elect a prime minister directly. Instead, they elect a member of parliament (MP) to represent their local constituency. The leader of the party that wins a majority of the UK\u2019s 650 constituencies automatically becomes prime minister, and can form a government. That means 326 is the magic number for an overall majority. If there\u2019s no majority, they need to look for help elsewhere, ruling as a minority government \u2013 as Theresa May did after a close 2017 result \u2013 or forming a coalition, as David Cameron did after 2010. The monarch has an important role; King Charles III must approve the formation of a government, the decision to hold an election and the dissolution of parliament. But this is a formal role only; the King won\u2019t contradict his prime minister or overrule the results of an election. What issues will decide the election? The answer to that question will go some way in deciding the night\u2019s winner. Labour will be keen to define the election as a referendum on 14 years of Conservative rule,  seizing on public fatigue with a party that has produced five prime ministers in that span and overseen Brexit, a stuttering economy and a series of sleaze scandals. In particular, Starmer will talk plenty about the cost of living hitting British families, and the state of the country\u2019s overstaffed and stretched National Health Service (NHS). Sunak, by contrast, will want to focus on migration \u2013 his pledge to \u201cStop the Boats\u201d hasn\u2019t yet worked, but his flagship Rwanda policy has at least become law. And he will attempt to convince voters that the economy has turned a corner, and can\u2019t risk a change in governance.

The umpire that fans and players loved to hate \u2013 one of the more controversial figures in the game \u2013 has retired after more than three decades. \u201cStarting with my first Major League game in 1991, I have had the very good experience of living out my childhood dream of umpiring in the Major Leagues,\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez said in a statement Monday night. \u201cThere is nothing better than working at a profession that you enjoy. \u201cI treasured the camaraderie of my colleagues and the friendships I have made along the way, including our locker room attendants in all the various cities.\u201d During his career, Hern\u00e1ndez was an unpopular figure \u2013 often skewered by irate fans, players and managers for suspect ball and strike calls and other controversial on-field decisions. His highlights and lowlights live forever on replay and the internet, becoming a bit of a punching bag on social media platforms. In 2023, as a third base umpire, Hern\u00e1ndez called Philadelphia Phillies star Bryce Harper out on a questionable checked swing on a full count \u2013 three balls and two strikes. Harper argued the call and was ejected. After the game, Harper told reporters, \u201cIt\u2019s \u00c1ngel in the middle of something again.It\u2019s just, every year, it\u2019s the same story. \u2026 It\u2019s the same thing over and over and over and over again. It\u2019s just not right.\u201d In 2022, Phillies outfielder Kyle Schwarber threw his bat and helmet, screaming at Hern\u00e1ndez after a suspect third strike call in the ninth inning of a 1-0 game against the Milwaukee Brewers. Schwarber, who was promptly ejected, went ballistic, with hand gestures and histrionics. After the Boston Red Sox won Game 4 of the 2018 ALDS, New York Yankees pitcher CC Sabathia called Hern\u00e1ndez \u201cabsolutely terrible\u201d in a post-game interview. \u201cHe shouldn\u2019t be anywhere near a playoff game,\u201d Sabathia said. Following a video review, three of Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s calls from Game 3 of that series were overturned. One social media site, Umpire Auditor, a site that critiques the men in blue, posted a thank you to Hern\u00e1ndez for all of the material he provided through the years. \u201cFrom the bottom of my heart, thank you \u00c1ngel Hern\u00e1ndez. You gave me more content than I could have possibly dreamed of. I didn\u2019t deserve you. Enjoy your retirement, king,\u201d the post reads. In 2017, the Cuban native sued MLB for racial discrimination, in part, because he had not been promoted. A US district judge in 2021 and a federal appeals court in 2023 rejected the lawsuit. Hern\u00e1ndez joined the Major League staff in 1993, two years after calling his first game as a call-up umpire. He umpired 12 Division Series, eight League Championship Series, two World Series and three All-Star Games. \u201cNeedless to say, there have been many positive changes in the game of baseball since I first entered the profession. This includes the expansion and promotion of minorities. I am proud that I was able to be an active participant in that goal while being a Major League umpire,\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez added. On March 22, 2016, he and another MLB umpire were a part of the historic exhibition game between the Tampa Bay Rays and the Cuban National Team at Estadio Latinoamericano in Havana. Hern\u00e1ndez witnessed then Detroit Tigers pitcher Spencer Turnbull\u2019s no-hitter against the Seattle Mariners in May 2021 behind the plate. His last game was the Chicago White Sox and Cleveland Guardians contest on May 9 at Guaranteed Rate Field in Chicago.

The 22-time grand slam champion was eliminated in the first round of the French Open by Alexander Zverev on Monday and said Paris 2024 is now the \u201cmain goal\u201d for the summer. The transition from clay to grass is the most difficult surface change on the tennis calendar. Wimbledon gets underway on July 1, with the Olympic tennis tournament starting less than a month later on July 27. \u201cIt looks difficult,\u201d Nadal, who won singles gold at Beijing 2008, said of his Wimbledon prospects. \u201cHonestly, I can\u2019t confirm what\u2019s going on, but for me, now it looks difficult to make the transition to grass, having the Olympics again on clay. \u201cSo I cannot confirm anything, I need to talk with the team, I need to analyze so many facts, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be smart after all the things that happened to my body to now make a big transition to a completely different surface and then come back immediately to clay. \u201cToday, I feel that\u2019s not a good idea. I can\u2019t confirm, but my feeling is, even if I am booked in Wimbledon because I had to, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a positive idea right now.\u201d Nadal is also set to play in the doubles at Paris 2024 with Carlos Alcaraz. The 37-year-old has struggled with injury since the 2023 Australian Open and was forced to miss the vast majority of last season as he tried to get his body ready for one last year on tour. After previously announcing that 2024 would likely be his last year in professional tennis, Nadal opened the door to a possible return in 2025 after his defeat to Zverev, saying he is \u201cnot 100% sure\u201d the loss was his final appearance at Roland Garros. But given his injury struggles over the last 18 months, Nadal admitted that, even if prioritizes being fit for the Olympics, there is no guarantee he will be. \u201cI cannot tell you if I will be or won\u2019t be in one month and a half,\u201d Nadal said. \u201cMy body has been a jungle for two years and you don\u2019t know what to expect. I wake up one day and I found a snake biting me; another day, a tiger. \u201cIt\u2019s been a big fight with all of the things I went through, but the dynamic is positive the last few weeks. I felt ready. I think tomorrow I will be ready to play again if I had to \u2013 but I will not have to,\u201d he laughed. \u201cI need to clear my ideas now and see what the new calendar is for me to be ready for the Olympics. \u201cI can\u2019t say anything today, but my main goal now is to play the Olympics that are going to be here, so I need to prepare myself the proper way: to try to arrive here healthy and well prepared \u2013 and then let\u2019s see.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/sport/rafael-nadal-wimbledon-paris-olympics-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_05_28_americas_ammo-arrests-turks-and-caicos", "text": "Five Americans were arrested in Turks and Caicos within the past six months because of tightened gun control laws in the territory that make bringing in firearms or ammunition without prior permission from police a crime with a mandatory 12-year prison sentence. Michael Lee Evans, 72, of Texas; Sharitta Grier, 45, of Florida; Bryan Hagerich, of Pennsylvania; Ryan Tyler Watson, 40, of Oklahoma and Tyler Wenrich, 31, of Virginia, were all accused of bringing various amounts of ammunition to Turks and Caicos, a 40-island chain southeast of the Bahamas.  While some have pleaded guilty, paid fines or returned to the US, others await trial with the road ahead unclear. But what is clear: all have said the ammunition recovered from their luggage was not intentionally packed, according to American lawmakers petitioning for their expedited release. Here\u2019s what we know so far about the Americans and the laws in Turks and Caicos: No constitutional right to carry firearms in Turks and Caicos Even though the territory doesn\u2019t manufacture firearms or ammunition, the number of firearms finding their way to the islands has increased, Turks and Caicos Premier Washington Misick said. And that\u2019s a worry for the British Overseas Territory. While it is legal to fly in the US with unloaded firearms and ammunition in checked baggage, according to the Transportation Security Administration, bringing firearms or ammunition into Turks and Caicos without prior permission from police is \u201cstrictly forbidden.\u201d Firearm and ammunition offenses carry a mandatory minimum custodial sentence of 12 years and a fine, according to the Turks and Caicos Island Government. The mandatory sentence is in place to protect those on the islands, Gov. Dileeni Daniel-Selvaratnam said. Judges may use their discretion to impose reduced sentences in \u201cexceptional circumstances,\u201d she said. But no special treatment should be given to any group, the Turks and Caicos premier said. \u201cThe law must be applied even-handedly,\u201d Misick said. US citizens are not being targeted, Turks and Caicos officials have said. Of the 195 people sentenced for firearm-related offenses over the past six years, only seven were United States citizens, Misick said last week, and none of them received the 12-year sentence. While the US and Turks and Caicos collaborate in battling narcotics, terrorism and money laundering, \u201cour laws and processes are not congruent,\u201d Misick said. \u201cWe are a separate sovereignty. We respect the United States\u2019 laws and we will never think to interfere in its operation.\u201d Here\u2019s what we know so far about the Americans and the laws in Turks and Caicos: Bryan Hagerich Hagerich was the first of the five to return to Pennsylvania after he received a suspended 52-week sentence on Friday, which meant he wouldn\u2019t face immediate incarceration, his representatives said. He was also given a $6,700 fine. The father of two pleaded guilty to possession of 20 rounds of ammunition, according to the Turks and Caicos government.  Hagerich paid the fine and was allowed to leave the British Overseas Territory. He flew home Friday afternoon, according to Johnathan Franks, a spokesperson for the Bring Our Families Home Campaign, a group that helps wrongfully detained Americans secure release. \u201cWe have a lot of catching up to do,\u201d Hagerich said when he was reunited with his children. \u201cA lot of memories to make together. Just so elated to see them. They\u2019ve been so strong through all this.\u201d After Hagerich arrived at Pittsburgh International Airport on Friday night, he told reporters he was \u201cabsolutely elated\u201d to have his two children jump into his arms, according to CNN affiliate\u00a0WTAE. Before Hagerich\u2019s sentencing, his wife packed two suitcases \u2013 one if he was sentenced to prison and another if he were allowed to return home because the couple was unsure how the judge would rule when they walked into the courtroom on Friday, they said in an exclusive interview with \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d \u201cIt was dark, you have no concept of time,\u201d Hagerich said about his week-long stay in jail in Turks and Caicos. \u201cI was with three folks that were accused of murder. It was scary.\u201d Tyler Wenrich Wenrich pleaded guilty to possession of ammunition while traveling to Turks and Caicos. He was sentenced on Tuesday to three weeks in jail and issued a fine. The Virginia resident was fined $9,000, said Kimo Tynes\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b, director of communications for the Government of the Turks and Caicos Islands in a news statement Tuesday. Since he had already served three weeks in jail, the court recognized it as time served and he won\u2019t be immediately incarcerated, the release said. The Hon. Justice Davidson Baptiste cited exceptional circumstances in Wenrich\u2019s case, saying, \u201cEnforcing the mandatory minimum would have been arbitrary and disproportionate, and would not serve the public interest.\u201d Wenrich was charged with possession of two 9mm rounds, according to the Turks and Caicos government. Michael Lee Evans Evans, 72, pleaded guilty to possession of seven 9mm rounds of ammunition and appeared before the court on April 24 via video conference. The Texan was allowed to return to the United States on bail due to a \u201csevere\u201d medical situation, but will be required to return to Turks and Caicos for his next hearing set for June 18, his attorney Oliver Smith, King\u2019s Counsel, said. Ryan Tyler Watson Watson, who lives in Oklahoma, was charged with possession of four rounds of ammunition. The 40-year-old appeared in court on April 24, according to the TCGI, and is currently on bail. Watson pleaded guilty at a hearing on Tuesday, Tynes, with the communications office of the Government of the Turks and Caicos Islands, confirmed to CNN. He will be sentenced in June. Sharitta Shinese Grier Grier was\u00a0arrested two weeks ago\u00a0and is awaiting trial after making bail, according to Tynes\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b. The Florida mother had no idea that two rounds of ammunition were at the bottom of her luggage when she traveled to Turks and Caicos, she told CNN affiliate\u00a0WFTV earlier this month. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what was going to happen because I couldn\u2019t believe it was in there,\u201d she said. \u201cThey went through my bag and said they found rounds at the bottom of my carry-on.\u201d Grier was released on bail, but she can\u2019t leave the island until her case concludes and must report to a local police station weekly, the station reported. \u201cI\u2019m just broken,\u201d Grier said. Grier\u2019s next court appearance is on July 5, police said. US lawmakers tried to free Americans A US congressional delegation traveled to the islands last week and asked for the charges for the five Americans to be dropped. One of the US lawmakers, Oklahoma Republican Sen.\u00a0Markwayne Mullin, said in a statement, \u201cUnfortunately, despite our willingness to work with Turks and Caicos officials to get our constituents home, we were not able to find a path forward today.\u201d In an interview with ABC News last week, Republican Congressman Rep.\u00a0Guy Reschenthaler said, \u201cIt\u2019s to the point now, (where) every third week an American is being detained wrongfully and Turks and Caicos.\u201d Reschenthaler told CNN the prison on Turks and Caicos has been flagged by the UN for humanitarian concerns. In a House of Assembly address, the islands\u2019 Misick said, \u201cThe (accusations) of congressman (Guy Reschenthaler) against the government and people of the Turks and Caicos Islands are nothing more than diabolic falsehoods.\u201d Reschenthaler told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju he wants to see a \u201cresolution here where the Americans get zero amount of jail time. They should be given time served and be sent home to the United States.\u201d Reschenthaler continued: \u201cThey were innocent mistakes. Any other nation would handle this with a fine in sending that person back to the country of origin. Here, that\u2019s not happening.\u201d On Tuesday, Mullin welcomed the news of Wenrich\u2019s release, saying it\u2019s \u201canother step in the right direction,\u201d according to a post on X. \u201cI again encourage TCI to address the unintended consequences of their law to prevent this from happening again.\u201d CNN\u2019s Sahar Akbarzai, Michael Rios,\u00a0Holly Yan, Fabiana Chaparro, Amanda Musa\u00a0and\u00a0AnneClaire Stapleton contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/americas/ammo-arrests-turks-and-caicos/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "world"}}

Russian troops have taken advantage of a weakened front line in Ukraine, and for the past two weeks have advanced towards Kharkiv. Parts of the region were captured by Russian forces earlier in the war before being liberated. All seven of the deceased, at least five of whom were women, were civilians working for the Factor-Druk printing company in the region\u2019s capital, the city of Kharkiv, according to the regional governor,\u00a0Oleh Syniehubov. Sixteen people were injured at the at printing house, located south of the city center, and another seven were injured elsewhere. After the attack, images emerged of the factory partly reduced to rubble,\u00a0with\u00a0its facade blown off. Factor-Druk publishes around a third of the nation\u2019s books and 10% of its newspapers, the company says on its website. The Ukrainian state railway network was also attacked in the early morning, according to a statement from the company. Six employees were wounded, the company said. A CNN team travelling in the area saw two craters and smoke from impacts near a railway line. Civilians have also been trapped by a new swell of violence engulfing the region. On May 15, Russian forces fired on people desperately trying to flee the town of Vovchansk and killed a woman being pushed in a wheelchair by her husband, Ukrainian prosecutors reported. \u2018Extremely brutal\u2019 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky denounced the \u201cextremely brutal Russian attack\u201d on Kharkiv and the town of Lyubotyn, drawing attention to the fragility of Kyiv\u2019s air defenses in the face of Moscow\u2019s renewed assault. \u201cRussian terrorists are taking advantage of Ukraine\u2019s lack of sufficient air defense protection and reliable capability to destroy terrorist launchers at their exact locations, which are close to our borders,\u201d Zelensky posted on X. Earlier this month, the US approved a $400 million package of air defense munitions and other weapons to Ukraine. But senior officials in Kyiv have warned that recent flush of aid will not be enough to fend off further Russian advances. CNN journalists in the town of Lyptsi, around 20 miles north of Kharkiv city, saw troops using aging and inadequate weaponry, in an attempt to repel highly-equipped Russian units bolstered by drones. Zelensky is growing increasingly exasperated by a condition imposed by Washington and other Western allies that the weapons they provide to Ukraine cannot be used to launch munitions into Russia. \u201cI don\u2019t think there should be any restrictions, because this is not about the Ukrainian army using Western weapons on Russian territory for offensive,\u201d Zelensky told reporters in Kyiv earlier this month. \u201cThis is defense.\u201d White House officials earlier this month said their stance on the issue remained. \u201cWe do not encourage nor do we enable attacks using US-supplied weapons systems inside Russian territory,\u201d US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said during a press briefing on May 17.\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s the policy.\u00a0That has not changed.\u201d This story has been updated with additional information.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/europe/russian-strikes-kharkiv-ukraine-may-23-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "travel_bear-attack-survival-grand-teton-shayne-burke", "text": "Shayne Patrick Burke was looking for owls in the wilds of Wyoming, but he found grizzlies instead. Just moments after Burke noticed a bear cub within 50 to 70 yards, he saw a mother grizzly bear charging toward him. \u201cI stood my ground, shouted and attempted to deploy the bear spray but as I did she already closed the gap,\u201d he wrote in a\u00a0Facebook post about the May 19 incident\u00a0in Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming.\u00a0CNN has tried to reach Burke \u2013 whose location is listed as South Hadley, Massachusetts, on social media \u2013 but has not received a response. The\u00a0encounter, which matched details given by the National Park Service about an attack on an unnamed man near Signal Mountain, could easily have ended tragically with a human death, an animal death \u2014\u00a0or both. Burke had been hoping to photograph a Great Grey Owl and was hustling back through the wilderness to meet his wife. With just seconds to react, Burke turned his back as the bear pounced, laid down on his stomach \u201cand braced for the ride\u201d with his hands interlocked behind his neck for protection, the post said. \u201cThe first bite and slash was on my back / right shoulder. I screamed. She then turned, stepping on my back. She bit one of my legs, picking me up and slamming me on the ground multiple times,\u201d the post said. The bear bit each leg about three times, he said. He screamed again with the final bite, which brought the bear\u2019s attention to his head. \u201cI believe she went in for a kill bite on my neck. I still had my hands interlocked and my arms protecting my carotid arteries. I never let go of the bear spray can,\u201d Burke wrote in the post. \u201cAs she bit my hands in the back of my neck, she simultaneously bit the bear spray can and it exploded in her mouth,\u201d he wrote. That\u2019s what saved him from the initial attack, he said. \u201cIt was\u00a0the most violent thing I have ever experienced,\u201d he said in his social media post. \u201cI\u2019ve experienced being shot at, mortared and IED explosions. I am a disabled Veteran in the Army reserve.\u201d \u2018I very well could die\u2019 The National Park Service did not name Burke but confirmed that a 35-year-old man from Massachusetts was attacked on May 19 \u201cas he was hiking through a forested area with diminished visibility.\u201d NPS noted that \u201cthe visitor was carrying bear spray and intentionally making noise based on posted bear safety information from the National Park Service.\u201d The NPS account mirrors Burke\u2019s post: \u201cJust as the larger bear made contact with him, he intentionally fell to the ground on his stomach to attempt to play dead. He interlaced his fingers behind his neck with the bear spray canister caught in one of his fingers,\u201d NPS said via email. The cannister bursting caused the bears to leave the scene, NPS said. According to NPS and Burke\u2019s post, he quickly moved to an area with some cellular coverage. A call to his wife failed, so he texted \u201cattacked.\u201d When she called back, he told her about the encounter as he administered first aid on himself. Photos included with Burke\u2019s post on social media show deep gashes in his hand and back. He noted in his account that he had received advanced first aid training in the army, and\u00a0his wife talked him through treating his wounds with what he had with him. \u201cI cut my back pack straps, camera straps and used my Fanny pack straps\u201d to make improvised tourniquets to control the bleeding. In a later Facebook post, Burke emphasized the role his wife, Chloe, played in summoning help, calming him over the phone and keeping him focused on tending to his wounds and blowing a rescue whistle. Her Facebook profile lists her as an EMT. At 4:02 p.m., Teton Interagency Dispatch Center received notification of the incident, NPS said. With multiple puncture wounds in both legs, Burke knew his situation was perilous. \u201cIn this moment, I accepted on that small hill top that I very well could die,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI recorded a short video telling my people that I loved them.\u201d \u2018Please don\u2019t kill the bear\u2019 Fortunately, help arrived in time. Park rangers were able to locate Burke and administer emergency medical care. He was airlifted to a waiting ambulance and transported to St. John\u2019s Hospital, NPS said. Burke said in his post that he received surgery to clean and staple his wounds. According to the park service, the injured man was released from the hospital on May 20 and is \u201cexpected to make a full recovery.\u201d Park rangers and wildlife biologists investigated the scene the day after the incident. \u201cBased on interviews with the injured visitor and evidence found in the area, it is likely that the mauling involved an adult female grizzly bear with at least one older cub,\u201d the National Park Service said. The specific bears had not been identified. NPS said the bear\u2019s behavior appeared to be \u201ca defensive action,\u201d and that \u201cno further management action is warranted at this time.\u201d That\u2019s an apparent relief to Burke, who said in his post, \u201cthe second thing I said to the park rangers was please don\u2019t kill the bear, she was defending her cub.\u201d \u201cWrong place wrong time,\u201d he said. Bear-country preparation But Burke was prepared. \u201cThe number one thing that kept me alive during the attack was reading and understanding what to do in the event of a bear attack and being prepared with the bear spray,\u201d he said in his post. \u201cThough I am not sure if I got to spray any at the bear, having it on me and keeping it in my hands while protecting my vitals 100% is the only reason I am telling my story now.\u201d The National Park Service shared these tips for backcountry explorers: \u2022 Be alert and aware of your surroundings.\u2022 Make noise, especially in areas with limited visibility or when sound is muffled (e.g., near streams or when it is windy).\u2022 Carry bear spray, know how to use it, and keep it readily accessible.\u2022 Hike in groups of three or more people.\u00a0\u2022 Do not run.

The home was fully renovated and expanded in 2018, the listing added, but the \u201cintegrity of the home\u2019s most memorable and recognizable spaces\u201d have been maintained. Features include a \u201cmagazine-worthy gourmet kitchen with double islands,\u201d a hot tub and a movie theater. The \u201cbiggest surprise\u201d is an indoor sports court complete with a three-point line. In 2021,\u00a0fans of the movie were given the opportunity to rent the house for one night only \u2013 and for just $25. Prospective visitors were free to feast on Chicago pizza and Kraft Macaroni and Cheese, much like the youngest McAllister opted for when he was left home alone. Lego also created a fan-designed replica of the house which retailed for $249.99 in 2021. The 3,955-piece set was \u201can incredibly detailed recreation\u201d according to the company, which replicated the ground and first floor, kitchen, basement and attic. Other famous homes have hit the market at the multi-million-dollar mark. In February, Freddie Mercury\u2019s former West London residence went on sale for \u00a330 million ($38 million). Horror fans also had the chance to buy the home featured in the 1984 classic \u201cA Nightmare on Elm Street\u201d when the Los Angeles property went on sale for $3.25 million in 2021.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/style/home-alone-house-sale-chicago-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_23_asia_china-military-drills-taiwan-second-day-intl-hnk", "text": "China\u2019s military drills around Taiwan are designed to test its ability to \u201cseize power\u201d over the island, the People\u2019s Liberation Army said Friday as its forces kicked off a second day of large-scale exercises encircling its democratic neighbor. The drills are the largest in more than a year and come just days after Taiwan swore in its new president, Lai Ching-te, who is openly loathed by Beijing for championing the island\u2019s sovereignty and distinct identity. Beijing has denounced Lai as a \u201cdangerous separatist\u201d and decried his inauguration speech on Monday, during which he called on China to cease its intimidation of Taiwan, which has grown much more pronounced under Chinese leader Xi Jinping. The PLA, which dwarfs Taipei\u2019s outgunned military, kicked off the exercises on Thursday morning, sending warships and fighter jets around Taiwan and its outlying islands in\u00a0what it called \u201ca strong punishment for separatist acts of Taiwan independence forces.\u201d On Friday, the PLA\u2019s Eastern Theater Command said it was continuing the drills on both sides of the Taiwan island chain to \u201ctest the ability to jointly seize power, launch joint attacks and occupy key areas.\u201d China\u2019s ruling Communist Party views Taiwan as part of its territory, despite never having controlled it, and has vowed to take the island by force if necessary. The vast majority of Taiwanese have no desire to live under Chinese rule. But Xi, China\u2019s most authoritarian leader in a generation, has made clear the island\u2019s \u201cinevitable reunification\u201d with the mainland cannot be put off indefinitely. The two-day exercises, involving joint operations of China\u2019s army, navy, air force and rocket force,\u00a0are being conducted in the Taiwan Strait \u2013 a narrow body of water separating the island from mainland China \u2013 as well as north, south and east of Taiwan, according to the PLA. For the first time, the PLA drills also involved China\u2019s Coast Guard, operating in areas around Taiwan\u2019s outlying islands of Kinmen, Matsu, Wuqiu and Dongyin, located just off the southeastern coast of China. CCTV aired footage on Friday that shows PLA soldiers moving mobile artillery and missile systems into position, though it did not show any live fire. Taiwan\u2019s Defense Ministry has condemned China\u2019s military exercises as \u201cirrational provocations\u201d and dispatched its own sea, air and ground forces in response. Between 6 a.m. Thursday and 6 a.m. Friday, the ministry detected 49 Chinese aircraft, including 35 that crossed the Median Line, an informal demarcation point in the Taiwan Strait that Beijing does not recognize but until recent years had largely respected. A total of 19 Chinese warships and seven coast guard vessels were detected near the Taiwan Strait, according to the ministry. Taiwan\u2019s presidential office said Thursday it is \u201cregrettable to see China threatening Taiwan\u2019s democracy and freedom and regional peace and stability with unilateral military provocations,\u201d adding Taiwan has the \u201cconfidence and ability to protect national security.\u201d First week in office Lai has had a busy and politically turbulent start to his presidency after taking over from two-term leader Tsai Ing-wen, to kick off a historic third consecutive term for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). The PLA\u2019s drills pose the first real test for the veteran politician in managing tensions with Beijing, which has refused his offer to talk and to resume cross-strait tourism and student exchanges. On Friday, China\u2019s Defense Ministry accused Lai of pushing Taiwan into \u201ca dangerous situation of war\u201dand \u201cplaying with fire.\u201d \u201cThose who play with fire will burn themselves,\u201d ministry spokesperson Wu Qian told reporters, using rhetoric China frequently deploys for Taiwan\u2019s government. \u201cWhenever \u2018Taiwan independence\u2019 (forces) provoke us, we will push our countermeasures forward until the complete reunification of the motherland is achieved.\u201d Domestically, Lai is facing chaos in the legislature, where opposition parties who favor closer ties to China hold a majority, and have pushed to subject his administration to tighter scrutiny. Thousands of mostly young people have taken to the streets to protest the opposition\u2019s attempt to fast-track the proposed bills to grant the parliament more power. But despite Beijing\u2019s large show of force, life continued as normal in Taiwan, whose 23 million people have become used to China\u2019s military threats, even as they become more regular and prominent in recent years. \u201cWe are not scared of the Chinese Communist Party, and we have confidence,\u201d\u00a0an 88-year-old retiree, who gave his surname Liu, told CNN. \u201cIf the Chinese Communist Party does attack Taiwan, it won\u2019t be easy for them to take Taiwan. Taiwanese people are not afraid of war.\u201d A 42-year-old mother, who gave her surname Tsai, said she wasn\u2019t even aware the PLA drills were taking place. \u201cI believe leaders will prioritize people\u2019s happiness, so I\u2019m not worried. I think peace will be maintained,\u201d she said. \u2018Blockading Taiwan\u2019 China\u2019s military drills are often as much about playing to a domestic audience as signaling intentions internationally, and state media has ramped up coverage of the drills. Zhang Chi, a Chinese military expert, told China\u2019s state broadcaster CCTV that the PLA\u2019s exercises focused on \u201cpracticing a new mode of blockading Taiwan.\u201d \u201cTaiwan is an isolated island, suspended in the sea with weak self-sufficiency. Taiwan\u2019s economy is export-oriented, and most of its energy consumption relies on imports. Once besieged and blockaded, it can easily lead to economic collapse, turning it into a dead island,\u201d he said. The exercises to the south of Taiwan are crucial for the blockade, targeting Kaohsiung port, Taiwan\u2019s largest port and an important base for the island\u2019s navy, Zhang said. Meanwhile, drills to the east of Taiwan are designed to practice cutting off the island\u2019s energy imports, the escape routes for \u201cTaiwan independence\u201d forces and the support line from the US and its allies, he added. The US maintains close but informal relations with Taiwan and is bound by law to supply the island with weapons to defend itself. Zhang also noted that the drills had achieved \u201ca new breakthrough\u201d by entering waters near Wuqiu\u00a0and Dongyin, which hold significant geographical importance. \u201cThe Taiwanese military views them as the front outposts for Taiwan Strait defense operations. This exercise further squeezed the activity space of the Taiwanese military,\u201d he said. Analysts said the China Coast Guard movement close to and around the outlying islands was an important new aspect of the current drills, which follow previous encirclement exercises in August 2022 and April 2023. \u201cThe pressing of Coast Guard and other forces into waters close to those offshore islands is provocative,\u201d said Carl Schuster, a former director of operations at the US Pacific Command\u2019s Joint Intelligence Center. He said he expected such Chinese activities to continue and that they \u201cwill become the norm,\u201d with Beijing at any point able to then turn an exercise into a real military operation. Craig Singleton, senior China fellow at the nonpartisan Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said China\u2019s pattern of exercises around Taiwan does not signal an imminent invasion threat. \u201cThese drills aid in blurring the lines between peace and war, so much so that future exercises could be used as a pretext for an actual invasion,\u201d Singleton said. But Singleton and others say the exercises are sending a bigger political message than a military one. \u201cJoint Sword - 2024A aims at reactivating the military pressure lever to assert a degree of influence on the new (Taiwan) administration and its narrative,\u201d said Lionel Fatton, assistant professor of international relations at Webster University in Geneva, using China\u2019s name for this week\u2019s drills. Beijing will use the pressure of the drills to try to increase divisions within Taiwan, which could \u201cweaken\u201d the island from the inside, he said. \u201cConstant and visible\u00a0military pressure on the island will also help polarize the political apparatus, if not the social fabric itself,\u201d Fatton said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/asia/china-military-drills-taiwan-second-day-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_27_world_papua-new-guinea-landslide-thousands-feared-buried-intl-hnk", "text": "As many as 2,000 people are feared to have been buried by last week\u2019s massive landslide in Papua New Guinea, according to the country\u2019s National Disaster Centre, as survivors recounted the horror losing so many loved ones. The landslide occurred in the mountainous Enga region\u00a0in northern Papua New Guinea on Friday and the latest missing figure is a sharp rise from earlier estimates. Locals have been left reeling after tonnes of rock and mud smashed into their homes as they slept. Rescuers have struggled to reach such a remote part of what is already one of Asia\u2019s poorest nations leaving locals with little choice but to dig through the collapsed mountainside with whatever tools they have. Evit Kambu shared that she had lost more than a dozen family members in the disaster. \u201cI have 18 of my family members buried under the debris and soil that I am standing on and a lot more family members in the village I cannot count,\u201d she told Reuters news agency. \u201cI am the landowner here\u2026 but I cannot retrieve the bodies so I am standing here helplessly.\u201d Miok Michael, a local community leader, told CNN that it was likely there were few survivors. \u201cPeople are gathering and mourning,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople have been digging since day one but can\u2019t locate bodies as they are covered by huge rocks. Only machines will do.\u201d Soon after the disaster occurred, the United Nations said as many as 100 may have died. That was later revised up to 670, according to estimates from the Chief of Mission for the International Organization for Migration (IOM) in the country. But that may now be a major underestimate according to the latest projection from Papua New Guinea\u2019s disaster agency. \u201cThe landslide buried more than 2000 people alive and caused major destruction to buildings, food gardens and caused major impact on the economic lifeline of the country,\u201d Lusete Laso Mana, Acting Director the National Disaster Centre, said in a letter to the UN. \u201cThe situation remains unstable as the landslip continues to shift slowly, posing ongoing danger to both rescue teams and survivors alike,\u201d he added, saying the main highway to the area had been completely blocked by the landslide. The scale of the devastation Chris Jensen, PNG National Director of World Vision, told CNN that rescue workers \u201cclearly realized the scale of the devastation.\u201d \u201cThis is a landslide of massive proportion. It\u2019s quite astonishing \u2013 a whole mountain literally fell on so many households during the middle of the night.\u201d \u201cWe can\u2019t create further\u00a0problems with land\u2026 so we really got to be very careful about the\u00a0response now,\u201d Jensen said. Justine McMahon, PNG Country Director for the global humanitarian agency CARE International, said the full death toll \u201cwas still unknown, because only a few bodies had been recovered.\u201d \u201cThe authorities have been very effective and very responsive and are working around the clock\u2026 but I think given the scale of this disaster and the (numbers of) people affected, there will be resources needed from the wider aid community,\u201d McMahon told CNN. She added that \u201ca great challenge today had been that the ground is still quite unstable.\u201d \u201cGiven that houses were buried under up to 8 meters of dirt (more than 26 feet), it will be difficult to reach some of the victims,\u201d McMahon said. Serhan Aktoprak from the UN agency, International Organization for Migration (IOM), told Reuters that teams on the ground were \u201ctrying to rescue whatever they can by using digging sticks, spades, agricultural forks and their hands.\u201d The landslide\u00a0hit the remote village of Kaokalam, about 600 kilometers (372 miles) northwest of the capital Port Moresby, at approximately 3 a.m. local time on Friday, leaving a scar of debris that humanitarian workers said was\u00a0as big as four football pitches. More than 150 houses in Yambali village were buried in debris, officials said on Sunday. The area continues to pose an \u201cextreme risk,\u201d officials said, as rocks continue to fall and the ground soil is exposed to constant increased pressure. Papua New Guinea is home to around 10 million people. Its vast mountainous terrain and lack of roads have made it difficult to access the affected area. Pierre Rognon, an associate professor from the University of Sydney\u2019s School of Civil Engineering, said it\u2019s \u201cparticularly challenging\u201d for rescuers to find survivors after a landslide. \u201cLandslides can bury collapsed structures and people under dozens of meters of geomaterials,\u201d he said. \u201cTo make things worse, they can move structures and trap people over hundreds of meters. No one can predict exactly where potential survivors may be located and where to start looking for them.\u201d It\u2019s not clear what caused the landslide, but geology professor Alan Collins from the University of Adelaide said it occurred in a region of \u201cconsiderable rainfall.\u201d \u201cAlthough the landslide does not appear to have been directly triggered by an earthquake, frequent earthquakes caused by plates colliding build steep slopes and high mountains that can become very unstable,\u201d Collins said. He said rainfall could have altered the minerals making the bedrock, weakening the rock that forms the steep hillsides. \u201cVegetation mitigates this as tree roots can stabilise the ground and deforestation can make landslides more prevalent by destroying this biological mesh,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to look at what caused this,\u201d said Jensen of World Vision. \u201cThere are no reports of earthquakes at this time but we did have quite a lot of rain and a lot of\u00a0unseasonal weather happening across\u00a0Papua New Guinea,\u201d Jensen said. \u201cThere is\u00a0flooding in other provinces and we\u2019ve got a lot of challenges exacerbated by climate change so we\u2019ll do further assessments and analysis to to try and figure out what caused this.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/27/world/papua-new-guinea-landslide-thousands-feared-buried-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_americas_haiti-gang-mss-kenya-explainer-intl", "text": "After months of planning and discussion, the deployment of an international force to violence-wracked Haiti has been delayed again, puncturing hopes that a vanguard of Kenyan police would arrive this week. High-profile meetings on Thursday hinted at once-high expectations. In the Haitian capital Port-au-Prince, the country\u2019s governing Transitional Presidential Council posted photos of its meeting with a Kenyan delegation. In Washington, US President Joe Biden and Kenyan President William Ruto touted their nations\u2019 collaboration on the mission (largely equipped by the US) at a joint press conference. Peace and security in Haiti are the \u201ccollective responsibility of all nations,\u201d Ruto said, warning that Kenya will \u201ctake that responsibility along with the Haitian police\u201d and \u201cbreak the backs of gangs and criminals.\u201d But for now, armed groups continue to rampage in capital city Port-au-Prince, extorting residents and controlling the movement of vital fuel, food and medical supplies. On Thursday evening, a young US missionary couple were attacked by gangs at a church in the city and later killed, their family said. Who are Haiti\u2019s gangs? Originally created as enforcers for Haiti\u2019s political and business elite, Haiti\u2019s rival gangs have in recent months formed a broad coalition known as \u201cViv Ansamn,\u201d or \u201cLive together,\u201d and are now coordinating attacks on government institutions like police stations and prisons. Haiti\u2019s National Police have been battling the gangs block by block, but they are understaffed and under-equipped. Since the assassination of then-President Jovenel Moise in 2021, the gangs\u2019 grip has expanded from an estimated 50% of the city to 80% today. Law enforcement sources in Haiti now liken the urban battlefield to quicksand, telling CNN that they need reinforcements to hold and defend territory. Complicating the situation is a torrent of smuggled guns and ammunition arming Haiti\u2019s gangs, despite an arms embargo on the island. Earlier this week, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken defended US backing for the international mission, warning a Senate Foreign Relations hearing that without foreign support, Haiti is \u201con the precipice of becoming an all-out failed state.\u201d What is the Multinational Security Support mission? Haiti\u2019s government has been asking for international military assistance since 2022. In October last year, the Multinational Security Support Mission (MSS) was finally greenlit by the United Nations\u2019 powerful Security Council. Designed to coordinate closely with Haiti\u2019s National Police, the MSS is expected to focus on securing the city\u2019s airport, seaport and key roads, according to people with knowledge of the mission\u2019s planning. Kenya, which volunteered to lead the mission, has committed 1,000 police officers. Most of those are Kenyan border police, chosen for their experience in dealing with armed non-state actors such as Al Shabaab and in operating in foreign contexts such as Somalia, Sudan and Congo, according to Bill O\u2019Neill, the UN expert on human rights in Haiti. According to documents seen by CNN, the mission will be helmed by a Kenyan police commissioner and a Jamaican police lieutenant, with other top posts filled by Kenyan staff. The Bahamas, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belize, Benin, Chad, and Jamaica have also promised to contribute personnel to the mission. Although the MSS was approved more than seven months ago, it has been mired in complications, including court challenges in Kenya and political tumult in Haiti. In March, a surge of gang violence forced then-Prime Minister Ariel Henry to resign shortly after inking a deal with Kenya for the mission; Ruto\u2019s administration has since found a new partner in Haiti\u2019s Transitional Presidential Council, established last month. During the Thursday press conference, journalist Ayub Abdikadir from Kenya\u2019s Citizen TV questioned Ruto on the strategy of sending forces to a crisis in the distant Caribbean while security problems endure in Kenya\u2019s North Rift region. \u201cWhy are you committing to Kenya when we have a problem back home?\u201d he asked. Kenya\u2019s responsibility is broader than its own borders, Ruto responded, underlining that troops and police had already been deployed to \u201csort out the banditry problem\u201d in the North Rift. A UN-managed trust fund for the mission currently contains $21 million, provided by Canada ($8.7 million), the United States ($6 million), France ($3.2 million) and Spain ($3 million), according to the UN. The US and Canada have also committed more, much of it expected to take the form of equipment and other resources. Why hasn\u2019t the MSS begun yet? (A shortage of medevac helicopters, in part) May 23 had been the working deadline for a first instalment of 200 Kenyan police officers to arrive, according to documents seen by CNN. Several dozen Jamaican officers were expected to arrive in Haiti by mid-June, with more trickling in through the summer. This week, a Kenyan team including several police commanders visited Port-au-Prince to assess whether facilities were ready to accommodate a deployment. A base for the MSS near Toussaint Louverture airport in Port-au-Prince is close to completion \u2013 boasting a medical facility and a trauma surgeon already on site \u2013 but the Kenyan delegation concluded that some equipment was insufficient. They were particularly concerned by a lack of helicopters for medical evacuations, multiple sources said, citing confusion over which nation would provide them. Kenyan authorities did not respond to CNN\u2019s requests for comment. Documents seen by CNN show that El Salvador had been floated as a potential provider of medevac helicopters, which Salvadoran Vice President Felix Ulloa played down as unlikely in comments to CNN. \u201cWe would like to be part of the solution, but we would need a mandate clearly from the United Nations and the acceptance of the host country,\u201d he said, adding that El Salvador could potentially offer its highly trained helicopter pilots and experts to oversee air operations for the MSS if called upon. More equipment, including armored vehicles and radios, is expected to arrive in Haiti for the MSS over the coming days and weeks. What now? Experts on the ground say the Haitian government also has more work to do to lay the groundwork for the mission, particularly in communicating with the public \u2013 and even the gangs \u2013 about how it will work. One source with experience in dealing with Haiti\u2019s gangs said the Transitional Presidential Council should be developing messaging to the gangs themselves about potential \u201coff-ramps\u201d from outright confrontation with the MSS, potentially by turning themselves in or otherwise seeking nonviolent resolution. Haitian police union SPNH17 meanwhile told CNN that plans for their collaboration with the international mission were too opaque and questioned why there wasn\u2019t more focus on providing material support to the local police. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is the international community working with a few sectors with no clear plans on what they\u2019ll do and how. We don\u2019t even know how we will communicate with the Kenyan police officers who speaks English. We speak French and Creole in Haiti,\u201d the union said in a statement. \u201cWe believe only the Haitian police can provide long term security for Haiti. What we need are materials and logistical support.\u201d Haitian anti-corruption group Nou Pap D\u00f2mi (NPD) echoed the concern about transparency, noting that there needs to be clear mechanisms of accountability for the foreign forces\u2019 conduct in Haiti. \u201cWhile NPD believes that international support is necessary to address the crisis, we have always advocated for an approach that focuses primarily on strengthening the Haitian National Police so that it can address these challenges with lasting effect,\u201d the group said in a statement to CNN. Amid the continuing uncertainty this week about when the MSS will come, NPD said: \u201cThe Kenyan mission remains a mystery to the Haitian people; no one knows what it entails and there has been no communication on the matter, despite the arrival of several US military planes in Haiti.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/americas/haiti-gang-mss-kenya-explainer-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_02_style_aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl", "text": "Miami has a new addition to its skyline \u2013 a 66-story residential tower built by Aston Martin, marking the British luxury sports carmaker\u2019s first foray into the residential real estate market. Comprising of 391 units, Aston Martin Residences Miami sits at the mouth of the Miami River on Biscayne Bay, the firm said in a statement Tuesday. Designed in partnership with architect Rodolfo Miani of Bodas Mian Anger and built by G&G Business Developments, the 249-meter- (818-foot-) tall building houses seven penthouses, each with private pools and terraces, as well as apartments ranging in size from one to five bedrooms. The largest unit is the \u201cUnique Triplex Penthouse,\u201d arranged over three floors at the top of the building, which remains on the market for $59 million. The property was officially opened on Tuesday. Timed to coincide with the Formula One Miami Grand Prix, the company said in a statement that it marks \u201cthe latest distinct expression of Aston Martin\u2019s ultra-luxury high performance brand.\u201d Featuring an infinity pool with a pool deck, jacuzzis and cabanas on the 55th floor, the sail-shaped complex has a two-floor fitness center, two movie theaters and a virtual golf simulator. The building has a sky bar and lounge, chef\u2019s kitchen, ballroom and private dining areas, as well as a spa, beauty salon and barber shop. Direct access to the sea via a superyacht marina is also available, plus a private butler service. Germ\u00e1n Coto, chief executive officer of G&G Business Developments, told CNN Tuesday that the firm wanted to work on a project in the \u201ccosmopolitan city\u201d of Miami, and that this piece of land was the perfect choice. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing plot with an excellent view of the river,\u201d said Coto. The structure\u2019s aerodynamic shape helps the building deal with the technical challenges presented by high winds in the area, as well as evoking the sleek shape of an Aston Martin, according to Marek Reichman, executive vice president and chief creative officer of Aston Martin. It also becomes wider from the base to the mid-section before tightening once more towards the top, making it appear to bow out over people on street level, Reichman told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the drama,\u201d he added. Challenges However, the process wasn\u2019t all plain sailing. \u201cIt was difficult to achieve what we wanted because the space and the plot is kind of small,\u201d said Coto, with the building fitting into a 1.25-acre plot of land. Meanwhile, local building regulations imposed strict standards, explained Reichman, taking into account the low-lying land and propensity for flooding. \u201cThey were some of the most amazing challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to withstand the flooding with the windows that are on street level.\u201d There were further obstacles due to the curved shape of the building, which means that units on the east side have an individual architectural structural component. Aston Martin touches Homeowners are able to customize their interior space with the help of the Aston Martin design team, with three style packages \u2013 Timeless, Covert and Indulgent \u2013 drawing on the company\u2019s British heritage, as well as the building\u2019s context. \u201cIt needs to have part of the DNA of an Aston Martin,\u201d Reichman said. \u201cBut we are in Miami, you don\u2019t have a cold November evening where you need to put the log fire on, so you\u2019ve got to be considerate of the environment that you\u2019re in.\u201d Design elements running through the building include doors with bespoke Aston Martin handles, number plinths and kestrel tan leather door tabs. Aston Martin said that 99% of the properties sold before the building was completed. Residences were sold for $1.5 million to $8.5 million, while penthouses ranged from $16 million to $59 million. The Unique Triplex Penthouse, on the market for $59 million, comes with the last remaining Aston Martin Vulcan, an 820 brake horsepower all-carbon fiber supercar, of which only 24 exist, a spokesman for the company said. Meanwhile, buyers of the 47 Signature and Penthouse units were also able to choose between an Aston Martin DBX sports SUV or the company\u2019s DB11 sportscar. Aston Martin isn\u2019t the first luxury carmaker to enter the residential property market. A 63-story building from Bentley will open in 2026 along the coastline of Sunny Isles Beach, Florida. Featuring 216 units, the property will have an elevator designed to take residents up to their doorstep while seated inside their cars.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/02/style/aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "world"}}

Judge Sof\u00eda Gil Garc\u00eda ruled that soccer\u2019s world governing body FIFA and its European counterpart UEFA have abused their position of power and are impeding free market competition by granting themselves the discretional power to prohibit participation in alternative competitions and imposing unfair and disproportionate restrictions. Both organizations have been instructed to \u201cimmediately remove all the effects of their anticompetitive actions produced as a result of the filing of this procedure.\u201d The Spanish court\u2019s judgment echoes the\u00a0Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU)\u2019s\u00a0December 2023 ruling, which stated FIFA and UEFA rules demanding prior approval for establishing a new competition \u2013 such as the ESL \u2013 and prohibiting clubs and players from playing in them were \u201cunlawful.\u201d A22, the management company formed to sponsor and assist in the formation of the ESL, welcomed the ruling describing it as an \u201cimportant step towards a truly competitive and sustainable club football landscape in Europe.\u201d \u201cUEFA\u2019s statutes and the aggressive actions taken to protect its monopoly have stifled innovation for decades and clubs should not have to fear threats of sanctions simply for having ideas and conversations,\u201d A22 CEO Bernd Reichart said in a statement on Monday. \u201cThe era of the monopoly is now definitively over,\u201d Reichart added. However, in response to the ruling, UEFA said \u201cthe court has not given the green light to, nor has it approved, projects like the Super League.\u201d \u201cIn fact, the judge has asserted that the Super League project has long been abandoned and that she cannot be expected to rule on any abstract projects. \u201cIn short, the judgment does not give third parties the right to develop competitions without authorisation and does not concern any future project or indeed any modified version of an existing project,\u201d UEFA said in the statement sent to CNN Sport. \u201cIt will take time to study the judgment before deciding whether any further action is necessary,\u201d added UEFA. FIFA and UEFA can appeal the ruling to a separate section of the Madrid Provincial Court. CNN has reached out to FIFA for comment. The ESL saga began on April 18, 2021, when 12 of Europe\u2019s biggest, most successful and financially powerful clubs announced their intention to break away from the current UEFA club competition format and create a\u00a0Super League.\u00a0The idea was to guarantee 15 clubs a place in a 20-team competition every season, regardless of performance on the pitch. The 20 teams would be made up of the 12 founding members as well as three other permanent unnamed clubs and five others who would qualify every year. However, after vehement opposition from fans and the wider public \u2013 with many saying it was a power grab intended to guarantee the Super League\u2019s founding members status and revenue \u2013 the plans were scrapped just 48 hours later, though Spanish giants Real Madrid and Barcelona remained committed to the project. CNN has sought comment from Real Madrid and Bar\u00e7a. The Spanish court\u2019s ruling comes just days before UEFA\u2019s showpiece Champions League final between 14-time winner Real and Borussia Dortmund at Wembley Stadium on Saturday.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/sport/super-league-spanish-court-fifa-uefa-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "world"}}

Conille was chosen by consensus after the council conducted hearings of candidates, Leblanc Fils said. Conille briefly served as prime minister from 2011 to 2012 during the presidency of Michel Martelly. He is currently the UNICEF Regional Director for Latin America and the Caribbean. His appointment is a key step in the reconstruction of Haiti\u2019s government, following the ouster of former Prime Minister Ariel Henry earlier this year. The new prime minister and the nine-member council must also select a cabinet and eventually lead Haiti to new elections. Since February, attacks by an insurgent alliance of gangs in the capital Port-au-Prince mean the city\u2019s international airport and seaport have ceased to function, breaking vital supply lines of food and aid and triggering an exodus of evacuation flights for foreign nationals. The violence erupted while Henry was in Kenya to secure its commitment to a multinational security mission meant to bolster Haiti\u2019s national police. But the then-leader was unable to return to the country amid the bloodshed, and ultimately announced his resignation in March. The resignation pitched the country\u2019s political establishment into weeks of negotiations as they sought to muster a transitional government. The inauguration of the CARICOM-backed presidential council in April has since allowed Haiti to resume planning for the much-delayed foreign mission. That foreign mission, led by Kenya, is now expected to arrive sometime in June. While some commercial flights to Port-au-Prince have tentatively restarted, the city remains\u00a0largely cut off\u00a0from the outside world. Across the nation, nearly 5 million people in Haiti are suffering from acute food insecurity \u2013 defined as when a person\u2019s inability to consume adequate food poses immediate danger to their life or livelihood.

Last week\u2019s drills were the largest China has launched in more than a year and came days after Taiwan\u00a0swore in its new president,\u00a0Lai Ching-te, who is openly loathed by Beijing for championing the island\u2019s sovereignty and distinct identity. In a news conference in Taipei, US Representative\u00a0Michael McCaul, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, called the drills an \u201cintimidation tactic to punish democracy\u201d and vowed to bolster Taiwan\u2019s defense by speeding up the delivery of defensive weapons from the US. Citing recent\u00a0foreign military financing\u00a0for\u00a0Taiwan approved by the US House, McCaul pledged to get Taiwan the weapons it purchased from the US \u201cas soon as possible.\u201d \u201cWe are moving forward on those weapons systems. I\u2019d like to see them faster, but they are forthcoming,\u201d he said. The US maintains close but informal relations with Taiwan and is bound by law to supply the island with weapons to defend itself. However, Taiwan has repeatedly raised concerns about delays in US weapon deliveries, particularly after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. \u201cPresident Lai and I have always had a very sobering and yet very direct conversation about the threat that this island faces from its neighbor to the north,\u201d McCaul said, referring to China. China\u2019s ruling Communist Party views Taiwan as part of its territory, despite never having controlled it, and has vowed to take the island by force if necessary. China\u2019s military kicked off two days of exercises last Thursday, sending warships and fighter jets around Taiwan and its outlying islands in\u00a0what it called \u201ca strong punishment for separatist acts of Taiwan independence forces.\u201d It said the drills were designed to test its ability to \u201cseize power\u201d over the island. Beijing has long denounced Lai as a \u201cdangerous separatist\u201d and decried his inauguration speech, during which he called on China to cease its intimidation of Taiwan. The vast majority of Taiwanese have no desire to live under Chinese rule. But under Xi Jinping, China\u2019s most authoritarian leader in a generation, Beijing has grown more assertive\u00a0and ramped up diplomatic, economic and military pressure on its democratic neighbor. In the often bitterly polarized atmosphere of Capitol Hill support for Taiwan has become one of the few bipartisan points of agreement. \u201cWithout deterrence, Chairman Xi has bold and aggressive ambitions, and we just need to do everything we can to make it possible for him to see that the risk outweighs the reward, that the risk is too high. I do think the deterrence we will provide, and we\u2019re providing by our presence here today, will help prevent that,\u201d McCaul, a Republican,\u00a0said. China\u2019s Foreign Ministry said it \u201cfirmly opposed\u201d the visit and had lodged stern representations with the US. It urged the American lawmakers to \u201cstop playing the Taiwan card, stop interfering in China\u2019s internal affairs, stop supporting and condoning Taiwan independence separatist forces, and stop undermining Sino-US relations and peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait,\u201d ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a regular news conference Monday. \u2018Gesture of solidarity\u2019 Taiwan\u2019s Foreign Minister\u00a0Lin Chia-lung called the visit by US lawmakers \u201ca powerful display of the strong bipartisan support of Taiwan in the United States.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s also an important gesture of solidarity that shows America stands firmly with democratic Taiwan, and for this, we are deeply grateful,\u201d Lin said at the news conference alongside McCaul, vowing to advance the \u201crock-solid partnership\u201d between the two sides. China\u2019s military drills, he said, were \u201cto express their displeasure with President Lai, a president democratically elected by the people of Taiwan.\u201d But he added they had another objective. \u201cI believe the military exercises were also the PRC way of welcoming this delegation,\u201d he said, referring to China\u2019s official name the People\u2019s Republic of China. The delegation also met with Lai, Taiwan\u2019s new leader, on Monday morning. Calling McCaul \u201cTaiwan\u2019s longtime friend,\u201d Lai thanked the delegation for their firm support for Taiwan and vowed to deepen cooperation with the US and other like-minded countries to maintain regional peace, stability and prosperity. \u201cI deeply admire former US President Ronald Reagan\u2019s concept of \u2018peace through strength.\u2019 Therefore, moving forward, I\u2019ll enhance reform and bolster national defense, showing the world the Taiwanese people\u2019s determination to defend their homeland,\u201d Lai said. \u201cWith your support, I hope that the US Congress through legislative action will continue to assist Taiwan in strengthening its self-defense capabilities, thereby advancing bilateral exchanges and cooperation.\u201d In response, McCaul congratulated Lai for assuming the presidency, saying \u201cTaiwan has the right man at the right time in the right place.\u201d \u201cWe must make sure no one in the right mind will try to upset the peace that let you thrive,\u201d McCaul told Lai. \u201cAmerican is and will always be a reliable partner, and no amount of coercion or intimidation will slow down or stop the routine visits by the congress to Taiwan.\u201d McCaul last visited Taiwan in April 2023 and met former President Tsai Ing-wen. China responded with a show of military force and later imposed sanctions on McCaul. In August 2022, China staged massive war games around Taiwan to show its displeasure with then US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s visit to Taipei. Beijing fired missiles into waters surrounding the island and simulated a blockade with fighter jets and warships, in its largest show of force in years.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/27/asia/us-congressional-visit-taiwan-defense-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_28_style_italy-stolen-artifacts-returned-intl-scli", "text": "It looked more like a museum exhibition of Italian art than a crime scene, but in the Central Institute for Restoration\u2019s offices, located inside a former women\u2019s prison in central Rome, some 600 works of art were put on display Tuesday morning. Ranging\u00a0from life-sized bronze statues to tiny Roman coins,\u00a0from\u00a0oil paintings to mosaic flooring, the pieces span the 9th century BC to the 2nd century AD\u00a0and amount\u00a0to just one year\u2019s stolen and trafficked art confiscated by Manhattan prosecutor Col. Matthew Bogdanos\u2019 team and returned to Italy. The trafficked works, pillaged from the Italian regions of Lazio, Campania, Puglia, Calabria and Sicily, were sequestered in New York and New Jersey\ufeff\u00a0last year. The returned works, together with 60 items repatriated\u00a0last year, are worth more than $80 million (or roughly \u20ac73.6 million) \u2014 but are just a drop in the bucket when it comes to artwork still hidden away in private warehouses and on display in museums in the United States, Bogdanos told CNN on the sidelines of\u00a0a\u00a0presentation\u00a0to the media on Tuesday. Bogdanos said the $80 million of items does not include a further 100 items his team has just seized in the US. What makes the seizure and return of stolen artifacts so difficult is that authorities often have no idea what they are looking for, according to Gen. D. Francesco Gargaro, commander of the Carabinieri for the Protection of Cultural Heritage. \u201cWhen artifacts are taken from clandestine graves, they have never been\u00a0cataloged,\u201d he said. That means that, in addition to the items themselves, their historical context was stolen, robbing archaeologists of valuable\u00a0information. (Instead,\u00a0investigators work backwards, assessing paperwork and provenance claims for artifacts provided by their owners, as well as undertaking technical tests to best confirm a piece\u2019s true origins.) Most of the recent items returned to Italy were dug out of clandestine excavations or stolen from churches, museums and private individuals,\u00a0Gargaro\u00a0said. Among the items on display\u00a0\ufeffon Tuesday\u00a0was a cuirass and two bronze heads dating back to the 4th-3rd century BC\u00a0that were\u00a0confiscated from\u00a0a\u00a0gallery owner in New York. There was also\u00a0an Umbrian bronze statue depicting a warrior stolen from an Italian museum in 1962\u00a0that was\u00a0found in a well-known American museum. And a mosaic floor depicting the myth of Orpheus enchanting wild animals with the sound of the lyre from the mid-3rd to mid-4th century AD\u00a0was recovered after being\u00a0stolen from a clandestine excavation in Sicily in the early 1990s.\u00a0It was\u00a0confiscated from the private collection of a well-known New York collector. Italy\u2019s Carabinieri Cultural Heritage Protection unit uses artificial intelligence to search for stolen cultural assets under a new program called \u201cStolen Works Of Art Detection System\u201d (SWOADS), which searches for\u00a0\ufefftaken items\u00a0by scanning the web and social media for images. \u201cThe return to Italy of cultural assets of such importance, both for their numerical consistency and for their historical-artistic value, is another significant achievement, Italy\u2019s culture ministry undersecretary Gianmarco Mazzi said Tuesday. \u201cIn addition to being works of art of inestimable value, they represent the high expression of our history, our culture and our national identity.\u201d In 2023 alone, 105,474 pieces of art worth more than \u20ac264 million\u00a0(or $287 million)\u00a0were found and confiscated worldwide thanks to the artificial intelligence project, according to\u00a0Gargaro.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/style/italy-stolen-artifacts-returned-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "world"}}

Andreas Pernerstorfer made the incredible discovery while renovating his wine cellar in the village of Gobelsburg, about 70 kilometers (43 miles) northwest of Vienna, in March. The find has been described as the most significant of its kind in more than a century, with researchers from the Austrian Academy of Sciences (OeAW), who are now recovering the bones, describing it as an \u201carchaeological sensation,\u201d according to a Wednesday press release. Pernerstorfer had decided to carry out some work to level the floor in the cellar, archaeologist Hannah Parow\u2013 Souchon, a researcher at the OeAW, told CNN in a video call Thursday. \u201cHe wanted to level the floor of his wine cellar because it was sloping and he removed some concrete in the center,\u201d she said. \u201cMore or less immediately he found the bones, which he initially thought were wood. Then he looked more closely and remembered a tale from his grandfather who in the sixties extended the cellar and found some mammoth molars.\u201d Pernerstorfer reported the find to the Federal Monuments Office, which referred him to the OeAW because, as Parow-Souchon told CNN, \u201cwe are experts on the Stone Age.\u201d She and her team of fellow archaeologists embarked on an excavation at the start of May. \u201cIt quickly became apparent that it wasn\u2019t just a few mammoth bones but very many mammoth bones,\u201d she said. Parow-Souchon said they have \u201cat least 300 bones,\u201d which were found densely packed together. \u201cWe think we have mostly the complete animals. They\u2019re not in anatomical connection but we do have probably all parts,\u201d she said, adding that the recovered haul includes some rare finds, including a lingual (tongue) bone.\u201d The archaeologists believe the bones are from three separate mammoths. The site they excavated was just 12 square meters (129 square feet) big, but they are hoping to return in August to continue with their search. \u201cI love being an archaeologist. I\u2019ve excavated lots of exciting things but I always wanted to excavate a mammoth,\u201d said Parow-Souchon, adding that the mammoth bone discovery was a first for her. \u201cI\u2019m thrilled, I can\u2019t deny it,\u201d she said. Comparable sites elsewhere in Austria and in neighboring countries were mostly excavated more than 100 years ago, which means they are not available for modern research. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve been able to investigate something like this in Austria using modern methods. It is a unique opportunity for research,\u201d said Parow-Souchon in the press release. The excavations, funded by the Federal Monuments Office and the province of Lower Austria, raise many questions, including whether these animals were killed by Stone Age hunters. \u201cWe know that humans hunted mammoths, but we still know very little about how they did it,\u201d said Parow-Souchon, adding that a trap for the animals may have been set at this site. Once the researchers complete their work, the bones will be passed to the Natural History Museum Vienna for restoration.

He just keeps making me do things.\u201d Since assuming power in 2014, Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have promoted a strident brand of Hindu nationalism in a country where about 80% of the population are followers of the polytheistic faith. And while he has used such language in the past, his message of being a leader chosen by God has become much more apparent as attempts to win a third consecutive five-year term in power. Throughout India\u2019s mammoth weeks-long\u00a0national election, which declares results on June 4, Modi has given multiple media interviews and speeches that echo the comments made to NDTV. He has taken on the persona of an openly devout Hindu, said Subir Sinha, Director of the South Asia Institute at SOAS University of London. This, he added has \u201crallied his base who feel pride in such religiosity.\u201d India is a deeply religious country. But historically its post-Independence leaders have remained publicly secular, in part to avoid being seen to pander to any one side in a nation with a long history of inter-religious violence. \u201c(He is) the first prime minister, they say, to be unashamed about this faith,\u201d Sinha said. When he first contested elections a decade ago, Modi chose India\u2019s spiritual capital Varanasi as his constituency, making the ancient city the perfect backdrop to meld his religious and political ambitions. \u201cMother Ganga has called me to Varanasi,\u201d Modi said at the time, referring to the holy Ganges River, considered to be the body of the Hindu deity Ganga by many followers of the faith. Standing on its banks earlier this month, Modi made another reference to his perceived divinity. \u201cUntil my mother was alive, I had believed that perhaps my birth was a biological one,\u201d Modi told CNN affiliate CNN News-18. \u201cBut after her death, when I look at my life experiences, I\u2019m convinced that God has sent me here.\u201d God has, Modi said, made him \u201cnothing but an instrument.\u201d Modi\u2019s grandest display of divinity was on display in January this year, when he consecrated the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya, a controversial Hindu temple that was built on the site of a destroyed mosque. Billboards celebrating the temple\u2019s opening featured an image of Hindu deity Ram alongside Modi\u2019s face, with the leader of his BJP even\u00a0dubbing\u00a0the prime minister \u201cThe King of Gods.\u201d Modi fasted for 11 days in a purification ritual before the event and visited temples across the country, performing customs sacramental to India\u2019s majority faith. He publicly called himself \u201can instrument\u201d of Lord Ram, picked by the divine to \u201crepresent all the people of India.\u201d At the consecration, Modi presided over the \u201cPran Pratishtha\u201d \u2013 the unveiling of the much-anticipated Ram idol \u2013 taking on a role typically reserved for priests. During the election Modi has also sparked a row over hate speech when he accused Muslims \u2013 who have been part of India for centuries \u2013 of being \u201cinfiltrators,\u201d and echoing a false conspiracy voiced by some Hindu nationalists that Muslims are displacing the country\u2019s Hindu population by deliberately having large families. It ignited widespread anger among Muslim leaders and opposition politicians and calls for election authorities to investigate. BJP party spokespeople subsequently said Modi was talking about undocumented migrants. The election commission has asked the BJP to respond to the allegations.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/india/india-narendra-modi-chosen-by-god-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "world"}}

Its consistent wind makes it a hotspot for kitesurfing enthusiasts, but a new port, currently halfway through construction, could turn the area into a gateway for trade. The $1.2 billion megaproject is expected to complete in 2028. Spanning 1,650 hectares, the complex will include a trade port with an oil terminal, a fishing port and a shipyard. There will be a bridge linking the port to the land and a 7-kilometer road that connects the port with a national highway that runs along the coast as far north as Tangier and as far south as the border with Mauritania. \u201cWe\u2019re constructing an ecosystem,\u201d Nisrine Iouzzi, the director of construction for the Dakhla Atlantic Port, tells CNN. Once operational, she expects the port to handle 35 million tons of goods a year. This will not only boost Morocco\u2019s economy, she says, but it could help the country become a maritime hub for worldwide trade, connecting regions such as West Africa, the Middle East, Europe, North America, the Canary Islands and even South America. \u201cThe geographic location is key (to) the success of the port,\u201d she says, adding that the project has attracted significant foreign investment, including from the United Arab Emirates. Gateway to Africa The project is part of Morocco\u2019s national port strategy, which aims to modernize and strengthen port infrastructure by 2030, in order to enhance its role in global supply chains. Seaports such as Casablanca, Tanger-Med and Agadir have already been or are being upgraded, but because of its location, the Dakhla port is seen as particularly significant in opening up\u00a0other parts of the African continent for the world to trade with. \u201cWe strongly believe that with this infrastructure \u2013 port infrastructure, road infrastructure, renewable energy \u2013 we will be very attractive for investors that aim to get to one of the fastest growing markets, which is the West African market,\u201d says Mounir Houari, general manager of Dakhla\u2019s Regional Investment Center. With the implementation of Africa\u2019s continental free trade agreement, which aims to create a single market for goods and services, the port could encourage the processing of raw materials within the continent. \u201cLess than 5% of African natural resources are processed in Africa because there is no industrial infrastructure and exporting infrastructure,\u201d says Houari. The Dakhla port \u201cwill encourage many Africans to start processing natural resources in Africa, allowing African countries to create more jobs to improve their skills and know-how and strengthen their own industries.\u201d The Sahel region, especially landlocked countries such as Mali, Chad, Niger and Burkina Faso, are expected to benefit. Houari explains that Morocco has granted the region access to its road and port infrastructure, providing \u201ca door to the Atlantic maritime trade.\u201d Turloch Mooney, head of port intelligence and analytics at research firm S&P Global Market Intelligence, says the development could be beneficial to the region. \u201cIt is very positive to see modern port and trade infrastructure being developed in the Western Sahara where there is potential to support a large hinterland in West Africa and the Sahel,\u201d he says. \u201cQuality port infrastructure and efficient port operations is part of the package of assurance for foreign direct investment and has been a key factor in the successful growth strategies of many developing countries.\u201d But Western Sahara and the Sahel region has a long history of unrest. \u201cLocal disputes can make developing port infrastructure and reliable logistics much more challenging,\u201d says Mooney. He cautions that infrastructure alone won\u2019t drive trade growth in the region, and that the port\u2019s success will depend on good governance, reliable transport connections and political stability.", "source": "http://cnn.com/world/africa/new-atlantic-port-of-dakhla-africa-trade-spc-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "world"}}

Irish Prime Minister Simon Harris said his country made the decision, which was strongly condemned by Israel, \u201cto keep the miracle of peace alive.\u201d The nations had announced they would take this step last week, but on Tuesday their respective governments simultaneously approved the declaration, meaning it has now officially come into effect. The move also highlights just how split Europe is on whether to recognize Palestinian statehood. A majority of countries around the world do so, and reaffirmed that stance this month in a United Nations resolution in support of Palestinian membership that passed with the support of 143 nations. Among them were many European states. But it is difficult to be truly definitive about how many countries view the issue; some former Eastern bloc countries, for example, recognized Palestinian statehood decades ago while under Soviet rule, but have since distanced themselves from that stance as independent countries. Spain, Ireland and Norway The move by these three countries to recognize Palestinian statehood in tandem sent an impactful message to Israel, and other Western states. Harris said in a statement on Tuesday that Ireland \u201chad wanted to recognise Palestine at the end of a peace process,\u201d but ultimately \u201cmade this move alongside Spain and Norway to keep the miracle of peace alive\u201d \u2013 underlining how the joint declaration gave each nation some level of cover, and may have accelerated the process. \u201cI again call on Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel to listen to the world and stop the humanitarian catastrophe we are seeing in Gaza,\u201d Harris said. \u201cIt is regrettable that the Israeli government shows no signs of engaging constructively,\u201d the Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide added as his country formalized the move on Tuesday. \u201cThe international community must increase its political and economic support for Palestine and continue the work for a two-state solution.\u201d In Madrid, Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez said in a nationally televised address that Spain would join \u201cmore than 140 countries that already recognize Palestine\u201d and that it \u201cis the only way to realize the solution that we all recognize as the only possible one to achieve a future of peace: that of a Palestinian state that coexists alongside the state of Israel in peace and security.\u201d But all three countries have received a furious response from Israel since announcing their decision last week. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz ordered the immediate recall of its ambassadors to the trio, and said in a statement: \u201cI am sending a clear message today \u2013 Israel will not hold back against those who undermine its sovereignty and endanger its security.\u201d \u201cAfter the terrorist organization Hamas carried out the largest massacre of Jews since the Holocaust, after it committed the most horrific sex crimes the world has seen, these countries chose to give a reward to Hamas and Iran and recognize a Palestinian state,\u201d Katz added. Western Europe In 2014, Sweden became the first major Western European nation to recognize Palestinian statehood. Swedish Foreign Minister Margot Wallstrom said the decision was made because it \u201cmet the criteria of international law.\u201d \u201cIn the light of the international law analysis, we see no reason to delay this decision,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is a territory of people and a government. Not to recognize Palestine because of the occupation would be against the principle of international law about no fruits of aggression.\u201d But that move did not lead to a groundswell of Western European support for the declaration. Instead, some countries have inched towards supporting Palestinian statehood as part of their wider advocacy for a two-state solution, but have not yet taken the step of formal recognition. Notably, France, Belgium, Poland and Greece voted in favor of the May 10 UN General Assembly resolution that called for Palestinian membership of the UN earlier this month. Denmark was also among the countries that voted \u201cYes.\u201d But on Tuesday, as its neighbor Norway formalized its recognition, Denmark\u2019s parliament voted down a proposal to do so, Reuters reported. Other countries \u2013 including the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands \u2013 abstained from the UN vote, which was significant but ultimately symbolic given the United States\u2019 veto. In total, 143 votes were passed in favor of the UN resolution, 25 nations abstained and nine voted against. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz\u00a0said Friday that the time for a German recognition had not yet come, as there is \u201cno clarity on the territory of the state.\u201d For now, it\u2019s about achieving a long-term ceasefire,\u201d Scholz said. \u201cThe path of symbolic recognition of\u00a0statehood\u00a0is not the way forward.\u201d Eastern Europe Officially, a number of countries that previously fell under the Soviet sphere of influence in eastern Europe recognize Palestinian statehood. Hungary, the Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria all take that stance, Reuters reported on Tuesday. But in eastern Europe, that recognition is often complicated, given that the order to formalize ties was given under a Soviet regime that sought to disrupt American global partnerships, such as that with Israel. Some former Soviet-bloc countries, such as Poland, have maintained close ties with Palestinian authorities, and have visited or hosted leaders from the Palestinian Authority in Ramallah. Others have since distanced themselves from their historical declaration of support for Palestinian statehood, such as the Czech Republic, which was one of just nine countries to vote against the UNGA resolution earlier this month. The other nations were Hungary, Argentina, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Israel and the United States. Slovenia\u2019s government will consider a proposal this week to recognize an independent Palestinian state, according to Prime Minister Robert Golob. Golob said in a statement that \u201cafter a series of consultations over the last few days,\u201d a government meeting on Thursday will consider forwarding \u201cthe recognition of Palestine\u201d to the country\u2019s legislature for approval.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/middleeast/spain-ireland-norway-recognize-palestinian-statehood-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "world"}}
