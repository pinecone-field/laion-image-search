{"id": "2024_06_29_europe_france-parliament-election-polls-open-intl", "text": "France has seen the highest turnout in decades as voting in the first round of snap parliamentary elections neared the end. The election could oust President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s centrist alliance and leave him to see out the remaining three years of his term in an awkward partnership with the far right. Estimates published by Ipsos polling say the total voter turnout on Sunday is expected to be 65.5%, the highest France has seen in a first round of parliamentary elections since 1997. The estimates marks an 18 point increase compared to 2022. Voting began at 8 a.m. local time (2 a.m. ET), as France started the process of electing the 577 members of its National Assembly through locally fought contests across the country and in its overseas territories. The election is being held three years earlier than it needed to be, and three weeks after Macron\u2019s Renaissance party was trounced by the far-right National Rally (RN), the party of Marine Le Pen, in the European Parliament elections. Minutes after the humiliating defeat, in an apparent attempt to call voters\u2019 bluff, Macron said he could not ignore the message sent by voters and took the \u201cserious, heavy\u201d decision to call a snap election \u2013 France\u2019s first since 1997. Whatever the outcome, Macron has pledged to remain in post until France\u2019s next presidential election in 2027. The National Assembly is responsible for passing domestic laws \u2013 from pensions and taxation to immigration and education \u2013 while the president determines the country\u2019s foreign, Europe and defense policy. When the president and majority in parliament belong to the same party, things run well. When they don\u2019t, the government can grind to a halt \u2013 a prospect that could haunt Paris as it prepares to host the summer Olympics next month. France most recently had such a government \u2013 known as \u201ccohabitation\u201d - when right-wing President Jacques Chirac called snap polls and was forced to appoint a socialist, Lionel Jospin, as prime minister, who stayed in the post for five years. The first round of votes eliminates weaker candidates ahead of the second round next Sunday. If a candidate wins an absolute majority of votes in the first ballot on a 25% turnout, they win the seat. Typically, only a handful of deputies will be elected this way \u2013 but most will go to a second round. Only those who win more than 12.5% of ballots cast by registered voters are allowed to stand in the second round. Often this is fought between two candidates, but sometimes three or four. Some candidates choose to drop out at this stage to give their allies a better chance of victory. Most voters will choose one of three blocs: the RN-led far-right alliance; the New Popular Front (NFP), a recently formed left-wing coalition; and Macron\u2019s centrist Ensemble. The RN bloc is headed by Jordan Bardella, the 28-year-old party leader handpicked by Le Pen, who has striven to polish the image of a party historically ridden with racism and antisemitism that proliferated under the decades-long leadership of her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen. Until recently, the prospect of a far-right government was unthinkable. In the past, opposition parties have made marriages of convenience in an attempt to block the RN \u2013 under its previous name, the National Front \u2013 from entering government. Now, within a couple of weeks, Bardella could become France\u2019s prime minister \u2013 and Europe\u2019s youngest in more than two centuries. On the left, a previously fractious cluster of parties have recently banded together to form the New Popular Front \u2013 a coalition meant to resurrect the original Popular Front that prevented fascists from gaining power in 1936. The broad alliance comprises more radical figures like Jean-Luc Melenchon, three-time presidential candidate and leader of the France Unbowed party, as well as moderate leaders like Place Publique\u2019s Raphael Glucksmann. Meanwhile, outgoing French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal \u2013 who was only appointed to his post by Macron in January \u2013 is representing Macron\u2019s centrist Ensemble alliance. Attal was reportedly among the last of Macron\u2019s inner circle to learn that a snap election was imminent. Polls will close at 8 p.m. local time (2 p.m. ET) Sunday, with the full results expected early Monday. CORRECTION: A previous version of this story miscalculated the time polls open in the election.

AfD delegates gathered for the two-day meeting after emerging as a big winner from recent European elections. Police - already stretched by the Euro 2024 tournament - have prepared for a weekend of unrest, with mass counter-demonstrations expected from left-wing groups. Speaking as the event got underway, AfD party co-chair Tino Chrupalla told attendees that AfD membership had grown by 60% since January 2023, Reuters reported. \u201cDespite all the harassment you have to endure as a member of the AfD, this is an absolutely sensational figure,\u201d Chrupalla told the conference. Video footage shared on social media show protesters attempting to break onto the entrance of a motorway, before being stopped by police officers wielding batons and spraying pepper spray. \u201cA large group of people tried to overcome a barrier. Police officers prevented this by using pepper spray and batons,\u201d Essen police wrote in a\u00a0post\u00a0on X. A\u00a0video\u00a0posted Saturday morning by Widersetzen, the group organizing the protests, showed dozens of people gathered, clapping and chanting. According to the organization, around 7,000 Widersetzen protesters were on the streets of Essen on Saturday morning, with more expected in the afternoon. On the\u00a0action page\u00a0of Widersetzen\u2019s website, the group has called for \u201ccolorful\u201d civil disobedience during the AfD congress, without resorting to violence or escalation. It states that protesters must disrupt the AfD\u2019s activities to \u201cprevent the spread of fascism.\u201d According to German media reports, police are expecting up to 100,000 protesters to turn out on Saturday, including around 1,000 left-wing extremists who are prone to violence. German newspaper Bild reported several arrests on Saturday. According to the publication, one AfD politician had to be freed from a bakery by police officers after the shop was surrounded by an aggressive mob of demonstrators. The politician was then escorted to the conference hall under police protection. The AfD\u2019s party conference comes after winning its best EU election result in its history earlier this month, securing the second-highest share of votes in Germany behind only the center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU). Its recent voting success comes despite the party being embroiled in a series of scandals. In May, prominent AfD politician Maximilian Krah drew condemnation after suggesting not all members of the Nazi SS were criminals. His comments prompted a far-right coalition of parties in the European Parliament to expel the AfD. Krah also caused friction within his party, with the AfD saying his statements had caused \u201cmassive damage\u201d to their election campaign.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/29/europe/protest-afd-congress-essen-germany-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_europe_france-debate-attal-bardella-bompard-intl", "text": "Three of France\u2019s highest-profile candidates in the country\u2019s upcoming legislative elections sparred in the first major debate of the campaign on Tuesday. Prime Minister Gabriel Attal squared off against Jordan Bardella, the president of the far-right National Rally, and Manuel Bompard of the leftist alliance dubbed the New Popular Front in a wide-ranging, sometimes chaotic two-hour affair. Attal, 35, and Bardella, 28, are two of the country\u2019s youngest and most popular politicians.\u00a0After serving in various positions in Macron\u2019s government, Attal was named the youngest prime minister in French history earlier this year. Bardella led the National Rally to a dominant showing at the European elections on June 9. Bompard, 38, does not have the same sort of name recognition or leadership position. He was elected to the French National Assembly in 2022 representing Marseille and is a member of the far-left political party France Unbowed. None of the three candidates appeared to land any knockout blows or move the needle enough to sway the opinion of voters. Bardella didn\u2019t appear to sufficiently address criticisms that his party platform is short of specifics. Attal didn\u2019t seem to give angry voters a reason to opt for continuity. And Bompard\u2019s presence on the stage served as a reminder to voters that the left has not yet decided who will lead them if they win the vote. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t really a punchline that was striking or impactful,\u201d said Jean Petaux, a political scientist and expert in French politics. French voters will head to the polls on June 30 and July 7 for a two-round snap election that President Emmanuel Macron called after the National Rally crushed his centrist political movement during the European elections. The move took the French political establishment and society at large by surprise. Not even Attal was aware he was about to lose his job until shortly before the announcement. Macron framed the decision as an exercise in democracy, an opportunity for the French to clarify who they want running the country. But it\u2019s incredibly risky. Macron is gambling that the higher stakes national vote, which draws greater turnout and more scrutiny than European contests, will see the French spurn the National Rally\u2019s anti-immigrant, euroskeptic agenda in favor of more moderate political forces. He\u2019s also assuming that French voters use the runoff, as they have historically, to keep the far right out of power. As things stand, however, Macron will lose his bet. Opinion polls conducted since the snap elections were announced show the National Rally\u2019s momentum has continued to hold, while France\u2019s numerous left-leaning parties have put aside their various ideological differences to jointly field candidates across the country. A survey released on Sunday by pollster IFOP found the National Rally leading all parties with the support of 35% of voters. The New Popular Front, the leftist alliance, came in second with 30% and Macron\u2019s centrist Ensemble dropped to third with 20%. If those results hold, the French legislature would be thrown into a state of political paralysis. No party would amass enough votes to meet the 289-seat threshold for an absolute majority in the 577-seat lower chamber, the National Assembly. Macron\u2019s party is already governing without a majority after its poorer-than-expected showing in the 2022 legislative elections, forcing it to either seek out coalitions to pass legislation or use a constitutional tool to force through new laws \u2013 including last year\u2019s controversial pension reform that raised the retirement age to 64 for most workers \u2013 without a vote. But falling behind to either the left or right could be the death knell to his agenda. A loss would force Macron to nominate a prime minister from whichever party wins \u2013 putting a political opponent in charge of running the government.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/europe/france-debate-attal-bardella-bompard-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_tech_microsoft-teams-eu-antitrust", "text": "Microsoft has violated European Union antitrust laws by bundling Teams with its other popular applications for businesses, EU officials said Tuesday, marking the bloc\u2019s latest challenge to a US tech giant. If confirmed, the preliminary findings of an EU investigation could lead to a fine of up to 10% of Microsoft\u2019s global revenue, which totaled $211 billion in its latest financial year. The announcement comes a day after EU regulators accused Apple (AAPL) of breaching the bloc\u2019s landmark Digital Markets Act, a groundbreaking law that forced big changes on dominant tech platforms after it came into force in March. Apple, which has denied wrongdoing, also faces a huge fine if the charges are confirmed. The actions by the EU could result in changes to the way hundreds of millions of Europeans access services on some of the world\u2019s biggest digital platforms, reflecting a big push by European lawmakers to rein in the power of Big Tech. The European Commission, the EU\u2019s executive arm, opened an investigation into Microsoft\u2019s software practices almost a year ago following a complaint in 2020 by the cloud-based internal messaging app Slack, which is now owned by Salesforce (CRM). Slack alleged that Microsoft (MSFT) had given Teams, which offers messaging, calling and video meetings, an unfair advantage by automatically including it with its Office software and thereby denying Slack an opportunity to compete on a level playing field. The European Commission shares Slack\u2019s worries. \u201cWe are concerned that Microsoft may be giving its own communication product Teams an undue advantage over competitors, by tying it to its popular productivity suites for businesses,\u201d the EU\u2019s competition chief Margrethe Vestager said in statement. \u201cPreserving competition for remote communication and collaboration tools is essential as it also fosters innovation on these markets. If confirmed, Microsoft\u2019s conduct would be illegal under our competition rules,\u201d she added. According to the Commission, Microsoft has been forcing customers to acquire Teams by automatically including the tool in its Office 365 and Microsoft 365 suites. The company\u2019s advantage over rivals \u201cmay have been further exacerbated by interoperability limitations between Teams\u2019 competitors and Microsoft\u2019s offerings. The conduct may have prevented Teams\u2019 rivals from competing, and in turn innovating, to the detriment of customers,\u201d the Commission said. Microsoft announced last year that it would stop the Teams bundling practice in Europe and extended the same commitment globally in April. But, while the Commission acknowledged that the company had started offering \u201csome suites without Teams,\u201d it said it believes \u201cmore changes to Microsoft\u2019s conduct are necessary to restore competition.\u201d In a statement, Microsoft President Brad Smith said: \u201cHaving unbundled Teams and taken initial interoperability steps, we appreciate the additional clarity provided today and will work to find solutions to address the Commission\u2019s remaining concerns.\u201d Salesforce, meanwhile, welcomed the Commission\u2019s findings, calling its actions \u201ca win for customer choice and an affirmation that Microsoft practices with Teams have harmed competition.\u201d This story has been updated with additional information.

{"id": "travel_what-is-canada-day-history-celebrations", "text": "Every year, three days before the US of A sets the skies alight with impressive fireworks displays as part of nationwide Independence Day celebrations, its friendly neighbor to the north pays tribute to its own origin story. That\u2019s right, we\u2019re talking about Canada Day. Many of us Canadians celebrate this annual July 1 holiday much the same way Americans approach Independence Day. We fly that gorgeous red maple leaf proudly and wear Canada-themed outfits. Some people paint their faces. Festivals and fireworks are all part of the proceedings, whether you\u2019re in Vancouver, Toronto or Charlottetown, with barbecues and pancake breakfasts among the culinary traditions of the day. What about jet planes, you ask? Our famed Canadian Forces Snowbirds aerobatics flight demonstration squadron will be making an appearance in our nation\u2019s capital on the big day. But while the two holidays bear many similarities, professor Matthew Hayday, chair\u00a0of the\u00a0Department of History\u00a0at Ontario\u2019s Guelph University, tells CNN that Canadians don\u2019t make \u201cnearly as big a deal out of Canada Day as Americans do about Independence Day.\u201d \u201cThere is a huge celebration in the national capital in Ottawa, which brings tens of thousands of people to Parliament Hill \u2013 those celebrations date back to the late 1950s \u2013 but in most other communities, it is pretty low key, with some communities organizing picnics and barbecues and firework displays, but nothing along the lines of the various parades that you see in the US,\u201d he says. Canada Day\u2019s origin story To fully understand and compare the two, you need to go back. Way back. US Congress established Independence Day as a holiday in\u00a01870 to mark the passage of the Declaration of Independence on\u00a0July 4, 1776. (In response, the British scolded the \u201cmisguided Americans\u201d and \u201ctheir extravagant and inadmissible Claim of Independency\u201d.) Meanwhile, the July 1 holiday to commemorate Canada\u2019s Confederation became official in 1879, and was originally called Dominion Day. It marks the day the British North America Act came into effect in 1867, effectively creating the Dominion of Canada out of three British colonies: the United Province of Canada (now the provinces of Ontario and Quebec), plus New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. \u201cConfederation was an administrative change, not a revolution,\u201d says Forrest\u00a0Pass, curator of Canada\u2019s Library and Archives, via email. \u201cThe editor of the Toronto\u00a0Globe\u00a0\u2013 precursor to the present-day\u00a0Globe and Mail \u2013 put it best in an editorial on (appropriately) July 4, 1875, when he noted that the\u00a0British North America Act\u00a0has \u2018none of the traditional associations of the Declaration of Independence, and is, to most people, only a piece of very dry, practical legislation.\u2019\u201d Even the choice of the date for Confederation was purely administrative, he says, noting the British parliament tended to sit in the early spring and the legislation it passed usually came into effect on July 1 for accounting reasons. But the desire to celebrate Dominion\u00a0Day owed much to the American model, Pass says. Residents of Canadian border towns traveled to nearby American communities to join their events, while some places with large American populations also hosted 4th of July celebrations. \u201cCanadians had celebrated their own holidays before Confederation, especially the birthday of the King or Queen, but even these observances had come to look a lot like Independence Day in the traditions that surrounded them,\u201d he says. For instance, Pass notes that in the United States, no 19th-century Independence Day was complete without a \u201cFederal Salute\u201d of 13 guns for the original 13 states, and a \u201cNational Salute\u201d of one gun for each state then in the Union. Some early Dominion Day celebrations featured a \u2018Dominion Salute\u2019 of one gun for each province. \u201cLike early 4th of July celebrations, early Dominion Day celebrations were spontaneous; they were organized locally with little encouragement from the federal government,\u201d he says, noting that Ottawa started to take an interest in how the day was marked in the 1950s, and encouraged some standardization. At the same time, he says both the media and politicians were quick to remind Canadians of the constitutional difference. \u201cMoreover, some Canadian newspapers in the 1870s took a perverse pleasure in reprinting stories about deaths and injuries during American 4th of July celebrations so that they could point out how peaceful and orderly Dominion Day observances were.\u201d It wasn\u2019t until 1982 that Dominion Day officially became Canada Day. Historian Hayday says there were dozens of half-hearted and more serious attempts to change the name over the years, dating back to the 1940s. In the end, the switch ended up being a bit divisive. \u201cTo this day, there are still pockets of Canadians who resent what they saw as a move away from Canada\u2019s British heritage with the dropping of the term \u2018Dominion\u2019 from the day,\u201d he says. \u201cBut the vast majority of Canadians now accept the \u2018new\u2019 44-year-old name.\u201d Pass, meanwhile, says the name swap was a\u00a0symptom rather than a cause. \u201cChanges to Canada Day, including the name change, have been part of a broader national identity and national unity policy \u2013 think the new national flag in 1965, the formal adoption of\u00a0\u2018O Canada\u2019\u00a0as the national anthem in 1980, and the creation of the Order of Canada as the country\u2019s highest civilian honor,\u201d he says. \u201cCelebrations today typically emphasize Canada as a multicultural and bilingual country rather than a white, British one, consistent with both Canadians\u2019 evolving values and government policy (it\u2019s often hard to say which of these is the cause and which the effect).\u201d So what can visitors to Canada\u2019s capital expect this year as the nation celebrates its 157th birthday? Ottawa\u2019s official Canada Day ceremonies will take place around LeBreton Flats Park and Parliament Hill. The Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF), which turns 100 this year, will mark the occasion with the largest flypast conducted in 20 years over the National Capital Region, at 1 p.m. A series of live musical performances will take place on the main stage from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m., followed by fireworks.

{"id": "2024_04_27_europe_julian-assange-profile-intl-cmd", "text": "Julian Assange\u00a0started his WikiLeaks whistleblowing website on a quest for \u201cradical transparency and truth,\u201d a mission that turned an already polarizing personality into a notorious character and\u00a0earned him\u00a0crusaders and critics\u00a0in equal measure. His\u00a0long-running battle against extradition to the United States had been making its way through UK courts for years until a remarkable plea deal on Monday. Assange, 52, left the UK after agreeing to plead guilty to a single felony charge in exchange for time served. The deal was finalized in a remote US court in the Pacific on Wednesday morning, after which he is expected to return to his native Australia. It has been 12 years since Assange was a free man. He spent the past five years in London\u2019s high-security Belmarsh prison and nearly seven years before that holed up at the Ecuadorian embassy in the English capital,\u00a0trying to avoid arrest. He was facing life imprisonment in the US for publishing hundreds of thousands of sensitive military and government documents supplied by former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning more than a dozen years ago. But recently there has been increased pressure for a resolution to Assange\u2019s case. In April, US President Joe Biden offered\u00a0Assange\u2019s supporters a glimmer of hope saying his administration was\u00a0\u201cconsidering\u201d a request from Australia\u00a0to drop its charges against the WikiLeaks founder. The remarks were described as an \u201cencouraging\u201d signal by Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, who added that Assange had \u201calready paid a significant price\u201d and \u201cenough is enough.\u201d The ascent of Assange Born in Townsville, eastern Queensland, in 1971, Assange had a less than conventional upbringing. His education was a combination of home schooling and correspondence courses, since his family moved frequently. In his teens, he discovered a natural proficiency for computing, but his activities \u2013 which included accessing several secure systems, including the Pentagon and NASA, under the hacker alias \u201cMendax\u201d \u2013 soon put him on the radar of authorities. In 1991, he was charged with 31 counts of cybercrime by Australian authorities but only received a small fine at sentencing after pleading guilty to most of the charges. Following his brush with the law, Assange worked as a computer security consultant, traveled and briefly studied physics at the University of Melbourne before withdrawing from the course. His vision when starting WikiLeaks in 2006 was that it would be a kind of online repository, which would publish anonymously submitted documents, video and other sensitive materials after vetting them. It ran for several years, uploading material ranging from the US military\u2019s operating manual for its detention camp in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to internal documents from the Church of Scientology and some of 2008 Republican vice-presidential nominee Sarah Palin\u2019s stolen emails. But it was catapulted to global attention in 2010 with a video that later became known as \u201cCollateral Murder.\u201d Back then, journalist Atika Shubert caught wind of footage circulating which claimed to show a deadly 2007 US helicopter attack in Iraq. Then a reporter for CNN in London, Shubert tracked down the individual in possession of the footage. On first impressions, Assange was \u201cvague\u201d and \u201celusive,\u201d Shubert recalled. With the benefit of hindsight, she now believes his behavior was the result of \u201csitting on this cache of documents from Chelsea Manning and trying to figure out how to publish it.\u201d He showed up unannounced at CNN\u2019s London office soon after, a USB stick with thousands of classified documents in the palm of his hand. \u201cThat was my first introduction to the world of data dumps and what exactly WikiLeaks was doing - the scale of it - which I had never heard of before,\u201d Shubert said. WikiLeaks ultimately released the video from the US helicopter attack in Iraq, sparking condemnation from human rights activists and earning rebuke from US defense officials. By the year\u2019s end, the organization had gone on to publish nearly half a million classified documents relating to the US wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Under a global spotlight As WikiLeaks continued its disclosures, Assange found himself the latest cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre \u2013 his every movement intensely scrutinized. And with each headline, his infamy grew among those who did not share his vision. Fidel Narvaez, former consul of the Ecuadorian embassy in London, met Assange in 2011, after WikiLeaks released another huge archive \u2013 this time of secret US diplomatic cables. The pair became close friends through the years. \u201cAssange can be stubborn, sometimes he can clash with other people, but once you know him \u2026 he is extremely respectful and warm. He has a great sense of humor,\u201d Narvaez told CNN. \u201cHis one mission in life is publishing, which is what he has done with WikiLeaks.\u201d Assange\u2019s story, as the \u201cteen hacker who became insurgent in information war\u201d as the Guardian put it in 2011, sounded like the plot of a Hollywood blockbuster. Soon his tale was immortalized in documentaries and films, perhaps most notably in 2013\u2019s \u201cThe Fifth Estate,\u201d which Assange labeled a \u201cgeriatric snoozefest\u201d that used what he considered flawed source material. For journalist and author James Ball, who briefly worked at WikiLeaks and was based for a time at Ellingham Hall, a remote manor house north of London where Assange holed up before seeking refuge in Ecuador\u2019s embassy, the infancy of WikiLeaks was an \u201cexhilarating\u201d time. \u201cYou were working on the kind of material that we (had) really never seen before. Leaks have become a bit more common since, but the idea that you could peruse through these huge sets of records that showed what happened in conflicts or what actually happened in closed rooms, was sort of completely new,\u201d Ball told CNN. WikiLeaks became a household name thanks to its frequent data dumps, but some were starting to question the founder\u2019s behavior. For many, his polarizing personality became an issue. Ball added: \u201cHe sort of liked the attention. \u2026 He liked the fuss that (the disclosures) caused but he was oddly incurious actually about the documents.\u201d Others offer alternative explanations for Assange\u2019s eccentricities. Narvaez said the Assange he knew was \u201chyperactive and workaholic\u201d and pointed to his diagnosed autism spectrum disorder as an element of his personality. Shifting attitudes Such questions aside, WikiLeaks essentially ground to a halt when Assange was accused of sexual assault in Sweden in August 2010. The organization\u2019s focus shifted from offense to defense, despite the transparency campaigner\u2019s vehement denial of the allegations against him. There were mounting calls for Assange to leave WikiLeaks and, when he didn\u2019t, many cut ties with it. Assange labeled it \u201ca smear campaign\u201d orchestrated to pave the way for his further extradition to the US and refused to go to Sweden for questioning. In June 2012, while out on bail from UK officials over the Swedish probe, he opted for a nuclear option and knocked on the door at 3 Hans Crescent, where he requested political asylum from Ecuador. Outside the confines of his diplomatic shelter, the world questioned whether Assange was trying to circumvent justice. Over time, his relationship with his host soured along with the arrival of a new president in Ecuador in 2017. Assange was \u201can inherited problem\u201d for Lenin Moreno, who was facing pressure from the US to expel him from the diplomatic bolthole. \u201cIt was obvious that former President Moreno was going to give in to external and internal pressure,\u201d Narvaez said. Narvaez, seen as too close to the unwanted houseguest, was asked to leave in July 2018 amid a shake-up of the diplomatic mission\u2019s staff. \u201cI left him isolated, and I was the last person he trusted,\u201d Narvaez said. Nine months later, in April 2019, Assange was pulled kicking and screaming from the building by London\u2019s Metropolitan Police on an extradition warrant from the US Justice Department. Legal limbo Once in British custody, Assange had lived, mostly isolated, in a three-by-two-meter cell at Belmarsh prison in southeast London. The prison has the capacity to hold over 900 inmates and is known for once housing infamous terror suspects such as\u00a0Abu Hamza al-Masri\u00a0within its high-security unit. The US accused Assange of endangering lives by publishing secret military documents in 2010 and 2011. He was wanted on 18 criminal charges relating to his organization\u2019s dissemination of classified material and diplomatic cables and faced up to 175 years in prison conditions much harsher than here in the UK. Fighting his corner since he entered Belmarsh: his wife, Stella Assange. The couple married in March 2022, while he was in prison. Stella, the mother of Assange\u2019s two young sons, called her husband a \u201cpolitical prisoner\u201d outside court in March and has repeatedly voiced her fear that, if extradited, he could take his own life. \u201cI\u2019m very concerned about how he\u2019s doing. Physically, he\u2019s aged prematurely,\u201d she previously told CNN. \u201cHe\u2019s on medication. As you know, in October 2021, he had a mini-stroke and he has all sorts of health problems.\u201d She had labeled the US\u2019 latest guarantees that Assange could lean on First Amendment protections at trial\u00a0\u201cblatant weasel words\u201d in a statement on April 16. \u201cThe diplomatic note does nothing to relieve our family\u2019s extreme distress about his future \u2013 his grim expectation of spending the rest of his life in isolation in US prison for publishing award-winning journalism,\u201d she said. Nick Vamos, head of business crime at Peters & Peters law firm and a former head of extradition at the UK\u2019s Crown Prosecution Service, told CNN that on the other side of the coin, some might suggest that \u201cyou should allow the judicial system to follow through to its conclusion\u201d without being influenced by protests from supporters. Assange\u2019s team had argued his potential extradition was for political reasons and that a handover to the US violated the European Convention on Human Rights. It was a claim supported by independent experts. The UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, Alice Jill Edwards, in February called on the British government to halt a possible extradition and reiterated her concerns about Assange\u2019s fitness and \u201cthe potential for him to receive a wholly disproportionate sentence in the United States.\u201d Marking Assange\u2019s five years at Belmarsh, Amnesty International\u2019s Secretary General Agn\u00e8s Callamard had warned that Assange, if extradited, would \u201cbe at risk of serious abuse, including prolonged solitary confinement, which would violate the prohibition on torture or other ill-treatment.\u201d She added that US assurances over his treatment could not be relied upon as they are \u201criddled with loopholes.\u201d Far-reaching repercussions Beyond the personal costs for Assange, many had expressed concern about the broader implications for press freedom around the world if he had been sent to the US. Five international media organizations that collaborated with Assange previously called the US government to end its prosecution of him for publishing classified material. In a 2022 letter, representatives for The New York Times, the Guardian, Le Monde, El Pa\u00eds and Der Spiegel argued publishing is not a crime. \u201cObtaining and disclosing sensitive information when necessary in the public interest is a core part of the daily work of journalists. If that work is criminalised, our public discourse and our democracies are made significantly weaker,\u201d the letter stated. Jameel Jaffer, executive director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, said the plea deal averted \u201cthe worst-case scenario for press freedom, but this deal contemplates that Assange will have served five years in prison for activities that journalists engage in every day. He continued, \u201cIt will cast a long shadow over the most important kinds of journalism, not just in this country but around the world.\u201d Likewise, former Guardian editor and collaborator Alan Rusbridger wrote on X that while it was \u201cgood news that Assange is apparently free,\u201d he expressed concern at the repercussions of his years-long legal battle. \u201cHis treatment was a warning to journalists and whistleblowers to keep quiet in future,\u201d he added. And I suspect it will have worked.\u201d This story has been updated with latest developments following Assange\u2019s US plea deal.

I saw very considerable achievements in the fighting being carried in Rafah. We are advancing to the end of the stage of eliminating the Hamas terrorist army; we will continue striking its remnants,\u201d Netanyahu said, speaking to a group of mainly Israeli and international military officials studying at the National Security College. He again vowed that Israel would achieve its goals in its war against Hamas: returning hostages from Gaza, eliminating Hamas\u2019 military and governing capabilities, ensuring that Gaza will not constitute a threat against Israel and also returning displaced Israeli residents securely to their homes in both the south and the north. Before launching a military operation in Rafah in May, Israeli leaders had maintained that the southern Gaza city was the last stronghold of Hamas.

Argamani, one of four hostages rescued by the Israeli military in a special operation in Gaza this month, spoke out in footage played at a protest in Tel Aviv on Saturday in which she also called for the return of the remaining 120 captives, who include her partner Avinatan Or. \u201cAlthough I\u2019m home now, we can\u2019t forget about the hostages who are still in Hamas captivity, and we must do everything possible to bring them back home,\u201d Argamani said in the two-minute clip, which was played during a rally led by the Hostages and Missing Families Forum. Argamani said she felt privileged to be back with her family, especially her mother, who has late-stage cancer. \u201cAs an only child to my parents \u2013 and a daughter to a mother with a terminal illness \u2013 my biggest worry in captivity was for my parents.\u201d Argamani and her partner Or were abducted by Hamas at the Nova music festival on Oct. 7. Widely circulated footage of her kidnapping showed her being hoisted onto the back of a motorcycle and driven away as Or was apprehended and made to walk with his hands behind his back. Argamani was in captivity for eight months before she and three other hostages \u2013 Almog Meir Jan, Andrey Kozlov, and Shlomi Ziv \u2013 were rescued in an Israeli operation that Gazan authorities said killed more than 200 people. A senior Hamas official has told CNN that \u201cno one has an idea\u201d how many hostages are still alive. \u201cI want to take this opportunity to remind everyone that there are still 120 hostages in Hamas captivity. Among them is Avinatan Or, my partner, from whom I was separated at the moment of abduction,\u201d Argamani said in the video message. Her\u00a0statement stopped short of calling on the government to strike a ceasefire deal with Hamas that could lead to the release of more hostages. The video was played before a crowd of protesters, who have been holding large rallies in Tel Aviv for months.\u00a0Such rallies often attract thousands of people, with many calling for the return of all hostages, some demanding a hostage deal, and others pushing for the ouster of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government.

The crash happened when the first stage of the Tianlong-3 rocket detached from its launch pad during a test, due to structural failure. It landed in a hilly area of the city of Gongyi in central China. \u201cDue to the structural failure of the connection between the rocket body and the test platform, the first-stage rocket was separated from the launch pad,\u201d Space Pioneer, also known as Beijing Tianbing Technology, said. \u201cAfter liftoff, the onboard computer was automatically shut down, and the rocket fell into the deep mountains 1.5 kilometers [0.9 miles] southwest of the test platform. The rocket body fell into the mountain and disintegrated.\u201d There were no injuries as a result of the crash, the company said, as people in the area were evacuated in advance of the rocket test. Space Pioneer, a leading company in the commercial rocket sphere, specializes in liquid-propellant rockets. In April 2023, it successfully launched its Tianlong-2 rocket, making the company China\u2019s first commercial launch operator to send a liquid carrier rocket into space and successfully enter orbit, according to state media. Tianlong-3, the rocket that crashed on Sunday, is a large liquid carrier rocket. It was made to help construct China\u2019s satellite internet network.

{"id": "2024_06_30_asia_us-military-rebuilds-runway-peleliu-palau-intl-hnk-ml", "text": "A US Marine Corps aircraft has landed on a rebuilt runway on a World War II-era Japanese airfield on the Pacific island of Peleliu, site of one of the Marines\u2019 bloodiest battles of the war and now a possible US basing option in a strategy to counter China. The KC-130 Hercules transport aircraft touched down on the 6,000-foot runway on June 22 in what a Marine Corps press release called \u201ca significant and triumphant return to this iconic World War II site.\u201d Marine engineers had been working on rebuilding the runway for months, clearing brush, removing trees and ensuring no unexploded ordnance remained from the World War II battle on the island, which is part of the island country of Palau. More than 1,500 US troops and nearly 11,000 Japanese were killed on Peleliu between August and November of 1944, according to the US Naval History and Heritage Command, which noted that some Japanese troops hid in the island\u2019s jungle and weren\u2019t found until two years after World War II ended. One US unit, the 1st Marine Regiment, suffered 70% casualties in six days of fighting on the island. The Marines named the rebuilt landing strip the \u201cSledge\u201d runway in honor of a veteran of the Peleliu battle, Pfc. Eugene Sledge, a mortarman on the island who wrote about it in a memoir \u201cWith the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa,\u201d and whose memories were portrayed in the HBO miniseries \u201cThe Pacific.\u201d Sledge described Peleliu as \u201can alien, unearthly, surrealistic nightmare like the surface of another planet.\u201d Now the runway \u201cbridges the past and the future, honoring WWII sacrifices while enhancing regional security and cooperation,\u201d the Marine Corps release said. That regional security has been largely focused on China in recent years, which the Pentagon identifies as its \u201cpacing threat.\u201d Part of mitigating the threat has been building facilities where the US could disperse assets like aircraft in the event of hostilities, including in the so-called Second Island Chain, locations far enough away from the Chinese mainland that Beijing would have difficulty striking targets there. The First Island Chain, in such places as Okinawa in Japan, and US bases in the Philippines, \u201cis neither a survivable nor viable operating location due to Chinese military capabilities in long-range bombers, cruise missiles, and theater ballistic missiles,\u201d US Air Force Lt. Col. Grant Georgulis wrote in a 2022 commentary posted on the US Defense Department website. \u201cThus, the United States should prioritize Midway Island, the Marianas, Palau, and the Marshall Islands to complement an already fortified Guam,\u201d Georgulis wrote. China has been deeply critical of Washington\u2019s alliance-building efforts in the Pacific, viewing them as an attempt to halt Beijing\u2019s rise as a military and economic superpower. Beijing has long felt boxed in by the US presence in the First and Second Island Chains and under leader Xi Jinping has become much more assertive in regional waters and confrontational with neighbors such as Japan and the Philippines. It has also sought to boost its own diplomatic and security ties across the Pacific region. \u201cIn a bid to protect its hegemony, the United States is forming blocs globally to target specific countries, provoke confrontation and destabilize the world,\u201d China\u2019s state-run Xinhua news agency wrote in a recent editorial. \u201cIt claims to protect its allies under mutual defense treaties, but in reality, the treaties serve as a tool to subordinate them to the superpower and push them to the forefront of conflicts.\u201d Reviving airfield used by US atomic bombers Meanwhile, on Yap island in the Federated States of Micronesia, midway between Guam and Palau, the US Air Force in its 2025 budget requested $400 million to extend the runway at the island\u2019s international airport \u2013 also a former Japanese military airfield \u2013 so it can be used by US military aircraft. The US is already performing work on other locations in the Second Island Chain, including reviving North Field on Tinian island in the Northern Marianas, from where the US bombers that dropped the atomic bombs departed in August 1945. \u201cThe United States must focus like a laser on the need for air superiority in the Pacific region. The United States must recapitalize islands gained during World War II to form a Second Island Chain of strategic expeditionary points,\u201d Georgulis wrote. For Washington, establishing strong ties to Pacific island states is also seen as a way to keep China from gaining footholds in the region. The Biden administration has signed a bilateral defense agreement with Papua New Guinea and reopened an embassy in the Solomon Islands since the beginning of 2023. Palau is a remote archipelago of coral and volcanic islands in the western Pacific and home to about 20,000 people. Since 1994, Palau has been covered by a compact of free association with the United States, making Washington responsible for its defense needs and allowing Palauans to serve in the US military. Palau last year signed a bilateral law enforcement agreement with Washington that will let the US Coast Guard enforce its laws in its exclusive economic zone without a Palau officer present. US Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro visited Palau\u2019s capital of Koror in March as part of a Pacific trip that included stops at two key US allies, Japan and South Korea, during which he said Washington\u2019s partnership with the island state \u201cdirectly supports a free and open Indo-Pacific.\u201d \u201cI can assure you that the United States remains committed to Palau\u2019s national security,\u201d Del Toro said during a trip that also included a visit to the Peleliu island runway work. Palau President Surangel Whipps Jr. has been critical of China\u2019s increasingly assertive moves in the region, including toward Taiwan. Palau is one of the few remaining countries to diplomatically\u00a0recognize Taiwan over Beijing. Along with the runway, US Marines are helping make improvements to the Peleliu Civic Center Museum, to house artifacts from the World War II battle. At an event last month marking the landing of the Marine aircraft on Peleliu, island Gov. Emais Roberts thanked the US Defense Department for its efforts there. \u201cOur small island community has benefitted immensely with the US Marine presence. We value the great partnership, and we feel safe and protected with the support of the greatest country in this world.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/30/asia/us-military-rebuilds-runway-peleliu-palau-intl-hnk-ml/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "world"}}

The plane has the capacity to hold up to 339 passengers, according to Air Europa\u2019s website. \u201cFrom one moment to the next, the plane destabilized and went into a dive. The people who didn\u2019t have seat belts went up in the air and hit the ceiling, and they got hurt \u2013 those who had seat belts on, not so much,\u201d one of the passengers, Maximiliano, told Reuters. Another passenger, Stevan, told the news agency: \u201cThere are passengers with fractures and injuries to their arms, faces, and legs. There are about 30 people injured. It was a pretty horrible feeling; we thought we were going to die there, but thank God it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d The Spanish airline said that another plane was set to depart later on Monday from Madrid and pick up the passengers stranded in Brazil to continue their journey to Uruguay. Air Europa added that anyone who is in need of healthcare is being treated in Brazil\u2019s Natal International Airport. The news comes as the latest development in a string of bad publicity for the airplane manufacturer Boeing. While there\u2019s no evidence so far that the injuries on the Air Europa flight had anything to do with a safety malfunction, Boeing has recently faced a series of whistleblowers alleging safety issues at the company. Just last week,\u00a0a whistleblower came forward alleging parts\u00a0of Boeing\u2019s 787 Dreamliner planes were built in an unsafe manner \u2013 potentially leading to \u201cdevastating consequences.\u201d A previous whistleblower, Sam Salehpour, a Boeing engineer, said he found and reported similar gaps in 787 and 777 aircraft. For nearly two years starting in 2021, the FAA and Boeing\u00a0halted deliveries of the new Dreamliners\u00a0while it looked into the gaps. Boeing said it made changes in its manufacturing process and deliveries ultimately resumed. More than a dozen whistleblowers have come forward against Boeing in recent years, and the number has grown substantially since a\u00a0door plug blew off a 737 Max plane\u00a0in January just after takeoff, leaving a gaping hole in the side the plane. The FAA has opened multiple investigations into Boeing and the US Department of Justice said it\u00a0may file criminal charges\u00a0against the company because of its ongoing quality and safety failures.

Military officials first held meetings in May to plot the coup attempt on Wednesday, which involved mobilizing armed forces toward the capital\u2019s main square\u00a0and seizing power \u201cby force,\u201d according to\u00a0a report sent to CNN by the Bolivian government. The meetings were led by former army chief Gen. Juan Jose Z\u00fa\u00f1iga and former navy commander Gen. Juan Arnez, with Z\u00fa\u00f1iga\u2019s civilian personal adviser allegedly devising the \u201cstrategy\u201d of the coup, the report claims. All three men are\u00a0among 17 people arrested so far in connection with Wednesday\u2019s events \u2013 most of them members of the military, the report says. Other top officials arrested include military intelligence chief Julio Buitrago. The coup attempt, which was condemned by the Bolivian government and international leaders, comes as the South American country of roughly 12 million people struggles with an economic crisis and political instability that has fueled mass street protests. On Wednesday, military units led by Z\u00fa\u00f1iga \u2013\u00a0who was fired as commander of the Bolivian army just a day earlier \u2013 occupied La Paz\u2019s main Murillo Plaza as armored vehicles rammed the presidential palace door and soldiers tried to break into government offices. Hours later, President Luis Arce \u2013 who had called on the public to \u201corganize and mobilize\u201d in defense of democracy \u2013 could be seen confronting Z\u00fa\u00f1iga in the crowded palace hallway, ordering the general to withdraw his soldiers and stand down. Arce, who has been in power since 2020, later declared victory to crowds in front of the Quemado Palace after\u00a0Z\u00fa\u00f1iga was handcuffed and forced into a police car. Following the coup attempt, Bolivia\u2019s defense minister Edmundo Novillo told a news conference the government had regained \u201ctotal and absolute control\u201d over its military. \u201cWe urge the population that everything goes back to normal,\u201d he said. As he was being arrested Z\u00fa\u00f1iga alleged \u2013 without providing evidence \u2013 that he was acting on Arce\u2019s instructions. Arce denied the former army chief\u2019s allegations on Thursday, telling reporters  the coup attempt had caught him by surprise. Meanwhile, Novillo told CNN that Z\u00fa\u00f1iga was \u201ctrying to drag the president through the mud.\u201d Bolivia, which has seen almost 40 attempted or successful coups since 1946, has been wracked by dwindling foreign currency reserves, particularly the US dollar, and shortages of fuel and other necessities. Tensions have also been rising over plans by leftist former president Evo Morales to challenge one-time Arce ally in next year\u2019s general elections. The investigation into Wednesday\u2019s events will continue until all \u201cparticipants\u201d in the coup are identified, according to the Bolivian government report. It also says the country\u2019s Air Force commander was involved with planning the failed coup, but no one of that description is included in the list of arrests.

Li\u2019s mysterious disappearance and drastic ouster just months into his job fueled intense speculation, coming after the surprise sacking of two top generals of the PLA Rocket Force, an elite unit overseeing the China\u2019s nuclear and ballistic missiles, also without explanation.

In a sign of the scale of the high-level purges, Li\u2019s predecessor, Wei Fenghe, was also expelled from the Communist Party Thursday over alleged corruption, according to CCTV. Both Li and Wei were former members of the Central Military Commission (CMC) \u2013 a powerful body headed by Chinese leader Xi Jinping who ultimately commands the armed forces. Li was placed under the military\u2019s internal investigation over \u201cserious violations of party discipline and law\u201d on August 31 last year, according to CCTV, two days after he was last seen in public at a security forum in Beijing. The investigation by the CMC\u2019s Commission for Discipline Inspection found Li had allegedly \u201cseriously violated\u201d political and organization disciplines, resisted investigation, sought \u201cpersonnel benefits\u201d for himself and others, and received \u201chuge sums of money\u201d in bribe as well as bribing others. \u201cAs a senior party and military leader, Li Shangfu betrayed his original mission and lost the principles of party spirit,\u201d the CCTV report said, adding that his actions \u201cbetrayed the trust and responsibility placed in him\u201d by the top leadership of the party and the military. His actions also \u201cseverely tainted the political and industry environment of the military equipment sector, caused significant damage to the party\u2019s cause, the development of national defense and the military, and the image of senior leadership,\u201d CCTV said. \u201cThe nature of his misconduct is extremely serious, the impact is exceedingly harmful, and the consequences are particularly severe.\u201d Wei, Li\u2019s predecessor as defense minister from 2018 to 2023, was also accused of serious violations of political and organization disciplines, resisting investigation, taking bribes, as well as \u201ccollapse of faith and loss of loyalty,\u201d according to CCTV. Both Li and Wei\u2019s cases have been handed to the military procuratorate for prosecution, CCTV said, adding that the two generals had been stripped of their military ranks. The allegations laid out in the CCTV reports appear to point to corruption in the procurement and development of China\u2019s military equipment, with a likely focus on the Rocket Force \u2013 which has been a key element in Xi\u2019s efforts to \u201cmodernize\u201d the PLA and transform it into a \u201cworld class\u201d fighting force. Before becoming Defense Minister, Li headed the PLA\u2019s Equipment Development Department for five years, while Wei was the inaugural commander of the Rocket Force when it was revamped at the end of 2015. Since last summer, more than a dozen high-level military officers and aerospace executives in the military-industrial complex have been stripped of their public roles. Xi has made rooting out corruption and disloyalty a hallmark of his rule since coming to power in 2012, and the purges suggest that campaign is far from over within the military.

{"id": "2024_06_30_europe_russia-hybrid-war-nato", "text": "When someone tried \u2013 and failed \u2013 to burn down a bus garage in Prague earlier this month, the unsuccessful arson attack didn\u2019t draw much attention. Until, that is, Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala revealed it was \u201cvery likely\u201d that Moscow was behind it. The accusation prompted alarm among security officials and governments because several similar incidents have occurred across Europe in recent months. The Museum of Occupation in Riga was targeted in an arson attack in February. A London warehouse burnt down in March and a shopping center in Warsaw went up in flames in May. Police in Germany arrested several people suspected of planning explosions and arson attacks in April, and French authorities launched an anti-terror investigation after detaining a suspected bomb-maker who was injured in a botched explosion earlier this month. Multiple hacking attacks and spying incidents have been reported in different European countries. As the same time, the European Union has accused Russia and Belarus of weaponizing migration by pushing asylum seekers from third countries to its borders. There have also been several suspicious attacks against individuals: a Russian defector was found shot dead in Spain and an opposition figure exiled in Lithuania was brutally attacked with a hammer. The seemingly random attacks have one thing in common: according to local officials, they are all linked to Russia. And while they might look minor in isolation, taken together these incidents amount to what security experts say is Russia\u2019s hybrid war on the West. \u201cWe are threatened by something which is not a full-fledged military attack, which are these hybrid threats \u2026 everything from meddling in our political processes, (undermining) the trust in our political institutions, disinformation, cyber-attacks (\u2026) and sabotage actions against critical infrastructure,\u201d NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said during an event in Canada last week. Rod Thornton, a senior lecturer in defense studies at King\u2019s College London, said there\u2019s been a pattern of attacks linked back to Russia. \u201cThere has definitely been an increase over the last few months in these particular types of operations. It is something that the Russians are ramping up,\u201d Thornton said. Moscow has not claimed responsibility for any of the attacks and has not responded to CNN\u2019s request for comment, but Russian President Vladimir Putin has made it clear he sees the war in Ukraine as part of a broader conflict with NATO and that his regime views the government in Kyiv as a mere proxy of the West. And with every increase of Western aid to Ukraine \u2013 whether through new weapons deliveries, or the imposition of new sanctions on Russia \u2013 the Kremlin has stepped up its saber-rattling. Thornton said Russia was resorting to a campaign of sabotage as an alternative to a full-on war with NATO, which would be disastrous for Russia. \u201cIt\u2019s long been a part of Russian military doctrine to try and avoid trying to face NATO on a battlefield, because they know they would lose to NATO forces,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat they are doing is undertaking activities which are below the threshold of armed conflict, so they are not inciting an Article 5 response from NATO,\u201d he added. Article 5 is the cornerstone principle that an attack on one member of NATO is an attack on all members. It\u2019s only been invoked once \u2013 after the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the United States by al Qaeda. Thornton said that by deliberately keeping the attacks below the threshold of armed conflict, Russia is hoping to sow more divisions within NATO because there is no clear blueprint on how to act. \u201cNATO only works when all member states of NATO act in unison. It\u2019s no good if the US, the UK, maybe France say, let\u2019s do this against Russia, and if the other countries say, well, you know, we don\u2019t want to do that, we need to wait on this.\u201d Nicole Wolkov, a Russia researcher at the US-based Institute for the Study of War, said Russia\u2019s main goal now is to disrupt the flows of Western military aid to Ukraine. \u201cThese hybrid operations are part of Russia\u2019s war effort to weaken Western resolve to support Ukraine and undermine unity within the West,\u201d she said, warning that in the long term, Russia might be gearing up for a more direct confrontation. \u201cRussia is, and has been since before the war, conducting these hybrid operations against NATO, the West, the EU, in tandem with its attempts to improve its conventional military abilities for a potential future conflict with NATO,\u201d she told CNN. Years in the making Russia-watchers say Moscow has been beefing up its hybrid war units for years. The most obvious sign of this, they say, was the promotion of a notorious spy commander, Andrei Averyanov, into the top ranks of the GRU in 2020. Averyanov allegedly oversaw the 2018 Novichok nerve agent poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury in England, and the 2014 blast in an ammunition depot in the Czech Republic that killed two people. Now the deputy head of the GRU, he is wanted in the Czech Republic over his role in the blast in the town of Vrbetice. Russia has repeatedly denied its involvement in both events. \u201cHe was previously the head of 29155 unit, which is known for its participation in the Salisbury attack, they attempted to organize that coup d\u2019etat in Montenegro, they had operations to destabilize Moldova and Macedonia,\u201d said Oleksandr Danylyuk, an associate fellow at Royal United Services Institute, a UK defense and security think tank, and a former Ukrainian defense and foreign intelligence official. \u201cHis promotion and the creation of a new Special Activity Division that has new powers to recruit their own assets \u2026 it\u2019s a very strong indicator that Russia is trying to expand its capabilities,\u201d he added. Czech Police said that the suspected arsonist in the recent bus station incident was a 26-year-old foreigner who had only arrived in the Czech Republic five days earlier. Fiala, the prime minister, alleged the man was paid for his actions. The amateurish nature of the Prague attack \u2013 the perpetrator did not manage to cause any significant damage and was caught \u2013 fits the pattern. \u201cAt the moment, most of these people are just proxies that are paid by the GRU, they aren\u2019t trained to do these types of operations, they might be seen as a testing mechanism conducted by the Russians to see where the weaknesses of Western critical national infrastructure are,\u201d said Danylyuk. Five people have been charged in connection with the arson attack in London \u2013 four of them were in their early 20s and at least one was accused of being paid for the attack. The office of the German Federal Public Prosecutor\u00a0said the people who were arrested on suspicion of planning arson attacks and explosions on behalf of Russia were \u201cin contact\u201d with Russian security officials, rather than being spies themselves. In Poland, a man arrested for spying and planning Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky\u2019s assassination was also a local citizen. Danylyuk said the Russian security apparatus doesn\u2019t shy away from using criminals to do its dirty work, tapping into its links with international organized crime. \u201cWhat is actually super dangerous and disturbing is that they are using these networks, plus a lot of potentially violent organizations, radical groups, far-right groups, far-left groups,\u201d he said. Cybercrime and disinformation Most of the attacks uncovered so far have been relatively minor, suggesting that Russia\u2019s goal isn\u2019t as much about inflicting the biggest possible damage as scaring the local population. \u201cThe aim is to break the will of the citizens and to break the support for Ukraine. If you were living peacefully in your country and suddenly you have a series of terrorist attacks, and this is all attributed to your country supporting Ukraine, that puts pressure on your support for Ukraine,\u201d said Olga Lautman, a security researcher who specializes in the intersection of organized crime and intelligence operations in Russia. Many of the attacks are accompanied by a disinformation campaign designed to deflect the blame from Russia, researchers say. That\u2019s very much what happened in the aftermath of the failed arson attack in Prague, according to research from Czech Elves, a group of volunteer activists who monitor, analyze and fight disinformation campaigns that appear on the Czech internet. The group said that disinformation campaigns it monitored tried to trivialize the attacks and discredit the Czech government. One narrative sought to portray the accusation by Fiala that Russia was behind the arson as an attempt to distract from the government\u2019s poor showing in the European Parliament election. Others mocked the facts, saying the attack affected \u201conly\u201d a few buses. \u201cYou have these terrorist attacks and at the same time disinformation operations are blaming the politicians in charge, saying this is why Germany or Poland or the United States should not be involved in supporting Ukraine, because this is not their war,\u201d Lautman said. The disinformation campaigns appear to go hand-in-hand with cyberattacks. Multiple countries across Europe have suffered major hacks in recent months. Authorities in Finland and Estonia said the GPS signal was being jammed regularly, causing disruptions to flights. Multiple French government departments suffered what the French described as \u201ca massive cyberattack\u201d in February and, earlier this month, a blood-testing laboratory servicing multiple hospitals in England became a target of a ransomware attack. Yet Thornton said these incidents are likely just the beginning. \u201cWhat Russian cyber operatives are doing now is testing weaknesses within cyber security systems, planting malware, finding out where and how to attack without doing it now,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ll wait for the big day when they need them.\u201d Underestimating Russia NATO has for months been warning about Russia\u2019s unconventional attacks on the West, saying Moscow is using espionage, cyber-attacks, electoral interference, disinformation and sabotage trying to destabilize the bloc and weaken its resolve to help Ukraine. But until recently, European leaders were reluctant to point a finger directly at the Kremlin. According to Lautman, Moscow has become emboldened over recent years, because it has rarely been held accountable. The US and some European countries imposed limited sanctions on Russia over its actions in Ukraine in 2014. However, it wasn\u2019t until Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 that the West really flexed its sanctions muscle against Russia. Lautman, who is a non-resident senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis, said the complacency towards Russian attacks goes back to at least the 2006 killing of Alexander Litvinenko in London. The former Russian agent turned Kremlin critic was poisoned by a rare radioactive isotope, polonium-210, in what the European Court of Human Rights said was a state-sponsored attack by Russia. The Kremlin has always denied the accusation. \u201cThey got away with it. Everyone knew it was Russia. I mean, the [alleged]\u00a0assassin Andrei Lugovoi was promoted and put into the Duma,\u201d Lautman said, adding: \u201cAnd with Skripal, I will never forget (Prime Minister) Theresa May giving Russia an ultimatum to provide answers. And they delivered another dead body within 48 hours \u2013 Nikolai Glushkov.\u201d Glushkov, a Putin critic, was living in the UK after being granted political asylum. He was found dead in his home in London a week after the Salisbury poisoning. A spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police told CNN that a post-mortem found that he had been strangled and that a murder investigation led by detectives from the Met\u2019s Counter Terrorism Command continues.\u00a0No arrests have been made and no motive established. Thornton said that NATO was reluctant to blame the Skripal poisoning directly on Putin and the Russian state because of the risk of escalation and pushing Russia into being a \u201ccomplete adversary.\u201d \u201c(They) would kind of said maybe it was a rogue GRU operation, was Putin really behind it? There was an element of \u2018let\u2019s not go too far, because we don\u2019t want to lose Putin completely,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cNow that\u2019s completely off the table,\u201d he added. While many of the more high-profile attacks \u2013 the Litvinenko and Skripal poisonings, for example \u2013 are thought to have been approved or even ordered directly by Putin, the desire to hurt the West cuts through the Russian political establishment, analysts say. The people known as siloviki \u2014 Russia\u2019s most powerful men (they are almost exclusively men) who rose to power through the ranks of the Soviet and Russian security services \u2013 see the relationship between the West and Russia as a zero-sum game. Russia can only be strong if the West and NATO are weak. \u201cRussia has always been antagonistic towards the West,\u201d Thornton said. \u201cIt goes way back to tsarist times, the idea of the West being a threat, that the West wants to do Russia down, to make Russia a smaller state, a weak state \u2026 so whoever you put in power in the Kremlin, there\u2019s still going to be this mindset that the West is in essence the enemy.\u201d Lautman agreed, adding that the current establishment\u2019s hatred towards the West stems partly from the events following the fall of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, when Russia had to be bailed out by the West after its economy collapsed. The idea that Russia\u2019s aggression will end\u00a0with\u00a0the eventual demise of Putin is the West\u2019s \u201cbiggest mistake,\u201d she said, predicting successive leaders\u00a0will\u00a0continue\u00a0to see\u00a0the West as an enemy until the country gives up the idea of Russian imperialism \u2013 which won\u2019t happen easily. \u201cAnd Europe, and the whole international community who wants global stability, they need to understand that Russia is at war with us and that they will continue escalating unless we start acting.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/30/europe/russia-hybrid-war-nato/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_style_fumihiko-maki-architect-dies", "text": "Tokyo (AP) \u2014 Japanese architect Fumihiko Maki, who won the prestigious Pritzker Prize for designs praised as smartly and artfully fusing the East with the West, has died. He was 95. Maki, who taught architecture and urban design at Harvard, died June 6, his office, Maki & Associates, said Wednesday. Japanese media reports attributed the cause of death to old age. The office declined to confirm the reports. The National Museum of Modern Art in Kyoto is considered one of his classic designs, with floating forms of glass, metal and concrete. Its gray exterior appears simple at first glance but sets off patterns of reflected light on rough and polished marble. In the U.S., Maki\u2019s projects included the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco and 4 World Trade Center in New York. He also did the Makuhari Messe exhibition hall in Chiba, Japan, and the Hillside Terrace Complex in Tokyo. Maki in the 1980s designed Tokyo\u2019s Spiral building, whose management mourned his death and thanked him for \u201cthe beautiful slopes and the rich space that envisioned an urban park.\u201d In 2013, Maki\u00a0complained about the then planned spaceship-like design\u00a0of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics stadium, slamming it as too expensive and clashing with its surroundings. He said he had the support 100 other people, including architects, in opposing the size of the proposed design by British-Iraqi architect Zaha Hadid. \u201cThe problems I see with the planned stadium all relate to the issue of scale,\u201d he said.That design was eventually ditched for a more modest-looking design by\u00a0Kengo Kuma\u00a0which used pieces of wood for a natural Japanese look. Born in Tokyo in 1928, Maki was educated at the University of Tokyo, the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Michigan and Harvard University Graduate School of Design. Before opening his own design firm in 1965 in Tokyo, he worked in various offices including Skidmore Owings and Merrill, or SOM, based in Chicago, and Sert, Jackson & Associates in Cambridge, as well as the campus planning office of Washington University in St. Louis. A devoted educator, Maki, in addition to teaching at Washington University, Harvard and the University of Tokyo, lectured around the world. His essays were published in a collection called \u201cNurturing Dreams\u201d by MIT Press in 2008. In it, he explored the Japanese sense of space called \u201coku,\u201d which Maki described as \u201cthe core of this high-density space organized into multiple layers like an onion.\u201d Utilizing oku allowed the Japanese to deliver a feeling of depth even in a cramped area, according to this theory. \u201cIn the formation of urban space, certain stable concepts that have been sifted and committed to memory by the collective unconscious of the community work automatically,\u201d Maki wrote. \u201cOku, a spatial concept peculiar to Japan, is a good example, and I believe an understanding of this way of perceiving space is important in formulating ideas of what future cities should be like.\u201d Maki was the second Japanese to win the Pritzker, hailed as the Nobel Prize of architecture, after Kenzo Tange, his mentor. Maki, along with fellow Tange students\u00a0Arata Isozaki\u00a0and\u00a0Kisho Kurokawa, were the pillars of Japanese modernism. The Pritzker, in selecting Maki, praised him as part of a new wave of architects rebuilding postwar Japan. \u201cHe uses light in a masterful way making it as tangible a part of every design as are the walls and roof. In each building, he searches for a way to make transparency, translucency and opacity exist in total harmony. He uses detail to give his structures rhythm and scale,\u201d Bill Lacy, a member of the international panel of jurors that selected Maki, said at the time. Maki was honored with other awards, such as the Wolf Prize from Israel in 1988 and the Arnold Brunner Prize from the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1999. In 2011, the American Institute of Architects honored Maki with its highest accolade, the AIA Gold Medal. Japanese media reports said a memorial service was planned.

{"id": "2024_06_29_asia_arzo-afghan-girl-suicide-attempt-pakistan-taliban-intl-hnk-dst", "text": "Holding a mirror steady in one hand, Arzo carefully applies pencil to her brows as she gets ready for an English lesson a short walk from her home on the outskirts of\u202fPakistani megacity Karachi. Every step toward the classroom takes her closer to a future she no longer thought possible almost a year ago when she walked downstairs at her family\u2019s home in Afghanistan and tried to take her own life. \u201cOn that day, I felt like everything was over. I was overwhelmed by hopelessness, and that\u2019s why I drank acid, convinced it would end my life,\u201d said Arzo, whom CNN first met last November as she lay in bed, too weak to speak. At the time, she was 15 years old but weighed as much as a 4-year-old, her limbs painfully thin after months of starvation despite her siblings\u2019 best efforts to feed her through a tube inserted in her stomach. Now, after an extraordinary intervention, Arzo is making a remarkable recovery \u2013 but she faces a new threat that could force her family to return to Afghanistan, and a life under Taliban rule that has become so intolerable for women and girls that some would rather die. Pakistan, a place of refuge for millions of Afghans, is carrying out a mass deportation program that has already seen more than 600,000 people cross the border since September 15 \u2013 with the threat that more could follow in July, when another class of visas expires.  What awaits them is a system of gender apartheid \u2013 violations against women and girls so \u201csevere and extensive\u201d that a senior United Nations official says they may amount to crimes against humanity. It was what drove Arzo to try to take her own life. \u201cThe gravity and scale of the crimes cannot be overstated,\u201d Richard Bennett, the UN\u2019s Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Afghanistan, told a Human Rights Council meeting on June 18, as he presented his damning report on the Taliban\u2019s rule. \u201cWe have a collective responsibility to challenge and dismantle this appalling system and to hold those responsible to account,\u201d he said. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid rejected the report as an attempt to \u201ctarnish perceptions\u201d of Afghanistan before a rare meeting this weekend between UN member states and Taliban officials in Doha, Qatar. Despite strong condemnation of the Taliban by most UN member states, the issue of women\u2019s rights will not be on the formal agenda. Instead, talks with Taliban officials will focus on counternarcotics and the private sector. Afghan women and other civil society members weren\u2019t invited to the meeting \u2013 they\u2019ll meet separately with member states, without the Taliban, the next day, according to a UN official. Rights groups are furious the Taliban meeting is going ahead without Afghan women, and say it legitimizes Afghanistan\u2019s leaders and fails to hold them to account for grave injustices. Smuggled across the border Arzo is not her real name. She and her older brother and sister, Ahamad and Mahsa, are using aliases to protect their family members in Afghanistan from reprisals from the Taliban, who have sought to silence critics of their repressive rule. They\u2019re also hiding from Pakistani authorities, who have threatened to arrest and deport undocumented foreigners, making every trip outside their rented room fraught with risk. After Arzo drank the acid in Afghanistan last July, a doctor told her family she\u2019d likely die if treated there, so they smuggled her across the border to Pakistan, where another doctor inserted a feeding tube into her stomach. For a year, the siblings have spent almost every hour inside a rented room in Karachi with three single beds, a ceiling fan and a carpet where they eat, study and read. For most of that time, Arzo has been confined to bed, unable to eat, after the acid created a stricture \u2013 or a blockage \u2013 in her esophagus. Every three hours, including through the night, Ahamad and Mahsa said they fed their little sister fluids \u2013 nutritional milk powder and juice \u2013 through the tube direct to her stomach. But it wasn\u2019t enough, and by November, Arzo weighed just 25 kilograms, or 55 pounds. By then, most of their money was gone, too, on rent and private medical bills. \u201cWe are financially broken here. Whatever we had, we spent it,\u201d Arzo\u2019s brother Ahamad, a 27-year-old journalist under threat from the Taliban due to his occupation, told CNN in November. \u201cI don\u2019t cry in front of her, but I kiss her and cry while she sleeps at night, for her future, for her treatment, so she can survive this sickness,\u201d he said. A lifesaving intervention Within hours of Arzo\u2019s story airing on CNN last December, an email arrived with the offer of help. A non-profit organization volunteered medical care on the condition that its name wouldn\u2019t be published due to potential repercussions in Pakistan for aiding an Afghan who is residing in the country illegally. \u201cShe was 20 to 22kg at the time that we saw her,\u201d said the doctor who treated Arzo, whom CNN has also agreed not to name. \u201cShe had come to us on a wheelchair and was bedridden at that point. She was essentially one influenza, or cold, or other kind of infection away from essentially dying,\u201d he said. Doctors told her siblings to increase her caloric intake threefold, so she\u2019d be strong enough for her first medical procedure \u2013 an endoscopic examination that revealed severe damage to her esophagus, so that it had almost closed, making it impossible to eat. Using X-ray guidance, the doctors passed a wire through a gap the size of a pinhole and inflated a tiny balloon to slowly widen the passage. \u201cOver the course of two months or so, with multiple staged procedures, we were able to open it up to the point where she was able to eat by mouth, which itself was a game changer,\u201d the doctor told CNN. Arzo\u2019s brother Ahamad sent CNN regular WhatsApp messages. \u2018These lives are not worth anything\u2019 During an interview this month, Arzo sat upright on the bed, straightened her head scarf and spoke for the first time about why she tried to take her own life. It was July 2023, and she was sitting on the second floor of her family\u2019s two-story home, in a remote Afghan province, eating what would be her last meal for months. \u201cAs I ate food at home, I glanced at pictures of my classmates and felt a deep sense of longing for them,\u201d she said. Arzo hadn\u2019t seen her classmates since the Taliban banned girls from secondary education after seizing power in August 2021, and rarely messaged them because the internet connection was cut to her family\u2019s village. So, in a moment of grief for the friends and the life that she loved, she walked downstairs to the battery her family used to power their home and drank its contents. Her sister Mahsa found her and forced her fingers down her throat to make her vomit. \u201cWhen I asked her why she had done such a thing, her response was heartbreaking,\u201d said Mahsa. Arzo had told her: \u201cThese lives are not worth anything,\u201d she said. At the time, Arzo was just 15. Mahsa also lost everything with the Taliban takeover. She was 22 and had graduated from high school before the Taliban banned girls from getting an education beyond elementary school. She held ambitions to become a dress designer or to work in a beauty salon, but those career paths were soon shut down. \u201cWhen I went to Kabul, I enrolled in a tailoring program. However, for three months, I lived in constant fear as the Taliban would visit our workshop daily and criticize us for not wearing the hijab. They eventually forced us to shut down the workshop,\u201d she said. The Taliban ordered beauty salons to close in July 2023. Instead of working, Mahsa found herself in Pakistan caring for Arzo, who was in constant pain with no medication to ease her suffering. \u201cWhen she was asleep, it provided a brief respite from the distress, but the moments when she was awake during our meals were particularly challenging for us to endure,\u201d Mahsa said. Arzo\u2019s treatment has allowed them both to think about their future, and for the first time in years, they\u2019ve glimpsed the possibility of a better life. \u201cWhen hope is lacking and life seems directionless, unexpected events can present themselves,\u201d Mahsa said. Arzo is determined to put the past behind her and has urged other girls in Afghanistan not to follow her lead. \u201cMy message to all girls in Afghanistan who can\u2019t continue their education or go to school is to stay strong and don\u2019t lose hope.\u201d No safe haven in Pakistan While the Taliban is in power, Arzo does not want to go back to Afghanistan, but she and her siblings are not wanted in Pakistan. Last October, Islamabad gave around 1 million undocumented Afghan migrants one month to leave the country or face arrest and deportation. More than 600,000 people fled \u2013 most voluntarily, though 89% said they did so for fear of arrest, according to UN data. Of the total, more than 30,000 people were arrested and deported. On the outskirts of Karachi, residents in one Afghan community thought they were safe from the deportation drive. Security officials came to their area late last year and painted red numbers on their homes to show how many people lived there and their visa status. \u201cAt the beginning, the local people were happy over the markings because \u2026 it would certify that only registered Afghan refugees were living in a specific premises,\u201d said lawyer Moniza Kakar, who showed CNN the markings. Some houses were marked with \u201cACC\u201d (Afghan Citizen Card), others with \u201cPOR\u201d (Proof of Registration) \u2013 both forms of identification issued to Afghans long before the Taliban\u2019s return. But then in April, the government added around 800,000 ACC holders to its removal list. And the expiry date for POR cards was set to June 30, putting another 1.35 million people at risk of deportation. Rain had already washed away some of the red paint, then residents tried to scrub it off to avoid encounters with police, said Kakar, managing partner at Abbas and Kakar Law Offices, who helps community members navigate Pakistan\u2019s immigration system. \u201cThey feel fear and uncertainty about what should happen to them,\u201d she said. Pakistan\u2019s policy on \u201cillegal foreigners\u201d is no different to that of other nations, Pakistani Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Mumtaz Zahra Baloch told CNN. \u201cIndividuals who are here illegally have to be dealt with according to Pakistani laws, and that includes fines, imprisonment and deportation,\u201d she said. Baloch told CNN on Friday that the government still hadn\u2019t decided whether to extend POR visas that were set to expire on Sunday, and had earlier said that Pakistan was considering the implications of \u201call the various options.\u201d Many of those at risk of deportation know little of Afghanistan. Amanullah was just a boy when his family sought refuge in Pakistan during the former Soviet Union\u2019s invasion of Afghanistan in the 1980s, an event that ultimately plunged the country into four decades of near constant conflict. Now he\u2019s firmly settled in the Afghan community in Karachi with seven children of his own, and two grandchildren. \u201cWe have nothing left in Afghanistan anymore,\u201d Amanullah told CNN. \u201cMy children have grown up here and know little about their homeland.\u201d A member of the Mughal tribe, Amanullah sells watermelon at a fruit stall, but he said some other residents had closed their businesses for fear of being deported with no notice. Pakistan has sheltered Afghan migrants for decades but now, amidst a surge in militant attacks on its territory, government officials say they present a security risk. The Taliban has denied any involvement, and relations between the two countries are worsening as they trade accusations \u2013 and in some cases retaliatory strikes. \u2018Our room is like a prison\u2019 In March, as Arzo began to regain strength, her brother Ahamad\u2019s messages turned to the threat of deportation and what that could mean for their family. There are ways out of Pakistan for people like Arzo, Ahamad and Mahsa, but they typically involve taking risky journeys across borders, or joining lengthy waiting lists to be relocated to a third country that agrees to receive them. Afghans without visas can\u2019t legally work in Pakistan, and many who fled Afghanistan after the Taliban takeover have already run out of money. Arzo and her siblings survive on handouts from a small number of supporters outside Pakistan, who are trying to raise enough money to sponsor them to move to Canada. But it\u2019s an expensive and time-consuming process, with no guarantee they won\u2019t be arrested and deported while they wait. Arzo realizes how lucky she is to be alive and says she\u2019s willing to go anywhere she can continue her education, to become a doctor like those who saved her life. \u201cI really thank all the doctors from the bottom my heart,\u201d she said. \u201cMy message to my friends is to be patient. One day, the Taliban will leave Afghanistan, and we will be able to pursue our goals.\u201d But until then, women and girls live in a suffocating silence, where the Taliban have issued at least 52 new edicts since last June, tightening their control over the female population, according to the UN report. \u201cIt should shock all of us that that there\u2019s a country on this planet that denies girls access to education beyond sixth grade, that denies women access to most paid employment,\u201d said Heather Barr, associate women\u2019s rights director at Human Rights Watch. \u201cWomen can\u2019t go to a park. They can\u2019t walk in the sunshine; they can\u2019t exercise; they can\u2019t play sport,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know, all of these things that make you feel human.\u201d Barr is scathing of the UN process and says it\u2019s clear that engaging with the Taliban has not worked. \u201cDiplomatic engagement in terms of getting the Taliban to respect women\u2019s rights has been a 100% failure,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s achieved nothing. And so, it\u2019s time now for us to be talking about other strategies.\u201d She said countries could bring a case against the Taliban in the International Court of Justice (ICJ), much like South Africa\u2019s allegations of genocide against Israel over its military actions in Gaza, or Taliban leaders could be charged with gender\u202fpersecution in the International Criminal Court (ICC). \u201cIt (also) means diplomats and countries listening to the Afghan women\u2019s rights defenders, who are calling for the crime of gender apartheid to be recognized under international law,\u201d Barr added. In his report, UN special rapporteur Bennett also backed calls for gender apartheid to be a punishable offense and predicted a dystopic future for women and girls should the world fail to act. \u201cLeft unchecked, the Taliban\u2019s institutionalized system of gender oppression will become more robust, as those resisting it suffer increasing violence, as memories of female role models and notions of female independence fade, and as new generations are raised and radicalized in a society unquestioning of its dehumanization and exploitation of women and girls,\u201d he wrote. Arzo doesn\u2019t want a life like that for herself, her sister, or the women and girls still in Afghanistan. She\u2019s learning English, hopeful that one day soon she\u2019ll be able to leave Pakistan for a safe country. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the future holds, but as long as I am in Pakistan, I will continue my lessons,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m determined to achieve my goals \u2026 Now I am not scared of anything.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/29/asia/arzo-afghan-girl-suicide-attempt-pakistan-taliban-intl-hnk-dst/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_29_middleeast_iran-presidential-election-runoff-inconclusive-first-round-intl", "text": "A reformist candidate won the most votes in the first round of Iran\u2019s presidential election and will face a conservative hardliner in a run-off next week. None of the four candidates secured more than 50% of the vote in Friday\u2019s election, prompting a second round on July 5. The election saw the lowest voter turnout for a presidential election since the Islamic Republic was established in 1979. Reformist lawmaker Masoud Pezeshkian and ultraconservative former nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili, who received the most votes, will face off in the runoff, according to Mohsen Eslami, the spokesperson for the election committee. Pezeshkian led with 42.5% of the votes, followed by Jalili with 38.6%, according to the state news agency IRNA. Out of 60 million eligible voters, 24 million cast their ballots, resulting in a 40% turnout, Eslami said. The results will be reviewed by the Guardian Council, the powerful 12-member body tasked with overseeing elections and legislation,\u00a0before the two candidates start campaigning again. The snap election was held after Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi died in a helicopter crash on May 19 in the country\u2019s remote northwest, along with Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian and other officials. Two conservatives dropped out of the race just a day before the elections to help the hardline candidates consolidate the conservative vote. Pezeshkian was the only reformist candidate after dozens of other contenders were barred from running by the Guardian Council. The Iranian electoral process has been marred by voter apathy of late, causing embarrassment to an establishment that has relied on high voter turnout to bolster its democratic credentials and popular legitimacy. Nationwide discontent was evident in low voter turnout in both parliamentary and presidential elections in recent years. While Iran has boasted exceptionally high voter participation, its last legislative election in March recorded the lowest turnout since in 1979, despite government efforts to rally voters ahead of the ballot. Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei urged Iranians to head to the polls and vote after he cast his ballot in the election on Friday morning. \u201cPeople\u2019s participation is part of the essence of the state and continuation of the existence of the Islamic Republic and its status in the world is tied to people\u2019s participation\u201d, he said. Sina Toossi, an Iran analyst and senior fellow at the Center for International Policy in Washington, DC, said Pezeshkian may have been allowed to run in the elections in an attempt to boost voter turnout. \u201cThis move could be seen as a strategy to create a more dynamic and engaging election process, thereby encouraging greater public participation,\u201d he told CNN. Who is Masoud Pezeshkian? The two candidates set to compete in the next round of elections represent opposite sides of Iran\u2019s political spectrum, and\u00a0both have run for presidential elections unsuccessfully in the past. A health minister under reformist president Mohammad Khatami, Pezeshkian is a trained heart surgeon and lawmaker. He gained prominence for his stance against the crackdown on the 2009 pro-democracy protests and violence perpetrated by the morality police in 2022 following the death of a young woman in police custody after she was detained for not adhering to the Islamic Republic\u2019s strict dress code for women. During the 2022 protests, Pezeshkian said in an interview with Iran\u2019s IRINN TV: \u201cIt is our fault. We want to implement religious faith through the use of force. This is scientifically impossible.\u201d After losing his wife and one of his children in a 1994 car crash, he devoted much of his time to politics. Pezeshkian ran for president in the 2013 and 2021 elections, but failed to make headway. The 69-year-old hails from an ethnically mixed family \u2013 his father is Azeri and his mother is Kurdish. Persian isn\u2019t his mother tongue. That has burnished his image for Iran\u2019s minorities but left him open to xenophobic attacks from some opponents. A more moderate face in the presidency could make it easier for Western states to have conversations with Iran, particularly on the nuclear issue, regional issues and trade, Vali Nasr, a Middle East academic and former adviser to the US State Department, told CNN. Ahead of Friday\u2019s vote, however, Khamenei condemned those seeking improved relations with the West. Pezeshkian has publicly stated that he would defer to Khamenei on matters of foreign policy. Who is Saeed Jalili? Jalili is an ultraconservative hawk known for his uncompromising dealings with the West. He is a longtime top security adviser to Khamenei and a former soldier with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) during the decade-long Iran-Iraq war. As lead negotiator of the landmark 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and world powers, he spearheaded Tehran\u2019s efforts to win sanctions relief in exchange for controls on its nuclear program. He emerged as a hard-headed opponent, often lecturing US officials on Iran\u2019s rights during negotiations in Geneva. Iranian media outlets describe him as \u201ca firm and meticulous negotiator who did not make concessions\u201d during nuclear negotiations, believing Iran\u2019s economic development should not depend on \u201cforeign will,\u201d lines echoed by the Supreme Leader ahead of the Friday vote. Jalili unsuccessfully ran for the 2013 presidential election. He ran again in 2021, but withdrew in favor of Raisi, who eventually won. Nasr, the Middle East academic, says that with Friday\u2019s election, the clerical establishment in Iran may have been rethinking what the last presidential election produced. Under Raisi, he says, \u201cthe entire system became uniformly hardline, conservative.\u201d Arash Azizi, an Iranian writer and fellow at the Center for Middle East and Global Order (CMEG), said that \u201ca victory by the fundamentalist Jalili\u201d would complicate efforts to restart negotiations with the West. Escalating tensions The elections came at a delicate time for the Islamic Republic. The country is embroiled in escalating tensions with Israel and its Western allies, triggered by the war in Gaza and the advancement of Iran\u2019s nuclear program. The vote also takes place just two months after Iran and Israel exchanged fire for the first time as the Gaza conflict widened. Israel is now preparing for a potential second front with Hezbollah, Iran\u2019s primary regional proxy, in Lebanon. Azizi said Iran\u2019s shadow war with Israel \u201cwill go on regardless of who wins\u201d as the most important decisions in that regard are taken by Khamenei and security bodies, not the president. The country\u2019s Supreme Leader is the final arbiter for most decisions in Iran, but the elected president will be the face of the Islamic Republic abroad. Iran\u2019s fight with the US has left the economy in tatters, crippled by years of American sanctions, a weakening local currency and high inflation.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/29/middleeast/iran-presidential-election-runoff-inconclusive-first-round-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_tech_uae-ai-minister-omar-al-olama-hnk-spc-intl", "text": "The world\u2019s first minister dedicated to developing artificial intelligence (AI) strategy is already becoming embroiled in a global power struggle for tech supremacy. In April, Microsoft (MSFT) announced a $1.5 billion investment in G42, an AI group based in Abu Dhabi, capital of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and chaired by an influential member of the ruling royal family. The deal, which analysts say was motivated by the Biden administration\u2019s desire to limit Beijing\u2019s influence in the region as the US battles to maintain its lead over China in the AI race, firmly pulled the firm into the orbit of the United States. \u201cI think the UAE and the US really see eye to eye with regards to how these technologies are pushed forward,\u201d UAE AI Minister Omar Al Olama, who was appointed in 2017, told CNN in a recent video interview. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to see more alignment there.\u201d G42, a holding firm, is comprised of seven companies that work across data centers, energy, healthcare, surveillance and biotechnology. Its controlling shareholder is Tahnoun bin Zayed Al Nahyan, who also serves as the UAE national security adviser. The UAE is one of the world\u2019s largest producers of fossil fuels, and Abu Dhabi sees its AI push as crucial for diversifying away from oil. AI could contribute $96 billion to the UAE economy by 2030, equivalent to nearly 14% of its gross domestic product, according to a report by PwC Middle East. \u201cWe want to ensure that we are at the frontier of the technology, and that\u2019s why we work with partners around the frontier,\u201d said Olama, \u201cand play by the rules that are set by the market leaders.\u201d Olama, whose ministerial remit includes digital economy and remote work applications, wants to make the UAE a global leader in artificial intelligence by 2031. The UAE has laid out a national strategy to get there. Its objectives include deploying AI in priority sectors such as energy and logistics, developing an ecosystem and attracting talent. The country is putting public officials through AI training, and Dubai is aiming to teach a million citizens effective prompt engineering, instructing AI models to produce high-quality output. As of September, the Gulf country had 120,000 people working on AI or related industries, up from 30,000 two years earlier, Al Olama has said. Choosing sides Sometimes, the country has had to prioritize its relationship with the US over Washington\u2019s rivals. A US Congressional committee called on the Commerce Department in January to investigate G42\u2019s links to Chinese military companies and intelligence services (G42 denied any such connections), and the Microsoft investment required G42 to cut ties with Chinese hardware suppliers, reportedly including Huawei, in favor of US companies. \u201cThe US does not shy away from saying that \u2018on this technology specifically you need to choose sides,\u2019\u201d said Olama. The UAE has historically performed a balancing act with its foreign policy. It cooperates with the US on a range of issues, including defense, and in recent years the US has sold tens of billions of dollars of military equipment to the Gulf nation. The Biden administration, which sees maintaining a lead in AI as crucial for its future economic success and national security, has implemented a series of measures including export controls on AI and semiconductor technologies to slow China\u2019s advancement in the industry. Washington has also limited the sale of sophisticated US chips to ensure China doesn\u2019t use Middle Eastern nations as a back door to access the newest AI technology, according to Reuters. Nvidia, the world\u2019s third biggest company after Microsoft and Apple, said in an August 2023 regulatory filing that the US government had informed the chipmaker that some of its products would face additional licensing requirements for \u201ccertain customers and other regions, including some countries in the Middle East.\u201d Some US politicians have raised concerns that they don\u2019t have enough details about the deal between G42 and Microsoft and that US technology might be vulnerable to Chinese espionage in the UAE. The country has ties to Beijing, too, and China is a key trade partner. Olama insists the UAE is a trustworthy partner. \u201cI really don\u2019t think that there is any risk, especially since there\u2019s a lot of cutting-edge American technology that is in the UAE,\u201d said Olama, adding that he was speaking in his personal capacity, not as a government official. \u2018A leading tech power\u2019 In late 2023, Abu Dhabi\u2019s government-backed Technology Innovation Institute unveiled a large language model (LLM), the technology behind generative AI chatbots, called Falcon10B. It outperformed offerings from Google and Meta by some metrics. \u201cThe UAE put a stake in the ground in the AI race with Falcon,\u201d James Lewis, who studies technology at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a Washington DC-based think tank, told CNN. In October 2023, a collaboration between Abu Dhabi\u2019s Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence, Silicon Valley-based Cerebras Systems and Inception, a subsidiary of G42, produced Jais, a generative AI model trained on Arabic as well as English. Its creators said it could pave the way for LLMs in other languages that are \u201cunderrepresented in mainstream AI.\u201d Unlike ChatGPT and Google\u2019s Gemini, Falcon and Jais are open-source, which means their code is available for anyone to use or change. By opening up the technology, Abu Dhabi is positioning itself as an ally to developing nations that don\u2019t have the resources to build their own AI tools. \u201cWe know that not every country can develop these systems or these tools,\u201d said Olama. \u201cSo, we want to ensure that we\u2019re able to develop it for them.\u201d Some analysts say the UAE\u2019s vast oil wealth will be key in developing hugely expensive AI infrastructure. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s a financial story,\u201d said Lewis. \u201cIt gives them an edge in terms of being one of the leading tech powers in the future.\u201d As fears grow about the potential risks of AI, Olama has called for a global coalition to regulate the development and use of the technology. The stakes are high. In March, a report commissioned by the US State Department warned that the most advanced AI systems could, in a worst-case scenario, \u201cpose an extinction-level threat to the human species.\u201d Olama has some specific concerns. He expects deepfakes will cause a \u201cfundamental truth crisis\u201d and could drive a \u201cpolitical crisis.\u201d He\u2019s also worried that AI could make it easier to create biotech weapons. \u201cI try not to be a fear mongerer,\u201d he said, \u201cbut there are very few guardrails in place to ensure this doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/tech/uae-ai-minister-omar-al-olama-hnk-spc-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "travel_mount-fuji-japan-visitor-cap-tourist-tax-intl-hnk", "text": "Mount Fuji, a UNESCO World Heritage site and an icon of Japan, has put new regulations in place for climbers amid concerns about overcrowding. Beginning July 1, climbers must pay 2,000 yen ($12.40) per person, with a daily maximum of 4,000 climbers per day. \u201cBy strongly promoting comprehensive safety measures for climbing Mount Fuji, we will ensure that Mount Fuji, a treasure of the world, is passed on to future generations,\u201d said Koutaro Nagasaki, governor of Yamanashi Prefecture, when announcing the new regulations earlier this year. \u201cIn order to revive traditional mountain climbing from the foot of Mount Fuji, we will gain a detailed understanding of the Fuji-ko and Oshi culture that supported Mount Fuji worship. We look to link these cultures to this mountain climbing, as it is rooted in the cultural values of the religion.\u201d Fuji-ko is a religion specific to the mountain. Human traffic jams, foothills littered with garbage and inappropriately attired hikers \u2013 some attempting the ascent in sandals - are among the issues plaguing the popular Japanese site. In addition, there will be new guides who manage safety on and around the trails. They will inform climbers when they\u2019re violating etiquette on the mountain, such as sleeping by the side of the trail, starting a fire or wearing unsuitable clothing. According to prefectural data, five million people hiked Mount Fuji in 2019, a rise of three million from 2012. \u201cOvertourism \u2013 and all the subsequent consequences like rubbish, rising CO2 emissions and reckless hikers \u2013 is the biggest problem facing Mount Fuji,\u201d Masatake Izumi, a Yamanashi prefectural government official, told CNN Travel last year. In 2023, a volunteer named Tomoyo Takahashi told CNN she would ask visitors to voluntarily contribute 1,000 yen ($6.20) toward maintaining the mountain. \u201cNot everyone pays the 1,000 yen, and it makes me sad. There should be a mandatory entrance fee that\u2019s much much higher so only visitors who truly appreciate Mount Fuji\u2019s heritage come,\u201d she said at the time. Now, Takahashi will get her wish. The new rules, though, only apply in Yamanashi prefecture, which is where the more popular hiking trails are. Fuji is also located in Shizuoka prefecture, which has not yet implemented any taxes or visitor limits. Governor Nagasaki told reporters that he and the governor of Shizuoka would meet at the end of the climbing season to compare notes. Japan\u2019s tourism headaches Overtourism has become a bigger issue in Japan since the country reopened following the pandemic. In Kyoto, locals in the historic Gion quarter have expressed their concern with tourists who flock there to photograph and sometimes harass the geisha who live and work there, earning the nickname \u201cgeisha paparazzi.\u201d While the city has put up signs and placards asking visitors not to photograph geisha, some locals told CNN Travel that it wasn\u2019t enough. One suggestion offered by the neighborhood council is issuing fines or tickets. And the town of Hatsukaichi, in Hiroshima prefecture in southwestern Japan, has been affected too. The small town is home to the famous orange \u201cfloating shrine\u201d torii gate, which is part of a 1,400-year-old Shinto complex. In October 2023, the town began charging 100 yen (62 cents) per visitor to the shrine. The money from the \u201ctourist tax\u201d goes toward maintaining the site and its infrastructure.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/mount-fuji-japan-visitor-cap-tourist-tax-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_style_paris-2024-olympic-village", "text": "When Paris last hosted the Summer Olympics 100 years ago, organizers were so keen to bring athletes under the same roof that they built the first-ever Olympic Village. It was spartan, made up of furnished wood huts, and it was razed shortly after. The competition is back in the City of Lights a century later, but French officials are doing something completely different this time around. As part of their effort to make Paris 2024 the \u201cmost responsible and sustainable games in history,\u201d they\u2019re building something that\u2019s meant to last. \u201cThis village was thought up as a neighborhood, a neighborhood that is going to have a life afterwards,\u201d said Georgina Grenon, the Paris 2024 director of sustainability. \u201cParis 2024 is renting it for a few months.\u201d Instead of rooming in apartments tailor-made for them, athletes in the Olympic Village this summer will be living in what will become someone else\u2019s home or workplace. Once the Paralympics have finished on September 8, the village \u2014 which contains 82 buildings \u2014 will be converted into office space for 6,000 workers and apartments to house another 6,000 people. The hope is that the project will provide a model to alleviate a housing crisis in the French capital, where rising interest rates, surging prices and a supply crunch have made it harder than ever to buy or rent a home. Demand for affordable housing is so intense that when a small 10 square meter (108 square feet) apartment in Paris\u2019 up-and-coming 10th arrondissement hit the rental market last year at a price of 610 euros ($614) per month, it attracted a staggering 765 applicants in less than a week. The site for the Olympic Village was chosen in the hopes it would revitalize some of the city\u2019s historically impoverished northern suburbs. The village lies at the juncture of three suburbs: Saint-Denis, a diverse, working-class neighborhood long associated with crime and insecurity; the rapidly gentrifying Saint-Ouen; and Ile-Saint-Denis, an island on the Seine River. Organizers say post-Olympics, 32% of the new homes in Saint-Denis and Saint-Ouen, and 48% of those in Ile-Saint-Denis built for the Games will be set aside for public housing. There\u2019s a risk, however, that current residents could be priced out. Similar pledges to build affordable housing in east London were made in advance of the 2012 Olympics, but those promises ended up largely falling flat. A BBC report in 2022 found that of the 9,000 homes built within the Olympic Park, less than 200 were offered at the cheapest levels of rent. \u2018It\u2019s a huge test lab\u2019 Like the Olympics themselves \u2014 which organizers say will run 100% on renewable energy \u2014 everything built for the village was done with sustainability in mind. To minimize the amount of construction, organizers temporarily or permanently retrofitted several existing structures on the site, including an old electric factory that\u2019s been turned into a \u201cresident center.\u201d They also rented existing movie studios in the area to be used as training facilities for athletes instead of building new training facilities which has been done at some other Games. The buildings that were erected were built with wood and recycled materials, employing processes that, according to Grenon, reduced the project\u2019s carbon footprint by 30% per square meter \u2014 more than French ecological regulations require. A third of all the rooftops are equipped with solar panels, while another third have gardens meant to bring down the temperature inside, Grenon said. And long, straight openings leading to the Seine were left in between the buildings to form wind tunnels carrying the fresh air near the river as far inland as possible. Temperatures this summer are expected to be warmer than normal, according to France\u2019s national weather service, and there is widespread concern heat could jeopardize athlete safety. But the structures themselves aren\u2019t the only thing that will be recycled. The village will house about 3,000 apartments containing a total of 14,250 beds made with recyclable materials similar to the ones used in Tokyo. The mattresses were manufactured with reused materials and their firmness can be adjusted by flipping them over. Stools were made with cardboard meaning they can be easily recycled after the Olympics. Across the village, organizers are running a handful of experiments to see if new green technologies and construction methods are viable in the real world. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge test lab,\u201d Grenon said. One sidewalk has been made with seashells. In theory, those shells are supposed to absorb rain. On hot days, the stored water should evaporate and help cool passers-by. The village\u2019s main drag features five experimental outdoor air filters. These giant, UFO-like towers are designed like vacuums to suck in the polluted air and filter out dangerous particles. The device can clean \u201c95% of the air of the particulate matter \u2014 all sizes,\u201d its creator, Jerome Giacomoni, told CNN. The five devices can clean the equivalent of the volume of 40 Olympic-sized swimming pools an hour with very little electricity consumption, Giacomoni said. Keeping cool The most scrutinized innovation will likely be the geothermal cooling system, as athletes in Paris could face the same level of sweltering heat and humidity that broiled Tokyo during the Summer Olympics there three years ago. \u201cClimate change should increasingly be viewed as an existential threat to sport,\u201d Sebastian Coe, the president of World Athletics, said in a report published last week (June 18) examining the heat risks associated with this summer\u2019s games. While the ground floor of some buildings in the Olympic Village are equipped with traditional air conditioning because they will be converted into shops after the Olympics, the athlete apartments will use geothermal cooling instead of air conditioning. This system takes water cooled to 4 degrees Celsius (39 degrees Fahrenheit) from wells as deep as 70 meters (230 feet) underground at a nearby geothermal plant and transports them to pipes under the floors of each apartment. That cold water should be able to cool the building by 6 to 10 degrees Celsius compared to the temperature outside, according to Laurent Michaud, the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Village director. While the system will be controlled at the building level, each apartment has a thermostat that allows them to lower or raise the temperature by 2 degrees Celsius in each unit. The system will also heat apartments in the winter. The human-caused climate crisis has made heat waves more frequent and intense, and they are starting earlier in the year in many parts of the world. Paris is particularly vulnerable \u2014 people in the French capital are more likely to die from extreme heat than any other city in Europe, a study that looked at more than 850 cities showed. As of 2022, just 19% of all households in Europe were equipped with air conditioning, according to the most recent figures from the International Energy Agency. But extreme heat across the world has driven up global demand for AC units, creating a climate Catch-22, as air conditioning systems use large amounts of energy, much of which still comes from fossil fuels that emit carbon dioxide and heats the planet. For delegations concerned about the system\u2019s efficacy during a heat wave, the village will offer them the option to rent individual air conditioning units. Asked about the lack of air conditioning in the Village by news agency Reuters in March, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo said the village was \u201cdesigned to avoid the need for air conditioning, even in very, very high temperatures.\u201d \u201cWe are on the brink of a precipice. Everyone, including the athletes, must be aware of this,\u201d Hidalgo said. \u201cWe have to trust the scientists when they help us to construct buildings in a sober way that allows us to make do without air conditioning.\u201d CNN\u2019s Saskya Vandoorne and Derek Van Dam contributed to this report", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/style/paris-2024-olympic-village/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_06_26_europe_evan-gershkovich-trial-begin-russia-intl", "text": "Evan Gershkovich, the first American journalist to be arrested on espionage charges in Russia since the Cold War, went on trial Wednesday, appearing in a Russian courtroom\u2019s glass cage with his head recently shaved. Later Wednesday, Gershkovich\u2019s family said the past 15 months had been \u201cextraordinarily painful.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re deeply disappointed that he will have to endure further attempts to discredit him and to paint a picture that is unrecognizable to anyone who knows him. Evan is a journalist, and journalism is not a crime,\u201d his family said in a statement. Gershkovich, 32, was arrested while reporting for the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), which he joined in January 2022, just weeks before Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. While many newsrooms subsequently pulled their reporters out of Russia, Gershkovich remained, covering the war and how it was changing life in the country. He was arrested while on a reporting trip in the city of Yekaterinburg in March 2023 and later accused of spying for the CIA. Gershkovich, the US government, and the WSJ have vehemently denied the charges against him. Within two weeks of his arrest in March 2023, the US State Department designated him as wrongfully detained and called for his immediate release. The press was briefly allowed into the courtroom 15 minutes before Wednesday\u2019s hearing began at 11 a.m. local time (2 a.m. ET). During earlier appeals against his pre-trial detention, Gershkovich has made love-heart signs and given a thumbs-up to his friends, family and supporters. On Wednesday, Gershkovich stood cross-armed, seeming healthy and composed, occasionally smiling and waving to the crowd of reporters. No reporters will be allowed into the courtroom during the trial itself, which is expected to last months. If convicted, he faces up to 20 years in prison. After Wednesday\u2019s hearing wrapped early afternoon, court officials said the trial would resume on August 13, state news agency TASS reported. The trial of Gershkovich, the American-born son of Soviet-era emigres to the US, has highlighted the extent to which Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has harmed relations between Moscow and Washington. In their indictment, Russian prosecutors said that \u201cunder instructions from the CIA\u201d and \u201cusing painstaking conspiratorial methods,\u201d Gershkovich \u201cwas collecting secret information\u201d about a Russian tank factory. Russian authorities have not publicly offered any evidence for their claims. WSJ Editor-in-Chief Emma Tucker said it was \u201cjarring to see him in yet another courtroom for a sham trial held in secret and based on fabricated accusations.\u201d \u201cWhile we are told he\u2019s doing well given the circumstances, Evan\u2019s wrongful detention continues to be a devastating assault on his freedom and his work and an unfathomable attack on the free press. It\u2019s outrageous that he has already endured 455 days in prison when he never should\u2019ve been arrested,\u201d she said in a statement. Pjotr Sauer, Russian affairs reporter for Britain\u2019s The Guardian newspaper and friend of Gershkovich, told CNN, \u201cEvan is just an honest journalist,\u201d and emphasized that Russian authorities have not presented any evidence against him. \u201cWe\u2019re not holding our breath, it could take weeks or months. And we don\u2019t have much trust in the Russian justice system,\u201d said Sauer, who exchanged letters with Gershkovich before the American reporter was transferred to Yekaterinburg. \u201cRealistically, we believe that Russia will convict him because they\u00a0arrested him in the end because he\u2019s a bargaining chip for Moscow, for Putin to be exchanged.\u201d Ahead of the trial, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said the US \u201ccertainly\u201d does not expect Gershkovich to have \u201ca free and fair trial given that these are charges that never should have been brought in the first place.\u201d Miller said embassy personnel were traveling to Yekaterinburg, more than 800 miles from Moscow, and would attempt to attend the trial. Before being transferred to Yekaterinburg, Gershkovich was held in Moscow\u2019s notorious Lefortovo prison, spending almost every hour of the day in a small cell as his pre-trial detention period was extended several times. He has passed the time by writing letters to his friends and family, his parents, Ella Milman and Mikhail Gershkovich, said in a recent interview with the WSJ. \u201cHe\u2019s managing the best way he can, in a tiny space, one hour walking outside \u2013 six steps, six steps, six steps,\u201d Milman said, drawing a small courtyard with her finger. \u201cHe\u2019s been exercising, meditating, reading a lot, answering letters. His knowledge of the Russian language and the culture helped him adjust to the situation.\u201d Political \u2018pawns\u2019 In his State of the Union address in March \u2013 with Gershkovich\u2019s parents in the audience \u2013 US President Joe Biden said his administration was working \u201caround the clock to bring home Evan\u201d and other \u201cAmericans being unjustly detained all around the world.\u201d Shortly after the first day of Gershkovich\u2019s trial concluded, the US Embassy in Moscow demanded Russia stop using him and other detained Americans as \u201cbargaining chips.\u201d \u201cThis trial is not about the presentation of evidence, due process or the rule of law. We are talking about the Kremlin using American citizens to achieve its political goals,\u201d the embassy said. The number of Americans being held in Russia has swelled in recent years. Paul Whelan, a former US Marine, was arrested in Moscow in December 2018 and sentenced to 16 years in prison in 2020 on espionage charges, which he has consistently and vehemently denied. The US State Department has also declared him wrongfully detained. After marking another grim milestone last week, surpassing 2,000 days in Russian custody, Whelan told CNN he has spent \u201can incredible amount of time\u201d in detention \u201cfor a crime that never occurred\u201d as he urged the Biden administration to take \u201cdecisive action\u201d to bring him and Gershkovich home. Brittney Griner \u2013 the basketball star who used to play in Russia during the WNBA offseason \u2013 was detained in Russia and sentenced to nine years in prison after authorities found cannabis oil in her luggage. After spending nearly 300 days behind bars, Griner was freed in a prisoner swap for Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout, nicknamed the \u201cMerchant of Death\u201d by his accusers. A former Soviet military officer, Bout was serving a 25-year sentence in the US on charges of conspiring to kill Americans, acquire and export anti-aircraft missiles and provide material support to a terrorist organization \u2013 charges he and the Kremlin denied. The Kremlin has consistently said that any negotiations regarding a potential prisoner swap\u00a0should be conducted in complete confidentiality, without disclosing any details on the progress of these discussions. Western officials and analysts have accused Russia of using jailed Americans as political pawns. Discussing the case of Ksenia Karelina \u2013 a US-Russian dual citizen also on trial in Yekaterinburg after being accused of donating $51 to a Ukrainian charity \u2013 Russian investigative journalist Andrei Soldatov told CNN that Russia aims \u201cto build up a bank of hostages with American passports,\u201d which Moscow can use \u201cas leverage\u201d in any negotiations with Washington. In an interview with American right-wing pundit Tucker Carlson, Russian President Vladimir Putin suggested the Kremlin could be willing to free Gershkovich in exchange for Vadim Krasikov, a former colonel from Russia\u2019s domestic spy organization who was convicted of assassinating a former Chechen fighter in broad daylight in Berlin in 2019. \u201cListen, I\u2019ll tell you: sitting in one country, a country that is an ally of the United States, is a man who, for patriotic reasons, eliminated a bandit in one of the European capitals,\u201d Putin said.

The legislation, which came into effect Thursday, is part of a larger citizenship overhaul from Berlin as the government grapples with rising antisemitism, a surge in popularity for the far right, and fierce debate over its response to Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. The country\u2019s naturalization exam will now include a number of new questions, according to a statement from the interior ministry. \u201cIn response to increasing antisemitism in Germany, the list of questions in the naturalization test has been expanded. New exam questions have been added on the topics of antisemitism, the right of the state of Israel to exist and Jewish life in Germany,\u201d it said. The war in Gaza, and Berlin\u2019s strong support for Israel, has fueled much discussion in Germany. In the aftermath of the October 7 attacks, German lawmakers, including Chancellor Olaf Scholz, reiterated that Israel\u2019s security is Germany\u2019s \u201creason of state,\u201d or matter of national interest. But other voices in the country have accused authorities of going too far, infringing on the rights of pro-Palestinians to freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. Adding to the complex picture, Germany has the largest Palestinian diaspora in Europe, which is estimated at 300,000. German Green lawmaker Lamya Kaddor previously told CNN that Muslim communities in Germany have felt ostracized in light of events in the Middle East. \u2018A crystal clear red line\u2019 The legislation is being introduced nationwide after the eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt also required citizenship applicants to recognize Israel\u2019s right to exist in December. The implementation of the law on a federal level was advocated by the center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party last year. The idea was also well-received by other parties in the Bundestag. Under the changes, the process for obtaining citizenship has also been sped up. Those who work in Germany and are considered \u201cwell integrated\u201d can now obtain citizenship after just five years instead of eight. Applicants no longer need to give up the citizenship of their previous country \u2013 something that used to be a requirement in Germany for first-generation migrants. Germany\u2019s Interior Minister Nancy Faeser has welcomed Thursday\u2019s changes as a \u201ccommitment to a modern Germany.\u201d \u201cWhoever shares our values and makes an effort can now get a German passport more quickly and are not required to give up a part of their identity with the former citizenship,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe have also made it just as clear: Whoever doesn\u2019t share our values, will not be able to get a German passport. Here we have drawn a crystal clear red line and made the law much stronger than before. Anti-Semitism, racism and other forms of contempt for humanity rule out naturalization. There is no tolerance for that.\u201d The reform comes as a new report from RIAS, an organization monitoring antisemitism in Germany, found that antisemitic incidents in the country rose around 83% last year, significantly increasing after the attack on Israel on October 7 and Israel\u2019s eight-month military offensive in Gaza. These incidents include everything from antisemitic graffiti, to threats, to violent attacks.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/europe/german-citizens-israel-right-to-exist-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_05_25_style_zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk", "text": "Above Beijing\u2019s imperial center rises Jingshan, or Prospect Hill. From a pagoda at its modest peak, a panoramic view of the city presents itself. To the south, the dull golden roofs of the Forbidden City crest and fall, pulling the eye southward to Tiananmen \u2014 the Gate of Heavenly Peace \u2014 and the vast square of the same name just beyond. To the east stand the smooth metallic skyscrapers of the city\u2019s business district. To the north, at the top of Beijing\u2019s central axis \u2014 its so-called dragon\u2019s vein \u2014 sit the Bell and Drum Towers, which once acted as the city\u2019s collective timepiece. And stretching all along the western periphery are the calm, tree-lined waters of the manmade lakes, dug by hand for the pleasure of past emperors. It\u2019s this aerial view of \u201cZhongnanhai,\u201d meaning \u201cmiddle and southern seas,\u201d and the surrounding buildings that today\u2019s Chinese leaders prefer you did not see. That\u2019s because the 1,500-acre site of repurposed imperial pavilions and temples, along with gray modern offices has formed the leadership compound for the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP)  since 1950. As the seat of power, Zhongnanhai is often thought of as China\u2019s equivalent to the White House, or the Kremlin. Synonymous with China\u2019s communist party elite, and among the country\u2019s most secretive places, it is ringed by a centuries-old red ochre wall, with countless CCTV cameras periscoping above it \u2014 and patrolled assiduously by security forces in both plain clothes and uniform. A peaceful getaway For Chinese leader Xi Jinping\u2019s imperial forebears, the site served a somewhat different function. While emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties ruled their vast kingdom from within the Forbidden City, they built temples, halls and living quarters in Zhongnanhai; less grandly ceremonial than those of the palace, they were often oriented to take advantage of the views afforded by the area\u2019s tranquil waters and carefully planned gardens. Many of these emperors came to favor passing their days surrounded by drooping willows in the cool and quiet of this cultivated pleasure garden. A story relayed by the scholar Geremie Barm\u00e9 in his book \u201cThe Forbidden City\u201d tells of the 18th-century Qianlong Emperor\u2019s daily routine at Zhongnanhai: Each morning, after a first breakfast of cold swallows nest soup, he would travel by heated palanquin to the gardens\u2019\u00a0Studio of Convivial Delight,\u00a0a pavilion he built to capitalize on the view of the South Lake, where he would breakfast again on a meal of\u00a018 dishes. As the historian and author of \u201cThe Shortest History of China,\u201d Linda Jaivin, told CNN via email: \u201cThere is something outrageous and yet poetic about the incredible coordination and effort required of a team of bearers, cooks and attendants, just so that an emperor could come, catch a view of the magnificent Ocean Terrace, scoff his food and (leave).\u201d The first ruler to view Zhongnanhai as primarily a place to govern from, not simply relax in, was the Empress Dowager Cixi, who effectively controlled China for almost five decades from 1861. She lived for many years in the gardens\u2019 Hall of Ceremonial Phoenixes, which became the center of political authority in China. She would die there in 1908. The serene surroundings of Zhongnanhai also became, under Cixi, a place of punishment and confinement. In 1898, following attempted reforms that displeased her, Cixi imprisoned her nephew, the Guangxu Emperor, on Yingtai Island, which juts out into the southern lake. Built as a miniature version of the mythical Penglai island, home to the immortals of Chinese legend, the tiny piece of land would become the emperor\u2019s home for most of his life, bar a brief period when the Boxer rebellion of 1900 forced the whole court to flee the capital. He would die on Yingtai Island from arsenic poisoning the day before the Empress Dowager herself. His imprisonment and death, said writer M. A. Aldrich, author of \u201cThe Search for a Vanishing Beijing: A Guide to China\u2019s Capital Through the Ages,\u201d perhaps adds a touch of poignancy for any subsequent resident of Zhongnanhai. \u201cIn addition to being a site that preserves sites of imperial splendor,\u201d he told CNN, \u201cit also functions as a reminder to the political elite about the consequences for stepping out of line.\u201d For Aldrich, however, the Zhongnanhai compound also represents the destructive impulses of the CCP towards its adopted capital in the years after 1949, when Mao Zedong proclaimed the foundation of the People\u2019s Republic. \u201cAs a political symbol of the New China, it has been torn up, rebuilt, expanded, and revamped so many times that its connection with its elegant past has been lost,\u201d Aldrich said. Architectural changes There have been serious revisions to the architecture of Zhongnanhai since the end of imperial rule in 1912. After the last emperor abdicated the throne, China\u2019s new president Yuan Shikai granted him the right to live on the northern section of the Forbidden City \u2014 and then took Zhongnanhai to be his new administration\u2019s headquarters. The changes he made to the imperial gardens were disparaged by many of the Westerners who visited them. \u201cWhatever may be one\u2019s opinion as to whether Yuan Shikai \u2018exalted his aim\u2019 in his political career, he certainly cannot be said to have done so as builder and architect,\u201d wrote L.C. Arlington and William Lewisohn in their 1935 book \u201cIn Search of Old Peking,\u201d \u201cfor all the buildings that have been erected or restored by him are in the worst possible taste.\u201d Most notable of these changes \u2014 at least to ordinary Beijingers \u2014 was the repurposing of a two-story pavilion at the very south of the gardens. Known as the Precious Moon Tower, it had been built decades earlier by the Qianlong Emperor for a homesick lover, a Muslim woman from Xinjiang, taken to Beijing as part of the spoils of war. The concubine would gaze south from the tower toward a mock mosque and bazaar the emperor had especially constructed to assuage her longing for home. Yuan refashioned this pavilion into the main entrance to his presidential compound, and established a tall watchtower just to its east. The gate was named Xinhuamen, or the Gate of New China. Today, the structure remains coated in the same deep red that graces the walls of all Beijing\u2019s imperial buildings, with a roof of glazed yellow tiles and detailing that runs below the roofline, picked out in blue and gold. The gate is now flanked by two red banners that speak to its modern purpose as China\u2019s political and party headquarters: \u201cLong Live the Great Communist Party of China\u201d reads one; and \u201cLong Live the Invincible Mao Zedong Thought\u201d on the other. On a screen wall recessed behind the entrance way, Chinese characters written in Mao\u2019s own calligraphic style declare: \u201cServe the People.\u201d Facing out onto Beijing\u2019s main east-west thoroughfare, the gate remains the most conspicuous part of Zhongnanhai. The rest of the compound has, since 1989, been firmly off-limits to the Chinese public. Seat of power Initially, after the communist victory in China\u2019s civil war in 1949, Mao Zedong took up residence at Shuangqing Villa in Fragrant Hills, another former imperial garden to the west of Beijing. Though wary of establishing himself in the imperial heart of Beijing \u2014 it is said that he refused ever to enter the Forbidden City, for fear of being associated with the power structures of old, feudal China he had fought to overthrow \u2014 Mao ultimately moved into Zhongnanhai and, in late 1949, he set up in the\u00a0Garden of Abundant Beneficence,\u00a0a large courtyard compound favored by both the Qianlong and Kangxi emperors, where he would hold court with dignitaries\u00a0and live\u00a0until 1966. Having re-established Zhongnanhai as a center of political power in the new China, Mao set about rebuilding the compound according to his tastes. \u201cSince 1949, an assortment of new architecture styles has encroached into Zhongnanhai, with a tennis court, gymnasium, swimming pools and Western buildings topped off with Chinese eave roofs adding a discordant note that would not have been appreciated by its traditionally-minded original owners,\u201d said Aldrich. In 1966, Mao moved from the Garden of Abundant Beneficence to a specially built house beside his beloved indoor swimming pool. He often summoned officials to speak to him as he bobbed in the water \u2014 and famously received Russian leader Nikita Khrushchev at his pool during a 1958 visit. \u201cTheir interpreters had to pace alongside the edge of the pool,\u201d said Jaivin. \u201cThe Russian couldn\u2019t swim and had to wear water wings. Mao loved both swimming and putting Khrushchev in his place. Finally, Khrushchev got sick of it, and clambered out to sit on the edge, dangling his feet in the water.\u201d In the residence next door, Mao lined his rooms with bookshelves housing an extensive library of Chinese classical literature. \u201cIt was here,\u201d noted Aldrich, \u201cwith the background trappings of a scholar, that he met Nixon and Kissinger in 1972.\u201d Most subsequent leaders have preferred to keep a house outside the Zhongnanhai compound. Deng Xiaoping lived, from 1977, in a courtyard house on a nearby lane adjacent to Beihai, the \u201cNorthern Sea\u201d of central Beijing\u2019s chain of lakes. While not officially disclosed, it is believed that more contemporary leaders, including Xi Jinping and his predecessors Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, have maintained homes in an exclusive gated compound in Jade Spring Hill, sometimes called the \u201cback garden\u201d of Chinese politics, out to the city\u2019s west. Aldrich noted that those leaders and party cadres who used Zhongnanhai as their primary residence often attracted unwelcome scrutiny for their activities, particularly during years of political turbulence. \u201cIn his memoirs, Chairman Mao\u2019s physician, Li Zhisui, commented that (the complex\u2019s) residents were always under surveillance,\u201d Aldrich said. \u201cDuring the Cultural Revolution, the simple act of making a fire would bring down the wrath of the security guards on the perpetrator. It was believed that such a fire was proof that incriminating or seditious materials were being destroyed.\u201d The imperial gardens offering vistas of Zhongnanhai\u2019s lakes have, today, been filled in with dozens of gray offices and meeting halls, many of which date to 1970s, when Zhongnanhai underwent significant razing and renovation \u2014 the rebuilding was so extensive that one visitor in 1979 described the grounds resembling a construction site, with muddy roads that were impossible to walk on. The contemporary compound splits roughly in two, with the northern buildings, on the banks of the \u201cmiddle lake,\u201d used as the headquarters of China\u2019s top executive body, the State Council. It is here that foreign dignitaries are admitted. Around the \u201csouthern lake,\u201d meanwhile, are the headquarters of the CCP, including, within Qinzheng Hall (the Hall of Diligent Government), the offices of the general secretary of the party (a post currently held by Xi). Many of the most historically significant political events to occur at Zhongnanhai have taken place in Huairen Hall, or the Hall of Cherished Compassion, on the western side of the Middle Lake. The hall was added to the imperial park during the late Qing dynasty, but was then extensively remodeled by the CCP in the early 1950s to impart a more august socialist grandeur. It is a broad, imposing ceremonial hall with staggered roofs of glazed green tiles falling in curved lines to upturned corners; the facade of austere grey brick is interrupted by red wooden pillars, windows and doors. The building\u2019s capacious interior houses a large auditorium, as well as numerous smaller meeting rooms. The hall has, for decades, served as the main meeting place for China\u2019s Politburo, the party\u2019s decision-making body usually comprising about two dozen members. On occasion, it has also hosted the Politburo\u2019s Standing Committee, the core of China\u2019s political elite, (the power of both bodies has notably dwindled in the era of Xi), though they most commonly meet in Qinzheng Hall, close to the general secretary\u2019s office. During the tumult of the Cultural Revolution vital discussions and debates occurred at Huairen Hall, and, in the months after its conclusion, it was there that three of the so-called Gang of Four \u2014 the political faction that included Mao\u2019s wife held responsible for the worst excesses of the era \u2014 were arrested, tricked into attending a meeting they thought was about the publication of the fifth volume of Mao\u2019s Selected Works. In April 1989, former party head Hu Yaobang suffered a heart-attack during a Politburo meeting at Huairen; his death a week later would trigger the Tiananmen Square protests that the government forcibly cracked down on in early June of that year. However, the compound hasn\u2019t always been so forbidden for the masses following the collapse of China\u2019s imperial dynasty. In the late 1920s, it became a park, with tourists allowed to boat on and swim in the lakes, while in the 1980s, the public could access some of its scenic and historical spots, including\u00a0Mao\u2019s\u00a0former residence, on\u00a0organized weekend tours.\u00a0Even early in 1989, a journalist for the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0was able to casually\u00a0drive\u00a0a senior official into the compound and drop him off inside.\u00a0During a period of warmer US and China relations in 2011, former Chinese president\u00a0Hu Jintao\u00a0invited\u00a0a group of American high school students to Zhongnanhai. Modern security concerns Today, Zhongnanhai is more closely-guarded than ever, though the inexorable development of the city has caused problems in maintaining the compound\u2019s secrecy. When an annex to the nearby Beijing Hotel was built in\u00a01973, authorities were panicked by the realization that from its upper floors one could quite easily see \u2013 and potentially target a sniper rifle \u2013 into Zhongnanhai. A building was hastily erected on the western edge of the Forbidden City to restrict this view. Likewise in 2018, when Beijing\u2019s new tallest building was\u00a0completed\u00a0\u2013 the 528-meter Citic tower, better known as the \u201cZun\u201d \u2013 the country\u2019s national security apparatus reportedly requisitioned the top floors amid fears that visitors or occupants might be able to spy into the compound. Beijing authorities did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on the security situation at the time. Zhongnanhai\u2019s entrance, Xinhuamen, has also been the site of repeated demonstrations in recent decades; in 1989, it was a gathering point for students taking part in the Tiananmen protests, whilst in 1999, more than 10,000 members of the since-banned Falun Gong gathered on the sidewalks near Zhongnanhai to protest their treatment at the hands of the government. So, while Zhongnanhai is sometimes compared to the White House, Aldrich argues that the paranoia with which the compound is today guarded makes it more like the imperial palace of centuries past: \u201cSince ordinary people are not allowed to enter Zhongnanhai, it is probably more appropriate to describe it as a \u2018New Forbidden City\u2019 for China\u2019s ruling elite rather than a place with a personal political resonance for the average citizen,\u201d he said. \u201cHeck, even the Kremlin is open to tourists!\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/style/zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_europe_europe-election-youth-far-right-intl-cmd", "text": "Pollsters were surprised by the burst of populism in 2016, but many now think they shouldn\u2019t have been. In the United States and United Kingdom, swaths of voters in deprived regions \u2013 places \u201cleft behind\u201d by globalization \u2013 were given the chance to stick it to the system, and they took it. Why was anyone surprised? Pollsters have now been surprised by another trend. In this month\u2019s European Parliament elections, far-right parties performed predictably well \u2013 but especially, and unexpectedly, among young people. A few years ago, \u201cGeneration Climate\u201d \u2013 thought to be unquestionably liberal and progressive \u2013 were voting mostly green. But now, their vote has helped far-right parties capture one in four seats in Brussels. What happened? Perhaps the \u201cleft behind\u201d is not only a geographical phenomenon, but generational. Gen-Z - those born between 1995 and 2012 - has been baptized in crises: first the financial, then the eurozone, then of the pandemic and now of war in Europe. More and more young people believe they will have harder lives than their parents. Why should a left-behind generation be less vulnerable to the lure of populism than left-behind places? Roberto Foa, co-director of the Centre for the Future of Democracy at the University of Cambridge, a leading researcher of youth dissatisfaction with democracy, sees \u201ctwo big divides\u201d in Western societies: \u201cThe wealth divide between economically successful and left-behind regions, and the intergenerational divide in life opportunities.\u201d Political scientists may have overlooked both cohorts because they have long been disconnected. But now their apathy is turning into antipathy \u2013 a desire, once more, to stick it to the system. \u201cIf you are a political entrepreneur who is seeking to break the established party system, those are your options, in terms of mobilizing fresh support,\u201d Foa told CNN. The trend, he says, has been a long time coming: \u201cI\u2019m surprised that people are surprised.\u201d Youth support for far-right parties is being felt in several European countries. In Germany, the Alternative for Germany (AfD), won 16% of the under-25 vote in the EU elections \u2013 tripling its share in that demographic from the previous vote in 2019. Among French voters under 34, the National Rally (RN) was the most popular party, with 32% of the vote \u2013 a 10-point rise compared to 2019. In Poland, 30% of under-30 voters supported the far-right Confederation party, up from 18.5% in 2019. Far-right parties enjoyed a similar uptick in support in the Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, Austria, and continued to do well in Italy. How alarmed \u2013 and surprised \u2013 should mainstream parties be? Generation, not geography Consider these policy proposals. Young people will pay no income tax. If they start a business, they will be exempt from corporation tax for five years. Students working part-time will have their wages topped up by the state, which will also build 100,000 units of student housing. They can also travel by train for free. You\u2019d be forgiven for thinking this must be the platform of the far left. But no: This was RN doyenne Marine Le Pen\u2019s offer in the 2022 French presidential election, which she narrowly lost. Young people, unsurprisingly, loved it. Just under 50% of 25-to-34-year-olds who cast a vote opted for Le Pen, compared to just 41% of the general population and 29% of voters over 70. Whereas the \u201cgray vote\u201d took Donald Trump to the White House and Britain from the EU, it kept the French far right at bay. That may soon change. After his Renaissance party was trounced by the far-right in the EU elections, President Emmanuel Macron called a snap parliamentary election, which could result in Jordan Bardella, the RN\u2019s 28-year-old leader, becoming France\u2019s prime minister next month. For Arthur Prevot, manager of the RN\u2019s youth wing in Paris, this is great news. Macron\u2019s presidency has failed to deliver for young people, he says. \u201cPurchasing power has decreased incredibly over the past seven years. Between the \u2018gilets jaunes\u2019 crisis, the rise in fuel prices, and all the different taxes that have been introduced \u2013 all of this impacts daily life, including mine,\u201d Prevot, 22, told CNN. His economic concerns prompted him to join the party which may soon govern France, although Macron will remain president. Jonathan Verbeken, a deputy RN candidate in Paris\u2019 15th district, said the main reason he joined the party was because, \u201cwe see people suffering daily, struggling to make ends meet. We see a deplorable situation in France, specifically with security and immigration. We want to react to that.\u201d To many older voters, the RN remains a terrifying prospect. Despite its years-long effort to \u201cnormalize,\u201d previous generations remember its antisemitic, neofascist origins. But young voters appear less concerned by these roots, says Simon Schnetzer, author of a recent survey of Germany\u2019s youth. \u201cYoung people are first-time voters. They are a blank sheet. What drives their decisions most is: Who can offer me something that best fits my needs?\u201d he told CNN. The lack of historical baggage, coupled with the strange death of center-left parties in many parts of Europe, has allowed the far right to appear respectable and armed with economic solutions to young people\u2019s problems. Sarah-Lee Heinrichs, a 23-year-old politician for the German Green Party, said economic concerns have become far more prevalent among young people since the last European Parliament elections in 2019, when the Greens became the second largest party in Germany for the first time. In the wake of the pandemic, the full-scale war in Ukraine and the return of soaring inflation, environmentalism is no longer young people\u2019s priority, she says. \u201cIf governments don\u2019t provide social security \u2013 good jobs and a place to live that doesn\u2019t cost more than 50% of your income every month \u2013 then the far-right will rise,\u201d Heinrichs told CNN. And with economic insecurity is coming fiercer opposition to immigration, nearly a decade after the continent \u2013 and especially Germany - welcomed a record number of refugees fleeing war in Syria. An alarming new trend began last month, after a short clip filmed on the German vacation island of Sylt was posted on X. In the video, well-dressed German youths belt out \u201cAusl\u00e4nder Raus!\u201d (\u201cforeigners out!\u201d) and \u201cDeutschland den Deutschen!\u201d (\u201cGermany for Germans!\u201d) over a 1999 Eurodance beat. The chant has since swirled across the country, currently hosting the European soccer championships. Its appeal is not confined to Germans. As Italy played Spain last week, fans in the stadium could be heard giving their own rendition. Swiping right If that\u2019s the \u201cdemand\u201d side, what about the supply? After her center-right bloc secured the most seats in the European Parliament, President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen took to the stage in Brussels to give a victory speech. But her tone was more somber than victorious. She spoke of the importance of defending European values: integration, democracy and the rule of law. How do these abstract values sound to young voters? \u201cYoung people will double check, does that help me with any of my needs? Does it entertain me? Does it give me security? Is it fun? And if it\u2019s none of that, it\u2019s boring,\u201d said Schnetzer. \u201cIf you have this TikTok logic, you\u2019ll quickly swipe further.\u201d While Europe\u2019s mainstream gives grave speeches, the far right is developing vast followings on social media platform TikTok. The RN\u2019s clean-shaven Bardella posts videos of himself wine tasting and doing shots. Maximilian Krah, the AfD\u2019s lead candidate going into\u00a0the EU elections, offers his followers dating advice: \u201cDon\u2019t watch porn, don\u2019t vote for the Greens.\u201d In one TikTok, Nigel Farage \u2013 often described as the \u201carchitect\u201d of Brexit \u2013 approaches a fruit store, says \u201clovely melons,\u201d raises his eyebrows and walks off. The clip has been viewed 2.5 million times. Farage seems aware of this burgeoning market and keen to exploit it. In a recent interview, he praised misogynist online influencer Andrew Tate for being an \u201cimportant voice\u201d for \u201cemasculated\u201d young boys. Tate \u2013 who has racked up billions of views on TikTok \u2013 is facing charges in Romania of human trafficking and rape, which he denies. But those who have puzzled over Tate\u2019s appeal to young men should not be surprised that politicians making jokes about breasts enjoy similar success. The distinction between politicians and entertainment has long grown fuzzy \u2013 but for today\u2019s young, they no longer even exist in separate spaces. Just one swipe separates the voice of a figure like Tate and the voice of a politician. We shouldn\u2019t be surprised if here is where ideas are shaped. Thrill of the new It is not yet clear how deeply these far-right sympathies are held. In a trend especially pronounced among young people, voters are increasingly \u201cnot loyal to any particular party or platform,\u201d says Foa. \u201cThey\u2019re very volatile between one election and the next.\u201d Just as young voters campaigned vociferously for green parties in 2019, their allegiances could switch again. The appeal of the far right may also be dampened if its politicians begin to govern. Out of office, the far right is unable to break promises, while it can point endlessly to the mainstream\u2019s inability to deliver. Once in government, it will prove just as disappointing. That, at least, appears to be\u00a0Macron\u2019s theory. But the burst in support for far-right parties could spell a darker trend. In his studies of youth dissatisfaction with democracy, Foa noted a growing penchant for authoritarianism. Lacking a personal memory of life under authoritarian rule or the struggle to achieve democracy, young people are less enamored with the system than previous generations. This success of far-right parties should be a warning to Europe\u2019s mainstream. To Churchill\u2019s famous quote, \u201cDemocracy is the worst form of government, except for all the others,\u201d we should not be surprised if young people ask in reply: \u201cReally?\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/europe/europe-election-youth-far-right-intl-cmd/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "world"}}

The latest people to be apprehended were the former commanding general of the air force, a sergeant accused of ramming a military vehicle into the government palace, another sergeant accused of driving a separate vehicle carrying military leaders, and an infantry captain accused of coordinating the movement of troops, according to Government Minister Eduardo del Castillo. The news brings the total number of arrests to 21. Wednesday\u2019s coup attempt prompted shock around the world, with images out of the capital La Paz showing military personnel occupying a square, armored vehicles ramming the palace door and soldiers trying to break into government offices. A report sent to CNN by the Bolivian government said military officials first held meetings in May to plot the coup attempt. The meetings were led by former army chief Gen. Juan Jose Z\u00fa\u00f1iga and former navy commander Gen. Juan Arnez, with Z\u00fa\u00f1iga\u2019s civilian personal adviser allegedly devising the \u201cstrategy\u201d of the coup, the report claims. All three men are\u00a0among those arrested so far.

{"id": "2024_06_29_middleeast_us-new-language-hamas-israel-framework-intl", "text": "The United States has proposed new language to bridge gaps in discussions for a ceasefire and hostage deal between Israel and Hamas, a senior US administration official said Friday. The three-phase Israeli proposal, outlined by US President Joe Biden last month, sets out conditions intended to lead to the eventual release of all remaining hostages being held by Hamas, in return for a permanent ceasefire and withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. But dashing hopes for a breakthrough, earlier this month Hamas responded to the Israeli proposal with further amendments. Israel has also not publicly accepted the plan. CNN contributor Barak Ravid first reported the news in Axios, citing three unnamed sources with direct knowledge. The US is pushing Egypt and Qatar to press Hamas to accept the change in language, according to Ravid. One source cited by Ravid said that if Hamas accepts the new language, it will \u201callow to close the deal.\u201d According to the sources cited by Ravid, the new language presented by the US focuses on the period during the first phase of the proposal where Israel and Hamas are expected to start more negotiations with the intention of activating a second phase, where a sustainable ceasefire in Gaza is implemented. The proposed US language aims to bridge a current disagreement triggered by Hamas\u2019 demands that negotiations for the second phase only focus on the number and identity of Palestinian prisoners released from Israeli jails as part of the deal, while Israel wants to have the ability to raise demilitarization of Gaza and other issues, the sources said according to Ravid. CNN has not seen the latest proposal and has reached out to Qatari and Egyptian officials. The second phase of the proposal has been a source of disagreement in the months-long negotiation between Israel and Hamas. Hamas has called for a permanent end to the war and a complete Israeli military withdrawal, while Israeli politicians, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, had vowed for the continuation of the war until Hamas are eliminated. On Sunday, Netanyahu told Israel\u2019s Channel 14 he was ready to make \u201ca partial deal\u201d with Hamas to return only some hostages from Gaza, in comments that were at odds with the proposal. Netanyahu added that Israel will continue fighting in the enclave after the ceasefire. He walked back the comments a day later after fierce backlash from families of the hostages and several Israeli politicians. Hamas spokesman Osama Hamdan told a news conference in Beirut Saturday that the most recent proposal it received was on June 24 and it fell short of meeting its demands for a permanent ceasefire and complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip. \u201cThere is no real change in the negotiation to stop the hostilities until now, what is being reported on behalf of the US administration is within the context of applying pressure on (Hamas) to accept the Israeli proposal without any amendments,\u201d Hamdan said. Any proposal that did not include Hamas\u2019s core demands on a ceasefire and withdrawal was \u201ca waste of time,\u201d Hamdan added. He cited Netanyahu\u2019s remarks in the Channel 14 interview as showing that Israel will \u201ccontinue refusing to accept a permanent ceasefire and do not accept a complete withdrawal from the Gaza Strip.\u201d Hamdan said he holds Netanyahu and his government responsible for the stall, describing Israel\u2019s position as an \u201cequivocation and evasion\u201d from the articles of the agreement. He also accused the US administration of being \u201cconniving\u201d in holding Hamas responsible for stalling the agreement, saying the group welcomed Biden\u2019s speech at the end of May and the UN Security Council resolution endorsing the proposal on the table. An Israeli government official said late Saturday that Israel is committed to the wording of the proposal that Biden welcomed and that its position has not changed. \u201cUp to this moment, Hamas has not responded to this proposal,\u201d the official said. Fighting meanwhile continued in a neighborhood of\u00a0Gaza\u00a0City, according to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and local officials, months after Israel said it had dismantled Hamas in the north. \u201cTroops are continuing operational activity against terror targets in the Shejaiya area, fighting simultaneously above and below ground,\u201d the IDF said, adding that the Israeli Air Force \u201cstruck terror targets and armed terrorist cells\u201d as part of their operations in the neighborhood, which began on Thursday. Gaza\u2019s civil defense officials said they had received numerous calls for help from injured people trapped by fighting in Shujaiya. \u201cA number of victims are still under the rubble and on the roads, and ambulance and civil defense crews cannot reach them,\u201d the Palestinian Ministry of Health in\u00a0Gaza said. The total number of Palestinians killed in\u00a0Gaza\u00a0since Oct. 7 is now 37,834, while the number of injuries has risen to 86,858.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/29/middleeast/us-new-language-hamas-israel-framework-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "world"}}

With five minutes remaining of normal time, Randal Kolo Muani\u2019s effort deflected off helpless Belgium defender Jan Vertonghen to secure France\u2019s win. It was a tight affair at the D\u00fcsseldorf Arena, with little to separate the two sides, with French superstar Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 \u2013 once gain playing in a mask for the broken nose he suffered earlier in the tournament \u2013 often on the periphery on the game. Both Belgium and France haven\u2019t quite hit their their stride at Euro 2024 and Monday\u2019s game followed a similar pattern, with just a few chances and defenses on top \u2013 until Vertonghen reacted slowly to Kolo Muani\u2019s shot. France will now face either Portugal and Slovenia in the quarterfinals, with those two teams playing later on Monday in Frankfurt. A tight affair France started more confidently in D\u00fcsseldorf, dominating possession early on, though Les Bleus was unable to meaningfully trouble Koen Casteels in the Belgium goal. Eventually Domenico Tedesco\u2019s Belgium team was able to get a foothold in the game, with captain Kevin De Bruyne\u2019s freekick almost sneaking in. The first real opening of the game fell to France striker Marcus Thuram when his close-range header flew past the post after a glorious cross from Jules Kound\u00e9. France continued to pile on the pressure, with Aur\u00e9lien Tchouam\u00e9ni blazing over from inside the box after some industrious work on the wing by Mbapp\u00e9. After the halftime break, Tchouam\u00e9ni forced Casteels into his first real save as the Real Madrid\u2019s deflected effort looked to be going in before the Belgium goalkeeper pushed the shot away. Moments later, Thuram went close with his close-range header flying over the bar. Didier Deschamps\u2019s side continued to be in the ascendancy, with Mbapp\u00e9 showing his fleet-footedness to evade defenders before sending a fierce effort just over the bar. Against the run of play, Belgium\u2019s Yannick Carrasco was put through on goal with just Mike Maignan to beat but French defender Theo Hern\u00e1ndez slid in with a perfectly-timed block at the last moment. Belgium\u2019s all-time leading goal scorer Romelu Lukaku was the next to have a shot on target, with Maignan comfortably parrying it away. Two-time European champion France has reached the final in three of the last four major international tournaments \u2013 the World Cup in 2022 and 2018 and Euro 2016 \u2013  and is now just three wins away from lifting another major trophy. Meanwhile, UEFA said it will investigate England midfielder Jude Bellingham for a gesture he made after scoring against Slovakia on Sunday. The 21-year-old was seen appearing to make a gesture similar to grabbing his crotch in the aftermath of his 95th-minute goal against Slovakia, which sent to the game to extra time, with England progressing to the quarterfinals after a 2-1 win. European football\u2019s governing body announced it is looking into a \u201cpotential violation of the basic rules of decent conduct\u201d by Bellingham. Bellingham denied there was any ill will directed towards the Slovakian team with the gesture, writing on X: \u201cAn inside joke gesture towards some close friends who were at the game. Nothing but respect for how that Slovakia team played tonight.\u201d This story has been updated with additional information.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/sport/france-belgium-last-16-euro-2024-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_01_weather_hurricane-beryl-caribbean-landfall-monday", "text": "Hurricane Beryl roared across the Windward Islands on Monday as an extremely dangerous Category 4, delivering catastrophic winds, intense rainfall and life-threatening storm surge. And the storm has become \u201ceven stronger as it moves quickly across the southeastern Caribbean,\u201d the National Hurricane Center warned Monday evening, with winds just 2 mph short of a Category 5 hurricane. \u201cFluctuations in strength are likely during the next day or so, but Beryl is expected to remain an extremely dangerous major hurricane as its moves over the eastern Caribbean,\u201d the center said. Beryl made landfall shortly after 11:00 a.m. EDT on Grenada\u2019s Carriacou Island in the Caribbean Sea with max winds of 150 mph. It is the strongest\u00a0known hurricane to pass through the Grenadines, according to data from NOAA that goes back to 1851. There were \u201cwidespread reports of destruction and devastation in Carriacou and Petite Martinique,\u201d Grenada Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell said in a Monday news briefing. \u201cIn half an hour, Carriacou was flattened.\u201d Mitchell said there were no immediate reports of death or injury but warned that could change. \u201cYou have to appreciate the ferocity and the strength of the\u00a0hurricane\u00a0and therefore we are not yet out of the woods,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we are not able to say for sure that no one has been injured or there has been no loss of life as a result of the\u00a0hurricane.\u201d The storm knocked out power across the island chain. About 95% of the island of Grenada has lost power due to Hurricane\u00a0Beryl, Neila K. Ettienne, press secretary for the office of the prime minister, told CNN on Monday. Telecommunications across Grenada\u00a0are down, and some individuals have lost internet service, Ettienne explained. All schools and business are closed, including the airport, the secretary said, adding only hospitals and the national police force are currently operational. The airport reported a sustained wind speed of 92 mph and a gust of 121 mph Monday afternoon, according to the National Hurricane Center. Beryl\u2019s arrival\u00a0marks an exceptionally early start to the Atlantic hurricane season. On Sunday it became the earliest Category 4 on record in the Atlantic Ocean and the only Category 4 in the month of June. The abnormally warm ocean waters that facilitated Beryl\u2019s alarming strengthening are a clear indicator that this hurricane season will be far from normal in a world warming due to fossil fuel pollution. Beryl is breaking records for June because the ocean is as warm now as it would normally be at the peak of hurricane season, said Jim Kossin, a hurricane expert and science advisor at nonprofit First Street Foundation. \u201cHurricanes don\u2019t know what month it is, they only know what their ambient environment is,\u201d Kossin told CNN. \u201cBeryl is breaking records for the month of June because Beryl thinks it\u2019s September.\u201d Kossin added the ocean heat fueling Beryl\u2019s unprecedented strengthening \u201ccertainly have a human fingerprint on them.\u201d The latest on Beryl: \u2022 Beryl is a dangerous hurricane:\u00a0The storm was located 575 miles east-southeast of Isla Beata in the Dominican Republic, had sustained winds of 155 mph and was moving to the west-northwest at 21 mph as of Monday evening. Beryl\u2019s hurricane-force winds extend 40 miles from center while tropical-storm-force winds extend about 125 miles. The storm\u2019s center is expected to move away from the southern Windward Islands Monday night and across the southeastern and central Caribbean Sea through Tuesday, and is forecast to pass near Jamaica on Wednesday. \u2022 Life-threatening storm surge and flooding:\u00a0The National Hurricane Center warned \u201clife-threatening storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 6 to 9 feet above normal tide levels in areas of onshore winds near where the eye makes landfall in the hurricane warning area.\u201d The center also noted large swells from the storm will continue in the Windward and southern Leeward Islands for the next couple of days. \u201cSwells are also expected to reach the southern coasts of Puerto Rico and Hispaniola late tonight into Tuesday. These swells are expected to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions,\u201d it said. \u2022 Hurricane warning: In effect for Jamaica, with hurricane conditions possible by Wednesday. Tropical storm warnings are in effect for the south coast of Dominican Republic from Punta Palenque westward to the border with Haiti, and the south coast of Haiti from the border with the Dominican Republic to Anse-d\u2019Hainault. \u2022 Hundreds evacuated: More than 400 people were being housed in hurricane shelters across Barbados on Sunday night, the nation\u2019s Chief Shelter Warden, Ramona Archer-Bradshaw, told CNN affiliate CBC News. \u2022 State of emergency in Grenada: A state of emergency declared Sunday night by Grenadian Gov. General C\u00e9cile La Grenade will remain in effect until Tuesday morning. All businesses have closed except the police force, hospitals, prisons, waste disposal and ports. \u2022 Airports remain closed: Airports in Barbados, Grenada and Saint Lucia were closed Sunday night as Beryl approached. Grenada\u2019s Maurice Bishop International Airport is expected to reopen Tuesday morning, a spokesperson said. The Grantley Adams International Airport in Barbados and St. Lucia\u2019s Hewanorra International and George Charles airports have also halted operations. \u2022 Cricket World Cup fans stuck:\u00a0Barbados is still hosting cricket fans from around the globe who traveled to the island for the T20 World Cup, some of whom are not scheduled to leave until Monday or Tuesday, said Barbados Prime Minister Mia Amor Mottley. \u201cSome of them have never gone through a hurricane or a storm before,\u201d she added, imploring residents to provide support for visitors, if possible. Where Beryl is headed next Landfall is far from the end of Beryl\u2019s story, and its long-term path is still uncertain. The hurricane will track generally west or northwest over the Caribbean Sea through Thursday, and is expected to remain a major hurricane \u2013 Category 3 or stronger \u2013 into midweek before losing a bit of strength. Even so, the hurricane will remain formidable with strong winds, torrential rain and hazardous seas extending well beyond its center over much of the Caribbean. Beryl\u2019s center could pass just south of Jamaica on Wednesday and bring heavier impacts to the country even if it doesn\u2019t make landfall there. \u201cStorm surge could raise water levels by as much as 2 to 4 feet above normal tide levels in areas of onshore winds along the immediate coast of Jamaica,\u201d the hurricane center said. Several days are likely to elapse between Beryl\u2019s first landfall in the Windward Islands Monday and its next likely landfall on or around Mexico\u2019s Yucatan Peninsula around Friday morning. What happens after Beryl\u2019s next landfall will also determine if the cyclone is able to reach the Gulf of Mexico over the weekend. If Beryl is able to survive its journey over land and reach the bathtub-warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico, it could spell trouble for northeast Mexico or possibly the US Gulf Coast. An unprecedented start to hurricane season This season is already off to a busy start as a second storm \u2013 Tropical Storm Chris \u2013 made landfall near Tuxpan, Mexico, off the Gulf Coast early Monday. Beryl is ushering in a troubling start to a hurricane season that forecasters have warned will be hyperactive \u2013 and Beryl\u2019s record-shattering activity may be a sign of what\u2019s to come. Beryl is the earliest\u00a0major hurricane \u2013 defined as one that is Category 3 or higher \u2013 in the Atlantic in 58 years. The storm\u2019s rapid intensification is very atypical this early into hurricane season, according to National Hurricane Center Director Mike Brennan. It\u2019s rare for tropical systems to form in the central Atlantic east of the Lesser Antilles in June, particularly strong ones, as only a handful of tropical systems have done so,\u00a0according to NOAA records. The storm isn\u2019t just early for this season. It is now the Atlantic Ocean\u2019s third-earliest major hurricane. The earliest was Hurricane Alma on June 8, 1966, followed by Hurricane Audrey, which reached major hurricane status on June 27, 1957. Beryl has also set the record for the easternmost hurricane to form in the Tropical Atlantic in June, beating a previous record set in 1933. If Beryl should become a Category 5, it would be the second time an Atlantic hurricane reached this strength in July, following Emily in 2005 \u2014 and the earliest Category 5 storm on record. The central and eastern Atlantic traditionally become more active in August, in part because ocean temperatures have had time to warm and fuel developing systems. This year, however, the Atlantic basin has seen above normal water temperatures and a lack of wind shear due to the transition from El Ni\u00f1o season to La Ni\u00f1a season, both of which are fuel for tropical development. \u201cBeryl\u00a0has found an environment with very warm ocean waters for this time of year,\u201d Brennan said. Systems forming this early in the summer in this part of the Atlantic\u00a0is a sign of the hyperactive hurricane season to come, according to\u00a0research from\u00a0Phil Klotzbach, a hurricane expert and research scientist at Colorado State University.\u00a0Normally, ocean temperatures aren\u2019t warm enough in June and July to help tropical systems thrive. National Weather Service\u00a0forecasters\u00a0predict\u00a017 to 25 named storms this season, with as many as 13 of those becoming hurricanes. \u201cThat\u2019s well above average,\u201d Brennan noted.

Rioters threw stones at police officers and the car of Minister Yitzhak Goldknopf as he returned to his house, according to an Israeli police spokesperson. Protesters also set trash cans and the road on fire, blocking the highway. Goldknopf\u2019s spokesperson confirmed to CNN that police evacuated him safely from the area a few minutes after the attack and he was not injured. Goldknopf is the minister of housing and construction and the head of the United Torah Judaism party. Social media videos showed protesters surrounding the minister\u2019s car with some banging on its windows. Other videos showed children and teen protesters walking near to dumpster fires. Ultra-Orthodox Jews have been protesting in the streets of Jerusalem since the Israeli Supreme Court\u00a0issued a ruling\u00a0Tuesday ordering the government to draft ultra-Orthodox Jews into the military. Since Israel\u2019s founding, ultra-Orthodox Jews have been exempted from mandatory military service.

Though both men and women are subject to Israel\u2019s mandatory conscription, the ruling only applies to ultra-Orthodox men. Police said they had to use force to disperse the protesters after orders for them to leave were ignored. Five people were arrested, two of them for attacking police officers, and three others for throwing stones or other objects, the police said in a statement. Some officers are remaining in the area to direct traffic and prevent further disturbances, the police said. \u201cThe police take seriously the attempts of those violent lawbreakers to hurt Israeli police officers with stones, sticks, eggs and other things. There is no connection between a lawful protest and criminal and violent conduct of this type \u2013 which may lead to injury to body and property,\u201d the police said in a statement. \u201cThe conduct of those who disturb the order and break the law in the area deserves every reproach.

{"id": "2024_06_28_asia_ratan-tata-sick-dog-scli-intl", "text": "A super-rich Indian businessman took to social media to appeal for urgent blood donations for a critically ill puppy. Ratan Tata, 86, rose to prominence at the helm of the Mumbai-based conglomerate the Tata Group, where in 2008 he famously oversaw Tata Motors\u2019 purchase of British car brands\u00a0Jaguar\u00a0and\u00a0Land Rover\u00a0from Ford. He retired as chairman in 2012 and has since thrown himself into improving the lot of India\u2019s many stray animals. On Thursday, the multimillionaire took to Instagram to appeal for help for a young dog being cared for at the Small Animal Hospital Mumbai, which was set up by Tata himself and opened earlier this year. The post featured a picture of the sick pup, with an IV drip in its front left leg, covered by a blue bandage. Tata, who has 9.7 million Instagram followers, wrote: \u201cI would really really appreciate your help. \u201cThis 7 month dog at our animal hospital needs urgent blood transfusion. He is admitted for a suspected tick fever and life threatening anaemia.\u201d Tata, who tagged the hospital in the post, did not identify the dog by name or sex. However, he did go on to detail the requirements for potential blood donors. Eligible dogs would need to be clinically healthy, aged between 1 and 8 years old, weighing at least 25 kilograms (55 pounds), fully vaccinated and with a clean bill of health. His efforts quickly proved successful, as Tata wrote in a later post that same day: \u201cI would like to thank the spirit of Mumbai and Casper, Leo, Scooby, Ronny and Ivan for coming forward to donate blood for the patient in crisis. We have a cross match on one of you and hope that the recovery will be quick.\u201d According to its website, the new veterinary hospital features \u201cevery possible diagnostic and treatment specialty.\u201d It states: \u201cThe city of Mumbai and its small companion animals have long awaited a one-stop healthcare facility where no stone is left unturned to treat your valued family member. At the Tata Trusts, we have recognised this plea.\u201d In a phone call with CNN, Sandeep Palav on the hospital\u2019s front desk, said: \u201cThe post was put out yesterday and the response was very encouraging. We got the blood donor yesterday and the puppy is now on the way to recovering.\u201d It is unclear whether the dog has an owner or is a stray. Last year, the Press Trust of India estimated there were around 62 million stray dogs in the country, although experts say the real number would be nearly impossible to verify. It is an issue that Tata has previously spoken out about. In an Instagram post last year, he expressed concern for the safety of stray cats and dogs that shelter under cars during the monsoon season. In 2019, Tata posted a picture of himself holding the paw of a German shepherd dog. He wrote: \u201cToday would be the 14th birthday of my late dog, Tito. I still come home to two kind souls and meet so many others in and around the office. While few have the comfort of families, many struggle on the streets, and yet somehow, their affection remains the same.

The cause of the crash remains unclear and investigation is ongoing, according to the emergency services. Those who died are believed to have been on the bus. Slovak national railway company ZSSK said on a statement on Facebook that none of the more than 100 passengers on the EuroCity train died as it sent its condolences to \u201cthe families and loved ones of the bus passengers who were injured or lost in this accident.\u201d The emergency response continued into the night at the crash site in Nov\u00e9 Z\u00e1mky, southern\u00a0Slovakia, the Slovak Emergency Medical Service said. Five ambulance vehicles and three ambulance helicopters are on the scene. Reuters footage from the scene showed smoke and fire billowing from a train carriage, with a person in the background heard saying: \u201cThere was just a big bang. Then the train stopped. We were able to get off, but the whole front part of the train was burning.\u201d The train was traveling from the Czech capital of Prague to the Hungarian capital of Budapest. More than 100 of its stranded passengers were transported by buses to the town of Sturovo on the Hungarian border. The locomotive and the driver of the train belonged to the Czech national railway company, while the carriages and the rest of the train staff were Slovak. The crash on Thursday was a second deadly collision involving an international train in the region in just three weeks. Four people were killed and more than 20 others injured on June 6 when a passenger\u00a0train\u00a0collided with a freight\u00a0train\u00a0in Pardubice in the\u00a0Czech\u00a0Republic. \u201cAll passengers were evacuated from the scene with the assistance of our staff.

{"id": "2024_07_01_style_jesus-ai-artificial-intelligence-social-media-cec", "text": "AI images have become an unavoidable roadside attraction on Facebook and other social media, where dramatic and outlandish depictions of emotional scenes lure users into doling out likes, shares and \u201cAmens.\u201d Among the funhouse images of fake children crying in the street and police officers saving inexplicably huge Bibles from the rain, countless depictions of Jesus Christ seem to take up an outsized amount of AI real estate. It makes sense. The central figure of Christianity invokes potent reactions from billions of followers around the globe. For the last 2,000 years, faithful hands have labored to create likenesses of their professed savior, projecting onto him various theologies and mythologies combined with aesthetics of the time: Jesus suffering on the cross, Jesus as the Good Shepherd, Jesus the creator of miracles, Jesus the word made flesh, Jesus as cosmic judge. Now, in the age of AI, Jesus can assume an infinite variety of roles with just a few keystrokes. Jesus as a durian fruit, for instance. Or Jesus battling shirtless with Satan. Sometimes, Jesus is cuddling a person in need in a hospital bed, his chiseled features and strong hands providing divine comfort. None of these things are in the Bible, but they are alive in the minds of particularly imaginative Christians, or just those who want some easy engagement on Facebook. What\u2019s unsettling is how many AI-created images of Jesus are unnecessarily handsome and rugged, like one of those Instagram influencers who wears a lot of pendants and is always wandering barefoot through an island jungle. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that, per se. The Bible doesn\u2019t get specific about Jesus\u2019 looks, and certainly artists over the millennia have taken creative license when it comes to his physique (and, to a different point, his skin tone). However, generative AI, like the kind that can create images from text prompts, doesn\u2019t work like an artist\u2019s brain. All of these handsome AI Jesus images are created from patterns a machine picks up from the information it is fed. What does that say about us, and how we view the figures most important to our cultural identities? The aesthetics of religious figures Since programs that generate AI art are trained on existing forms of art and imagery, the conundrum of handsome AI Jesus has two parts: How Jesus has been depicted in the images fed to such machines, and how the machines interpret the images they are given in order to spit out new ones. We\u2019ll start with the historical part first. \u201cDepicting religious figures in an idealized form far predates Christianity,\u201d says art historian and former classics professor Brenda Sanderson. \u201cGreeks and Romans portrayed their gods in a way that depicted strength and good health. While certain images of Jesus may not be intended to be sexual, they reflect a formal ideal that corresponds with the spiritual ideal.\u201d Sanderson also says some of these depictions merely reflect the sensibilities of the artist. The Sistine Chapel ceiling, painted by Michelangelo between 1508 and 1512, is considered one of the crowning achievements of sacred art. While its vibrant frescoes illustrate saints, prophets and characters of the Bible, it also includes a full-on depiction of God\u2019s bare behind. \u201cThings like that that some may consider sacreligious today weren\u2019t quite as scandalous at the time,\u201d she says. The question of whether a religious depiction is \u201ctoo sexy\u201d doesn\u2019t stop with Jesus. A very famous pair of sculptures created for St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral in Li\u00e8ge, Belgium in the 1800s has become a beloved part of art history lore. The first, \u201cL\u2019ange du mal,\u201d was created by artist Joseph Geefs, but was removed from the church because church officials worried about its effect on female worshipers and reportedly said, \u201cthe devil is too sublime.\u201d It was replaced by a different sculpture by Geefs\u2019 brother, Guillaume. However, in a humorous twist, many art lovers consider \u201cLe g\u00e9nie du mal\u201d to be even more suggestive than the original. Even today, the question of sexualized religious images in art is alive and well. In early 2024, a \u201csexualized\u201d painting of Jesus by Spanish artist Salustiano Garc\u00eda Cruz was decried as \u201coffensive\u201d and \u201cevil\u201d by critics. \u201cBiblical figures and saints have often been made attractive or \u2018sexy\u2019 in art history, whether it\u2019s images of the scantily-clad young Saint Sebastian pierced by arrows, the naked body of Mary Magdalene covered only by her hair, or the muscular torso of Christ in works by Michelangelo and others,\u201d art historian Morgan Haigh told the BBC about Garc\u00eda\u2019s work. How AI interprets art Now that we know there is a long history of humans depicting their religious figures in, well, idealized form, the prevalence of handsome AI Jesus makes more sense. Christopher Framer, a generative AI certified programmer from Petaluma, California, explains that different AI models are trained on different pieces of art, and the outcome relies on a person\u2019s input as well. \u201cFrom a consumer view you can\u2019t usually tell what kind of images an AI model has been fed, but what is generated can vary on other specifications like image type \u2014 does the person specify they want a photorealistic image? You see a lot of those on Facebook.\u201d Framer says other inputs can greatly vary the images, like the addition of words like \u201cstrong,\u201d \u201cfighting,\u201d or \u201cpower.\u201d \u201cI couldn\u2019t tell you for sure, but when people are looking to create images that elicit a specific response, they just need to add a single word or describe a situation, and that can create a huge difference.\u201d That\u2019s one reason why some depictions of AI Jesus include curious details, like tattoos, bulging biceps, hairy chests or soulful dreamboat eyes. \u201cThese programs don\u2019t actually know who Jesus is, or what he means. They know, through what they\u2019ve been fed, that most images of Jesus may look a certain way. Adding more into a prompt introduces more information into the image that may be at odds with what people think a religious image should look like.\u201d AI-generated images are becoming somewhat of a problem on social media, where engaging with a religious picture may take half a second and doesn\u2019t necessitate a close look at the content. Many AI photos of Jesus online also include elements of patriotism or politics, which, through Framer\u2019s explanation, alter the nature of the depiction. There are other complications that lead to the persistence of handsome AI Jesus. Some AI art experts fear the more AI images that are created, the more the programs that run them will create a kind of \u201cfeedback loop,\u201d where the same type of images get generated over and over again. These images attract thousands of likes and comments as people scroll by them, despite, at times, being very obviously manipulated. Many pages offering this kind of content also contain links to questionable websites, spam-like hashtags or repeated variations of the same type of image. All in all, it\u2019s not a very human experience. It makes sense that their posted images of Jesus feel a little inhuman, too.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/style/jesus-ai-artificial-intelligence-social-media-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_28_weather_tropical-depression-storm-beryl-hurricane", "text": "Beryl is the first hurricane of the 2024 Atlantic season, with maximum sustained winds of\u00a075 mph\u00a0with stronger gusts, according to a 5 p.m. EST update from the National Hurricane Center. The hurricane is located about 720\u00a0miles\u00a0east-southeast of Barbados, moving\u00a0west\u00a0at\u00a022\u00a0mph, and is expected to continue to strengthen before reaching the Windwards Islands early Monday. Beryl is now the first rapidly intensifying storm of the year, having accelerated from\u00a035\u00a0mph to\u00a075\u00a0mph in less than 24 hours. Rapid intensification is defined as a wind increase of 30 knots (35 mph) or more in a 24 hour period. The center warned earlier on Saturday that the storm was likely to develop into a \u201cdangerous major hurricane\u201d as it approaches the Windward Islands Sunday night or Monday. It brings a risk of heavy rainfall, hurricane-force winds and dangerous storm surge and waves to the central and western Caribbean. \u201cBeryl is expected to rapidly strengthen and be a major hurricane when it reaches the Windward Islands late Sunday night or Monday, bringing destructive hurricane-force winds and life-threatening storm surge,\u201d warns the center. The hurricane\u2019s early arrival is unusual: the average date for the first hurricane is August 11. The storm has been intensified by exceptionally warm ocean temperatures, driven by planet-warming fossil fuel pollution. Beryl could lash parts of the Lesser Antilles \u2013 the arching chain of islands that form a broken barrier between the open Atlantic and the Caribbean Sea \u2013 by the end of the weekend. A hurricane warning is in effect for Barbados and hurricane watches have been issued for St Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and Grenada. Tropical storm watches have been issued for Martinique and Tobago. The storm is also worth monitoring for those with interests along the US and Mexico Gulf coasts, but it will take a few days to sort out exactly where it will go or how strong it will be. More clarity should come once it is in the Caribbean Sea early next week. It\u2019s rare for tropical systems to form and track east of the Lesser Antilles in June. That this formed so early in the season \u2013 and in this part of the Atlantic \u2013 is a sign of the hyperactive hurricane season to come, according to research from Phil Klotzbach, a hurricane expert and research scientist at Colorado State University. Normally, ocean temperatures aren\u2019t warm enough in this region in June and July to help tropical systems thrive. That\u2019s hardly the case this year, and one of the reasons behind record-high hurricane season forecasts over the past few months. Ocean temperatures remain close to the off-the-chart highs being set this time last year in the area where the storm is tracking through and are currently at levels more commonly found in August and September. \u201cBeryl has found an environment with very warm ocean waters for this time of year,\u201d Dr. Mike Brennan, director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s\u00a0National Hurricane Center, told CNN\u2019s\u00a0Fredricka Whitfield Saturday. \u201cThese are ocean waters you\u2019d normally see like in August or September, but now we\u2019re seeing them in late June,\u201d Brennan said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of opening up more of the deep tropical Atlantic for formation before we get to what would be the traditional peak of the hurricane season.\u201d  It\u2019s a small slice of a bigger problem. Ocean temperatures across the globe and the Atlantic were record warm for over a year, driven upward by planet-warming fossil fuel pollution and in part by El Ni\u00f1o. This system is not alone. There are two other areas being monitored by the National Hurricane Center for development, including one in the same area of the Atlantic where this system formed and another in the southwest Gulf of Mexico. Both have low odds of developing over the next week, but given the unusual early season action and favorable ocean temperatures, they will have to be watched closely. The NHC is forecasting above-normal activity this year with 17 to 25 named storms \u2013 eight to 13 hurricanes, as well as four to seven major hurricanes. \u201cThat\u2019s well above average,\u201d Brennan noted. Caribbean islands urge public to make preparations as hurricane gains strength As the hurricane continues to rapidly strengthen, countries likely to be affected are urging their residents to take precautionary measures. Officials in Barbados say the island is expected to feel the impact of the storm as early as late Sunday night. Its meteorological service is anticipating storm-force winds, 3 to 6 inches of rain, \u201chazardous\u201d marine conditions, and severe thunderstorms that may interrupt power utilities. \u201cAll the regular preparations that we do for a hurricane is in full swing,\u201d Minister of Home Affairs and Information Wilfred Abrahams said in a message to the public. \u201cWe have less than 48 hours until we expect to see the effects of this system impacting Barbados. Please use the time very wisely.\u201d In Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves warns that the storm could hit the islands by Monday morning as a Category 2 hurricane. The meteorological service forecasts sustained winds of 74 to 110 mph (119 to 177 kmh) or greater and rainfall of 4 to 6 inches. \u201cKingstown is going to be flooded once this hurricane is on track,\u201d Gonsalves said of the capital city. \u201cNormally, two inches of rain \u2013 sustained rain \u2013 in a relatively short period of time will flood the city. Four inches will undoubtedly flood the city.\u201d In Saint Lucia, the government warns that the storm could bring \u201cmoderate to heavy showers, thunderstorms, and gusty winds\u201d to the region. Prime Minister Philip J. Pierre is advising residents to make necessary preparations and review their family emergency plans. In Grenada, the National Disaster Management Agency is also urging residents to prepare by having disaster supplies kits, trimming overhanging trees and branches, clearing drains and knowing where their emergency shelters are located.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/28/weather/tropical-depression-storm-beryl-hurricane/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "world"}}

The attack is the second in the last three months after more than 130 people were killed at a concert hall near Moscow in a terrorist attack claimed by ISIS-K in March, and challenges President Vladimir Putin\u2019s self-declared reputation as a leader able to guarantee order across the vast, turbulent country. The uptick in violence comes as long-simmering ethnic tensions resurface, compounded both by drives to fill Russia\u2019s military ranks as Putin\u2019s war against Ukraine grinds on \u2013 and by the ongoing conflict in the Middle East.

Attackers \u201cset the building on fire using Molotov cocktails\u201d at the synagogue in Derbent while police and security guards were killed outside during the attack, the RJC. In the provincial capital Makhachkala, Russian state-news agency TASS reported that a church security guard was killed in a shootout at Svyato-Uspenskiy Sobor, and 19 people had locked themselves inside the premises amid an attack.\u00a0 An attack was also reported at a police traffic post in Makhachkala. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attacks, but law enforcement agencies told TASS that the attackers were \u201cadherents of an international terrorist organization.\u201d The Investigative Directorate of the Investigative Committee of Russia for the Republic of Dagestan said it had launched a terror investigation into the attacks under the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation. TASS reported Monday that five of the gunmen had been identified and that some of them were related to the leader of the Sergokalinsky district, which lies between Derbent and Makhachkala. It identified one of the men as former mixed martial arts fighter Gadzhimurad Kagirov. Kagirov had taken part in the attack on Derbent and was also a cousin of the head of the Sergokalinsky district, Magomed Omarov, it claimed. Omarov\u2019s son and nephew were also among the attackers, authorities alleged. Where is Dagestan? Dagestan lies in Russia\u2019s Caucasus region on the western shores of the Caspian Sea. The republic is in many ways a microcosm of Russia\u2019s diversity. The mountainous region is home to over 30 ethnic groups with distinct languages and it is a\u00a0majority Muslim\u00a0republic\u00a0that has historically been home to a variety of Islamic religious practices. It has a miniscule Jewish population \u2013 Judaism is one of Dagestan\u2019s long-established religions, practiced by\u00a0communities of the Mountain Jews, who speak a form of Persian \u2013 but after centuries of coexistence with Muslim neighbors, that population has\u00a0dwindled through emigration. The Caucasus were mostly subsumed into the Russian empire in the nineteenth century had a long history of resentment towards rule by Moscow, during Tsarist, Soviet and post-Soviet times. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, insurgents in neighboring Chechnya fought two separatist wars for independence \u2013 which Russia labeled terrorism and responded with tactics that left much of the capital Grozny in ruins. Putin then installed feared warlord Ramzan Kadyrov in Chechnya who has since ruled with an iron fist. In Dagestan, Russian security forces fought an\u00a0Islamist insurgency\u00a0in the mountainous region in the 2000s that spilled over from neighboring Chechnya, though attacks have become rarer in recent years. But contemporary events have put the historically restless region once more on edge. Religious and ethnic tensions in Russia Over 200 ethnic minority communities live in Russia, which spans eleven time zones and is home to some 144 million people. Some of these communities have been hit especially hard by Putin\u2019s war in Ukraine with ethnic minorities disproportionately mobilized to face the horror of Moscow\u2019s human wave tactics. Protests broke out in multiple ethnic minority regions in 2022 against Putin\u2019s mobilization orders, including in Dagestan. In one video CNN geolocated from the time, women in the capital Makhachkala could be seen pleading with police outside a theater. \u201cWhy are you taking our children? Who attacked who? It\u2019s Russia that attacked Ukraine,\u201d they could be heard saying in the video. Israel\u2019s war against Hamas following the brutal October 7 attacks has also sent tensions soaring across the world, fueled by daily images of the destruction in Gaza, including in the Caucasus. Putin has played a delicate international balancing act, putting himself forward as a potential mediator and calling for restraint on both sides \u2013 a position that has\u00a0won praise from Hamas. But that confidence was shaken later that month when antisemitic rioters stormed Dagestan\u2019s Makhachkala Uytash Airport where a flight from Israel arrived. At\u00a0least 20 people were injured and 60 people were detained in the chaotic clashes, according to local authorities.  Multiple videos on social media showed a crowd of people inside the airport and on the runway, some waving the Palestinian flag, others forcing their way through closed doors in the international terminal. Interreligious violence is something that Russian leader Putin is \u201cvery, very worried\u201d about, said former CNN Moscow bureau chief Jill Dougherty in response to Sunday\u2019s attacks in Dagestan. Russia has a complex web of relationships in the Middle East: Putin backs Syrian President Bashar al-Assad (an enemy of Israel);\u00a0he relies on Iran\u00a0(another enemy of Israel) for a stockpile of drones to attack Ukraine; and he\u2019s a\u00a0high-fiving friend\u00a0of\u00a0Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, another power player in the region. He has also maintained cordial working relationships with Israeli counterparts, although\u00a0his relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has cooled. ISIS-K attack on music venue The coordinated attacks in Dagestan come just weeks after Russia suffered its worst terror attack in decades. In March, over 130 people were killed after assailants stormed a popular concert venue complex on the outskirts of Moscow. ISIS-K claimed responsibility for the massacre and four gunmen from the former Soviet republic of Tajikistan were charged with terrorism. The shocking terror attack came just a week after Putin won a stage-managed election which tightened his grip on the country he has ruled since the turn of the century. For a leader who has long promised security and stability to Russians, the major attack on Russian soil was another powerful blow. The emotion unleashed by the rampage \u2013 combined with the disturbing videos \u2013 unleashed a wave of xenophobia from some towards Central Asian migrant workers in general. Migrants from the former Soviet Union\u2019s Central Asian states \u2014 Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan \u2014 have traditionally been a valuable source of cheap labor in Russia. In the aftermath of the March attack, Putin called for Russia to remain united. \u201cWe must never forget that we are a multinational, multi-religious country. We must always treat our brothers, representatives of other faiths with respect, as we always do \u2014 Muslims, Jews, everyone,\u201d he said. But Sunday\u2019s attack in Dagestan shows deep fissures continue to pockmark Russia\u2019s border regions.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/europe/russia-dagestan-attacks-explainer-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "world"}}

Three of the sketches were made when the British queen, who reigned from 1837 until her death in 1901, was still a princess and only 14 years old.\u00a0Dated July 1833, they each depict a different figure on horseback \u2013\u00a0a knight, a woman, and a veiled woman. The fourth drawing is from 1838, one year after Victoria ascended the throne. It shows a seated woman with a crown and sash \u2013\u00a0not unlike her in appearance \u2013 and is inscribed \u201cby Her Majesty.\u201d \u201cThese slightly early drawings show that maybe she was still learning a lot, that she was still honing her craft,\u201d explained Charlotte Russell, Head of Sale for Old Master, British and European Pictures at Roseberys, the London-based auction house facilitating the sale on July 9. \u201cShe was very curious and keen as an artist,\u201d Russell told CNN. Roseberys has set an estimated sale price of \u00a31,500 to \u00a32,500 ($1,900 to $3,170) for the Victorian album that contains the four sketches, as well as works by other artists and items of royal ephemera. Russell says the album was probably assembled by Augusta Hayter, daughter-in-law of George Hayter, who painted the Queen\u2019s coronation portrait and was her court painter for many years. George Hayter also gave the Queen drawing lessons, and Russell believes these drawings show his influence \u201cquite closely\u201d. The album also features royal ephemera, including an invitation to the coronation of King George IV at Westminster Abbey in 1821. \u201cI\u2019m interested to see how it performs,\u201d said Russell. The auction house has previously sold other works by royal artists, including a painting by Queen Victoria\u2019s daughter, Princess Victoria, which fetched \u00a34,198 (around $5,320) last year. Art was one of Victoria\u2019s great loves \u2013\u00a0a passion she shared with her husband, Prince Albert. As newlyweds, the couple learned to etch together and would occasionally give their creations to family and friends. The Royal Collection Trust, which looks after the royal family\u2019s art collection, has more than 4,000 works by Queen Victoria, spanning 64 years of her life. The queen was a \u201ctalented\u201d and \u201cprolific\u201d artist, according to the trust. She received her first drawing lesson when she was eight years old and went on to be tutored by renowned artists like Edwin Landseer, William Leighton Leitch and Franz Xaver Winterhalter. She often drew from what she observed around her \u2013\u00a0nature, domestic life, people she encountered on her travels. \u201cShe is known to have experimented quite a lot with different subjects,\u201d said Russell, who added that Victoria would make \u201clittle sketches of costumes of people in the areas\u201d where she traveled. Last year, two paintings by the queen depicting vases of flowers were found in an English cottage and sold for \u00a319,500 (around $25,000).", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/style/queen-victoria-drawings-auction-sale-intl-scli-gbr/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_01_sport_portugal-slovenia-ronaldo-last-16-euro-2024-spt-intl", "text": "Portugal advanced to the quarterfinals of Euro 2024 after beating Slovenia in a penalty shootout on Monday in a game where Cristiano Ronaldo was reduced to tears after missing a spot-kick in extra-time. Ronaldo had his penalty superbly saved by Jan Oblak after a frustrating evening for the striker. His failure to convert his penalty left the 39-year-old in tears and his teammates had to rally round the striker before the second period of extra-time. In the shootout, Ronaldo stepped up and made amends by scoring his team\u2019s first penalty while Portugal goalkeeper Diogo Costa saved all three of Slovenia\u2019s attempts. Costa is the first keeper to save three penalties at a European Championships. Portugal scored all four of their penalties with Bernardo Silva slotting home the fourth to confirm the victory. Costa had kept Portugal in the game during extra-time when he expertly saved from Slovenia\u2019s superstar youngster Benjamin \u0160e\u0161ko after the 21-year-old had pounced on a rare mistake from 41-year-old Pepe to run clear. Costa stuck out a leg to stop \u0160e\u0161ko from scoring and the game went to that penalty shootout. Portugal will now play France on July 5. A frustrating evening ends well Before Costa\u2019s goalkeeping masterclass, it had looked like it was going to be a frustrating evening for Portugal and Ronaldo personally. Having entered Monday\u2019s game without a goal at Euro 2024, it was more of the same at the Frankfurt Arena for Ronaldo. He had opportunities to score with his head, while as ever he also was on freekick duty for Portugal. He hit some of his efforts over the bar and another straight at Oblak. Ronaldo\u2019s best opportunity during normal time came in the final few minutes when he was played in on goal but his left-footed shot was straight at Oblak. As the game dragged on, Ronaldo cut an increasingly disheartened character. That was until the end of the first period of extra-time when his teammate Diogo Jota was felled in the Slovenia box and a penalty was awarded. Ronaldo, as the team\u2019s designated penalty taker, stepped up but Oblak was able to get a big hand to it, tipping it onto the post and away to safety. The frustrations of the moment clearly impacted Ronaldo and he was seen in tears during the extra-time interval as his teammates attempted to console him and get him in the right frame of mind for the rest of the match. Costa\u2019s huge save to deny \u0160e\u0161ko was the only major moment of the final 15 minutes of action before the penalty shootout, which was the first of the tournament. He saved all three Slovenian penalties while Ronaldo banished his demons by powering home his own attempt; after scoring, he raised a seemingly apologetic hand to the Portugal supporters behind the goal. Ronaldo has already made history at Euro 2024 by becoming the first player to feature in six European Championships, but he has lacked his usual cutting edge in this edition of the tournament. The veteran striker, who plays for Saudi Arabian club Al-Nassr, has now gone seven games at major international tournaments with Portugal without scoring. Given he\u2019s scored a world record 130 goals, his recent inability to find the net is something of a surprise, but also raises question as to whether he should be a seemingly permanent fixture in the team. The 39-year-old made his European Championship debut back in 2004, when host Portugal was beaten by Greece in the final. Ronaldo went on to lead his nation to victory at Euro 2016, his only major trophy at international level, though he had to be substituted in the first half of the final after picking up an injury. The former Manchester United, Real Madrid and Juventus star featured in all of Portugal\u2019s Group F matches this year, without finding the net. The frustration of his inability to score on Monday appeared to be getting to Ronaldo and he could often be seen shouting to the heavens on several occasions when a chance went begging. Monday\u2019s game was a familiar story for Ronaldo to the rest of his Euro 2024, as he has yet to find the back of the net so far at the tournament. According to Goal, it was the first time he had finished a group stage without a goal. He has had also the most shots of any player in his four games at Euro 2024 \u2013 20 \u2013 with no goals to his name. Nonetheless, Friday\u2019s quarterfinal against France offers Ronaldo the chance to become the oldest goalscorer at the Euros should he find the net. Meanwhile Ronaldo\u2019s teammate Pepe, who is 41 years and 126 days old, made history on Monday by becoming the oldest player to appear in a knockout stage match in major tournaments surpassing the previous record set by former England goalkeeper Peter Shilton, per Opta.

{"id": "2024_06_26_africa_kenyan-president-rejects-finance-bill-intl", "text": "Kenyan President William Ruto said Wednesday that he will not sign a controversial finance bill, backing down in the face of mass protests that swept the country and reportedly left at least 23 people dead. \u201cHaving reflected on the continuing conversation regarding the content of the finance bill 2024, and listening keenly to the people of Kenya who have said loudly that they want nothing to do with this Finance Bill 2024, I concede, and therefore I will not sign the 2024 finance bill,\u201d Ruto said during a television address Wednesday. \u201cThe people have spoken,\u201d Ruto said. \u201cFollowing the passage of the bill, the country experienced widespread expression of dissatisfaction with the bill as passed, regrettably resulting in the loss of life, the destruction of property and desecration of constitutional institutions.\u201d Protesters in Kenya say they will go ahead with a \u201cOne Million People March\u201d on Thursday despite Ruto accepting their key demand of scrapping the bill. A\u00a0poster shared widely\u00a0on social media calls on all generations to return to the streets across the country on Thursday and block roads leading to the capital Nairobi. Some protesters have also called for people to occupy the State House in Nairobi. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has spoken with Ruto since the clashes to urge restraint. According to a State Department readout of their call, Blinken \u201cunderscored the importance of security forces demonstrating restraint and refraining from violence and encouraged prompt investigations into allegations of human rights abuses.\u201d Kenya, a nation often praised for its stability, had seen escalating protests over the bill, which the government introduced to rein in public debt. Last week, the government\u00a0scrapped\u00a0some tax increases, including a proposed 16% value-added tax on bread along with taxes on motor vehicles, vegetable oil and mobile money transfers. But the concessions were not enough to quell protests amid the\u00a0rising cost of living. On Tuesday they turned deadly when security forces fired teargas and live ammunition at protesters. Dramatic scenes in the nation\u2019s capital Nairobi saw government buildings set on fire and a ceremonial mace stolen from the parliament in the melee. Kenyan lawmakers were evacuated from the parliament as police went up against protesters, CNN affiliate NTV Kenya reported. At least 23 people died in the violence, according to Kenya\u2019s Police Reforms Working Group, (PRWG) a civil society organization. The PRWG alleged in a statement published by Amnesty International Kenya that police targeted young, unarmed protesters outside the parliament, with the violence continuing into the night. They added that \u201creports show police shot several people in Githurai, Nairobi, one over 40 times \u2014 between 10 p.m. and 1 a.m., way after the protest ended.\u201d This was in contrast to details given by Ruto, who said in his speech that six people died. \u201cI send my condolences to the families of those who lost their loved ones in this very unfortunate manner,\u201d Ruto added. \u201cThere is need for us as a nation to pick up from here and go into the future,\u201d Ruto said, adding that he would hold an engagement with the young people at the forefront of the protests to hear their ideas and proposals. The Law Society of Kenya is calling for the resignation of Kenya\u2019s inspector general of police and the Nairobi regional commander over officers allegedly shooting protesters. \u201cWe saw plainclothes policemen shooting protesters as early as 11 a.m. There was a clear directive to kill protesters,\u201d Law Society of Kenya president Faith Odhiambo alleged in an interview with CNN on Wednesday evening. \u201cThere was no intent to let the protesters move around.\u201d The Law Society also said the police \u201cabducted\u201d several prominent social media users connected to the protests, and six people remain missing. \u201cThe reports from those who have been freed is that they were taken blindfolded and handcuffed, and they didn\u2019t know where they were,\u201d she told CNN, after the society secured the release of six people. \u201cEven after they come out, most of them are quite shaken and afraid and want to go into hiding. Our message to the government is that if a country is built on fear, one day people will stop fearing. And that\u2019s what we saw on Tuesday.\u201d Ruto\u2019s change of heart came as a surprise to some who observed his hardline stance just a day earlier. During a nationwide address after the parliament was set alight, Ruto said the events on Tuesday were a grave threat to \u201cnational security\u201d and that the conversation around the bill had been \u201chijacked by dangerous people.\u201d Kenyan analyst Herman Manyora said withdrawing the bill much earlier could have saved the lives lost on Tuesday. \u201cHis announcement should have come earlier. He has done today what he should have done two days ago to avoid what we went through yesterday. It pains me that we had to wait \u2026 for us to do what we should have done on Monday \u2026 and that\u2019s a general feeling among people,\u201d Manyora told CNN.

{"id": "2024_06_28_middleeast_iran-presidential-election-june-28-mime-intl", "text": "Under the specter of conflict with Israel, a struggling economy and social discontent, Iranians headed to the polls on Friday for snap presidential elections that could be the most important for the country in decades. The sudden death of President Ebrahim Raisi in a recent helicopter crash, alongside Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian and other officials, has left a leadership void. Raisi, a hardline regime loyalist, was widely regarded as a leading candidate to replace Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader, 85-year-old Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who holds ultimate authority over all state matters. It is also the first presidential election since the death of Mahsa Amini in the custody of the country\u2019s notorious morality police in 2022, an event that sparked the largest protests since the regime\u2019s founding in 1979. The vote takes place amid deteriorating relations with the West, an advancing Iranian nuclear program, and an increasing risk of direct war with Israel. Just two months ago, Iran and Israel exchanged fire for the first time as the Gaza conflict widened, and Israel is now preparing for a potential second front with Hezbollah, Iran\u2019s primary regional proxy, in Lebanon. Three conservatives are vying with a single reformist candidate for the country\u2019s top elected seat, after dozens of other candidates were barred from standing. Of those running, Masoud Pezeshkian, 69, a reformist lawmaker and former health minister, Saeed Jalili a hardline security adviser and nuclear negotiator, and Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, the conservative speaker of the Iranian parliament, are widely considered the frontrunners in the first round of elections. The final candidates were pre-selected by Iran\u2019s Guardian Council, which reports directly to Khamenei. Some polls have shown increasing popularity for Pezeshkian, with the rest of the conservatives splitting the vote. During nationwide protests against Amini\u2019s death in 2022, Pezeshkian said in an interview with Iran\u2019s IRINN TV: \u201cIt is our fault. We want to implement religious faith through the use of force. This is scientifically impossible.\u201d On Thursday, two conservative candidates, Amirhossein Qazizadeh-Hashemi and Alireza Zakani, withdrew from the race to help consolidate the hardline vote. Qazizadeh-Hashemi urged other candidates from the \u201crevolution camp\u201d to do the same to secure a hardliner victory. Any candidate who wins at least 50% of votes in the first round will be elected president, otherwise the two top-ranking candidates will face off in a second round a week later. \u201cThese are nothing like free and fair elections, and only those who\u2019ve already pledged absolute loyalty to Khamenei and the Islamic Republic can run,\u201d said Arash Azizi, an Iranian writer and fellow at the Center for Middle East and Global Order (CMEG), a Berlin-based think tank. \u201cBut there are still very important differences between the three main candidates. Each of them present certain problems for Khamenei.\u201d The top contenders are children of Iran\u2019s 1979 Islamic Revolution, likely shaped by their experiences fighting the then US-backed Saddam Hussein regime in the bloody, decade-long war with their neighbor Iraq, as well as careers serving the Iranian state. \u00a0\u00a0But voters\u2019 choice between either of the conservatives or their reformist co-candidate will steer a different path forward for the country. \u201cWhat we have seen in this election compared to (the) previous one (in 2021), is that in the last couple of days there has been a degree of energy for the election,\u201d said Trita Parsi, a Washington-based Iran analyst and executive vice president of the Quincy Institute, suggesting the participation rate may end up being higher than previous elections. The Iranian electoral process has been marred by voter apathy of late, causing embarrassment to an establishment that has relied on high voter turnout to bolster its democratic credentials and popular legitimacy. Elections in March for the parliament and the Assembly of Experts, an oversight body responsible for selecting the Supreme Leader\u2019s successor, recorded the lowest turnout since the Islamic Republic\u2019s founding, despite government efforts to rally voters ahead of the ballot. Khamenei urged Iranians to head to the polls and vote after he cast his ballot in the election on Friday morning. \u201cPeople\u2019s participation is part of the essence of the state and continuation of the existence of the Islamic Republic and its status in the world is tied to people\u2019s participation\u201d, he said. Despite some momentum, however, low voter turnout \u201cremains a distinct possibility, fueled by widespread disillusionment and economic hardships,\u201d said Sina Toossi, an Iran analyst and senior fellow at the Center for International Policy in Washington, DC. \u201cMany Iranians feel disenfranchised and skeptical about the electoral process, doubting its ability to bring about meaningful change, particularly in light of the government\u2019s violent repression of popular protests in recent years,\u201d he said. \u201cA substantial number of Iranians say they will boycott the elections, including prominent civil society activists and political prisoners like Nobel Laureate Narges Mohammadi.\u201d \u2018Iranians need simple things\u2019 At Shiroudi stadium in Tehran, there was an ebullient atmosphere Wednesday as supporters of the conservative Ghalibaf gathered for his final campaign rally. Several thousand Iranians crammed into the indoor arena, mobbing the candidate as he entered, chanting: \u201cWe salute Raisi, we say hello to Ghalibaf.\u201d \u201cGhalibaf is the one who supports the Supreme Leader and follows him. Whatever the Supreme Leader says, he puts into practice,\u201d Ahmad, 32, a clerical official, said in the crowd. Iranians who spoke to CNN only agreed to give their first names in order to be able to speak candidly. Economic concerns are foremost on the minds of many voters. In June, inflation in Iran stood at 36.1%, straining wallets across the country. Although down from highs exceeding 45% last year, the country\u2019s annual inflation rate hasn\u2019t dipped below 30% in over five years. This persistent inflation follows the Trump administration\u2019s withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear agreement and the subsequent reimposition of heavy sanctions on the Islamic Republic. Ghalibaf has been determined in his attacks on the 2015 nuclear deal and paths towards rapprochement with the West, pinning much of the country\u2019s economic woes on Iran\u2019s Western enemies. \u201cThe first thing people expect is economic development. There is no doubt that this development can happen through the path of elections,\u201d Ghalibaf shouted to the crowd, echoing promises from his campaign. Draped along the walls were campaign pledges of food on the table of all Iranian households and free land for homeless families. \u201cIt worries me when people run after candidates like Ghalibaf,\u201d one university worker told CNN outside the rally. Leaning towards voting for Pezeshkian, the only reformist candidate, she said she had come to Ghalibaf\u2019s rally to hear him speak before deciding who to vote for. \u201cIranians need simple things, a good economy, good relations with other countries,\u201d she said, adding that she trusted Pezeshkian to deliver on them. \u2018A small window of hope\u2019 As night fell at the nearby Heidarnia stadium, supporters of Pezeshkian gathered to hear him speak, with many focused on improving Iran\u2019s international relations. \u201cThe change we need in politics is foreign policy so it will result in improvements in people\u2019s economic situation,\u201d Mariam, 23, told CNN. She added that voting for a conservative would be a repeat of the late President Raisi, whom she criticized for failing to fulfill his promises, and for not reining in Iran\u2019s infamous morality police. Around her, the crowd was on edge, an urgent energy rippled across the stadium. An hour before, organizers abruptly announced the event had been cancelled, and police blocked the gate. Despondent supporters poured into nearby streets; their chants, like the mood, were resolute: \u201cOur vote is one word: Pezeshkian.\u201d Cheers surged through the crowd of several thousand Pezeshkian supporters when they were later allowed into the stadium but the incident in the final hours of his campaign stung his assembled voters. \u201cWe only have a small window of hope, which is Pezeshkian,\u201d Mohammad, 47, a journalist, told CNN at the rally. \u201cWe cannot change the constitution \u2026 we should move forwards step by step, until we reach the democracy that people are seeking.\u201d Parsi, the Iran expert, suggested that enthusiasm for this vote may stem from it being a snap election. \u201cNo one expected this to happen,\u201d he said, noting that Raisi\u2019s unexpected death might be creating a public perception that \u201cperhaps the regime doesn\u2019t have the capability of controlling this election,\u201d as it has in the past. Relations with the West Iran\u2019s foreign policy direction is largely steered by Khamenei, and the president\u2019s role is principally domestic. However, the future president and his foreign minister will play a crucial role in the working relations with the international community. \u201cPezeshkian\u2019s victory won\u2019t be bad news for Khamenei and, in fact, might even be the best outcome since he will be a weak president with a smaller base and thus easier to control,\u201d said Azizi. Pezeshkian\u2019s key ally is former Foreign Minister Javad Zarif. If the US-educated Zarif, who oversaw the warmest recent period of ties with Washington, returns in an official capacity, he may provide a conduit for an easing of tensions with the West. However, this week Khamenei condemned those chasing improved relations with the West - in an apparent implicit attack on Pezeshkian and Zarif.

{"id": "2024_07_01_style_first-lady-jill-biden-vogue-cover-2024", "text": "First lady Dr. Jill Biden is Vogue\u2019s August cover star just as election season is kicking off in earnest in the United States \u2014 and only days after President Joe Biden\u2019s shaky first debate performance rattled the Democratic party. On the cover \u2014 her second for the fashion magazine \u2014 Dr. Biden appears in a cream-colored Ralph Lauren silk tuxedo dress, lensed by the veteran fashion photographer Norman Jean Roy. The accompanying profile, by Maya Singer, was written pre-debate, as the Vogue writer shadowed FLOTUS during two April campaign stops in Minnesota: one to speak to the coalition Women for Biden-Harris in Minneapolis, and another to speak to Educators for Biden-Harris. \u201cWe are the first generation in half a century to give our daughters a country with fewer rights than we had,\u201d she said in her speech at the first event, according to Vogue. \u201cBook bans. Voting laws gutted. Court decisions that strip away our most basic freedoms. But circumstance is not destiny. \u2026 When our bodies are on the line, when our daughters\u2019 futures are at stake, when our country and its freedom hang in the balance, we are immovable and unstoppable.\u201d Following the first presidential debate by President Biden and former President Trump, which was moderated by CNN on June 27, Biden advisers told CNN that his family continued their steadfast support in his bid for reelection. Vogue, too, reached out to the first lady following the debate amid calls for the president to step down as the Democratic nominee. She told the magazine that they \u201cwill not let those 90 minutes define the four years he\u2019s been president. We will continue to fight.\u201d Over those past four years, Biden has stepped into her role as FLOTUS with a hands-on approach. Earlier this year, the White House announced her new, critical initiative to fund research into a range of women\u2019s health issues that have been vastly understudied, from endometriosis to heart disease. As an English professor at Northern Virginia Community College, she\u2019s been an advocate for increased funding for in-school help for students particularly as the Covid-19 pandemic strained school systems and left gaps in education. And, as she told Vogue, she\u2019s seen the career-related frustrations of military spouses due to the often transient nature of their lives, so she has supported flexibility for remote work for some government jobs. \u201cReally, in so many different areas, I tell him what I\u2019m seeing, what I\u2019m hearing, and he gets it,\u201d she said of her husband. \u201cAnd this is where the magic happens.\u201d The first lady\u2019s sleeves-rolled-up approach is often reflected in her wardrobe. She favors a polished but practical style, from power suits and classic trenches to clothes with simple messaging (like her embellished \u201clove\u201d jacket at the G7 summit that\u00a0drew\u00a0contrasts to her predecessor\u2019s infamous \u201cI really don\u2019t care, do u?\u201d fashion statement). She places emphasis on American designers, often wearing pieces by Sergio Hudson, Michael Kors and Ralph Lauren. Following up on the periwinkle blue suit she wore at the presidential debate, she wore a black dress with white lettering by Christian Siriano at a North Carolina rally the next morning meant to re-energize voters. Her choice of garment conveyed her point loud and clear: \u201cVote,\u201d it repeated all over. However the political path forward unfolds, the first lady is sure to be key to the president\u2019s decisions. In Vogue\u2019s cover story, political journalist and author Katie Rogers noted that Dr. Biden is often not counted as one of the president\u2019s key advisers, but that she\u2019s \u201chis gut check and closest confidant.\u201d In the interview, the first lady struck a hopeful chord, but warned against the polarization that has split the country. \u201cWe don\u2019t need more chaos,\u201d she said. \u201cFundamentally, Americans care about each other. And this anger and animosity and divisiveness\u2026 it\u2019s not who we are.

{"id": "2024_04_10_style_graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers", "text": "Climbing up abandoned, unfinished floors and tightrope walking across balcony ledges, backpacks clanging with cans of alkyd and acrylic, a collective of Los Angeles graffiti artists have transformed their craft beyond urban aesthetics to champion community issues. Their choice of canvas: Oceanwide Plaza in Downtown LA. Occupying over a full square city block, the plaza was imagined as a vast mixed-use building project, offering city residents over 500 lavish condominiums, a five-star hotel, retail spaces, restaurants and a private 2-acre park. However, construction on the $1 billion project, which began in 2015, was shelved after the Chinese-backed contractor Oceanwide Holdings ran out of funding\u00a0in 2019 \u2014 and it has lain unfinished ever since. The plaza\u2019s status \u2014 and potential \u2014 as an eye-catching venue for their work spread by word of mouth within the graffiti community in recent months. Security at the site was known to be lax, an important detail as accessing the plaza\u2019s towers and other buildings constitutes trespassing. (The Los Angeles City Attorney confirmed to CNN that, as of April 3, criminal charges have been filed against 23 individuals, for violations including trespassing and possession of vandalism tools.) \u201cIt was like a gift from the graffiti gods\u2026 A giant canvas in the middle of downtown,\u201d tagger ENDEM told CNN, speaking on behalf of himself and his graffiti crew, NCT. \u201cWe were like, \u2018Let\u2019s do it right. Let\u2019s do it as if the whole world is going to see this.\u2019\u201d Historically, graffiti has often been used as protest art. While the practice dates back thousands of years, it\u2019s most commonly viewed in a contemporary context (within graffiti\u2019s \u201cmodern\u201d era, which dates back to the 1960s and 70s) as a creative vehicle for challenging societal norms and inequities \u2014 whether on the Berlin Wall in Germany or subway cars in New York City; whether painted by anonymous artists or well-known figures like Keith Haring or Banksy, even if the latter is, technically, anonymous himself. Still, neither ENDEM nor any of the other artists involved realized how famous their work on the Oceanside towers would become. Sharing his artwork on Instagram on January 31, a video from ENDEM quickly racked up tens of thousands of views: Vibrant images of bright block lettering splayed across the building\u2019s exterior paired with footage from the inside \u2014 the artist posing with shots of his spray paint cans, poised above the cityscape. The viral footage, among other visuals shared on social media, quickly opened the floodgates. Hitting Oceanside became a mark of credibility in the graffiti world; by mid-February, the number of tags and other graffiti pieces there were multiplying overnight. \u201cIt was an open house people going in and out. It was beautiful. It was like graffiti paradise,\u201d ENDEM said. \u201cIt felt exactly like the streets, but concentrated.\u201d Transformed in part into an art installation, Oceanwide became an opportunity for the graffiti artists to leave a message to the city below, and a call-out to policy makers who leave buildings to rot. \u201cGraffiti shows you where the city hurts,\u201d Roger Gastman, owner and founder of the LA-based arts organization Beyond the Streets, told CNN. Renowned for its large-scale exhibitions, immersive educational programs, pop-up events and partnerships, Beyond the Streets works to educate and celebrate the diverse dimensions of graffiti as a medium. To him, the mission of graffiti is clear: to challenge, educate, and redefine public perception of the medium. Earl Ofari Hutchinson, president of The Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable, a nonpartisan public policy forum\u00a0for civic participation and education,\u00a0sees the abandoned towers as amplifying the social issues of the community they are situated in, connecting the graffiti-laden structures to the urban blight that surrounds them in LA\u2019s Skid Row. Skid Row is a 50-block sector of downtown LA where between 8,000 and 11,000 unhoused people live in challenging, often squalid conditions. \u201cYou\u2019ve got tens of thousands of people displaced because of over urban development. And as a result of that, they\u2019re on the streets,\u201d Hutchinson told CNN, noting that the homeless population in Los Angeles is continuing to grow. (The Los Angeles Housing Services Authority reports a 9% increase in homelessness in LA county in 2023 and a 10% increase in the city from 2022.) \u201cNow, set right in the middle of that, you have\u2026 a development that will never be completed.\u201d \u201cWhat you have here is a classic urban nightmare brought on by very poor policies \u2014 fiscal, financial, budgetary and political problems (in) a city that has just gone off the rails in terms of over-development and lack of affordability,\u201d Hutchinson added. Still, Hutchinson is no fan of the graffiti either. To him, and many other LA residents who have said they disapprove of the \u201cvandalism,\u201d the plaza is a sore sight for eyes. \u201cThe problem is you\u2019re talking about violating public space and with no permission\u2026 that doesn\u2019t fly with me,\u201d Hutchinson said. \u201cThe fact of the matter is, the public has not given you approval. (And) the general public has to pay for the removal.\u201d Costs currently borne by the taxpayer at the Oceanwide Plaza site include the security details provided by the LAPD as well as the graffiti cleanup Hutchinson highlights. (\u201cThis has strained our deployment,\u201d LAPD Chief Michel Moore said during a February meeting of the Los Angeles City Council. \u201cWe have called in some officers on an overtime basis so that we can provide for these added patrols or station them at that site to deter vandals and others from gaining access.\u201d) Clean teams working in the neighborhoods surrounding Oceanwide remove on average some 2,000 square feet of graffiti per week, with that figure growing in recent months. \u201cPeople forget that people live here. People own businesses here and they don\u2019t want to have to spend the time and money to clean it up,\u201d said Blair Besten, executive director of the Historic Core of Downtown Los Angeles, an organization which works to improve the quality of life in downtown neighborhoods. The Historic Core prioritizes street sweeping, trash collection \u2014 and graffiti removal. \u201cI would hardly call what they\u2019re doing art,\u201d Besten argued of the Oceanwide taggers. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty sloppy and quick. They come in fast and they knock it out and they leave.\u201d But to Gastman, graffiti is a powerful form of expression, and a call-to-action \u2014 particularly for those who emanate from struggles within home life, gang life or societal turmoil. Graffiti culture can offer an unexpected support system for those the city has abandoned, Gastman said. It becomes a platform for them to make their voices heard. \u201cIn graffiti culture, a lot of us know each other. We\u2019re all friends. We have the same mentality \u2014 we\u2019re just trying to get up. We\u2019re just trying to get noticed,\u201d explained ENDEM. In the midst of an addiction that led to his rock bottom, graffiti became his lifeline, he explained. \u201cI was at my lowest of lows, still trying to stay sober, I needed some type of outlet,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cGraffiti is something that you can hold on to. Its bigger than me, its everyone, it\u2019s a community.\u201d In this, ENDEM believes that the beauty of Oceanwide isn\u2019t tangible. Rather, it lies in the birth of a new generation of graffiti writers. \u201cThey can erase the graffiti on buildings, but they can never erase the impact that it has on the city of Los Angeles and the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to it. Yes, it\u2019s vandalism. Yes, it\u2019s art, and it\u2019s everything in between,\u201d Gastman concluded. \u201cThis is a real culture. It\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/10/style/graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_01_asia_north-korea-failed-missile-test-south-korea-intl-hnk-ml", "text": "A ballistic missile launched by North Korea on Monday might have had an \u201cabnormal\u201d flight trajectory and could have fallen inland, possibly near the capital of Pyongyang, the South Korean military said. North Korea launched two ballistic missiles on Monday morning, according to reports from the South Korean, American and Japanese governments. The missiles, launched at 5:05 a.m. and 5:15 a.m. local time, had two different flight distances, 600 kilometers (373 miles) for the first and 120 kilometers (75 miles) for the second, according to a statement from South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS). When asked about the disparate distances, Lee Sung-jun, spokesperson for the JCS, in a briefing said, \u201cThere is the possibility that the second launched missile had an abnormal flight in the early stage.\u201d \u201cIf it had exploded during an abnormal flight, there is the possibility that debris fell inland,\u201d Lee said, clarifying that an \u201cexplosion\u201d is one of many possibilities. The military is \u201ccomprehensively analyzing\u201d various possibilities. He added that no damage has been confirmed so far. South Korea said the first missile, with the 600-kilometer (373-mile) flight distance, was a short-range ballistic missile, but Lee would only say the second was \u201ca ballistic missile,\u201d which leaves open the possibility of it being a new weapon. According to JCS, the two missiles were launched northeastward from the Changyon-gun area of South Hwanghae province, about 130 kilometers (81 miles) southwest of Pyongyang. If the missile exploded after flying 120 kilometers (75 miles) northeastward from Changyon-gun, the debris could have landed near Pyongyang, based on the distance traveled from the launch site. The JCS could not confirm whether there was an explosion near the capital, which is North Korea\u2019s largest city and home to more than 3 million people. Last week, North Korea said it successfully conducted a\u00a0test to deploy multiple warheads from a single-stage engine for a medium- to long-range ballistic missile, marking an important milestone in upgrading its missile technology. South Korea later said the North Korean claim was false. Lee, the JCS spokesperson, said that during a successful test, multiple warheads should separate from a missile during the descending stage of its flight, but North Korea\u2019s missile had exploded in the early stage during launch. North Korea did not make any statements after Monday morning\u2019s launches, but on Sunday put out a statement on the state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) denouncing the recent US-South Korea-Japan military exercises named \u201cFreedom Edge,\u201d calling it another sign of the three partners \u201creckless and provocative military muscle-flexing.\u201d The statement said North Korea would \u201ccontinue to make important efforts to deter the acts of disturbing peace and stability\u201d on the Korean Peninsula. Technically the two Koreas\u00a0remain at war\u00a0\u2013 an armistice ended the Korean War that split the peninsula in 1953 but no formal peace treaty was ever signed. Relations between the two countries thawed somewhat in 2017 and 2018, but the situation in North Korea deteriorated in the following years as leader Kim ramped up weapons testing in defiance of United Nations sanctions and diplomatic talks fell apart. Meanwhile, both nations are drawing closer to their respective partners \u2013 with North Korea recently signing a defense agreement with Russian President Vladimir Putin\u00a0and South Korea stepping up cooperation with Japan and the United States. Leif-Eric Easley, professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul, said Monday\u2019s missile tests, which occurred during ongoing meetings of the Central Committee of the ruling Worker\u2019s Party, likely served two purposes for the Kim regime. \u201cIn both North Korean politics and military policy, the best defense is often a good offense. These missile launches are likely the Kim regime\u2019s way of compensating for recent failed tests, aiming to impress a domestic audience during ruling party meetings,\u201d he said. \u201cPyongyang is also determined not to appear weak while South Korea conducts defense exercises with Japan and the United States.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/asia/north-korea-failed-missile-test-south-korea-intl-hnk-ml/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "world"}}

Fresh protests dubbed \u201cOne Million People March\u201d began Thursday, with demonstrators calling for roads leading to the capital Nairobi to be blocked. Others threatened to occupy the State House, the president\u2019s office,\u00a0and the official residence. In a surprise move on Wednesday, Ruto said he would not sign the finance bill, saying he had been \u201clistening keenly\u201d to the Kenyan people. He had been facing escalating protests over the bill, with a civil society organization saying at least 23 people had died in clashes. But so far his move has failed to quell the demonstrations. Security forces have set up roadblocks around routes leading to the State House while other parts of the capital city have been fortified with heavy police presence. \u201cIt\u2019s more than about the finance bill now,\u201d Maria, a Kenyan protestor from Nairobi told CNN. \u201c(They\u2019re) killing us as young people for what? We come in peace,\u201d she added. Despite being billed as a \u2018million people march,\u2019 turnout was noticeably lower in Nairobi\u2019s central business district, a CNN team observed. The heavy security presence within the city deterred a crowd from forming with police shouting at protesters to \u201cgo home\u201d in Swahili. What the largely youthful protesters now want varies. Some have called on President Ruto to resign for failing to withdraw the unpopular bill much earlier to save the lives lost. Others are seeking justice for the deceased protesters and demanding the recall of lawmakers who voted in support of the finance bill. \u201cI want them to listen to me,\u201d another protester told CNN. Civic groups such as the Law Society of\u00a0Kenya\u00a0are calling for the removal of\u00a0Kenya\u2019s inspector general of police and Nairobi\u2019s regional police commander after officers were accused of reportedly shooting dead protesters. Kenya, East Africa\u2019s dominant economy, has grappled with escalating living costs that have spiked food prices and other commodities. The nation also owes billions of dollars in foreign and local debts, spending a sizeable chunk of its revenue repaying its creditors. \u201cI am not going to preside over a bankrupt country, I am not going to preside over a country that is in debt distress,\u201d President Ruto said last month while defending his plans. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) expressed concern about a \u201csignificant shortfall\u201d in Kenya\u2019s \u201ctax revenue collection\u201d while urging its government to consider measures to shore up its earnings to reduce borrowing. The bill proposed levies on locally produced products, such as diapers and sanitary towels, including taxes on motor vehicles, and\u00a0mobile money transfer fees, among others. Last week, Ruto shelved some of those taxes, but Kenyans remain angry, and called for the bill to\u00a0be\u00a0scrapped completely. International financial ratings\u00a0agency\u00a0Moody\u2019s warned that scrapping the bill \u201cwill create a revenue shortfall\u201d in Kenya\u2019s budgeting. Ruto warned of spending cuts across government financing if the tax measures were withdrawn. Ruto\u2019s leadership is now being tested like never before. His ability to navigate this period of unrest will be critical not only for his political survival but also for the stability of\u00a0Kenya. The ongoing protests suggest that mere policy reversals may not be sufficient. Analyst Herman Manyora, a lecturer at the University of Nairobi,\u00a0told CNN the\u00a0president\u00a0may need to engage in more substantial reforms to restore faith in his administration. \u201cThe way forward is for the president to go a little more than he has done now in order to get the goodwill of the people,\u201d Manyora said. \u201cHe needs to reshuffle his cabinet and economic advisers which will send a signal that will create the goodwill required. At that point, a government-led conversation can take place.\u201d Ruto, whose rise to the presidency was largely propelled by youth voters said in his address retracting the finance bill that he hoped to engage with young people in the country to listen to their ideas and proposals on how to solve the nation\u2019s economic challenges. But that won\u2019t come easy, Manyora said. \u201cThey (young people) feel betrayed.

Reports of the purported abuse quickly spread across social media, prompting outraged local residents to riot \u2014 setting fire to cars and Syrian-run businesses in the central Anatolian city. \u201cAn investigation was immediately launched on the issue.

The local governor of Kayseri called on people \u201cto act calmly, with moderation and common sense.\u201d Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan blamed opposition parties, some of which have taken a hard line on removing the estimated 3.6 million Syrians from the country, for stoking \u201chatred politics.\u201d Erdogan himself has pledged to create the conditions for large numbers of Syrians to voluntarily return to Syria. \u201cXenophobia and hatred towards refugees in our country should not be ignited because this does not give any positive results,\u201d he said in a speech on Monday. The riots in Kayseri also sparked backlash inside Syria. Video from the town of Atareb, which is currently under the control of Turkish troops, showed people chanting against the Turkish army\u2019s presence and throwing things at an armored vehicle. Another video showed the chaotic situation that followed, with plumes of smoke and the sound of gunshots. A local resident told CNN troops had used a smoke grenade and fired shots into the air to disperse the crowd. CNN cannot independently verify the resident\u2019s account. In another town, Ghazawiah, also in northwest Syria, protesters were seen pulling the Turkish flag town from a military site. A local resident there confirmed to CNN that the incident took place. At the \u201cBab al-Salama\u201d border crossing with Turkey, the Turkish flag was removed, burned and replaced with a Free Syrian Army flag, according to a local resident and images circulating on social media. Several internet providers in northern Syria appeared to be disconnected late Monday. Only satellite internet was still working. The largest umbrella group representing the Syrian opposition, the \u201cNational Coalition for Syrian Revolution and Opposition Forces\u201d released a statement urging Syrians on both sides of the border to \u201cexercise self-restraint.\u201d \u201cThe sole beneficiaries of this chaos, violations, and disorder are the regime and terrorist organizations,\u201d the statement read. Yerlikaya blamed bots and provocateurs for sowing discord on social media. He said that more than a third of accounts sharing content about the events in Kayseri on X were bots and that 10 accounts had been referred to prosecutors. \u201cWe will not tolerate those who threaten the peace and security of our country, make provocative posts, or engage in hate speech,\u201d he wrote on X. Turkey hosts more Syrian refugees than any other country, but Turkey has often struggled to integrate Syrian refugees fully into society. That, combined with a struggling economy, has turned Syrians into a political lightning rod in Turkey. Many Syrians accuse Turks of racist treatment. Countless Syrian children are not in schools because of a requirement that Syrians remain in the districts they were registered in originally \u2014 even after events such as last year\u2019s deadly earthquake in southern Turkey forced many of them to relocate. All of this comes just days after Erdogan said he was open to meeting with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to restore ties between the two countries \u2014 though last year Assad made clear the meeting could not take place so long as Turkish troops remained in Syria. Assad and Erdogan were once close and even vacationed together, but Erdogan eventually backed the Free Syrian Army that sought to oust Assad from power in Syria\u2019s civil war.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/world/turkey-riots-social-media-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_01_climate_india-delhi-floods-extreme-rain-intl-hnk", "text": "Deadly flash flooding due to sudden heavy rains has inundated India\u2019s capital, replacing one of the worst heat waves in Delhi\u2019s history that sent temperatures soaring well above 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit). An observatory in New Delhi on Friday reported 228.1 millimeters (nearly 9\u00a0inches) of rainfall in a 24-hour period, the most recorded in a single June day for 88 years and surpassing the city\u2019s average for the whole month, according to the Indian Meteorological Department. At least 11 people died from the rain and flooding last week, including four people  who drowned in submerged underpasses, Reuters reported citing local media. Heavy rains caused roads to flood, submerged cars and subways and cut power to some parts of the city. Video posted to social media showed waterlogged streets in Delhi as residents wade waist-deep through the floods. Delhi capital region \u201cis becoming home to extreme weather every season now,\u201d said independent weatherman Navdeep Dahiya on X. Heavy rain caused a section of roof at New Delhi\u2019s airport to collapse on Friday, crushing one man to death, and injuring eight others. Photos of the scene released by the fire service showed the large white canopy of the roof had plunged to the ground, crushing several cars. One person could be seen slumped under twisted metal in the driver\u2019s seat of one of the cars. The heavy rains have brought some respite from weeks of blistering heat, with one part of Delhi reaching 49.9 degrees Celsius (121.8 degrees Fahrenheit) in late May \u2014 the capital\u2019s highest temperature on record. This year\u2019s scorching heat wave persisted even after the blazing sun had set, with high nighttime temperatures providing little relief. The Indian Meteorological Department has issued a weather warning until July 4 as heavy rains\u00a0hit much of India\u2019s northeast, east and northwest coast. Red alerts, indicating the highest-level threat, were issued for parts of the northeast states of Assam, Meghalaya, West Bengal, Sikkim, Bihar, and Arunachal Pradesh on Sunday. \u201cHeavy to very heavy rainfall is very likely over northwest, east and northeast India over the next four to five days,\u201d Indian Meteorological Department said Sunday. In the state of Uttar Pradesh, which borders the Indian Capital Territory, two women reportedly died after a water tank collapsed in the heavy rain, according to ANI News. In Uttarakhand, video posted by ANI News shows vehicles swept away following heavy rain being hauled out of floodwaters. CNN cannot independently verify these reports. On Friday, five Indian army personnel died after their tank got stuck in flash floods while attempting to cross a river during training in India\u2019s northern Ladakh, the army said in a post on X. \u201cRescue teams rushed to the location, however, due to high current and water levels, the rescue mission didn\u2019t succeed and the tank crew lost their lives,\u201d the army said. Heavy monsoon rains have also caused damage in neighboring countries. In Nepal, at least nine people, including three children, were killed after rains triggered landslides in the country\u2019s west, Reuters reported, citing\u00a0an\u00a0official from the National Disaster Rescue and Reduction Management Authority. From no water to too much water India, the world\u2019s most populous nation, is one of the countries worst affected by the human-caused climate crisis, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \u2013 potentially affecting 1.4 billion people nationwide. The climate crisis is making extreme weather events more frequent and severe, scientists say, and this can be seen play out in\u00a0climate-vulnerable India which is suffering from extremes of heat, rainfall and other disasters such as cyclones. While India often experiences heat waves during the summer months of May and June, in recent years, they have arrived earlier and become more prolonged, with scientists linking some of these longer and more intense heat waves to climate change. New Delhi topped a recent list of hottest capital cities, recording 4,222 days above 35 degrees Celsius in the past three decades \u2013 more than any other city analyzed. Between 2014 and 2023, just under half (44%) of days in the Indian capital met that threshold, compared to 35% from 1994 to 2003, and 37% from 2004 to 2013. Delhi, like many cities in India, is suffering from a water crisis, with acute water shortages and lack of groundwater supply leaving many people to rely on water tankers for their supply of fresh, clean water. \u201cWe get water only once a day, and it\u2019s scalding hot, unless you fill up a bucket and let it cool off all day before using it, you can\u2019t bathe in this water,\u201d 60-year-old Kalyani Saha, a resident of the Lajpat Nagar neighborhood of the capital city, recently told CNN. Meanwhile, seasonal monsoon rains usually start in June until September, bringing bands of heavy rains from the southwest that quench fields, nourish crops, and replenish reservoirs. But recent studies have shown India\u2019s monsoons have become more erratic in the past 10 years, due to the climate crisis, posing significant risks to critical sectors such as agriculture, water, and energy. Last June, nearly half a million people in northeast\u00a0India\u00a0were affected by severe flooding after heavy rains battered the region. \u201cBecause of climate change, you will get more extreme rain events, which means more rain in a fewer number of rainy days, rainy hours,\u201d Sunita Narain, director general of Indian research body Centre for Science and Environment, said in a video post on YouTube last week. \u201cIf you look at the data from across India, you will find that many weather stations are already reporting that they are breaking the record of 24-hour rainfall, which means that a city, a region, can get its annual rain, as much as a whole year\u2019s rain, in a matter of a few days or even one day.\u201d Going from water scarcity to floods is a \u201ccycle that we are beginning to see more and more,\u201d Narain said, adding that it was an opportunity \u201cto make a change.\u201d In a separate video post on the importance of rainwater harvesting, Narain said, \u201cThe only way we can manage floods is when we can build drainage so that our rivers are drained into channels, into ponds, so that excess rain can be held and it can recharge groundwater for the dry season that comes after.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/climate/india-delhi-floods-extreme-rain-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_01_sport_ukraine-athletes-paris-olympics-spt-intl", "text": "Kateryna Tabashnyk couldn\u2019t hold back her tears \u2013 not necessarily because her attempt to qualify for her first Olympics had fallen short, but because she was now reflecting on all the grief and pain of the past two-and-a-half years. The 30-year-old high jumper cleared 1.89 meters at the Ukrainian Athletics Championships on Sunday, not enough to qualify for this year\u2019s Olympic Games in Paris. But the fact that she had even come so close was a testament to her remarkable willpower and perseverance. Tabashnyk\u2019s mother was killed in a Russian airstrike on Kharkiv two years ago. She had stayed in the eastern city to help her young nephew, who was seriously injured in an earlier attack by Russian forces. Tabashnyk decided to return to competition a month later, viewing sport as a means to honor her mother\u2019s life even in the depths of grief. \u201cOf course, it affects people and, of course, me \u2013 the loss of my home, the loss of my dear mother, the loss of friends,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cAll this takes strength, takes energy. It\u2019s like a poison for the body.\u201d \u201cWe have to prepare to compete and show results against this background. Of course, it\u2019s very hard, it\u2019s very difficult, but to be honest, I don\u2019t know where I\u2019ve been getting this energy, this strength for the last two years. It\u2019s something incredible, even for me.\u201d Ukraine will send a team of more than 100 athletes to Paris, and \u2013 though that\u2019s fewer than the country had in Tokyo three years ago \u2013 their participation will likely feel more significant. The Ukrainian athletes competing at the games have endured a myriad of challenges since Russia\u2019s invasion, including facilities being destroyed, friends and relatives being killed and uncertainty about what the future might hold. According to Ukraine\u2019s Sports Ministry, about 3,000 athletes \u2013 from Olympic and non-Olympic sports \u2013 have served for the country\u2019s military, either voluntarily or by being drafted, and 479 have been killed while serving or in civilian life. More than 500 sports facilities have been destroyed, including 15 Olympic training bases. Tabashnyk won bronze at the European Indoor Championships earlier this year \u2013 her first medal at a major event \u2013 and was hoping to be part of Ukraine\u2019s first Olympic team since Russia launched its full-scale invasion with the support of Belarus in February 2022. She had been confident of making the team before a recent injury hampered her preparation for the national championships in Lviv. \u201cYou can\u2019t imagine how many times I wanted to give it all up, give up on sports, on jumping,\u201d Tabashnyk said. \u201cBut every time I pull myself together and say, \u2018No, now I have to fight like never before.\u2019 And so it goes every time, no matter what obstacle stands in my way.\u201d She is far from the only Ukrainian athlete whose life has been scarred by Russia\u2019s invasion of their country. Many athletes have moved abroad in order to continue their careers and train for this year\u2019s Games. That includes 400-meter hurdler Viktoriia Tkachuk, who has become accustomed to undertaking the 46-hour trip from Ukraine to her training camp in South Africa. Tkachuk\u2019s brother was called up to the frontline in May last year, and since then, her whole family has been fraught with fear about his safety. \u201cWe were all stressed out because we were thinking, \u2018Oh, no, he\u2019s not ready yet, he cannot go there,\u2019\u201d the 29-year-old told CNN. \u201cBut we were doing our best to support him, because if he\u2019s worrying, then he will feel our worries and it will not help him.\u201d Tkachuk saw her brother in February when he had a break from military service, and the pair are in regular contact while they go about their separate lives. \u201cHe\u2019s texted me a message: \u2018You will win there, and I will win here,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cSomething like this. \u2026 He has in his pocket \u2013 close to his heart \u2013 small pictures with us together, our family, and he said this picture is always with him. It\u2019s nice to know this.\u201d Having already qualified for the Olympics, a minor injury prevented Tkachuk from competing in Lviv, where CNN spoke to several athletes looking to secure a spot on the team. Despite Russia\u2019s invasion casting a long shadow over Ukraine\u2019s participation at these Olympics, there was a vibrant atmosphere at the event, and most athletes were excited by the chance to compete for an Olympic berth. \u201cNow, with a big team under our flag, we take part in a big Olympic movement, we take part in the biggest contest, and the entire world is looking at us,\u201d Matviy Bidnyi, Ukraine\u2019s acting sports minister, told CNN. \u201cAll of the world awaits what we will do in the Olympic Games, what we can show in the Olympic Games \u2013 that our country, which is in a condition of war now, is in a good shape.\u201d \u201cThis is a very important mission,\u201d he added, \u201cand all our athletes understand their responsibility in it.\u201d Whether Russian and Belarusian athletes should be permitted to compete at this year\u2019s Olympics, which begin on July 26, has been the topic of intense debate, especially for Ukrainian athletes and officials. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has said that Russian and Belarusians can compete as Individual Neutral Athletes (AINs) in Paris, provided that they meet certain eligibility requirements. This means that teams of Russian and Belarusian athletes will not be considered, while athletes who actively support the war against Ukraine will also be ineligible. No reference to either country will be made at the Games through the athletes\u2019 participation, such as flags, anthems or national colors. The IOC ruled that it would be unfair to punish athletes based on their passports alone, but many people in Ukraine were hoping for a more stringent stance. \u201cWe think that this position is strong enough,\u201d said Bidnyi, \u201cbut we think it would be better if they were banned totally.\u201d There will be no Russians or Belarusians taking part in track and field events in Paris as governing body World Athletics has banned athletes from these two countries from competing at an elite level \u2013 the only Olympic sports federation to have done so. This means that athletes like Tkachuk will avoid the potentially challenging situation of lining up against competitors whose nations are at war with her country, irrespective of how they are presented at the Games. \u201cThis is really nice to know, for my brother also, that I\u2019m not going to competitions to run with Russians, or to speak with Russians, or to deal with something that I don\u2019t need,\u201d she said. Her teammate, fellow 400m hurdler Anna Ryzhykova, agrees. \u201cWe\u2019re not friends, we\u2019re not competitors,\u201d Ryzhykova told CNN about facing Russian and Belarusian athletes. \u201cThey don\u2019t have a right to be at the Olympics \u2026 because every one [of them] is guilty in some way.\u201d Like Tkachuk, Ryzhykova has had to spend time away from Ukraine while she trains and competes, basing herself in the Italian city of Brescia during the summer months. But being away from her family home in Dnipro isn\u2019t always easy. \u201cHome is my safe place where I can recharge, relax, where I feel good, where I can really rest between competitions or in my training life,\u201d says the 34-year-old, a 4x400m relay bronze medalist at the 2012 London Olympics. \u201cIn the training camps, it\u2019s totally different in other countries; it\u2019s good, some countries are really amazing, but it\u2019s not my native (country). I can\u2019t relax fully there.\u201d Ryzhykova has learned not to read the news on the days she has a competition, which means finding different ways to distract herself whenever thoughts of the war enter her mind. \u201cI use books, novels or something easier,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I have bad thoughts, I\u2019m going back to this novel, and [thinking], OK, what is my character doing? I need to concentrate on this. It\u2019s my plan for competition day.\u201d CNN\u2019s Svitlana Vlasova contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/sport/ukraine-athletes-paris-olympics-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_06_25_europe_icc-arrest-warrants-shoigu-gerasimov-intl", "text": "The International Criminal Court (ICC) has issued an arrest warrant for former Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and the Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov for alleged international crimes, war crimes and crimes against humanity. The court said Tuesday the pair were allegedly responsible for two war crimes: directing attacks at civilian objects and causing excessive incidental harm to civilians or damage to civilian objects. They are also accused of committing crimes against humanity. On the same day, Europe\u2019s top court found Russia guilty of systemic human rights violations in occupied Crimea committed since February 2014, marking a victory for Kyiv in its first interstate hearing brought against Moscow over the peninsula that could pave the way for more such cases. Following the ICC\u2019s announcement, Russian state news agency TASS quoted the Security Council of Russia, the government body headed by Shoigu, as calling the the court\u2019s decision \u201cnull and void.\u201d \u201cIt is meaningless, as the ICC\u2019s jurisdiction does not extend to Russia, and [the decision] was made within the framework of the West\u2019s hybrid war against our country,\u201d TASS quoted the body as saying. Ukrainian officials welcomed the ICC\u2019s announcement on Tuesday. President Volodymyr Zelensky said the decision shows that \u201cno military rank or cabinet door can shield Russian criminals from accountability.\u201d The country\u2019s human rights ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said the ICC decision meant Ukraine was a step closer to getting justice. \u201cSooner or later, a just punishment will overtake every war criminal!\u201d he said in a statement posted on his Telegram. Andriy\u00a0Yermak, the head of Ukraine\u2019s presidential office, said Shoigu and Gerasimov were being held \u201cindividually responsible.\u201d \u201cThis is an important decision. Everyone will be held accountable for evil,\u201d he said in a statement. The arrest warrants put Shoigu and Gerasimov on the ICC\u2019s wanted list, although it is uncertain whether they will ever stand trial. The court does not conduct trials in absentia and it is unlikely they would be handed over by Moscow. The two warrants bring the total number of top Russian officials wanted for war crimes to four as the ICC has previously issued arrest warrants for President\u00a0Vladimir Putin\u00a0and Russian official\u00a0Maria Lvova-Belova\u00a0for an alleged scheme to deport Ukrainian children to Russia. Located in The Hague, Netherlands, and created by a treaty called the Rome Statute, the ICC operates independently. Most countries \u2013 124 of them \u2013 are parties to the treaty, but there are notable exceptions, including the United States, Russia and Ukraine. Under the Rome Statue, any country that is a signatory is obliged to arrest and hand over anyone facing an ICC arrest warrant. Crimea human rights ruling In a separate case Tuesday, the European Court of Human Rights unanimously ruled that Russia violated 11 articles of the European Convention of Human Rights in Crimea, which was annexed by Moscow following its illegal invasion of the peninsula 10 years ago. They included violations of the rights to life, liberty, security and a fair trial, and the prohibition of inhuman or degrading treatment, according to a court news release. The court also found that Russia violated three protocols of the European Convention: the protection of property, the right to education, and the freedom of movement. The court ruled Russia must safely return prisoners who were taken from Crimea into Russia. Some of the violations that Russia was found guilty of date back to 2014. Margarita Sokorenko, Commissioner for the European Court of Human Rights of the Ministry of Justice of Ukraine, said the ruling \u201cessentially nullifies Russia\u2019s decades-long claims that human rights in Crimea are respected.\u201d Russia has previously denied allegations of human rights violations in Crimea, and was expelled from the Council of Europe in March 2022 following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. In response, Moscow removed itself from the European court\u2019s jurisdiction, and set March 15, 2022 as a cut-off point after which it claimed any rulings made against Russia would not count. Harming civilians Shoigu, one of the Russian nationals wanted by the ICC, is a long-time close ally of Putin who served as Russia\u2019s defense minister for 12 years. He was fired by Putin last month, replaced with the economist Andrey Belousov. He led the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, which caught Kyiv by surprise but was soon pushed back, exposing the weaknesses of Moscow\u2019s corruption-riddled military. Still, Shoigu has remained a popular politician in Russia. Having spent two decades as the minister of emergency situations, he cultivated an image of an official who brings help when it\u2019s needed. Gerasimov, meanwhile, has been at the helm of Russia\u2019s armed forces for more than a decade. He was one of a small group of people responsible for planning the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. He was formally appointed as the overall commander of the campaign in January 2023. The ICC said the alleged crimes relate to \u201ca large number of strikes against numerous electric power plants and sub-stations\u201d that were carried out by the Russia across Ukraine between October 2022 and at least March 2023. The panel of three judges who made the decision to issue the arrest warrants on Monday concluded that Shoigu and Gerasimov ordered strikes against civilian objects, which constitutes a war crime under international humanitarian laws. The judges also said that even though some of the targets could have been seen as relevant to Russia\u2019s military campaign at that time, it was clear that striking them would cause harm to civilians and that the expected harm would be excessive compared to the military advantage of hitting them. The court\u2019s prosecutor Karim Khan said in a separate statement on Tuesday that the Russian campaign at that time represented \u201ca course of conduct involving the multiple commission of acts against a civilian population.\u201d As such, he said, the actions by Shoigu and Gerasimov may amount to a crime against humanity. That designation is reserved for the most serious crimes committed as part of a widespread, systemic attack directed at a civilian population.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/europe/icc-arrest-warrants-shoigu-gerasimov-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "world"}}

Brandalism said it launched the campaign against Barclays Bank, which has a multi-year sponsorship deal with Wimbledon reportedly worth more than $25 million, over its ties to the fossil fuel industry and companies that supply arms to Israel. \u201cWimbledon\u2019s cherished strawberries and cream image has been thoroughly sullied by its decision to partner with Barclays, the most toxic bank in Europe, while the bank continues to pour millions into the arms trade and fossil fuel companies driving climate chaos,\u201d Kit Speedwell, a spokesperson for\u00a0Brandalism, said in a statement. \u201cWimbledon must stop providing cover for Barclays\u2019 grotesque lack of morals and immediately end the sponsorship deal,\u201d Speedwell added. One of the \u201chacked\u201d billboards shows the body of a tennis player on a grass court. Blood appears to be seeping from the body, which is lying next to a huge crater alongside the caption: \u201cFrom Gaza to global warming, we\u2019re making a killing.\u201d Another shows a player serving on one half and oil lapping the sea on the other half with the caption: \u201cA doubles team against the\u00a0climate.\u201d Alongside the billboard campaign, more than 100 people gathered outside the All England Lawn Tennis Club Monday to protest Barclays sponsorship of Wimbledon at a demonstration organized by the Palestine Solidarity Campaign. In May, the campaign published a report alleging that Barclays \u201chad shareholdings in, and/or provided loans and financial services to, at least nine companies known to be producing weapons and military technology sold to Israel and used in its militarised attacks on Palestinians.\u201d A statement from Barclays emailed to CNN Monday said the bank was \u201cproud of our partnership with Wimbledon which supports the growth of The Championships and opportunities for young people across the UK through the Wimbledon Foundation. \u201cLike many other banks, we provide financial services to companies supplying defence products to the UK, NATO and its allies.\u201d The statement emphasized that those services did not include investments\u00a0for Barclays, noting\u00a0that, \u201cdecisions on the implementation of arms embargos to other nations are the job of respective elected\u00a0governments.\u201d Barclays also pushed back against criticism over its financing for the fossil fuel industry, which a recent report found reached more than $235 billion between 2016 and 2023. In the statement, the bank argued that investing in oil and gas assets would continue to be important as the clean energy industry develops. Barclays emphasized its committment to \u201cfinancing an energy sector in transition, including providing $1trn of Sustainable and Transition Finance by 2030 to build a cleaner and more secure energy system.\u201d When reached by CNN for\u00a0comment on the protests, an All England Lawn Tennis Club\u00a0spokesperson said:\u00a0\u201cBarclays is an important partner of ours and we are working closely with them in a number of areas, including through our Set for Success programme, which is helping to support disadvantaged secondary students in schools across the UK.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/sport/wimbledon-protests-barclays-climate-change-palestine-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "world"}}

World-famous for her seemingly fearless approach to performance art, Abramovi\u0107 once invited members of the public to interact with her however they liked during a 6-hour sitting. The 1974 piece, titled \u201cRhythm 0,\u201d resulted in a loaded gun being held to her head. On the Glastonbury main stage Abramovi\u0107\u00a0asked the festival\u2019s 250,000 attendees to turn inward.\u00a0\u201cPeople come to have a good time. They\u2019re drinking, taking drugs, the weather is good,\u201d she told Vogue ahead of the event. \u201cBut I\u2019m asking them to be silent and to reflect on the state of this planet, which is really hell right now.\u201d If silencing a music festival the size of a small English town wasn\u2019t powerful enough, the artist\u00a0also chose an outfit to remember. Standing tall, her shoulders sloped to create the top of the peace sign \u2014 her hands lost in the round of the giant white sleeves. At hip level, more fabric jutted out to create the upside-down \u2018V\u2019 shape. The dress, designed by her friend and former Burberry creative director Riccardo Tisci, was inspired by the Japanese kimono. According to Abramovi\u0107, it will eventually be exhibited in a museum. While we\u2019re more familiar seeing peace signs printed on crop tops or canvas tote bags, Abramovi\u0107 and Tisci\u2019s IRL-rendering is closer to the symbol\u2019s creation story. Designed by British artist Gerald Holtom, the icon first debuted on a London peace march in 1958 and was later adopted by the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND). Holtom wrote that the idea for the sign came from his own human form. \u201cI drew myself: the representation of an individual in despair, with hands and palms outstretched, outwards and downwards in the manner of Goya\u2019s peasant before the firing squad. I formalized the drawing into a line and put a circle round it.\u201d More than six decades later, Holtom\u2019s peace sign has become one of the world\u2019s most recognized symbols \u2014 particularly on the runway. Throughout the years, it has adorned everything from Fendi Baguette bags to Dior knitwear. At Moschino in 2014, the design was fashioned into luxurious pendants on heavy, golden donkey rope chains; while the following year at Chanel, it appeared in Sharpie-style scrawl on distressed messenger bags \u2014 a punctuation mark to the revised phrase \u201cMake fashion, not war.\u201d Abramovi\u0107\u2019s outfit was very much in-keeping with Glastonbury\u2019s overarching theme for 2024: Peace. Holtom\u2019s sign was seen throughout the festival grounds, crowning the roof of the newly erected Peace Stage, and earlier in the week, appearing in the sky during the event\u2019s first ever drone display. As she faced the crowd, Abramovi\u0107 surrendered to the power of the symbol sewn into her dress. \u201cSee how we can feel positive energy in the entire universe,\u201d she told on-lookers. What originally began for Holtom as a mark of despair, suddenly became an open embrace.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/style/marina-abramovic-glastonbury-crowd-silence/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "world"}}

The Princess Royal, 73, had been injured while walking near horses at the royal estate, in Gloucestershire, western England, on Sunday evening. Anne will continue to rest and recover at home, returning to public engagements when her medical team recommends it is safe and comfortable to do so, the source told CNN. Her husband Vice-Adm. Tim Laurence expressed his gratitude to the medical staff for their care. He said in a statement, \u201cI would like to extend my warmest thanks to all the team at Southmead Hospital for their care, expertise and kindness during my wife\u2019s short stay.\u201d The exact circumstances that led to the Princess Royal\u2019s injuries were not clear but there were horses in the vicinity and previously her medical team said that her head injuries were consistent with a potential impact from a horse\u2019s head or legs. Emergency services were sent to the estate and, after medical care at the scene, she was transferred to Southmead Hospital in Bristol for appropriate tests, treatment and observation. CNN understands the princess has not been able to recall the details of what happened on Sunday evening due to her concussion. While it\u2019s not known how long the princess will be convalescing for, she will be receiving rehabilitation support at home as she follows standard concussion protocols. Anne is widely considered to be one of the hardest working royals, dutifully undertaking hundreds of engagements each year. She is one of several senior royals that stepped up further to support the King when he briefly stepped away from public-facing duties following his cancer diagnosis. The five-day hospital stay caused the princess to miss several engagements this week, including a state banquet at Buckingham Palace held for the emperor and empress of Japan on the first day of their state visit to the United Kingdom. She had also been due to travel to Canada for a royal visit this weekend. Her accident is the latest in a series of health challenges the family has faced since the new year, with her brother Charles and the Princess of Wales continuing their cancer treatments. Sarah Ferguson,\u00a0Duchess of York was also diagnosed with malignant melanoma in January. This story has been updated.

As CNN has reported, the Israeli government has been\u00a0looking to \u201cstrengthen\u201d Jewish settlements\u00a0in the occupied West Bank after several countries unilaterally recognized a Palestinian state. The spokesperson for Israel\u2019s far-right finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, told CNN that the Israeli government had agreed in a late-night cabinet to\u00a0recognize five Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank that were built illegally and that Smotrich will release tax funds to the Palestinian Authority that Israel collects on its behalf. In a statement to CNN on Sunday, Smotrich\u2019s office said the decision to release funds to the Palestinian Authority was \u201cimmediate\u201d and would cover the past three months. Funds have been frozen following the October 7 attacks. CNN reached out to the Prime Minister\u2019s office, which has not yet publicly commented on the reports. Once authorized, settlements become more like parts of Israel, with access to water, electricity and medical care. The Palestinian Authority, which administers some areas of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, told CNN on Sunday that it has not yet received the funds from Israel. \u201cSo far, no money or official messages from the Israeli side have been received,\u201d an official source in the Palestinian Authority\u00a0said. Smotrich is a leading far-right member of the Israeli cabinet and opposes the creation of an independent Palestinian state. He has long advocated for the building of settlements, pointing to them as a means of preventing the West Bank becoming part of such an independent state.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThe goal is to change the DNA of the system for many, many years,\u201d he said,\u00a0according to leaked audio\u00a0from a speech he made earlier this month. The European Union as well as several Middle Eastern countries have denounced the plans. In a statement posted on X on Saturday, EU spokesperson Peter Stano said the organization \u201ccondemns in the strongest terms\u201d the announcement by Smotrich. \u201cThis is another deliberate attempt at undermining peace efforts,\u201d he added. Qatar called the decision \u201ca new chapter in the ongoing violations of international legitimacy resolutions,\u201d according to Qatar\u2019s official news agency. In separate statements, Egypt and Saudi Arabia also called it a violation of international law and Security Council resolutions. \u201cEgypt strongly denounced Israel\u2019s exploitation of the ongoing war in the Gaza Strip to push more illegal settlement expansion and attempts to change the legal situation in the occupied Palestinian territories, including East Jerusalem,\u201d the Egyptian government said. Saudi Arabia said the moves \u201cundermine the chances for peace, fuel conflicts, and impair regional and international security and stability,\u201d according to a foreign ministry statement. Israel has\u00a0expanded settlements\u00a0in the occupied West Bank over decades despite signing a series of peace agreements with the Palestinians in the 1990s, called the Oslo Accords, that envisaged the establishment of an independent Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza as part of a negotiated resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Such settlements\u00a0are considered illegal under international law and by much of the international community.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/30/middleeast/israel-west-bank-settlements-international-condemnation-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "world"}}

The Recording Industry Association of America \u2013 the trade group on behalf of labels including Sony Music Entertainment, UMG Recordings and Warner Records \u2013 filed two copyright infringement cases against AI companies Suno and Uncharted Labs, the developer behind Udio, for training their AI models with the labels\u2019 unlicensed sound recordings. Udio is the company behind \u201cBBL Drizzy,\u201d the AI-generated song that went viral last month during the Kendrick Lamar and Drake spat. Udio was founded last year by former Google DeepMind researchers to make it \u201ceasy for anyone to create emotionally resonant music in an instant,\u201d according to the company. In April, it raised $10 million in funding. Meanwhile, Suno raised $125 million in funding last month. The platform, which allows users to create songs with only a few prompts, relies on OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT for lyrics and title development. Udio and Suno did not immediately respond to a request for comment. RIAA CEO Mitch Glazier said in a statement that the lawsuits are \u201cnecessary to reinforce the most basic rules of the road for the responsible, ethical, and lawful development of generative AI systems and to bring Suno\u2019s and Udio\u2019s blatant infringement to an end.\u201d He added that the music community is already partnering and collaborating with \u201cresponsible developers to build sustainable AI tools\u201d that put artists and songwriters in charge, but unlicensed services can exploit an artist\u2019s work \u201cwithout consent or pay set back \u2026 .\u201d In April, more than 200 artists, including Billie Eilish, Kacey Musgraves, J Balvin, Ja Rule, Jon Bon Jovi, The Jonas Brothers, Katy Perry, Miranda Lambert and more, signed an open letter\u00a0organized by the non-profit Artist Rights Alliance calling on AI developers, technology companies, platforms and digital music services to \u201ccease the use of artificial intelligence to infringe upon and devalue the rights of human artists.\u201d The lawsuit against Udio states \u201cif developed with the permission and participation of copyright owners, generative AI tools will be able to assist humans in creating and producing new and innovative music.\u201d It added: \u201cBut if developed irresponsibly, without regard for fundamental copyright protections, those same tools threaten enduring and irreparable harm to recording artists, record labels, and the music industry, inevitably reducing the quality of new music available to consumers and diminishing our shared culture.\u201d Meanwhile, the lawsuit against Suno states the company has over 10,000,000 users generating music files using the platform, bringing in about 2,000,000 streams. \u201cThese digital music files have been released to the public\u2014some already finding their way onto the major streaming services\u2014and compete with the copyrighted sound recordings that enabled their creation; yet Suno sought no permission from and gives no credit or compensation to the human artists or other rightsholders whose works fueled their creation.\u201d This story has been updated with additional context and developments.

{"id": "2024_05_02_style_aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl", "text": "Miami has a new addition to its skyline \u2013 a 66-story residential tower built by Aston Martin, marking the British luxury sports carmaker\u2019s first foray into the residential real estate market. Comprising of 391 units, Aston Martin Residences Miami sits at the mouth of the Miami River on Biscayne Bay, the firm said in a statement Tuesday. Designed in partnership with architect Rodolfo Miani of Bodas Mian Anger and built by G&G Business Developments, the 249-meter- (818-foot-) tall building houses seven penthouses, each with private pools and terraces, as well as apartments ranging in size from one to five bedrooms. The largest unit is the \u201cUnique Triplex Penthouse,\u201d arranged over three floors at the top of the building, which remains on the market for $59 million. The property was officially opened on Tuesday. Timed to coincide with the Formula One Miami Grand Prix, the company said in a statement that it marks \u201cthe latest distinct expression of Aston Martin\u2019s ultra-luxury high performance brand.\u201d Featuring an infinity pool with a pool deck, jacuzzis and cabanas on the 55th floor, the sail-shaped complex has a two-floor fitness center, two movie theaters and a virtual golf simulator. The building has a sky bar and lounge, chef\u2019s kitchen, ballroom and private dining areas, as well as a spa, beauty salon and barber shop. Direct access to the sea via a superyacht marina is also available, plus a private butler service. Germ\u00e1n Coto, chief executive officer of G&G Business Developments, told CNN Tuesday that the firm wanted to work on a project in the \u201ccosmopolitan city\u201d of Miami, and that this piece of land was the perfect choice. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing plot with an excellent view of the river,\u201d said Coto. The structure\u2019s aerodynamic shape helps the building deal with the technical challenges presented by high winds in the area, as well as evoking the sleek shape of an Aston Martin, according to Marek Reichman, executive vice president and chief creative officer of Aston Martin. It also becomes wider from the base to the mid-section before tightening once more towards the top, making it appear to bow out over people on street level, Reichman told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the drama,\u201d he added. Challenges However, the process wasn\u2019t all plain sailing. \u201cIt was difficult to achieve what we wanted because the space and the plot is kind of small,\u201d said Coto, with the building fitting into a 1.25-acre plot of land. Meanwhile, local building regulations imposed strict standards, explained Reichman, taking into account the low-lying land and propensity for flooding. \u201cThey were some of the most amazing challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to withstand the flooding with the windows that are on street level.\u201d There were further obstacles due to the curved shape of the building, which means that units on the east side have an individual architectural structural component. Aston Martin touches Homeowners are able to customize their interior space with the help of the Aston Martin design team, with three style packages \u2013 Timeless, Covert and Indulgent \u2013 drawing on the company\u2019s British heritage, as well as the building\u2019s context. \u201cIt needs to have part of the DNA of an Aston Martin,\u201d Reichman said. \u201cBut we are in Miami, you don\u2019t have a cold November evening where you need to put the log fire on, so you\u2019ve got to be considerate of the environment that you\u2019re in.\u201d Design elements running through the building include doors with bespoke Aston Martin handles, number plinths and kestrel tan leather door tabs. Aston Martin said that 99% of the properties sold before the building was completed. Residences were sold for $1.5 million to $8.5 million, while penthouses ranged from $16 million to $59 million. The Unique Triplex Penthouse, on the market for $59 million, comes with the last remaining Aston Martin Vulcan, an 820 brake horsepower all-carbon fiber supercar, of which only 24 exist, a spokesman for the company said. Meanwhile, buyers of the 47 Signature and Penthouse units were also able to choose between an Aston Martin DBX sports SUV or the company\u2019s DB11 sportscar. Aston Martin isn\u2019t the first luxury carmaker to enter the residential property market. A 63-story building from Bentley will open in 2026 along the coastline of Sunny Isles Beach, Florida. Featuring 216 units, the property will have an elevator designed to take residents up to their doorstep while seated inside their cars.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/02/style/aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "world"}}

Al Hassan Ag Abdoul Aziz Ag Mohamed Ag Mahmoud, who was a senior member of the Islamic Police, was recruited by al Qaeda leaders, the\u00a0ICC said in a statement. The Islamic Police played a \u201cpivotal role\u201d in the system that al Qaeda, alongside Islamist group Ansar Dine, put in place to commit crimes against humanity and war crimes in Timbuktu between April 2012 and May 2013, the ICC said. Al Hassan was convicted by majority of directly committing, contributing to, or aiding and abetting crimes against humanity of torture and war crimes of torture and outrages upon personal dignity, the ICC confirmed. The court, in the Dutch city of The Hague, acquitted him of crimes related to rape, sexual slavery, forced marriage and attacking protected objects due to insufficient evidence that he was responsible, the statement said. The ICC said that 2,196 victims participated in the trial proceedings. Across 195 hearings, 7,896 documents were recorded and 13,275 items of evidence were submitted, the court said. Al Hassan will remain in detention until he is sentenced in a separate hearing. Parties have 30 days to appeal the conviction.

{"id": "2024_07_01_style_paris-haute-couture-week-2024", "text": "Since the 19th century, haute couture has been bringing together both ancient craftsmanship and the evolving needs of clients, as social backdrops shift and change, aiming to provide a rarefied elegance for the happy few who can afford it. \u201cCouture serves to maintain France\u2019s excellency on a world map, both in terms of creation and know-how, also serving as a conservatory of traditions inherited from as far back as Louis XIV\u201d explained Alice Litscher, professor at Paris\u2019s Institut Fran\u00e7ais de la Mode in an interview. In the wake of last week\u2019s Haute Couture Fashion Week and in the midst of the decisive\u00a0French elections, a general sense of unrest is palpable in the country. Even though politics have been increasingly present on the ready-to-wear runways, the couture collections reflect focus back on the garments, offering quiet excellence for some, and a \u2014 much-needed \u2014 space for fantasy for others. Practical reality A few weeks after Chanel announced the\u00a0departure of creative director Virginie Viard\u00a0(who took over Karl Lagerfeld\u2019s position in 2019), the house unveiled a new collection \u2014 albeit designed by the studio. Presented in the grandiose Opera Garnier, it explored elegance in a hushed, restrained manner, safely building on the well-established, transgenerational style vocabulary of the house: Richly embroidered and bejeweled pastel tweeds, skirt-suits embellished with ruffled sleeves, long dress-coats, hair pulled back with oversized black bows and, fittingly, considering the venue, opera capes aimed at a clientele who travels, dines, but might not cherish social-media-ready pieces. At Patou, the \u201cRose\u201d collection also suggested a quiet sense of elevation. \u201cThis season, I want the Patou woman to be committed, but not necessarily to have the appearance of her commitment\u2026 I want her to be fresh before anything,\u201d said creative director Guillaume Henry backstage \u2014 perhaps suggesting a move away from the performative activism of recent years. He showcased candy and floral toned daily pieces, tailored denim, functional knitwear, shirt dresses, a play on accessories with neck scarves and gold detailing, saying his work at Patou is \u201cthe alliance of elegance, form, simplicity and joy.\u201d As show notes underline, this era is a sensible one: \u201cPatou\u2019s Rose is a collection grounded in reality: a practical one.\u201d Entering their Villain Era Swiss psychoanalyst Carl Jung developed the concept of a \u201cshadow self,\u201d the dark facet to every identity:\u00a0\u201cOne does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light, but by making the darkness conscious,\u201d the philosopher wrote. That notion, also known in modern parlance as \u201centering a villain era\u201d has become surprisingly popular on TikTok, and also ran through several collections. At Charles de Vilmorin, for a collection entitled \u201cR\u00eaveuse Bourgeoise\u201d (Dreamy Bourgeoise), the show was set up as a play, filled with visual elements fit for fairy tales or \u201ccommedia dell\u2019arte\u201d (Italian comedy) plays: a rodent mask, feathers aflame, drapes and capes; each seeming to evoke a grandiose baddie fit for a historical drama. Gowns with the flair of theater costumes (a distinct departure from his ready-to-wear garments) turned haute couture into an escape from reality. At Robert Wun, on the other hand, each silhouette evolved to a different element. For his tenth anniversary, the designer presented a collection revolving around time, showing cycles of life, metamorphosis, death even; playing with the darker facets of the human experience (including a full skull mask). Decaying flowers, flesh, bones and skulls were all referenced in the collection and textiles, celebrating the multifaceted, transient nature of life. Science meets nature For some designers, couture is also a laboratory of experimentation \u2014 including\u00a0Iris Van Herpen, who combined savoir-faire in areas including technology, science and art. The designer showed aerial sculptures featuring models embedded in the garments and hung to the wall.\u00a0The collection also included pieces replicating the effects of waves on the sand and sea, dresses that played with a gradient of pearls (some sculpted with a heat gun) and a process fusing organza with 3D printing and lace. These creations are the result of a discussion with French chemist Emmanuel Farge from Institut Marie Curie:\u00a0\u201cabout\u00a0the primal organisms within the sea 700 million years ago and how they have changed our senses (and what we) experience today\u201d said the designer during the presentation, elaborating upon how nature informs her sensitivity and creative eye. In a similar vein,\u00a0ArdAzAei\u00a0explored how geometry and mathematics reveal rhythms of nature, imagined by\u00a0Bahareh Ardakani, founder and artistic director of the house. She played with some notions of quantum physics and their potential visual impact, and explored how multiple dimensions of string theory, laid flat, can look like flower petals. This was materialized in silk and satin petals on envelope skirts, fishtailed gowns, both geometric and natural, crystals arranged in floral compositions and via the use of double embroidery for a \u201cbig bang effect of light exploding from a dress\u201d she said. Conceptual couture Viktor and Rolf\u2019s \u201cHaute Abstraction\u201d collection looked, as show notes pointed out, to \u201cexpress a certain absurdism.\u201d Evoking their \u201cAtomic Bomb\u201d collection from 1998, it played with geometrical shapes, squares and spheres, both childlike and conceptual. \u201cWe were thinking of something abstract, like boxes, cubes, balls, and combining them with the human body. When we are in the mood for abstraction, we get a feeling of freedom\u2026 There is no interpretation, but a moment of space,\u201d said the duo backstage, adding that this was achieved in \u201cvery couture-oriented materials\u201d such as silk duchesse, Lurex and jacquard. In a different vein, designer Rahul Mishra\u2019s collection, \u201cAura,\u201d quoted mysticism and the universe for a spiritual, experimental take on fashion.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026all about creating something intangible, something we know exists, but we cannot see\u201d he said backstage. The statuesque, surrealist silhouettes were created with metal structures and glass elements, all contrasting with embellishment and hand embroidery, and all made in India, where the designer lives. The color black used throughout the pieces designates \u201ca condensation of all colors, mystery, infinity,\u201d he explained. Sporty elevation With the approach of the Olympic Games, Dior jumped on the occasion \u201cThis d\u00e9fil\u00e9 represents an extraordinary opportunity to combine couture and sportswear with classicism, rebellion, collective energy\u201d the show notes report, and in front of a fresco of women athletes, the show paid tribute to \u201csportives,\u201d with peplum elements, draping, silk dresses, skirts that revealed draped trousers, as well as moir\u00e9 jacquard, for a sporty, effect and sense of a body in motion. For Balenciaga, (also notable for drag queen Alexis Stone\u2019s appearance impersonating Miranda Priestley from 2006 movie \u201cThe Devil Wears Prada\u201d), the show was an occasion to merge founder Cristobal Balenciaga\u2019s DNA with \u201ca tribute to subculture codes,\u201d including a hand-dyed faux fur coat in synthetic hair; a knitted, embroidered goth maxi dress featuring black upcycled beads and jackets worn tied around the hips reworked into trousers \u2014 all elevating the often mundane. And, as every year, Jean-Paul Gaultier invited a new designer to present under his name. This time head of Courr\u00e8ges Nicolas Di Felice, known for his sporty, techno-inspired wear, showed a minimalist collection, evoking a sporty, contemporary life-gone-couture. This included a sheath dress in tulle held together with 42,000 hooks and a trompe-l\u2019\u0153il dress, each model with sheathed face, asking, perhaps, for anonymity\u2026 Something scarce in 2024.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/style/paris-haute-couture-week-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_europe_ukraine-moldova-eu-talks-intl", "text": "Formal negotiations between Ukraine and Moldova on joining the European Union begin on Tuesday, a landmark moment for the two former Soviet-bloc countries that marks the start of a long, drawn-out process. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a post on X:\u00a0 \u201cCongratulations to Moldova and Ukraine on opening accession negotiations. This is very good news for the people of Ukraine, Moldova, and the entire European Union. The path ahead will be challenging but full of opportunities.\u201d The two nations first applied to join the EU in 2022, shortly after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. While the bloc has been broadly supportive of Ukraine and sent over $100 billion, according to EU figures, the path to joining the EU for either country will  be far from smooth. Hungary, Russia\u2019s main ally within the EU, has dragged its feet on a number of issues concerning Ukraine, including military and financial aid. In December of last year, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said he would block Kyiv\u2019s bid to begin accession talks. He eventually dropped his objections, however, Orban will still have plenty of opportunities to frustrate Ukraine. The path to EU membership requires candidate to meet a set of criteria before entering into detailed chapters of negotiation \u2013 known as the chapters of the acquis \u2013 covering a range of issues, from economic standards to rule of law. There are 35 chapters in total, all of which must be agreed by all negotiating parties, including the 27 EU member states. The process of opening, negotiating and closing all 35 chapters is expected to take over a decade for both Moldova and Ukraine. Further to this, neither country has yet to meet the criteria to even reach this stage of the negotiations. Meeting the criteria is particularly complicated for Ukraine, as it is virtually impossible to meet the standards required while under invasion and at war. Moldova, too has domestic difficulties, with the self-declared Moldovan independent state of Transnistria seeking alliance with Russia while the rest of the country turns to Europe. Transnistria is internationally still recognized as part of Moldova, but it is not implausible that some will see this as a reason the country cannot join the EU while the matter is unresolved. Practical and technical negations aside, there is also a political dimension to this that is likely to complicate negations. Expanding the bloc to the east of Europe will have consequences for the rest of the EU member states. It is likely both Ukraine and Moldova will be net recipients of the EU budget. That makes it a harder sell for all the existing EU nations, as their spending will go up and their overall share of the budget will fall. There will also be implications for industry. Ukraine, for example, has already run into trouble with European partners over its agricultural industry. Poland, one of the most consistent supporters of Ukraine in its war effort, temporarily banned Ukraine from exporting grain into the country because it was harming Polish farmers. The spat escalated, with Poland suspending its military support for Ukraine. Perhaps more importantly, accepting Ukraine and Moldova to the bloc would mean adding around 40 million new EU citizens from Eastern Europe. This means giving freedom of movement within the bloc to many people who might want to escape what has recently been a war zone. It would also shift the balance of power within the EU further to the east. While there are no hard and fast rules about which member states align on which issues, it is broadly reasonable to say that the eastern countries have different political views to southern and Western European countries. That could mean some existing EU member states will slow down and frustrate the process unless certain safeguards are put in place protecting their own privileged positions within the bloc. The start of negotiations is a big moment for those hoping to join the bloc to they can move further away from Russian influence and into the EU yolk. But in reality, these opening talks are mostly symbolic and there is still a long way to go before either country becomes a full member state.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/europe/ukraine-moldova-eu-talks-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_01_middleeast_ultra-orthodox-in-israel-defy-orders-to-serve-in-military-mime-intl", "text": "As thousands of men hurried towards the main square in Jerusalem\u2019s ultra-Orthodox neighborhood of Mea Shearim on Sunday for a protest, they passed signs declaring \u201cwar\u201d on a contentious order from Israel\u2019s highest court. The Supreme Court ruling on June 25 said the Israeli government must enlist draft-age ultra-Orthodox (or Haredi) Jews into the military, reversing a de facto exemption in place since the country\u2019s founding 76 years ago. Sunday\u2019s rally in Shabbat Square, which drew thousands, was to demonstrate against the decision, which another poster said had \u201cthrust a sword\u201d through the \u201cbeit midrash,\u201d or Torah study hall. The protest highlighted the fault line in Israeli society between ultra-Orthodox Jews, who Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu relies on to maintain his government, and other Israelis, many of whom believe that all Jewish citizens should serve in the military, especially during wartime. Many Haredi men spend much of their early lives out of the workforce, instead studying at religious schools known as yeshivas that are partly funded through government subsidies. For many Haredis, the idea that they would be pulled from studying scripture and drafted into Israel\u2019s military is simply out of the question. An arrangement made during Israel\u2019s founding exempted several hundred Haredi men from conscription. However, the community has since grown exponentially, allowing tens of thousands of ultra-Orthodox men to now avoid the draft. \u201cWe will not enlist,\u201d said Yosef, 22, who traveled to the protest from his home in Beitar Illit, a large Haredi settlement in the occupied West Bank. \u201cSince the beginning of the state (of Israel), we have not enlisted\u2026 Now they want to make us (serve) by force. It will never work,\u201d he said. \u201cIn a democratic state there is not much they can do besides put us in prison. We are not afraid of prison. We laugh about prison\u2026 and the more people that go into prison, the more demonstrations there will be in the country.\u201d As Yosef spoke, he looked up at a group of boys climbing a ladder to a nearby lamppost to hang a sign that read: \u201cWe will not enlist in the army.\u201d \u201cWe can\u2019t watch as they tear the Torah to shreds,\u201d said another man, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, due to the cultural norms of his community, some of whom are not open to speaking to the press. \u201cWe can\u2019t be quiet. The High Court, the government, all the Knesset (parliament)\u2026 they are looking for ways for compromise and to send Haredi boys to be destroyed. We will die rather than be enlisted.\u201d The clashes between some protesters and police following the gathering in Mea Shearim \u00a0underscored the depth of emotion in the ultra-Orthodox community, many of whom believe that serving in the military is incompatible with their way of life. Some ultra-Orthodox neighborhoods like Mea Shearim shun modern technology. A man at Sunday\u2019s protest held a placard stating: \u201cLife is happy only without internet and films.\u201d Five people were arrested in confrontations after some threw rocks, set trash cans on fire and attacked the car of Housing Minister Yitzhak Goldknopf, himself a Haredi Jew. \u2018God is going to help them\u2019 But Haredi journalist Yanki Farber told CNN in a telephone interview ahead of the protest that although the protesters in Mea Shearim would be among the most \u201cextreme\u201d of Israel\u2019s ultra-Orthodox communities, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision \u2014 requiring the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) to recruit all Israeli men equally \u2014 had left the wider community reeling. He said that for many Haredis, the court\u2019s decision won\u2019t change their stance, adding that many said they would \u201cneed to starve because they\u2019re not going to have money to buy food,\u201d referring to the court\u2019s edict that the government must withdraw funding from any yeshivas whose students do not comply with draft notices. \u201cThey still refuse to join the Israeli army. They (say they) are just not worried about it. And they trust in God, that God is going to help them,\u201d said Farber, who writes for the ultra-Orthodox Hadrei Haredim website. Given that most other Israeli Jews are required to serve in the military, the Haredi exemption, \u201cwhile relying on disproportionate government subsidies,\u201d has fostered significant resentment among non-Haredi Jews,\u00a0according to the Israel Policy Forum. The issue came to a head after Israel invaded Gaza following Hamas\u2019 October 7 attack, when the IDF initiated the largest mandatory military mobilization since the 1973 Arab-Israeli war. Some lawmakers in Netanyahu\u2019s own coalition have joined the opposition in pushing for the Haredi community to enlist. Despite the court ruling, the military is unlikely to immediately call-up all draft-age Haredi men. The Attorney General\u2019s office said the IDF \u201chad committed to recruiting 3,000 yeshiva students in the current recruitment year.\u201d Amichai Milici, a 45-year-old army veteran and father of seven who now studies full-time at a yeshiva, said the IDF isn\u2019t ready to absorb more ultra-Orthodox men yet. \u201cThey don\u2019t have synagogues (in the military), they don\u2019t have places to learn the Torah, there are girls all over the place,\u201d he told CNN, adding that some fear that enlisting would make the Haredis less religious. \u201cThe people are afraid\u2026 When they go to the army, who says they are going to be religious after that? After three years, he ain\u2019t going to be with kippah.\u201d He insists that any man who wants to study the Torah should remain exempt from military service, arguing that religious studies and the defense of Israel are intertwined and essential for the nation\u2019s well-being. \u201cThe study of the Torah is central to the existence of the Jewish people,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Jewish need the army and need the Torah\u2026 The Torah is giving power to the soldiers, and the soldiers are giving power to the Torah.\u201d Rabbis losing influence Many fear that mass enlistment could change the way of life in their insular neighborhoods. Farber, the Haredi journalist who once served in the IDF, said ultra-Orthodox rabbis may be worried about losing their influence. \u201cThe Haredi leaders, spiritual leaders\u2026 are very, very afraid that they are going to see thousands of young Haredi boys in uniform in (ultra-) Orthodox neighborhoods,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are afraid that being a soldier in the Haredi community will become something normal. And if you go into the IDF, you (might) start getting different ideas,\u201d he said. \u201cYou start opening your head to other opinions\u2026 and nobody\u2019s going to listen to the rabbis anymore.\u201d Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party said in response to the Supreme Court ruling that it hoped to pass a \u201chistoric conscription law\u201d which would \u201csignificantly increase the recruitment rates\u201d of ultra-Orthodox men but also \u201crecognize the importance of Torah study\u201d \u2014 raising the possibility of the exemption continuing for a smaller number of yeshiva students. But a source in the political opposition told CNN they did not believe any bill on the matter that could secure the necessary majority support in the Knesset would be acceptable to Netanyahu\u2019s ultra-Orthodox coalition partners, for whom this was the \u201cnumber one issue.\u201d \u201cIn terms of legislative process (we are) stuck,\u201d the source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss sensitive political matters candidly, said. \u201cI\u2019d be surprised if they (the Ministry of Defense) forcefully tried to recruit people against their will, even though it\u2019s the law. But it puts them in a very difficult spot now because the court ruling was so clear.\u201d The source said it was unclear what would happen to draft-dodgers. Prison is the final step in a process that starts with denying passport issuances and holding back benefits. \u201cSo it could be that we see that sort of process for a large number of ultra-Orthodox men. How much that impacts their lives, I don\u2019t know.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/middleeast/ultra-orthodox-in-israel-defy-orders-to-serve-in-military-mime-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "travel_avoid-stupid-american-stereotype-traveling-abroad", "text": "If you watch shows such as \u201cEmily in Paris,\u201d you can be forgiven for thinking the world is enchanted by Americans who travel abroad. Silly gaffes, like mistaking a public urinal for a monument and taking selfies in front of it, come across as charming quirks on television. However, as a single American woman who moved to Europe and made a LOT of faux pas of my own, I can assure you that the real world is definitely not amused. It\u2019s a hard pill to swallow, but sadly, we\u2019ve gained a reputation around the world for being, well, \u201cstupid Americans.\u201d Is it offensive? Yes. Could we get upset about it? Sure. But with tens of millions of Americans traveling abroad every year, the likelihood is that you\u2019ll encounter us wherever you are in the world. Therefore, our reputation is completely understandable. The reality is, we ALL do \u201cstupid\u201d things, especially when we are in foreign places and we don\u2019t know the local customs, cultures or surroundings. No one is immune from this humiliation, not even genius scholars. However, smart travelers know that doing \u201cstupid\u201d things abroad can not only be disrespectful and embarrassing, but it can put you at risk of being arrested, hurt or the victim of crime. That\u2019s why, instead of letting labels upset me, I choose to focus on how I can become a master traveler. After 20-plus years of exploring the world, I think I\u2019ve managed to crack it. So, here are my top 10 tips on how you can avoid the \u201cstupid American\u201d stereotype and become a \u201cSmart American\u201d abroad. Read social cues People in most countries are extremely polite. They would never tell you that what you are doing is offensive or socially unacceptable. Instead, they will most likely smile and nod, before quickly changing the topic, running away or ghosting you. This behavior definitely makes for a very civilized society, but if you\u2019re a tell-it-like-it-is New Yorker like me, it can be very hard to pick up on social cues. For years, I foolishly thought that what I was saying or doing was of genuine interest to those around me. I had no idea that I was embarrassing myself and chasing people away. As you meet people abroad, try to notice if they are genuinely interested (for example, asking lots of follow-up questions, making eye contact, building on your stories, asking to join in, etc.), or if they are just being polite. If your Spidey sense starts to tingle, it\u2019s probably time to change the subject or move on to a new activity. Keep the volume down It is very true that most Americans have a wonderful zest for life. We don\u2019t think twice about gabbing away with friends (or strangers) on public transportation or laughing whole-heartedly at the dinner table. That\u2019s just our way of being friendly. However, in many places around the world, speaking loudly is considered extremely rude and highly uncommon. It\u2019s not unusual to visit major cities and see people traveling in complete silence while on a packed train. You\u2019ll also notice that you can\u2019t hear the conversation at the table sitting directly next to you in a restaurant. When I first moved to Europe, people would regularly ask, \u201cWhy are you shouting?\u201d I was always shocked. I was just using my normal speaking voice! I didn\u2019t think I was being loud at all. Turns out, I was indeed shouting, at least relative to everyone else around me (imagine how traumatized they\u2019d all be if I did actually shout.). Over the years, I\u2019ve learned to become more aware of my surroundings and to control my volume level accordingly. It\u2019s a skill I will always struggle with, as my default level is apparently a nine out of 10 to most, but it\u2019s also a skill that has had a major positive impact on my business, romantic and personal relationships. Don\u2019t get me wrong, when I\u2019m home in New York, I let it all out and no one even notices. However, when I\u2019m traveling abroad, I\u2019m always careful to keep it to, what feels like, a quiet whisper. Blend in Normally, I\u2019m all for originality and standing out in a crowd. However, when you\u2019re traveling abroad, even to a place you know well, standing out is like wearing a flashing sign that says, \u201cI\u2019m a tourist, come take advantage of me!\u201d Whether it\u2019s pickpockets, grifters or someone more nefarious, there are always bad actors lurking about, looking for fresh prey. Unfortunately, criminals can often spot an American a mile away by either their accent (another reason to keep the volume of your voice down) or their fashion (khakis, golf shirts, sneakers, baseball hats and white socks are usually dead giveaways.) The moment these predators know you\u2019re from out of town, they will pounce. That\u2019s why it\u2019s smart to blend in with the locals and avoid drawing any sort of attention to yourself. Not only will it make you a smart American, it\u2019ll also make you a safer American.\u00a0 Be curious No one likes a know-it-all. That\u2019s why one of the best ways to win people over and skyrocket your knowledge is to be curious. Be a sponge and absorb as much new information as possible. Being genuinely interested in a country, its people, its culture and everyday life is one of the most flattering ways to show respect and connect with a community. Judge Judy always says, \u201cYou have two ears and one mouth for a reason.\u201d In other words, listen twice as much as you talk. \u00a0If you can listen without feeling the need to talk about \u201chow we do things back home\u201d or show off all the things you read in a book, then you will make friends everywhere you go. In fact, the more questions you can ask, the more people will think you\u2019re intelligent! No one expects you to know everything. It\u2019s attractive when you can say, \u201cI don\u2019t know about this, please tell me more.\u201d It shows humility and opens the door for others to share their wisdom and stories with you, which will always help you grow. So, try to forget everything you know, open your mind and be curious. If you do, people will respond with kindness, appreciation and believe that you are very wise. Be street smart Every city has its own scams, and it\u2019s important for you to read up on what the most common scams are in the area you\u2019re visiting before you travel so that you can be street smart. One of the most popular scams is when a taxi driver takes the \u201clong way\u201d to get you to your destination, racking up quite the bill. Not every city has Uber. Local taxi drivers instantly know whether you\u2019re from the area or not, simply by the way you make your request when you enter their vehicle. When I traveled to Rome for the first time, I got into a cab and asked the driver, \u201cHow much to get to this hotel?\u201d He replied \u201c80 euros.\u201d I immediately told him to stop. I removed my bags, which made him very angry, and exited his car. I then called the hotel and asked, the same question. They told me it would be no more than 5 euros. The next taxi I entered, I told the driver, \u201cPlease take me to this hotel. It\u2019s just down the road so should only be around 5 euros, right?\u201d He replied, \u201cYes,\u201d and we were on our way. By letting him know I wasn\u2019t a \u201cstupid American,\u201d we were all able to live happily ever after. The point of this story is do your homework. Get an idea of prices for taxis, food, charges, tipping, etc., ahead of time so you don\u2019t get ripped off or taken advantage of. Know the local scams and know how to reject people who approach you with their games. And most of all, don\u2019t let your excitement to be in a new place lure you into a false sense of security.\u00a0 Be careful about meeting new people, especially from dating apps. Stranger danger is real. Read the news America is so vast that the news tends to focus on what\u2019s going on locally in each state, with a touch of what\u2019s happening across the rest of the country. However, it rarely features international news. As a result, many Americans often have little to no knowledge of what\u2019s going on around the world, thus unfairly adding to the \u201cstupid American\u201d stereotype. Luckily, there is a fast and easy remedy. If you\u2019re planning to travel abroad, simply read the news headlines of the country you\u2019re visiting before you travel. You don\u2019t need to know the country\u2019s full history, but it will help tremendously if you know the basics: Who is the current president / prime minister of the country? What are the hot topics and major headlines? What is the country\u2019s national sport and how is their team doing? Where is the country located on a map, and what countries surround it? Having this information available at your fingertips will not only make you look well-informed, it will help you avoid being left out of conversations. Learn some of the language Do you need to be fluent when you go abroad? Not at all. Do you need to learn the basics? Yes. Absolutely. Most major cities will have plenty of English speakers, but they won\u2019t always be around when you need them. Whether it\u2019s an emergency or just being able to order from a menu, it\u2019s important for you to know some basic words and phrases to get you through the day. I recommend you start with: \u201cHello,\u201d \u201cGoodbye,\u201d \u201cThank you,\u201d \u201cPlease\u201d, \u201cHelp,\u201d \u201cSorry,\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t speak ___,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m allergic to ___,\u201d \u201cI would like to go to ____,\u201d \u201cWhere is ___\u201d and a smattering of your favorite foods. Sure, there are apps that can help, but memorizing these phrases will go a long way, not just with communication but also with cooperation. Even if you butcher the words, most people deeply appreciate it when you at least try to speak the local language. It shows respect that you made the effort, and you\u2019ll be surprised at how many doors it can unlock for you. Be an ambassador In many ways, we are all mini-ambassadors of the United States when traveling abroad. For better or worse, how we act will directly reflect, not just on us, but on all Americans. Yet, there\u2019s something in human nature that makes many people act differently when traveling abroad. It\u2019s as if something snaps inside their brains and, suddenly, they become this completely different person who can do and say things they would never consider doing in their daily lives. As you can imagine, this can lead to some bad situations (I\u2019m talking to you, Americans who were arrested for sleeping in the Eiffel Tower). While it might be tempting to take on a \u201cWhat happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas\u201d attitude when traveling abroad, I recommend you think of travel as if you are a sporting fan who is going to see your favorite team at an away game. You are a guest in their house. You can\u2019t expect the other team to have the same food, entertainment, transportation and hospitality. Your support for your team can be an automatic insult to the host team (even if you don\u2019t intend it to be insulting), and if you don\u2019t follow the rules, you\u2019re going to get kicked out of the stadium. But what brings us all together is that we all share a love of the sport. \u00a0It\u2019s the same with travel. Remember, you are a guest. Like any good visitor, you want to make sure you make a positive impression so that you are always welcomed back. Don\u2019t pack a lot of underwear One of the funniest stories I\u2019ve ever heard came from a friend who is a Swedish trumpet player. He roomed with an American while on tour. He said, the man opened his luggage and exposed over 50 pairs of underwear. The trumpet player asked, \u201cWhy have you packed so many pairs of underwear for a two-week tour?\u201d The musician replied, \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure if you had washing machines in Europe.\u201d Stories like this are amusing to us, but my friend was beside himself. Do Americans really think that Europe is backward? Well, apparently, some do. If you\u2019re traveling abroad, you may be surprised to know that many countries are far more advanced that the United States in some areas. For example, there has been a high-speed 200 mph train connecting London to Paris since 1994. Yet, America still doesn\u2019t have a high-speed train network of its own. Britain and most of Europe has been using contactless card payments for everything from dining to transport since 2007. Gothenburg, Sweden, is so safe that companies display actual products in front of billboards, and no one steals the items. The list goes on.\u00a0The point here is, for most travel, you won\u2019t need to pack 50 pairs of underwear. Beat them to the punch with humor My biggest secret weapon against being called a \u201cstupid American\u201d is calling myself a \u201cstupid American\u201d first and laughing about it. Let me explain. As I said above, I accept that everyone does stupid things, and I am no exception. I\u2019ve done a LOT of really \u201cstupid\u201d things when traveling in the past, and I\u2019m sure I will do plenty more \u201cstupid\u201d things in the future. That\u2019s OK! I know in my heart that I\u2019m not actually a \u201cstupid\u201d person. So, instead of getting offended or upset about it, I just laugh and get others to laugh with me. For example, whenever I don\u2019t understand something, I\u2019m confident enough to say, \u201cSorry, I know I\u2019m being a stupid American here, but could you help me with this?\u201d I find this approach instantly disarms people. Instead of becoming frustrated, it makes them eager to help. Instead of driving a wedge between our cultures, it brings us closer together. By beating them to the punch and stating the phrase \u201cstupid American\u201d before they even have a chance to think it, it flips the script and delivers a bit of reverse psychology that makes people think and say, \u201cNo, you\u2019re not stupid. I\u2019m happy to help you.\u201d At the very least they will laugh with you, not at you. Don\u2019t believe me?\u00a0 Notice how I used this same technique with you at the beginning of this article. Believe me. Implement this tip and no one will ever roll their eyes or doubt your intelligence ever again.

Ian underwent a process called \u201crapid intensification\u201d \u2013 where wind speeds increase dramatically in a short period of time due to warming ocean temperatures. The monster storm was packing sustained winds of over 155 miles per hour, and would become one of the costliest natural disasters in United States history. Early forecasts predicted Ian would be a direct hit to the Tampa Bay area. That\u2019s where Littlefield and his partner, Rebecca Van Fossen lived, and kept their boat, a 44-foot cabin cruiser named the Elizabeth Pearl. As Ian grew larger and more intense, their marina issued an emergency evacuation order. David was forced to move the boat to safer waters. It didn\u2019t turn out that way. \u201cThey were saying, if you\u2019re in Tampa, you need to watch out.\u201d Littlefield recalled, \u201cYou go north, or you go south. I went south \u2026 to Fort Myers.\u201d As David headed south, the Elizabeth Pearl lost its generator and, with it, his ability to charge his phone. He was cut off from nearly all communication and had no way to know that Hurricane Ian had changed course. Like David, Ian was now also headed to Fort Myers. Rebecca Van Fossen said the family had no way to reach him: \u201cWe\u2019re all on pins and needles. The whole family\u2019s like \u2018Have you heard from Dave? \u2026 No, I haven\u2019t heard from Dave, but I\u2019ve called him probably a hundred times.\u2019 It\u2019s not answering.\u201d The morning Ian hit, David was anchored in the Pine Island Sound, off the coast of Fort Myers. The skies and seas quickly went from calm to dangerous. \u201cThe wind was blowing so hard, and the waves were so high. And all of a sudden, wind and waves, hurricane force, blow the boat over on its starboard side. It rolled at 90 degrees.\u201d Littlefield recalled. \u201cI look in the engine room and there\u2019s a big hole in the side of the boat. And water starts coming in. Electronics are now submerged, and they short out, and now there is smoke \u2026\u201d Trapped in the boat\u2019s cabin, David faced the reality that the only two doors outside were both underwater. He was in trouble. \u201cHow am I going to get out?\u201d Littlefield said. He made his way to a window and kicked it out. He put on two life jackets \u2013 reasoning that \u201cif one life jacket is good, two must be better.\u201d He also grabbed a personal locator device called an EPIRB, an Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon. It\u2019s a small electronic device equipped with GPS, that when activated, sends a signal to help search and rescue teams locate people in distress. \u201cI flip on my EPIRB, and now it\u2019s transmitting.\u201d Littlefield said. \u201cI squeeze out the window and I\u2019m on the side of the boat that\u2019s out of the water. I\u2019m exposed to the full force of the hurricane.\u201d Clinging to the side, Littlefield and his boat are being battered by the storm. \u201cA wave would come and slam me in the back and then it would recede, and you\u2019ve got 150 mph winds.\u201d Littlefield said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m hearing the boat break up behind me, absolutely heartbreaking.\u201d As a pilot, Littlefield knew rescue missions aren\u2019t normally flown during the height of a hurricane, especially at night. He calculated there would be five hours to dark and 12 hours to light before he had any chance for a rescue. Littlefield worried: \u201cI wonder if I can do this for 17 hours?\u201d At midnight, a four-person helicopter rescue team from Coast Guard Air Station Clearwater was alerted to a distress signal from a vessel stranded off the coast of Fort Myers. \u201cSometimes we don\u2019t fly during the hurricane\u201d, USCG Rescue Swimmer, Jethro Hauser, said. \u201cIt\u2019s too dangerous. But people started calling in and we had to go.\u201d Hauser described the treacherous journey: \u201cYou would just start seeing explosions, and it was the electrical transformers blowing up. It was crazy. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it.\u201d\u00a0 The flight crew went to the last known position of the EPIRB signal and proceeded to search, according to USCG Flight Mechanic Megan Howard, \u201cwe knew we were in the right area, we just had to find him.\u201d Littlefield\u2019s call was their second of what would become a long and harrowing weekend of rescues. Hauser recalls the moment they spotted the vessel, \u201cSomeone up front was like, \u201cI think there\u2019s a boat on its side up ahead.\u201d \u2026 you could clearly see someone crawling around on it. \u2026 That was our first glimpse of Mr. Littlefield.\u201d \u201cI hear helicopter rotors and here comes a Coast Guard helicopter,\u201d Littlefield says with relief. That\u2019s when he knew he\u2019d make it. Hauser was lowered into the water and made his way toward the partially submerged vessel. \u201cWe are good swimmers,\u201d Hauser said, \u201cbut Mother Nature is always stronger.\u201d USCG Pilot David McKinley watched as his crewmate secured the scene, \u201cJethro had to fashion\u2026 a repelling system out of some dock lines to safely get David down off the boat and into the water.\u201d\u00a0 Howard still smiles when she recounts the harrowing rescue. \u201cMr. Littlefield climbed in the basket and I hoisted him up to the cabin and I could hear him yelling out to me, \u2018Thank you. Thank you!\u2019\u201d she said. The gratitude Littlefield feels for his rescue team rings through his words: \u201cMother Nature, she is a force to be reckoned with. She took 150 people\u2019s lives, by the grace of God, I wasn\u2019t one of them. By the grace of God and the Coast Guard.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/30/weather/hurricane-ian-sea-rescue/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "world"}}

The 68 were transferred to Cairo, Egypt, on Thursday, Israeli authorities say. COGAT, the Israeli agency responsible for approving aid into Gaza, coordinated the passage along with the Israeli military, the US, Egypt and the World Health Organization (WHO). The news provided a moment of relief for the parents, whose children who had been unable to access lifesaving care after more than eight months of Israeli bombardment in Gaza.  \u201cIt was a tough time for us in northern Gaza, nine months of exhaustion, displacement,\u201d Samira Al-Saeedi, whose six-year-old daughter Jouri was evacuated, told CNN earlier this week. \u201cPeople started stealing just to eat\u2026 Sick children cannot withstand famine.\u201d CNN footage from Nasser Hospital on Tuesday showed another evacuee \u2013 five-year-old blood cancer patient Yasmin \u2013 squirming in pain, her emaciated limbs sprawled on a teal mattress. \u201cShe is suffering and moving between hospitals receiving blood treatments\u2026 Every day she feels more pain than the day before,\u201d said her mother Umm Ubaida. \u201cShe is extremely tired. She can\u2019t wait any longer.\u201d The evacuations come with the southern Rafah crossing, a key transit point, still closed despite negotiations on its re-opening. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus welcomed the evacuation on Friday. He appealed for increased medical passage \u201cvia all possible routes including Rafah and Karem Shalom, to Egypt, the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and from there to other countries when needed.\u201d But as Israel\u2019s siege persists \u2013 and the risk of famine grows \u2013 Palestinian officials have warned that the operation was \u201ca drop in the ocean\u201d compared to hundreds more severely ill children who are still trapped in the ravaged enclave. More than 25,000 sick people require urgent treatment abroad, according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza. Among those are 980 children with cancer \u2013 including 250 patients who could face \u201ccertain death\u201d\u00a0\u2013\u00a0the ministry reported on Friday. Israel\u2019s military campaign has depleted the medical system and drained food supplies. Israel insists there is \u201cno limit\u201d on the amount of aid that can enter Gaza, but human rights agencies warn that its rigid inspection regime on trucks, sustained restrictions on land crossings and relentless bombing campaign means relief is barely dripping in. Israel launched its military offensive in Gaza after the Hamas-led October 7 attacks on southern Israel, in which at least 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 others were abducted. Israeli attacks in Gaza have since killed\u00a037,718\u00a0Palestinians and injured another\u00a086,377\u00a0people, according to Gaza health officials. \u2018I was not allowed to leave with them\u2019 Even before the war, chronically ill patients in Gaza faced numerous hurdles when trying to access medical treatment abroad \u2013 having lived through years of partial blockade imposed by Israel and Egypt. Ahead of the planned evacuation on Thursday, parents described days of arduous travel from the northern Kamal Adwan Hospital to the south. Several said their children were malnourished and dehydrated after suffering for months without enough access to food, water or medication \u2013 compounding the severity of their symptoms. Other family members claim they were not given approval to accompany their children. Even those allowed to travel did not know when they could leave \u2013 telling CNN they had been stuck for days inside a room in Nasser Hospital without windows. Shadi Mustafa Hussein Yassin, displaced from Nuseirat, central Gaza, is worried for the fate of his 11-year-old Son, Siraj, who was evacuated on Thursday with his mother and two brothers. He told CNN that Siraj, a blood cancer patient, requires a sample from him for a marrow transplant \u2013 but he was forced to stay behind. \u201cI submitted a request to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital to travel with them. They said you cannot travel because you are less than 60 years old.\u201d CNN has reached out to WHO for comment.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/28/middleeast/israel-gaza-medical-evacuation-palestinian-children-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "world"}}

The attack damaged critical infrastructure, as well as a retail store and residential buildings, he said Saturday. Ukraine\u2019s Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said trade pavilions, households and vehicles also caught fire as a result. Speaking to the National Police, one local resident who witnessed the strike said: \u201cIt was a weekend, everyone was having a rest \u2026 it wasn\u2019t even late, it wasn\u2019t dark, a missile hit.\u201d She continued: \u201cChildren died, children were injured. So did adults. For no reason. The children had a graduation party, they were graduating from school. They were planning their future.\u201d Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky offered his condolences to those who lost loved ones in the attack and appealed for more long-range weapons, saying Ukraine needs \u201cto strike with real long-range capability and to increase the number of advanced air defense systems in Ukraine.\u201d \u201cI am grateful to all partners who are helping. And the decisions we need must be accelerated. Any delay in decisions in this war means losing human lives,\u201d he wrote on Telegram. Recent battlefield developments have seen Russia make slow but steady tactical gains along multiple fronts in Ukraine. Russia also launched a surprise cross-border assault in May. In the Donetsk region, Russia has made advances towards Chasiv Yar as it attempts to capture the strategic hilltop town. During its offensive Russia has been exploiting Ukraine\u2019s weak spots including thinly stretched manpower and delays in western supplies. As Zelensky repeats his appeals for more long-range weapons, these developments have again highlighted Ukraine\u2019s\u00a0reliance on ammunition and weapons\u00a0from the United States and other allies. Concerns have been raised over how long aid from the US will continue should former US President Donald Trump be reelected this November. Thursday\u2019s debate saw US President Joe Biden struggle, while Trump questioned continuing to fund\u00a0Ukraine\u2019s fight against Russia. A Ukrainian politician, Oleksiy Goncharenko, told CNN that Trump\u2019s comments on the war in Ukraine were \u201cworrying.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re very concerned because we, more or less, understand what it means for\u00a0Ukraine, [a] Biden presidency, and we really don\u2019t know what it means for\u00a0Ukraine, a Trump presidency.

{"id": "2024_06_30_weather_hurricane-beryl-barbados-caribbean-sunday", "text": "Beryl, the first hurricane of the 2024 Atlantic season, intensified to an extremely dangerous Category 4 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 130 mph Sunday, as it made its way toward the Windward Islands. Beryl is now the earliest Category 4 hurricane on record in the Atlantic Ocean and the only Category 4 storm ever recorded in the month of June. Tropical storm-force winds are expected to reach the Windward Islands late Sunday or early Monday. The early timing of the season\u2019s first hurricane is unusual, given the average date for the first hurricane is August 11. As of 8 p.m. ET, Beryl was about 200 miles southeast of Barbados, heading west. \u201cA life-threatening storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 6 to 9 feet above normal tide levels in areas of onshore flow near where the eye makes landfall in the hurricane warning area,\u201d the National Hurricane Center said, adding that the surge could bring large and destructive waves near the coast. The hurricane is strengthening quickly, increasing 55 mph in the 24 hours before Sunday morning. \u201cWe\u2019re forecasting rapid intensification and expecting\u00a0Beryl\u00a0to become a major hurricane before it reaches places like Barbados and the Windward islands and continue to be a powerful hurricane as it moves into the eastern and central Caribbean as we go into the early portions of next week,\u201d hurricane center Director Mike Brennan told CNN\u2019s\u00a0Fredricka Whitfield on Saturday. The hurricane center defines rapid intensification as an increase in maximum sustained wind speed of 35 mph or more in a 24-hour period. Residents in places with hurricane warnings should be prepared for major storm impacts, Brennan said. Beryl brings a risk of heavy rainfall, destructive hurricane-force winds and dangerous storm surge and waves. Rainfall totals of 3 to 6 inches could bring localized flooding across the Windward Islands Sunday night and Monday, according to the center. Hurricane warnings are in effect for Barbados, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadine Islands, Grenada and Tobago. The hurricane is expected to produce 3 to 6 inches of rain across Barbados and the Windward Islands through Monday, the weather center said. Beryl\u2019s passage near the Windward Islands of Grenada and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines as a powerful Category 4 hurricane would make it the strongest storm there since Hurricane Ivan in 2004. Tobago was placed under a red-level warning \u2013 the highest public alert issued by the Trinidad and Tobago Meteorological Service \u2013 early Sunday evening, the agency said. The warning instructs the island\u2019s residents to take immediate action to protect their lives, livelihoods and property. \u201cShelter in place or evacuate to a safe location if your home is unsafe or vulnerable to flooding or wind damage,\u201d the agency said in a notice to the public. \u201cSecure food, water and medicine for at least 7 days in waterproof containers. Outdoor drains should be clear and loose objects secured by now. Sandbags should be near all entrances to your home.\u201d The Dominican Republic\u2019s government has issued a tropical storm watch from Punta Palenque westward to the border with Haiti ahead of Beryl, according to the hurricane center. A tropical storm watch has also been issued for Haiti\u2019s entire south coast, from the border of the Dominican Republic to Anse-d\u2019Hainault, the center\u2019s update stated. A tropical storm warning remains in effect for Martinique and a tropical storm watch for Dominica and Trinidad. Communities prepare for hurricane In Barbados, where the effects of Beryl are expected to be felt late Sunday, people across the island nation are making preparations. Barbados Prime Minister Mia Amor Mottley urged all non-essential businesses on the island to close by 8:30 p.m. Sunday. The center of Beryl is expected to pass about 75 miles south of the island sometime early Monday morning, The Barbados Meteorological Services said Sunday. The storm could bring hurricane-force winds, heavy rainfall, flash flooding and some severe thunderstorm activity. \u201cThe reality is that we do not want to put anybody\u2019s life at risk in this country,\u201d Mottley said in a video message Saturday night. Barbados, Grenada and Saint Lucia will close some of their airports Sunday night as Beryl approaches. Grenada\u2019s Maurice Bishop International Airport will close at 6 p.m. and is tentatively set to reopen on Tuesday at 10 a.m., a spokesperson for the Grenada Airports Authority told CNN. He noted the hours could change depending on the situation and officials will provide updates on their social media account, Spice Weather 473. In Barbados, the Grantley Adams International Airport announced it will close from 7 p.m. until further notice. The Hewanorra International Airport and the George F. L. Charles Airport in Saint Lucia will also suspend operations, according to the tourism authority. Barbados is still hosting cricket fans from around the globe who traveled to the island for the T20 World Cup, Mottley noted. \u201cOur visitors are here with us,\u201d she said. \u201cSome of them are not due to leave until Monday and Tuesday, and some of them have never gone through a hurricane or a storm before.\u201d She urged residents to provide support for those who aren\u2019t able to leave on Sunday, and to continue making hurricane preparations for themselves. CNN affiliate CBC Barbados reported large crowds and long lines at a local grocery store just after 7 a.m. People were also seen filling up their gas tanks Saturday. Some people were still relaxing on the beach Sunday, CBC reported. In Saint Lucia, a national shutdown will be in effect from 8:30 p.m. Sunday, Prime Minister Philip J. Pierre announced in a statement. Businesses and schools will remain closed on Monday, the prime minister said, urging the public to stay indoors until the all-clear is given. \u201cI encourage everyone to secure their property, identify and check on the vulnerable in your community and ensure that you have the necessary essentials to weather the approaching system,\u201d Pierre said. First hurricane of the season unusually early Beryl is the earliest\u00a0major hurricane \u2013 defined as one that is Category 3 or higher \u2013 in the Atlantic in 58 years. The storm\u2019s rapid intensification is very unusual this early into hurricane season, according to Brennan. It\u2019s rare for tropical systems to form in the central Atlantic east of the Lesser Antilles in June, particularly strong ones, with only a handful having done so, according to NOAA records. Beryl isn\u2019t just early for this hurricane season: It is now the Atlantic Ocean\u2019s third-earliest major hurricane. The earliest was Hurricane Alma on June 8, 1966, followed by Hurricane Audrey, which reached major hurricane status on June 27, 1957. The storm has already set the record for the easternmost hurricane to form in the Tropical Atlantic in June, beating a previous record set in 1933. The central and eastern Atlantic traditionally become more active in August, in part because ocean temperatures have had time to warm and fuel developing systems. This year, however, the Atlantic basin has seen above normal water temperatures and a lack of wind shear due to the transition from El Ni\u00f1o season to La Ni\u00f1a season, both of which are fuel for tropical development. \u201cBeryl\u00a0has found an environment with very warm ocean waters for this time of year,\u201d Brennan said. Warmer waters in the Atlantic Basin have given tropical storms and hurricanes the opportunity to develop at a more rapid pace in an more eastward position, according to Brennan, allowing storms to become more powerful and therefore more destructive earlier on in hurricane season, which runs from June 1 until November 30. \u201cThese are ocean water you\u2019d normally see like in August or September, but now we\u2019re seeing them in late June,\u201d Brennan said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of opening up more of the deep tropical Atlantic for formation before we get to what would be the traditional peak of the hurricane season.\u201d Caribbean islands urge public to prepare ahead of hurricane Authorities are urging residents to take precautionary measures, with several Caribbean nations under hurricane watches and warnings while Hurricane\u00a0Beryl\u00a0approaches and gains strength. Officials in Barbados say the island is expected to feel the impact of the storm as early as late Sunday night. Its meteorological service is anticipating storm-force winds, 3 to 6 inches of rain, \u201chazardous\u201d marine conditions and severe thunderstorms that may interrupt power utilities. \u201cAll the regular preparations that we do for a hurricane is in full swing,\u201d Minister of Home Affairs and Information Wilfred Abrahams said in a statement. \u201cWe have less than 48 hours until we expect to see the effects of this system impacting Barbados. Please use the time very wisely.\u201d In Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves warns that the storm could hit the islands by Monday morning as a Category 2 hurricane. The meteorological service forecasts sustained winds of 74 to 110 mph or greater and rainfall of 4 to 6 inches. \u201cKingstown is going to be flooded once this hurricane is on track,\u201d Gonsalves said of the capital city. \u201cNormally, two inches of rain \u2013 sustained rain \u2013 in a relatively short period of time will flood the city. Four inches will undoubtedly flood the city.\u201d In Saint Lucia, the government warns that the storm could bring \u201cmoderate to heavy showers, thunderstorms, and gusty winds\u201d to the region. Prime Minister Philip J. Pierre is advising residents to make necessary preparations and review their family emergency plans. In Grenada, the National Disaster Management Agency is also urging residents to prepare by having disaster supplies kits, trimming overhanging trees and branches, clearing drains and knowing where their emergency shelters are located. The island\u2019s officials declared a state of emergency Sunday evening ahead of the storm. Beryl is expected to impact the island early Monday, Grenada\u2019s Gov. General, Cecile La Grenade, said in a statement. All establishments will be closed except the police force, hospitals, prisons, waste disposal and ports. Tropical Depression Three forms in Gulf of Mexico As the trend of an active early Atlantic hurricane season continues, a new tropical depression has formed over the southern Gulf of Mexico in the Bay of Campeche. Tropical Depression Three is located about 185 miles east-southeast of Tuxpan, Mexico, and is moving west at 12 mph with maximum sustained winds of 35 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center. It is expected to strengthen into a tropical storm before it moves onshore in eastern Mexico overnight on Sunday. \u201cThe official intensity forecast calls for the system to become a tropical storm before landfall,\u201d the hurricane center said. \u201cAfterward, the circulation is very likely to dissipate over the mountainous terrain of eastern Mexico by Monday night.\u201d The government of Mexico has issued a tropical storm warning from Cabo Rojo south to Puerto Veracruz. Heavy rainfall totaling 4 to 8 inches across portions of eastern Mexico could result in flooding, with mudslides possible in areas of higher terrain, the center noted. The next name on the list of Atlantic storm names is Chris. NOAA predicts above-normal hurricane season Systems forming this early in the summer in this part of the Atlantic\u00a0is a sign of the hyperactive hurricane season to come, according to\u00a0research from\u00a0Phil Klotzbach, a hurricane expert and research scientist at Colorado State University.\u00a0Normally, ocean temperatures aren\u2019t warm enough in June and July to help tropical systems thrive. National Weather Service forecasters\u00a0predict 17 to 25 named storms this season, with eight to 13 of those becoming hurricanes, including four to seven major hurricanes. \u201cThat\u2019s well above average,\u201d Brennan noted. The weather service says that\u2019s \u201cdue to a confluence of factors, including near-record warm ocean temperatures in the Atlantic Ocean, development of La Nina conditions in the Pacific, reduced Atlantic trade winds and less wind shear, all of which tend to favor tropical storm formation.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/30/weather/hurricane-beryl-barbados-caribbean-sunday/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_28_world_a-third-of-sharks-are-threatened-with-extinction-heres-what-one-man-is-doing-to-help-iyw", "text": "Diego Carde\u00f1osa has loved sharks ever since he was a child.\u00a0The Colombia native was never afraid of them when he visited his beloved beach. Instead, he was fascinated with how sharks move through water using their multiple fins. It\u2019s no surprise he became a marine biologist. \u201cAs soon as I realized they were going through a conservation crisis, I wanted to help what I love the most,\u201d said Carde\u00f1osa. Sharks need him more than ever. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature reports 35% of all shark species are threatened with extinction. That number has grown nearly 50% in a decade\u2019s time. The primary reason is overfishing; shark meat and fins are highly sought. \u201cThey are being killed at a rate that cannot be sustained in the future,\u201d said Carde\u00f1osa. Scientists worry the sharks\u2019 dwindling numbers could bring ecological collapse as they play a number of key roles in the ocean. Unlike many fish, sharks take a long time to reproduce. Fisheries kill about 100 million sharks a year, according to the non-profit Save Our Seas. Many sharks end up as bycatch when long lines and gill nets unintentionally catch them. The largest demand that drives the international trade is shark fin soup.\u00a0\u201cShark finning is problematic because when you remove the fins from a shark and you put it back in the water, it\u2019s just like a rock or a log just falling to the bottom of the ocean,\u201d said Carde\u00f1osa. \u201cIf they cannot swim, they will suffocate to death.\u201d Hammerheads are one of the of the most critically endangered sharks- having lost 80% of their population in just the last three decades. \u201cTheir fins are big and really good quality,\u201d said the scientist. \u201cThat means they\u2019re thick and they have these cartilaginous filaments that are used in the shark fin soup.\u201d In recent years, demand has also risen for shark meat- a cheap protein consumed throughout Europe and South America. A small DNA tool makes a big difference Today Carde\u00f1osa is fighting the illegal trade of endangered sharks as a Distinguished Postdoctoral scholar at Florida International University in Miami. The marine biologist is using molecular and forensic tools to combat smuggling that stretches from Hong Kong to Latin America. One of the biggest challenges for law enforcement at ports around the world is determining whether shipments of shark fins and meat are violating CITES- The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. \u201cA lot of the fins look the same,\u201d explained Carde\u00f1osa. \u201cHow can you tell whether a shark fin that is coming into the country is legal or illegal, is from a species that is regulated or not regulated?\u201d Carde\u00f1osa, along with fellow FIU adjunct professor Demian Chapman, came up with a portable DNA kit that looks like a small red cube. It identifies species and country of origin of shark fins and meat coming into ports. \u201cWe take a little piece of this fin, we run it through a machine for two hours, and we\u2019re able to tell what species it is without sequencing very cheaply, very quickly.\u201d For years, port authorities were sending samples off-site to labs for testing that came back days if not a week later- slowing down the seizures. Their technology is now used in the shark trade\u2019s busiest ports: Hong Kong, Sri Lanka, Spain, Belize, Panama, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Brazil. Carde\u00f1osa said it has helped Hong Kong authorities go from seizing an average of five tons of shark fins annually before 2018 to one hundred tons since they started using the tool. His DNA toolkits have also helped stop illegal shipments of European eels and South America\u2019s matamata turtles, earning the marine scientist Interpol\u2019s Directorate of Criminal Investigation and Interpol medal. A decade of pounding pavement leads to international shark protections Carde\u00f1osa and a team of Hong Kong scientists have surveyed fish markets for a decade to determine the source of their shark meat and fins. Using DNA, they\u2019ve tested more than 15,000 samples in Hong Kong and mainland China and discovered a whopping two-thirds of what\u2019s being sold in those markets are from threatened shark species. \u201cWe\u2019re removing and trading some of the ones that are the most critically endangered in the ocean,\u201d said Carde\u00f1osa. That research has helped expand the number of shark species now regulated by CITES. Governments that sign on to the agreement must require permits for every shipment of shark products that moves through their ports, ensuring the trade is legal, traceable and sustainable. Carde\u00f1osa said when he got started in the field, there were only five or six shark species regulated by the CITES agreement. Today there are more than 150 sharks and rays covered. Carde\u00f1osa also discovered through genetic tracing that 85% of the fins at those markets belong to sharks caught in the Eastern Pacific, which stretches from Baja, California south through Central and South America to Peru- including Carde\u00f1osa\u2019s home country, Colombia. \u201cThe vast majority of the markets and the fisheries for sharks around the world are unsustainable, unmanaged, unregulated and sometimes illegal,\u201d said Carde\u00f1osa. The scientist is working with fishermen in South America \u2013 some of whom rely on fishing all kinds of marine life for their livelihoods. He\u2019s teaching them ways to fish sustainably \u2013 without dangerous long lines and gillnets \u2013 and how to protect known endangered shark populations. \u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do is to identify areas where those hammerhead sharks spend the majority of the time and make agreements with them to not fish those locations.\u201d Carde\u00f1osa says good management of shark fisheries \u201cis a really hard task to do. Everybody is trying to find a way to do it.\u201d He also enlists those local fishermen to help him. \u201cWe teach them how to collect data and bring them in as part of our projects to help.\u201d The shark scientist is also trying to convince more countries to sign on to the CITES convention on sharks. How you can help sharks One of the easiest ways to help sharks and all marine life is to try to consume seafood from sustainable sources. There are a number of online resources and apps for that including the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch. Just 4% of global shark catches are sustainable \u2013 so it\u2019s generally not a good idea to consume sharks. Additionally, their dense meat often contains a lot of mercury. \u201cThat will go to our lab and our programs to fund these projects and really have an impact on a global scale.\u201d You can also donate to the research Carde\u00f1osa is conducting through the FIU Foundation.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/28/world/a-third-of-sharks-are-threatened-with-extinction-heres-what-one-man-is-doing-to-help-iyw/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "world"}}
