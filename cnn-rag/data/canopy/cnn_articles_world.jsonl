{"id": "2024_06_05_middleeast_turkey-israel-hamas-war-politics-mime-intl", "text": "Since the war in Gaza began, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been one of Israel\u2019s harshest and most vocal critics \u2013 routinely branding it a terror state, comparing its prime minister to Hitler and heaping praise on Hamas. The Palestinian militant group is considered a terror group by most members of NATO, but not Turkey. Some Western critics might accuse Erdogan of going too far in supporting Hamas, but recent events suggest he has not yet appeased his domestic political base. After Erdogan\u2019s ruling party was handed a humbling defeat in local elections in March, he promised to think hard about what went wrong. Beyond the sputtering Turkish economy \u2013 many pundits blamed the electoral setback on his stance on Israel and its war in Gaza. Political challengers, like the smaller, ultra-conservative New Welfare party, managed to siphon off votes from the president\u2019s ruling AK Party by taking a tougher stance against Israel and demanding concrete actions beyond the fiery rhetoric Erdogan is known for. \u201cWe do not see (the government) doing anything other than speaking and condemning. There are no sanctions, no concrete steps taken, trade with Israel still continues,\u201d said New Welfare\u2019s leader Fatih Erbakan in March. The president may have believed that strong rhetoric against Israel was enough, Seda Demiralp, a political scientist at Isik University, told CNN after the election. \u201cErdogan really underestimated New Welfare and how much New Welfare could mobilize conservative voters.\u201d Correcting course After the election, Erdogan wasted little time correcting course, swiftly moving to match words with actions. In a matter of days, some trade with Israel was cut off. Three weeks later, all trade was cut off. Some $7 billion worth of annual trade \u2013 mostly Turkish exports \u2013 is now on pause until the war is over. That wasn\u2019t all. Last month, Turkey announced its intention to join the genocide case against Israel at the International Court of Justice. Already warm ties with Hamas were made even warmer when Erdogan hosted the group\u2019s political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Istanbul on April 20, and posed with him for pictures. Erdogan has compared Hamas to the \u201cKuvayi Milliye,\u201d the nationalist militias that fought against foreign occupation during the Turkish War of Independence after World War I. \u201cBelieve me, if it were 100 years ago, they would also call Kuvayi Milliye a terrorist organization, a rebel, a joke, a traitor,\u201d Erdogan said in a speech to party lawmakers in May, according to state broadcaster TRT. \u201cThis nation has always stood by the oppressed.\u201d The gap between how Turkey and its NATO allies view Hamas was on full, awkward display when Erdogan hosted Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis last month in Ankara. \u201cI don\u2019t see Hamas as a terrorist organization,\u201d Erdogan declared. \u201cOn the contrary, Hamas is an organization of resistance, whose territories have been occupied since 1947 and which has been defending its territories after the occupation\u2026 If you call them a \u2018terrorist organization,\u2019 it will upset us.\u201d \u201cWe can agree to disagree on this topic,\u201d Mitsotakis replied. Erdogan went on to claim that \u201cover 1,000 Hamas members are now under treatment in our hospitals in Turkey.\u201d A Turkish official with knowledge of the situation has since told CNN the president misspoke.\u00a0\u201cHe meant 1,000 Gazans are under treatment, who aren\u2019t Hamas members,\u201d the official said. Since the war began, the Turkish Ministry of Health has made several medical airlifts of injured Gazans and their family members to hospitals in Turkey. For Erdogan, \u2018Hamas is Palestine\u2019 Experts say the comment made by Erdogan in the presence of the Greek leader may have in fact been intended for an audience closer to home. \u201cWestern leaders right now are very aware that Erdogan is basically talking for his domestic audience and for the Muslim neighborhood,\u201d said Evren Balta, an international relations professor at Ozyegin University in Istanbul. Domestically, she said, the president has managed to link Hamas and the Palestinians to the point that \u201cwhen you are criticizing Hamas publicly, it is as if you\u2019re criticizing the Palestinian cause.\u201d That, coupled with the strong affinity the Turkish public has with Palestinians, has led politicians of all stripes to tread carefully on the issue, particularly some secular and nationalist opposition parties. \u201cFor Erdogan, Hamas is Palestine. For the opposition, Hamas is not Palestine, but they are having difficulties framing the political discourse,\u201d Balta said. At a political rally ahead of the March local elections, Ozgur Ozel, leader of the secular CHP party established by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of modern Turkey, highlighted his party\u2019s longstanding support for the Palestinian cause and sought to counter claims that he regards Hamas as a terrorist organization. \u201cI have not called Hamas a terrorist organization, but I have condemned its terrorist attacks,\u201d he said. \u201cI also condemned Israel\u2019s state terrorism.\u201d He then went on to taunt the president. \u201cNow come on, Erdogan. If you are on Palestine\u2019s side, stop the trade that your relatives, children, supporters and friends do with Israel every day.\u201d After the elections, Istanbul\u2019s CHP mayor Ekrem Imamoglu \u2013 widely touted as a future presidential contender \u2013 took fierce criticism from political rivals and in the Turkish press for branding Hamas as a terrorist organization in an interview with CNN in April. This was despite his harsh condemnation of Israel and its \u201cbrutal oppression\u201d of Palestinians. \u2018No influence\u2019 on NATO Turkey\u2019s NATO allies in the West have been quick to condemn Hamas, but they\u2019ve been largely silent on Ankara\u2019s cozy relations with the group. \u201cI think there is a degree of discomfort,\u201d about the relationship, said Fabrice Pothier, a former NATO policy chief, who now leads the Rasmussen Global political consultancy. \u201cIt is not benign, that there is one major ally that is far away from the others, but I think NATO manages \u2013 up to a point \u2013 to compartmentalize between the bilateral positions or issues of allies, and the NATO collective positions and issues.\u201d A case in point, in October, NATO leader Jens Stoltenberg told the German Press Agency that Turkey-Hamas relations are not a problem because \u201cin some ways it has no influence on what we do or don\u2019t do because we don\u2019t play a role in this particular conflict.\u201d Hamas members can freely come and go from Turkey and have a regular presence in the country. In fact, in December, Erdogan\u2019s chief foreign policy and security adviser, Akif Cagatay Kilic told CNN that Hamas\u2019 political leader Haniyeh \u201cmight have been\u201d in Turkey on October 7, the day the militant group led an attack on Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking 250 hostages. But he claimed that historically, Turkey\u2019s relationship with Hamas hasn\u2019t merely been tolerated by Israel, but has even been encouraged. He said former Turkish leaders \u201chave been asked \u2013 even by (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu \u2013 to engage with Hamas.\u201d Turkey\u2019s aim is to bring peace to the region, he said. \u201cWe\u2019re doing whatever it takes to achieve that.\u201d \u2018Inflation of mediators\u2019 Although it isn\u2019t officially a mediator in the Gaza conflict, there are indications that Ankara is involved on some level. In April, Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said Hamas was willing to dissolve its military wing if a Palestinian state was created within the 1967 borders. This was later confirmed by an Istanbul-based Hamas member, marking the first time the group has offered to lay down its arms. Fidan also helped relay messages between Washington and Tehran ahead of Iran\u2019s barrage of missiles fired at Israel in April, and there is some indication that Ankara may be playing a similar conduit role between Washington and Hamas. \u201cWe have been in touch with both the US and Hamas. We have been advising and encouraging both sides for an immediate and permanent ceasefire,\u201d a Turkish official told CNN \u2013 pointing to calls that Fidan held with both Haniyeh and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on the same day in mid-May. With Qatar mulling a possible exit from its mediation role, Balta says Turkey could potentially help fill the gap, despite its Hamas ties increasing distrust with Israel and the West. But, she says, the West would much prefer to deal with Turkey than with, say, Iran, which could become a future refuge for Hamas leaders if the group is forced to leave Qatar, where its political office is based. \u201cWestern governments know how to deal with Turkey\u2026 so when it comes to Middle Eastern conflicts, who else is going to be a reliable partner? Really, there are not many other reliable partners,\u201d she said. For now, Turkey isn\u2019t interested in playing a formal role in trying to bring an end to the war in Gaza. \u201cWe do not want to create an inflation of mediators,\u201d a Turkish Foreign Ministry source told CNN in April. Despite some discomfort with Turkey\u2019s close ties to Hamas, Western states, Pothier believes, figure it\u2019s better just to tolerate it. \u201cI think the West is finding it useful to have countries who can be between us and Hamas,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/middleeast/turkey-israel-hamas-war-politics-mime-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_06_travel_tokyo-disneysea-fantasy-springs-japan-intl-hnk", "text": "Tokyo DisneySea \u2013 the global brand\u2019s only ocean-themed park \u2013  has just unveiled its long-awaited expansion to the public. The new themed land, called Fantasy Springs, combines the worlds of three popular Disney movie franchises \u2013 \u201cPeter Pan,\u201d \u201cFrozen\u201d and \u201cTangled.\u201d Spanning 140,000 square meters and built at a cost of $2 billion (or 310 billion yen), it\u2019s the eighth \u201cport\u201d in DisneySea and is the park\u2019s largest expansion since opening in 2001. (The resort\u2019s original Tokyo Disneyland park \u2013 owned by Oriental Land Co. Ltd. \u2013 opened its doors in 1983 and was the first Disney park to be built outside of the United States.) A few Disney firsts Visitors to the new port first head through a tunnel passage made of rocks shaped like Disney characters from the three film franchises that inspired Fantasy Springs. Behind the waterfall at the entrance, called Magic Fountain, sits four new rides, a new hotel and eight new dining outlets (including three inside the hotel). One of the most anticipated additions inside Fantasy Springs is undoubtedly Rapunzel\u2019s Forest, Disney\u2019s first Tangled-inspired themed area. Visitors can tour the kingdom of Corona, visit the tower where Rapunzel lives and relive the love story between Rapunzel and thief Flynn Rider on a five-minute gondola ride called Rapunzel\u2019s Lantern Festival. The Snuggly Duckling, a tavern named for and designed like the speakeasy featured in the movie, serves the likes of cheeseburgers and German-style pancake desserts. Peter Pan\u2019s Never Land Adventure Elsewhere in Fantasy Springs, Peter Pan\u2019s Never Land Adventure is a new ride that allows visitors to join \u201cboy who never grows up\u201d alongside Tinker Bell and the Lost Kids on a quest to save John Darling \u2013 a main character in the 1953 movie  \u2013 from Captain Hook and his pirates. It isn\u2019t the first Peter Pan ride to appear in the Tokyo Disney Resort \u2013 Peter Pan\u2019s Flight can be found nearby at Tokyo Disneyland. But Disney promises guests won\u2019t suffer from deja vu; the new six-minute attraction \u201cseamlessly blends ride vehicle motion with show elements and all-new animation, including a groundbreaking projection system.\u201d The Peter Pan-themed area inside Fantasy Springs also offers a family-friendly buggy ride through Pixie Hollow, the fairy valley where Tinker Bell and her pals live. Naturally all of those \u201clost kids\u201d still need to eat. Chicken tenders and Pixi Dust soda can be found at the Lookout Cookout restaurant. Or, for something unusual, try the roast beef-flavored popcorn that\u2019s for sale onsite. Frozen Kingdom Frozen Kingdom, meanwhile, uses projection mapping technology to take guests on a journey with the film\u2019s famed sisters, Anna and Elsa. Throughout the six-and-a-half-minute ride, you\u2019ll have a chance sing along to all those hit songs that have haunted parents Spotify lists for the last decade, such as \u201cDo you want to build a snowman?\u201d \u201cFor the First Time in Forever,\u201d \u201cLove is an Open Door\u201d and, of course, \u201cLet it Go.\u201d Nearby, the Royal Banquet of Arendelle is a restaurant inside a replica of the grand Arendelle Castle and is decorated with books and artwork from the world of Frozen. A humbly named bakehouse called \u201cOaken\u2019s OK Foods\u201d serves an array of Scandinavian-inspired baked goods. For those who need a memory refresh, Oaken is the shopkeeper from Wandering Oaken\u2019s Trading Post and Sauna and appears in the 2013 Frozen movie. How to access and stay in the park A one-day Fantasy Springs Magic passport is currently included for guests buying one of Tokyo Disney\u2019s hotel vacation packages or available for purchase by those staying at the new Tokyo DisneySea Fantasy Springs Hotel inside the expansion. The hotel comprises two types of rooms: the 419-key Fantasy Chateau, and the more luxurious 56-room Grand Chateau. There are three dining outlets within the establishment, including a lobby lounge, an all-day dining restaurant inspired by all the Disney forests (from \u201cSnow White\u201d to \u201cSleeping Beauty\u201d) and French restaurant Le Rebellure. Guests not staying at a Disney hotel can obtain a standby pass or purchase a Disney Premier Access pass to enter Fantasy Springs, however, there is a visitor cap.

{"id": "2024_06_05_middleeast_israel-lebanon-cross-border-tensions-escalate-intl", "text": "Tensions are escalating on the Israel-Lebanon border as the Israeli military warned it was prepared to launch a large-scale attack in the north to deter the Iran-backed Islamist group Hezbollah. Cross-border attacks from Lebanon led to large fires blazing through Israel\u2019s northern region this week, consuming swathes of land and leading to the evacuation of residents. Israel attributed the blaze to rocket fire from southern Lebanon, where Hezbollah said it had launched a \u201cswarm of drones\u201d at Israeli military sites. On Wednesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the northern city of Kiryat Shmona\u00a0near the Lebanese border, saying that Israel is prepared for \u201cvery intense action\u201d in the north. \u201cWhoever thinks that they can hurt us and that we will sit idly by is making a big mistake,\u201d the prime minister said. \u201cOne way or another, we will restore security to the north.\u201d Netanyahu\u2019s comments come after Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi said the Israeli military is ready to attack targets in the north. \u201cWe are prepared after a very good process of training \u2013 up to the level of a military exercise \u2013 to move to an attack in the north. Strong defense, readiness to attack, we are approaching a decision point,\u201d Halevi said on Tuesday. Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon have been trading fire since the start of Israel\u2019s war on Hamas in Gaza in October. In April, the IDF said it is \u201cpreparing to move from defense to attack,\u201d referring to operations on the northern border. The Lebanese group has said its attacks on Israel are in protest to Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. Naim Qassem, Hezbollah\u2019s second-in-command, told Al Jazeera on Tuesday that Hezbollah is a front to support Gaza \u201cand that front doesn\u2019t stop until the war (in Gaza) stops.\u201d He said that the group\u2019s assessment was that recent threats from Israel were not serious. \u201cEither way, we have decided not to widen the battle and we do not want an all-out war. But if it is imposed on us, we are ready and we won\u2019t retreat,\u201d he said. The IDF says it has killed around 300 Hezbollah fighters, and Reuters reported that around 80 civilians have been killed in Lebanon by Israeli fire. Ten Israeli civilians and 18 soldiers have also been killed on the border, the Israeli military said. More than 94,000 Lebanese have been displaced from areas and towns close to the border with Israel since the conflict started, according to figures released Tuesday by the Lebanese Ministry of Public Health. More than 53,000 Israelis have been evacuated from the country\u2019s north since hostilities began in October, the IDF told CNN. \u2018Strategic trap\u2019 \u201cIsrael has been caught in a strategic trap up north,\u201d Amos Harel, a defense analyst, wrote in Israeli newspaper Haaretz on Wednesday. \u201cIt has proven unable to force Hezbollah into a cease-fire as long as the fighting in Gaza continues, whereas the Lebanese organization has managed to create a kind of \u2018security zone\u2019 devoid of residents inside Israeli territory, despite suffering much higher losses than the IDF has.\u201d On Wednesday, far-right Israeli Minister of National Security Itamar Ben Gvir said it was now the IDF\u2019s job to \u201csimply to destroy Hezbollah\u201d. \u201cIt cannot be that our land is being targeted and harmed, and people here have evacuated,\u201d he said on Telegram. \u201cAll Hezbollah strongholds must be burned and destroyed. War!\u201d Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said in an interview with Israeli radio station Reshet bet however that the IDF isn\u2019t interested in broadening the war to eliminate Hezbollah. The military is \u201ctelling us right now that it doesn\u2019t want to\u2026 launch an attack in the north, fight and defeat Hezbollah, and overwhelm it and create a security zone.\u201d Amid an uptick in tensions on the border, senior Israeli minister Benny Gantz, a member of the war cabinet, has said that the country cannot afford to lose another year in the north. \u201cI have been fighting for months with the government, with the prime minister and with everyone, that by September 1 we will finish the job here and be able to start something else. It will happen with either a solution or escalation, but we can\u2019t lose another year here,\u201d he said. Last month, Gantz threatened to leave the national unity government unless a six-point plan was agreed by June 8 that included the return of residents displaced by attacks from Lebanon. An Iran-backed Islamist movement with one of the most powerful paramilitary forces in the Middle East, Hezbollah has opened another front against Israel. The group is seen as Iran\u2019s most effective non-state partner, possessing 150,000 rockets that could overwhelm Israel\u2019s defenses if an all-out war breaks out. A wider conflict could also draw Iran and the United States into the war. Israel and Iran came close to war in April after launching unprecedented direct attacks on each other\u2019s soil. \u201cNot only is there no military solution on the horizon (in northern Israel), but the time that\u2019s passed has led many to consider leaving the area permanently, especially with a new school year due to open in September,\u201d Harel wrote.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/middleeast/israel-lebanon-cross-border-tensions-escalate-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_25_style_zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk", "text": "Above Beijing\u2019s imperial center rises Jingshan, or Prospect Hill. From a pagoda at its modest peak, a panoramic view of the city presents itself. To the south, the dull golden roofs of the Forbidden City crest and fall, pulling the eye southward to Tiananmen \u2014 the Gate of Heavenly Peace \u2014 and the vast square of the same name just beyond. To the east stand the smooth metallic skyscrapers of the city\u2019s business district. To the north, at the top of Beijing\u2019s central axis \u2014 its so-called dragon\u2019s vein \u2014 sit the Bell and Drum Towers, which once acted as the city\u2019s collective timepiece. And stretching all along the western periphery are the calm, tree-lined waters of the manmade lakes, dug by hand for the pleasure of past emperors. It\u2019s this aerial view of \u201cZhongnanhai,\u201d meaning \u201cmiddle and southern seas,\u201d and the surrounding buildings that today\u2019s Chinese leaders prefer you did not see. That\u2019s because the 1,500-acre site of repurposed imperial pavilions and temples, along with gray modern offices has formed the leadership compound for the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP)  since 1950. As the seat of power, Zhongnanhai is often thought of as China\u2019s equivalent to the White House, or the Kremlin. Synonymous with China\u2019s communist party elite, and among the country\u2019s most secretive places, it is ringed by a centuries-old red ochre wall, with countless CCTV cameras periscoping above it \u2014 and patrolled assiduously by security forces in both plain clothes and uniform. A peaceful getaway For Chinese leader Xi Jinping\u2019s imperial forebears, the site served a somewhat different function. While emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties ruled their vast kingdom from within the Forbidden City, they built temples, halls and living quarters in Zhongnanhai; less grandly ceremonial than those of the palace, they were often oriented to take advantage of the views afforded by the area\u2019s tranquil waters and carefully planned gardens. Many of these emperors came to favor passing their days surrounded by drooping willows in the cool and quiet of this cultivated pleasure garden. A story relayed by the scholar Geremie Barm\u00e9 in his book \u201cThe Forbidden City\u201d tells of the 18th-century Qianlong Emperor\u2019s daily routine at Zhongnanhai: Each morning, after a first breakfast of cold swallows nest soup, he would travel by heated palanquin to the gardens\u2019\u00a0Studio of Convivial Delight,\u00a0a pavilion he built to capitalize on the view of the South Lake, where he would breakfast again on a meal of\u00a018 dishes. As the historian and author of \u201cThe Shortest History of China,\u201d Linda Jaivin, told CNN via email: \u201cThere is something outrageous and yet poetic about the incredible coordination and effort required of a team of bearers, cooks and attendants, just so that an emperor could come, catch a view of the magnificent Ocean Terrace, scoff his food and (leave).\u201d The first ruler to view Zhongnanhai as primarily a place to govern from, not simply relax in, was the Empress Dowager Cixi, who effectively controlled China for almost five decades from 1861. She lived for many years in the gardens\u2019 Hall of Ceremonial Phoenixes, which became the center of political authority in China. She would die there in 1908. The serene surroundings of Zhongnanhai also became, under Cixi, a place of punishment and confinement. In 1898, following attempted reforms that displeased her, Cixi imprisoned her nephew, the Guangxu Emperor, on Yingtai Island, which juts out into the southern lake. Built as a miniature version of the mythical Penglai island, home to the immortals of Chinese legend, the tiny piece of land would become the emperor\u2019s home for most of his life, bar a brief period when the Boxer rebellion of 1900 forced the whole court to flee the capital. He would die on Yingtai Island from arsenic poisoning the day before the Empress Dowager herself. His imprisonment and death, said writer M. A. Aldrich, author of \u201cThe Search for a Vanishing Beijing: A Guide to China\u2019s Capital Through the Ages,\u201d perhaps adds a touch of poignancy for any subsequent resident of Zhongnanhai. \u201cIn addition to being a site that preserves sites of imperial splendor,\u201d he told CNN, \u201cit also functions as a reminder to the political elite about the consequences for stepping out of line.\u201d For Aldrich, however, the Zhongnanhai compound also represents the destructive impulses of the CCP towards its adopted capital in the years after 1949, when Mao Zedong proclaimed the foundation of the People\u2019s Republic. \u201cAs a political symbol of the New China, it has been torn up, rebuilt, expanded, and revamped so many times that its connection with its elegant past has been lost,\u201d Aldrich said. Architectural changes There have been serious revisions to the architecture of Zhongnanhai since the end of imperial rule in 1912. After the last emperor abdicated the throne, China\u2019s new president Yuan Shikai granted him the right to live on the northern section of the Forbidden City \u2014 and then took Zhongnanhai to be his new administration\u2019s headquarters. The changes he made to the imperial gardens were disparaged by many of the Westerners who visited them. \u201cWhatever may be one\u2019s opinion as to whether Yuan Shikai \u2018exalted his aim\u2019 in his political career, he certainly cannot be said to have done so as builder and architect,\u201d wrote L.C. Arlington and William Lewisohn in their 1935 book \u201cIn Search of Old Peking,\u201d \u201cfor all the buildings that have been erected or restored by him are in the worst possible taste.\u201d Most notable of these changes \u2014 at least to ordinary Beijingers \u2014 was the repurposing of a two-story pavilion at the very south of the gardens. Known as the Precious Moon Tower, it had been built decades earlier by the Qianlong Emperor for a homesick lover, a Muslim woman from Xinjiang, taken to Beijing as part of the spoils of war. The concubine would gaze south from the tower toward a mock mosque and bazaar the emperor had especially constructed to assuage her longing for home. Yuan refashioned this pavilion into the main entrance to his presidential compound, and established a tall watchtower just to its east. The gate was named Xinhuamen, or the Gate of New China. Today, the structure remains coated in the same deep red that graces the walls of all Beijing\u2019s imperial buildings, with a roof of glazed yellow tiles and detailing that runs below the roofline, picked out in blue and gold. The gate is now flanked by two red banners that speak to its modern purpose as China\u2019s political and party headquarters: \u201cLong Live the Great Communist Party of China\u201d reads one; and \u201cLong Live the Invincible Mao Zedong Thought\u201d on the other. On a screen wall recessed behind the entrance way, Chinese characters written in Mao\u2019s own calligraphic style declare: \u201cServe the People.\u201d Facing out onto Beijing\u2019s main east-west thoroughfare, the gate remains the most conspicuous part of Zhongnanhai. The rest of the compound has, since 1989, been firmly off-limits to the Chinese public. Seat of power Initially, after the communist victory in China\u2019s civil war in 1949, Mao Zedong took up residence at Shuangqing Villa in Fragrant Hills, another former imperial garden to the west of Beijing. Though wary of establishing himself in the imperial heart of Beijing \u2014 it is said that he refused ever to enter the Forbidden City, for fear of being associated with the power structures of old, feudal China he had fought to overthrow \u2014 Mao ultimately moved into Zhongnanhai and, in late 1949, he set up in the\u00a0Garden of Abundant Beneficence,\u00a0a large courtyard compound favored by both the Qianlong and Kangxi emperors, where he would hold court with dignitaries\u00a0and live\u00a0until 1966. Having re-established Zhongnanhai as a center of political power in the new China, Mao set about rebuilding the compound according to his tastes. \u201cSince 1949, an assortment of new architecture styles has encroached into Zhongnanhai, with a tennis court, gymnasium, swimming pools and Western buildings topped off with Chinese eave roofs adding a discordant note that would not have been appreciated by its traditionally-minded original owners,\u201d said Aldrich. In 1966, Mao moved from the Garden of Abundant Beneficence to a specially built house beside his beloved indoor swimming pool. He often summoned officials to speak to him as he bobbed in the water \u2014 and famously received Russian leader Nikita Khrushchev at his pool during a 1958 visit. \u201cTheir interpreters had to pace alongside the edge of the pool,\u201d said Jaivin. \u201cThe Russian couldn\u2019t swim and had to wear water wings. Mao loved both swimming and putting Khrushchev in his place. Finally, Khrushchev got sick of it, and clambered out to sit on the edge, dangling his feet in the water.\u201d In the residence next door, Mao lined his rooms with bookshelves housing an extensive library of Chinese classical literature. \u201cIt was here,\u201d noted Aldrich, \u201cwith the background trappings of a scholar, that he met Nixon and Kissinger in 1972.\u201d Most subsequent leaders have preferred to keep a house outside the Zhongnanhai compound. Deng Xiaoping lived, from 1977, in a courtyard house on a nearby lane adjacent to Beihai, the \u201cNorthern Sea\u201d of central Beijing\u2019s chain of lakes. While not officially disclosed, it is believed that more contemporary leaders, including Xi Jinping and his predecessors Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, have maintained homes in an exclusive gated compound in Jade Spring Hill, sometimes called the \u201cback garden\u201d of Chinese politics, out to the city\u2019s west. Aldrich noted that those leaders and party cadres who used Zhongnanhai as their primary residence often attracted unwelcome scrutiny for their activities, particularly during years of political turbulence. \u201cIn his memoirs, Chairman Mao\u2019s physician, Li Zhisui, commented that (the complex\u2019s) residents were always under surveillance,\u201d Aldrich said. \u201cDuring the Cultural Revolution, the simple act of making a fire would bring down the wrath of the security guards on the perpetrator. It was believed that such a fire was proof that incriminating or seditious materials were being destroyed.\u201d The imperial gardens offering vistas of Zhongnanhai\u2019s lakes have, today, been filled in with dozens of gray offices and meeting halls, many of which date to 1970s, when Zhongnanhai underwent significant razing and renovation \u2014 the rebuilding was so extensive that one visitor in 1979 described the grounds resembling a construction site, with muddy roads that were impossible to walk on. The contemporary compound splits roughly in two, with the northern buildings, on the banks of the \u201cmiddle lake,\u201d used as the headquarters of China\u2019s top executive body, the State Council. It is here that foreign dignitaries are admitted. Around the \u201csouthern lake,\u201d meanwhile, are the headquarters of the CCP, including, within Qinzheng Hall (the Hall of Diligent Government), the offices of the general secretary of the party (a post currently held by Xi). Many of the most historically significant political events to occur at Zhongnanhai have taken place in Huairen Hall, or the Hall of Cherished Compassion, on the western side of the Middle Lake. The hall was added to the imperial park during the late Qing dynasty, but was then extensively remodeled by the CCP in the early 1950s to impart a more august socialist grandeur. It is a broad, imposing ceremonial hall with staggered roofs of glazed green tiles falling in curved lines to upturned corners; the facade of austere grey brick is interrupted by red wooden pillars, windows and doors. The building\u2019s capacious interior houses a large auditorium, as well as numerous smaller meeting rooms. The hall has, for decades, served as the main meeting place for China\u2019s Politburo, the party\u2019s decision-making body usually comprising about two dozen members. On occasion, it has also hosted the Politburo\u2019s Standing Committee, the core of China\u2019s political elite, (the power of both bodies has notably dwindled in the era of Xi), though they most commonly meet in Qinzheng Hall, close to the general secretary\u2019s office. During the tumult of the Cultural Revolution vital discussions and debates occurred at Huairen Hall, and, in the months after its conclusion, it was there that three of the so-called Gang of Four \u2014 the political faction that included Mao\u2019s wife held responsible for the worst excesses of the era \u2014 were arrested, tricked into attending a meeting they thought was about the publication of the fifth volume of Mao\u2019s Selected Works. In April 1989, former party head Hu Yaobang suffered a heart-attack during a Politburo meeting at Huairen; his death a week later would trigger the Tiananmen Square protests that the government forcibly cracked down on in early June of that year. However, the compound hasn\u2019t always been so forbidden for the masses following the collapse of China\u2019s imperial dynasty. In the late 1920s, it became a park, with tourists allowed to boat on and swim in the lakes, while in the 1980s, the public could access some of its scenic and historical spots, including\u00a0Mao\u2019s\u00a0former residence, on\u00a0organized weekend tours.\u00a0Even early in 1989, a journalist for the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0was able to casually\u00a0drive\u00a0a senior official into the compound and drop him off inside.\u00a0During a period of warmer US and China relations in 2011, former Chinese president\u00a0Hu Jintao\u00a0invited\u00a0a group of American high school students to Zhongnanhai. Modern security concerns Today, Zhongnanhai is more closely-guarded than ever, though the inexorable development of the city has caused problems in maintaining the compound\u2019s secrecy. When an annex to the nearby Beijing Hotel was built in\u00a01973, authorities were panicked by the realization that from its upper floors one could quite easily see \u2013 and potentially target a sniper rifle \u2013 into Zhongnanhai. A building was hastily erected on the western edge of the Forbidden City to restrict this view. Likewise in 2018, when Beijing\u2019s new tallest building was\u00a0completed\u00a0\u2013 the 528-meter Citic tower, better known as the \u201cZun\u201d \u2013 the country\u2019s national security apparatus reportedly requisitioned the top floors amid fears that visitors or occupants might be able to spy into the compound. Beijing authorities did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on the security situation at the time. Zhongnanhai\u2019s entrance, Xinhuamen, has also been the site of repeated demonstrations in recent decades; in 1989, it was a gathering point for students taking part in the Tiananmen protests, whilst in 1999, more than 10,000 members of the since-banned Falun Gong gathered on the sidewalks near Zhongnanhai to protest their treatment at the hands of the government. So, while Zhongnanhai is sometimes compared to the White House, Aldrich argues that the paranoia with which the compound is today guarded makes it more like the imperial palace of centuries past: \u201cSince ordinary people are not allowed to enter Zhongnanhai, it is probably more appropriate to describe it as a \u2018New Forbidden City\u2019 for China\u2019s ruling elite rather than a place with a personal political resonance for the average citizen,\u201d he said. \u201cHeck, even the Kremlin is open to tourists!\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/style/zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "world"}}

The announcement comes after US President Joe Biden unveiled executive action that would bar people who cross the US-Mexico border illegally from requesting asylum, during periods when there is a high volume of illegal crossings. Unless they meet certain exemptions, the asylum-seekers would be turned away to Mexico or returned to their home countries. The\u00a0president\u2019s proclamation, announced Tuesday, still allows for the normal flow of commerce and legal immigration across the border. Asked whether Biden\u2019s plan could lead to a potential increase of migrants on the Mexican side of the border, Mexico\u2019s president said, \u201cWe are seeking an agreement that if they (the US) make the decision to deport, they do so directly.\u201d L\u00f3pez Obrador added that he is not worried about Mexican border towns being overwhelmed by asylum seekers pushed back by the US. \u201cThey come to Mexico. We have no problem. We treat them all very well (\u2026) but why not a direct agreement?\u201d he said. Biden and L\u00f3pez Obrador also held a phone call on Tuesday, which the Mexican president described as \u201crespectful\u201d and \u201cvery amicable,\u201d saying they spoke about the need to support Latin American nations. A \u2018virtual wall\u2019 While some critics argue Biden\u2019s sweeping migration measure\u00a0doesn\u2019t go far enough in responding to the large numbers of people showing up at the US southern border, others warn that closing the\u00a0border\u00a0to\u00a0asylum\u00a0seekers\u00a0will endanger vulnerable people. In practice, the new rule would imply \u201cclosing the border\u201d to the thousands of refugees who are in Mexico waiting to reach the United States, Tonatiuh Guill\u00e9n, professor at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) and former commissioner of the National Migration Institute of Mexico, told CNN. \u201cIt implies a kind of virtual wall because people are going to be in a scenario where they are going to be rejected. On the other hand, if this measure is implemented, it leaves thousands of people without the possibility of shelter,\u201d Guillen said. Mexican authorities have largely played down any expected impact. A source at Mexico\u2019s asylum commission COMAR also told CNN that the agency is not very concerned about a potential increase in refugee applications \u201cbecause normally, the migrants who reached the northern border of Mexico are not interested in requesting asylum in Mexico.\u201d L\u00f3pez Obrador said what he \u201cliked the most\u201d about his call with Biden was the US\u2019 plan to build three new border bridges. \u201cThis is going to help a lot in the economic and commercial development throughout the region,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/americas/mexicos-us-deportation-country-of-origin-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "travel_new-beaches-open-paris-olympic-games", "text": "Lying on a sunny beach in France, occasionally sipping an ice-cold beverage, and then jumping into warm water. This must be the French Riviera, right? Or, actually, Paris. In an effort to transform how tourists experience summer in the French capital this July and August as it hosts the 2024 Olympic Games, the city is opening three beaches in its center, bringing a taste of St. Tropez and Nice to more northerly, urban shores. As usual, Paris will open its regular summer beach on the banks of the Seine river. But this year, it\u2019ll be joined by two more along the Saint Martin canal \u2013 a return of a regular fixture in the Bassin de la Villette cultural district plus a newer plage further along. Paris\u2019 city government confirmed to CNN it is confident that the water quality will meet health standards during the game. Pierre Rabadan, Paris deputy mayor in charge of sport and the Olympic games, said the city will deploy 30 testing sites along the Seine and its branches before it reaches Paris to monitor water quality in real time and quickly identify and handle potential pollution risks. For those who still might recoil at the idea of jumping in a city center waterway, there are other options. The beaches are the centerpieces of a program of activities in Paris aimed at creating an Olympic festival for visitors descending on the city during the 2024 summer Games. This has been revealed as Paris, traditionally one of the world\u2019s most popular tourist destinations, faces a potential struggle to lure visitors amid fears of overcrowding and overpricing during the Olympics. An alternative Paris Olympics, for everybody The 2 million-plus residents of central Paris have always had a strong sense of pride in the arrondissement, or district, that they live in. It\u2019s not unknown for residents of the 16th arrondissement and those of the 11th arrondissement to harbor subtle prejudices against each other. The city is planning to harness those rivalries in a \u201cDistrict Olympics\u201d that will pit the fastest, highest and strongest from each arrondisment to finally settle the debate of which neighborhood is best \u2013- at least in terms of sport. But these games are actually open to everybody aged seven and above. Which means you don\u2019t need to live in Paris to participate. All you need to do is pick an arrondissement you\u2019d like to represent. Participants will be separated into four age groups: 7 to 12, 13 to 16, 17 to 35 and those aged 36 or above. From June 22 to July 13, Parisians and visitors can compete in seven different sports: laser run (cross-country running combined with laser pistol shooting), 3x3 basketball, boccia (a Paralympic ball sport) table tennis, 60-meter run, breakdancing, and\u00a050-meter freestyle swimming. Olympic flames For those who just want to party and watch other people, professional or amateur, do the sport, Paris has you covered. The arrival of the Olympic flame to the French capital coincides with France\u2019s July 14 national day \u2013 and the city is throwing a huge party to celebrate. On the day, Parisians and visitors will be able to watch the torch relay at several city center locations. In Place du Colonel Fabien it\u2019ll be soundtracked by a DJ and at Petit Palais, right by the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es. French opera group D.I.V.A will provide the music. In the Paris LGBTQ district of Marais, a bingo drag event is being organized for the viewing party. For those who miss the flames in Paris on July 14 and 15, the torch returns to the French capital for the opening ceremony on July 26. This time the flame will journey down the Saint Martin canal to the opening ceremony on the Seine river, offering the potential of watching it from one of the new beaches. A marathon for all For runners, Paris is offering the chance to run the exact Olympic marathon route between the city center and suburban Versailles \u2013 said to be the first such event in the history of the Games. The event will take place on August 10, with an additional 10-kilometer route for less ambitious participants that will take runners past landmarks such as the Op\u00e9ra Garnier, Place de la Concorde and the Eiffel Tower. The full-length marathon is open to those aged 20 above while the shorter version is open to anyone aged 16 and above. Entry is via a lottery through the Paris Olympic Games app.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/new-beaches-open-paris-olympic-games/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_07_style_miss-universe-ecuador-oldest-participant", "text": " Ecuador\u00a0may have a 46-year-old woman representing the small Andean nation in the Miss Universe beauty pageant later this year. Yajaira Quizhpi \u2013 who represents the Sierra region \u2013 is vying for the national title of Miss Universe Ecuador. This Saturday, she and 24 other contestants will compete at the pageant\u2019s final in Machala, in the El Oro province. The winner will go on to represent Ecuador at the Miss Universe competition in Mexico in September. Quizhpi is the oldest woman in\u00a0the country\u2019s history to participate in the contest organized by the Miss Universe franchise. \u201cI feel proud to be allowed to be here. We have broken barriers and, as women, we can take a step forward without fear of what they will say,\u201d she told CNN en Espa\u00f1ol in a video interview. Her quest has only become a reality after the Miss Universe organization changed its rules related to age. Previously, contestants had to be between the ages of 18 and 28. As of 2024, there is no upper age limit. \u201cThe experience has been rewarding. It has enriched me personally. My husband and my son have supported me. My husband was the person who encouraged me to register and be part of this candidacy today,\u201d she added. Quizhpi is a chemical engineer who was born in Azogues, in the province of Ca\u00f1ar. She says fellow contestants have supported her and that the fear of criticism can be overcome with determination and sincere friendship. \u201cThey (other contestants) have received me with great affection, I have seen camaraderie, we have learned from each other, from positive and negative experiences. I thank my colleagues who have always been very fond of me. It has been a great life lesson,\u201d she said. Quizhpi isn\u2019t the only contestant who wouldn\u2019t have been able to participate before recent changes in Miss Universe\u2019s rules were introduced in 2023. For the first time in its more than 70-year-history, the franchise green-lit the participation of women who are married or divorced and who have given birth or are pregnant. Of the 25 contestants for Miss Universe Ecuador, seven participants are mothers \u2013 four are married and the other three are divorced. 29-year-old contestant Daysi Laman, who is divorced with three children, says the pageant is making great strides and expresses support for Quizhpi. \u201cShe is one of the most experienced colleagues, not only because of her age. She is a beautiful woman, a capable and intelligent human being. We get along well. I admire (her) bravery,\u201d she said in a video call. Another participant, 29-year-old Carolina Cobo, is a single mother of a seven-year-old girl. She says that beauty is subjective and that the new rules of the contest are helping combat social stigmas. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to lock women into the idea that if they are a certain age, they can no longer do certain things or because they are a mother. We continue to be women with a dream, with a message and a life intention,\u201d said Cobo in a video interview, who represents the province of Pichincha. This isn\u2019t the first time in Latin America that a beauty pageant contestant\u2019s age has drawn attention. In April, Alejandra Rodriguez made headlines across the world when she was crowned Miss Buenos Aires, becoming the first sexagenarian to win a contest organized by the Miss Universe franchise. While Rodriguez\u2019s Miss Universe run ended in May when she wasn\u2019t selected to represent Argentina,\u00a0she told CNN that her participation was \u201cthe first step of a change that is coming.\u201d The Miss Universe organization has come under scrutiny in recent weeks, as the parent company of Miss USA. In May, Miss USA and Miss Teen USA resigned within days of one another amid allegations of mismanagement, toxicity and conditions that impacted their mental health.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/style/miss-universe-ecuador-oldest-participant/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_04_19_style_graham-sutherland-winston-churchill-portrait", "text": "\u201cThat is not a painting, it\u2019s a humiliation!\u201d Winston Churchill (played by John Lithgow) angrily tells the renowned painter Graham Sutherland (actor Stephen Dillane) in the first season of \u201cThe Crown,\u201d Netflix\u2019s six-series dramatization about the English monarchy. Churchill is talking about his own portrait, commissioned to celebrate his 80th birthday, as it is unveiled in London\u2019s Westminster Hall in November 1954. Churchill goes on to describe his appearance in the painting as \u201ca broken, sagging, pitiful creature,\u201d Sutherland as \u201ca Judas wielding his murderous brush,\u201d and concludes the whole work is \u201ca betrayal of friendship, and an unpatriotic, treacherous, cowardly assault by the individualistic left!\u201d The episode ends with Churchill\u2019s wife Clementine (played by Harriet Walter) watching it burn on a bonfire outside their home. Evidently, he was not a fan. While \u201cThe Crown\u201d is not a documentary, it is true that the 80th birthday portrait \u2014described by Churchill as \u201cfilthy and malignant\u201d in a letter to his personal doctor \u2014 was burned. \u201cI think he was quite vain about his image,\u201d Andre Zlattinger, Deputy Chairman UK and Head of Modern British & Irish Art at Sotheby\u2019s, explained during a press briefing. \u201cHe\u2019d had a stroke in 1953 so for him (how he was perceived) was important at that time. He\u2019d won the election in 1951 by a narrow margin, and there was quite a lot of debate about him and his leadership.\u201d While the painting itself was destroyed, a painted study of Churchill \u2014 created by Sutherland in preparation for the infamous birthday portrait \u2014 had been on display at the UK\u2019s Blenheim Palace in April, in the room where Churchill was born 150 years ago. Sutherland gave the study to his friend Alfred Hecht, who kept it for the rest of his life before gifting it to the current owner.\u00a0After its stint at the palace, it travelled to Sotheby\u2019s in New York and London ahead of it\u2019s first ever auction on June 6, where it fetched \u00a3660,000 ($842,490); lower than it\u2019s estimate of \u00a3800,000 ($1,024,000), but still the second highest price for a portrait of Churchill. \u201c(Sutherland) caught him in a much more relaxed, intimate way,\u201d Zlattinger said of the study, a small canvas painted in oils. \u201cIt\u2019s a very different depiction to the (later) painting which obviously Churchill didn\u2019t like and was later destroyed.\u201d Controlling the narrative Churchill was far from the only leader to micromanage his image, though; rulers have been controlling and falsifying their images for centuries. Sculptures of Ancient Egyptian pharaohs were stylized in ways to demonstrate their power. The female pharaoh Hatshepsut of the Eighteenth Dynasty diverted from reality completely by having herself depicted with a male torso. In the UK, Queen Elizabeth I is perhaps the most obvious example of a ruler distorting their image. Robert Blyth, Senior Curator of World and Maritime History at Royal Museums Greenwich, told CNN that after her 40s Elizabeth \u201csimply didn\u2019t age\u201d. In The Rainbow Portrait, one of her most famous paintings, any wrinkles a woman in her 60s might have had are carefully smoothed over. Queen Victoria, crowned more than 250 years after Elizabeth, also used painting to disguise her age, though the academic Ira B. Nadel wrote that her interest in photography eventually made her \u201cintolerant of idealized or inaccurate portraits.\u201d Blyth explains that, like Churchill, \u201ca touch of vanity\u201d drove monarchs\u2019 tightly controlled image; \u201cWho would want to have their portrait painted and look exactly as they do?\u201d, he joked.\u202fHowever, leaders also needed to provide political stability. Elizabeth I was \u201cthe end of the Tudor line\u201d, Blyth noted. \u201cThe idea of her image reflecting any frailty would have caused suspicion.\u201d Dr Caroline Rae, an associate lecturer in History of Art at University College London, agreed. \u201cIt was a period of big changes, people being beheaded,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cMortality is something which causes instability. (Elizabeth) knows things are maybe not as stable as one might think. She\u2019s in a precarious position.\u201d Altering public perceptions Churchill himself faced political precarity. An already tumultuous career landed him in Downing Street during the Second World War, but he was voted out almost as soon as it was over. He did become Prime Minister for a second time in 1951, but his Conservative Party only had a 17-seat majority and, in April 1955, six months after the birthday portrait debacle, Churchill resigned over ill health. \u201cThere was the Suez crisis happening, and Stalin had died in 1953, so there was a lot of stuff going on,\u201d Zlattinger said. \u201cHis health and political position at that time contributed to him being particularly controlling about how that portrait was created and perceived,\u201d Bryn Sayles, Head of Sale, Modern & Post-War British Art at Sotheby\u2019s, told CNN. \u201cBut even on earlier commissions, Churchill was quite famously a very tricky sitter and wanted to be depicted in a particular way. For instance, he made sculptor Jacob Epstein take out a bit of flab from underneath his chin (in a work), so from the beginning, Churchill understood the importance of his image as a politician and was very clear about how he felt that image should be presented to the public.\u201d Historic photographs of the UK\u2019s royal family were also regularly altered, however, not everyone was happy about it. Swiss historian Alexis Schwarzenbach reported that Queen Elizabeth, wife of King George VI and mother of Queen Elizabeth II, returned her 50th birthday photo to photographer Cecil Beaton in 1950, with instructions to reduce the amount of retouching done to her lips and chin. Just four years later, Churchill\u2019s very different reaction to his own \u2018imperfections\u2019 led to the scene now immortalized in \u201cThe Crown\u201d \u2014 a factor which Sayles explains has ironically piqued buyers\u2019 interests in owning his portraits. \u201cAfter \u201cThe Crown\u201d episode and Gary Oldman\u2019s portrayal of Churchill in the \u201cDarkest Hour\u201d movie, we literally had new collectors coming in the market looking for Churchill paintings because there was a renewed interest in him.\u201d While Churchill certainly would not have appreciated fresh attention on his hated portrait, buyers appetite for the study proves that the legacy of one of the UK\u2019s most famous leaders is far from over yet.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/19/style/graham-sutherland-winston-churchill-portrait/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "world"}}

Russia\u2019s Investigative Committee said earlier on Thursday that a French citizen, employed by the non-profit Swiss Center for Humanitarian Dialogue, was detained on suspicion of \u201ccollecting information in the field of military activities of the Russian Federation.\u201d Video released by the Investigative Committee showed the man being arrested by security personnel\u00a0at\u00a0a cafe in Moscow and escorted\u00a0into a military van.

An Investigative Committee official told Russian state news agency TASS that the man worked as a consultant at the non-profit handling Eurasian issues after the February 2014 events in Ukraine, including the mass pro-democracy protests that swept Kyiv and the exit of the pro-Russian, former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich. CNN has reached out to the French Foreign Ministry and the Swiss Center for Humanitarian Dialogue for comment. Relations between both countries became strained when Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine more than two years ago. Several Westerners have found themselves detained in the country amid the rising tensions.

{"id": "2024_06_07_weather_heat-dome-wave-record-temperatures-southwest", "text": "A dangerous heat wave is expanding into new areas of the West and lingering in others Friday, bringing with it record-breaking temperatures and a serious risk of heat-related illness. The searing heat has already taken its toll. Since last weekend, multiple people in different parts of the US have died or have been hospitalized due to heat-related illnesses. The worst of the heat peaked Thursday for much of California and the Southwest, but unseasonably hot conditions will stick around in these areas and expand into the Pacific Northwest at least through the weekend. Heat alerts are in effect for more than 16 million people in California, Nevada, Arizona, Utah and New Mexico. Most will last through Friday but alerts in Las Vegas and Death Valley, California, last into Saturday. Several notable temperature records were broken Thursday in California, Arizona and Nevada. In California, a high of 122 degrees in Death Valley broke a daily record set in 1996. And in Fresno, a 121-year-old record was tied Thursday when the city maxed out at 107 degrees. Phoenix recorded its first high of 110 degrees or more this year when thermometers topped out at a daily record-setting 113 degrees Thursday. Las Vegas soared to 111 degrees Thursday, the earliest in the year the city has reached the mark, breaking the daily record of 110 degrees set in 2010. Several people across US have died from heat-related illnesses Six people believed to be migrants have died because of the heat in the past week along the US-Mexico border from southwestern Texas to New Mexico, according to US Border Patrol and the Sunland Park, New Mexico, fire department. Four people died \u201cfrom heat stroke and dehydration\u201d while triple-digit temperatures baked the area last weekend, the US Border Patrol, El Paso Sector said. Two more people were discovered in a desert area about six miles from the border in Sunland Park and were pronounced dead Wednesday, Sunland Park fire chief Daniel Medrano told CNN. Sunland Park is around 10 miles northwest of El Paso, Texas, along the New Mexico-Mexico border. Excessive heat is the leading weather related killer in the US, according to the National Weather Service. \u201cThis is especially true in the urban centers, where population density, the urban heat island, and building construction exacerbate the effects of excessive heat,\u201d the weather service says. \u201cA combination of high heat and humidity can lead to heat related illness, including heat cramps, heat exhaustion, and heat stroke.\u201d In the East, a 59-year-old man died of heat-related complications in Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland, officials said Wednesday. Additional details about the man\u2019s death, which was the state\u2019s first heat-related death of the year, were not released. Heat proved challenging for firefighters battling a blaze in California\u2019s Napa County Wednesday. Four firefighters were sent to area hospitals for injuries related to difficult terrain and \u201chot summer conditions,\u201d according to CAL Fire\u2019s Sonoma-Lake-Napa Unit. All four are expected to make full recoveries. Phoenix emergency responders on Thursday say they hospitalized 11 people due to heat exhaustion while they were attending a Donald Trump rally at the Dream City Church. With the risk of heat-related illnesses increasing for millions across the country, officials in several states are trying to keep residents safe during the smoldering heat. In California, cooling centers have been set up for those affected by triple-digit heat. As Texas contends with both severe storms and excessive heat, a state disaster declaration remains active. Hazardous heat expected into weekend Heat will continue through the weekend before easing off a bit early next week. However, many typically hot areas in the West will still have to contend with temperatures up to 10 degrees above normal and warm nighttime lows will make it difficult for those vulnerable to extreme conditions to be able to cool off. The Las Vegas metro area is at \u201cextreme\u201d risk from the heat through Saturday, according to a scale from the National Weather Service that gauges heat\u2019s potential impact on people\u2019s health. The highest level on the heat risk scale means residents without enough cooling and hydration will be impacted, and \u201cimpacts are likely in most health systems, heat-sensitive industries and infrastructure.\u201d Several more large metro areas in Arizona, California, New Mexico and Texas will face a \u201cmajor\u201d Level 3 of 4 heat risk. Summerlike heat will expand north and east Friday and reach the Northwest and parts of the Rockies. Records could be broken in parts of Oregon, Washington and Idaho from Friday through the weekend. While it won\u2019t be record-breaking, Seattle could come close to 80 degrees on Saturday, 10 degrees warmer than what\u2019s typical for early June.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/weather/heat-dome-wave-record-temperatures-southwest/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_weather_tornado-maryland-dc", "text": "Damaging storms and tornadoes hit parts of at least three states, including a Washington, DC, suburb Wednesday, killing at least one person and injuring others. A tornado ripped through the Detroit suburb of Livonia, Michigan, during the afternoon and toppled a tree onto a home, killing a 2-year-old and severely injuring the child\u2019s mother. \u201cThis is a terrible tragedy for our community,\u201d Livonia Mayor Maureen Miller Brosnan said in a\u00a0news release. \u201cOur hearts are broken, too, and we send our deepest sympathies.\u201d The storm that tracked through Livonia tore a 5.5-mile path and was rated an EF1 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale, with peak winds of 95 mph, according to a preliminary survey from the National Weather Service in Detroit.  Storms intensified as they tracked through West Virginia and Maryland Wednesday evening and produced more than 10 reports of tornadoes in the two states. A tornado tracking through the Washington, DC, suburb of Gaithersburg, Maryland, trapped five people in a ranch-style home after it collapsed in the storm. One person was taken to a hospital with traumatic injuries, Montgomery County Fire and Rescue Assistant Chief David Pazos told CNN. Two other homes in the densely packed suburb with about 70,000 residents were significantly damaged by trees, according to the fire department\u2019s chief spokesperson Pete Piringer. Several people were removed from damaged structures and transported to hospitals, emergency officials said. At least seven tornadoes have been confirmed in the Baltimore area, with notable tornadoes in both Montgomery\u00a0County and Baltimore County receiving EF1 ratings after reaching winds of 105 mph, the National Weather Service said. A tornado was also seen near Baltimore, in Arbutus, Maryland at around 8:55 p.m. ET, the National Weather Service office there said. Details about what damage that tornado caused, if any, to structures were not immediately available. The US Storm Prediction Center said numerous trees and power lines were down in the area. In the Sykesville, Maryland, area, there were no immediate reports of injuries but at least 10 structures were damaged, mostly by the high winds, according to fire department spokesperson Bill Rehkopf. One was significantly damaged by a tree. Survey teams with the National Weather Service are visiting the hard-hit areas to assess the damage to determine how many tornadoes there were and how strong they were. Weak tornadoes are not uncommon in the DC region, but only a handful in recorded history have been EF3 or stronger. In 2002, an EF4 tornado devastated parts of La Plata, Maryland, south of DC. That storm killed three people and caused more than $100 million in damage, according to data from the National Weather Service. Tornadoes were also seen in Alabama and Ohio as storms across the country exceeded forecast expectations. A possible tornado also caused damage in Frazeysburg, Ohio, around 50 miles east of Columbus. Photos show debris littered streets, snapped power poles and some partially collapsed structures. Nine people were injured, including at least four taken to a nearby hospital, according to CNN affiliate WBNS.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/weather/tornado-maryland-dc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "world"}}

Yolanda S\u00e1nchez Figueroa, mayor of Cotija in Michoac\u00e1n state,\u00a0was walking from a gym back to her house with her bodyguard when they were shot by people in a white van, the state attorney general said in a statement. Both S\u00e1nchez Figueroa and her bodyguard later died in hospital, it said, adding that an investigation has been launched. Confirmation of S\u00e1nchez Figueroa\u2019s death came hours after Claudia Sheinbaum\u00a0won a landslide victory to become the first female president of Mexico, marking an achievement in a country known for its patriarchal culture and widespread femicide. Widespread violence against politicians loomed large in the election, the bloodiest in Mexico\u2019s history. Dozens of political candidates and applicants were killed by criminal organizations during the campaign season in attempts to influence the vote. Sheinbaum will begin her presidency on October 1, replacing the outgoing President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, her longtime ally whose social welfare programs lifted many Mexicans out of poverty, making their leftist Morena party favorite in the polls. But she inherits an epidemic of gang-led violence and unsolved disappearances in the country and faces an urgent task to bolster domestic and border security.

{"id": "2024_06_07_asia_japan-host-club-debt-exploitation-intl-hnk-dst", "text": "Yu felt a rush of excitement as she walked into his bar for the first time \u2013 eager to meet the charming young host she\u2019d been following for years online. On that cold January night last year, they chatted over champagne \u2013 the first of many meetings that would have Yu fast falling in love. Yu, 41, a clinician and divorced mother of two, soon began spending every spare minute with him at the bar in Tokyo\u2019s main red-light district, dropping thousands of dollars on heavily marked-up alcohol. In return, he showered Yu with attention and small gifts, celebrating her birthday with her and even promising to buy her a ring. \u201cHe said, \u2018You are my girlfriend,\u2019\u201d said Yu, who CNN is identifying by a pseudonym to protect her privacy. \u201cI believed him.\u201d Yu says the host, handsome and in his 20s, encouraged her to run up a bar tab that quickly spiraled out of control. Then, her money ran out \u2013 and everything changed. With no way for Yu to pay the 25 million yen (about $165,000) she owed to the bar, he said he would take care of the debt. But now she would have to repay him \u2013 with sex work the only way to raise the cash. Yu is one of hundreds of women coerced to sell their bodies after frequenting Japan\u2019s so-called \u201chost clubs,\u201d experts told CNN. There are more than 300 of these venues in Tokyo\u2019s neon-lit Kabukicho district, offering male companionship to lonely women. Though not all hosts exploit their female clients, authorities say some clubs are linked to organized crime, while campaigners say loose regulation of the industry has allowed abuse to fester. Under current laws, anybody over the age of 18 can enter the clubs, and efforts by lawmakers to introduce stronger protections have so far failed. Cases of extreme debt, exploitation and sex trafficking surged after Covid restrictions were lifted in 2023, activists say, with women flocking to host clubs following several years of business closures and isolation. Last year, Tokyo police arrested 140 people for alleged prostitution in Kabukicho, according to public broadcaster NHK \u2013 a threefold increase from the previous year. Of those detained, 40% told police they were soliciting to repay debts run up at host clubs, NHK reported. With such cases mounting, authorities set up helplines for victims and arrested hosts for allegedly coercing indebted customers into sex work. In December, Tokyo police inspected 176 host clubs in Kabukicho, NHK reported \u2013 finding regulatory violations in 75% of the venues, mainly for not clearly displaying the price of alcohol and for placing menus out of sight. \u201cIt\u2019s a romance scam, basically,\u201d said Ayaka Shiomura, a member of Japan\u2019s upper house of parliament, who has unsuccessfully pushed for better safeguards against exploitative host clubs. \u201cSome of these women are brainwashed into thinking they\u2019re dating these hosts. It\u2019s a vicious, bad cycle.\u201d The price of love For many victims, that cycle begins online, especially on social media \u2013 where hosts built their fanbase when pandemic restrictions forced their clubs to close. Mikami Rui, 28, has worked as a host for the past 10 years \u2013 and says for much of his career, the clubs weren\u2019t very well known. But \u201cawareness is spreading in Japan\u201d because of platforms like Instagram, TikTok and X, where hosts are \u201cworking very hard to become more visible,\u201d he said. While he insists he has never forced a customer into sex work, he admits to previously persuading women to spend far beyond their means. Now, he claims, \u201cI entertain women without pressuring them for money \u2026 I stick to what they can afford.\u201d On these apps, hosts identify and flirt with prospective customers to entice them to visit the clubs, said Hidemori Gen, an advocate in Tokyo who provides a drop-in consultation service for victims of sexual abuse and gang violence. Often, hosts target vulnerable young women, draining them of their savings and then coercing them into sex work to repay their bar debts, Gen said. Yu had watched the host\u2019s YouTube videos for two years before going to his club \u2013 that first meeting laying the groundwork for a one-sided relationship of false promises. After that night, he reached out asking to see her again \u2013 so Yu visited the club once more. Soon, he was treating her at restaurants and hookah bars, paying her special attention \u201cover other girls,\u201d she said. He talked about going to the places she wanted to visit, like Disneyland or Japan\u2019s popular island destination Okinawa. This kind of special attention is why victims \u2013 some as young as 18 \u2013 often genuinely believe the hosts are their boyfriends, said Shiomura, the national assembly member. Hosts may have sex with their customers \u201cearly on\u201d to establish intimacy, saying things like \u201cI love you\u201d and \u201clet\u2019s get married\u201d \u2013 some even going as far as meeting the women\u2019s parents, she said. The whole time, Yu was racking up bills she couldn\u2019t pay. Host clubs often offer steep discounts for new customers, luring them in with cheap drinks then jacking up the prices once they\u2019re hooked \u2013 with some bottles of alcohol costing as much as $6,000. Many hosts also encourage clients to keep their bar tab open for weeks at a time \u2013 which is how debts can balloon out of sight. \u201cHe asked me, \u2018How are you going to pay me back?\u2019 and when I said I didn\u2019t know, he said, \u2018Go abroad for sex work,\u2019\u201d Yu said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to. But he said it was the only way and that I could make 8 million yen (about $53,000) a month.\u201d Desperate and depleted of her savings, Yu began working as a prostitute in Japan and the Chinese territories of Macao and Hong Kong. It didn\u2019t feel like she had a choice, she said. \u201cWe worked 10-hour-plus shifts. Every hour, there was a show and I would get picked, then bought. It made me really sad to see about 100 girls, including myself, be bought,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen my body was exhausted or I felt weak, I thought it\u2019d be easier to die. I thought about that a lot.\u201d Overcome with shame and anger at herself, she didn\u2019t tell friends or family about her predicament. Shiomura, the lawmaker, said even when being exploited, many women still view the hosts as their boyfriends and want to support them. \u201cI think it tells you how this mind control runs deep,\u201d she said. No regulations, no relief Gen, who runs the consultation service for abuse victims, says he has seen a fivefold increase of cases like Yu\u2019s in the past year alone. \u201cLast spring, when we came out of the pandemic and the masks came off, that\u2019s when consultations about host clubs increased dramatically,\u201d he said. And laws lag the surge in cases, allowing exploitative host clubs to continue their shady practices. Shiomura last year proposed a bill in parliament that called for government investigations, public awareness campaigns, counseling services and employment assistance for victims. Rejected by the ruling party, the bill failed to pass, with some critics arguing female customers bear responsibility for visiting host clubs and spending irresponsibly. That means it\u2019s largely up to hosts and host clubs to self-regulate \u2013 which some have promised to do.\u00a0Since April, more than a dozen host club operators in Tokyo \u2013 each owning several venues \u2013 said they would refuse entry to women under the legal drinking age of 20 and prevent customers from running up massive debts. Rui, the host, welcomed the measure, saying clubs that break the guidelines should be shut down. But there are far more clubs beyond those owned by the 13 operators that have pledged to follow the new self-imposed rules \u2013 and no such commitment on a national level. Even within Tokyo, Shiomura voiced doubts about whether clubs would honor their promises, and said she would resubmit the rejected bill if the problem continued. \u201cA lot of people say that it is the woman\u2019s self-responsibility. But I wouldn\u2019t dare think that,\u201d she said. \u201cI think there\u2019s a problem with Japanese society that looks at the bodies of such young women, young women in their teens and 20s, as products.\u201d And there is little relief for victims whose lives have already been upended. Yu is no longer seeing the host, who she says released her from her debt after she\u2019d paid back most of it. But with bills to cover and heavy credit card debt, she still feels trapped. \u201cI\u2019m still doing sex work because I can\u2019t afford to leave. I don\u2019t want to do this work. I feel like I\u2019m going to fall apart,\u201d Yu said. \u201cI\u2019ve hit rock bottom. I don\u2019t know if I can start over again.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/asia/japan-host-club-debt-exploitation-intl-hnk-dst/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_04_asia_cambodia-lloyd-austin-china-intl-hnk", "text": "US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin traveled to Cambodia on Tuesday to meet with the country\u2019s prime minister and defense minister, as Washington becomes increasingly concerned that Phnom Penh\u00a0may grant China\u2019s military exclusive access to a key naval base. Austin\u2019s trip to the Cambodian capital marks his second visit to the Southeast Asian country as Secretary of Defense but is the first time a United States defense chief has traveled to Cambodia specifically to hold a bilateral meeting with his counterpart, Defense Minister Tea Seiha. The outreach reflects the US\u2019 desire to forge a better relationship with Cambodia, defense officials said, particularly as Beijing\u2019s influence over the country has only continued to grow in recent years. \u201cWe believe there is potentially an opportunity, with leadership transition in Cambodia, for us to sit down and talk about how our relationship might have a more positive and optimistic path in the future,\u201d a senior defense official told reporters, referring to Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet, who took office last year following his father Hun Sen\u2019s nearly four-decade rule. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a visit that is about significant deliverables and achievements.\u201d Austin did express the US\u2019 concerns, however, about China\u2019s funding of and presence at Cambodia\u2019s Ream Naval Base on the Gulf of Thailand, officials said. In December, China docked two warships at the base, which is in a highly strategic position close to the South China Sea. Cambodian officials have repeatedly denied the facility would be used by China as a naval base, insisting the project is in line with Cambodia\u2019s constitution, which bars foreign military bases on its territory. Chinese officials, meanwhile, have described the base as an\u00a0\u201caid project\u201d\u00a0to strengthen Cambodia\u2019s navy and called assertions otherwise \u201chype\u201d with \u201culterior motives.\u201d Beijing claims \u201cindisputable sovereignty\u201d over almost all of the 1.3-million-square-mile South China Sea, a characterization the US and many of its Indo-Pacific allies reject. Chinese vessels and aircraft have been widely documented harassing others operating in the area, including American ships and planes. The US has been particularly alarmed in recent weeks by China\u2019s attacks on Philippine vessels in the South China Sea using powerful water cannons. China also carried out large-scale military drills around the self-governing island of Taiwan last week as \u201cpunishment\u201d for its inauguration of a new president, who is openly loathed by Beijing for championing the island\u2019s sovereignty. The behavior underscores why the US is worried about the possibility that China could establish a new military outpost so close to the key waterway. \u201cThere are no doubts about where our concerns are,\u201d a Pentagon spokesperson said following Austin\u2019s meetings, when asked about Ream. \u201cMeeting face-to-face gives us a chance not only to speak clearly about our concerns, but to talk about how we might work together in the future to strengthen our relationship. And we don\u2019t ask any country to choose between partners.\u201d But as China and Cambodia have reaffirmed their military cooperation, relations between Washington and Phnom Penh have grown increasingly strained. Cambodia canceled military exercises with the US in 2017 and demolished a US-built facility at Ream in 2020, as the US has repeatedly condemned the country\u2019s poor human rights record and democratic backsliding. Last year, the Biden administration\u00a0imposed sanctions on Cambodian individuals in response to Cambodia\u2019s election, which the State Department characterized as \u201cneither free nor fair.\u201d On Tuesday, however, Austin met with former Prime Minister Hun Sen, who now serves as president of Cambodia\u2019s Senate after\u00a0transferring power to his son,\u00a0a military general. Defense officials are particularly hopeful that Austin can forge a relationship with Prime Minister Hun Manet, who, like Austin, attended the US Military Academy at West Point and is seen as more westernized than his father. In a readout following Austin\u2019s meetings, the Pentagon said\u00a0the \u201cofficials\u00a0discussed opportunities to strengthen the US-Cambodia bilateral defense relationship in support of regional peace and security, including through the resumption of military training exchanges on disaster assistance and United Nations Peacekeeping, training and exchanges on de-mining and unexploded ordnance clearance, and Cambodia\u2019s access to US PME [professional military education] programs. They also welcomed continued discussions about these issues between their respective defense establishments.\u201d Austin\u2019s visit to Phnom Penh capped a five-day trip to Asia, where he attended the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore and warned of China\u2019s \u201ccoercive\u201d activities in the region while working to deepen the US\u2019 relationships with key Asian leaders. In a meeting with China\u2019s Defense Minister Dong Jun last week, their first face-to-face, Austin said the US wants to keep military-to-military channels open with the Chinese to avoid misunderstandings and escalation. In a combative speech later on, Dong appeared to agree with that, but he also slammed \u201cexternal interfering forces\u201d for selling arms and having \u201cillegal official contacts\u201d with Taiwan \u2014 a thinly veiled reference to the US, which maintains close yet unofficial ties with the island democracy. In the same remarks, however, Dong said Beijing \u201cnever acts from the so-called position of strength.\u201d A senior US official told CNN that the speech was \u201cat complete odds with the reality\u201d of\u00a0China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army\u2019s\u00a0\u201ccoercive activity across the region.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/asia/cambodia-lloyd-austin-china-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_04_10_style_graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers", "text": "Climbing up abandoned, unfinished floors and tightrope walking across balcony ledges, backpacks clanging with cans of alkyd and acrylic, a collective of Los Angeles graffiti artists have transformed their craft beyond urban aesthetics to champion community issues. Their choice of canvas: Oceanwide Plaza in Downtown LA. Occupying over a full square city block, the plaza was imagined as a vast mixed-use building project, offering city residents over 500 lavish condominiums, a five-star hotel, retail spaces, restaurants and a private 2-acre park. However, construction on the $1 billion project, which began in 2015, was shelved after the Chinese-backed contractor Oceanwide Holdings ran out of funding\u00a0in 2019 \u2014 and it has lain unfinished ever since. The plaza\u2019s status \u2014 and potential \u2014 as an eye-catching venue for their work spread by word of mouth within the graffiti community in recent months. Security at the site was known to be lax, an important detail as accessing the plaza\u2019s towers and other buildings constitutes trespassing. (The Los Angeles City Attorney confirmed to CNN that, as of April 3, criminal charges have been filed against 23 individuals, for violations including trespassing and possession of vandalism tools.) \u201cIt was like a gift from the graffiti gods\u2026 A giant canvas in the middle of downtown,\u201d tagger ENDEM told CNN, speaking on behalf of himself and his graffiti crew, NCT. \u201cWe were like, \u2018Let\u2019s do it right. Let\u2019s do it as if the whole world is going to see this.\u2019\u201d Historically, graffiti has often been used as protest art. While the practice dates back thousands of years, it\u2019s most commonly viewed in a contemporary context (within graffiti\u2019s \u201cmodern\u201d era, which dates back to the 1960s and 70s) as a creative vehicle for challenging societal norms and inequities \u2014 whether on the Berlin Wall in Germany or subway cars in New York City; whether painted by anonymous artists or well-known figures like Keith Haring or Banksy, even if the latter is, technically, anonymous himself. Still, neither ENDEM nor any of the other artists involved realized how famous their work on the Oceanside towers would become. Sharing his artwork on Instagram on January 31, a video from ENDEM quickly racked up tens of thousands of views: Vibrant images of bright block lettering splayed across the building\u2019s exterior paired with footage from the inside \u2014 the artist posing with shots of his spray paint cans, poised above the cityscape. The viral footage, among other visuals shared on social media, quickly opened the floodgates. Hitting Oceanside became a mark of credibility in the graffiti world; by mid-February, the number of tags and other graffiti pieces there were multiplying overnight. \u201cIt was an open house people going in and out. It was beautiful. It was like graffiti paradise,\u201d ENDEM said. \u201cIt felt exactly like the streets, but concentrated.\u201d Transformed in part into an art installation, Oceanwide became an opportunity for the graffiti artists to leave a message to the city below, and a call-out to policy makers who leave buildings to rot. \u201cGraffiti shows you where the city hurts,\u201d Roger Gastman, owner and founder of the LA-based arts organization Beyond the Streets, told CNN. Renowned for its large-scale exhibitions, immersive educational programs, pop-up events and partnerships, Beyond the Streets works to educate and celebrate the diverse dimensions of graffiti as a medium. To him, the mission of graffiti is clear: to challenge, educate, and redefine public perception of the medium. Earl Ofari Hutchinson, president of The Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable, a nonpartisan public policy forum\u00a0for civic participation and education,\u00a0sees the abandoned towers as amplifying the social issues of the community they are situated in, connecting the graffiti-laden structures to the urban blight that surrounds them in LA\u2019s Skid Row. Skid Row is a 50-block sector of downtown LA where between 8,000 and 11,000 unhoused people live in challenging, often squalid conditions. \u201cYou\u2019ve got tens of thousands of people displaced because of over urban development. And as a result of that, they\u2019re on the streets,\u201d Hutchinson told CNN, noting that the homeless population in Los Angeles is continuing to grow. (The Los Angeles Housing Services Authority reports a 9% increase in homelessness in LA county in 2023 and a 10% increase in the city from 2022.) \u201cNow, set right in the middle of that, you have\u2026 a development that will never be completed.\u201d \u201cWhat you have here is a classic urban nightmare brought on by very poor policies \u2014 fiscal, financial, budgetary and political problems (in) a city that has just gone off the rails in terms of over-development and lack of affordability,\u201d Hutchinson added. Still, Hutchinson is no fan of the graffiti either. To him, and many other LA residents who have said they disapprove of the \u201cvandalism,\u201d the plaza is a sore sight for eyes. \u201cThe problem is you\u2019re talking about violating public space and with no permission\u2026 that doesn\u2019t fly with me,\u201d Hutchinson said. \u201cThe fact of the matter is, the public has not given you approval. (And) the general public has to pay for the removal.\u201d Costs currently borne by the taxpayer at the Oceanwide Plaza site include the security details provided by the LAPD as well as the graffiti cleanup Hutchinson highlights. (\u201cThis has strained our deployment,\u201d LAPD Chief Michel Moore said during a February meeting of the Los Angeles City Council. \u201cWe have called in some officers on an overtime basis so that we can provide for these added patrols or station them at that site to deter vandals and others from gaining access.\u201d) Clean teams working in the neighborhoods surrounding Oceanwide remove on average some 2,000 square feet of graffiti per week, with that figure growing in recent months. \u201cPeople forget that people live here. People own businesses here and they don\u2019t want to have to spend the time and money to clean it up,\u201d said Blair Besten, executive director of the Historic Core of Downtown Los Angeles, an organization which works to improve the quality of life in downtown neighborhoods. The Historic Core prioritizes street sweeping, trash collection \u2014 and graffiti removal. \u201cI would hardly call what they\u2019re doing art,\u201d Besten argued of the Oceanwide taggers. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty sloppy and quick. They come in fast and they knock it out and they leave.\u201d But to Gastman, graffiti is a powerful form of expression, and a call-to-action \u2014 particularly for those who emanate from struggles within home life, gang life or societal turmoil. Graffiti culture can offer an unexpected support system for those the city has abandoned, Gastman said. It becomes a platform for them to make their voices heard. \u201cIn graffiti culture, a lot of us know each other. We\u2019re all friends. We have the same mentality \u2014 we\u2019re just trying to get up. We\u2019re just trying to get noticed,\u201d explained ENDEM. In the midst of an addiction that led to his rock bottom, graffiti became his lifeline, he explained. \u201cI was at my lowest of lows, still trying to stay sober, I needed some type of outlet,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cGraffiti is something that you can hold on to. Its bigger than me, its everyone, it\u2019s a community.\u201d In this, ENDEM believes that the beauty of Oceanwide isn\u2019t tangible. Rather, it lies in the birth of a new generation of graffiti writers. \u201cThey can erase the graffiti on buildings, but they can never erase the impact that it has on the city of Los Angeles and the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to it. Yes, it\u2019s vandalism. Yes, it\u2019s art, and it\u2019s everything in between,\u201d Gastman concluded. \u201cThis is a real culture. It\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/10/style/graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_07_tech_ai-regulation-nightcap", "text": "Some of the biggest companies on the planet have staked their futures, and ours, on the proliferation of AI, a technology so complex and dangerous its own inventors are begging them to slow down. That sure\u00a0seems\u00a0like the kind of thing US lawmakers might want to regulate on a level comparable to the federal government\u2019s strict oversight of, say, narcotics or cigarettes, or even TikTok. But Congress hasn\u2019t passed a single bill on AI, and a bipartisan \u201croadmap\u201d released last month is far from certain to be taken during an election year. (Which is ironic, given that one of the priorities of the roadmap is making sure AI doesn\u2019t, like, hijack the American electoral process.) Unsurprisingly, then, we\u2019re relying on the understaffed, underfunded Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department to try to keep Big Tech in line through enforcement. See here: Antitrust officials at the FTC and the Justice Department are nearing a final agreement this week on how to jointly oversee AI giants including Microsoft, Google, Nvidia, OpenAI and others, my colleague\u00a0Brian Fung reports. The agreement suggests a broad crackdown is coming, and fast. But likely not fast enough. The proverbial AI horse has left the barn, and it\u2019s running wild. Nvidia, a chipmaking company few people had heard of even a year ago, recently joined the $3 trillion club, briefly surpassing Apple as the second most valuable publicly traded company in the United States. Microsoft remains the No. 1 company by market cap, a feat it owes to its investments in ChatGPT maker OpenAI. All of that money was able flood in because the notoriously tech-challenged lawmakers in Washington have been largely asleep at the wheel. (European officials, meanwhile, formally adopted the world\u2019s first standalone AI law this spring, a full five years after rules were proposed.) The money part can\u2019t be overstated. Until recently, AI was a largely academic subject rarely discussed outside of Silicon Valley. Then OpenAI blew the door off its hinges by unleashing ChatGPT to the world, setting off a gold rush that\u2019s become the hottest play on Wall Street. And that is exactly what a group of current and former OpenAI employees are now warning about. \u201dAI companies have strong financial incentives to avoid effective oversight,\u201d they wrote\u00a0in an open letter\u00a0this week. \u201cSo long as there is no effective government oversight of these corporations, current and former employees are among the few people who can hold them accountable to the public. Yet broad confidentiality agreements block us from voicing our concerns, except to the very companies that may be failing to address these issues.\u201d In other words, we\u2019re counting on the newly wealthy tech nerds to self-regulate.

The Nationwide Samsung Electronics Union (NSEU) said last week that its 28,000 members \u2014 just under a quarter of the company\u2019s total workforce in the country \u2014 would stage a one-day strike on June 7, following failed negotiations over pay and bonus arrangements. The union asked its members to take a day off on Friday, which falls between a public holiday on Thursday and the weekend. Son Woomok, a union leader, told CNN that \u201cmany employees used their annual leave today,\u201d and at one site \u201call workers had taken leave so replacement personnel were deployed.\u201d He did not provide other details. He had previously said many NSEU members work for Samsung\u2019s flagship semiconductor unit. That division is trying to regain its former status as a top semiconductor company, according to Reuters, which says Samsung has fallen behind its competitors SK Hynix\u00a0and Micron Technology\u00a0in delivering chips used in artificial intelligence (AI) processors. A Samsung spokesperson told CNN that, \u201cthere is no impact on production and management activities\u201d as a result of the one-day walkout. \u201cToday\u2019s annual leave use rate is lower than last year\u2019s Memorial Day holiday\u2019s annual leave use rate,\u201d the spokesperson added. The world\u2019s biggest memory chipmaker has had a rough few years. A historic\u00a0shortage\u00a0of computer chips during the Covid\u00a0pandemic\u00a0was followed by falling demand last year as consumer appetite for electronics remained weak because of global economic uncertainty. But things are looking up for the company because of the AI boom. It is optimistic about a resurgence in demand for mobile devices this year, particularly with the rollout of new products, such as AI-powered smartphones. Last month, Samsung reported a more than\u00a0tenfold rise\u00a0in first-quarter operating profit amid forecasts of high demand for AI and high-end chips, an area in which it competes with Intel (INTC) and Taiwan\u2019s TSMC. The vast majority of the world\u2019s advanced microchips are made in just two places: Taiwan and South Korea.

{"id": "2024_05_30_asia_japan-whaling-mothership-kangei-maru-intl-hnk", "text": "Wearing a toy whale hat, whale tie and a whale motif shirt, Hideki Tokoro spends much of his days thinking about the world\u2019s largest mammals. But he doesn\u2019t want to protect them. He wants to hunt them. To do that his company Kyodo Senpaku has built and launched a brand-new whaling $48 million \u201cmothership\u201d \u2013 the Kangei Maru. \u201cWe are proud of catching whales and are very proud of this ship which will allow us to begin offshore mothership-style whaling this year,\u201d Tokoro told reporters as he escorted them around the 370-foot, 9,300-ton vessel that set sail last Saturday for an eight-month tour of the country\u2019s northern waters. The new ship replaces the Nisshin Maru, the infamous whaling factory vessel dubbed by activists as a \u201cfloating slaughterhouse\u201d that was decommissioned in 2020 after more than 30 years of service, during which it frequently clashed with anti-whaling activists. The Kangei Maru is bigger and faster than its predecessor, the company says, and is equipped with state-of-the-art drones able to travel a reported 100 kilometers (62 miles) to allow crews of smaller boats to quickly locate and kill whales. But some activists say the ship\u2019s high-powered features, including a cruising range of 13,000 kilometers (more than 8,000 miles) and its ability to sail for up to 60 days, suggests that Japan could set its sights on whales far beyond its northern waters. \u201cJapan has never given up on its whaling ambitions,\u201d veteran anti-whaling activist Paul Watson told CNN. \u201cThe only purpose of a vessel like that is so it can travel long distances to the Southern Ocean to hunt whales, (and) what the whalers are doing right now is really just a test run. They are testing out the new ship in their waters.\u201d \u2018We need to cull whales\u2019 The Kangei Maru boasts a slipway large enough to haul 85-foot whales from the sea that leads to an indoor flensing deck the size\u00a0of two basketball courts. There, workers will strip away the blubber before cutting up the whale flesh on enormous cutting boards, before vacuum-packing and storing the meat in 40 industrial freezers, ready for sale. \u201cWhales are at the top of the food chain. They compete with humans by eating marine creatures that should be feeding other fish,\u201d Tokoro said on the tour. \u201cWe need to cull whales to keep the balance of the ecosystem \u2013 it\u2019s our job and mission to protect oceans for the future.\u201d He also told CNN that most of the ship\u2019s catch would be killed \u201calmost instantly\u201d by cannons at sea. \u201cWe aim for perfection, but some of them may suffer. In such cases, we will use a rifle to finish the job.\u201d Besides objecting to the slaughter one of the ocean\u2019s most majestic creatures, marine conservation groups and scientists have highlighted the important role which whales play in helping to tackle the climate crisis through sequestering and storing planet-heating carbon emissions. \u201cWhales are not just consumers in ocean eco-systems \u2013 they recycle a ton of nutrients into the environment which helps stimulate plant-life growth,\u201d\u00a0said marine ecologist Ari Friedlaender, also rejecting pro-whaling arguments that commercial hunts could be \u201csustainable.\u201d \u201cHumans have a very long history of killing whales and have not done a good job of being able to sustainably harvest animals,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no way to sustainably harvest a wild animal like that.\u201d Why is Japan so determined to keep whaling? Commercial whaling was banned in 1986 under a moratorium by the International Whaling Commission (IWC) after whale populations were almost driven to extinction by humans. Japan is one of three countries \u2013 along with Norway and Iceland \u2013 that continues to hunt whales, and officials argue that the industry is an important part of its culture and history \u2013 and also provides food security. Iceland, which has fiercely defended commercial whaling, said it would end whaling in 2024, citing falling demand for whale meat as well as \u201chigh operation costs and little proof of any economic advantage.\u201d Commercial whaling continues in Norway, which experts say has quietly become the world\u2019s leading whaling nation \u2013 killing more whales than Japan and Iceland combined. For decades, Japan has justified whaling under the guise of \u201cscientific research.\u201d In 2018, it tried one last time to persuade the IWC to allow it to resume commercial whaling \u2013 and failed. So, it withdrew from the body and resumed commercial whaling months later, in defiance of international criticism. \u201cJapan is no longer party to the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling and can argue that it is no longer bound by provisions and constraints,\u201d Donald Rothwell, an international law professor at the Australian National University (ANU), told CNN. \u201cWithin its waters, it\u00a0has the absolute authority to control the management of living resources \u2013 and that includes whales.\u201d Under Japanese law, three species of whale are permitted to be hunted in its territorial waters and exclusive economic zones \u2013 endangered sei whales and threatened minke whales and Bryde\u2019s whales, with endangered fin whales set to be added to kill lists. \u201cWhales are important food resources and should be sustainably utilized based on scientific evidence,\u201d said government spokesperson Yoshimasa Hayashi this month, as he announced a proposal to hunt fin whales, the second-largest species of whales after blue whales. The World Cetacean Alliance (WCA) marine conservation group said that whale watching in Japan was \u201ca far more successful industry\u201d than harvesting whale meat. \u201cCommercial whaling in the 21st century is unjustifiable,\u201d it said. \u00a0\u201cThe whaling industry in Japan recognizes that it is a challenge to increase whale meat consumption and there is currently no market,\u201d WCA said. \u201cSo why keep slaughtering these wonderful and intelligent animals?\u201d Tokoro ruled out whale watching. \u201cWe will not switch to whale watching but eating whale meat while watching whales might be quite a nice touch,\u201d he told CNN. Demand for whale meat in Japan Over the years, Kyodo Senpaku has launched aggressive public relation campaigns to promote whale meat and win over new generations of young diners. Tokoro says he eats whale meat every day. \u201cWhale meat is not only delicious, it\u2019s good for you,\u201d Tokoro told reporters during the tour of his ship, as he talked\u00a0up the purported \u201chealth benefits\u201d of eating whale, claiming that the meat could cure hair loss and cancer. \u201cI can definitely say whale meat and rice is a really good (combination) for Japanese people. There is no doubt about that, much better than beef and bun.\u201d Last year Tokoro, again wearing his whale hat, launched controversial whale meat vending machines, offering whale sashimi, whale steak and whale bacon. The company has also sponsored influencers from countries such as Russia, Thailand and South Korea \u2013 hosting them at a local izakaya in Osaka, where they sampled dishes like whale sashimi and skewers and encouraging them to take the message back to their followers that whale meat was delicious and acceptable. Japan may have a long and storied history of whaling dating back to the Edo period in the 1600s, but experts say whale meat consumption only really peaked after World War II \u2013 when food sources, especially protein, were scarce. Today, whale meat is now\u00a0considered more of a \u201cluxury\u201d dish, said Nobuhiro Kishigami, a professor at the National Museum of Ethnology, one of the country\u2019s largest research institutes. \u201cThe fact is that there is little interest in whaling and whale meat among Japanese people as a whole,\u201d Kishigami told CNN. \u201cMost young people, especially the majority that live in cities, do not know or care much about whaling and its history and remain indifferent.\u201d The same goes for dolphin meat, he added. \u201cIt\u2019s just a sign of the times. But if we were asked to stop eating blue fin tuna, there would be a huge uproar. We would react very badly to that.\u201d Japan\u2019s fisheries ministry estimates that between 1,000 and 2,000 tons of whale meat are consumed annually in the country, compared to average annual totals of more than 230,000 tons during the 1960s. \u201cThere is still certainly a market (for whale meat in Japan) but market size and production volume have shrunk dramatically,\u201d economics professor Mitsuhiro Kishimoto from the Shimonoseki City University told CNN, noting that several major whaling companies had since withdrawn from the trade. \u201cThe demand for whale blubber disappeared after the discovery of oil and petroleum products, so many countries stopped whaling and with international regulations, the number of caught whales decreased and as a result, whale meat production decreased while beef, pork and chicken became more popular,\u201d he said. Scientists have also expressed\u00a0concern about the risks of consuming whale meat, with studies pointing to high levels of mercury found in whale and dolphin meat, which could prove dangerous to consumers \u2013 especially pregnant women and young children. Could Japanese whalers return to the Southern Ocean? Located in deep waters surrounding the entire continent of Antarctica, the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary hosts dozens of whale species including humpbacks, blue whales and fin whales. It was established by the IWC in 1994 to protect whale species after centuries of hunting, but until 2019 Japan took regular trips to the region to hunt for self-stated \u201cscientific research\u201d purposes. Japanese whalers killed 333 minke whales in the Southern Ocean in 2018/2019, according to the IWC, before abandoning the region after it left the international body. Takaaki Sakamoto, director of the Whaling Affairs Office in Japan\u2019s Fisheries Agency, told CNN that Japan sent ships to the Antarctic last year to collect numbers and skin surface samples, but those expeditions did not involve killing whales. He said they planned to return this year to do the same. Tokoro told CNN that the Kangei Maru is not planning on killing whales beyond Japanese waters because it doesn\u2019t make economic sense. \u201cCommercial whaling is not profitable,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will take 50 days to get to the Antarctic and back and we are not confident we can make a profit by paying the wages of employees and fuel for 50 days. However, I will go only when the government orders me to go \u2026 Until then, I will not go commercial whaling at all.\u201d Sea Shepherd, an international marine conservation activist group which spent years confronting Japanese whaling ships in the past, told CNN that it believes Japan is unlikely to return to the Southern Ocean because that would require it to rejoin the IWC \u2014 whose members are fiercely opposed to commercial whaling. But\u00a0other activists aren\u2019t so confident. \u201cGiven the ship\u2019s long-range capabilities and drones, and recent announcements from Japan\u2019s fisheries ministry that it is keen to start hunting fin whales, we believe there is a high likelihood that Japanese whalers will return to the Southern Ocean,\u201d said James Anderson, activist and founder of the Whale Defense Agency (WDA). \u201cThe Southern Ocean is a critical habitat for many whale species that provides a safe haven for breeding and feeding \u2026 protecting it is more important than ever due to the increasing threats posed by climate change and illegal whaling.\u201d Rothwell, from ANU, said that if Japan looks to kill whales beyond its territorial waters, it can expect an international response. \u201cIt would immediately trigger global interest and action about the conservation and protection of whales, especially in waters sanctioned by the IWC as a whale sanctuary,\u201d Rothwell said. Watson, the veteran anti-whaling activist who founded Sea Shepherd but has since left, told CNN he\u2019s prepared to mount a physical response \u2013 with a former Japanese fisheries patrol vessel he\u2019s acquired in anticipation of Japanese whalers returning to the Antarctic by the end of the year. \u201cIt\u2019s called the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary for a reason \u2013 you don\u2019t kill whales there,\u201d Watson said. \u201cWe want to be able to track them down and intercept them like we\u2019ve done before \u2013 and we are more than prepared to do it again.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/asia/japan-whaling-mothership-kangei-maru-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_06_06_europe_prince-william-king-charles-d-day-anniversary-intl", "text": "Britain\u2019s King Charles III embarked on his first overseas trip since being diagnosed with cancer, traveling across the English Channel for commemorations marking the 80th anniversary of the 1944 D-Day Landings in Normandy. Nearly 160,000 Allied troops landed on five stretches of the German-occupied Normandy coastline on June 6, 1944. Operation Overlord \u2013 as D-Day was codenamed \u2013 remains, to this day, the largest amphibious invasion in history, \ufeffand was a crucial turning point in defeating the Nazis in World War II. Omaha Beach was the deadliest of the landing sites as German forces were entrenched in fortified cliff positions above allowing them to fire on the first waves of US soldiers as they reached the shore. Nearly 10,000 Allied troops were killed or wounded on D-Day. Exact figures of German casualties on the day are not known, however it has been estimated to be between 4,000 and 9,000 service personnel. On Thursday morning, King Charles and Queen Camilla attended the UK Ministry of Defence and the Royal British Legion\u2019s commemorative event at the British Normandy Memorial at Ver-sur-Mer. Charles is patron of both the Royal British Legion and Normandy Memorial Trust. The King, wearing his\u00a0Field Marshal No 4 Tropical Service dress\u00a0uniform with medals and decorations, urged allies to \u201crecall lessons that come to us again and again,\u201d while addressing D-Day veterans. \u201cHow fortunate we were and the entire free world that a generation of men and women in the United Kingdom and other Allied nations did not flinch when the moment came to face that test,\u201d Charles said, adding that his grandfather, King George VI, described the events of D-Day as \u201cthe supreme test.\u201d Charles reflected on the qualities of the armed forces involved, saying they \u201ccarried out their duty with a humbling sense of resolve and determination.\u201d He also used the speech to reflect on the past through the lens of the present, saying: \u201cWe recall the lesson that comes to us again and again across the decades. Three nations must stand together to oppose tyranny.\u201d Charles also spoke in French, thanking the people of France for their \u201cwarmth\u201d and \u201cgenerosity\u201d towards D-Day veterans, which he said is the \u201cmost moving and memorable part of these anniversaries.\u201d While the King traveled to France for commemorations, he did not join world leaders - including Macron and his US counterpart Joe Biden \u2013 later Thursday as they gather at Omaha Beach to honor troops for their bravery and sacrifice eight decades ago. Instead, Prince William represented Britain\u2019s royal family at the international ceremony at Omaha Beach. The optics of seeing the Prince of Wales instead of his father will not have been be lost on those within the royal household, as well as royal-watchers. Nonetheless, CNN understands that it wasn\u2019t a deliberate orchestration. William, 41, has deputized for Charles before, such as when he traveled to Kuwait for the funeral of Emir Sheikh Nawaf al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah in December. However, seeing the future monarch in the company of other heads of state was a powerful visual and speaks to the longer transition which will prepare the public for King William V\u2019s reign. King Charles also only recently returned to public engagements after getting the green light from his doctors who were \u201cencouraged\u201d by his progress. He is continuing to receive treatment and each engagement the 75-year-old sovereign carries out is being reviewed and adapted where necessary by his medical team to ensure his continued recovery. That simple reason of following medical advice appears to be behind the King\u2019s absence at the international commemoration on Thursday afternoon. A royal source told CNN that it was considered a step too far at this stage but that the monarch was delighted the Prince of Wales was representing the nation. William has been an ever-present fixture as the royal family marked the D-Day anniversary in recent days. Earlier Thursday, the heir to the British throne paid tribute at the Canadian commemorative ceremony at the Juno Beach Centre in Courseulles-Sur-Mer, where he joined veterans as well as current serving personnel before making a speech and laying a wreath. A day earlier, William had joined Charles and Camilla at the UK\u2019s national commemorative event in Portsmouth. The city on England\u2019s south coast was one of the places Allied troops sailed from before the Normandy landings. William paid tribute to veterans who \u201ccame from across our nation and from all walks of life to join in the fight against tyranny. Many of those that took up arms had never seen combat before, some were still only in their teens.\u201d Meanwhile, in his own moving speech, King Charles told crowds that \u201cthe stories of courage, resilience and solidarity\u201d must not be forgotten and that they are a reminder \u201cof what we owe to that great wartime generation.\u201d Charles added: \u201cIt is our duty to ensure that we, and future generations, do not forget their service and their sacrifice.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/europe/prince-william-king-charles-d-day-anniversary-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_06_asia_north-korea-balloons-activists-kpop-intl-hnk", "text": "South Korean activists sent balloons carrying K-pop and K-dramas on USB sticks to their northern neighbor on Thursday, days after North Korean balloons of trash and \u201cfilth\u201d floated in the opposite direction. The activist group Fighters for a Free North Korea (FFNK) released the giant balloons in the early hours of Thursday morning, with videos showing them floating away, some dragging giant posters visible from afar while others carried smaller plastic packages. Inside the packages were 200,000 leaflets condemning North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, 5,000 USB sticks containing South Korean music videos and television shows, and 2,000 one dollar bills, according to FFNK. Groups such as FFNK have been sending these kinds of balloons for years, carrying items prohibited in the isolated totalitarian dictatorship \u2013 including food, medicine, radios, propaganda leaflets and pieces of South Korean news. In May, North Korea responded by sending its own giant balloons back south \u2013 containing trash, soil, pieces of paper and plastic, and what South Korean authorities described as \u201cfilth.\u201d Pyongyang claimed to have sent a total of 3,500 balloons carrying 15 tonnes of trash to its neighbor, according to state media KCNA, citing North Korea\u2019s Vice Defense Minister Kim Kang Il. Those balloons began landing in the South last week, temporarily disrupting flights and prompting authorities to warn residents to stay indoors. As of Monday, the South Korean military had found about 1,000 balloons. South Korean activists say they will continue to send the balloons north \u2013 even though doing so was banned by the government years ago. FFNK leader Park Sang-hak, a North Korean defector who fled to the South years ago, described the materials they sent as \u201cletters of truth and freedom.\u201d As a young man in North Korea, these balloons had offered him a rare glimpse into the outside world, he said. He recalled being in a public square in 1992 when \u201cI heard a huge balloon in the sky.\u201d \u201cThis round thing suddenly popped with a loud bang, then leaflets fell from the sky. I knew I wasn\u2019t supposed to look at those things, so I put one in my pocket and went to the bathroom to check it out,\u201d he said. The leaflet he pocketed contained stories about North Korean defectors and their escapes, some of whom had crossed into China before heading toward South Korea. Eight years later, Park fled the North \u2013 arriving in South Korea in 2000, and beginning his mission to send balloons across the border in 2006. The leaflets he sends carry information about the Kim family, including the assassination of the leader\u2019s half-brother Kim Jong Nam \u2014 as well as booklets about South Korea\u2019s economic and political development, including photos of the main Seoul airport and the country\u2019s fighter jets. \u201cSouth Korea is not an American colony or a wasteland of humanity like I learned in North Korea,\u201d he told CNN on Wednesday. \u201cWe sent money, medicine, facts, truth, and love, but to send filth and trash in return? That\u2019s an inhumane and barbaric act.\u201d Meanwhile, some South Korean residents living near the border are now on edge. \u201cI lived through the Korean War and other difficulties, and I was worried \u2026 What if we have another war?\u201d said 84-year-old Song Kwang-ja, a resident of Yongin city, on Thursday. \u201cThat reminded me of the old days. I still get goosebumps thinking and talking about it,\u201d she said, adding that the balloons \u201cfelt like a childish prank.\u201d The incident has also worsened strained relations between the two countries. South Korea announced this week it would resume \u201call military activities\u201d near the demarcation line \u2013 suspending a 2018 agreement signed by both nations at a brief time of relatively warm relations.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/asia/north-korea-balloons-activists-kpop-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "world"}}

The Russian \u201cfrigate Gorshkov, the nuclear-powered submarine Kazan, the fleet oil tanker Pashin, and the rescue tug Nikolai Chiker\u201d will visit the port of Havana between June 12 and 17, according to the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces in a statement published by the Foreign Ministry. Cuba says none of the ships carry nuclear weapons and insists their stopover does not represent a threat to the region. \u201cVisits by naval units from other countries are a historical practice of the revolutionary government with nations that maintain relations of friendship and collaboration,\u201d the statement added. Moscow has not confirmed the information provided by Cuba. CNN has reached out to the Russian government for comment. It\u2019s not the first time Russian Navy ships have been sent to Cuba, a key ally to the former Soviet Union during the Cold War that briefly hosted nuclear missiles at Moscow\u2019s behest during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. Last July, the Russian Navy\u2019s training class ship Perekop sailed into Havana for a four-day visit. The latest visit appears to be the largest of its kind in years. Cuba is increasingly reliant on Russian oil and aid as the communist-run country weathers its worst economic crisis in decades. Cuba\u2019s announcement comes days after US President Joe Biden gave Ukraine permission to carry out limited strikes inside Russian territory with American munitions. In response, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Western countries \u201csupplying weapons to a conflict zone is always a bad thing.\u201d \u201cIn the end, if we see that these countries become involved in a war against us, what they are doing makes them directly involved in a war against the Russian Federation, we reserve the right to act the same way,\u201d Putin said on Wednesday. Putin added that as a response, \u201cwe will improve our air defense systems to destroy the missiles.\u201d He also asked why Russia would \u201cnot have the right to supply our weapons of the same class to those regions of the world where there will be strikes on the sensitive facilities of those countries that are doing this against Russia?\u201d \u2018No direct threat\u2019 Russia\u2019s military is expected to increase its naval and air activity near the United States this summer as part of routine maneuvers in the lead up to a global naval exercise in the fall, according to the US State Department and the Pentagon. \u201cRussia is likely to send combat naval vessels to the Caribbean, with potential port calls in Cuba and possibly Venezuela,\u201d Pentagon spokesperson Maj. Charlie Dietz said on Thursday. \u201cAircraft deployments or flights in the region are also anticipated. These deployments are part of Russia\u2019s routine naval operations and pose no direct threat to the United States.\u201d Alongside Russian ships this summer will also be one of the Russian Navy\u2019s Severodvinsk II-class submarines, Dietz said. The port call for that submarine was approved \u201cat least in part due to Havana\u2019s displeasure\u201d over the visit of a US nuclear submarine to the US\u2019 Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba last year, he said. Cuba has hosted Russian ships every year between 2013 and 2020, Dietz said, adding that the exercises \u201cimpose a significant cost on the Russian Navy, which faces challenges in maintaining readiness and conducting deployments with an aging fleet.\u201d \u201cGiven Russia\u2019s long history of Cuban port calls, these are considered routine naval visits, especially in the context of increased US support to Ukraine and NATO exercises,\u201d Dietz said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/americas/cuba-russian-ships-submarine-visit-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "world"}}

And at next month\u2019s upcoming Games, Louis Vuitton are hoping they too will become a hallmark of the same grand occasion. The luxury house\u2019s distinctive Damier checkerboard trunks will house the Olympic torch as it travels across France, and Vuitton has created medal cases for the Olympic and Paralympic Games. Seven French athletes \u2014 from fencer Enzo Lefort and swimmer L\u00e9on Marchand to wheelchair tennis champion Pauline D\u00e9roul\u00e8de and para-cyclist Marie Patouillet \u2014 will also act as ambassadors for the brand. The Olympics, and the extraordinary journeys that athletes take to reach them, closely align with the values at the heart of the French luxury fashion house, its chairman and CEO Pietro Beccari told CNN in an interview at the brand\u2019s headquarters in Paris. \u201cWe talk about excellence, we spoke about quality, we spoke about being prepared for every challenge, and that is something that is very close to our heart,\u201d Beccari said, adding that Louis Vuitton is \u201cvery proud to be a French group\u201d and willing to support its home Olympics in the \u201cmost beautiful city in the world.\u201d As one would expect from a company who also designs the trophy trunks for such events as the soccer World Cup and the F1 Grand Prix de Monaco, these are no ordinary pieces of luggage. The interiors of both trunks are lined with matte black leather; one featuring circular \u201csockets\u201d in its base and lid to safely house and transport the Olympic torch, while the other contains enough drawers to store hundreds of medals. LVMH \u2013 the luxury conglomerate that owns Louis Vuitton \u2013 spent \u20ac150 million ($163 million) on its sponsorship deal with the Olympics, Vogue reported citing sources, though calculating the precise returns on this investment is \u201cdifficult,\u201d said Beccari.  \u201cWe believe this campaign is building values, building desirability,\u201d he said. \u201cQuantifying it is very difficult, not that we didn\u2019t try but it\u2019s very very difficult or impossible.\u201d The fashion house has long associated itself with sport, sponsoring nautical events like the Americas Cup, as well as launching a recent campaign centered around the friendship of tennis legends Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. \u201cWe are very close to sport,\u201d Beccari said, recalling the slogan \u201cVictory travels in Louis Vuitton,\u201d the fashion house used when one of its trunks housed the FIFA World Cup in 2010. \u201cI think it incarnates very well the DNA of Louis Vuitton, of what I was saying before, the challenges, the willingness to overcome yourself, to reach your destination and to be willing to go and discover more.\u201d This messaging underpinned a new campaign with Federer and Nadal sitting on a Louis Vuitton case on a snowy mountain in the Dolomites, discussing their rivalry, their biggest achievements and their sporting heroes. They\u2019re \u201ctwo beautiful young people that started from their little villages respectively in two different parts of Europe,\u201d Beccari said, \u201cand they became who they became so it\u2019s really part of this philosophy of excellence, of quality, of envy to surpass yourself over time again.\u201d While Louis Vuitton posted record profits last year and LVMH outperformed other luxury brands, the current economic environment with rising inflation leaving consumers with less disposable income poses challenges ahead, though Beccari downplayed such difficulties. \u201cIn terms of crisis, you always have to have the courage to see the opportunities and that\u2019s what we do,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there is a curve, and we like to do the curve with speed, so when the road will be straight again we\u2019ll have sufficient speed to be ahead of the others.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/style/louis-vuitton-pietro-beccari-olympics/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_02_europe_russia-defense-ministry-shakeup-intl", "text": "Removing a long-time defense minister from his post is nothing out of the ordinary. Arresting five of his senior staff, however, is clearly more than just a search for fresh blood \u2014 especially in Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia. After the shock ouster, two weeks ago, of Sergei Shoigu as the minister for defense, a wave of arrests has gutted the defense ministry\u2019s top brass under the guise of an anti-corruption campaign. The timing is as intriguing as the arrests and reshuffle. After almost three years of failure on the battlefields in Ukraine, Russia has just gained the upper hand. It has, in recent weeks, launched a largely successful offensive in the north, toward Kharkiv, coupled with victories in the Donbas region in the east, too. Ukraine\u2019s crippling manpower shortage and dwindling ammunition supplies \u2014 exacerbated by months of stalling in the US Congress to approve a military support package \u2014 have also helped reverse Russia\u2019s fortunes. So the question then is, why shake up the ministry in charge of winning the war now? Analysts who spoke to CNN described the defense ministry as one of the most corrupt in the country. Russian state media has been disclosing military contracts worth eye-watering sums of money and publicly shaming the ministry\u2019s senior officials and their lavish lifestyles. But as one analyst told CNN, what we are witnessing is a \u201cvery complex polycentric game,\u201d one that is related to timing and Putin\u2019s existential search for victory against the West. Prigozhin message from the grave Hanging over this shake-up is the ghost of Yevgeny Prigozhin, boss of the Wagner mercenary group, who was also formerly known as \u201cPutin\u2019s Chef.\u201d Before his death, he had expressed hatred for Shoigu and Russia\u2019s top general, Valery Gerasimov, through profanity-laden tirades, accusing them and the ministry of corruption and incompetence. Prigozhin led a mutiny on Moscow that was supposed to end with the overthrow of Shoigu and Gerasimov. Instead, he put the president in an awkward position and challenged his authority. Putin responded by describing Prigozhin as a traitor and stripped him of his assets, all before he died in a suspicious plane crash, alongside his most senior advisers. Since then, Putin has kept the inefficiencies of the ministry\u2019s weapons procurement, as well as its bungled invasion of Ukraine and corruption allegations, out of the public eye, keen to show he would not make any knee-jerk reactions following the mutiny. Doing so might question his authority and strength to the Russian people. Putin was likely awaiting his reelection by the Russian people in March before making moving in on the defense ministry. The changes came shortly after Victory Day celebrations on May 9, which Putin and Shoigu attended, side by side, in a seemingly amicable appearance. Despite his removal as defense minister, Shoigu will remain in Putin\u2019s orbit after being moved sideways to a new role as secretary of the security council. Putin\u2019s interests: Ukraine Tatiyana Stanovaya, Senior Fellow at Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, told CNN that whether Prigozhin may have been right about the officials\u2019 corruption is not what\u2019s important. In Russia, she said, \u201cright and wrong doesn\u2019t exist in politics \u2014 only interests matter.\u201d Putin\u2019s interest is in keeping his house in order but, more pressingly, achieving victory in Ukraine. The defense ministry is central to how that war ends. With Putin installing a civilian economist, Andrey Belousov, as the new defense minister, he has signaled he wants the ministry, with its vast budget, to procure weapons more quickly and economically. Russia\u2019s 2024 budget shows it is seeking to spend 6% of GDP on defense, the highest in modern Russian history, and will outpace social spending \u2014 a sign of the country\u2019s transition to a wartime economy. The corruption in question \u2013 Shamarin and Ivanov Mikhail Komin, a Russian political scientist and Visiting Fellow at the European Council of Foreign Affairs based in Vienna, told CNN that \u201cShoigu\u2019s group, among the Russian elites, is one of the most rent-seeking. More, for example, than some of Putin\u2019s inner circle.\u201d Last Friday, Lieutenant General Vadim Shamarin, chief of the Main Communication Directorate of the Russian Armed Forces, was charged with \u201creceiving a bribe on an especially large scale,\u201d of 36 million rubles (around $393,000) from a factory that supplies the ministry with communications equipment. In exchange, he is alleged to have awarded the company lucrative government contracts. Shamarin has pleaded not guilty, according to Russian state media. Russian state media has also played a role in communicating the Kremlin\u2019s crackdown on the ministry. Following Shamarin\u2019s arrest in May, state-run Ria Novosti reported that his wife had purchased a Mercedez-Benz GLE in 2018 for 20 million rubles (about $218,000) at a time when his income was no higher than $34,000. A separate report found her income that year was 872,000 rubles ($9,740). The highest profile of the five officials arrested was Timur Ivanov, the deputy defense minister. He was put under house arrest in late April, also on suspicion of taking bribes. Ivanov had become a focus of the Anti-Corruption Foundation, founded by Alexey Navalny, who was killed in a Russian prison in February. He and his organization exposed the lavish lifestyle enjoyed by Ivanov\u2019s partner \u2014 visiting invite-only jewelers, wearing couture clothing and owning a chalet in the chic ski resort of Courchevel in France. They questioned how she afforded such a lifestyle when her husband\u2019s salary was officially $175,000 a year. Russian state media reported that Ivanov maintains his innocence, citing its own source. There can\u2019t be overlap, but corruption will still remain For Stanovaya, the reasons for replacing figures such as Ivanov and Shamarin are simple. \u201cPart of Putin\u2019s logic is that you can\u2019t field someone in this position (as defense minister) where there are significant interests of the previous.\u201d To help clean up the ministry, Putin has appointed Oleg Savelyev, a former auditor at the Russia Accounts Chamber, as the deputy minister of defense. He will be \u201caware of the corruption that already exists in the defense sector,\u201d Komin said. Prigozhin\u2019s final wish Given the sweeping changes made by the president, rumors have swirled about the position of the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces, Valery Gerasimov, the other target of Prigozhin\u2019s rants. Stanovaya said, \u201cThere are so many rumors now that he [Gerasimov] might be dismissed soon,\u201d but the fact he has so far been spared gives Gerasimov \u201ca window to start fighting for his own interests,\u201d she added. \u201cGerasimov is fighting against his enemies, trying to secure his future,\u201d Stanovaya said. Komin agreed that Gerasimov may keep his position for now, as Putin has said he does not intend to make any other changes. Crucially, Komin suggested that Gerasimov\u2019s luck may be that there lacks a position, similar to Shoigu\u2019s where he can publicly be moved aside without completely tarnishing his reputation, \u201cit\u2019s not a big deal to find the new guy. It\u2019s more a big deal to find the place for the previous guy.\u201d In Putin\u2019s Russia the president remains laser focused on winning in Ukraine, but recent overtures have shown that the supporting cast may change and the president is ready to be ruthless in his search of victory.

Russia\u2019s Foreign Ministry on Wednesday posted a photo of Lavrov in Ouagadougou, noting that he had been received by acting President Ibrahim Traor\u00e9. Lavrov was accompanied on the trip by Russian Deputy Defense Minister Yevkurov. Burkina\u00a0Faso is\u00a0currently under military rule\u00a0after a junta staged a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in July 2022. Its junta, headed by Traor\u00e9, has said it is prioritizing building up security\u00a0amid an ongoing and deadly internal conflict. Violence-related deaths in\u00a0Burkina\u00a0Faso doubled last year, according to the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC). So far in 2024, hundreds of civilians have already been killed in attacks this year, including around 170 in three villages\u00a0in March, and approximately 30 in separate mosque and church attacks\u00a0in February. Engulfed in violence, Burkina\u00a0Faso has been named the world\u2019s most neglected displacement crisis for the second year, by the NRC. In 2024, 6.3 million people in the country will need humanitarian assistance, the aid organization said, with over two million people internally displaced. US officials have warned for years now that both Russia and China are working to build influence in Africa. In 2019, the former head of US Africa Command, Gen. Thomas Waldhauser also said that Russia was using mercenaries and arms sales to gain access to natural resources in Africa. Isolated from much of the world due to its invasion of Ukraine, Russia appears to be renewing overtures in the continent. In early March of this year, Africa Command again warned Congress that Russia was aggressively working to expand its footing in Africa, and that several countries were \u201cat the tipping point\u201d of falling under its influence.

{"id": "2024_06_05_africa_jacob-zuma-comeback-south-africa-elections-intl", "text": "South Africa\u2019s African National Congress (ANC) party faces a mammoth challenge as it needs to form a government with its political rivals after suffering a seismic blow in last week\u2019s election. On Wednesday, the ANC\u2019s national spokesperson insisted that any coalition government would be in the interests of unity and stability and hinted at a government of national unity of some kind. \u201cThe ANC has taken the position that we must all act in the interest of our country and its people, and work on a national consensus on the form of government that is best suited to move South Africa forward at this moment in our history,\u201d Mahlengi Bhengu-Motsiri told a press briefing. Still, some of the same parties that sought the ANC\u2019s demise will now have to play a part in governing South Africa. For decades, the ANC could rule alone, but support for the the party plummeted to around 40% in last Wednesday\u2019s elections, down from 57% in 2019. Analysts and opinion polls had forecast losses for the ANC but a pivotal factor in the party\u2019s staggering decline was former President Jacob Zuma and his newly formed uMkhonto weSizwe (MK) party, which capitalized on widespread discontent within the ANC\u2019s traditional voter base. Zuma\u2019s revenge Zuma \u2013 a fierce critic of current ANC leader and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa \u2013 was forced to resign as president in 2018 and has been looking for political revenge ever since. His MK party, named after the ANC\u2019s former armed wing, appears to have achieved just that \u2013 formed just five months ago, it is now the third-largest party in South Africa, receiving almost 15% of the vote. Zuma positioned MK as \u201ca party that is meant to restore the ANC to its former glory,\u201d said political analyst Tessa Dooms, programmes director at the Rivonia Circle non-profit organization/political think tank in Johannesburg. She says many MK voters saw this ballot as a protest vote. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen with the MK party is the use of a vote to send a signal to the ANC of the level of unhappiness, not only of the country itself but within its ranks who\u2019ve supported it over the last 30 years,\u201d Dooms told CNN. Despite Zuma being barred from running for parliament by the Constitutional Court because of a previous contempt of court violation, the 82-year-old\u2019s\u00a0face remained on the ballot paper. Zuma is no stranger to controversy or the courtroom. He\u202fhas faced\u202fhundreds of corruption, fraud and racketeering charges\u202fover the years. He has always denied all of them and became known as the \u201cTeflon President\u201d because few politicians could have survived the scandals he weathered. Ramaphosa replaced him as president when Zuma was finally forced to resign. Later revelations of \u201cstate capture\u201d \u2013 or rampant corruption riveted the nation in an anti-corruption commission. Much of the focus was on Zuma\u2019s relationship with the influential and wealthy Gupta brothers. With the ANC\u2019s popularity now at an all-time low and as Ramaphosa\u2019s political future hangs in the balance, Zuma could have the last laugh. But it is too early to tell. Due to the poor election showing, South Africa\u2019s political landscape has been fundamentally altered, leaving the ANC with the daunting task of forming a coalition government. In many countries, coalition talks can take months, but South Africa\u2019s constitution gives rival parties a short window to do something they have never really done before: come together. According to the constitution, rival parties have a mere 14 days to create a coalition after the final election results are announced. The outcome of these talks will likely\u00a0determine Ramaphosa\u2019s future as president. Ramaphosa\u2019s\u00a0allies\u00a0in the party are digging in. On Sunday, ANC Secretary-General Fikile Mbalula warned potential coalition partners that the president\u2019s resignation is \u201cnot going to happen.\u201d \u201cI think the ANC has many factors to consider in terms of how it forms a government \u2013 both the stability of the country at large but also for the sake of having a government that still holds to the values of the ANC that it has long said that it serves,\u201d Dooms told CNN. The potential coalition partners present starkly different political ideologies and policy priorities. A marriage of convenience First, there is the official opposition Democratic Alliance (DA), a broadly centrist and pro-business party that has heavily criticized the ANC for many years. Led by John Steenhuisen, it is seen by many\u00a0as a party for White South Africans, something the DA rejects. Steenhuisen has not ruled out going into a coalition with the ANC. A DA-ANC alliance, however it would form, would likely keep Ramaphosa in his job, say analysts. \u201cThe only way Ramaphosa stays is through a DA-ANC coalition.\u00a0Outside that,\u00a0the other parties, MK and EFF\u00a0(Economic Freedom Fighters), have made it clear the first point of negotiation is he must go,\u201d said TK Pooe, a senior lecturer at Wits School of Governance. If the ANC were to pair with the DA, which\u202freceived 21.8% of the vote, their combined support would amount to more than 60%, an outright majority. However, this relationship would require both parties to make some major compromises. While in government, the ANC\u2019s flagship policy for driving economic inclusion and racial equality in post-apartheid South Africa has been its Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment policy, known as triple-BEE or simply BEE. The\u202fBEE policy has been criticized\u202fby some as neither broad-based, nor empowering. In contrast, the DA has\u202fsaid\u202fit would replace BEE with an \u201cEconomic Justice Policy\u201d that \u201ctargets the poor black majority for redress, rather than a small, connected elite.\u201d The DA is also against the ANC\u2019s flagship National Health Insurance Act (NIH) in its current form. The act, which was signed into law two weeks before the election, seeks to provide universal health care for all and gradually limit the role of private health insurers. However, both parties believe in the primacy of South Africa\u2019s constitution and both have promised to crack down on corruption. Awkwardly, the DA is currently\u202fpressing corruption charges\u202fagainst the ANC\u2019s deputy president,\u00a0Paul Mashatile. In a move to appease internal critics, the ANC-DA coalition could be expanded to include smaller parties, or the ANC could form a minority government with a \u201cconfidence-and-supply\u201d agreement with opposition partners like the DA and the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), where they remain outside of government but support it on key votes in exchange for policy concessions. A bitter pill to swallow? If the ANC decides\u00a0to pursue coalition talks with MK, then Zuma will want Ramaphosa out, solidifying his revenge. However, if South Africa\u2019s president maintains his grip on the ANC, a coalition with MK is unlikely. The MK party\u2019s manifesto also\u00a0demands an overhaul of the country\u2019s constitution to restore more powers to traditional leaders. Zuma \u201cunapologetically focused his campaign around Zulu nationalism and that was a constituency that was easy for him to target,\u201d\u202fpolitical\u00a0analyst and former ANC\u00a0lawmaker\u00a0Melanie Verwoerd told CNN. By appealing to his Zulu base, Zuma\u2019s party has also stirred ethnic and tribal tensions, a strategy that, while electorally effective, risks deepening divisions in South Africa, Verwoerd added. The ANC\u2019s policies, grounded in the principles of non-racial and non-tribal governance, are at odds with this approach. It is also currently unclear how much MK actually wants to govern. Despite doing well at the polls, the party has demanded a re-run, threatened court action, and suggested boycotting the first sitting of Parliament. However,\u00a0it has provided no evidence of\u00a0voting\u00a0irregularities. The other option for a coalition is the EFF,\u00a0led by former ANC youth leader Julius Malema, who was expelled from the party more than a decade ago. The breakaway party espouses land expropriation without compensation and sweeping state nationalism, including nationalizing the Reserve Bank. Malema has said\u202fhe would give the EFF vote to the ANC on the condition that his deputy, Floyd Shivambu, becomes Minister of Finance in an effort to control fiscal policy. South Africa\u2019s business community and middle class are broadly nervous about an EFF\u2013ANC coalition and its effect on investor confidence. The DA calls it part of a\u00a0\u201cdoomsday\u201d option because of the potential impact on investment and trade. The EFF won just under 10% of the vote, so any coalition with the ANC would need to include at least another party in the mix to give it a healthy majority. The IFP, with almost 4% of the vote, could be such a kingmaker. Aside from a classic coalition deal or a \u201cconfidence and supply\u201d agreement, another hypothetical option on the table would be a \u201cgovernment of national unity\u201d (GNU), bringing in all the major parties. This scenario would hark back to the post-apartheid era when South Africa operated under a GNU to oversee the new constitution,\u00a0led by Mandela as president and FW de Klerk and Thabo Mbeki as deputy presidents,\u00a0between April 1994 and February 1997. With less than two weeks\u00a0to finalize coalition agreements, South Africa\u2019s political future remains uncertain; the ANC must navigate this complex landscape to form a stable government and address the challenges that have led to its diminished support, while Ramaphosa\u2019s leadership hangs in the balance amidst Zuma\u2019s dramatic comeback.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/africa/jacob-zuma-comeback-south-africa-elections-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_07_middleeast_gaza-humanitarian-aid-israel-dg-intl", "text": "Raed Redwan shades his three-month-old baby from the heat and shoos away insects in a tent in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza. They are trapped, along with his wife and mother, in a sea of displaced families with little respite from overcrowding and pollution. The Palestinian father told CNN he struggles to find aid. Instead, he and his family have no choice but to drink contaminated water and eat just one meal per day. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about food because there is none,\u201d he said in a written message on June 5. \u201cWe survived the death from rockets and shelling; will we die of famine? After eight months of Israel\u2019s bombardment in Gaza \u2014 following the October 7 attacks led by the militant group Hamas that killed around 1,200 people and captured 250 hostages in southern Israel \u2014 human rights groups have described \u201cunspeakable\u201d living conditions for Palestinians in the enclave, with over 75% of the population displaced, according to the UN\u2019s agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA). Israel\u2019s military campaign has pulverized neighborhoods, damaged health infrastructure and depleted food, water and fuel supplies. The Israeli offensive has killed at least 36,654 Palestinians and injured another 83,309 people, according to Gaza\u2019s Ministry of Health. CNN cannot independently confirm these figures. While Israeli officials have insisted there is no limit on the amount of aid that can enter Gaza, the UN has accused authorities of imposing \u201cunlawful restrictions\u201d on relief operations such as blocked land routes, communications blackouts and air strikes. Local staffers told CNN they are forced to turn away the needy at distribution points because there is not enough relief to hand out. Here is a breakdown of how the aid crisis has deepened in the territory after 245 days of war. Crossing closures nearly halt all aid Israel\u2019s restrictions on land routes into Gaza\u00a0meant aid was barely trickling into the strip. But the crisis became even more dire early last month, after Israeli forces launched an assault in the southern city of Rafah and seized control of the Palestinian side of the land crossing into Egypt. The UN\u2019s food agency said ongoing attacks have blocked access to its main warehouse in Rafah since May 9, forcing them to suspend distributions there for nearly a month now. The agency expressed concerns for Palestinians in the south as the closure of the key Rafah crossing has severely limited food supplies reaching the area, recalling the dire food insecurity in northern Gaza after previous closures. Similarly, US-based non-profit World Central Kitchen paused operations at its main facility\u00a0in Rafah and relocated north last week. The US military\u2019s temporary maritime corridor into the strip was\u00a0repaired Friday. The operation was dealt a major blow in May after only a few operational weeks, when a $320 million makeshift pier sustained damage in stormy seas off the Gaza coast, according to the Pentagon. The resulting overall quantity of aid entering Gaza has since dropped by 67%, according to the UN, to a daily average of 58 trucks between May 7 and May 28. For comparison, the UN previously reported that an average 500 trucks entered the strip per day in the months before October 7. \u201cEverything that has been in place in the Rafah and Kerem Shalom crossings has now changed,\u201d said Louise Wateridge a communications officer for UNRWA. \u201cWhen these crossings have been interrupted, it\u2019s just simply not enough coming from any other sources.\u201d Trucks stuck at the border Scenes have emerged of large relief trucks piling up at the border with Gaza, after Israeli authorities ramped up inspections on relief convoys entering the strip\u201a doubling down on claims that such aid could be used by Hamas. COGAT, the Israeli agency that manages aid flow into Gaza, said on June 4 that more than 1,000 trucks are waiting to be picked up by the UN on the Palestinian side of the Kerem Shalom crossing \u2013 accusing the UN of failing to coordinate the entry of the vehicles into Gaza. But rights groups say the \u201csystematic obstruction at Israeli-controlled crossing points\u201d and increased fighting is paralyzing truck deliveries. Wateridge told CNN that trucks stuck at Kerem Shalom cannot be received due to intense military action on the Gazan side of the crossing. \u201cIt\u2019s just a complete waste of vital humanitarian aid, and it\u2019s such a manmade situation,\u201d she said. These distribution challenges come as the UN\u2019s food agency warned in May that Palestinians in the north are under a \u201cfull-blown famine\u201d that is spreading south. More than one million people, half of Gaza\u2019s population, are \u201cexpected to face death and starvation\u201d by mid-July, another UN report warned this week, as civilians struggle to find enough food amid scarce market supplies and rising prices. More than 7,000 children under the age of five have already been diagnosed with malnutrition, according to the UN\u2019s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. With aid stocks in rapid decline, workers can barely meet demands on the ground, according to Mahmoud Shalabi, the senior program manager of the NGO Medical Aid for Palestinians. \u2018No safe corridors\u2019 for humanitarians For the few aid trucks that do enter the strip, damaged roads from Israeli strikes and security concerns over ongoing hostilities are stifling attempts to reach displaced Palestinians, human rights workers told CNN. Relief agencies have repeatedly called for new entry routes, more trucks to get through daily border checks, fewer obstacles to the movement of humanitarian workers and guarantees for their safety. Israeli attacks on aid convoys have sparked fierce condemnation from rights groups, drawing attention to growing Western skepticism of Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. Since October 7, Israeli forces have struck known locations of aid workers in the enclave at least eight times, despite agencies providing their coordinates \u201cto ensure their protection,\u201d according to Human Rights Watch (HRW). The attacks \u201creveal fundamental flaws with the so-called deconfliction system, meant to protect aid workers,\u201d according to the report. CNN previously asked the Israeli military for a response to the HRW report. \u201cIt\u2019s really unsafe for us humanitarians, there are no safe corridors, no movement coordinations,\u201d said Shalabi. Shalabi says he, his wife and children have been forced to flee at least three times since October. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what\u2019s going to happen next,\u201d he added. \u201cI hope I will be able to return to my home and resume whatever life I had before I was displaced.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/middleeast/gaza-humanitarian-aid-israel-dg-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_03_americas_mexico-claudia-sheinbaum-challenges-intl-latam", "text": "Claudia Sheinbaum won a landslide victory to become the first female president of Mexico and first Jewish person in the role, adding to the growing list of accolades to the climate scientist and former mayor of Mexico City. But\u00a0when\u00a0she formally takes office in October,\u00a0how\u00a0will\u00a0she\u00a0tackle the biggest challenges facing the country as concerns about its security and the future of its democracy loom large? Complicating her administration\u2019s debut,\u00a0Sheinbaum will also have to contend with the shadow of her polarizing mentor, the outgoing President Andres Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, from the same Morena party. Sunday\u2019s vote was widely seen as a referendum on L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s term. And while his popular social welfare policies have helped push many Mexicans above the poverty line, experts say his security measures have done little to address the expanding reach of organized crime in the country. In a speech following the election, Sheinbaum promised to govern for all and to be an investor-friendly president. \u201cWe know that dissent is part of democracy. And although the majority of the people support our project, our duty is and will always be to look after each and every one of the Mexicans without distinction,\u201d she said as she struck a conciliatory tone at the end of the highly partisan race. \u201cSo, although many Mexicans do not fully agree with our project, we will have to walk in peace and harmony to continue building a fair and more prosperous Mexico.\u201d She promised a government \u201cwithout corruption or impunity\u201d and guided by \u201crepublican austerity, financial and fiscal discipline and autonomy of the Bank of Mexico.\u201d A victory for the Morena party While Sheinbaum\u2019s victory was widely expected this weekend, the \u201cbiggest story of last night\u201d was that the Morena party looked set to gain supermajorities in both houses of Congress,\u00a0said\u00a0Carin Zissis, a Mexico expert, and editor-in-chief of the Americas Society/Council\u2019s website. On Monday morning, the Mexican peso slipped roughly 3% against the US dollar amid rising concern that the ruling party will have a clear path to pass controversial constitutional reforms sought by L\u00f3pez Obrador. The reforms include a range of issues in areas like pensions and the energy sector, but they also include controversial judicial and institutional reforms,\u00a0which critics say\u00a0would weaken the separation of powers and see the disappearance of some independent regulatory agencies. \u201cWe have to see what happens when she comes into office: There has been a history of Mexican presidents breaking the path of their predecessors, even when their predecessors more or less selected them,\u201d Zissis said, adding: \u201cThough, [Sheinbaum] has pledged throughout her campaign to continue his legacy.\u201d L\u00f3pez Obrador has pushed back on suggestions that he would be giving Sheinbaum cues, saying on Monday that he would not \u201cinfluence\u201d his prot\u00e9g\u00e9.\u00a0Sheinbaum is now \u201cthe one empowered to make all the decisions,\u201d he said. One of Sheinbaum\u2019s biographers, journalist Jorge Zepeda, has\u00a0speculated\u00a0that, once in office, Sheinbaum will unfurl her own platform gradually: she will first act as \u201cthe faithful disciple of the leader,\u201d before offering \u201cglimpses\u201d of her own program, taking care not to stoke instability in the movement\u2019s base. Gang violence and security Violence has dominated this year\u2019s election, with dozens of candidates murdered in the run-up to the vote and gangs trying to influence who was coming to power. Sheinbaum inherits a tragic epidemic of unsolved disappearances in the country:\u00a0More than 100,000 Mexicans and migrants have disappeared, with no explanation of their fate for families.\u00a0According to the think tank\u00a0Mexico Evalua,\u00a0around 95%\u00a0of all crimes nationwide\u00a0went unsolved\u00a0in the country in\u00a02022. Mexico also remains a dangerous place to be a woman and is \u201csadly, known for high levels of femicide gender-based violence where the number of disappeared women has gone up and up year to year,\u201d Stephanie Brewer, Mexico Director at the Washington Office for Latin America (WOLA), told CNN. With security at the top of voters\u2019 concerns, Sheinbaum\u00a0has pointed to her record as Mexico City mayor, with her team crediting her for improvements to the police\u2019s pay, working conditions and intelligence-gathering capabilities \u2013 although there is some debate as to how much impact these measures had on bringing down the crime rate, experts said. But will\u00a0Sheinbaum\u2019s tactics as mayor of\u00a0Mexico City\u00a0be replicable\u00a0at the federal level and in Mexico\u2019s 31 states, home to more than 126 million people?\u00a0She will have to tackle a landscape\u00a0where criminal groups have expanded their reach. An hour away from Mexico City, in the state of Morelos, Will Freeman, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said he was told that organized criminal groups had \u201ctheir own political candidates\u201d in the town of Cuautla who could rely on armed wings to intimidate other people. Gangs in the country have also diversified to sectors beyond the illicit manufacture of drugs.\u00a0\u201cThey\u2019re doing illegal logging, illegal mining. They\u2019re taking control of the water supply, which is increasingly scarce,\u201d Freeman said. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s\u00a0term saw the expansion of the militarization of public security to tackle crime, a two-decades-long approach that\u00a0has coincided with historically high levels of homicides. A\u00a0May\u00a0report by the Crisis Group\u00a0found official corruption and collusion was hampering effective law enforcement. (CNN has yet to receive comment from Mexican Secretary of Defense and the president\u2019s office over the findings.) Sheinbaum has largely remained coy about her security programs, but has said \u201cthat at the national level we can advance even more in terms of security,\u201d she said in a\u00a0tweet on X, which listed out her security strategy that included the consolidation of the National Guard, strengthened intelligence and research, and better\u00a0coordination between the police, state prosecutors\u2019 offices and the attorney general\u2019s office. Where Washington and Mexico City meet Sheinbaum has\u00a0previously signaled\u00a0the importance of the US-Mexico relationship, especially around trade. \u201cWith the United States there will be a relationship of friendship, respect, mutual respect and equality as it has been until now, and we will always defend the Mexicans who are on the other side of the border,\u201d she said late on Sunday, local time. But analysts note there will probably be differences between US and Mexico when it comes to foreign policy.\u00a0Sheinbaum is from the ideological and political left, and \u201cI think she will be as friendly as L\u00f3pez Obrador towards Cuba, Venezuela, Nicaragua [and] will not probably take the geopolitical positions the US would hope for\u201d over Gaza and Ukraine, Freeman said. L\u00f3pez Obrador has angered advocates\u00a0on both sides\u00a0of the Israel and Gaza conflict.\u00a0Mexico has ruled out breaking diplomatic relations with Israel, in contrast to some of its Latin American counterparts, but it has also sought to join South Africa\u2019s genocide case against Israel. Sheinbaum\u00a0condemned\u00a0the violence following Hamas\u2019 October 7 attack on Israel and has\u00a0previously\u00a0called for a Palestinian state. In a 2009 letter to the editor of a Mexican newspaper, Sheinbaum wrote that many of her relatives from her grandparent\u2019s generation \u201cwere exterminated in the concentration camps.\u201d She added that \u201cbecause of my Jewish origin, because of my love for Mexico and because I feel like a citizen of the world, I share with millions the desire for justice, equality, fraternity and peace, and therefore, I can only see with horror the images of the state bombings,\u201d referring to an Israeli bombing campaign of Gaza that year. \u201cNo reason justifies the murder of Palestinian civilians,\u201d she wrote in\u00a0La Jornada. A partner to the US on migration? Sheinbaum will assume office just a month before Americans head to the polls in November, where immigration is a top issue on the ballot for candidates President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump \u2013\u00a0both of whom have\u00a0relied heavily on Mexico to step up immigration enforcement and help stem the flow of migration to the US southern border. While migration across the countries\u2019 1,933 miles long border is a shared concern,\u00a0migration is not a major issue among Mexican voters, Zissis said. Still, under L\u00f3pez Obrador, the Mexican government has accepted US deportations of tens of thousands of non-Mexican citizens under a 2023 Biden administration rule. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s administration\u00a0also stepped up efforts to block the path of migrants heading to the US by transporting large numbers of people from the north of Mexico to the south. But while Mexico\u2019s policies may have become a \u201cmajor factor\u201d\u00a0in reducing\u00a0some\u00a0migrant crossing\u00a0at\u00a0the United States\u2019 southern border, Brewer said it is \u201cnot a sustainable model for anyone\u201d \u2013 especially\u00a0not for\u00a0migrants who\u00a0are often targeted for\u00a0violence in Mexico. Will Sheinbaum keep up Mexico\u2019s assistance to US immigration policy?\u00a0The transition of power\u00a0is likely now\u00a0raising\u00a0uncertainty in the minds of some Biden officials about what\u00a0could\u00a0change\u00a0with its key partner\u00a0at the border.

{"id": "style_omar-diop-lee-shulman-being-there", "text": "In 1967 romcom \u201cGuess Who\u2019s Coming To Dinner,\u201d Sidney Poitier\u2019s dashing doctor is dropped into the lives of the Draytons, a White middle class family, when their daughter arrives home and announces she has a fianc\u00e9. The parents are liberals, but the news is shocking; they\u2019re not sure if they approve of an interracial marriage. No matter that this man is handsome and of spotless character \u2013 he\u2019s Sidney Poitier, for crying out loud \u2013 his presence, in all its Blackness, marks an intrusion, upending this hitherto White space. Now imagine we know nothing about the Draytons. They could be civil rights campaigners or conservatives or card-carrying members of the KKK. And no Hollywood ending is guaranteed. That is the provocative space a puckish Omar Victor Diop finds himself in in \u201cBeing There.\u201d Conceived by British photographer Lee Shulman and Senegalese self-portraitist Diop, the series sees the duo utilize a collection of family photos from 1950s and 1960s America, editing Diop into a series of intimate scenes, both public and private, in spaces where Black people were often shut out. The 60 or so photos, Kodachrome slides purchased on eBay by Shulman years ago, are drawn from his \u201cAnonymous Project,\u201d so named because Shulman has no idea of the identities of any of the people in them. The collection has spurred on multiple side projects, including a book with British photographer Martin Parr, and now \u201cBeing There,\u201d which debuted at Paris Photo in November 2023 and was recently turned into a coffee table book. \u201cBeing There\u201d came to life when Shulman noticed many of the slides contained an empty seat \u2013 presumably that the photographer had vacated to take the photo. \u201cThere was an absence,\u201d he told CNN in a joint video interview with Diop. That they were taken in America circa the civil rights movement, but also of a segregated South, \u201cplayed on my mind a lot,\u201d he explained. That absence became abstracted. The person missing from the seat evolved into a totem of worlds and peoples often excluded from the privileges of White America. \u201cEvery time I saw that chair, I saw Omar in (it),\u201d Shulman added. Though the two photographers had never met, it tracks. Shulman owned a few works from the acclaimed self-portraitist, who has prior experience in this area. Diop\u2019s series \u201cDiaspora\u201d depicts Africans outside of Africa at different points in history (albeit with some contemporary \u2013 often soccer related \u00ad\u00ad\u2013 props). That sense of play and humor continues in \u201cBeing There,\u201d in which an oft-grinning Diop offers a cheeky presence in each still. Shulman and Diop curated the selection together. \u201cWe were looking for images that covered a broad spectrum of life, because it\u2019s a family photo album,\u201d said Shulman. There are signs of wealth: a ski holiday, a Hawaiian jaunt, a trip to the Grand Canyon, alongside more modest adventures like a roadside picnic and a day at the zoo. The camera goes inside homes, capturing Diop in the back of birthday celebrations and lounging with families. However quotidian, that these moments were captured by cameras is a sign of race and class privilege, argued Shulman. Other photographs, by nature of their location, are more charged. Diop splashes around in a public swimming pool; graduates from college; sits in a busy bar. He\u2019s surrounded by White faces as he does so, occupying spaces which were historically segregated in some states. \u201cThe political potential of this series made it very easy for me to jump into this,\u201d Diop said. \u201cWe tend to have this glamorized gaze towards history. And in doing so, we forget how it\u2019s easy not to make room for someone who\u2019s different,\u201d he added. \u201c(The series) is an invitation to look at our lives nowadays and see how many people different from us that we allow into our intimate circles.\u201d Ironically, inserting Diop into these spontaneous shots involved a lot of planning. Period props and costumes were used by Diop in a greenscreen set, with rigs mimicking the lighting of each slide. Digital post-production slotted him into the photographs, approximating the grade and grain of Kodachrome film, along with any shadows, blur and movement in the shot. Dressing up, Diop was struck by how much he looked like his father, who \u201claughed a lot going through the book,\u201d the portraitist said. \u201cHe\u2019d been a student in Europe in the late \u201950s, so he\u2019d been sitting at these tables,\u201d Diop added. \u201cOf course, you can\u2019t really compare (being an African in Europe) with what African Americans went through in the same era, but the idea of being different is something (they had in common).\u201d The collaborators never decided whether Diop is playing the same character in each photograph, or if it was a character at all, and not just Diop appearing as a time traveller. This ambiguity carries over into Diop\u2019s relationship with the lens. \u201cOne of the reasons it works is that gaze he sometimes has towards the camera,\u201d said Shulman, \u201cyou feel that he knows the photographer.\u201d On the other hand, if it\u2019s a case of Diop breaching the space-time continuum, photographs read as if he\u2019s bringing the viewer in on the secret. Likewise, neither resolved whether Diop was a welcome presence or gate-crasher in each scene. Despite having the slides in his possession for years, Shulman still knows next to nothing about their subjects. \u201cAs much as they\u2019re anonymous, they tell us a lot,\u201d he insisted. \u201cEvery time I look at these images, even without Omar in them, I feel these people are looking at us and telling us something about history.\u201d There is another, perhaps unintended, dimension to the photographs. The anonymity of the White people, and Shulman and Diop\u2019s lack of desire to investigate them and their inner lives, forces the viewer to rely on sign and symbol to construct identity. We don\u2019t know their politics, nor how they\u2019d respond to Diop\u2019s presence. Deprived of details, these lives become homogenized; bundled. In doing so, they\u2019re treated like so many people of color were when portrayed by what was, for decades, a hegemonic Western \u2013 and almost exclusively White \u2013 lens, which had a knack for stripping away nuance. Diop\u2019s winking presence, Black and African, seems to say, \u201cLook where I am\u201d but also, \u201cSee how you like it.\u201d Shulman insisted \u201cthere\u2019s no pointing fingers in this book,\u201d while later saying neither he nor Diop \u201cfeel like we own this project\u201d now that\u2019s out in the world and \u201clives its life.\u201d All interpretations are valid, a fact they say excites them. More than 60 years after the photos were taken, much of America appears different now. Gently probing, playfully satirical, Shulman and Diop remind us that much remains the same. \u201cIt\u2019s a very contemporary project,\u201d Shulman said. \u201cIt has a lot of relevance to the world we live in today.\u201d \u201cBeing There\u201d is published by Textuel and available now.", "source": "http://cnn.com/style/omar-diop-lee-shulman-being-there/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_06_weather_california-heat-dome-west-record-climate", "text": "A searing heat dome will reach peak intensity Thursday afternoon and usher in the hottest day of the year so far for millions in the western US. Temperatures Thursday topped out up to 25 degrees above what\u2019s normal for the time of the year, making it feel like a hot July day in many locations. Heat will continue through the weekend before easing off a bit early next week. However, many typically hot areas in the West will still have to contend with temperatures up to 10 degrees above normal. A robust heat dome \u2013 a large area of high pressure that parks over an area, traps air and heats it with abundant sunshine for days or weeks \u2013 is driving this prolonged, unseasonable heat. TRACK IT: Where the heat will be hottest this week The temperatures will be dangerous for those exposed to the elements and unable to cool off.\u00a0Relief from the heat won\u2019t be found at night, either \u2013 another symptom of a world warming\u00a0due to fossil fuel pollution. Excessive heat warnings are in effect for more than 18 million people in California, Nevada, Arizona and Utah. A majority of these warnings, which are the most extreme form of heat alert issued by the National Weather Service, remain active through Friday. Heat has already taken its toll. Multiple people in different parts of the US have died due to heat-related illnesses since last weekend. Four migrants died \u201cfrom heat stroke and dehydration\u201d while triple digit temperatures baked the US-Mexico border last weekend, according to the US Border Patrol, El Paso Sector. In the East, a 59-year-old man died of heat-related complications in Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland, officials said Wednesday. Additional details about the man\u2019s death, which was the state\u2019s first heat-related death of the year, were not released. Heat also proved challenging for firefighters battling a blaze in California\u2019s Napa County Wednesday. Four firefighters were sent to area hospitals for injuries related to difficult terrain and \u201chot summer conditions,\u201d according to\u00a0CAL Fire\u2019s Sonoma-Lake-Napa Unit. All four are expected to make full recoveries. More than a dozen daily high temperature records fell earlier this week in the West as the heat dome strengthened. A few dozen more could be broken through the weekend. Flagstaff, Arizona; Reno, Nevada; and Fresno, California, are just a handful of cities where the day\u2019s high temperature record could fall on one or more days this week. Phoenix sizzled Wednesday but fell just short of its first 110-degree day of the year, a threshold it blew past Thursday as it soared to 113 degrees, also smashing the city\u2019s previous record for the day by 2 degrees. High temperatures hit 111 degrees in Las Vegas, tying this year with 2010 for the earliest such reading on record in the city. Death Valley, the hottest place in the world, clocked in with a temperature of 122 degrees, topping a daily record of 121 degrees it set back in 1996. Even the brutal desert landscape doesn\u2019t typically get this hot until mid-to-late June. Triple-digit temperatures will persist in California\u2019s Central Valley into the weekend with 110s sticking around in desert areas of California, Nevada and Arizona. Summerlike heat will expand northward Friday and reach the Northwest. Records could be broken in parts of Oregon, Washington and Idaho from Friday through the weekend.

{"id": "2024_06_07_asia_japan-birth-rate-population-dating-app-intl-hnk", "text": "Japan\u2019s fertility rate, which has seen a precipitous fall for many years, has reached another record low as the government ramps up efforts to encourage young people to get married and start families\u00a0\u2014\u00a0even launching its own dating app. The nation of 123.9 million people only recorded 727,277 births last year, according to new data released by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare on Friday. The fertility rate \u2013 defined as the total number of births a woman has in her lifetime \u2013 dropped from 1.26 to 1.20. For a population to remain stable, it needs a fertility rate of 2.1. Anything above that will see a population expand, with a large proportion of children and young adults, as seen in India and many African nations. But in Japan, the fertility rate has been well below that stable marker of 2.1 for half a century, experts say \u2013 it fell below that level after the 1973 global oil crisis pushed economies into recession, and never recovered. The downward trend has accelerated in recent years, with the number of deaths overtaking births each year and causing the total population to shrink \u2013 with far-reaching consequences for Japan\u2019s workforce, economy, welfare system and social fabric. In 2023, the country recorded 1.57 million deaths, according to the Health Ministry \u2013 more than double the number of births. And Japan\u2019s not having much matrimonial luck, either \u2013 the number of marriages fell by 30,000 last year, while the number of divorces rose. Experts say the decline is expected to continue for at least several decades\u00a0and is to some extent irreversible due to the country\u2019s population structure. Even if Japan were to boost its fertility rate tomorrow, its population will keep falling until the skewed ratio of young people to older adults balances out. Still, the government is now racing to soften the impact, launching new government agencies to focus specifically on this problem. It has launched initiatives such as expanding child care facilities, offering housing subsidies to parents, and in some towns, even paying couples to have children. In the capital Tokyo, local officials are trying a new tack: launching a government-run dating app, which is in early testing phases and will be fully operational later this year. \u201cPlease use it as \u2018the first step\u2019 to begin marriage hunting,\u201d the app\u2019s website says, adding that the AI-matchmaking system is provided by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government. Users are asked to take a \u201cvalues diagnostic test\u201d but there\u2019s also an option to put in the desired traits of a future partner. \u201cBased on your values and the values you seek in a partner, which can be determined by taking a diagnostic test, AI will introduce you to a compatible person,\u201d it said. \u201cWhat cannot be measured by appearance or conditions alone may lead to unexpected encounters.\u201d The app even caught the eye of billionaire Elon Musk, who wrote on X, formerly Twitter: \u201cI\u2019m glad the government of Japan recognizes the importance of this matter. If radical action isn\u2019t taken, Japan (and many other countries) will disappear!\u201d Experts have told CNN this scenario is unlikely \u2013 the fertility rate is expected to even out at some point, and the country will adjust. Japan may look very different at that point, from its demographic makeup to its economy and domestic policies, but it won\u2019t simply vanish. \u201cMarriage is a decision based on one\u2019s own values, but the Tokyo Metropolitan Government is working to build momentum for marriage so that those who think they \u2018intend to get married eventually\u2019 can take that first step,\u201d says the dating app\u2019s website. Users must be single, over 18 years old \u201cwith a desire to get married,\u201d and be living or working in Tokyo, the website says. It also lists the government\u2019s other measures to support couples \u2013 such as providing information on work-life balance, child care and housing support, men\u2019s participation in housework and child-rearing, and career counseling. \u201cWe hope that every single one of you who wishes to get married will think about what being in a \u2018couple\u2019 means to you,\u201d it says.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/asia/japan-birth-rate-population-dating-app-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_06_africa_sudanese-government-accuses-militia-massacre-intl", "text": "At least 150 people were killed and 200 injured in an attack by rebel forces in Sudan, local officials and witnesses said, in the latest atrocity in the year-long war that has displaced more than 7 million people. Eyewitnesses told CNN Thursday how fighters from Sudan\u2019s paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) descended upon Wad al-Nour village in the central Al-Jazira state on Wednesday. They described scenes of terror and carnage as over 40 armed vehicles stormed the village, unleashing heavy weaponry on its inhabitants, killing and wounding mostly civilians, among them children and women. Fighting is still ongoing just a few kilometers away, with terrified villagers fearful of further escalations, the witness said. Another eyewitness reported the ongoing grim task of counting the dead and injured. \u201cSo far, we\u2019ve buried more than 120 people in a mass grave in the middle of the village,\u201d he said. CNN cannot independently verify the exact number of casualties. Footage shared on social media Wednesday, and geolocated by CNN, shows a large crowd in Wad Al-Noura village surrounding dozens of dead bodies, shrouded in white, as preparations were being made for their burial. Another video allegedly shows the RSF militia firing heavy and medium weapons towards the village. Both the Sudanese army and the RSF have faced damning accusations of civilian massacres since the civil war broke out in April 2023. The RSF acknowledged the attack in a statement Wednesday and said it was a pre-emptive attack on\u00a0Sudan\u2019s Armed Forces (SAF),\u00a0camps in Wad Al-Noura in response to a planned attack by the army.\u00a0They did not acknowledge the civilian deaths reported. According to the RSF, eight of its fighters were killed, others injured, and they seized vehicles, weapons, and military equipment during the operation. However, eyewitnesses told CNN that there is no military presence in the village, adding that the Sudanese army operates a military base about 30 km (19 miles) southwest of Wad Al-Noura, which is being cited as a possible reason for the attack. CNN has contacted both RSF and the Sudanese Army for comment. The leader of the SAF vowed to retaliate after arriving in a city near the attack where he visited survivors, according to state news agency SUNA. \u201cThe response to the militia\u2019s crimes against the martyrs of [Wad al-Nour] will be severe and harsh,\u201d warned Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, SAF Commander-in-Chief and President of the Sudanese Transitional Sovereignty Council. A strategic target Wad al-Nour village lies about 160 kilometers south of Sudanese capital Khartoum and is now the latest epicenter of violence in a country ravaged by internal conflict. The village has long been a strategic target for the RSF, given its close location to Al-Manaqil, where the Sudanese army maintains its only presence in Al-Jazira state. This was not the first attempt by the RSF to control Wad al-Noura, as they have tried several times to take the village. Thousands have perished since fighting erupted between forces loyal to two rival generals \u2013 army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, leader of the SAF, and General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, head of the RSF. Since the conflict started, both the Sudanese army and the RSF have faced damning accusations of civilian massacres. The RSF has specifically targeted villages in Al-Jazira, Sudan\u2019s agricultural heartland, to swell its ranks through forced conscription and using hunger as a weapon, eyewitnesses have said. In March, eyewitnesses told CNN\u00a0that more than 700 people, including dozens of children, were forcibly recruited from the state by the militia group after being ordered to \u201cenlist or die.\u201d The RSF denied this claim. International outcry and humanitarian crisis The Sudanese Transitional Sovereignty Council condemned the RSF\u2019s actions, describing them as part of a systematic campaign of violence against civilians. \u201cThis heinous crime is added to the series of crimes committed by this rebel militia in many states of Sudan. These are criminal acts that reflect the systematic behavior of these militias in targeting civilians, plundering their property, and forcibly displacing them from their areas,\u201d the Council stated. A UN representative on Thursday expressed deep concern over the reported violence and called for a thorough investigation and accountability for those responsible. \u201cEven by the tragic standards of Sudan\u2019s conflict, the images emerging from Wad Al-Noura are heart-breaking. Wars have rules that need to be respected, no matter what,\u201d UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Sudan Clementine Nkweta-Salami said. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) has warned that \u201cthe number of people displaced by conflict inside Sudan could top 10 million in the coming days.\u201d \u201cThe world\u2019s worst internal displacement crisis continues to escalate, with looming famine and disease adding to the havoc wrought by conflict,\u201d IOM said in a statement on Thursday. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs noted that over 8.8 million people have fled their homes, and 24.8 million urgently need assistance. Last week at the UN Security Council, Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide Alice Wairimu Nderitu warned, \u201cThe situation today bears all the marks of risk of genocide, with strong allegations that this crime has already been committed.\u201d CNN\u2019s Avery Schmitz contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/africa/sudanese-government-accuses-militia-massacre-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_06_middleeast_israel-airstrike-un-school-gaza-intl-hnk", "text": "Dozens of people were killed by an overnight Israeli airstrike on\u00a0a United Nations-run school in central Gaza, authorities said, in an attack that CNN analysis found was conducted with a US-made weapon. The school, run by the UN agency for Palestinian refugees\u00a0(UNRWA), was housing displaced people in the Nuseirat refugee camp at the time of the incident, the Gaza government media office said. At least 40 people were killed in the strike, according to medical workers at the nearby Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital. Authorities at the hospital said casualties could rise as victims were still being brought to the hospital on Thursday morning. The Israeli military confirmed it carried out the airstrike, which it said targeted a Hamas compound operating inside the school. Israeli military spokesperson Lt. Col. Peter Lerner later told journalists the military was not \u201caware of any civilian casualties.\u201d Lerner said \u201c20 to 30 Hamas and Islamic Jihad\u201d militants were targeted in the strike, and that those targeted were \u201cusing the facilities to plan and execute attacks\u201d against Israeli forces. Militants who were involved in the October 7 attacks on Israel were among those killed, Lerner said. Later on Thursday, the Israeli military said it had so far identified nine alleged Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters targeted in\u00a0the strike. CNN cannot independently verify any of those claims or the identities of the nine people the IDF said it identified. A CNN analysis of video from the scene and a review by an explosive weapons expert\u00a0found that US-made munitions were used in the strike on the school. CNN identified fragments of at least two US-made GBU-39 small diameter bombs (SDB) in video filmed at the scene by a journalist working for CNN. \u201cYou can determine that GBU-39s were used in Nuseirat because just as seen at the Rafah strike, you have the tail actuator section with the distinct bolt and fin slot,\u201d Trevor Ball, a former US Army explosive ordnance disposal technician told CNN Thursday. It marks the second time in two weeks that CNN has been able to verify the use of US-manufactured munitions in deadly Israeli attacks on displaced Palestinians, the first being a deadly IDF strike on\u00a0a displacement camp in Rafah on May 26. Asked whether American weapons were used in the strike, US State Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller said Thursday that was a question for the Israeli government. Miller said the US has been in contact with Israel over the strike and that Israel has only told the US \u201cessentially what they have said publicly.\u201d He added that the Israeli government would release more information, which the US expects to be \u201cfully transparent.\u201d Thursday\u2019s attack came after the IDF ramped up ground and air assaults in the center of the strip on Tuesday amid a deepening humanitarian crisis there. Palestinians in central Gaza have reported that the intensity and frequency of Israeli strikes in the last week have felt like the beginning of the war. According to a journalist in the area working with CNN, the school was hit by at least three missiles that penetrated the three-story building. The facility was believed to be housing thousands of displaced people who had taken shelter in the school, its yard, and the surrounding area,\u00a0according to the journalist. UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini said the school was sheltering about 6,000 displaced people. \u201cWe were asleep here, (and) we suddenly saw rockets falling. I went down holding my child, we were both injured, my relative was martyred in that room,\u201d journalist J\ufeffaber Abu Daher told CNN on Thursday. He said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \u201cis killing the civilians, he is not killing militants, it\u2019s innocent people asleep in a UNRWA facility\u2026 what did children and\u00a0elderly do? What did they do to him? He is looking for Hamas people? Go look for them, why are you killing us in schools?\u201d The Israeli military defended the bombing of the school, saying it had so far identified nine alleged militants it had targeted in the pre-dawn strike, its spokesperson Daniel Hagari said Thursday. He said the IDF believes there were \u201cabout 30\u201d militants hiding inside the UN school but did not provide further evidence or information as to how the IDF has come to this conclusion. Hagari added that Israeli forces, using aerial surveillance over several days, had delayed the strike on the school twice because they had identified civilians in the area. \u201cWe conducted the strike once our intelligence and surveillance indicated there were no women or children inside the Hamas compound inside those classrooms,\u201d Hagari said. He also accused Hamas of violating international law by allegedly using the UN school as an operational base. The US State Department said Israel\u2019s strike did not cross US President Joe Biden\u2019s so-called \u201cred line\u201d because that line referred to a \u201clarge-scale operation in Rafah,\u201d which the US has not yet seen. \u201cThat said, we have seen strikes that put civilians in danger well before the president said that, and we have made clear to the government of Israel that we expect them to do everything that they can to minimize civilian harm,\u201d Miller said. The UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned the strike, saying \u201cUN premises are inviolable, including during armed conflict and must be protected by all parties at all times,\u201d according to his spokesperson St\u00e9phane Dujarric. US-made weapon used Gaza authorities said the dead and injured continue to be brought to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, which is operating at three times its clinical capacity, \u201csignaling a real disaster that will lead to a greater increase in the number of martyrs,\u201d the Gaza media office said. UNRWA said its school was \u201cpossibly hit several times\u201d overnight by the strikes. An UNRWA spokesperson told CNN it was not able to confirm Israeli reports that Hamas operatives had been using the school as a compound. \u201cWe remind all parties to the conflict that schools and other UN premises must never be used for military or fighting purposes,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cUN facilities must be protected at all times.\u201d Lazzarini said in a post on X that while \u201cclaims that armed groups may have been inside the shelter are shocking\u201d they have been unable to verify it. \u201cAttacking, targeting or using UN buildings for military purposes are a blatant disregard of International Humanitarian law,\u201d he added. \ufeffMunitions made in the US were also used in the\u00a0deadly Israeli strike\u00a0on\u00a0a displacement camp in Rafah late last month, a CNN analysis of video from the scene and a review by explosive weapons experts found. After that attack, US President Joe Biden refused calls to alter his policy towards Israel, suggesting the deadly Rafah strike had not yet crossed a red line that would force changes in American support. He had previously said in a CNN interview that he wouldn\u2019t allow certain US weapons to be\u00a0used in a major offensive in Rafah. In April, CNN reported that the Biden administration authorized the transfer to Israel of over 1,000 small-diameter bombs, according to three people familiar with the matter. \u2018The situation is apocalyptic\u2019 An Israeli strike hit the same camp last month and killed dozens of people, Al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital said at the time. One woman, Um Mohammad Taha, told CNN then that five houses had collapsed, including her sister\u2019s, and that many were buried under the rubble, including children. And another Israeli attack on the Nuseirat camp in April injured several journalists, including one working with CNN. Doctors Without Borders/M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF), which has supported Al-Aqsa hospital, said Wednesday it had taken in more than 70 people who had been killed, and more than 300 injured, in just 48 hours, amid an escalation in bombing and ground fighting. Karin Huster, an MSF nurse, said in the group\u2019s statement: \u201cWe have seen hospitals being bombed. We have seen refugee camps being bombed. We have seen humanitarian warehouses being bombed. The situation is apocalyptic.\u201d \u201cThe odor of blood when I entered the emergency room was just overwhelming. People are lying on the floor. People are lying outside,\u201d Huster added. \u201cIt\u2019s just an emotionally overwhelming situation.\u201d Israel\u2019s renewed focus on bombarding central Gaza highlights again the elusive nature of its stated ambition to destroy Hamas. The brunt of the Israeli military campaign had, in recent months, moved south towards Rafah, but rocket fire and ground warfare have now again engulfed encampments further north such as Nuseirat and areas like Bureij, both just south of Gaza City. \u201cEvery place we went to after they said it\u2019s safe was struck \u2013 I want the war to stop,\u201d Mohammad Farajallah, a child who said his two brothers were killed in Thursday\u2019s strike, told CNN as he rifled through the rubble of the school. The latest attack also came as American, Egyptian and Qatari officials\u00a0met in Doha to revive negotiations on a new ceasefire and hostage release deal. The meetings follow a\u00a0three-phase proposal\u00a0\u2014 characterized as an Israeli plan \u2014 laid out by US President Joe Biden that would pair a release of hostages with a \u201cfull and complete ceasefire\u201d in Gaza. On Wednesday, Israel\u2019s Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant said the country\u2019s military offensive in Gaza would not be halted for any resumption of ceasefire and hostage release talks with Hamas. \u201cWe are in a process of continuous engagement to wear down the enemy. Any negotiations with the terrorist organization Hamas will only be conducted under fire,\u201d Gallant said in a recorded video statement. This story has been updated to\u00a0revise\u00a0the number of fatalities in the UNRWA school strike. This breaking news story will be updated.

{"id": "2024_06_02_europe_d-day-80th-anniversary-commemoration-preview-intl", "text": "At 99 years old, Jack Foy is considered the youngster among his group of friends that fought in World War II. But their advanced age isn\u2019t going to stop them from making the transatlantic journey to honor their fallen comrades on the 80th anniversary of D-Day. On June 6, Foy \u2013 a survivor of the Battle of the Bulge \u2013 and his fellow American veterans will join dignitaries and heads of state from around the world to commemorate the approximately 160,000 Allied troops who, eight decades ago, carried out the largest seaborne invasion in human history. Foy told CNN that he has been to several memorials in France since 2014. The emotional resonance of each trip grows stronger year after year, he said, because these veterans know each trip could be their last. \u201cWe realize we\u2019re getting to the end of our time,\u201d Foy said. They are not alone. With major commemorations held every five years, organizers and government officials concede that this year\u2019s event could be the last to involve living veterans, whose stories of the horrors of war have become particularly poignant given that Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has brought a large-scale ground war back to Europe for the first time since 1945. \u201cWe are perfectly aware that for these centenarians, this is maybe the last chance to return to the beaches where they landed, where they fought and where their brothers-in-arms fell,\u201d said Gen. Michel Delion, the CEO of the French government agency in charge of the French commemoration efforts, Mission Liberation. The various countries putting together the event are now planning what is expected to be the most extensive D-Day commemoration in history \u2013 both in terms of size and, crucially for elderly veterans, logistics. Approximately 150 American veterans are expected to travel to Normandy \u2013 about two dozen of whom actually fought on D-Day \u2013 said Charles Djou, the secretary of the American Battle Monuments Commission (ABMC), the independent agency responsible for managing US military cemeteries and monuments overseas. The youngest is 96. Fifteen Canadian veterans, including three or four that fought on D-Day, are traveling with the Canadian delegation, according to John Desrosiers, the director of international operations for Veterans Affairs Canada. Desrosiers said the youngest traveling with the group is 98 and the eldest are 104. The British defense ministry said it expects more than 40 WWII veterans at the various events in Normandy. Those vets will be joined by about 25 heads of state and government, including US President Joe Biden, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Russian President Vladimir Putin was not extended an invitation due to the war in Ukraine, while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is planning on attending, according to a French presidential source. With so many heads of state in town, the security measures in place are intense. A massive contingent of 12,000 security personnel will be deployed on June 6, the French Interior Ministry said. Heavy travel restrictions put in place by French authorities will also effectively cut off the Norman coastline and the normally sleepy towns that dot it from the rest of the country. Yet June 6 typically sees these elderly men criss-cross the region to hit a full day\u2019s itinerary, including national ceremonies held at the American, British and Canadian cemeteries; the big international commemoration put on by France; and then, if they have the energy, more local events. Most veterans also travel with an entire phalanx of medical personnel. The charity that organized Foy\u2019s trip, the US-based Best Defense Foundation, is bringing three doctors and 10 nurses to accompany the 50 veterans they are flying over from the United States. Each veteran will travel with a personal caregiver \u2013 typically a family member or a friend. Officials say they are going to incredible lengths to treat veterans like royalty \u2013 as they are feted by actual royals. King Charles III will be there on June 6 \u2013 his first overseas trip since being diagnosed with cancer \u2013 alongside Queen Camilla and Prince William, Buckingham Palace said. Representatives from the royal families of Belgium, Monaco, the Netherlands and Norway are also expected to attend. Delion\u2019s team has been holding rehearsals and timing wheelchair runs for the French-led international ceremony. They are also considering having veterans enter at the same time as heads of states and other dignitaries to reduce their waiting time. American and Canadian organizers told CNN that they will seat veterans last at their respective national ceremonies to keep them comfortable. The general public at the American event, for example, may need to be seated about an hour in advance due to security precautions. \u201cWe take care of the veterans who served and made the enormous sacrifices that they did in the Second World War,\u201d said Djou. Keeping the stories alive After being postponed 24 hours due to bad weather, D-Day began shortly after midnight on June 6, 1944, when paratroopers dropped into German-occupied France to lay the groundwork for the incoming invasion. Allied planes and warships began their bombardment at about 6:30 a.m., with troops hitting the beaches shortly after. They landed on a stretch of coastline 50 miles long organized into five beaches codenamed Gold, Juno, Omaha, Sword and Utah. The Americans were responsible for Omaha and Utah. The British led the assault on Gold and Sword, while the Canadians handled Juno. Though 4,414 Allied troops died that day and it would take more than a month to achieve one of D-Day\u2019s main objectives \u2013 liberating the strategically important city of Caen \u2013 the landings were considered a success. Allied troops had successfully made it onshore in France; it was the beginning of the end for Hitler and Nazi Germany. The sheer drama of the event has, for decades, captured the American public imagination, because of both the magnitude of the invasion and the fact that it was a \u201cdigestible\u201d turning point in the war, according to Ben Brands, a military historian at the ABMC. \u201cWorld War II, especially in Europe, becomes this ongoing battle from basically the moment troops land on the beaches of D-Day until Germany ultimately surrenders. The human mind needs to cut that up into digestible stories, and D-Day is a really powerful, discrete event that is so critical for everything that comes after,\u201d Brands said. \u201cThere\u2019s just so many powerful stories that come out of D-Day.\u201d As time has passed, veterans have played a crucial role in passing down the stories of D-Day. Their gripping, visceral first-hand accounts are better teachers of history than any textbook. But just a fraction of the soldiers who lived through D-Day are still alive. Of the 16.4 million Americans who served in the military during WWII, fewer than 100,000 are expected to still be alive by the end of the year, according to statistics from the US Department of Veterans Affairs. In Canada, there were just 9,297 living Canadian veterans who had served in either WWII or the Korean War as of March 31, 2023, according to the most recent statistics available from Veterans Affairs Canada. The British defense ministry said it does not keep veteran numbers on hand. It\u2019s unclear what the average age of a WWII veteran is. Given that the median age for an American WWII veteran in June 2020 was 93, according to US Census figures at the time, most surviving vets from Allied forces are likely to now be at least in their late-nineties. By the 85th anniversary in 2029, those who are still living will almost certainly be in triple digits. \u201cPeople are realizing this generation is passing and they\u2019re passing rapidly now, and it\u2019s important to keep their stories alive, to keep the memories of those who died and are buried at Normandy, but also those who fought and survived because they can no longer be with us for that much longer to tell these stories,\u201d Brands said. \u201cThe 80th will be a very powerful event.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/02/europe/d-day-80th-anniversary-commemoration-preview-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "world_africa_bananas-artificial-hair-cheverux-organique-spc", "text": "During a visit to a local farm while working with development agency USAID, Ugandan entrepreneur Juliet Tumusiime realized that a huge amount of banana stems are left over from banana cultivation and simply discarded. Looking for a way to use the waste, she struck upon an innovative business idea. Almost a decade later, now aged 42, Tumusiime is the chief executive and co-founder of Cheveux Organique, which manufactures hair made from banana fibers as an alternative to synthetic extensions. Fashion trends among the younger population and growing purchasing power have boosted the market for hair extensions and wigs in the Africa and the Middle East, which could be worth $710 million by 2028, according to Research and Markets. Extensions are typically made from human hair, or synthetic materials such as nylon, polyester, acrylic and PVC. Synthetics are popular in Uganda because they\u2019re much cheaper, but they\u2019re not biodegradable or easy to recycle. Some people complain that synthetic hair can irritate their scalp and a study of synthetic hair in Nigeria found the presence of potentially harmful heavy metals and chemicals. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to friends, colleagues, both men and women and asked them how they dispose of their hair when they take it out,\u201d Tumusiime says. \u201cA lot of the time it is just thrown in the trash. The level of awareness is really low - most people don\u2019t realize that they are wearing plastic on their head which can irritate the skin and cause pollution. \u201cOur mission is to transform the beauty industry by providing alternatives that benefit their health and the environment. We want to empower women to make informed decisions about what hair they use and what\u2019s best for them.\u201d Tumusiime says that, unlike synthetic hair, her product is biodegradable, durable and can be easily styled, treated and colored. It can also be rewashed with warm water and conditioned with detangling cream. When dry, the hypoallergenic hair can be oiled and can withstand dryers and heat up to 400 degrees, lasting weeks longer than synthetic alternatives, according to Tumusiime. Since it\u2019s made from discarded banana stems, she adds, it\u2019s also a way to help curb that waste. Uganda is Africa\u2019s largest producer and consumer of bananas, producing about 10 million metric tons of bananas per day. Ugandans consume almost one kilogram of the fruit per person, per day, with more than 75% of the population relying on bananas as a staple food, according to the World Economic Forum. Cheveux Organique works closely with local banana farmers, buying stems that would otherwise be discarded. The stems are split and the fibers extracted by machine. The extracted fibers are then dried and treated, before being combed out, resulting in the hair-like texture. The \u201chair\u201d is dyed into three shades: Cheveux Black, Cheveux Brown and Cheveux Blonde. Tumusiime says it has a natural sheen, is soft to the touch and can be used for braiding and styling. It\u2019s also suitable for warm and humid climates, she notes. The company isn\u2019t unique in creating plant-based hair. In the US, St.Louis-based Rebundle also sells hair extensions made from banana fibers, while Nourie Hair offers a hair alternative for braiding made from Ginseng root extract and rosemary. However, turning banana waste into a premium product does not come without challenges for Cheveux Organique. \u201cThe labor-intensive process, from picking the stems, transporting them to the facility, extracting the stems, treating them and the power needed to use this \u2013 it causes the product to become pricey,\u201d Tumusiime says. Cheveux Organique sells its plant-based hair in Uganda, and as fair afield as the US, France and the UK. It retails for $50 for 150 grams (5.3 ounces), which Tumusiime says is cheaper than a typical $185 for a similar amount of human hair. But synthetic hair can be bought for as little as $1 for a bundle. \u201cThis is something that we are hugely concerned about, and we are trying to find ways to mechanize the business and produce volumes of hair whilst continuing to break even,\u201d Tumusiime says. \u201cThe people paying these prices are getting a premium product at the end of it \u2013 and it\u2019s about the long-term benefits that this product brings.\u201d Tumusiime says her startup, which currently employs 25 permanent staff members and 100 part-time workers for waste gathering, is in the process of creating regional hubs, which will function as extraction centers, as well as an education point for young people. The hubs will train future generations on the positive impacts of waste management, as well as giving young people skillsets \u2013 such as extraction and machine operation \u2013 that will equip them for future careers. \u201cWe want to make sure that this brand is a household name,\u201d Tumusiime says. \u201cWe want to become leaders in this industry despite challenges. But I\u2019m passionate about what I\u2019m doing. I\u2019m not about to give up. I do everything possible to make sure that I achieve my objectives and achieve the vision for which I started this organization.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/world/africa/bananas-artificial-hair-cheverux-organique-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "travel_brazil-bus-stop-chance-encounters", "text": "Tristano always loves telling the tale of how he met his wife Alessandra \u2013 it\u2019s an amazing, continent-spanning love story. For Tristano, this story will also forever be interlinked with another amazing, continent-spanning story \u2013 one of friendship. So whenever Tristano recounts his love story, he begins several years before he first crossed paths with his wife \u2013 in 2012, to be precise. That was the year Italian-born Tristano studied abroad in Sydney, Australia and spent a few days on vacation in Fiji. Tristano loved the Pacific island nation \u2013 the spectacular beaches, the blue waters, the palm trees. Plus, he made a friend: a guy called Gustavo, from Brazil, who was also staying in Tristano\u2019s hostel. The two crossed paths on Tristano\u2019s first night, and immediately clicked. \u201cWe got along very well,\u201d Tristano tells CNN Travel today. Gustavo, it seemed, had \u201cbeen literally everywhere.\u201d And his thirst for adventure was infectious. Tristano sat with Gustavo in the hostel bar for hours, talking about their respective travels. Tristano was impressed and inspired \u2013 and felt he\u2019d found a kindred spirit. \u201cHe was a person that really motivated me to travel more and more,\u201d says Tristano. Post-Fiji, the two friends stayed in touch \u2013 tracking one another\u2019s adventures on social media, and regularly catching up over messaging app WhatsApp. \u201cOver the following years, I traveled to many places where Gustavo had lived or been, so he always gave me tips \u2013 what to do, what not to do, where to stay, which hostels to go to\u2026\u201d recalls Tristano. Cut to 2016. Tristano had three weeks of vacation to use before the year was up. He was considering going somewhere in South America. In one of his regular text exchanges with Gustavo, Tristano mentioned his potential plans. In response, Gustavo said he was actually back in his home country of Brazil \u2013 and planned to be based in Sao Paulo for the next few months. \u201cAnd then it just hit me,\u201d says Tristano. \u201cI thought, \u2018I\u2019ll go to Brazil. It\u2019s a no-brainer, because if I find good flights, I have one person there I know and I can meet up with him again.\u2019 \u201cSo I literally booked flights within half an hour of talking to him. And that was the reason I went \u2013 and how I ended up meeting Alessandra\u2026\u201d A bus stop meeting Tristano started his Brazil adventure in Rio de Janeiro. On his second day there, he decided to walk from his hostel in Panama Beach to Rio\u2019s Copacabana neighborhood. Tristano didn\u2019t get far before he realized this walk was more of a trek than he\u2019d anticipated. He checked Google Maps on his phone, and realized he could hop on a bus that\u2019d take half the time. Following his phone directions, Tristano headed to the bus stop. And once he was at what he thought was the right stop, he glanced around at the other people waiting. There were a couple of other tourists, also peering at their phones. And then there was a young woman dressed in what Tristano thought was  \u201cbusiness casual.\u201d She looked like she was en route to work. When Tristano met her eyes, the woman smiled. She seemed friendly and confident. So Tristano approached her and politely asked \u2013 in subpar, apologetic Portuguese \u2013 if he was waiting at the right place for the bus to Copacabana. In English, the woman replied. \u201cYes, you\u2019re in the right place,\u201d she said. Then she smiled again. When she smiled, her whole face lit up, and Tristano couldn\u2019t help but smile back. \u201cShe seemed like a very bright person, always smiling,\u201d he recalls today. The woman at the bus stop introduced herself as Alessandra. As Tristano had guessed, she was en route to work that morning. \u201cI actually never usually went to that bus stop,\u201d Alessandra tells CNN Travel today. (Alessandra and Tristano have requested their last names not be included in this article for privacy reasons.) The day she met Tristano, Alessandra had taken a slightly different route that morning as she\u2019d had to pick something up at the store before work. Before Tristano approached her, Alessndra hadn\u2019t noticed him \u2013 she\u2019d been in commuter mode, focused on the journey at hand. But when Tristano starting speaking to to her in his awkward Portuguese, Alessandra found him charming. And then they talked a little as they waited for the bus \u2013 Tristano told Alessandra he was on vacation for three weeks, she asked him how he was finding Rio so far, explaining she\u2019d lived there since she was a kid. The conversation flowed easily \u2013 so much so that when the bus pulled up, Tristano and Alessandra got on together and, in silent agreement, decided to sit next to each other and continue talking. \u201cWe sat together for probably 15, 20 minutes on the bus ride, just chatting casually,\u201d recalls Tristano. It was a brief journey, but just before the bus pulled up at Tristano\u2019s stop, Tristano turned to Alessandra and asked for her number. He suggested to Alessandra it\u2019d be nice to get to know a Rio local, \u201csomebody who can give me good tips.\u201d \u201cI was going to travel to the other areas of Brazil for the next two weeks, but I knew I was coming back to Rio,\u201d he explains. Alessandra was wary of handing out her phone number to a guy she didn\u2019t really know. But she thought Tristano seemed sweet \u2013 and in all honesty, she assumed she\u2019d never hear from him again. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect anything, especially because he was traveling around Brazil,\u201d she says. But Tristano texted Alessandra right away. And over the next couple of weeks, as Tristano visited Gustavo in Sao Paulo and explored the rest of the country, he and Alessandra contnued to message back and forth. A first date in Rio Once Tristano was back in Rio, he contacted Alessandra to ask if she would like to meet for dinner. Alessandra agreed, but then at the last minute canceled \u2013 explaining she had a headache. Tristano wondered if this was an excuse, whether Alessandra wasn\u2019t actually that interested. Still, he suggested they rearrange for the following night. \u201cThhen we actually went out to dinner,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd then the rest is history.\u201d Alessandra actually did have a headache the night before \u2013 a throbbing migraine. She was happy the date got rearranged, and looking forward to seeing Tristano again. But she went into the evening with no expectations. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect to feel something romantic, just an opportunity to get to know him,\u201d she recalls. \u201cBut then, well, once we sat at the table, I saw his green eyes shining. And I felt something sparking after that.\u201d Alessandra found Tristano to be a supportive, encouraging listener. They seamlessly segued between fun, lighthearted conversations and more in-depth discussions. \u201cThe talk was very interesting,\u201d Alessandra recalls. \u201cHe was very interested in my life in Rio, and how hard, let\u2019s say, my life was compared to his.\u201d As for Tristano, he loved getting a glimpse into Alessandra\u2019s world and her mind \u2013 and learning more about her and her childhood growing up in Rio. \u201cWe agreed to meet the very next day,\u201d he recalls. \u201cIt was a weekend. And we spent the whole day walking around the lagoon in Rio, eating ice cream, chatting and laughing and just having a very nice time.\u201d In the evening, Alessandra and Tristano went out for drinks, and then to a club together. \u201cThat\u2019s when we kissed for the first time,\u201d Tristano recalls. Tristano and Alessandra were growing closer. But the next day was Tristano\u2019s last in Rio. The two spent all day together, right up until Tristano had to leave. \u201cWhat left a mark on me was the moment we said goodbye,\u201d says Tristano. \u201cAt the metro station, she started crying.\u201d As Tristano consoled Alessandra, hugged her and wiping away her tears, he also felt emotional. Having to leave felt like \u201ca big sadness,\u201d as he puts it. The feeling weighed on him. \u201cAnd it was also a big surprise, you\u2019re like, \u2018How can I feel this after meeting somebody for literally 48 hours?\u2019 So it felt very strong \u2013 and also very uncertain.\u201d Tristano and Alessandra wanted to see each other again, but both said goodbye thinking it might never happen. As he left, Tristano thanked Alessandra for their time together \u2013 something she took to mean things between them had ended before they\u2019d even began. But although Tristano returned to the UK \u2013 where he was living at the time \u2013 he and Alessandra remained in constant contact. They texted good morning and good night. They sent each other photos of what they were up to each day. Before loing, they both admitted they were desperate to see one another again. \u201cAnd so only three months later, we decided to travel to Colombia together,\u201d says Tristano. This trip sealed the deal, and it was \u201cthe real start of the relationship,\u201d says Tristano. \u201cSo we kept meeting,\u201d he says. \u201cVisiting different places every three, four months.\u201d \u201cIt was sad, anytime we had to say goodbye,\u201d recalls Alessandra. But they mostly tried to focus on \u201cjust enjoying the time together,\u201d she says. After all, it was still unclear what the future held \u2013 and whether Alessandra and Tristano could build a future across continents. \u201cI always thought, you know, this obviously cannot go on forever. At some point, we\u2019re going to have to decide what we do,\u201d recalls Tristano. \u201cAnd I wasn\u2019t sure either way, because I knew that not being together wasn\u2019t I wasn\u2019t going to be happy, she wasn\u2019t going to be happy\u2026\u201d But the alternative \u2013 one of them moving across the globe to be with the other \u2013 seemed like a big step and a tough decision. A big step After a year of meeting in destinations across the globe, Alessandra came to Italy for the first time, and met Tristano\u2019s family. A few months later, Tristano met Alessandra\u2019s loved ones in Brazil. Things between them seemed to have naturally moved towards something more serious, more concrete. Around this time, in early 2018, Tristano\u2019s job took him from the UK to Munich, Germany. As he prepared to move, Tristano asked Alessandra if she\u2019d like to move to Germany with him. Alessandra spent an emotional week debating her response. She felt like her life had turned \u201cupside down\u201d and she jumped back and forth between certainty about her love for Tristano, fear of the unknown and sadness at the idea of leaving Brazil. \u201cIt was such a big move, leaving my family, friends, job, sunny days and the beach,\u201d she says. \u201cI wanted to go, but I didn\u2019t want to give up on my life in Brazil and my family.\u201d \u201cBut after this week, I said, \u2018Look, I have nothing to lose, I better try and if it doesn\u2019t work then I can\u2019t regret something I didn\u2019t do.\u2019 And my mom supported me.\u201d Alessandra\u2019s mother liked Tristano \u2013 and she trusted her daughter\u2019s decision. Some of Alessandra\u2019s friends were more wary, and suggested Tristano was \u201cjust playing with her.\u201d \u201cBut I always followed my heart,\u201d says Alessandra. She believed in Tristano and their future. \u201cIt felt right to jump,\u201d she says. And so in 2018, Alessandra and Tristano moved to Munich together. \u201cI was excited for this new chapter, but also concerned with the German language, which I had zero knowledge of and the winter weather,\u201d recalls Alessandra.\u00a0 \u201cNevertheless, I was lucky enough to find a job in a multicultural agency, which uses English as the main language. And got used to enjoying the cold months with warm clothes and food.\u201d It also helped that Germany wasn\u2019t Tristano\u2019s home country either. He was also learning the language. And living in a third country allowed the couple to experience a new culture together. A proposal 2018 was also the year Tristano asked Alessandra to marry him. He prepared her a multiple course meal in their Munich apartment, presenting each course under a metal food cover dome \u2013 like servers do in fancy restaurants. When he got to what Alessandra assumed was the final course there was a surprise \u2013 it wasn\u2019t a dessert, but a ring. \u201cI was really surprised,\u201d says Alessandra. \u201cAnd then he asked me to marry him in Portuguese, which made it really special to me.\u201d Tristano and Alessandra enjoyed a small wedding ceremony in Germany. Then they started carving out a life together \u2013 settling into new jobs and looking towards the future. \u201cWe helped each other to follow our goals,\u201d says Tristano. Last year, in 2023, Alessandra and Tristano welcomed a son together, Gabriele. They\u2019re raising Gabriele to speak four languages \u2013 Italian, Portuguese, German and English. \u201cUntil Alessandra moved to Germany, we spoke English to each other,\u201d recalls Tristano. \u201cBut then we obviously decided, \u2018Okay, we cannot spend our life speaking English. It\u2019s not our native language for either of us.\u2019\u201d The couple vowed to become fluent in one another\u2019s languages \u2013 a vow they kept. \u201cSo now we basically switch between Portuguese and Italian every few months,\u201d explains Tristano. In May, Tristano and Alessandra\u2019s son Gabriele turned one. Earlier this year, Alessandra and Tristano took him to Brazil for the first time, for an extended two month trip to visit family and loved ones. \u201cWe spent many weeks of those two months in Rio. And for the last one and a half weeks we stayed, actually, in the Copacabana area,\u201d says Tristano. Staying there naturally took the couple back to their first meeting, eight years ago, at the Rio bus stop. Thinking back on how far they\u2019d come was emotional for them both. \u201cIt was crazy,\u201d says Tristano. \u201cWe were doing the same bus route with our son. I don\u2019t even know how to describe it.\u201d A life-changing series of events A few days after he met Alessandra at the Rio bus stop back in 2016, Tristano met up with his good friend Gustavo in Sao Paulo. Tristano remembers they both talked about their love lives. Tristano barely knew Alessandra then \u2013 and had no reason to assume he\u2019d ever see her again \u2013 but he still found himself effusing to Gustavo about the woman from the bus stop. \u201cWe shared stories, and I said, \u2018You know, I actually met a girl, Alessandra.\u2019 And I told him about her \u2013 just how interesting she was and so on,\u201d recalls Tristano. Tristano updated Gustavo on his romance with Alessandra as the relationship developed over the next couple of years. He always hoped the two of them would be able to meet, and he often told Gustavo he credited him with putting him on the path to meet Alessandra. In the summer of 2019, Tristano realized he hadn\u2019t heard from Gustavo for a while. He reached out on WhatsApp, but the message went unread and unanswered. \u201cI didn\u2019t think much of it,\u201d says Tristano. \u201cBut then I went on his Facebook page, and I realized that he had drowned during a swimming excursion in Hawaii.\u201d Tristano was in shock. His friend had passed away a few months prior. As they didn\u2019t have any mutual friends, the news had passed him by. Tristano sat at his laptop, reading the words over and over again. With a sinking feeling, he realized he\u2019d never see his friend again, that Alessandra and Gustavo would never meet. \u201cI always imagined that if we were going to have a wedding, with a big reception and so on, Gustavo would be the main person I would thank for meeting Alessandra \u2013 because it was thanks to him that I actually ended up going to Brazil,\u201d says Tristano. \u201cObviously, that could not happen.\u201d Tristano was heartbroken. Amid his grief, he searched Facebook for Gustavo\u2019s mother\u2019s details. He sent her a friend request. \u201cI got in touch with his mom. And I told her about the whole story, and she was very happy to hear that thanks to Gustavo\u2019s passion for traveling and his friends, he made a massive contribution to our life,\u201d says Tristano. Tristano is still in touch with Gustavo\u2019s mother. And he still credits his friend with changing his life. He sees his life story as defined by two serendipitous travel encounters: first with Gustavo, and then with Alessandra. Both stories, to Tristano, illustrate the power of travel and connections. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t traveled to Fiji and met him, I would have certainly not traveled to Brazil in 2016 either,\u201d says Tristano. \u201cAnd my son Gabriele would not be here today.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/brazil-bus-stop-chance-encounters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_03_asia_shangrila-dialogue-china-trump-intl-hnk", "text": "Any tourist wandering through the glitzy lobby of Singapore\u2019s Shangri-La Hotel this weekend would have stumbled on a rather bizarre scene. Military officers from around the world thronged the halls of the luxury hotel, their shoulders dripping with gold braids and epaulets, complicated colored bars lined up on the chests of their dress uniforms like some martial game of Tetris. Every few minutes a defense minister strode purposely through the mix, surrounded by a phalanx of aides and escorts. This gathering is an annual spectacle that to the uninitiated might seem surreal. But the topics being discussed here are deadly serious. The annual Shangri-La Dialogue is one of the few places in the world where you can watch warriors who spend their careers preparing for armed conflict, engaged in polite, carefully-moderated debate. The stakes this year could hardly be higher. War rages in both the Middle East and Europe. Meanwhile China\u2019s increasingly assertive moves has much of the Asia-Pacific on edge. The Singapore summit brought key players together. Where else would you have the President of the Philippines, a nation whichdo has seen its vessels increasingly targeted by Chinese coast guard ships in the disputed South China Sea, deliver a keynote address on the same stage that, two days later, Beijing\u2019s new Defense Minister makes his debut appearance? There was even a surprise appearance from Ukraine\u2019s embattled president Volodymyr Zelensky \u2013 and a first face-to-face meeting between US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and his Chinese counterpart Adm Dong Jun. Given its location in the city-state of Singapore, events in Asia \u2013 and in particular China\u2019s behavior in the region \u2013 stalked the conference. In his keynote speech, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. issued a stark warning about the ongoing confrontations between Philippine and China Coast Guard vessels in a contested part of the South China Sea. \u201cIf a Filipino citizen is killed by a willful act,\u201d he said, \u201cthat is I think, very, very close to what we define as an act of war.\u201d Two days later, China\u2019s Adm Dong fired back from the same stage, accusing the Philippines of \u201cblackmail\u201d in the maritime dispute. \u201cThere is a limit to our restraint,\u201d said Admiral Dong Jun. \u201cI saw that as a threat,\u201d said Dewi Fortuna Anwar, a research professor at Indonesia\u2019s National Research and Innovation Center who has been attending the Shangri-La Dialogue since its founding twenty-one years ago. \u201cIn decades past, the Chinese only came in a small number and they were extremely quiet,\u201d she said.\u00a0 \u201cNow they\u2019re very self confident\u2026they intervene in all the sessions.\u201d The open nature of the Shangri-La Dialogue provides delegates with a unique opportunity to ask blunt questions of speakers. After his speech on Sunday, China\u2019s Dong received many questions from audience members on Beijing\u2019s increased threats towards self-governing Taiwan as well as its disputed claims in the South China Sea, and he replied in unapologetic terms. The \u201cseparatists\u201d in Taiwan\u2019s newly-elected government would\u00a0be \u201cnailed to the pillar of shame in history,\u201d he said. But equally, Chinese military officers also used Q&A sessions at other key moments to make their views known. Senior Colonel Yanzhong Cao of China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army asked US Secretary of Defense asked US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin whether the US was trying to build a NATO-like alliance in the Asia-Pacific region, adding the claim \u201cthe eastward expansion of NATO has led to the Ukraine crisis.\u201d \u201cI respectfully disagree,\u201d Austin replied, the audience in the ballroom then erupting into a rare burst of applause. \u201cThe Ukraine crisis obviously was caused because Mr. Putin made a decision to unlawfully invade his neighbor,\u201d Austin continued. \u201cThis was brought on because of a decision by Mr. Putin.\u201d Later that day, Ukrainian leader Zelensky got a borderline rock star welcome when he made a surprise appearance at the conference, dressed in his trademark fatigues and black t-shirt. \u201cWe stand with you,\u201d Ng Eng Hen, Singapore\u2019s minister of defense, later said to Zelensky. But the large contingent of Chinese army officers present at other sessions was notably absent during Zelensky\u2019s speech and the Ukrainian leader said he failed to secure a one-on-one meeting with Chinese officials during his Singapore visit. He also accused Beijing of aiding Ukraine\u2019s mortal enemy. \u201cWith China\u2019s support to Russia, the war will last longer.\u00a0\u00a0That is bad for the whole world, and the policy of China \u2013 who declares that it supports territorial integrity and sovereignty and declares it officially. For them it is not good,\u201d Zelensky told journalists. It was not clear whether Zelensky succeeded in securing new support for Kyiv from non-aligned south-east Asian countries like Malaysia and Indonesia. Instead, Indonesian president-elect and retired general Prabowo Subianto \u2013 the new leader of the world\u2019s most populous Muslim majority nation \u2013 spent much of his speech calling for an end to the on-going carnage in Gaza and an investigation into recent Israeli attacks that killed dozens of displaced civilians in Rafah. Another political elephant in the room was what direction might the United States be heading in. The Singapore gathering began just hours after a 12-person jury in a court-room in New York City\u00a0convicted former US President Donald Trump on of all 34 counts of falsifying business records in his hush money criminal trial. Asia is watching very closely for whether Trump will return to office in November and what impact that might have on the world\u2019s most populous continent and a region already fraught with very real geopolitical fault lines. Republican Senator Dan Sullivan requested not to discuss Trump during a meeting with journalists, instead directing reporters to a press release. \u201cThis is a very sad day for American and the rule of law,\u201d Sullivan\u2019s statement said, calling the verdict a \u201cgross abuse of our justice system.\u201d But speaking to journalists, the Senator from Alaska also celebrated what he called America\u2019s \u201ccommitment to liberty and democracy,\u201d saying this marked a competitive advantage over \u201cauthoritarian aggression led by China, Russia, Iran and North Korea.\u201d Sullivan was part of a bi-partisan delegation seeking to demonstrate Congressional commitment to US allies in Asia. \u201cThe dictators we are allied against\u2026are ally poor,\u201d Sullivan said. But there are clearly concerns about US reliability. An academic from Japan \u2013 Washington\u2019s closest ally in Asia \u2013 asked defense chiefs from Singapore and Malaysia about Trump\u2019s possible re-election.\u00a0 He called it a \u201cnightmare\u201d scenario. That triggered nervous laughter from the audience and on stage. Singapore\u2019s Dr. Ng Eng Hen gamely responded, \u201cwe will work with any administration in any country if we can find common ground.\u201d I vividly remember collective nervousness at the 2017 Shangri-La Dialogue, held just months after Trump\u2019s inauguration. Trump\u2019s then secretary of defense James Mattis clearly sought to reassure American defense partners worried about the new mercurial president. \u201cBear with us,\u201d Mattis told the audience, after being asked whether the \u201cAmerica First\u201d commander-in-chief would contribute to the destruction of the post-World War II order. \u201cOnce we\u2019ve exhausted all possible alternatives, the Americans will do the right thing.\u00a0 We will still be there.\u201d Seven years later, uncertainty over the political future of the US is just one of many challenges facing policy makers. One by one, the leaders of armies and navies shared their fears about climate change, nuclear proliferation, wars in Europe and the Middle East and concerns that a miscalculation between the US and Chinese militaries could spiral out of control \u201cThe world cannot withstand a third geopolitical shock,\u201d Singaporean defense chief Dr. Ng warned, after invoking the Gaza and Ukraine conflicts. In this tense geopolitical environment, it\u2019s far better for commanders to put on their dress uniforms and rub shoulders in the halls of a five-star hotel, than aim at each other over gun barrels on the battlefield.

{"id": "2024_06_07_style_nicola-coughlan-bridgerton-lotw", "text": "(CNN) \u2014 \u201cBridgerton\u201d fans haven\u2019t been able to stop talking about that long-awaited carriage scene that closed out the first half of the hit Regency-era romance series\u2019 third season on Netflix. And now, as stars Nicola Coughlan and Luke Newton, who play love interests Penelope Featherington and Colin Bridgerton (Polin, to the shippers), promote the remaining episodes, Coughlan is pulling out all the sartorial stops to match the romance of the season. At the Toronto red-carpet premiere earlier this week, Coughlan stepped out in a structured lavender mini dress rippling with petal-like silk organza, paired with a voluminous red gathered cloak fit for early 19th-century yearning. The couture ensemble is by designer Sara Mrad and served as another example of Coughlan\u2019s stylist, Aim\u00e9e Croysdill, playing up the Irish actress\u2019s curves with exaggerated silhouettes. Coughlan has long been admired for her bold red-carpet looks \u2014 including her debut at the Met Gala in 2022 in an extravagant pink and black Richard Quinn ball gown \u2014 but she\u2019s amplified her style on her \u201cBridgerton\u201d press tour. In April, she glimmered at a London event in a sculptural 22-karat gold-plated corset by MISHO that featured an anatomical heart. Last month, she wore a dramatic white peplum hourglass gown by Danielle Frankel to the New York premiere. (Nearly all her looks have also been accessorized with a red pin that signals her support for a ceasefire in Palestine, too). This season has been a milestone for her character Penelope, who takes the spotlight at court, and Coughlan. As the former \u201cDerry Girls\u201d actor has stepped into the role of leading lady, she\u2019s intentional about how she wants to be portrayed. \u201cThere\u2019s one scene where I\u2019m very naked on camera, and that was my idea, my choice. It just felt like the biggest \u2018f*** you\u2019 to all the conversation surrounding my body; it was amazingly empowering,\u201d she told Stylist magazine earlier this year, which was reported on by BuzzFeed. And though Coughlan\u2019s power dressing can speak for itself, the actor has been candid with her fans about what\u2019s appropriate and what isn\u2019t, writing on Instagram earlier this year that \u201cit\u2019s really hard to take the weight of thousands of opinions on how you look being sent directly to you every day.\u201d But she\u2019s also responded with wit that rivals Penelope\u2019s. At the Dublin premiere, she was asked about her \u201cbravery\u201d in showing her body on screen. She replied: \u201cYou know it is hard because I think women with my body type \u2013\u2014 women with perfect breasts \u2014 don\u2019t get to see ourselves on screen enough.\u201d \u201cI hope you enjoy them,\u201d she added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/style/nicola-coughlan-bridgerton-lotw/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "world"}}

And heat hasn\u2019t peaked yet. July-like high temperatures will top out at 20 to 25 degrees above normal in multiple Western states this week and could break several daily record high temperatures. Thursday will be the hottest day of the week for millions of people. The temperatures will be dangerous for those exposed to the elements and unable to cool off. Relief from the heat won\u2019t be found at night, either \u2013 another symptom of a world warming due to fossil fuel pollution. The extreme heat already turned deadly over the weekend with worse to come. Excessive heat warnings are in effect for nearly 19 million people in California, Nevada, Arizona and Utah and South Texas. The warnings are the most extreme form of heat alert issued by the National Weather Service and are used when widespread, dangerous heat is expected. The soaring temperatures are being caused by a\u00a0heat dome, a large area of high pressure that parks over an area, traps air and heats it with abundant sunshine for days or weeks. The resulting heat becomes more intense the longer a heat dome lasts. SO HOT: The planet has just lived through a \u2018shocking\u2019 12-month streak of record heat. It\u2019s set to get worse The intense heat began Tuesday in parts of California and the West. Sacramento, California, hit triple digits for the first time this year while Las Vegas ended up just a degree shy of its hottest temperature of the year so far. Numerous daily records were also broken in Texas. Temperatures will soar higher on Wednesday across a larger portion of the Southwest. The most extreme heat will avoid major population centers along the coast, but Los Angeles will still be 5 to 10 degrees warmer than normal this week. TELL US: Worried about affording air conditioning this summer? Share your story Triple-digit temperatures will become widespread in California\u2019s Central Valley Wednesday and stick around into the weekend. Conditions will also sizzle in Southern California\u2019s desert regions. Death Valley, the hottest place in the world, will likely reach a high temperature of at least 120 degrees by Thursday. Even the brutal desert landscape doesn\u2019t typically get this hot until mid-to-late June. Phoenix will likely hit 110 degrees for the first time this year by Thursday, even though the city doesn\u2019t typically encounter these temperatures until mid-June. High temperatures are forecast to climb into the low 110s in Las Vegas, likely tying this year with 2010 for the earliest such reading on record in the city. Summerlike heat will also send daily high temperature records tumbling. Phoenix; Las Vegas; Flagstaff, Arizona; Reno, Nevada; and Fresno, California, are just a handful of cities where the day\u2019s high temperature record could fall on one or more days this week. By Friday, records could be broken in parts of Oregon, Washington, Idaho and Colorado as heat expands north and east. Deadly heat on the US-Mexico border Dangerous heat isn\u2019t new for the far southern US. Brutal heat in Mexico crept north into southern Texas earlier this spring and has been unrelenting for weeks. Several cities along the Texas-Mexico border experienced their hottest May on record. The triple digit temperatures at the border proved deadly last weekend after US Border Patrol agents said four migrants died \u201cfrom heat stroke and dehydration.\u201d The deaths were part of \u201cseveral emergencies\u201d involving heat-related illnesses last weekend, according to the US Border Patrol, El Paso Sector. The sector includes portions of southeastern New Mexico and western Texas. Heat is the deadliest weather threat in the US. It kills more than twice as many people each year as hurricanes and tornadoes combined, according to the National Weather Service. High temperatures in the area were about 5 degrees above normal from last Friday through Sunday, but are likely to climb to 10 degrees above normal Thursday and Friday.

There\u2019s the Art Deco curved crown of the Chrysler Building, the sweeping isosceles triangles that twist around One World Trade Center, the stepped limestone and granite rectangles of the Empire State Building and the triangular prism of the Flatiron Building. And now, a multi-billion-dollar tower featuring floor-to-ceiling glass will add another dimension to the cityscape, according to new details unveiled by New York City Mayor Eric Adams this week. Stretching up 62 stories, a planned office tower at 350 Park Avenue will provide space for more than 6,000 jobs, plus 1.8 million square feet of commercial office space, according to a press release. It will be funded by Vornado Realty Trust, Kenneth Griffin, founder and CEO of global investment firm Citadel, and building and management company Rudin. White columns will frame a new public concourse at the base of the new building on Park Avenue, complete with green space, seating and art displays, images show. Above, landscaped terraces will top each section of the glass-clad tower which will house the offices for Citadel and market making firm Citadel Securities. Adams hailed the project in the release, saying it will help \u201csupercharge our economy and expand New York City\u2019s iconic skyline,\u201d building on \u201ccontinued efforts to energize Midtown Manhattan as the world\u2019s most important business address and an economic engine for working-class New Yorkers.\u201d Architects Foster + Partners have designed the building, which will replace the existing 30-story tower currently at the site in Midtown Manhattan just a few blocks away from landmarks like the Rockefeller Center, St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral and Grand Central Station. As New York continues to deal with the economic aftershocks wrought by the Covid-19 pandemic, Adams and his administration said in their respective statements that they hoped this project would continue the city\u2019s recovery. \u201cThis investment opens a new chapter for Midtown \u2014 and closes the book on those who predicted its demise,\u201d said deputy mayor for operations Meera Joshi. \u201cMidtown\u2019s revitalization is being led by its public realm \u2014 including investments in Fifth Avenue, with the crown jewels of Central Park and Bryant Park at either end. Together, with our business improvement district and parks partners, we are reintroducing Fifth Avenue to the world and creating a vibrant live, work, play community for a new era,\u201d Joshi added. Building this new office space comes at a fraught time for the commercial real estate market as businesses struggle to entice workers back to the office after years of working from home. This has left vast tranches of office space vacant or underused, causing the value of such buildings to plummet at the same time as historically high interest rates have made it harder for real estate developers \u2014\u00a0who often take out huge loans to finance projects \u2014\u00a0to make good on their repayments. The project will begin the city\u2019s public review process early next year and the tower is expected to be completed by 2032, according to the release.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/20/style/park-avenue-skyscraper-new-york-skyline-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_06_06_middleeast_israel-hezbollah-lebanon-tensions-escalate-explainer-intl", "text": "Israel and the Lebanese Iran-backed Islamist group Hezbollah are ramping up cross-border attacks after months of low-intensity fighting, prompting the Israeli military to warn this week that it is prepared to launch a large-scale attack on its northern border. With both sides trading fire for more than eight months, experts say Israel feels it can no longer ignore its northern front or delay taking action there. A full-blown war appears to have become more likely \u2013 even if both sides have no desire for one, analysts believe. Here\u2019s what we know: Why are Israel and Hezbollah fighting? Lebanon and Israel have officially been in a state of war for decades. Israel launched a devastating invasion of Lebanon in 1982, sending tanks all the way to the capital Beirut,\u00a0after coming under attack from Palestinian militants in the country. It then occupied southern Lebanon for 22 years until it was driven out by Hezbollah in 2000. In Lebanon, Hezbollah is officially considered a \u201cresistance\u201d group tasked with confronting Israel, which Beirut classifies as an enemy state. Much of the Western world has designated Hezbollah a terrorist organization. Since then, the two sides have traded fire sporadically, but tensions boiled over in 2006 when Israel went to war in southern Lebanon after Hezbollah kidnapped two Israeli soldiers. More than 1,000 Lebanese were killed in that conflict, mostly civilians, as well as 49 Israeli civilians and 121 soldiers. Two years later, Hezbollah returned the remains of the kidnapped soldiers in exchange for the release of Lebanese and Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails, as well as the bodies of militants Israel was holding. The latest hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah started after Hamas led an attack on Israel on October 7, killing 1,200 people and abducting 250, according to Israeli authorities. That prompted Israel to go to war with Hamas in Gaza, during which it has levelled much of the territory and killed more than 36,000 Palestinians. Hezbollah has said that its current round of fighting with Israel is to support the Palestinians in Gaza. The military capability of the Lebanese group has grown since 2006, when it relied largely on inaccurate Soviet-era Katyusha rockets. Today, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah says his group boasts more than 100,000 fighters and reservists. The group is also believed to possess 150,000 rockets that could overwhelm Israel\u2019s defenses if an all-out war breaks out. Why are tensions flaring up now? The conflict between Israel and Hezbollah has been gradually intensifying since October 8, said Heiko Wimmen, project director for Iraq, Syria and Lebanon at the International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based think tank. It\u2019s a \u201cslow-motion escalation\u201d that \u201cinches upwards,\u201d he said. But both sides have come closer to war of late as clashes across the border have grown in number and scale. \u201cThere is clearly an escalation,\u201d said Wimmen, particularly in terms of deaths on each side of the border and the type of weaponry Hezbollah has been deploying. An Israeli reservist was killed in a Hezbollah strike on a village in northern Israel on Wednesday, bringing the total number of soldiers killed on the Israeli side to 19. Israel and Hezbollah have also been striking much deeper into each other\u2019s territory than they were at the beginning of the war, when fighting was confined to a roughly 4-kilometer (2.5-mile) radius of the border on either side. Hezbollah has fired 35 kilometers into Israel, while Israel has targeted areas of Lebanon more than 120 kilometers north. Cross-border attacks from Lebanon this week led to large fires blazing through Israel\u2019s northern region,\u00a0which Israel attributed to rocket fire from southern Lebanon, where Hezbollah said it had launched a \u201cswarm of drones\u201d at Israeli military sites. On Wednesday Hezbollah said it had targeted Israel\u2019s Iron Dome defense system in the northern village of Ramot Naftali, using a guided missile. Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Lt. Col. Peter Lerner told a briefing Thursday: \u201cI can\u2019t confirm that at this stage. I can\u2019t confirm that this happened at all.\u201d Amal Saad, a lecturer at Cardiff University and an expert on Hezbollah, said the group\u2019s escalation \u201cis a marked departure from prior flare-ups that have occurred since October 8.\u201d \u201cThis stage transcends merely responding to Israeli attacks and restoring deterrence; it involves conveying new messages and strategies,\u201d Saad wrote on X. The conflict has become \u201cvery visible\u201d and \u201cdifficult to ignore,\u201d said Wimmen, of the International Crisis Group, adding that Israeli officials feel compelled to respond, or at least be seen as responding, amid pressure to react from far-right ministers in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government. There is a push within government and the Israeli army to take action in the north, Ronni Shaked, a scholar at the Truman Institute at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, told CNN. \u201cNobody can live in this situation.\u201d What are both sides saying? Rhetoric has been fiery from both sides, but experts say neither side wants a full-blown conflict. Netanyahu in December warned that Beirut would turn into Gaza if Hezbollah chose to start an all-out war. But Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich this week poured cold water on the prospect of a wider war, saying the IDF isn\u2019t interested in broadening the war to eliminate Hezbollah. The military is \u201ctelling us right now that it doesn\u2019t want to\u2026 launch an attack in the north, fight and defeat Hezbollah, and overwhelm it and create a security zone.\u201d During his visit to the northern city of Kiryat Shmona near the Lebanese border on Wednesday, Netanyahu said Israel was prepared for \u201cvery intense action\u201d in the north. \u201cWhoever thinks that they can hurt us and that we will sit idly by is making a big mistake,\u201d the prime minister said. \u201cOne way or another, we will restore security to the north.\u201d Naim Qassem, Hezbollah\u2019s second-in-command, told Al Jazeera on Tuesday that the group had assessed that recent threats from Israel were not serious. \u201cEither way, we have decided not to widen the battle and we do not want an all-out war. But if it is imposed on us, we are ready and we won\u2019t retreat,\u201d Qassem said, adding that Hezbollah will end its attacks on Israel once the war in Gaza stops. Is a full-blown war likely? Experts say that while both sides may not choose to start an all-out war, their escalatory actions may still trigger one inadvertently. Wimmen of the International Crisis Group said that Israel and Hezbollah are unlikely to take a conscious decision to start a war. However, the more intense the conflict becomes, the deeper each side strikes into the other\u2019s territory and the heavier the weapons used, the more likely it is that \u201csomething goes wrong,\u201d he said. Netanyahu is under intense pressure from the opposition and members of his coalition to take action in the north, especially given that so many Israelis have been displaced from the area. More than 53,000 Israelis have been forced to leave their homes in the north, the IDF said. In Lebanon, more than 94,000 people have been displaced from areas and towns near the border with Israel since the conflict started, according to figures released Tuesday by the Lebanese Ministry of Public Health. \u201cAll Hezbollah strongholds must be burned and destroyed. War!\u201d said Israeli far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir in a statement this week. Opposition leader Yair Lapid also slammed the government, saying: \u201cThe north goes up in flames and Israeli deterrence burns with it. \u201cThe government has no plan for the day after in Gaza, no plan to return the residents to the north, no management, no strategy. A government of total abandonment,\u201d Lapid said on X. The US has cautioned against escalation, worried it might spin out of control. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Wednesday the United States is \u201cincredibly concerned\u201d about the risk of escalation, adding that the Biden administration is engaged in diplomatic conversations \u201cto try to avoid that conflict from escalating beyond control.\u201d Shaked, the Truman Institute scholar, said that despite Hezbollah\u2019s assertions that its attacks on Israel are in support of Gaza, the group\u2019s strategy is likely to be closely coordinated with its closest ally Iran \u2013 especially with so much at stake.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-lebanon-tensions-escalate-explainer-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "world"}}

Comprising of 391 units, Aston Martin Residences Miami sits at the mouth of the Miami River on Biscayne Bay, the firm said in a statement Tuesday. Designed in partnership with architect Rodolfo Miani of Bodas Mian Anger and built by G&G Business Developments, the 249-meter- (818-foot-) tall building houses seven penthouses, each with private pools and terraces, as well as apartments ranging in size from one to five bedrooms. The largest unit is the \u201cUnique Triplex Penthouse,\u201d arranged over three floors at the top of the building, which remains on the market for $59 million. The property was officially opened on Tuesday. Timed to coincide with the Formula One Miami Grand Prix, the company said in a statement that it marks \u201cthe latest distinct expression of Aston Martin\u2019s ultra-luxury high performance brand.\u201d Featuring an infinity pool with a pool deck, jacuzzis and cabanas on the 55th floor, the sail-shaped complex has a two-floor fitness center, two movie theaters and a virtual golf simulator. The building has a sky bar and lounge, chef\u2019s kitchen, ballroom and private dining areas, as well as a spa, beauty salon and barber shop. Direct access to the sea via a superyacht marina is also available, plus a private butler service. Germ\u00e1n Coto, chief executive officer of G&G Business Developments, told CNN Tuesday that the firm wanted to work on a project in the \u201ccosmopolitan city\u201d of Miami, and that this piece of land was the perfect choice. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing plot with an excellent view of the river,\u201d said Coto. The structure\u2019s aerodynamic shape helps the building deal with the technical challenges presented by high winds in the area, as well as evoking the sleek shape of an Aston Martin, according to Marek Reichman, executive vice president and chief creative officer of Aston Martin. It also becomes wider from the base to the mid-section before tightening once more towards the top, making it appear to bow out over people on street level, Reichman told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the drama,\u201d he added. Challenges However, the process wasn\u2019t all plain sailing. \u201cIt was difficult to achieve what we wanted because the space and the plot is kind of small,\u201d said Coto, with the building fitting into a 1.25-acre plot of land. Meanwhile, local building regulations imposed strict standards, explained Reichman, taking into account the low-lying land and propensity for flooding. \u201cThey were some of the most amazing challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to withstand the flooding with the windows that are on street level.\u201d There were further obstacles due to the curved shape of the building, which means that units on the east side have an individual architectural structural component. Aston Martin touches Homeowners are able to customize their interior space with the help of the Aston Martin design team, with three style packages \u2013 Timeless, Covert and Indulgent \u2013 drawing on the company\u2019s British heritage, as well as the building\u2019s context. \u201cIt needs to have part of the DNA of an Aston Martin,\u201d Reichman said. \u201cBut we are in Miami, you don\u2019t have a cold November evening where you need to put the log fire on, so you\u2019ve got to be considerate of the environment that you\u2019re in.\u201d Design elements running through the building include doors with bespoke Aston Martin handles, number plinths and kestrel tan leather door tabs. Aston Martin said that 99% of the properties sold before the building was completed. Residences were sold for $1.5 million to $8.5 million, while penthouses ranged from $16 million to $59 million. The Unique Triplex Penthouse, on the market for $59 million, comes with the last remaining Aston Martin Vulcan, an 820 brake horsepower all-carbon fiber supercar, of which only 24 exist, a spokesman for the company said. Meanwhile, buyers of the 47 Signature and Penthouse units were also able to choose between an Aston Martin DBX sports SUV or the company\u2019s DB11 sportscar. Aston Martin isn\u2019t the first luxury carmaker to enter the residential property market. A 63-story building from Bentley will open in 2026 along the coastline of Sunny Isles Beach, Florida. Featuring 216 units, the property will have an elevator designed to take residents up to their doorstep while seated inside their cars.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/02/style/aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_06_05_middleeast_israel-top-court-sde-teiman-hearing-intl", "text": "Israel has transferred hundreds of Palestinian detainees out of the shadowy detention facility of Sde Teiman in Israel\u2019s Negev desert, a state attorney told Israel\u2019s Supreme Court on Wednesday during a first-ever hearing about the facility where prisoners from Gaza have allegedly been held under conditions of extreme abuse. State attorney Aner Helman told the court that 700 inmates had been moved to Ofer military facility in the occupied West Bank, with another 500 set to be transferred in the weeks to come. Around 200 detainees will remain in Sde Teiman, said Helman, who added that the state would provide an update on their status within three days. The hearing comes in response to a petition by the Association for Civil Rights in Israel (ACRI) and other human rights groups, which drew heavily on CNN reporting about the makeshift prison to make a case for it to be shut down. During a tense exchange, one of the Supreme Court justices, Judge Barak Erez, pressed the state\u2019s legal team on the legality of the way the facility was being run. \u201cThe question is whether or not the Israeli law for the imprisonment of unlawful combatants applies or not. That you did not answer,\u201d said Erez. Avi Segal, an attorney representing the right-wing, Israeli legal organization Shurat HaDin which had asked to join the procedure, said the hearing was based on \u201cnewspaper rumors.\u201d \u201cThe court should be worried about setting up a hearing, and even asking for a response to petitions based on newspaper rumors,\u201d said Segal. CNN\u2019s investigation, in which Israeli whistleblowers as well as Palestinian former detainees and eyewitnesses described horrific conditions at the facility, including continuous blindfolding and handcuffing, sparked an international outcry. The White House called the allegations detailed in CNN\u2019s report \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d and said it was reaching out to Israeli officials for answers. Germany\u2019s Foreign Office condemned the reported practices and said it was campaigning for the International Committee of the Red Cross to access the camp and other prisons. In the wake of CNN\u2019s investigation, United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture and Unlawful Combatants, Alice Jill Edwards, called for Israel to investigate allegations of\u00a0torture and\u00a0mistreatment of detained Palestinians. Last week, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi said the military launched a probe into the allegations of mistreatment at Sde Teiman, as well as at Anatot and Ofer, two other military detention camps for Palestinians from Gaza. The committee tasked with examining the conditions of Palestinian detainees from Gaza is set to submit its recommendations to Halevi this month. \u201cThey cannot keep holding people there, not even for a short while, not even only 200, and not even one week,\u201d ACRI\u2019s attorney Roni Pelli told CNN after the hearing. Since the start of the war on October 7, 36 prisoners held at military detention camps have died, according to the IDF spokesperson\u2019s office. The dead included prisoners \u201cwith previous illnesses or injuries caused to them as a result of the ongoing hostilities,\u201d the statement said. \u201cIn accordance with the law and IDF directives, in each case of death of a detainee in an IDF detention facility, a criminal investigation is opened by the Military Police,\u201d the statement added. On May 10, CNN released an investigation into Sde Teiman, a military base in the Negev desert which has doubled as a detention center for Palestinians detained over the course of Israel\u2019s\u00a0war in\u00a0Gaza which was launched after the October 7 Hamas-led attack on Israel. Three Israeli whistleblowers told CNN that Palestinian detainees at the facility were constantly blindfolded and held under extreme physical restraint. Doctors sometimes amputated prisoners\u2019 limbs due to injuries sustained from continuous handcuffing, one whistleblower said.\u00a0The account tallied with details of\u00a0a letter authored by a doctor\u00a0working at\u00a0Sde Teiman published by Ha\u2019aretz\u00a0in April. According to the accounts, the camp some 18 miles from the Gaza frontier is split into two parts: enclosures holding scores of detainees from Gaza, and a field hospital where wounded detainees are blindfolded, strapped to their beds, wearing diapers and fed through straws. In a May 20 response to a petition led by the rights group Public Committee Against Torture in Israel (PCATI), the Israeli government said it is set to \u201creduce the number of inmates held in military facilities in general and the facility of Sde Teiman in particular, with the intention that this facility will be used as a reception, interrogation and initial sorting facility, for keeping prisoners for short periods only.\u201d Responding to CNN\u2019s request for comment on all the allegations made in its May 10 report, the Israeli military, known as the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), said in a statement: \u201cThe IDF ensures proper conduct towards the detainees in custody. Any allegation of misconduct by IDF soldiers is examined and dealt with accordingly. In appropriate cases, MPCID (Military Police Criminal Investigation\u2019s Division) investigations are opened when there is suspicion of misconduct justifying such action.\u201d \u201cDetainees are handcuffed based on their risk level and health status. Incidents of unlawful handcuffing are not known to the authorities.\u201d The IDF did not directly deny accounts of people being stripped of their clothing or held in diapers. Instead, the Israeli military said that the detainees are given back their clothing once the IDF has determined that they pose no security risk.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/middleeast/israel-top-court-sde-teiman-hearing-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "world"}}

The blaze was still burning on Wednesday afternoon, more than 24 hours after it began, and authorities and citizens in the Danish capital have started reckoning with the loss of one of the city\u2019s most recognizable landmarks. Local firefighters continued to try to put out the fire, which ripped through\u00a0the building \u2013 known locally as B\u00f8rsen \u2013\u00a0from early Tuesday, reaching all its floors and causing the collapse of a dragon-tail spire that had long been a symbol of the city. The walls of the building are still standing, but the interior has been significantly damaged and the roof is partially collapsed. Firefighters used cranes to hose water down into the building. Copenhagen\u00a0police meanwhile launched an investigation on Wednesday, which they said will be a \u201ccomplicated process.\u201d Police officer Brian Belling said authorities have already \u201cconducted interviews, secured surveillance and carried out a large number of investigative steps.\u201d \u201cBut of course, there is still a lot to do, especially as we have not yet had the opportunity to examine\u00a0B\u00f8rsen itself,\u201d Belling added. The 17th century building exemplified the style of the Dutch Renaissance, and housed a number of artworks, some of which were saved on Tuesday. Residents were stunned by the outbreak, which brought back memories of the fire that tore through the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris exactly five years and a day earlier. \u201cMy first thought was (that) I hope that they rebuild it \u2013 it\u2019s never going to be the same but it\u2019s iconic to\u00a0Copenhagen\u00a0and Denmark,\u201d teacher Eva Simoni Lomholdt, 58, told Reuters. Brian Mikkelsen, the CEO of the Danish Chamber of Commerce which owns the building, told the news agency that a firefighter gave him the top of the spire on Wednesday morning after it was recovered following its fall. \u201cIt gives me hope because we have decided to rebuild the stock exchange because it\u2019s part of European history as a trading continent,\u201d he said. The old stock exchange \u2013 located only a few minutes walk from Christiansborg\u00a0Palace \u2013 dates back to 1625. It was built in the Dutch Renaissance style at the request of King Christian IV and had recently been undergoing renovations with its facade covered in scaffolding and protective coverings. It has been at the heart of Danish business since then; while it no longer houses the Danish stock exchange, it serves as the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce. Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said Tuesday a \u201cpiece of Danish history\u201d was on fire, calling the building \u201cirreplaceable.\u201d Denmark\u2019s culture minister Jakob Engel-Schmidt added that 400 years of cultural heritage had been damaged. \u201cHow touching it is to see how the employees at B\u00f8rsen, good people from the emergency services and passers-by work together to rescue art treasures and iconic images from the burning building,\u201d he said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/17/style/copenhagen-stock-exchange-fire-police-investigation-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "world"}}

Israel had been told it is being placed on the list of offenders that harm children in the Secretary-General\u2019s annual report of children in armed conflict to be sent to the UNSC next Friday, Dujarric said. Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad were also added to the list, according to a diplomatic source. Dujarric added that the Israeli UN mission was called by the Secretary-General\u2019s chief of staff on Friday, a courtesy afforded to countries that are newly listed. \u201cIt is done to give those countries a heads up and avoid leaks,\u201d he said. Israeli Ambassador to the UN Gilad Erdan, made a video recording of the phone call from the UN and leaked part of it on social media. In the video, Erdan can be heard expressing his outrage at the UN decision saying, \u201cThe IDF is the most moral army in the world. The one who entered the \u2018blacklist\u2019 today is the UN Secretary-General, who encourages and incentives terrorism and acts out of hatred for Israel. Shame on him!\u201d Dujarric said it was \u201cshocking and unacceptable\u201d that Erdan had published the private call, saying it was \u201csomething he had never seen in my 24 years serving this organization.\u201d Israel\u2019s inclusion on the list comes after eight months of war in Gaza, in which more than 15,500 children have been killed, according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza. The UN\u2019s so-called \u2018blacklist\u2019 has previously included countries such as Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen.

That morning \u2013 on 5 December \u2013 the shells found me,\u201d the 43-year-old bearded soldier, who now uses a wheelchair, told CNN in Berlin, as he pointed\u00a0to where his legs should be. Instead, there are two stumps: One of his legs is amputated just below the knee joint, the other is amputated above the knee. Fellow Ukrainian soldier Vitaliy Sayko-Kazakov, 42, served in the 19th Separate Rifle Battalion in Chervonopopivka, on the front line where Ukraine\u2019s Luhansk and Donetsk regions meet. His left leg was torn off during a battle with Russian forces on July 1 last year. \u201cI immediately put a tourniquet on myself and luckily remained conscious. On adrenaline, I guess, I saved myself,\u201d he said. His right leg sustained serious injuries with an open fracture and eventually had to be amputated in Lviv, he told CNN earlier this month in Berlin. For three months he was confined to his hospital bed. Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine has killed tens of thousands and left even more with lost limbs and other life-altering injuries since the full-scale invasion began in February 2022. German officials estimate there are between 30,000 and 50,000 Ukrainian amputees as a result of the conflict. Obtaining adequate prosthetic limbs and care is tough inside Ukraine. Now a German non-governmental organization is working to bring wounded Ukrainian soldiers to Berlin so they can be fitted with custom-made artificial limbs and given treatment that will allow them to lead as normal a life as possible. Kushnirov and Sayko-Kazakov are among the first of 60 severely wounded Ukrainian soldiers who will receive treatment in Germany, thanks to the Berlin-based NGO \u201cLife Bridge Ukraine.\u201d They hope to start what they see as a new life soon. \u201cMy doctor called and said there was an opportunity to go abroad for me to receive prosthetics. So, I said OK,\u201d Vitaliy said. \u201cOnce there were hundreds of us, now there are thousands of people like me.\u201d Limbs amputated quickly to save lives Marko G\u00e4nsl, from German health care company Seeger,\u00a0is among five orthopedic technicians in Berlin who build custom-made prostheses for the soldiers. When CNN visited the wounded soldiers in their accommodation center for the first time, G\u00e4nsl was assessing the new patients. Bending over Kushnirov\u2019s leg stumps, he softly felt along them. \u201cAre you in pain?\u201d he asked.\u00a0Kushnirov shook his head as a translator relayed the question. \u201cLet me know if anything hurts,\u201d G\u00e4nsl said, taking out a tape to measure the stumps. He and other orthopedic technicians assessed the condition of Kushnirov\u2019s limbs. Battlefield conditions in Ukraine mean limbs must often be amputated quickly to save soldiers\u2019 lives. \u201cThe severity of the amputations often leave the survivors with stumps that won\u2019t allow for the fitting of regular-sized prosthetics,\u201d said G\u00e4nsl. \u201cAnd of course we are dealing here with completely different requirements (than what orthopedic technicians are used to in Germany).\u201d It will be relatively easy to provide a prosthesis for Kushnirov\u2019s right leg, G\u00e4nsl\u00a0said. However, his left leg will be more difficult to treat because it was amputated above the knee. G\u00e4nsl moved on to inspect the next patient: 27-year-old Valerii Omelchenko, who was drafted into the war three months after Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. \u201cI was on duty defending my country on November 23 last year when a Russian drone flew over me and a grenade exploded right in front of me,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cI jumped away and pulled my legs into my chest to protect myself from the explosion which I knew was coming. But look at my legs, they are injured badly.\u201d Sitting in a wheelchair with his left leg amputated and the other one badly bruised and shattered, Omelchenko added: \u201cBut at least I am still alive.\u201d Keen to save his damaged leg, doctors in Germany kept it in a metal frame, or external fixator, at first while it healed. That has just been removed and he will be fitted with a prosthesis on the other leg soon.

Under its auspices, experts in workshops in Berlin will make new limbs and teach the 60 patients chosen for treatment how to walk and move again. Von Wolfersdorff traveled\u00a0to Ukraine herself with a medical team to assess some of the most seriously injured soldiers. \u201cIt\u2019s a challenge to find the right patients in Ukraine. There are so many complex cases. At the same time, there are too few orthopedic technicians in Ukraine to provide all war victims with fast, adequate and good care,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cWe want to give Ukrainian war-wounded soldiers a new life\u00a0\u2013\u00a0and simultaneously want to train six Ukrainians for three months here in Berlin, who will learn to build very good quality prosthetics so that they can do it themselves in Kyiv.\u201d Von Wolfersdorff is collaborating closely with Kyiv\u2019s Mayor Vitali Klitschko and Berlin\u2019s Governing Mayor Kai Wegner on the project, hoping that a prosthetics center will be opened in Kyiv later this year. Ultimately,\u00a0her group wants to open further prosthetics centres in other Ukrainian cities as well. \u201cThe trainees learn here first-hand when a stump may need another amputation, another surgery, when a scar needs to be attended to again, and other issues that arise during this very complex process,\u201d Von Wolfersdorff\u00a0said. CNN met with Ukrainian trainee Volodymyr Havrylov in the Seeger workshop. \u201cIt takes time to train to do it correctly and get every detail right,\u201d he said. In the past few weeks, he has learnt that \u201csurgeons need to make a good stump. The better the stump is, the easier for us to make a stump receiver.\u201d Each patient requires a different treatment, Havrylov said, explaining that \u201csometimes the limb is too short, sometimes it is long\u00a0\u2013\u00a0sometimes there is not enough space for the fitting. Sometimes patients still have pain somewhere.\u201d Oftentimes there are other medical conditions that could influence the fitting of prosthetic limbs. Havrylov said he wants to learn \u201cas much as possible from the Germans and maybe even get better at it so that we can open our center in Kyiv and help there. Unfortunately, there will be more people with injuries. We need good workshops to provide our Ukrainians with a good life. We need to bring them back into society.\u201d Life Bridge Ukraine has collected around $600,000 in donations for the project, including for the care of the soldiers in Berlin. \u201cIt is a long process of recuperation,\u201d Von Wolfersdorff said. \u201cWe seek a holistic treatment approach:\u00a0In addition to a lot of physiotherapy, patients are offered psychological help, as well as nutritional advice, to reintegrate themselves into as\u00a0normal as possible\u00a0a\u00a0life.\u201d \u2018Completely new way of learning to walk\u2019 A few weeks later, CNN joined Kushnirov and Sayko-Kazakov for their first fittings in Seeger\u2019s Berlin workshop. Vitaliy looked at his new artificial limbs and smiled. \u201cThese are my two legs,\u201d he said, pointing at his new prosthetic limbs. \u201cOne and two. We are going to fit them today.\u201d With the help of the medical and orthopedic technician teams Sayko-Kazakov took his first steps\u00a0using them.\u00a0\u201cThese are cool feet. Really fine work.\u201d For Kushnirov, the initial fitting was trickier because of the artificial knee joint on one limb. \u201cUnfortunately walking will be more difficult for him,\u201d G\u00e4nsl explained. \u201cIt is a completely new way of learning how to walk.\u201d Kushnirov knows his rehabilitation process will take time, but he is determined to keep trying. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame I am losing so much time getting rehabilitated and I know it will still take me a lot of time. But of course, my life will improve,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s hard to say what life will be like after my prosthetics fittings. I know it will be different.\u201d Sayko-Kazakov, Kushnirov and the other soldiers with new artificial limbs will receive a lot of training on how to move again in the coming weeks in Berlin. Any final adjustments that are needed will be made before they receive their permanent prosthetic fittings and leave to be cared for back home in Ukraine. \u201cIt is a lot of fun working together with our highly motivated patients and Ukrainian trainees, we see so much progress,\u201d G\u00e4nsl said. However, there will be challenges ahead for these soldiers even with their final artificial limbs. \u201cProsthetic fittings need to be adjusted again and again. It is a lifelong process,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter all, bodies change. Just as we occasionally put on weight over Christmas or lose weight when exercising, a stump does not grow with you.\u201d Both Sayko-Kazakov and Kushnirov are determined to return to Ukraine soon, walking comfortably with their new artificial limbs. They say they\ufeff are ready to support their units back home as they fight to fend off Russian forces. \u201cThe war is not yet over. Our work is not yet finished,\u201d Sayko-Kazakov said. \u201cI\u00a0often think of the guys who worked with me at the front line. So many lost their lives. So many I carried out on my shoulders. It hurts. When we go back, we can be useful on the home front, for example assembling drones.\u201d Kushnirov acknowledges his limitations\ufeff. \u201cI know I won\u2019t be able to walk again just like others do. I won\u2019t be able to fight at the front line anymore,\u201d he said, \u201cbut there are a lot of other things I can do: I could operate a drone or take care of repair and maintenance works. Wherever I can help, I will do so. I will continue to fight for Ukraine.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/europe/ukraine-soldiers-germany-prosthetic-limbs-intl-cmd/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "world"}}

The killing occurred in Bogot\u00e1 in January 2023, and has since captured public attention in Colombia. Before her death, Trespalacios was beginning to gain success at music festivals and had been in a romantic relationship with Poulos since 2021, according to accounts from her family and lawyers who took her case. The Office of the Attorney General of Colombia said in a statement after the ruling that its prosecutors had proven that Poulos struck and suffocated his partner and tried to hide the body. \u201cThe security camera records show that the aggressor wrapped the victim\u2019s body, hid it in a suitcase and abandoned it in a garbage container in the town of Fontib\u00f3n, in the west of Bogot\u00e1. It was found there hours later by the authorities,\u201d the AG office said. During Tuesday\u2019s court proceedings, the judge considered that the evidence presented by the prosecutors was sufficient to determine Poulos\u2019 guilt, imposing a prison sentence of 42 years and eight months \u2013 about five years less than what prosecutors had requested. Additionally, the judge prohibited Poulos from approaching or attempting to communicate with Trespalacios\u2019 family for 20 years, and ordered that he be expelled from Colombia once he completes his sentence. Poulos\u2019 defense team has said it will appeal the judgement. It had argued that Poulos was innocent of femicide and that he should instead be tried for homicide, which would carry a lesser sentence. In Colombia, femicide \u2014 the killing of a woman because of her gender \u2014 is considered a more serious crime than homicide. Under Colombian law, femicide is often punished with a higher penalty. Defense lawyer Fredy Sp\u00edndola told the Focus Noticias channel that he and his client believe the witnesses \u201cwere all in cahoots, that they all said the same thing.\u201d The victim\u2019s legal team, meanwhile, celebrated the sentence, saying it recognizes that Trespalacios was a victim of various types of violence. \u201cIt is a fair decision for us, which is also consistent with the material evidentiary elements, with the theory of the case that we had from the beginning. From the beginning, we established that we were facing objectification, an instrumentalization of a woman through various factors, psychological violence, violence of various types, including physical violence,\u201d lawyer Miguel \u00c1ngel del R\u00edo told Focus Noticias. Poulos was detained in Panama in January 2023, when he was trying to fly to Turkey. He was then deported to Colombia, where he denied the charges against him. He was sentenced almost a year and a half after Trespalacios\u2019 death. Del R\u00edo also pointed out that only until the conviction is made final in a second-instance appellate court will Trespalacios\u2019 family be able to seek reparation for damages.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/americas/american-john-poulos-sentenced-valentina-trespalacios-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_07_sport_jannik-sinner-carlos-alcaraz-french-open-semifinals-spt-intl", "text": "Carlos Alcaraz edged past Jannik Sinner in a five-set thriller to book his place in the French Open final for the first time in his career, prevailing 2-6 6-3 3-6 6-4 6-3. The youngsters showed why the future of tennis is in safe hands, pulling out a plethora of stunning shots in front of an enthralled crowd on Philippe Chatrier. Alcaraz, 21, got off to a slow start in the match, losing eight of the first 10 games, but fought his way back into a contest that swung back and forth during the entirety of its grueling four hours and nine minutes of action. The Spaniard, who is the youngest man to reach a grand slam final on all three surfaces, will now have the chance to win his third grand slam title in Sunday\u2019s final, where he will face either Alex Zverev or Casper Ruud. \u201cProbably the toughest matches that I\u2019ve played in my short career have been against Jannik,\u201d Alcaraz said in his on-court interview after the match. \u201cThe US Open in 2022 and this one. \u201cJannik is a great player, the team he has as well, the great work he puts in every day and I hope to play many, many more matches like this one against Jannik - but one of the toughest matches I\u2019ve played for sure.\u201d Cheered on by a boisterous crowd that featured many Spanish flags and football shirts, Alcaraz then thanked the fans for their backing in his native tongue. \u201cTo the Spaniards that are in here, to all the Spanish speakers, thank you so much for coming,\u201d he said to huge cheers. \u201cThe truth is I feel privileged to play in front of you every game. Thank you from the heart and I\u2019ll see you in the final.\u201d A French Open classic Sinner, 22, who will be the new world No. 1 on Monday, got off to a blistering start, breaking Alcaraz in the opening game of the match. Alcaraz had his serve broken again in his very next service game, as Sinner raced into an early 4-0 lead behind a booming serve and bludgeoning groundstrokes. There was a brief reprieve for Alcaraz, who earned back one of the breaks of serve, but Sinner found another gear to break the Spaniard for a third time before comfortably closing out the opening set. Alcaraz still had no answer to his opponent\u2019s relentless power and accuracy and committed a number of unforced errors at the start of the second set as he attempted to find a way through a so far infallible Sinner. Those errors gifted Sinner another break of serve and an early 2-0 lead. All of a sudden, however, Alcaraz began to show why he is tipped by many to be the future dominant force in tennis. After initially struggling to keep pace, Alcaraz began to dominate proceedings as he finally found his range, placing his shots on the lines and in the corners with unerring accuracy. That helped him rattle off five straight games to turn the set on its head and eventually take it 6-3 to level the match with a roar of \u201cvamos!\u201d In a matter of minutes, the players\u2019 demeanors had changed completely. Previously cutting a frustrated figure, exchanging words at times with his box, Alcaraz was now strutting around Chatrier with confidence. The match was turning into a real slog for both players, who were pummelling the ball and pushing each other to the brink in every service game. After an early exchange of breaks, Sinner started struggling with cramp in his hands and forearms while serving at 2-2, at one point his fingers contorted between points. His serve appeared to be most affected by the cramp, but his crushing forehand remained as powerful as ever and he was able fight through the game and hold serve. After being tended to by the physio, Sinner came out a man reborn and broke Alcaraz with a stunning backhand pass as the Spaniard became a little too eager to deploy the serve-and-volley tactic. It proved to be the decisive break in the set as Sinner, now apparently unperturbed by the cramp, closed it out 6-3. There was then nothing to separate the two men in the fourth set. Both players were displaying a mind-bending array of shots, but Alcaraz left mouths agape when he hit an absurd passing forehand at full stretch, almost ending up in the stands. As brilliantly as Alcaraz was playing, however, he was unable to make a dent in Sinner\u2019s serve as the Italian speedily rattled off game after game. Despite struggling with his return of serve, Alcaraz found another level when it mattered most, breaking Sinner with the Italian serving at 4-5 in the set. It was yet more spectacular shot-making that gave Alcaraz an early break of serve in the fifth set, stretching every sinew to flick a backhand past Sinner at the net to set up break point, which was converted with a crushing forehand winner. From there, there was no way back for Sinner. Alcaraz will have spent many of his formative years watching compatriot and idol Rafael Nadal winning final after final at Roland Garros. Now, he has the chance to emulate his hero.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/sport/jannik-sinner-carlos-alcaraz-french-open-semifinals-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_06_europe_european-parliament-elections-2024-explained-intl", "text": "One of the world\u2019s largest democratic exercises is underway, with some 373 million people across the European Union eligible to vote in elections for the next European Parliament. Voters in the 27 nations of the EU head to the polls from Thursday to Sunday to elect 720 members of the parliament, which will play a crucial role in shaping the priorities and political direction of the bloc for the next five years. The vote comes at a pivotal moment for the EU, which is grappling with issues ranging from the wars in Ukraine and Gaza to immigration and climate change. Polls have predicted big gains for hard-right parties in a number of countries, which could have long-term implications for the continent. Here\u2019s what you need to know about the world\u2019s biggest multi-country election. How do the elections work? The elections are held over four days every five years in June. This year, they are taking place between\u00a0June\u00a06\u00a0and\u00a09. They are held over multiple days because, despite being elections to an EU institution, they are still arranged and managed as national\u00a0ballots\u00a0by each of the EU\u2019s 27 member states.  In some countries, they may all be\u00a0held\u00a0on a single day, whereas others take place over several days. Because the elections are managed at a national level, they are not all carried out in the same exact way. However, they must all employ a proportional representation system\u00a0\u2013where the number of lawmakers\u00a0elected\u00a0to the parliament directly correlates to the percentage of people who voted for them. Once all the votes have been counted, each national political party will be assigned a number of\u00a0members of European Parliament (MEPs)\u00a0relative to their vote share. It is up to the member states to determine how this is assigned. Once they have been appointed to the parliament, MEPs can then join a European political party, which allows them to sit in a group in the parliament. These parties and groupings are multinational and based on a loose set of shared beliefs.\u00a0The bigger the grouping, the more influence it has in parliament. Results will start to come in late on Sunday, but full results will not be known until at least Monday. What\u2019s the point of the European Parliament and what do MEPs do? The European Parliament sits primarily in Brussels, Belgium, but moves roughly once a month to Strasbourg, France. It is the legislative branch of the EU and one of the bloc\u2019s three main institutions \u2013 along with the European Commission, which is the executive branch, and the European Council, which is made up of ministers from the governments of the 27 member states. It is the only EU institution where\u00a0representatives\u00a0are directly elected,\u00a0and MEPs pass laws which are applied all over the bloc. In order for any legislation to be implemented, both the council and parliament have to agree. One of the parliament\u2019s most crucial roles is approving the makeup of the commission, which is ultimately responsible for the political direction of the world\u2019s largest trading bloc, and it has the final say on who is appointed as president of the commission. Currently the top job is filled by Germany\u2019s Ursula von der Leyen, who is seeking a second term at the helm. The parliament also has\u00a0ultimate approval\u00a0over\u00a0the billions of euros allocated in the EU budget. It often has the final\u00a0word\u00a0on major policy issues\u00a0such as\u00a0the budget, trade\u00a0and\u00a0sanctions on foreign nationals. The parliament can also put major international objectives in the deep freeze. For example, A comprehensive mutual investment agreement between the EU and China is effectively on hold while some MEPs are under sanctions from China. The parliament as a whole has refused to advance the agreement until the sanctions are lifted. What are the biggest issues in this vote? Since this week\u2019s election is in effect 27 individual national elections, some\u00a0issues are in play in some countries but not in others. Broadly speaking, immigration, climate change, security and support for Ukraine are issues that matter across the bloc. While\u00a0irregular\u00a0migration figures are lower than they were\u00a0during\u00a0the 2015-2016\u00a0refugee\u00a0crisis, it is still a sensitive issue across the EU, as some countries\u00a0bear a disproportionate share of\u00a0the burden\u00a0while\u00a0others are loathe to\u00a0do their part. Slowing the effects of climate change and making Europe greener has been a priority for a long time. However, some countries now balk at the cost of\u00a0cutting fossil fuel emissions. The EU is largely united on its support for Ukraine, but that too could be affected if populists like\u00a0France\u2019s Marine\u00a0Le Pen are elected\u00a0to lead national governments. What are the political groupings? If the\u00a0720 MEPs representing 27 countries and hundreds of different domestic political parties\u00a0were all left to their own devices, things would\u00a0get very complicated. To simplify the work of the parliament, leaders of national governments form alliances with each other based on their shared political beliefs \u2013 the European political parties. If\u00a0a politician is\u00a0a member of, for example, French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s Renaissance party in France,\u00a0he or she\u00a0will stand for that party as an MEP at a national level. If\u00a0they\u00a0are then elected to the European Parliament,\u00a0they\u00a0will join the centrist, liberal European party, Renew Europe \u2013\u00a0which currently has members from 24 of the 27 EU members. Once\u00a0seated\u00a0in parliament,\u00a0they\u00a0will sit alongside the other MEPs from Renew parties in other countries as a political grouping. There are seven main groupings, ranging from the extremes of the far right to the far left. The two dominant groupings are the center-right conservative European People\u2019s Party (EPP) and the center-left\u00a0Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D). Due to proportional representation, no single group has anything resembling a majority and therefore\u00a0they\u00a0must form broad coalitions\u00a0to get anything done in parliament. The EPP and S&D (or their previous incarnations) have dominated this coalition\u00a0for decades. While these two parties are still expected to be the largest after the elections, all eyes are on the other main right-wing groups,\u00a0the\u00a0European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) and the hard-right, populist Identity and Democracy (ID). What\u2019s likely to happen in the election? It is expected that the EPP and S&D centrist coalition will largely hold. However, it is also expected that ECR and ID will make significant gains that result\u00a0in more power in the next parliament. The two hard-right parties have not said they will work together and the leaderships of the two groups are known to dislike each other. Giorgia Meloni, the Italian prime minister and president of the ECR\u00a0bloc, has an eye on working with the mainstream right at an EU level, for instance. During\u00a0the\u00a02022 Italian\u00a0general\u00a0election, much was made of Meloni\u2019s right-wing rhetoric. She was a hardliner on immigration,\u00a0and\u00a0had\u00a0questioned LGBTQ+ rights, among other things. However, since winning she has been pragmatic in working with\u00a0those in power\u00a0at a European level \u2013 most notably\u00a0von der Leyen, the commission\u2019s president, who is herself a member of the more mainstream EPP. Von der Leyen even went so far as\u00a0to visit\u00a0the Italian island of Lampedusa, which has\u00a0been\u00a0an arrival point for\u00a0large numbers of irregular\u00a0migrants, to set out a\u00a010-point EU plan\u00a0to support Italy with the influx. Critics say that\u00a0Meloni\u00a0has sold out; supporters say that she has played her cards perfectly and managed to pull the EU\u2019s center in her direction.\u00a0Evidence of this might be the EU\u00a0having\u00a0finally\u00a0agreed a deal\u00a0earlier\u00a0this year\u00a0on how it would share the\u00a0weight\u00a0of irregular migration, after years of deadlock and negotiation. How could the election affect European politics? The\u00a0possibility\u00a0that the EU\u2019s political center might be up for grabs\u00a0is the most important context of these elections. The opaque and fluid nature of politics at a European level means that a lot can change over the course of a five-year period. Between the EPP and S&D, there might be a centrist coalition on day one of this\u00a0new\u00a0parliament. But these are not formal coalitions, rather loose alliances that vote together, issue by issue. This is where the idea of a\u00a0right-wing\u00a0ECR and ID axis becomes significant. The rise of the far-right\u2019s influence in European Parliament follows a similar trend at the national level in a number of major EU member states. National\u00a0elections\u00a0are\u00a0set to take place in France in 2027,\u00a0in which\u00a0right-wing populist\u00a0Le Pen could emerge victorious. She is the chair of ID and has recently made obvious efforts to detoxify the\u00a0bloc\u00a0by expelling\u00a0lawmakers from\u00a0the far-right Alternative for Germany\u00a0(AfD)\u00a0from\u00a0its ranks\u00a0following accusations of antisemitism.\u00a0 A\u00a0victory in the French presidential election would\u00a0of course\u00a0make Le Pen a much bigger major player in European politics. That might not mean any formal coalition between the center-right EPP and ID, but the politics of the European Parliament is a sliding scale of sorts and, if France shifts right, it\u2019s fair to say the center-right will take note. There are EPP members (and certainly ECR members) who will agree with ID members on\u00a0matters\u00a0such as\u00a0immigration and climate change. When those issues come up and the parliament has a role to play, it\u2019s not implausible that\u00a0the\u00a0ECR and ID could\u00a0then put\u00a0huge pressure on EPP lawmakers to vote the same way. It is, after all, always worth remembering that these people must still answer to their domestic voters, who can sack them at the next election.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/europe/european-parliament-elections-2024-explained-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_06_06_india_india-opposition-rahul-gandhi-election-analysis-intl-hnk", "text": "At the start of the year, Narendra Modi launched his unofficial election campaign from the steps of a grand Hindu temple. India was about to enter a \u201cdivine\u201d era, he said, declaring the beginning of a \u201cnew time cycle.\u201d January\u2019s inauguration of the Ram Mandir, on the site of a destroyed mosque, analysts said, was the latest and most significant step in a years-long project, moving India away from its secular, pluralist founding principles and toward a new future as a Hindu nation. On Tuesday night, Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lost its seat in the town where the temple stands. The loss sent shock waves through a country where a firebrand ideology of Hindu nationalism has \u2013 over the last decade of Modi\u2019s leadership \u2013 been thrust into to the center of daily life. But as the election results showed, for many voters, his BJP\u2019s strident ideology could not compensate for far more pressing local issues, including soaring unemployment and rising inflation. The opposition \u2013 which had been all but written off by many pundits and polls \u2013 put on a far stronger showing than expected, winning seats in BJP strongholds while denting Modi\u2019s aura of invincibility. The INDIA alliance, a grouping of dozens of political parties with a breadth of political positions, won 235 out of 543 seats in the lower house of Parliament, denying the BJP its dream of forming a supermajority \u2013 and with it a mandate to enact radical change. The star face of that alliance, Indian National Congress lawmaker Rahul Gandhi, had long been ridiculed by Modi, disregarded by many analysts as an ineffective and weak leader. Not so anymore. Voters have sent a \u201cclear message\u201d to Modi, Gandhi said Tuesday night. \u201cWe do not want you.\u201d Though the opposition lost, for many it felt like a win. Modi will enter a third consecutive term as India\u2019s prime minister \u2013 becoming only the second person to do so - but must rely on his coalition allies in a way he has never done before. \u201cThe people\u2019s mandate has given befitting reply to the BJP and their politics of hate, corruption,\u201d Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge told reporters Wednesday. \u201cThis is a mandate in defense of the Constitution of India\u2026 and (a mandate) to save democracy.\u201d \u2018Not a normal contest\u2019 While the BJP alone still won more seats than the INDIA alliance combined, by many critics\u2019 accounts, there wasn\u2019t a level playing field. \u201cThis was not a normal contest,\u201d Indian activist Yogendra Yadav, told local news channel India Today. Gandhi, the scion of a political dynasty that has produced three prime ministers, was last year disqualified as a lawmaker, and handed a two-year jail sentence for defamation, in a ruling his supporters say was politically motivated. Gandhi was later reinstated as a lawmaker following an intervention from India\u2019s Supreme Court \u2013 and didn\u2019t serve prison time. Weeks before the election began, the Congress accused the BJP of crippling its ability to campaign after its accounts were frozen by the tax department, leaving it unable to use some $20 million in funds. Then came the arrest of Arvind Kejriwal, Delhi chief minister and head of the popular Aam Aadmi Party, who was taken into custody for alleged corruption, and is now back in jail after being released toward the end of the campaign. The BJP has repeatedly denied accusations of political motivation. \u201cHere is a contest where there is a stranglehold on power. The BJP had more money than\u2026 anyone else. They had the entire media of this country lined up as their spokesperson,\u201d Yadav said. \u201cIn this context, getting (235 seats) is defeat. There is no other word for it.\u201d A shift in trends No other place exemplifies the BJP\u2019s disappointment like the state of Uttar Pradesh in India\u2019s north. Home to more than 200 million people, the nation\u2019s most populous state lies in the heart of the \u201cHindi belt\u201d \u2014 the predominantly Hindi-speaking states where support for Modi is especially strong. It is governed by a firebrand monk turned BJP politician, Yogi Adityanath, whose Hindu-first policies have polarized people along religious lines. And on Tuesday, voters there appeared to put their faith in the hands of the INDIA alliance, electing their candidates to 43 out of 80 seats \u2013 seemingly rejecting this populist vision for a Hindu-first nation. The BJP won 33, down from 62 at the previous election. In Banswara, in the western state of Rajasthan, where Modi\u2019s election campaign took its most divisive turn, voters were also turned off. It was there that the Indian leader sparked a row over hate speech when he accused the Congress of wanting to distribute the country\u2019s wealth among Muslims, referring to them as \u201cinfiltrators.\u201d The BJP candidate there, a two-time incumbent lawmaker, lost his seat to a rival from a much smaller, regional party. \u201cThe BJP did not sell its Hindu agenda as much as it thought. Other countervailing factors have impacted the electorate,\u201d said T.V. Paul, a professor from McGill University. Modi did not define a single overarching issue or narrative for the election, so voters focused more on local matters, according to Milan Vaishnav from the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, \u201cIn the absence of that, what we\u2019ve got in a federal country like India is a series of state-by-state, local contests in which more mundane, parochial issues really matter,\u201d he said. \u201cJobs, inflation, local leaders, incumbency, caste, ethnicity, religion and those seem to have worked against the prime minister and his party.\u201d As results began to trickle in Tuesday night, and the Congress learned of its gains across the country, there were scenes of jubilation at its headquarters in the capital New Delhi. \u201cRahul Gandhi is the only hope our country has,\u201d said Lakshman Valhekar, who traveled more than 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) from his home state in Maharashtra for the result. \u201cI believe in them completely. BJP is done. BJP is out.\u201d The electorate has, said Paul from McGill University, \u201coccasionally shown their capacity to make large-scale challenge to any kind of authoritarian order that is being imposed on them.\u201d Sitting in front of a large crowd in New Delhi Tuesday, Gandhi pulled out a small, pocket-sized version of India\u2019s constitution. Holding the red and black book, the leader began to speak. \u201cTo save this,\u201d he said, \u201cwe have taken the first and biggest step.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/india/india-opposition-rahul-gandhi-election-analysis-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_07_americas_panama-migrants-darien-gap-intl-latam", "text": "Panamanian figures show at least 174,513 migrants crossed the treacherous Dari\u00e9n Gap, a mountainous rainforest region connecting South and Central America, from January to June 6 of this year. The latest figures are higher than around the same period in 2023, when more than 166,000 crossings were reported, according to Panama\u2019s National Migration Service. The Dari\u00e9n Gap, which a decade ago was seen as an almost impassable barrier, has continued to see an increase in the number of migrants willing to risk their lives and safety to cross it. According to migration service figures, a record 520,000 people crossed the jungle last year. Experts say many continue to journey towards the United States in search of better opportunities. The National Migration Service of Panama said Thursday that in the first six days of June 2024, at least 4,499 people \u2013 3,598 adults and 901 minors \u2013 arrived in the country. This comes as the number of children crossing the Dari\u00e9n Gap has increased by 40% this year, putting the route on track to see record levels of child migration for the fifth consecutive year, according to a report by the United Nations\u2019 children\u2019s agency. The UNICEF report added that in the first four months of 2024, over 30,000 children crossed the Dari\u00e9n Gap, and that 2,000 were unaccompanied or separated from their families. This comes as Panamanian politicians seek to harden the country\u2019s borders. During his election campaign, Panama\u2019s president-elect Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino said that he wanted to \u201cclose the Dari\u00e9n,\u201d citing safety concerns. He explained in early May that he had proposed to initiate \u201ca repatriation process with full respect for human rights\u201d for the hundreds of thousands of migrants who pass through the area each year. \u201cSo that those from there, and those who would like to come, know that those who arrive here will be returned to their country of origin,\u201d Mulino said. Mulino\u2019s plan may prove unfeasible given that the jungle is 266 kilometers (165 miles) long. Discouraging migrants from crossing could be a tough challenge since many of them pay human smugglers operating on both sides of the borders. \u201cIn practical terms, trying to reduce migration through the Dari\u00e9n is a difficult task. The complexity is not just about entry points, but how to manage and have better information on who is helping migrants get through,\u201d Ariel Ruiz, a policy analyst at the Washington-based Migration Policy Institute, told CNN. The 66-mile (106-kilometer) hike through the Darien Gap brings migrants from Colombia to Panama and is a crucial passage for those hoping to reach the United States and Canada. Mass migration across the Western Hemisphere has\u00a0fueled a growing number\u00a0of people moving north. The journey carries multiple risks for migrants, including robberies, assaults, kidnappings, diseases, wild animal attacks, and accidents in a jungle full of rivers, mountains, and mud flats, according to the UN Refugee agency, UNHCR.

{"id": "2024_05_31_europe_far-right-european-election-intl", "text": "This is a historic and pivotal year for democracy across the globe. Around\u00a070 countries\u00a0\u2013 from the\u00a0United States\u00a0to\u00a0South Africa, via\u00a0Mexico\u00a0and\u00a0Taiwan\u00a0\u2013 will hold elections in 2024. After India\u2019s huge and ongoing six-week ballot, however, the biggest election in terms of voter numbers takes place this week, when 373 million Europeans can go to the polls and elect 720 members of the next European Parliament. Once the votes have been tallied from across the 27-nation bloc, it is widely expected that the results will show a significant shift to the right, which could have major implications for the political direction of the European Union at a time\u00a0when it is battling\u00a0multiple crises,\u00a0many of them global. From the war in Ukraine to coping with mass migration, the rise of China to the threat of climate change, it\u2019s hard to see how a bloc of\u00a0diverse\u00a0countries could possibly speak with one voice. Of course, differences in opinion among\u00a0the\u00a0member states is nothing new. EU politics has always relied on awkward alliances between countries and political ideologies that represent vastly different electorates. The EU\u2019s political center has undeniably moved to the right over the past two decades,\u00a0however. The European Parliament is the place where this is most visible at an EU level. Most\u00a0of the lawmakers (known as MEPs)\u00a0belong to a political party in their own country.\u00a0Once they enter\u00a0the European Parliament\u00a0in the Belgian capital of Brussels, they sit in loose, multinational political groupings that broadly have similar political interests. These groupings then form even looser coalitions,\u00a0which\u00a0usually results with a majority grouping of centrists from the center-left, center-right and liberals somewhere in the middle. The rightward shift of the political center in this coalition has been gradual. In 1994, the main socialist group S&D had the most MEPs. In 1999,\u00a0it was\u00a0overtaken by the center-right European People\u2019s Party (EPP). The EPP, best explained as conservatives in the mold of former German Chancellor Angela Merkel,\u00a0has\u00a0been the dominant force in\u00a0EU\u00a0politics ever since. While the EPP has been able to lead a mainstream centrist coalition with the left and liberals at a European level, MEPs are still beholden to domestic politics happening back in their own countries. For example, it\u2019s not easy for a conservative to work with a liberal on a pan-EU policy that would share the burden of asylum seekers if voters back home are becoming attracted to loud, anti-immigration populists. The louder the domestic noise \u2013 and the greater the risk of losing their own seat in parliament \u2013 the trickier cross-party politics at a Brussels level becomes. The anticipated influx of\u00a0lawmakers into groups\u00a0to the EPP\u2019s right will\u00a0certainly\u00a0complicate matters. While the\u00a0right-wing\u00a0European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) and\u00a0far-right\u00a0Identity and Democracy (ID)\u00a0groups\u00a0are expected to finish fourth and fifth respectively in terms of seat numbers, their combined tally, which could be upwards of 140,\u00a0according to the Politico Poll of Polls, will be hard for the EPP to ignore.\u00a0The EPP is currently predicted to win 165 seats to 143 for the socialist S&D. ECR and ID are typical of European\u00a0Parliament\u00a0parties in that they are home to a pretty broad group of conservatives. The ECR, for example, was founded by former British Prime Minister David Cameron who campaigned against Brexit. Its current chair is Italian PM Giorgia Meloni, who garnered lots of attention during the 2022 Italian election for her opposition to\u00a0LGBTQ+\u00a0rights,\u00a0promises to curb migration and general anti-globalist rhetoric. However, since\u00a0Meloni\u2019s\u00a0election, she has been seen as considerably more moderate and has supported many key EU initiatives, including support for Ukraine. She has also resisted allowing\u00a0authoritarian\u00a0Hungarian\u00a0leader\u00a0Viktor Orban to join the ECR after he left the EPP. Hungary has been the most pro-Russia EU voice since the start of the war. Whether or not it was deliberate on Meloni\u2019s part, resistance to Orban has made working with her and the ECR more palatable to the Brussels establishment, including EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. ID, too, has sought to moderate its image. It\u00a0recently expelled\u00a0the German far-right AfD party from its ranks after one of its most senior MEPs told an Italian newspaper\u00a0that he didn\u2019t see all members of the SS, the notorious Nazi paramilitary group, automatically as criminals. There is quite a wide range in opinion from the moderate wing of the ERC to the fringes of ID, but political\u00a0currents\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0desire for influence\u00a0can result in some\u00a0odd bedfellows, especially in the opaque and fluid world of European politics. It is unlikely that the EPP would be willing to work directly with ID any time soon, but that doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t be important. History has shown us repeatedly that it\u2019s possible to influence policy from outside the tent. Suppose\u00a0that\u00a0parties associated with ID start putting center-right\u00a0politicians\u00a0under pressure in their own countries. You might find the center adopts their policy ideas \u2013\u00a0as has previously happened in France, the\u00a0United Kingdom\u00a0and Germany. And there are\u00a0more than\u00a0enough hot topics in Europe now for the right to get its teeth stuck into. Migration, climate change, border security, military spending, rule of law \u2013 all of these have been flashpoints in pan-Europe politics for a long time and are not going away any time soon. And it is ultimately the newly-elected Parliament that vets and approves the\u00a0make-up\u00a0of the\u00a0European\u00a0Commission \u2013 the EU\u2019s executive body. It\u2019s worth noting that support for Ukraine is expected to be safe\u00a0for the time being, with the pro-Kremlin\u00a0groups appearing\u00a0very\u00a0isolated. But almost everything else will be handled on a case-by-case basis if the numbers work out that way. And the more MEPs elected that are to the right of the EPP, the more their influence could grow over time. Five years is a long time in politics, and that is how long this Parliament will last. In that time, France will hold an election that Marine Le Pen, who is affiliated with ID, might win\u00a0with her National Rally party. Geert Wilders, also ID, is soon expected to form a government in the Netherlands after emerging as the biggest party in their\u00a0November\u00a0elections. In other words, the domestic politics in member states could shift even further to the right, which naturally changes calculations in Brussels. The European Parliament\u00a0can often seem like\u00a0looks\u00a0like a boring, bureaucratic blob, tediously grinding its way through process. But the EU is an increasingly geopolitical player \u2013 able to impose sanctions on Russian and Chinese political figures, provide funds to Ukraine and use its economic heft as the world\u2019s largest trading bloc in diplomacy. If its political center is indeed shifting to the right, its influence will inevitably have\u00a0meaningful\u00a0and\u00a0perhaps far-reaching\u00a0consequences for people\u00a0living beyond Europe\u2019s\u00a0borders.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/europe/far-right-european-election-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "world"}}
