{"id": "2024_06_06_style_black-figurative-art-london-exhibition", "text": "Dressed in an ivory white leotard and tutu, a tall Black figure poses in retir\u00e9. Arms and legs angular, chest turned towards the light. It\u2019s a traditional oil on linen \u2014 the frothy movement of the ballerina skirt almost like an Edgar Degas. The image, a self-portrait of Chicago-born figurative painter Thelonious Stokes, is haunting and formidable. The composition appears split in two: In the dancer\u2019s right hand extended towards the shadows, he holds two thirds of watermelon, while a chicken stands at his feet. His face, turned away from the light, is painted coal black \u2014 a recurring reference throughout Stokes\u2019s work to the racist practice of blackface. As the dancer\u2019s body lifts up elegantly towards the top left of the painting, the figure seems torn, metaphorically snatched backward by this constellation of racialized tropes. Two of Stokes\u2019 oil paintings\u00a0\u2014 \u201cTired of Being a N*gger; Champion of A Fowl; Crossroads red ribbons and chalk lines\u201d (2023)\u00a0 and \u201cThe Cry\u201d (2023) \u2014 are on display at a new London exhibition exploring the boundaries of Black figurative painting. \u201cThe Whole World Smiles With You,\u201d a group show curated by Alayo Akinkugbe at Opera Gallery, offers a more complex view of the genre often overridden, said Akinkgube, by the market\u2019s collective preference for work that expresses \u201cBlack Joy\u201d \u2014 a phrase used to define resistance and liberation through celebration. The show takes its name from the second half of the 1928 song, \u201cWhen You\u2019re Smiling (The Whole World Smiles With You),\u201d made famous by Louis Armstrong. \u201cIt\u2019s this idea that if (a Black person) is happy, then all is good,\u201d Akinkugbe told CNN during a preview of the exhibition. \u201cThese bright, vivid, happy, palatable paintings did really well post-2020,\u201d he said, referencing the killing of George Floyd on May 25 by then-Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin. \u201cThese were the images that were easy for the art world to engage with. But what happens if you don\u2019t make work that\u2019s so overtly Black, joyous or positive?\u201d Split into three themes, Akinkugbe has sought out artists whose work escapes a neat definition. In the bright yellow-green gallery, viewers are first welcomed with giant, sunny portraits by Adjei Taiwah and tall, sumptuous musings on flesh by Amoako Boafo. These are the \u201cbright, vivid\u201d works Akinkugbe notes have been leading the charge. Later, the Black figure is extrapolated completely \u2014 a comment on the racist history of Black caricatures, what happens when the Black physicality is changed according to a political narrative. Faces are obscured by drifting loose threads as in Noel Anderson\u2019s woven image; or, as is the case with multimedia artist Jazz Grant, the vast plains of personhood are rendered literally in collage-style cuttings of clouds, horizons, terrains and textures. \u201cWhen we think of figurative art, it can be quite limited,\u201d said Akinkugbe. \u201cI hope this exhibition shows how sprawling it can be.\u201d Technically, the definition of figurative art is broad \u2014 it\u2019s only prerequisite being that it must depict the human form \u2014 yet it has historically\u00a0 been defined by white painters such as Leonardo da Vinci, Vermeer, David Hockney, Lucien Freud and Jenny Saville. In 2013, two years after his death, Francis Bacon\u2019s 1969 figurative triptych \u201cThree Studies of Lucian Freud\u201d broke the world record for the most expensive painting ever sold at auction. But what happens when your reflection is missing from the gallery walls? You simply paint yourself into the picture. That idea of active representation, of grabbing back the mirror, is Akinkugbe\u2019s final theme. \u201cI\u2019ve always found that very interesting,\u201d she said. \u201cThe ways that artists try to usurp the canon. Either supplanting white figures or bringing them to the fore, adopting tropes of European portraiture but using a Black figure.\u201d \u2018I paint for the Black grandmas of the future\u2019 Stokes calls his penchant for painting classic European Judeo-Christian scenes of Anunications, cherubs and Jesus on the cross using exclusively Black forms \u201cBlackwashing.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s giving people something to have, something to hold,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I was riding through Ghana for the first time in West Africa, I saw a lot of depictions of the Anglo Saxon Christ. It was a little disheartening.\u201d These are not, he insists, reimaginings, as some might be tempted to call them. \u201cThe term reimagining is to neglect so many genuine narratives,\u201d he said. \u201cI like to say we\u2019re reclaiming.\u201d But challenging art history is less interesting to Stokes, whose primary aim is empowerment within his community. \u201cI paint for the Black grandmas of the future,\u201d he said, \u201cFor them to have something in their house. I want those Judeo-Christian images to be bootlegged, re-copied and printed. I want people to have those pictures in their homes.\u201d While public and institutional interest in Black art has been increasing steadily since 2008, attention and engagement is often inextricably linked to the news cycle. According to a report published by ArtNews and Morgan Stanley earlier this year, sales of works by African-born artists (born after 1974) jumped from $16.2 million to $40.6 million in 2021. However by 2023, the total had dropped from $52.1 million down to $17.9 million. \u201cI do think that in the art world, there was a huge reaction to 2020. So I guess the question is, where are we going from here?\u201d said Akinkugbe. \u201cIt\u2019s not that this hasn\u2019t happened before, with the Black Arts Movement in the US and the UK in the \u201880s, also with the Harlem Renaissance (in the 1920s.) We\u2019ve had these movements where there\u2019s been a peak in interest, almost like Black creators have become a trend, then it passes.\u201d Could exhibitions like \u201cThe Whole World Smiles With You\u201d ever make a dent in the pervasive white syllabus of art history? \u201cI would love for someone to see these paintings and have their gaze challenged,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it could broaden someone\u2019s idea of what Black art is. That\u2019s what I hope will happen. But in terms of changing the way art history is taught, I don\u2019t know.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/style/black-figurative-art-london-exhibition/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_weather_california-heat-dome-west-climate", "text": "A brutal heat dome is ramping up and sending temperatures to dangerous levels in California and the West in what is the region\u2019s first significant heat wave of the year. And heat hasn\u2019t peaked yet. July-like high temperatures will top out at 20 to 25 degrees above normal in multiple Western states this week and could break several daily record high temperatures. Thursday will be the hottest day of the week for millions of people. The temperatures will be dangerous for those exposed to the elements and unable to cool off. Relief from the heat won\u2019t be found at night, either \u2013 another symptom of a world warming due to fossil fuel pollution. The extreme heat already turned deadly over the weekend with worse to come. Excessive heat warnings are in effect for nearly 19 million people in California, Nevada, Arizona and Utah and South Texas. The warnings are the most extreme form of heat alert issued by the National Weather Service and are used when widespread, dangerous heat is expected. The soaring temperatures are being caused by a\u00a0heat dome, a large area of high pressure that parks over an area, traps air and heats it with abundant sunshine for days or weeks. The resulting heat becomes more intense the longer a heat dome lasts. SO HOT: The planet has just lived through a \u2018shocking\u2019 12-month streak of record heat. It\u2019s set to get worse The intense heat began Tuesday in parts of California and the West. Sacramento, California, hit triple digits for the first time this year while Las Vegas ended up just a degree shy of its hottest temperature of the year so far. Numerous daily records were also broken in Texas. Temperatures will soar higher on Wednesday across a larger portion of the Southwest. The most extreme heat will avoid major population centers along the coast, but Los Angeles will still be 5 to 10 degrees warmer than normal this week. TELL US: Worried about affording air conditioning this summer? Share your story Triple-digit temperatures will become widespread in California\u2019s Central Valley Wednesday and stick around into the weekend. Conditions will also sizzle in Southern California\u2019s desert regions. Death Valley, the hottest place in the world, will likely reach a high temperature of at least 120 degrees by Thursday. Even the brutal desert landscape doesn\u2019t typically get this hot until mid-to-late June. Phoenix will likely hit 110 degrees for the first time this year by Thursday, even though the city doesn\u2019t typically encounter these temperatures until mid-June. High temperatures are forecast to climb into the low 110s in Las Vegas, likely tying this year with 2010 for the earliest such reading on record in the city. Summerlike heat will also send daily high temperature records tumbling. Phoenix; Las Vegas; Flagstaff, Arizona; Reno, Nevada; and Fresno, California, are just a handful of cities where the day\u2019s high temperature record could fall on one or more days this week. By Friday, records could be broken in parts of Oregon, Washington, Idaho and Colorado as heat expands north and east. Deadly heat on the US-Mexico border Dangerous heat isn\u2019t new for the far southern US. Brutal heat in Mexico crept north into southern Texas earlier this spring and has been unrelenting for weeks. Several cities along the Texas-Mexico border experienced their hottest May on record. The triple digit temperatures at the border proved deadly last weekend after US Border Patrol agents said four migrants died \u201cfrom heat stroke and dehydration.\u201d The deaths were part of \u201cseveral emergencies\u201d involving heat-related illnesses last weekend, according to the US Border Patrol, El Paso Sector. The sector includes portions of southeastern New Mexico and western Texas. Heat is the deadliest weather threat in the US. It kills more than twice as many people each year as hurricanes and tornadoes combined, according to the National Weather Service. High temperatures in the area were about 5 degrees above normal from last Friday through Sunday, but are likely to climb to 10 degrees above normal Thursday and Friday.

{"id": "2024_05_25_style_zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk", "text": "Above Beijing\u2019s imperial center rises Jingshan, or Prospect Hill. From a pagoda at its modest peak, a panoramic view of the city presents itself. To the south, the dull golden roofs of the Forbidden City crest and fall, pulling the eye southward to Tiananmen \u2014 the Gate of Heavenly Peace \u2014 and the vast square of the same name just beyond. To the east stand the smooth metallic skyscrapers of the city\u2019s business district. To the north, at the top of Beijing\u2019s central axis \u2014 its so-called dragon\u2019s vein \u2014 sit the Bell and Drum Towers, which once acted as the city\u2019s collective timepiece. And stretching all along the western periphery are the calm, tree-lined waters of the manmade lakes, dug by hand for the pleasure of past emperors. It\u2019s this aerial view of \u201cZhongnanhai,\u201d meaning \u201cmiddle and southern seas,\u201d and the surrounding buildings that today\u2019s Chinese leaders prefer you did not see. That\u2019s because the 1,500-acre site of repurposed imperial pavilions and temples, along with gray modern offices has formed the leadership compound for the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP)  since 1950. As the seat of power, Zhongnanhai is often thought of as China\u2019s equivalent to the White House, or the Kremlin. Synonymous with China\u2019s communist party elite, and among the country\u2019s most secretive places, it is ringed by a centuries-old red ochre wall, with countless CCTV cameras periscoping above it \u2014 and patrolled assiduously by security forces in both plain clothes and uniform. A peaceful getaway For Chinese leader Xi Jinping\u2019s imperial forebears, the site served a somewhat different function. While emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties ruled their vast kingdom from within the Forbidden City, they built temples, halls and living quarters in Zhongnanhai; less grandly ceremonial than those of the palace, they were often oriented to take advantage of the views afforded by the area\u2019s tranquil waters and carefully planned gardens. Many of these emperors came to favor passing their days surrounded by drooping willows in the cool and quiet of this cultivated pleasure garden. A story relayed by the scholar Geremie Barm\u00e9 in his book \u201cThe Forbidden City\u201d tells of the 18th-century Qianlong Emperor\u2019s daily routine at Zhongnanhai: Each morning, after a first breakfast of cold swallows nest soup, he would travel by heated palanquin to the gardens\u2019\u00a0Studio of Convivial Delight,\u00a0a pavilion he built to capitalize on the view of the South Lake, where he would breakfast again on a meal of\u00a018 dishes. As the historian and author of \u201cThe Shortest History of China,\u201d Linda Jaivin, told CNN via email: \u201cThere is something outrageous and yet poetic about the incredible coordination and effort required of a team of bearers, cooks and attendants, just so that an emperor could come, catch a view of the magnificent Ocean Terrace, scoff his food and (leave).\u201d The first ruler to view Zhongnanhai as primarily a place to govern from, not simply relax in, was the Empress Dowager Cixi, who effectively controlled China for almost five decades from 1861. She lived for many years in the gardens\u2019 Hall of Ceremonial Phoenixes, which became the center of political authority in China. She would die there in 1908. The serene surroundings of Zhongnanhai also became, under Cixi, a place of punishment and confinement. In 1898, following attempted reforms that displeased her, Cixi imprisoned her nephew, the Guangxu Emperor, on Yingtai Island, which juts out into the southern lake. Built as a miniature version of the mythical Penglai island, home to the immortals of Chinese legend, the tiny piece of land would become the emperor\u2019s home for most of his life, bar a brief period when the Boxer rebellion of 1900 forced the whole court to flee the capital. He would die on Yingtai Island from arsenic poisoning the day before the Empress Dowager herself. His imprisonment and death, said writer M. A. Aldrich, author of \u201cThe Search for a Vanishing Beijing: A Guide to China\u2019s Capital Through the Ages,\u201d perhaps adds a touch of poignancy for any subsequent resident of Zhongnanhai. \u201cIn addition to being a site that preserves sites of imperial splendor,\u201d he told CNN, \u201cit also functions as a reminder to the political elite about the consequences for stepping out of line.\u201d For Aldrich, however, the Zhongnanhai compound also represents the destructive impulses of the CCP towards its adopted capital in the years after 1949, when Mao Zedong proclaimed the foundation of the People\u2019s Republic. \u201cAs a political symbol of the New China, it has been torn up, rebuilt, expanded, and revamped so many times that its connection with its elegant past has been lost,\u201d Aldrich said. Architectural changes There have been serious revisions to the architecture of Zhongnanhai since the end of imperial rule in 1912. After the last emperor abdicated the throne, China\u2019s new president Yuan Shikai granted him the right to live on the northern section of the Forbidden City \u2014 and then took Zhongnanhai to be his new administration\u2019s headquarters. The changes he made to the imperial gardens were disparaged by many of the Westerners who visited them. \u201cWhatever may be one\u2019s opinion as to whether Yuan Shikai \u2018exalted his aim\u2019 in his political career, he certainly cannot be said to have done so as builder and architect,\u201d wrote L.C. Arlington and William Lewisohn in their 1935 book \u201cIn Search of Old Peking,\u201d \u201cfor all the buildings that have been erected or restored by him are in the worst possible taste.\u201d Most notable of these changes \u2014 at least to ordinary Beijingers \u2014 was the repurposing of a two-story pavilion at the very south of the gardens. Known as the Precious Moon Tower, it had been built decades earlier by the Qianlong Emperor for a homesick lover, a Muslim woman from Xinjiang, taken to Beijing as part of the spoils of war. The concubine would gaze south from the tower toward a mock mosque and bazaar the emperor had especially constructed to assuage her longing for home. Yuan refashioned this pavilion into the main entrance to his presidential compound, and established a tall watchtower just to its east. The gate was named Xinhuamen, or the Gate of New China. Today, the structure remains coated in the same deep red that graces the walls of all Beijing\u2019s imperial buildings, with a roof of glazed yellow tiles and detailing that runs below the roofline, picked out in blue and gold. The gate is now flanked by two red banners that speak to its modern purpose as China\u2019s political and party headquarters: \u201cLong Live the Great Communist Party of China\u201d reads one; and \u201cLong Live the Invincible Mao Zedong Thought\u201d on the other. On a screen wall recessed behind the entrance way, Chinese characters written in Mao\u2019s own calligraphic style declare: \u201cServe the People.\u201d Facing out onto Beijing\u2019s main east-west thoroughfare, the gate remains the most conspicuous part of Zhongnanhai. The rest of the compound has, since 1989, been firmly off-limits to the Chinese public. Seat of power Initially, after the communist victory in China\u2019s civil war in 1949, Mao Zedong took up residence at Shuangqing Villa in Fragrant Hills, another former imperial garden to the west of Beijing. Though wary of establishing himself in the imperial heart of Beijing \u2014 it is said that he refused ever to enter the Forbidden City, for fear of being associated with the power structures of old, feudal China he had fought to overthrow \u2014 Mao ultimately moved into Zhongnanhai and, in late 1949, he set up in the\u00a0Garden of Abundant Beneficence,\u00a0a large courtyard compound favored by both the Qianlong and Kangxi emperors, where he would hold court with dignitaries\u00a0and live\u00a0until 1966. Having re-established Zhongnanhai as a center of political power in the new China, Mao set about rebuilding the compound according to his tastes. \u201cSince 1949, an assortment of new architecture styles has encroached into Zhongnanhai, with a tennis court, gymnasium, swimming pools and Western buildings topped off with Chinese eave roofs adding a discordant note that would not have been appreciated by its traditionally-minded original owners,\u201d said Aldrich. In 1966, Mao moved from the Garden of Abundant Beneficence to a specially built house beside his beloved indoor swimming pool. He often summoned officials to speak to him as he bobbed in the water \u2014 and famously received Russian leader Nikita Khrushchev at his pool during a 1958 visit. \u201cTheir interpreters had to pace alongside the edge of the pool,\u201d said Jaivin. \u201cThe Russian couldn\u2019t swim and had to wear water wings. Mao loved both swimming and putting Khrushchev in his place. Finally, Khrushchev got sick of it, and clambered out to sit on the edge, dangling his feet in the water.\u201d In the residence next door, Mao lined his rooms with bookshelves housing an extensive library of Chinese classical literature. \u201cIt was here,\u201d noted Aldrich, \u201cwith the background trappings of a scholar, that he met Nixon and Kissinger in 1972.\u201d Most subsequent leaders have preferred to keep a house outside the Zhongnanhai compound. Deng Xiaoping lived, from 1977, in a courtyard house on a nearby lane adjacent to Beihai, the \u201cNorthern Sea\u201d of central Beijing\u2019s chain of lakes. While not officially disclosed, it is believed that more contemporary leaders, including Xi Jinping and his predecessors Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, have maintained homes in an exclusive gated compound in Jade Spring Hill, sometimes called the \u201cback garden\u201d of Chinese politics, out to the city\u2019s west. Aldrich noted that those leaders and party cadres who used Zhongnanhai as their primary residence often attracted unwelcome scrutiny for their activities, particularly during years of political turbulence. \u201cIn his memoirs, Chairman Mao\u2019s physician, Li Zhisui, commented that (the complex\u2019s) residents were always under surveillance,\u201d Aldrich said. \u201cDuring the Cultural Revolution, the simple act of making a fire would bring down the wrath of the security guards on the perpetrator. It was believed that such a fire was proof that incriminating or seditious materials were being destroyed.\u201d The imperial gardens offering vistas of Zhongnanhai\u2019s lakes have, today, been filled in with dozens of gray offices and meeting halls, many of which date to 1970s, when Zhongnanhai underwent significant razing and renovation \u2014 the rebuilding was so extensive that one visitor in 1979 described the grounds resembling a construction site, with muddy roads that were impossible to walk on. The contemporary compound splits roughly in two, with the northern buildings, on the banks of the \u201cmiddle lake,\u201d used as the headquarters of China\u2019s top executive body, the State Council. It is here that foreign dignitaries are admitted. Around the \u201csouthern lake,\u201d meanwhile, are the headquarters of the CCP, including, within Qinzheng Hall (the Hall of Diligent Government), the offices of the general secretary of the party (a post currently held by Xi). Many of the most historically significant political events to occur at Zhongnanhai have taken place in Huairen Hall, or the Hall of Cherished Compassion, on the western side of the Middle Lake. The hall was added to the imperial park during the late Qing dynasty, but was then extensively remodeled by the CCP in the early 1950s to impart a more august socialist grandeur. It is a broad, imposing ceremonial hall with staggered roofs of glazed green tiles falling in curved lines to upturned corners; the facade of austere grey brick is interrupted by red wooden pillars, windows and doors. The building\u2019s capacious interior houses a large auditorium, as well as numerous smaller meeting rooms. The hall has, for decades, served as the main meeting place for China\u2019s Politburo, the party\u2019s decision-making body usually comprising about two dozen members. On occasion, it has also hosted the Politburo\u2019s Standing Committee, the core of China\u2019s political elite, (the power of both bodies has notably dwindled in the era of Xi), though they most commonly meet in Qinzheng Hall, close to the general secretary\u2019s office. During the tumult of the Cultural Revolution vital discussions and debates occurred at Huairen Hall, and, in the months after its conclusion, it was there that three of the so-called Gang of Four \u2014 the political faction that included Mao\u2019s wife held responsible for the worst excesses of the era \u2014 were arrested, tricked into attending a meeting they thought was about the publication of the fifth volume of Mao\u2019s Selected Works. In April 1989, former party head Hu Yaobang suffered a heart-attack during a Politburo meeting at Huairen; his death a week later would trigger the Tiananmen Square protests that the government forcibly cracked down on in early June of that year. However, the compound hasn\u2019t always been so forbidden for the masses following the collapse of China\u2019s imperial dynasty. In the late 1920s, it became a park, with tourists allowed to boat on and swim in the lakes, while in the 1980s, the public could access some of its scenic and historical spots, including\u00a0Mao\u2019s\u00a0former residence, on\u00a0organized weekend tours.\u00a0Even early in 1989, a journalist for the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0was able to casually\u00a0drive\u00a0a senior official into the compound and drop him off inside.\u00a0During a period of warmer US and China relations in 2011, former Chinese president\u00a0Hu Jintao\u00a0invited\u00a0a group of American high school students to Zhongnanhai. Modern security concerns Today, Zhongnanhai is more closely-guarded than ever, though the inexorable development of the city has caused problems in maintaining the compound\u2019s secrecy. When an annex to the nearby Beijing Hotel was built in\u00a01973, authorities were panicked by the realization that from its upper floors one could quite easily see \u2013 and potentially target a sniper rifle \u2013 into Zhongnanhai. A building was hastily erected on the western edge of the Forbidden City to restrict this view. Likewise in 2018, when Beijing\u2019s new tallest building was\u00a0completed\u00a0\u2013 the 528-meter Citic tower, better known as the \u201cZun\u201d \u2013 the country\u2019s national security apparatus reportedly requisitioned the top floors amid fears that visitors or occupants might be able to spy into the compound. Beijing authorities did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on the security situation at the time. Zhongnanhai\u2019s entrance, Xinhuamen, has also been the site of repeated demonstrations in recent decades; in 1989, it was a gathering point for students taking part in the Tiananmen protests, whilst in 1999, more than 10,000 members of the since-banned Falun Gong gathered on the sidewalks near Zhongnanhai to protest their treatment at the hands of the government. So, while Zhongnanhai is sometimes compared to the White House, Aldrich argues that the paranoia with which the compound is today guarded makes it more like the imperial palace of centuries past: \u201cSince ordinary people are not allowed to enter Zhongnanhai, it is probably more appropriate to describe it as a \u2018New Forbidden City\u2019 for China\u2019s ruling elite rather than a place with a personal political resonance for the average citizen,\u201d he said. \u201cHeck, even the Kremlin is open to tourists!\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/style/zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_style_india-madras-fabric-us-fashion-intl-hnk", "text": "On the cover of Lisa Birnbach\u2019s \u201cThe Official Preppy Handbook,\u201d a tongue-in-cheek 1980s guide to looking, acting and thinking like a US prep school elite, a pattern along the border depicts a fabric that has become synonymous with casual American luxury: madras. The colorful plaid cotton cloth has been used by brands like Ralph Lauren and Brooks Brothers for decades. Think light summer dresses, shirts and shorts worn at the country club or on sailing holidays in the Bahamas \u2014 the kind of attire that might be complemented by a pair of leather boat shoes. But this staple of preppy American fashion has humble origins, far from Martha\u2019s Vineyard or the hallways of Yale or Harvard, in Chennai, India, the coastal city from which it takes its name. (Chennai was known as Madras during British rule.) Originally worn by Indian laborers, the cloth almost sparked a corporate scandal for American textile importer William Jacobson in 1958 due to its tendency to bleed when cleaned with strong detergent in high-powered washing machines. \u201cThe fascinating thing was that with every wash, the colors bled into each other. And they didn\u2019t do it badly. They bled in a very \u2018design\u2019 kind of way,\u201d said Bachi Karkaria, author of \u201cCapture the Dream: The Many Lives of Captain C.P. Krishnan Nair,\u201d a biography of the Indian textile magnate and hotelier who first sold Jacobson the madras, in a video interview with CNN. \u201cThis is what absolutely attracted Jacobson.\u201d In her book, Karkaria tells the story of Jacobson and Nair\u2019s meeting \u2014 Nair rattling off the unique selling points of the fabric, which was woven using lightweight 60-count yarn for the warp (thread held in place on the loom) and slightly heavier 40-count yarn for the weft (thread woven horizontally through the warp) before being dyed. The natural dyes were made from laterites, indigo blue, turmeric and local sesame seed oil, all of which gave the cloth a distinctive scent. Madras was, by the 1950s, already a hit in West Africa where it was used to make flamboyant gowns for weddings and other celebrations. A unique selling point But the most exciting quality Nair pitched to Jacobson, Karkaria said, was the fabric\u2019s weakness-as-strength \u2014 it would bleed with every wash, creating a new kind of check and a \u201cnew\u201d garment. The pair struck a dollar-a-yard deal (about $10 per yard in today\u2019s money), with an immediate shipment of 10,000 yards that was entirely scooped up by Brooks Brothers and tailored into sporty jackets, shirts and shorts. \u201cLaidback post\u2013World War II baby boomers couldn\u2019t have enough,\u2019\u201d she wrote, noting that shelves with madras clothing were stripped within a week. But, in his excitement, Jacobson forgot to tell Brooks Brothers the fabric would bleed, the author said. When the label failed to provide buyers with proper care instructions, complaints and lawsuits started rolling in. \u201cAll hell broke loose because customers found that their colors would \u2018bleed\u2019 not only into the fabric\u2019s own checks but also run into the other clothes which were unwittingly washed along with them,\u201d wrote Karkaria. One of New York\u2019s original \u201cMad Men\u201d was called in to salvage the situation \u2014 British advertising tycoon David Ogilvy, who ended up coining the tagline \u201cGuaranteed to Bleed,\u201d spinning the apparent flaw into a unique selling point. The publicity drive continued with an eight-page advertorial in Seventeen magazine on the \u201cmiracle handwoven fabric from India,\u201d featuring an interview with Nair. \u201cNaturally, all the other pr\u00eat labels cottoned on, and made it part of their summer collections,\u201d wrote Karkaria. From the brink of a PR disaster, Ogilvy had helped turn madras garments into must-haves for America\u2019s well-heeled jet-set. Yale links and the making of an icon Although Ogilvy, Nair and Jacobson shot madras into superstardom in the US during the 1960s, the fabric\u2019s link with the Ivy League had started centuries earlier with Elihu Yale, the colonial administrator of the East India Company\u2019s Fort St. George outpost in Chennai and the primary benefactor of Yale College (now Yale University). A 1961 advertisement, created by Ogilvy for the American men\u2019s shirt brand Hathaway, claims that the university was founded thanks to \u201cthree trunks of India Madras\u201d donated by Yale. Yale, who amassed much of his fortune through the East India Company in the late 17th century, sent \u201cunusual cotton fabrics that the Indian cottagers made\u201d to be sold or \u201cotherwise improved\u201d to benefit the college, the ad reads. \u201cThe handsome stuff brought enough money to finish the buildings for the new college, which grateful trustees promptly named after Eli Yale,\u201d continues the ad, which may have employed some creative license, given it\u00a0says it chose its name after Yale donated \u201cthe proceeds from the sale of nine bales of goods together with 417 books and a portrait of King George I.\u201d Yale himself is a controversial figure. He built his fortune off the exploitative diamond and textile trades, and while his namesake university says there is \u201cno direct evidence\u201d that he \u201cpersonally owned slaves,\u201d he stands accused of trading and profiting from them. But Yale\u2019s fabric donation wasn\u2019t the only reason why madras became synonymous with American prep. The fabric already had a long history by the time Yale chanced upon it. Some say it was inspired by Scottish tartans, though it differs in several important ways (madras features neither the black lines nor the two-by-two weave of tartan, and is made of cotton, not wool). Records seen by Metropolitan Museum of Art researcher Kai Toussaint Marcel show that Portuguese merchants traded the Indian fabric in North Africa and the Middle East as far back as the 13th century, and that the Kalabari people of Nigeria used it in dresses and headdresses and during religious and spiritual rituals. Marcel, writing for the Tommy Hillfiger-backed \u201cFashion and Race Database, a project founded by Parsons School of Design professor Kimberly M. Jenkins, added that West African slaves brought to America likely kept these traditions, and the fabric, alive. From Chennai to shores of the Caribbean Fort St. George was established in the 1630s, helping the British cement a monopoly on the highly lucrative Indian textile industry. Later, the Dutch and French would also trade cotton and madras alongside enslaved Africans, bringing the fabric aboard slave ships to the West Indies. In the 18th century, a protectionist move to support domestic textile producers saw England and France ban madras from being sold in their countries, only allowing it to be traded in the Caribbean colonies. Research by the London School of Economics estimates that Indian cotton textiles, which were often exchanged for slaves, accounted for 30% of the total export value of 18th century Anglo-African trade. From there, madras \u201cbecame a staple for both free and enslaved Black people,\u201d especially women, who \u201cused brightly-colored madras headdresses to subvert the sumptuary laws (that limited private expenditure on food and personal items) of the Caribbean and New Orleans\u2026 which mandated plainness as a sign of inferiority,\u201d writes Marcel. And it was there, on the sunny shores of the Caribbean, that the cloth became an inseparable part of the prep wardrobe thanks to tourism and Ivy League rugby tournaments in the mid-1930s. Students from East Coast schools like Yale and Princeton would travel to Bermuda to play rugby and \u201csunbathe, splash in the surf, play in volleyball tournaments and elect a new Miss College Week,\u201d Sports Illustrated reported in 1956. They would also \u201cthrong\u201d local stores to \u201cbuy devalued-pound bargains in cashmere and Shetland sweaters, madras Bermuda shorts and blazers,\u201d the article added. As a result, Marcel wrote, madras became \u201cassociated with Ivy League schools, vacation, the Caribbean, and eventually domestic locales such as Long Island (the Hamptons), Rhode Island (Newport), and South Florida (Palm Beach and Fisher Island). \u201cThe fabric was fashioned into everything from shirts, (pants), shorts, and blazers, to watchbands, ties, and other accessories.\u201d Nowadays the fabric is a little less ubiquitous, with the \u201cquiet luxury\u201d trend nudging brands toward a more toned-down aesthetic. And even the cover of Birnbach\u2019s updated guide to the preppy lifestyle, \u201cTrue Prep: It\u2019s a Whole New Old World,\u201d has replaced its madras border with another \u2014 though no less colorful \u2014 pattern: stripes.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/style/india-madras-fabric-us-fashion-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_africa_jacob-zuma-comeback-south-africa-elections-intl", "text": "South Africa\u2019s African National Congress (ANC) party faces a mammoth challenge as it needs to form a government with its political rivals after suffering a seismic blow in last week\u2019s election. On Wednesday, the ANC\u2019s national spokesperson insisted that any coalition government would be in the interests of unity and stability and hinted at a government of national unity of some kind. \u201cThe ANC has taken the position that we must all act in the interest of our country and its people, and work on a national consensus on the form of government that is best suited to move South Africa forward at this moment in our history,\u201d Mahlengi Bhengu-Motsiri told a press briefing. Still, some of the same parties that sought the ANC\u2019s demise will now have to play a part in governing South Africa. For decades, the ANC could rule alone, but support for the the party plummeted to around 40% in last Wednesday\u2019s elections, down from 57% in 2019. Analysts and opinion polls had forecast losses for the ANC but a pivotal factor in the party\u2019s staggering decline was former President Jacob Zuma and his newly formed uMkhonto weSizwe (MK) party, which capitalized on widespread discontent within the ANC\u2019s traditional voter base. Zuma\u2019s revenge Zuma \u2013 a fierce critic of current ANC leader and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa \u2013 was forced to resign as president in 2018 and has been looking for political revenge ever since. His MK party, named after the ANC\u2019s former armed wing, appears to have achieved just that \u2013 formed just five months ago, it is now the third-largest party in South Africa, receiving almost 15% of the vote. Zuma positioned MK as \u201ca party that is meant to restore the ANC to its former glory,\u201d said political analyst Tessa Dooms, programmes director at the Rivonia Circle non-profit organization/political think tank in Johannesburg. She says many MK voters saw this ballot as a protest vote. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen with the MK party is the use of a vote to send a signal to the ANC of the level of unhappiness, not only of the country itself but within its ranks who\u2019ve supported it over the last 30 years,\u201d Dooms told CNN. Despite Zuma being barred from running for parliament by the Constitutional Court because of a previous contempt of court violation, the 82-year-old\u2019s\u00a0face remained on the ballot paper. Zuma is no stranger to controversy or the courtroom. He\u202fhas faced\u202fhundreds of corruption, fraud and racketeering charges\u202fover the years. He has always denied all of them and became known as the \u201cTeflon President\u201d because few politicians could have survived the scandals he weathered. Ramaphosa replaced him as president when Zuma was finally forced to resign. Later revelations of \u201cstate capture\u201d \u2013 or rampant corruption riveted the nation in an anti-corruption commission. Much of the focus was on Zuma\u2019s relationship with the influential and wealthy Gupta brothers. With the ANC\u2019s popularity now at an all-time low and as Ramaphosa\u2019s political future hangs in the balance, Zuma could have the last laugh. But it is too early to tell. Due to the poor election showing, South Africa\u2019s political landscape has been fundamentally altered, leaving the ANC with the daunting task of forming a coalition government. In many countries, coalition talks can take months, but South Africa\u2019s constitution gives rival parties a short window to do something they have never really done before: come together. According to the constitution, rival parties have a mere 14 days to create a coalition after the final election results are announced. The outcome of these talks will likely\u00a0determine Ramaphosa\u2019s future as president. Ramaphosa\u2019s\u00a0allies\u00a0in the party are digging in. On Sunday, ANC Secretary-General Fikile Mbalula warned potential coalition partners that the president\u2019s resignation is \u201cnot going to happen.\u201d \u201cI think the ANC has many factors to consider in terms of how it forms a government \u2013 both the stability of the country at large but also for the sake of having a government that still holds to the values of the ANC that it has long said that it serves,\u201d Dooms told CNN. The potential coalition partners present starkly different political ideologies and policy priorities. A marriage of convenience First, there is the official opposition Democratic Alliance (DA), a broadly centrist and pro-business party that has heavily criticized the ANC for many years. Led by John Steenhuisen, it is seen by many\u00a0as a party for White South Africans, something the DA rejects. Steenhuisen has not ruled out going into a coalition with the ANC. A DA-ANC alliance, however it would form, would likely keep Ramaphosa in his job, say analysts. \u201cThe only way Ramaphosa stays is through a DA-ANC coalition.\u00a0Outside that,\u00a0the other parties, MK and EFF\u00a0(Economic Freedom Fighters), have made it clear the first point of negotiation is he must go,\u201d said TK Pooe, a senior lecturer at Wits School of Governance. If the ANC were to pair with the DA, which\u202freceived 21.8% of the vote, their combined support would amount to more than 60%, an outright majority. However, this relationship would require both parties to make some major compromises. While in government, the ANC\u2019s flagship policy for driving economic inclusion and racial equality in post-apartheid South Africa has been its Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment policy, known as triple-BEE or simply BEE. The\u202fBEE policy has been criticized\u202fby some as neither broad-based, nor empowering. In contrast, the DA has\u202fsaid\u202fit would replace BEE with an \u201cEconomic Justice Policy\u201d that \u201ctargets the poor black majority for redress, rather than a small, connected elite.\u201d The DA is also against the ANC\u2019s flagship National Health Insurance Act (NIH) in its current form. The act, which was signed into law two weeks before the election, seeks to provide universal health care for all and gradually limit the role of private health insurers. However, both parties believe in the primacy of South Africa\u2019s constitution and both have promised to crack down on corruption. Awkwardly, the DA is currently\u202fpressing corruption charges\u202fagainst the ANC\u2019s deputy president,\u00a0Paul Mashatile. In a move to appease internal critics, the ANC-DA coalition could be expanded to include smaller parties, or the ANC could form a minority government with a \u201cconfidence-and-supply\u201d agreement with opposition partners like the DA and the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), where they remain outside of government but support it on key votes in exchange for policy concessions. A bitter pill to swallow? If the ANC decides\u00a0to pursue coalition talks with MK, then Zuma will want Ramaphosa out, solidifying his revenge. However, if South Africa\u2019s president maintains his grip on the ANC, a coalition with MK is unlikely. The MK party\u2019s manifesto also\u00a0demands an overhaul of the country\u2019s constitution to restore more powers to traditional leaders. Zuma \u201cunapologetically focused his campaign around Zulu nationalism and that was a constituency that was easy for him to target,\u201d\u202fpolitical\u00a0analyst and former ANC\u00a0lawmaker\u00a0Melanie Verwoerd told CNN. By appealing to his Zulu base, Zuma\u2019s party has also stirred ethnic and tribal tensions, a strategy that, while electorally effective, risks deepening divisions in South Africa, Verwoerd added. The ANC\u2019s policies, grounded in the principles of non-racial and non-tribal governance, are at odds with this approach. It is also currently unclear how much MK actually wants to govern. Despite doing well at the polls, the party has demanded a re-run, threatened court action, and suggested boycotting the first sitting of Parliament. However,\u00a0it has provided no evidence of\u00a0voting\u00a0irregularities. The other option for a coalition is the EFF,\u00a0led by former ANC youth leader Julius Malema, who was expelled from the party more than a decade ago. The breakaway party espouses land expropriation without compensation and sweeping state nationalism, including nationalizing the Reserve Bank. Malema has said\u202fhe would give the EFF vote to the ANC on the condition that his deputy, Floyd Shivambu, becomes Minister of Finance in an effort to control fiscal policy. South Africa\u2019s business community and middle class are broadly nervous about an EFF\u2013ANC coalition and its effect on investor confidence. The DA calls it part of a\u00a0\u201cdoomsday\u201d option because of the potential impact on investment and trade. The EFF won just under 10% of the vote, so any coalition with the ANC would need to include at least another party in the mix to give it a healthy majority. The IFP, with almost 4% of the vote, could be such a kingmaker. Aside from a classic coalition deal or a \u201cconfidence and supply\u201d agreement, another hypothetical option on the table would be a \u201cgovernment of national unity\u201d (GNU), bringing in all the major parties. This scenario would hark back to the post-apartheid era when South Africa operated under a GNU to oversee the new constitution,\u00a0led by Mandela as president and FW de Klerk and Thabo Mbeki as deputy presidents,\u00a0between April 1994 and February 1997. With less than two weeks\u00a0to finalize coalition agreements, South Africa\u2019s political future remains uncertain; the ANC must navigate this complex landscape to form a stable government and address the challenges that have led to its diminished support, while Ramaphosa\u2019s leadership hangs in the balance amidst Zuma\u2019s dramatic comeback.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/africa/jacob-zuma-comeback-south-africa-elections-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_02_europe_d-day-80th-anniversary-commemoration-preview-intl", "text": "At 99 years old, Jack Foy is considered the youngster among his group of friends that fought in World War II. But their advanced age isn\u2019t going to stop them from making the transatlantic journey to honor their fallen comrades on the 80th anniversary of D-Day. On June 6, Foy \u2013 a survivor of the Battle of the Bulge \u2013 and his fellow American veterans will join dignitaries and heads of state from around the world to commemorate the approximately 160,000 Allied troops who, eight decades ago, carried out the largest seaborne invasion in human history. Foy told CNN that he has been to several memorials in France since 2014. The emotional resonance of each trip grows stronger year after year, he said, because these veterans know each trip could be their last. \u201cWe realize we\u2019re getting to the end of our time,\u201d Foy said. They are not alone. With major commemorations held every five years, organizers and government officials concede that this year\u2019s event could be the last to involve living veterans, whose stories of the horrors of war have become particularly poignant given that Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has brought a large-scale ground war back to Europe for the first time since 1945. \u201cWe are perfectly aware that for these centenarians, this is maybe the last chance to return to the beaches where they landed, where they fought and where their brothers-in-arms fell,\u201d said Gen. Michel Delion, the CEO of the French government agency in charge of the French commemoration efforts, Mission Liberation. The various countries putting together the event are now planning what is expected to be the most extensive D-Day commemoration in history \u2013 both in terms of size and, crucially for elderly veterans, logistics. Approximately 150 American veterans are expected to travel to Normandy \u2013 about two dozen of whom actually fought on D-Day \u2013 said Charles Djou, the secretary of the American Battle Monuments Commission (ABMC), the independent agency responsible for managing US military cemeteries and monuments overseas. The youngest is 96. Fifteen Canadian veterans, including three or four that fought on D-Day, are traveling with the Canadian delegation, according to John Desrosiers, the director of international operations for Veterans Affairs Canada. Desrosiers said the youngest traveling with the group is 98 and the eldest are 104. The British defense ministry said it expects more than 40 WWII veterans at the various events in Normandy. Those vets will be joined by about 25 heads of state and government, including US President Joe Biden, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Russian President Vladimir Putin was not extended an invitation due to the war in Ukraine, while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is planning on attending, according to a French presidential source. With so many heads of state in town, the security measures in place are intense. A massive contingent of 12,000 security personnel will be deployed on June 6, the French Interior Ministry said. Heavy travel restrictions put in place by French authorities will also effectively cut off the Norman coastline and the normally sleepy towns that dot it from the rest of the country. Yet June 6 typically sees these elderly men criss-cross the region to hit a full day\u2019s itinerary, including national ceremonies held at the American, British and Canadian cemeteries; the big international commemoration put on by France; and then, if they have the energy, more local events. Most veterans also travel with an entire phalanx of medical personnel. The charity that organized Foy\u2019s trip, the US-based Best Defense Foundation, is bringing three doctors and 10 nurses to accompany the 50 veterans they are flying over from the United States. Each veteran will travel with a personal caregiver \u2013 typically a family member or a friend. Officials say they are going to incredible lengths to treat veterans like royalty \u2013 as they are feted by actual royals. King Charles III will be there on June 6 \u2013 his first overseas trip since being diagnosed with cancer \u2013 alongside Queen Camilla and Prince William, Buckingham Palace said. Representatives from the royal families of Belgium, Monaco, the Netherlands and Norway are also expected to attend. Delion\u2019s team has been holding rehearsals and timing wheelchair runs for the French-led international ceremony. They are also considering having veterans enter at the same time as heads of states and other dignitaries to reduce their waiting time. American and Canadian organizers told CNN that they will seat veterans last at their respective national ceremonies to keep them comfortable. The general public at the American event, for example, may need to be seated about an hour in advance due to security precautions. \u201cWe take care of the veterans who served and made the enormous sacrifices that they did in the Second World War,\u201d said Djou. Keeping the stories alive After being postponed 24 hours due to bad weather, D-Day began shortly after midnight on June 6, 1944, when paratroopers dropped into German-occupied France to lay the groundwork for the incoming invasion. Allied planes and warships began their bombardment at about 6:30 a.m., with troops hitting the beaches shortly after. They landed on a stretch of coastline 50 miles long organized into five beaches codenamed Gold, Juno, Omaha, Sword and Utah. The Americans were responsible for Omaha and Utah. The British led the assault on Gold and Sword, while the Canadians handled Juno. Though 4,414 Allied troops died that day and it would take more than a month to achieve one of D-Day\u2019s main objectives \u2013 liberating the strategically important city of Caen \u2013 the landings were considered a success. Allied troops had successfully made it onshore in France; it was the beginning of the end for Hitler and Nazi Germany. The sheer drama of the event has, for decades, captured the American public imagination, because of both the magnitude of the invasion and the fact that it was a \u201cdigestible\u201d turning point in the war, according to Ben Brands, a military historian at the ABMC. \u201cWorld War II, especially in Europe, becomes this ongoing battle from basically the moment troops land on the beaches of D-Day until Germany ultimately surrenders. The human mind needs to cut that up into digestible stories, and D-Day is a really powerful, discrete event that is so critical for everything that comes after,\u201d Brands said. \u201cThere\u2019s just so many powerful stories that come out of D-Day.\u201d As time has passed, veterans have played a crucial role in passing down the stories of D-Day. Their gripping, visceral first-hand accounts are better teachers of history than any textbook. But just a fraction of the soldiers who lived through D-Day are still alive. Of the 16.4 million Americans who served in the military during WWII, fewer than 100,000 are expected to still be alive by the end of the year, according to statistics from the US Department of Veterans Affairs. In Canada, there were just 9,297 living Canadian veterans who had served in either WWII or the Korean War as of March 31, 2023, according to the most recent statistics available from Veterans Affairs Canada. The British defense ministry said it does not keep veteran numbers on hand. It\u2019s unclear what the average age of a WWII veteran is. Given that the median age for an American WWII veteran in June 2020 was 93, according to US Census figures at the time, most surviving vets from Allied forces are likely to now be at least in their late-nineties. By the 85th anniversary in 2029, those who are still living will almost certainly be in triple digits. \u201cPeople are realizing this generation is passing and they\u2019re passing rapidly now, and it\u2019s important to keep their stories alive, to keep the memories of those who died and are buried at Normandy, but also those who fought and survived because they can no longer be with us for that much longer to tell these stories,\u201d Brands said. \u201cThe 80th will be a very powerful event.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/02/europe/d-day-80th-anniversary-commemoration-preview-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_03_africa_burkina-faso-most-neglected-crisis-intl", "text": "Burkina Faso has been named the world\u2019s most neglected displacement crisis by the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) for the second year. In its\u00a0annual report, released Monday, the NRC said the West African country saw a record-high 707,000 new displacements in 2023, driven by escalating violence and a worsening humanitarian crisis. Nine out of the 10 most neglected crises outlined in the report were in Africa, with Cameroon, Central African Republic, Mali, and Niger holding the second to fifth positions respectively. The NRC said in a\u00a0press release Monday\u00a0its criteria for neglected displacement crises are: \u201clack of humanitarian funding, lack of media attention, and a lack of international political and diplomatic initiatives compared to the number of people in need.\u201d The NCR report said 2023 saw a record-breaking shortfall in aid budgets of around $32 billion, leaving more than half of humanitarian needs worldwide unmet. Neglect now \u2018the new normal\u2019 The report said media coverage of the displacement crisis in Burkina Faso and international political engagement with the crisis were \u201cnegligible\u201d in 2023, adding that only 37% of requested humanitarian funding had been received by the country, leaving a significant gap in aid. \u201cThe utter neglect of displaced people has become the new normal,\u201d said Jan Egeland, Secretary General of NRC. \u201cThe local political and military elites disregard the suffering they cause, and the world is neither shocked nor compelled to act by stories of desperation and record-breaking statistics. We need a global reboot of solidarity and a refocus on where needs are greatest.\u201d The report added that media coverage in Burkina Faso also declined as \u201caccess became more difficult for both journalists and humanitarian organisations.\u201d Burkina Faso is currently under military rule after a junta staged a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in July 2022. Its junta, headed by acting president Captain Ibrahim Traore, has prioritized security due to the multiple lives claimed by attacks. But in April this year, a Human Rights Watch\u00a0(HRW) report found\u00a0that more than 200 people were killed by the country\u2019s military in a campaign against civilians accused of collaborating with armed groups, alleging these could amount to war crimes. Burkina Faso said it \u201cfirmly rejects and condemns such unfounded accusations,\u201d in a\u00a0government press release. The country\u2019s\u00a0media regulatory body, the Superior Council for Communication, announced in the following days it was temporarily suspending broadcasting and access to websites of some western news organizations including the French\u00a0TV5 Monde and Le Monde, the Guardian,\u00a0as well as BBC Africa and VOA. The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) remained one of the most neglected crises for the eighth consecutive year, with around 6.9 million people displaced by the end of 2023, mainly in the eastern provinces, the report said. A lack of aid forced people to resort to negative coping mechanisms, including exchanging sexual favors for food, money, and other survival needs, the report stated. Sudan came in at number ten. Although the war which broke out in April last year has resulted in a death toll in the tens of thousands, more than eight million people internally displaced and nearly 25 million people in need of aid, the NRC remarked the crisis has been \u201cgrossly neglected.\u201d Recurrent attacks Violence-related deaths in Burkina Faso doubled in 2023, according to the NRC. The country faces recurrent attacks often blamed on \u201cterrorists.\u201d In February last year, the murder of two Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) aid workers led the organization to suspend activities in the region. By the end of the year, up to two million people were trapped in 36 blockaded towns, with over 40,000 facing catastrophic food insecurity, according to the report. A displaced mother in northern Burkina Faso, Asseta, shared her struggle with NRC researchers: \u201cWhen we have nothing to cook, I pick leaves and boil them in water,\u201d she said, as quoted in the organization\u2019s release. Egeland emphasized the growing difficulty in reaching those in need due to dangerous roads and the prohibitively expensive minimal air services. \u201cDonors and humanitarians must prioritize areas that are out-of-sight to ensure they do not become out-of-mind,\u201d he urged. The NRC says around 6.3 million people will need humanitarian assistance in 2024, with over two million remaining internally displaced. Hundreds of civilians have already been killed in attacks this year, including around 170 in three villages in March, and approximately 30 in separate mosque and church attacks in February. The NRC\u2019s report noted that many neglected crises are interconnected, with ripple effects beyond borders affecting neighboring countries and sometimes causing broader regional impacts. Competition over resources between refugees and local communities, driven by a lack of funds, can also cause tension.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/africa/burkina-faso-most-neglected-crisis-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "world"}}

Contract opportunities published the same day also advertise opportunities for vendors to provide \u201csundry items\u201d\u2014shampoo, toothbrushes, lotions, and other items\u2014and bedding for 1,300 people in Haiti. As conditions for the mission come together, US security contractors are already on the ground in Haiti, about 150 people as of now, a source familiar with the operation told CNN. A posting on the same website also shows that the\u00a0DOD awarded a $30 million contract to GardaWorld Federal Services LLC for private security and protection\u00a0services in Haiti for contractors preparing the\u00a0mission\u00a0base. GardaWorld, a Canadian company which\u00a0provides logistical, medical, and security services to government and commercial clients, told CNN\u00a0that they were contracted to provide these services at the housing site. The firm has previously been involved with protecting US diplomatic facilities in Afghanistan\u2014a role that is the subject of ongoing litigation initially brought by a former employee, Justin Fahn, who alleges in a whistleblower lawsuit\u00a0the company misled the US about its\u00a0employees\u2019 training. GardaWorld denies these claims in court records, and a spokesperson for the company\u00a0told CNN that it is employing \u201chighly trained security professionals\u201d to guard the facility in Haiti. \u201cBeyond the contract information made publicly available in the\u00a0sam.gov\u00a0platform, we would not have additional details to provide at this time,\u201d a Pentagon spokesperson said when reached for comment by CNN. A long-delayed mission Gang violence has wreaked havoc in Haiti, stifling civilians\u2019 access to food, water, and fuel. Armed groups control large swathes\u00a0of Haiti\u2019s capital city and forced the international airport in Port au Prince to shut down; after nearly three months, commercial flights resumed in mid-May. The MSS base is expected to be located close to Toussaint Louverture International Airport in capital city Port-au-Prince.\u00a0Satellite imagery captured on May 20 by\u00a0Maxar Technologies, obtained by CNN, shows a significant construction close to the\u00a0airport\u00a0since\u00a0mid-May.\u00a0The\u00a0expansion appears to include at least\u00a0five new structures and newly cleared land at the eastern end of the tarmac. US President Joe Biden\u00a0has said that he is working with Congress to provide $300 million for the mission and an additional $60 million for equipment to the country. \u201cThere\u2019s\u00a0going to be US\u00a0forces not on the ground, but we\u2019re going to supply logistics, intelligence, and equipment. Matter of fact, some equipment has already arrived,\u201d Biden said last week during a joint press conference with Kenyan\u00a0President William Ruto. In response to a question later in the briefing, Biden also sought to explain why the US isn\u2019t putting boots on the ground. \u201cFor the United States to deploy forces in the hemisphere just raises all kinds of questions that can be easily misrepresented about what we\u2019re trying to do\u2026 we want to do everything we can without once again looking like America is stepping over, deciding this is what must be done,\u201d Biden said. According to documents seen by CNN, the mission will be helmed by a Kenyan police commissioner and a Jamaican police lieutenant, with other top posts filled by Kenyan staff. The Bahamas, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belize, Benin, Chad, and Jamaica have also promised to contribute personnel to the mission. May 23 was the informal deadline for a contingent to be on the ground, but the initial deployment was delayed last week after a Kenyan delegation assessed that equipment on the ground was insufficient, according to sources in Haiti and DC. Sources said a primary concern for the Kenyan assessors \u2013 including several high-ranking police commanders \u2013 was whether there would be helicopters at the ready for medical evacuation. The MSS was authorized last year\u00a0by the United Nations Security Council\u00a0to\u00a0assist Haitian National Police in fighting gang violence and provide stability in the Caribbean country, following a request for military intervention by its government.\u00a0Police unions and law enforcement sources in Haiti have however complained about a lack of clear planning for how they will coordinate with the foreign force. CNN has reached out to the Haitian National Police for comment on the delay of the mission and logistical preparations for Haiti.

{"id": "2024_06_05_style_julie-satow-department-stores-fifth-avenue-women", "text": "Before the nationwide influx of suburban malls and the convenience of online shopping, there was a golden age of American department stores. More than merely local shopping hubs, these ostentatious emporiums offered tea rooms, child care, beauty services and exotic animals for sale, if you could afford a pet monkey or a baby puma. Though the buildings belonged to billionaire men, it was women who strategized and oversaw the commercial and cultural success of some of the biggest and best department stores in America: Hortense Odlum at Bonwit Teller, Dorothy Shaver at Lord & Taylor and Geraldine Stutz at Henri Bendel among them. This trio are among the subjects of Julie Satow\u2019s new book, \u201cWhen Women Ran Fifth Avenue: Glamour and Power at the Dawn of American Fashion.\u201d As Satow illustrates, department stores were places where women gathered, gossiped and dreamed of more luxurious lives.\u00a0In Europe, there was Harrods (or Liberty) in London and Le Bon Marche Rive Gauche in Paris \u2014 stores that had established the culture of shopping as an event, buzzing with a life of their own. And from the Depression era through to the swinging Sixties in New York, Odlum, Shaver and Stutz built their domains into similar fashion and cultural destinations. Satow knits their stories together to explore how the evolution of department stores reflected the changing values of women as business leaders, how closely our identities are tied to where we shop (and what we buy) and how the role of humans is integral to the experience of shopping \u2014 or, perhaps, any service industry threatened by automatization. \u201cWhen department stores originally opened, (they represented) one of the rare opportunities for women to congregate together in public,\u201d\u00a0Satow told CNN. \u201cIt was almost a fantasy world, and a place for women to come together for advice and a sense of community. Shopping was a sentient, sensual experience.\u201d Even for those on the other side of the counter, it was momentous: Employment gave many women their first taste of independence, and aspirations to careers in retail, fashion and hospitality. And the stores also offered something much greater to the women Satow profiles. In a period in which it was nearly impossible for women to pursue business leadership, independently or at all, Odlum, Shaver and Stutz were largely unsung pioneers. \u201cNone of these women have biographies,\u201d Satow noted. \u201cDorothy Shaver paved the way for many other women who rose through the ranks in the retail industry. She broke so many ceilings in terms of women at work\u2026 In 1947, she was named \u2018the No. 1 career woman\u2019 in TIME magazine, which was a rarity.\u201d That year, Shaver was overseeing a $40 million business, and by the time she died in 1959 \u2014 still president of Lord & Taylor to the end \u2014 annual sales had reached $100 million. Shaver was also a founding member of the organization of women within the American fashion\u00a0industry, Fashion Group (now known as the Fashion Group International) alongside\u00a0Elizabeth Arden\u00a0and\u00a0Helena Rubinstein in 1930, and the architect of the \u201cAmerican Look,\u201d which in the 1940s transformed the national fashion industry and instilled a sense of pride in less restrictive, affordable American clothing, the forerunner of modern sportswear. Until that point, American women had become accustomed to buying European fashion or cheaper, locally produced copies of what appeared on Parisian runways. \u201cWomen running department stores (had) an innate understanding that men lacked,\u201d Satow explained. \u201cHortense Odlum was very much trying to make the department store a welcoming place\u2026 She saw herself as a hostess, in a way.\u201d (Odlum\u2019s perspective was, in large part, driven by her own experiences; until her husband\u2019s law career flourished with the couple\u2019s move to New York, she had been all-too-budgeted in her fashion choices and all-too-conscious of clothes as a status symbol. Her motivation was to make department stores enticing \u2014 and accessible \u2014 for women of all means.) And Geraldine Stutz, who transitioned into the retail business after roles in fashion media, implemented concepts still relevant to the industry today. Henri Bendel recruited her in 1964 as a last ditch attempt to save their store from bankruptcy \u2014 there, \u201cshe originated the boutique experience that we still see today, including the divisions of brands within a store,\u201d Satow said. Within three years, Stutz had doubled sales; she was elected to the Fashion Industry Hall of Fame in 1985. \u201cAll three women created a special atmosphere and ambiance within their stores. Today, shopping is not nearly as immersive and experiential as it was,\u201d Satow explained. \u201cI think there is a nostalgia for the golden era of the department store, and it is always bittersweet when an era like that ends,\u201d she continued. \u201cNow, with everything from Etsy to TikTok, nearly anyone with (the) will and a small budget can start their own brand. The opportunities department stores afforded women are less critical than they once were.\u201d Add to queue: Shop it like it\u2019s hot Read: \u201cThe Women In Black\u201d by Madeleine St. John (1993) This novel is set within the fictional F.G. Goode department store in 1950s Sydney, Australia. The titular women in black are the saleswomen, whose personal and professional dramas intersect as they weather the politics of the womenswear department. Considered an Australian classic, the book has been translated onto the big screen and stage. Watch: \u201cMannequin\u201d (1987) In this quintessentially \u201880s cult classic, Kim Cattrall plays, wait for it, a mannequin seemingly dreamed into life by jack-of-all-trades Jonathan Switcher (Andrew McCarthy). The pair build a partnership, both professionally \u2014 staging attention-grabbing window displays at a failing department store \u2014 and romantically. The catch to this love story: Emmy only comes to life for Jonathan. Is it ridiculous and campy? Of course, but Hollywood Montrose would have it no other way. Read: \u201cThe Dallergut Dream Department Store\u201d (2024) A bestseller in Korea, the debut novel (and first of a two-book series) from author Miye Lee weaves a fantastical narrative around, as its title suggests, a department store selling consumers\u2019 perfect dreams. In lieu of traditional store floors and sections like womenswear or home furnishings, shoppers can browse well-curated dream worlds \u2014 nostalgia, travel, fantasy and even nightmare \u2014 to find the perfect fit for their slumber; promoting the value of bedtime like any good sleep salesman would, the book also highlights the importance of quality shut-eye on the subconscious. Watch: \u201cThe Devil and Miss Jones\u201d (1941) It was common practice in department stores of the 1930s and 40s to employ undercover shoppers and in-store detectives to keep an eye on both customers and employees, identifying union organizers in particular \u2014 as American workers today are increasingly looking to unions to combat stagnant wages and layoffs, the 1941 film \u201cThe Devil and Miss Jones\u201d feels remarkably prescient. Its plot sees John P. Merrick (Charles Coburn) as the New York retail tycoon who pretends to be a shoe clerk at one of his stores where he suspects his workers are attempting to form a union, opposite Mary Jones (Jean Arthur) as the captivating salesgirl who somehow wins her boss over to sympathizing with their cause.

The Polish star will be the strong favorite to win her fifth grand slam title this weekend having extended her winning run to 18 matches in all competitions and 20 at Roland Garros. Against Gauff, \u015awi\u0105tek has now been victorious in 11 of their past 12 meetings. In Saturday\u2019s final, \u015awi\u0105tek could win a third straight French Open title when she faces Italy\u2019s Jasmine Paolini \u2013 a feat no woman has achieved since Justine Henin in 2007. \u201cFor sure, it was intense,\u201d the 23-year-old said in her on-court interview after defeating Gauff. \u201cIn the second set it was kind of tight because we were breaking each other. I\u2019m happy that I was consistent with my tactics, didn\u2019t overthink stuff and just went for it at the end.\u201d Having dropped only two games across her last two matches, \u015awi\u0105tek was predictably pushed harder against Gauff in a repeat of the 2022 French Open final, but remained in control for large periods of the one-hour, 37-minute contest on Court Philippe-Chatrier. The world No. 1 broke her opponent in the opening game and then again at 3-1 to take a commanding lead in the first set, which she wrapped up soon after when Gauff put a forehand return into the net. In a highly-charged moment in the second set, Gauff became visibly emotional as she argued with the chair umpire over a call before breaking \u015awi\u0105tek\u2019s serve several points later for a 3-1 lead. The defending champion responded well, however, winning the next four games in a row to take a 5-3 advantage, and from there victory was within her grasp. Gauff continued to battle hard, saving three match points across the next two games, but was unable to find a way back into the semifinal as a stray forehand handed \u015awi\u0105tek the win. In Thursday\u2019s other semifinal, Paolini defeated Russian 17-year-old Mirra Andreeva 6-3 6-1 to book a place in her first grand slam final.

Cross-border attacks from Lebanon led to large fires blazing through Israel\u2019s northern region this week, consuming swathes of land and leading to the evacuation of residents. Israel attributed the blaze to rocket fire from southern Lebanon, where Hezbollah said it had launched a \u201cswarm of drones\u201d at Israeli military sites. On Wednesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the northern city of Kiryat Shmona\u00a0near the Lebanese border, saying that Israel is prepared for \u201cvery intense action\u201d in the north. \u201cWhoever thinks that they can hurt us and that we will sit idly by is making a big mistake,\u201d the prime minister said. \u201cOne way or another, we will restore security to the north.\u201d Netanyahu\u2019s comments come after Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi said the Israeli military is ready to attack targets in the north. \u201cWe are prepared after a very good process of training \u2013 up to the level of a military exercise \u2013 to move to an attack in the north. Strong defense, readiness to attack, we are approaching a decision point,\u201d Halevi said on Tuesday. Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon have been trading fire since the start of Israel\u2019s war on Hamas in Gaza in October. In April, the IDF said it is \u201cpreparing to move from defense to attack,\u201d referring to operations on the northern border. The Lebanese group has said its attacks on Israel are in protest to Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. Naim Qassem, Hezbollah\u2019s second-in-command, told Al Jazeera on Tuesday that Hezbollah is a front to support Gaza \u201cand that front doesn\u2019t stop until the war (in Gaza) stops.\u201d He said that the group\u2019s assessment was that recent threats from Israel were not serious. \u201cEither way, we have decided not to widen the battle and we do not want an all-out war. But if it is imposed on us, we are ready and we won\u2019t retreat,\u201d he said. The IDF says it has killed around 300 Hezbollah fighters, and Reuters reported that around 80 civilians have been killed in Lebanon by Israeli fire. Ten Israeli civilians and 18 soldiers have also been killed on the border, the Israeli military said. More than 94,000 Lebanese have been displaced from areas and towns close to the border with Israel since the conflict started, according to figures released Tuesday by the Lebanese Ministry of Public Health. More than 53,000 Israelis have been evacuated from the country\u2019s north since hostilities began in October, the IDF told CNN. \u2018Strategic trap\u2019 \u201cIsrael has been caught in a strategic trap up north,\u201d Amos Harel, a defense analyst, wrote in Israeli newspaper Haaretz on Wednesday. \u201cIt has proven unable to force Hezbollah into a cease-fire as long as the fighting in Gaza continues, whereas the Lebanese organization has managed to create a kind of \u2018security zone\u2019 devoid of residents inside Israeli territory, despite suffering much higher losses than the IDF has.\u201d On Wednesday, far-right Israeli Minister of National Security Itamar Ben Gvir said it was now the IDF\u2019s job to \u201csimply to destroy Hezbollah\u201d. \u201cIt cannot be that our land is being targeted and harmed, and people here have evacuated,\u201d he said on Telegram. \u201cAll Hezbollah strongholds must be burned and destroyed. War!\u201d Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said in an interview with Israeli radio station Reshet bet however that the IDF isn\u2019t interested in broadening the war to eliminate Hezbollah. The military is \u201ctelling us right now that it doesn\u2019t want to\u2026 launch an attack in the north, fight and defeat Hezbollah, and overwhelm it and create a security zone.\u201d Amid an uptick in tensions on the border, senior Israeli minister Benny Gantz, a member of the war cabinet, has said that the country cannot afford to lose another year in the north. \u201cI have been fighting for months with the government, with the prime minister and with everyone, that by September 1 we will finish the job here and be able to start something else. It will happen with either a solution or escalation, but we can\u2019t lose another year here,\u201d he said. Last month, Gantz threatened to leave the national unity government unless a six-point plan was agreed by June 8 that included the return of residents displaced by attacks from Lebanon. An Iran-backed Islamist movement with one of the most powerful paramilitary forces in the Middle East, Hezbollah has opened another front against Israel. The group is seen as Iran\u2019s most effective non-state partner, possessing 150,000 rockets that could overwhelm Israel\u2019s defenses if an all-out war breaks out. A wider conflict could also draw Iran and the United States into the war. Israel and Iran came close to war in April after launching unprecedented direct attacks on each other\u2019s soil. \u201cNot only is there no military solution on the horizon (in northern Israel), but the time that\u2019s passed has led many to consider leaving the area permanently, especially with a new school year due to open in September,\u201d Harel wrote.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/middleeast/israel-lebanon-cross-border-tensions-escalate-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_06_africa_sudanese-government-accuses-militia-massacre-intl", "text": "At least 150 people were killed and 200 injured in an attack by rebel forces in Sudan, local officials and witnesses said, in the latest atrocity in the year-long war that has displaced more than 7 million people. Eyewitnesses told CNN Thursday how fighters from Sudan\u2019s paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) descended upon Wad al-Nour village in the central Al-Jazira state on Wednesday. They described scenes of terror and carnage as over 40 armed vehicles stormed the village, unleashing heavy weaponry on its inhabitants, killing and wounding mostly civilians, among them children and women. Fighting is still ongoing just a few kilometers away, with terrified villagers fearful of further escalations, the witness said. Another eyewitness reported the ongoing grim task of counting the dead and injured. \u201cSo far, we\u2019ve buried more than 120 people in a mass grave in the middle of the village,\u201d he said. CNN cannot independently verify the exact number of casualties. Footage shared on social media Wednesday, and geolocated by CNN, shows a large crowd in Wad Al-Noura village surrounding dozens of dead bodies, shrouded in white, as preparations were being made for their burial. Another video allegedly shows the RSF militia firing heavy and medium weapons towards the village. Both the Sudanese army and the RSF have faced damning accusations of civilian massacres since the civil war broke out in April 2023. The RSF acknowledged the attack in a statement Wednesday and said it was a pre-emptive attack on\u00a0Sudan\u2019s Armed Forces (SAF),\u00a0camps in Wad Al-Noura in response to a planned attack by the army.\u00a0They did not acknowledge the civilian deaths reported. According to the RSF, eight of its fighters were killed, others injured, and they seized vehicles, weapons, and military equipment during the operation. However, eyewitnesses told CNN that there is no military presence in the village, adding that the Sudanese army operates a military base about 30 km (19 miles) southwest of Wad Al-Noura, which is being cited as a possible reason for the attack. CNN has contacted both RSF and the Sudanese Army for comment. The leader of the SAF vowed to retaliate after arriving in a city near the attack where he visited survivors, according to state news agency SUNA. \u201cThe response to the militia\u2019s crimes against the martyrs of [Wad al-Nour] will be severe and harsh,\u201d warned Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, SAF Commander-in-Chief and President of the Sudanese Transitional Sovereignty Council. A strategic target Wad al-Nour village lies about 160 kilometers south of Sudanese capital Khartoum and is now the latest epicenter of violence in a country ravaged by internal conflict. The village has long been a strategic target for the RSF, given its close location to Al-Manaqil, where the Sudanese army maintains its only presence in Al-Jazira state. This was not the first attempt by the RSF to control Wad al-Noura, as they have tried several times to take the village. Thousands have perished since fighting erupted between forces loyal to two rival generals \u2013 army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, leader of the SAF, and General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, head of the RSF. Since the conflict started, both the Sudanese army and the RSF have faced damning accusations of civilian massacres. The RSF has specifically targeted villages in Al-Jazira, Sudan\u2019s agricultural heartland, to swell its ranks through forced conscription and using hunger as a weapon, eyewitnesses have said. In March, eyewitnesses told CNN\u00a0that more than 700 people, including dozens of children, were forcibly recruited from the state by the militia group after being ordered to \u201cenlist or die.\u201d The RSF denied this claim. International outcry and humanitarian crisis The Sudanese Transitional Sovereignty Council condemned the RSF\u2019s actions, describing them as part of a systematic campaign of violence against civilians. \u201cThis heinous crime is added to the series of crimes committed by this rebel militia in many states of Sudan. These are criminal acts that reflect the systematic behavior of these militias in targeting civilians, plundering their property, and forcibly displacing them from their areas,\u201d the Council stated. A UN representative on Thursday expressed deep concern over the reported violence and called for a thorough investigation and accountability for those responsible. \u201cEven by the tragic standards of Sudan\u2019s conflict, the images emerging from Wad Al-Noura are heart-breaking. Wars have rules that need to be respected, no matter what,\u201d UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Sudan Clementine Nkweta-Salami said. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) has warned that \u201cthe number of people displaced by conflict inside Sudan could top 10 million in the coming days.\u201d \u201cThe world\u2019s worst internal displacement crisis continues to escalate, with looming famine and disease adding to the havoc wrought by conflict,\u201d IOM said in a statement on Thursday. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs noted that over 8.8 million people have fled their homes, and 24.8 million urgently need assistance. Last week at the UN Security Council, Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide Alice Wairimu Nderitu warned, \u201cThe situation today bears all the marks of risk of genocide, with strong allegations that this crime has already been committed.\u201d CNN\u2019s Avery Schmitz contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/africa/sudanese-government-accuses-militia-massacre-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "world"}}

The school, run by the UN agency for Palestinian refugees\u00a0(UNRWA), was housing displaced people in the Nuseirat refugee camp at the time of the incident, the Gaza government media office said. At least 40 people were killed in the strike, according to medical workers at the nearby Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital. Authorities at the hospital said casualties could rise as victims were still being brought to the hospital on Thursday morning. The Israeli military confirmed it carried out the airstrike, which it said targeted a Hamas compound operating inside the school. Israeli military spokesperson Lt. Col. Peter Lerner later told journalists the military was not \u201caware of any civilian casualties.\u201d Lerner said \u201c20 to 30 Hamas and Islamic Jihad\u201d militants were targeted in the strike, and that those targeted were \u201cusing the facilities to plan and execute attacks\u201d against Israeli forces. Militants who were involved in the October 7 attacks on Israel were among those killed, Lerner said. Later on Thursday, the Israeli military said it had so far identified nine alleged Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters targeted in\u00a0the strike. CNN cannot independently verify any of those claims or the identities of the nine people the IDF said it identified. A CNN analysis of video from the scene and a review by an explosive weapons expert\u00a0found that US-made munitions were used in the strike on the school. CNN identified fragments of at least two US-made GBU-39 small diameter bombs (SDB) in video filmed at the scene by a journalist working for CNN. It marks the second time in two weeks that CNN has been able to verify the use of US-manufactured munitions in deadly Israeli attacks on displaced Palestinians, the first being a deadly IDF strike on\u00a0a displacement camp in Rafah on May 26. Asked whether American weapons were used in the strike, US State Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller said Thursday that was a question for the Israeli government. Miller said the US has been in contact with Israel over the strike and that Israel has only told the US \u201cessentially what they have said publicly.\u201d He added that the Israeli government would release more information, which the US expects to be \u201cfully transparent.\u201d Thursday\u2019s attack came after the IDF ramped up ground and air assaults in the center of the strip on Tuesday amid a deepening humanitarian crisis there. Palestinians in central Gaza have reported that the intensity and frequency of Israeli strikes in the last week have felt like the beginning of the war. According to a journalist in the area working with CNN, the school was hit by at least three missiles that penetrated the three-story building. The facility was believed to be housing thousands of displaced people who had taken shelter in the school, its yard, and the surrounding area,\u00a0according to the journalist. UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini said the school was sheltering about 6,000 displaced people. \u201cWe were asleep here, (and) we suddenly saw rockets falling. I went down holding my child, we were both injured, my relative was martyred in that room,\u201d journalist J\ufeffaber Abu Daher told CNN on Thursday. He said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \u201cis killing the civilians, he is not killing militants, it\u2019s innocent people asleep in a UNRWA facility\u2026 what did children and\u00a0elderly do? What did they do to him? He is looking for Hamas people? Go look for them, why are you killing us in schools?\u201d The Israeli military defended the bombing of the school, saying it had so far identified nine alleged militants it had targeted in the pre-dawn strike, its spokesperson Daniel Hagari said Thursday. He said the IDF believes there were \u201cabout 30\u201d militants hiding inside the UN school but did not provide further evidence or information as to how the IDF has come to this conclusion. Hagari added that Israeli forces, using aerial surveillance over several days, had delayed the strike on the school twice because they had identified civilians in the area. \u201cWe conducted the strike once our intelligence and surveillance indicated there were no women or children inside the Hamas compound inside those classrooms,\u201d Hagari said. He also accused Hamas of violating international law by allegedly using the UN school as an operational base. The US State Department said Israel\u2019s strike did not cross US President Joe Biden\u2019s so-called \u201cred line\u201d because that line referred to a \u201clarge-scale operation in Rafah,\u201d which the US has not yet seen. \u201cThat said, we have seen strikes that put civilians in danger well before the president said that, and we have made clear to the government of Israel that we expect them to do everything that they can to minimize civilian harm,\u201d Miller said. The UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned the strike, saying \u201cUN premises are inviolable, including during armed conflict and must be protected by all parties at all times,\u201d according to his spokesperson St\u00e9phane Dujarric. US-made weapon used Gaza authorities said the dead and injured continue to be brought to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, which is operating at three times its clinical capacity, \u201csignaling a real disaster that will lead to a greater increase in the number of martyrs,\u201d the Gaza media office said. UNRWA said its school was \u201cpossibly hit several times\u201d overnight by the strikes. An UNRWA spokesperson told CNN it was not able to confirm Israeli reports that Hamas operatives had been using the school as a compound. \u201cWe remind all parties to the conflict that schools and other UN premises must never be used for military or fighting purposes,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cUN facilities must be protected at all times.\u201d Lazzarini said in a post on X that while \u201cclaims that armed groups may have been inside the shelter are shocking\u201d they have been unable to verify it. \u201cAttacking, targeting or using UN buildings for military purposes are a blatant disregard of International Humanitarian law,\u201d he added. \ufeffMunitions made in the US were also used in the\u00a0deadly Israeli strike\u00a0on\u00a0a displacement camp in Rafah late last month, a CNN analysis of video from the scene and a review by explosive weapons experts found. After that attack, US President Joe Biden refused calls to alter his policy towards Israel, suggesting the deadly Rafah strike had not yet crossed a red line that would force changes in American support. He had previously said in a CNN interview that he wouldn\u2019t allow certain US weapons to be\u00a0used in a major offensive in Rafah. In April, CNN reported that the Biden administration authorized the transfer to Israel of over 1,000 small-diameter bombs, according to three people familiar with the matter. \u2018The situation is apocalyptic\u2019 An Israeli strike hit the same camp last month and killed dozens of people, Al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital said at the time. One woman, Um Mohammad Taha, told CNN then that five houses had collapsed, including her sister\u2019s, and that many were buried under the rubble, including children. And another Israeli attack on the Nuseirat camp in April injured several journalists, including one working with CNN. Doctors Without Borders/M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF), which has supported Al-Aqsa hospital, said Wednesday it had taken in more than 70 people who had been killed, and more than 300 injured, in just 48 hours, amid an escalation in bombing and ground fighting. Karin Huster, an MSF nurse, said in the group\u2019s statement: \u201cWe have seen hospitals being bombed. We have seen refugee camps being bombed. We have seen humanitarian warehouses being bombed. The situation is apocalyptic.\u201d \u201cThe odor of blood when I entered the emergency room was just overwhelming. People are lying on the floor. People are lying outside,\u201d Huster added. \u201cIt\u2019s just an emotionally overwhelming situation.\u201d Israel\u2019s renewed focus on bombarding central Gaza highlights again the elusive nature of its stated ambition to destroy Hamas. The brunt of the Israeli military campaign had, in recent months, moved south towards Rafah, but rocket fire and ground warfare have now again engulfed encampments further north such as Nuseirat and areas like Bureij, both just south of Gaza City. \u201cEvery place we went to after they said it\u2019s safe was struck \u2013 I want the war to stop,\u201d Mohammad Farajallah, a child who said his two brothers were killed in Thursday\u2019s strike, told CNN as he rifled through the rubble of the school. The latest attack also came as American, Egyptian and Qatari officials\u00a0met in Doha to revive negotiations on a new ceasefire and hostage release deal. The meetings follow a\u00a0three-phase proposal\u00a0\u2014 characterized as an Israeli plan \u2014 laid out by US President Joe Biden that would pair a release of hostages with a \u201cfull and complete ceasefire\u201d in Gaza. On Wednesday, Israel\u2019s Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant said the country\u2019s military offensive in Gaza would not be halted for any resumption of ceasefire and hostage release talks with Hamas. \u201cWe are in a process of continuous engagement to wear down the enemy. Any negotiations with the terrorist organization Hamas will only be conducted under fire,\u201d Gallant said in a recorded video statement.

{"id": "2024_05_31_europe_far-right-european-election-intl", "text": "This is a historic and pivotal year for democracy across the globe. Around\u00a070 countries\u00a0\u2013 from the\u00a0United States\u00a0to\u00a0South Africa, via\u00a0Mexico\u00a0and\u00a0Taiwan\u00a0\u2013 will hold elections in 2024. After India\u2019s huge and ongoing six-week ballot, however, the biggest election in terms of voter numbers takes place this week, when 373 million Europeans can go to the polls and elect 720 members of the next European Parliament. Once the votes have been tallied from across the 27-nation bloc, it is widely expected that the results will show a significant shift to the right, which could have major implications for the political direction of the European Union at a time\u00a0when it is battling\u00a0multiple crises,\u00a0many of them global. From the war in Ukraine to coping with mass migration, the rise of China to the threat of climate change, it\u2019s hard to see how a bloc of\u00a0diverse\u00a0countries could possibly speak with one voice. Of course, differences in opinion among\u00a0the\u00a0member states is nothing new. EU politics has always relied on awkward alliances between countries and political ideologies that represent vastly different electorates. The EU\u2019s political center has undeniably moved to the right over the past two decades,\u00a0however. The European Parliament is the place where this is most visible at an EU level. Most\u00a0of the lawmakers (known as MEPs)\u00a0belong to a political party in their own country.\u00a0Once they enter\u00a0the European Parliament\u00a0in the Belgian capital of Brussels, they sit in loose, multinational political groupings that broadly have similar political interests. These groupings then form even looser coalitions,\u00a0which\u00a0usually results with a majority grouping of centrists from the center-left, center-right and liberals somewhere in the middle. The rightward shift of the political center in this coalition has been gradual. In 1994, the main socialist group S&D had the most MEPs. In 1999,\u00a0it was\u00a0overtaken by the center-right European People\u2019s Party (EPP). The EPP, best explained as conservatives in the mold of former German Chancellor Angela Merkel,\u00a0has\u00a0been the dominant force in\u00a0EU\u00a0politics ever since. While the EPP has been able to lead a mainstream centrist coalition with the left and liberals at a European level, MEPs are still beholden to domestic politics happening back in their own countries. For example, it\u2019s not easy for a conservative to work with a liberal on a pan-EU policy that would share the burden of asylum seekers if voters back home are becoming attracted to loud, anti-immigration populists. The louder the domestic noise \u2013 and the greater the risk of losing their own seat in parliament \u2013 the trickier cross-party politics at a Brussels level becomes. The anticipated influx of\u00a0lawmakers into groups\u00a0to the EPP\u2019s right will\u00a0certainly\u00a0complicate matters. While the\u00a0right-wing\u00a0European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) and\u00a0far-right\u00a0Identity and Democracy (ID)\u00a0groups\u00a0are expected to finish fourth and fifth respectively in terms of seat numbers, their combined tally, which could be upwards of 140,\u00a0according to the Politico Poll of Polls, will be hard for the EPP to ignore.\u00a0The EPP is currently predicted to win 165 seats to 143 for the socialist S&D. ECR and ID are typical of European\u00a0Parliament\u00a0parties in that they are home to a pretty broad group of conservatives. The ECR, for example, was founded by former British Prime Minister David Cameron who campaigned against Brexit. Its current chair is Italian PM Giorgia Meloni, who garnered lots of attention during the 2022 Italian election for her opposition to\u00a0LGBTQ+\u00a0rights,\u00a0promises to curb migration and general anti-globalist rhetoric. However, since\u00a0Meloni\u2019s\u00a0election, she has been seen as considerably more moderate and has supported many key EU initiatives, including support for Ukraine. She has also resisted allowing\u00a0authoritarian\u00a0Hungarian\u00a0leader\u00a0Viktor Orban to join the ECR after he left the EPP. Hungary has been the most pro-Russia EU voice since the start of the war. Whether or not it was deliberate on Meloni\u2019s part, resistance to Orban has made working with her and the ECR more palatable to the Brussels establishment, including EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. ID, too, has sought to moderate its image. It\u00a0recently expelled\u00a0the German far-right AfD party from its ranks after one of its most senior MEPs told an Italian newspaper\u00a0that he didn\u2019t see all members of the SS, the notorious Nazi paramilitary group, automatically as criminals. There is quite a wide range in opinion from the moderate wing of the ERC to the fringes of ID, but political\u00a0currents\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0desire for influence\u00a0can result in some\u00a0odd bedfellows, especially in the opaque and fluid world of European politics. It is unlikely that the EPP would be willing to work directly with ID any time soon, but that doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t be important. History has shown us repeatedly that it\u2019s possible to influence policy from outside the tent. Suppose\u00a0that\u00a0parties associated with ID start putting center-right\u00a0politicians\u00a0under pressure in their own countries. You might find the center adopts their policy ideas \u2013\u00a0as has previously happened in France, the\u00a0United Kingdom\u00a0and Germany. And there are\u00a0more than\u00a0enough hot topics in Europe now for the right to get its teeth stuck into. Migration, climate change, border security, military spending, rule of law \u2013 all of these have been flashpoints in pan-Europe politics for a long time and are not going away any time soon. And it is ultimately the newly-elected Parliament that vets and approves the\u00a0make-up\u00a0of the\u00a0European\u00a0Commission \u2013 the EU\u2019s executive body. It\u2019s worth noting that support for Ukraine is expected to be safe\u00a0for the time being, with the pro-Kremlin\u00a0groups appearing\u00a0very\u00a0isolated. But almost everything else will be handled on a case-by-case basis if the numbers work out that way. And the more MEPs elected that are to the right of the EPP, the more their influence could grow over time. Five years is a long time in politics, and that is how long this Parliament will last. In that time, France will hold an election that Marine Le Pen, who is affiliated with ID, might win\u00a0with her National Rally party. Geert Wilders, also ID, is soon expected to form a government in the Netherlands after emerging as the biggest party in their\u00a0November\u00a0elections. In other words, the domestic politics in member states could shift even further to the right, which naturally changes calculations in Brussels. The European Parliament\u00a0can often seem like\u00a0looks\u00a0like a boring, bureaucratic blob, tediously grinding its way through process. But the EU is an increasingly geopolitical player \u2013 able to impose sanctions on Russian and Chinese political figures, provide funds to Ukraine and use its economic heft as the world\u2019s largest trading bloc in diplomacy. If its political center is indeed shifting to the right, its influence will inevitably have\u00a0meaningful\u00a0and\u00a0perhaps far-reaching\u00a0consequences for people\u00a0living beyond Europe\u2019s\u00a0borders.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/europe/far-right-european-election-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "world"}}

Russia\u2019s Foreign Ministry on Wednesday posted a photo of Lavrov in Ouagadougou, noting that he had been received by acting President Ibrahim Traor\u00e9. Lavrov was accompanied on the trip by Russian Deputy Defense Minister Yevkurov. Burkina\u00a0Faso is\u00a0currently under military rule\u00a0after a junta staged a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in July 2022. Its junta, headed by Traor\u00e9, has said it is prioritizing building up security\u00a0amid an ongoing and deadly internal conflict. Violence-related deaths in\u00a0Burkina\u00a0Faso doubled last year, according to the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC). So far in 2024, hundreds of civilians have already been killed in attacks this year, including around 170 in three villages\u00a0in March, and approximately 30 in separate mosque and church attacks\u00a0in February. Engulfed in violence, Burkina\u00a0Faso has been named the world\u2019s most neglected displacement crisis for the second year, by the NRC. In 2024, 6.3 million people in the country will need humanitarian assistance, the aid organization said, with over two million people internally displaced. US officials have warned for years now that both Russia and China are working to build influence in Africa. In 2019, the former head of US Africa Command, Gen. Thomas Waldhauser also said that Russia was using mercenaries and arms sales to gain access to natural resources in Africa. Isolated from much of the world due to its invasion of Ukraine, Russia appears to be renewing overtures in the continent. In early March of this year, Africa Command again warned Congress that Russia was aggressively working to expand its footing in Africa, and that several countries were \u201cat the tipping point\u201d of falling under its influence. In his comments this week, Lavrov also thanked Burkinabe leaders for their \u201ceffective assistance in resolving issues that allowed us to resume the activities of our embassy in Ouagadougou.\u201d \u201cWe are implementing a program to resume the activities of Russian diplomatic missions in Africa.\u00a0Burkina\u00a0Faso was the first country to do this quickly and effectively,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/africa/russia-burkina-faso-military-instructors-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_04_asia_cambodia-lloyd-austin-china-intl-hnk", "text": "US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin traveled to Cambodia on Tuesday to meet with the country\u2019s prime minister and defense minister, as Washington becomes increasingly concerned that Phnom Penh\u00a0may grant China\u2019s military exclusive access to a key naval base. Austin\u2019s trip to the Cambodian capital marks his second visit to the Southeast Asian country as Secretary of Defense but is the first time a United States defense chief has traveled to Cambodia specifically to hold a bilateral meeting with his counterpart, Defense Minister Tea Seiha. The outreach reflects the US\u2019 desire to forge a better relationship with Cambodia, defense officials said, particularly as Beijing\u2019s influence over the country has only continued to grow in recent years. \u201cWe believe there is potentially an opportunity, with leadership transition in Cambodia, for us to sit down and talk about how our relationship might have a more positive and optimistic path in the future,\u201d a senior defense official told reporters, referring to Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet, who took office last year following his father Hun Sen\u2019s nearly four-decade rule. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a visit that is about significant deliverables and achievements.\u201d Austin did express the US\u2019 concerns, however, about China\u2019s funding of and presence at Cambodia\u2019s Ream Naval Base on the Gulf of Thailand, officials said. In December, China docked two warships at the base, which is in a highly strategic position close to the South China Sea. Cambodian officials have repeatedly denied the facility would be used by China as a naval base, insisting the project is in line with Cambodia\u2019s constitution, which bars foreign military bases on its territory. Chinese officials, meanwhile, have described the base as an\u00a0\u201caid project\u201d\u00a0to strengthen Cambodia\u2019s navy and called assertions otherwise \u201chype\u201d with \u201culterior motives.\u201d Beijing claims \u201cindisputable sovereignty\u201d over almost all of the 1.3-million-square-mile South China Sea, a characterization the US and many of its Indo-Pacific allies reject. Chinese vessels and aircraft have been widely documented harassing others operating in the area, including American ships and planes. The US has been particularly alarmed in recent weeks by China\u2019s attacks on Philippine vessels in the South China Sea using powerful water cannons. China also carried out large-scale military drills around the self-governing island of Taiwan last week as \u201cpunishment\u201d for its inauguration of a new president, who is openly loathed by Beijing for championing the island\u2019s sovereignty. The behavior underscores why the US is worried about the possibility that China could establish a new military outpost so close to the key waterway. \u201cThere are no doubts about where our concerns are,\u201d a Pentagon spokesperson said following Austin\u2019s meetings, when asked about Ream. \u201cMeeting face-to-face gives us a chance not only to speak clearly about our concerns, but to talk about how we might work together in the future to strengthen our relationship. And we don\u2019t ask any country to choose between partners.\u201d But as China and Cambodia have reaffirmed their military cooperation, relations between Washington and Phnom Penh have grown increasingly strained. Cambodia canceled military exercises with the US in 2017 and demolished a US-built facility at Ream in 2020, as the US has repeatedly condemned the country\u2019s poor human rights record and democratic backsliding. Last year, the Biden administration\u00a0imposed sanctions on Cambodian individuals in response to Cambodia\u2019s election, which the State Department characterized as \u201cneither free nor fair.\u201d On Tuesday, however, Austin met with former Prime Minister Hun Sen, who now serves as president of Cambodia\u2019s Senate after\u00a0transferring power to his son,\u00a0a military general. Defense officials are particularly hopeful that Austin can forge a relationship with Prime Minister Hun Manet, who, like Austin, attended the US Military Academy at West Point and is seen as more westernized than his father. In a readout following Austin\u2019s meetings, the Pentagon said\u00a0the \u201cofficials\u00a0discussed opportunities to strengthen the US-Cambodia bilateral defense relationship in support of regional peace and security, including through the resumption of military training exchanges on disaster assistance and United Nations Peacekeeping, training and exchanges on de-mining and unexploded ordnance clearance, and Cambodia\u2019s access to US PME [professional military education] programs. They also welcomed continued discussions about these issues between their respective defense establishments.\u201d Austin\u2019s visit to Phnom Penh capped a five-day trip to Asia, where he attended the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore and warned of China\u2019s \u201ccoercive\u201d activities in the region while working to deepen the US\u2019 relationships with key Asian leaders. In a meeting with China\u2019s Defense Minister Dong Jun last week, their first face-to-face, Austin said the US wants to keep military-to-military channels open with the Chinese to avoid misunderstandings and escalation. In a combative speech later on, Dong appeared to agree with that, but he also slammed \u201cexternal interfering forces\u201d for selling arms and having \u201cillegal official contacts\u201d with Taiwan \u2014 a thinly veiled reference to the US, which maintains close yet unofficial ties with the island democracy. In the same remarks, however, Dong said Beijing \u201cnever acts from the so-called position of strength.\u201d A senior US official told CNN that the speech was \u201cat complete odds with the reality\u201d of\u00a0China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army\u2019s\u00a0\u201ccoercive activity across the region.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/asia/cambodia-lloyd-austin-china-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_03_asia_shangrila-dialogue-china-trump-intl-hnk", "text": "Any tourist wandering through the glitzy lobby of Singapore\u2019s Shangri-La Hotel this weekend would have stumbled on a rather bizarre scene. Military officers from around the world thronged the halls of the luxury hotel, their shoulders dripping with gold braids and epaulets, complicated colored bars lined up on the chests of their dress uniforms like some martial game of Tetris. Every few minutes a defense minister strode purposely through the mix, surrounded by a phalanx of aides and escorts. This gathering is an annual spectacle that to the uninitiated might seem surreal. But the topics being discussed here are deadly serious. The annual Shangri-La Dialogue is one of the few places in the world where you can watch warriors who spend their careers preparing for armed conflict, engaged in polite, carefully-moderated debate. The stakes this year could hardly be higher. War rages in both the Middle East and Europe. Meanwhile China\u2019s increasingly assertive moves has much of the Asia-Pacific on edge. The Singapore summit brought key players together. Where else would you have the President of the Philippines, a nation whichdo has seen its vessels increasingly targeted by Chinese coast guard ships in the disputed South China Sea, deliver a keynote address on the same stage that, two days later, Beijing\u2019s new Defense Minister makes his debut appearance? There was even a surprise appearance from Ukraine\u2019s embattled president Volodymyr Zelensky \u2013 and a first face-to-face meeting between US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and his Chinese counterpart Adm Dong Jun. Given its location in the city-state of Singapore, events in Asia \u2013 and in particular China\u2019s behavior in the region \u2013 stalked the conference. In his keynote speech, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. issued a stark warning about the ongoing confrontations between Philippine and China Coast Guard vessels in a contested part of the South China Sea. \u201cIf a Filipino citizen is killed by a willful act,\u201d he said, \u201cthat is I think, very, very close to what we define as an act of war.\u201d Two days later, China\u2019s Adm Dong fired back from the same stage, accusing the Philippines of \u201cblackmail\u201d in the maritime dispute. \u201cThere is a limit to our restraint,\u201d said Admiral Dong Jun. \u201cI saw that as a threat,\u201d said Dewi Fortuna Anwar, a research professor at Indonesia\u2019s National Research and Innovation Center who has been attending the Shangri-La Dialogue since its founding twenty-one years ago. \u201cIn decades past, the Chinese only came in a small number and they were extremely quiet,\u201d she said.\u00a0 \u201cNow they\u2019re very self confident\u2026they intervene in all the sessions.\u201d The open nature of the Shangri-La Dialogue provides delegates with a unique opportunity to ask blunt questions of speakers. After his speech on Sunday, China\u2019s Dong received many questions from audience members on Beijing\u2019s increased threats towards self-governing Taiwan as well as its disputed claims in the South China Sea, and he replied in unapologetic terms. The \u201cseparatists\u201d in Taiwan\u2019s newly-elected government would\u00a0be \u201cnailed to the pillar of shame in history,\u201d he said. But equally, Chinese military officers also used Q&A sessions at other key moments to make their views known. Senior Colonel Yanzhong Cao of China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army asked US Secretary of Defense asked US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin whether the US was trying to build a NATO-like alliance in the Asia-Pacific region, adding the claim \u201cthe eastward expansion of NATO has led to the Ukraine crisis.\u201d \u201cI respectfully disagree,\u201d Austin replied, the audience in the ballroom then erupting into a rare burst of applause. \u201cThe Ukraine crisis obviously was caused because Mr. Putin made a decision to unlawfully invade his neighbor,\u201d Austin continued. \u201cThis was brought on because of a decision by Mr. Putin.\u201d Later that day, Ukrainian leader Zelensky got a borderline rock star welcome when he made a surprise appearance at the conference, dressed in his trademark fatigues and black t-shirt. \u201cWe stand with you,\u201d Ng Eng Hen, Singapore\u2019s minister of defense, later said to Zelensky. But the large contingent of Chinese army officers present at other sessions was notably absent during Zelensky\u2019s speech and the Ukrainian leader said he failed to secure a one-on-one meeting with Chinese officials during his Singapore visit. He also accused Beijing of aiding Ukraine\u2019s mortal enemy. \u201cWith China\u2019s support to Russia, the war will last longer.\u00a0\u00a0That is bad for the whole world, and the policy of China \u2013 who declares that it supports territorial integrity and sovereignty and declares it officially. For them it is not good,\u201d Zelensky told journalists. It was not clear whether Zelensky succeeded in securing new support for Kyiv from non-aligned south-east Asian countries like Malaysia and Indonesia. Instead, Indonesian president-elect and retired general Prabowo Subianto \u2013 the new leader of the world\u2019s most populous Muslim majority nation \u2013 spent much of his speech calling for an end to the on-going carnage in Gaza and an investigation into recent Israeli attacks that killed dozens of displaced civilians in Rafah. Another political elephant in the room was what direction might the United States be heading in. The Singapore gathering began just hours after a 12-person jury in a court-room in New York City\u00a0convicted former US President Donald Trump on of all 34 counts of falsifying business records in his hush money criminal trial. Asia is watching very closely for whether Trump will return to office in November and what impact that might have on the world\u2019s most populous continent and a region already fraught with very real geopolitical fault lines. Republican Senator Dan Sullivan requested not to discuss Trump during a meeting with journalists, instead directing reporters to a press release. \u201cThis is a very sad day for American and the rule of law,\u201d Sullivan\u2019s statement said, calling the verdict a \u201cgross abuse of our justice system.\u201d But speaking to journalists, the Senator from Alaska also celebrated what he called America\u2019s \u201ccommitment to liberty and democracy,\u201d saying this marked a competitive advantage over \u201cauthoritarian aggression led by China, Russia, Iran and North Korea.\u201d Sullivan was part of a bi-partisan delegation seeking to demonstrate Congressional commitment to US allies in Asia. \u201cThe dictators we are allied against\u2026are ally poor,\u201d Sullivan said. But there are clearly concerns about US reliability. An academic from Japan \u2013 Washington\u2019s closest ally in Asia \u2013 asked defense chiefs from Singapore and Malaysia about Trump\u2019s possible re-election.\u00a0 He called it a \u201cnightmare\u201d scenario. That triggered nervous laughter from the audience and on stage. Singapore\u2019s Dr. Ng Eng Hen gamely responded, \u201cwe will work with any administration in any country if we can find common ground.\u201d I vividly remember collective nervousness at the 2017 Shangri-La Dialogue, held just months after Trump\u2019s inauguration. Trump\u2019s then secretary of defense James Mattis clearly sought to reassure American defense partners worried about the new mercurial president. \u201cBear with us,\u201d Mattis told the audience, after being asked whether the \u201cAmerica First\u201d commander-in-chief would contribute to the destruction of the post-World War II order. \u201cOnce we\u2019ve exhausted all possible alternatives, the Americans will do the right thing.\u00a0 We will still be there.\u201d Seven years later, uncertainty over the political future of the US is just one of many challenges facing policy makers. One by one, the leaders of armies and navies shared their fears about climate change, nuclear proliferation, wars in Europe and the Middle East and concerns that a miscalculation between the US and Chinese militaries could spiral out of control \u201cThe world cannot withstand a third geopolitical shock,\u201d Singaporean defense chief Dr. Ng warned, after invoking the Gaza and Ukraine conflicts. In this tense geopolitical environment, it\u2019s far better for commanders to put on their dress uniforms and rub shoulders in the halls of a five-star hotel, than aim at each other over gun barrels on the battlefield.

{"id": "travel_worlds-50-best-restaurants-for-2024", "text": "Any doubts that Spain remains the fine dining center of the world may just have evaporated with the revealing of the World\u2019s 50 Best Restaurants for 2024 list. Six eateries from the European nation made the list \u2013 three of them in the top five. The awards\u00a0\u2013 considered the Oscars of global fine dining \u2013 were handed out at a ceremony at the Wynn in Las Vegas on Wednesday evening, with Barcelona\u2019s Disfrutar walking away with the top prize. Ranked number two last year, it\u2019s owned and run by chefs Oriol Castro, Eduard Xatruch and Mateu Casanas. The fact that this trio met while working at the legendary El Bulli should provide a few clues as to what diners can expect \u2013 imaginative and playful dishes executed with technical mastery, such as the caviar-filled Panchino doughnut, the frozen gazpacho sandwich and squab with kombu spaghetti, almond and grape. Coming in at number two was Asador Etxebarri of Atxondo, not far from the Spanish port city of Bilbao. Under the leadership of chef Victor Arguinzoniz, it\u2019s famed for offering unbeatable barbecue that lets the quality of the ingredients shine, such as a red Palam\u00f3s prawn that\u2019s simply grilled and served on its own. But you can never count Paris out.\u00a0The French capital\u2019s Table by Bruno Verjus\u00a0squeezed into third place, while yet another restaurant from Spain \u2013 Madrid\u2019s Diverxo \u2013 took the fourth spot. Coming in at fifth was Lima\u2019s Maido, one of three restaurants from the city to make the list, giving the Peruvian capital\u2019s reputation as South America\u2019s premier dining destination yet another boost. Mexico was the big winner in North America, earning three restaurants on the list, led by Mexico City eatery Quintonil, which came in seventh. The rest of the list Securing six restaurants on the list was enough to make Spain the biggest winner of the night in Vegas. In terms of cities, Paris and Bangkok tied for first, each with four restaurants on the list. Gaggan Anand, at number nine, was the Thai capital\u2019s top entry. As for the event\u2019s host country, the US had two restaurants on this year\u2019s 50 Best list. New York City\u2019s Atomix came in 6th this year, rising two spots since last year. SingleThread, in the town of Healdsburg in California\u2019s Sonoma Valley, landed in 47th place. Three restaurants from Tokyo were awarded, with eatery S\u00e9zanne\u00a0(voted Asia\u2019s best restaurant in 2024) ranking the highest in the Japanese capital, at 15. Hong Kong saw two of its restaurants hit the list, with both making impressive moves. Wing was the city\u2019s highest new entry on the entire list, at 20, while The Chairman was the highest climber, moving from last year\u2019s 50th spot into number 26. The list is compiled based on the votes of the\u00a0The World\u2019s 50 Best Restaurants Academy, which is made up of\u00a0 1,080 international restaurant industry experts including food writers and chefs, in 27 regions around the world. Restaurants can only win the top prize once, after which they\u2019re entered into a separate \u201cBest of the Best\u201d program. Members of that elite group include Geranium and Noma in Copenhagen, as well as New York\u2019s Eleven Madison Park, The Fat Duck near London, Osteria Francescana in Modena, Italy, and Mirazur in Menton, France. Last year\u2019s winner, Central of Lima, Peru, now joins them on that list. The world\u2019s 50 best restaurants 2024 1. Disfrutar\u00a0(Barcelona, Spain) 2.

{"id": "2024_06_05_weather_tornado-maryland-dc", "text": "Damaging storms and tornadoes hit parts of at least three states, including a Washington, DC, suburb Wednesday, killing at least one person and injuring others. A tornado ripped through the Detroit suburb of Livonia, Michigan, during the afternoon and toppled a tree onto a home, killing a 2-year-old and severely injuring the child\u2019s mother. \u201cThis is a terrible tragedy for our community,\u201d Livonia Mayor Maureen Miller Brosnan said in a\u00a0news release. \u201cOur hearts are broken, too, and we send our deepest sympathies.\u201d Storms intensified as they tracked through West Virginia and Maryland Wednesday evening and produced more than 10 reports of tornadoes in the two states. A tornado tracking through the Washington, DC, suburb of Gaithersburg, Maryland, trapped five people in a ranch-style home after it collapsed in the storm. One person was taken to a hospital with traumatic injuries, Montgomery County Fire and Rescue Assistant Chief David Pazos told CNN. Two other homes in the densely packed suburb with about 70,000 residents were significantly damaged by trees, according to the fire department\u2019s chief spokesperson Pete Piringer. Several people were removed from damaged structures and transported to hospitals, emergency officials said. A tornado was also seen near Baltimore, in Arbutus, Maryland at around 8:55 p.m. ET, the National Weather Service office there said. Details about what damage that tornado caused, if any, to structures were not immediately available. The US Storm Prediction Center said numerous trees and power lines were down in the area. In the Sykesville, Maryland, area, there were no immediate reports of injuries but at least 10 structures were damaged, mostly by the high winds, according to fire department spokesperson Bill Rehkopf. One was significantly damaged by a tree. Survey teams with the National Weather Service will visit the hard-hit areas to assess the damage to determine how many tornadoes there were and how strong they were. Weak tornadoes are not uncommon in the DC region, but only a handful in recorded history have been EF3 or stronger. In 2002, an F4 tornado devastated parts of La Plata, Maryland, south of DC. That storm killed three people and caused more than $100 million in damage, according to data from the National Weather Service. Tornadoes were also seen in Alabama and Ohio as storms across the country exceeded forecast expectations. A possible tornado also caused damage in Frazeysburg, Ohio, around 50 miles east of Columbus. Photos show debris littered streets, snapped power poles and some partially collapsed structures. Nine people were injured, including at least four taken to a nearby hospital, according to CNN affiliate WBNS.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/weather/tornado-maryland-dc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_04_10_style_graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers", "text": "Climbing up abandoned, unfinished floors and tightrope walking across balcony ledges, backpacks clanging with cans of alkyd and acrylic, a collective of Los Angeles graffiti artists have transformed their craft beyond urban aesthetics to champion community issues. Their choice of canvas: Oceanwide Plaza in Downtown LA. Occupying over a full square city block, the plaza was imagined as a vast mixed-use building project, offering city residents over 500 lavish condominiums, a five-star hotel, retail spaces, restaurants and a private 2-acre park. However, construction on the $1 billion project, which began in 2015, was shelved after the Chinese-backed contractor Oceanwide Holdings ran out of funding\u00a0in 2019 \u2014 and it has lain unfinished ever since. The plaza\u2019s status \u2014 and potential \u2014 as an eye-catching venue for their work spread by word of mouth within the graffiti community in recent months. Security at the site was known to be lax, an important detail as accessing the plaza\u2019s towers and other buildings constitutes trespassing. (The Los Angeles City Attorney confirmed to CNN that, as of April 3, criminal charges have been filed against 23 individuals, for violations including trespassing and possession of vandalism tools.) \u201cIt was like a gift from the graffiti gods\u2026 A giant canvas in the middle of downtown,\u201d tagger ENDEM told CNN, speaking on behalf of himself and his graffiti crew, NCT. \u201cWe were like, \u2018Let\u2019s do it right. Let\u2019s do it as if the whole world is going to see this.\u2019\u201d Historically, graffiti has often been used as protest art. While the practice dates back thousands of years, it\u2019s most commonly viewed in a contemporary context (within graffiti\u2019s \u201cmodern\u201d era, which dates back to the 1960s and 70s) as a creative vehicle for challenging societal norms and inequities \u2014 whether on the Berlin Wall in Germany or subway cars in New York City; whether painted by anonymous artists or well-known figures like Keith Haring or Banksy, even if the latter is, technically, anonymous himself. Still, neither ENDEM nor any of the other artists involved realized how famous their work on the Oceanside towers would become. Sharing his artwork on Instagram on January 31, a video from ENDEM quickly racked up tens of thousands of views: Vibrant images of bright block lettering splayed across the building\u2019s exterior paired with footage from the inside \u2014 the artist posing with shots of his spray paint cans, poised above the cityscape. The viral footage, among other visuals shared on social media, quickly opened the floodgates. Hitting Oceanside became a mark of credibility in the graffiti world; by mid-February, the number of tags and other graffiti pieces there were multiplying overnight. \u201cIt was an open house people going in and out. It was beautiful. It was like graffiti paradise,\u201d ENDEM said. \u201cIt felt exactly like the streets, but concentrated.\u201d Transformed in part into an art installation, Oceanwide became an opportunity for the graffiti artists to leave a message to the city below, and a call-out to policy makers who leave buildings to rot. \u201cGraffiti shows you where the city hurts,\u201d Roger Gastman, owner and founder of the LA-based arts organization Beyond the Streets, told CNN. Renowned for its large-scale exhibitions, immersive educational programs, pop-up events and partnerships, Beyond the Streets works to educate and celebrate the diverse dimensions of graffiti as a medium. To him, the mission of graffiti is clear: to challenge, educate, and redefine public perception of the medium. Earl Ofari Hutchinson, president of The Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable, a nonpartisan public policy forum\u00a0for civic participation and education,\u00a0sees the abandoned towers as amplifying the social issues of the community they are situated in, connecting the graffiti-laden structures to the urban blight that surrounds them in LA\u2019s Skid Row. Skid Row is a 50-block sector of downtown LA where between 8,000 and 11,000 unhoused people live in challenging, often squalid conditions. \u201cYou\u2019ve got tens of thousands of people displaced because of over urban development. And as a result of that, they\u2019re on the streets,\u201d Hutchinson told CNN, noting that the homeless population in Los Angeles is continuing to grow. (The Los Angeles Housing Services Authority reports a 9% increase in homelessness in LA county in 2023 and a 10% increase in the city from 2022.) \u201cNow, set right in the middle of that, you have\u2026 a development that will never be completed.\u201d \u201cWhat you have here is a classic urban nightmare brought on by very poor policies \u2014 fiscal, financial, budgetary and political problems (in) a city that has just gone off the rails in terms of over-development and lack of affordability,\u201d Hutchinson added. Still, Hutchinson is no fan of the graffiti either. To him, and many other LA residents who have said they disapprove of the \u201cvandalism,\u201d the plaza is a sore sight for eyes. \u201cThe problem is you\u2019re talking about violating public space and with no permission\u2026 that doesn\u2019t fly with me,\u201d Hutchinson said. \u201cThe fact of the matter is, the public has not given you approval. (And) the general public has to pay for the removal.\u201d Costs currently borne by the taxpayer at the Oceanwide Plaza site include the security details provided by the LAPD as well as the graffiti cleanup Hutchinson highlights. (\u201cThis has strained our deployment,\u201d LAPD Chief Michel Moore said during a February meeting of the Los Angeles City Council. \u201cWe have called in some officers on an overtime basis so that we can provide for these added patrols or station them at that site to deter vandals and others from gaining access.\u201d) Clean teams working in the neighborhoods surrounding Oceanwide remove on average some 2,000 square feet of graffiti per week, with that figure growing in recent months. \u201cPeople forget that people live here. People own businesses here and they don\u2019t want to have to spend the time and money to clean it up,\u201d said Blair Besten, executive director of the Historic Core of Downtown Los Angeles, an organization which works to improve the quality of life in downtown neighborhoods. The Historic Core prioritizes street sweeping, trash collection \u2014 and graffiti removal. \u201cI would hardly call what they\u2019re doing art,\u201d Besten argued of the Oceanwide taggers. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty sloppy and quick. They come in fast and they knock it out and they leave.\u201d But to Gastman, graffiti is a powerful form of expression, and a call-to-action \u2014 particularly for those who emanate from struggles within home life, gang life or societal turmoil. Graffiti culture can offer an unexpected support system for those the city has abandoned, Gastman said. It becomes a platform for them to make their voices heard. \u201cIn graffiti culture, a lot of us know each other. We\u2019re all friends. We have the same mentality \u2014 we\u2019re just trying to get up. We\u2019re just trying to get noticed,\u201d explained ENDEM. In the midst of an addiction that led to his rock bottom, graffiti became his lifeline, he explained. \u201cI was at my lowest of lows, still trying to stay sober, I needed some type of outlet,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cGraffiti is something that you can hold on to. Its bigger than me, its everyone, it\u2019s a community.\u201d In this, ENDEM believes that the beauty of Oceanwide isn\u2019t tangible. Rather, it lies in the birth of a new generation of graffiti writers. \u201cThey can erase the graffiti on buildings, but they can never erase the impact that it has on the city of Los Angeles and the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to it. Yes, it\u2019s vandalism. Yes, it\u2019s art, and it\u2019s everything in between,\u201d Gastman concluded. \u201cThis is a real culture. It\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/10/style/graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "world"}}

Nelson Mandela\u2019s party suffered a seismic blow at the polls, final election results announced on Sunday confirmed. Support for the ANC dropped to 40.18%, a huge slump from the 57.5% it received in the last election in 2019. The official opposition party, the centrist Democratic Alliance (DA), received 21.8% of the vote. Former President Jacob Zuma\u2019s newly formed uMkhonto weSizwe Party (MK) had nearly 14.59% of the vote. Another ANC splinter party \u2013 the far-left Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) \u2013 had nearly 10%, with results at 9.52% The blow to the ANC comes after\u00a0years of corruption scandals and economic mismanagement.\u00a0\u00a0As a result,\u00a0the ANC will be forced to form a coalition to govern\u00a0the world\u2019s most unequal country. Cyril Ramaphosa, the president of South Africa and the ANC \u2013 and once Mandela\u2019s favorite to succeed him as leader \u2013 promised a \u201cnew dawn\u201d when he took over in 2018 from disgraced former president Jacob Zuma. But many feel those promises never\u00a0materialized\u00a0and the\u00a0election\u00a0results reflect\u00a0a population deeply frustrated with the country\u2019s direction. South Africans could now face weeks of political uncertainty, as the ANC seeks to strike a coalition deal with former rivals. \u201cOur people have spoken, whether we like it or not they have spoken,\u201d Ramaphosa told an audience after the official results were announced. He added that the voices of the people had been \u201cheard\u201d and \u201cwe must respect their choices and their wishes.\u201d The\u00a0rebuke to the ANC\u00a0was hardly unexpected,\u00a0mirroring widespread dissatisfaction with the ruling party.\u00a0But the scale of the losses surprised some. \u201cWhat we have seen is voters are unhappy with the ANC\u2019s recent history. In particular\u00a0what happened in the Zuma years and what followed on from that,\u201d analyst and former ANC MP Melanie Verwoerd told CNN. There has been \u201ca general arrogance and loss of connection with the general voter from the ANC side,\u201d Verwoerd said, adding that parties like MK and the EFF have capitalized on\u00a0that discontent. Zuma \u2013 a fierce critic of Ramaphosa \u2013 was forced to\u00a0resign as leader in 2018\u00a0and served a brief stint in jail in 2021 for contempt of court.\u00a0The Constitutional Court barred the\u00a082-year-old\u00a0from running for parliament\u00a0in May, but\u00a0his face remained on the MK party ballot. The results from Wednesday\u2019s poll were officially announced despite protests from Zuma and his MK party. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer a recount. We want a total revote,\u201d the party\u2019s spokesperson Nhlamulo Ndhlela said Saturday evening. Zuma told a press briefing the party wanted a chance to present its case before the results were announced. South Africa\u2019s electoral commission had already extended the deadline for submissions of objections and appeals to 6 p.m. local time on Saturday. It received more than 500 objections. ANC in uncharted territory Substantial bargaining for the coalition government will now begin.\u00a0Political parties will have two weeks to form a coalition before a new parliament must convene to elect the nation\u2019s president.\u00a0If they fail, new elections will need to be held. ANC Secretary-General Fikile Mbalula admitted Sunday there was \u201cnothing to celebrate\u201d following the party\u2019s blow at the polls. \u201cWe wish to assure the people of South Africa that we have heard them. We have heard their concerns, their frustrations and their dissatisfaction,\u201d Mbalula told a media briefing. However, he warned potential coalition partners if they demand party leader Ramaphosa must step down \u201cthis is not going to happen.\u201d DA leader John Steenhuisen told CNN during an interview at the election\u2019s National Results Center that he had \u201cno sympathy for Mr. Ramaphosa and his party.\u201d \u201cIt is their spinelessness to deal with the prospect of Mr. Zuma and his sins of omission and commission that has led to him being a political force now that has come and wiped them out in places like KwaZulu-Natal and other parts of the country.\u201d The populous coastal eastern province of KwaZulu-Natal, where the major city of Durban is located and which is Zuma\u2019s home province, has traditionally been a stronghold of the conservative Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP). This time around, the MK party earned almost 46% of the provincial vote, but failed to get a majority and will be forced to find a coalition partner if it wants to govern the province. Zuma has faced\u00a0hundreds of corruption, fraud and racketeering charges\u00a0over the years. He has always denied all of them and became known as the \u201cTeflon President\u201d because few politicians could have survived the scandals he has faced and weathered. Analysts CNN spoke to, including Verwoerd,\u00a0believe the most likely coalition is between the ANC and DA. But others are more sceptical of that outcome.\u00a0They all agree that the country is in uncharted territory. Steenhuisen told CNN he wants to be part of a governing coalition and he believes a coalition \u201ccan work.\u201d Before\u00a0the election, the DA had already formed a\u00a0bloc with smaller opposition parties called the Multi-Party Charter. What he labels a \u201cdoomsday coalition\u201d is one of the other options on the table: a deal between the ANC-EFF\u00a0or\u00a0even\u00a0the\u00a0MK. But with such disdain inside those breakaway parties for\u00a0Ramaphosa, it would be quite some negotiation. The EFF is led by\u00a0former ANC youth leader Julius Malema. It espouses the expropriation of land without compensation and sweeping state nationalism.\u00a0The MK party\u2019s manifesto\u00a0holds\u00a0broadly\u00a0similar ideas and demands\u00a0an overhaul of the country\u2019s constitution\u00a0to restore more powers to traditional leaders. Not since the dawn of democracy in 1994 has South Africa\u2019s political landscape been so unclear. But\u00a0some analysts believe \u2013 despite the uncertainty \u2013\u00a0that\u00a0the results of this election could be a win for democracy. \u201cIt\u00a0is probably a maturity in the democracy, we needed change and it is never good to have such a one-party dominance in a country,\u201d Verwoerd said. \u201cIt might be a little bit more unstable as we go into the future. But for\u00a0democracy\u2019s\u00a0sake, it is most probably a good thing.\u201d Ramaphosa appeared to make a similar point in his post results speech, saying the announcement \u201cin many ways represents a victory for our democracy as South Africans. It also represents a victory of our constitutional order\u201d and a \u201cvictory for all the people of South Africa.\u201d Verwoerd said that the ANC\u2019s prospects dropped dramatically under the previous president. \u201cOnce the Jacob Zuma years happened, it became pretty inevitable that there was going to be a slide,\u201d she added. A country going backwards The ANC swept to power in 1994 on a\u00a0pledge\u00a0to \u201cbuild a better life for all,\u201d winning almost 63% of the vote in the country\u2019s first democratic election. Fast forward three decades and rampant corruption, soaring joblessness, crippling\u00a0power cuts,\u00a0and feeble economic growth are severely impacting South Africans. The economy has gone backward over the past decade, evidenced by a sharp fall in living standards. According to the\u00a0World Bank, gross domestic product per capita has fallen from a peak in 2011, leaving the average South African 23% poorer. South Africa has the highest rate of unemployment in the world, according to\u00a0the\u00a0World Bank. \u00a0Inequality is also the world\u2019s worst. Black South Africans, who make up 81% of the population, are at the sharp end of this dire situation. Unemployment and poverty remain concentrated in the Black majority, in large part due to the\u00a0failure of public schooling, while most White South Africans have jobs and command considerably higher wages. Any coalition government will\u00a0be a bitter pill to swallow for the ANC and Ramaphosa,\u00a0who could soon be fighting for his political life. Leading analysts believe that the ANC was depending on its legacy too much. \u201cThe ANC was campaigning on three decades of its existence. But nobody was looking at the current president,\u201d said TK Pooe, a senior lecturer at Wits School of Governance in Johannesburg. He believes Ramaphosa is \u201cunder pressure\u201d. \u201cHistorically, it is an embarrassment for him. He always styles himself as the next Nelson Mandela,\u201d Pooe told CNN. But \u201clast recollection, Nelson Mandela never lost an election.\u201d Pooe said, with this election, voters have told the ANC three things: \u201cjobs, jobs, jobs.\u201d Whether a coalition government can deliver for the people is deeply uncertain, but one thing is clear:\u00a0South Africa and the ANC \u2013 Mandela\u2019s former liberation movement that triumphed over apartheid \u2013 will never be the same.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/africa/south-africa-election-results-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_middleeast_turkey-israel-hamas-war-politics-mime-intl", "text": "Since the war in Gaza began, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been one of Israel\u2019s harshest and most vocal critics \u2013 routinely branding it a terror state, comparing its prime minister to Hitler and heaping praise on Hamas. The Palestinian militant group is considered a terror group by most members of NATO, but not Turkey. Some Western critics might accuse Erdogan of going too far in supporting Hamas, but recent events suggest he has not yet appeased his domestic political base. After Erdogan\u2019s ruling party was handed a humbling defeat in local elections in March, he promised to think hard about what went wrong. Beyond the sputtering Turkish economy \u2013 many pundits blamed the electoral setback on his stance on Israel and its war in Gaza. Political challengers, like the smaller, ultra-conservative New Welfare party, managed to siphon off votes from the president\u2019s ruling AK Party by taking a tougher stance against Israel and demanding concrete actions beyond the fiery rhetoric Erdogan is known for. \u201cWe do not see (the government) doing anything other than speaking and condemning. There are no sanctions, no concrete steps taken, trade with Israel still continues,\u201d said New Welfare\u2019s leader Fatih Erbakan in March. The president may have believed that strong rhetoric against Israel was enough, Seda Demiralp, a political scientist at Isik University, told CNN after the election. \u201cErdogan really underestimated New Welfare and how much New Welfare could mobilize conservative voters.\u201d Correcting course After the election, Erdogan wasted little time correcting course, swiftly moving to match words with actions. In a matter of days, some trade with Israel was cut off. Three weeks later, all trade was cut off. Some $7 billion worth of annual trade \u2013 mostly Turkish exports \u2013 is now on pause until the war is over. That wasn\u2019t all. Last month, Turkey announced its intention to join the genocide case against Israel at the International Court of Justice. Already warm ties with Hamas were made even warmer when Erdogan hosted the group\u2019s political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Istanbul on April 20, and posed with him for pictures. Erdogan has compared Hamas to the \u201cKuvayi Milliye,\u201d the nationalist militias that fought against foreign occupation during the Turkish War of Independence after World War I. \u201cBelieve me, if it were 100 years ago, they would also call Kuvayi Milliye a terrorist organization, a rebel, a joke, a traitor,\u201d Erdogan said in a speech to party lawmakers in May, according to state broadcaster TRT. \u201cThis nation has always stood by the oppressed.\u201d The gap between how Turkey and its NATO allies view Hamas was on full, awkward display when Erdogan hosted Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis last month in Ankara. \u201cI don\u2019t see Hamas as a terrorist organization,\u201d Erdogan declared. \u201cOn the contrary, Hamas is an organization of resistance, whose territories have been occupied since 1947 and which has been defending its territories after the occupation\u2026 If you call them a \u2018terrorist organization,\u2019 it will upset us.\u201d \u201cWe can agree to disagree on this topic,\u201d Mitsotakis replied. Erdogan went on to claim that \u201cover 1,000 Hamas members are now under treatment in our hospitals in Turkey.\u201d A Turkish official with knowledge of the situation has since told CNN the president misspoke.\u00a0\u201cHe meant 1,000 Gazans are under treatment, who aren\u2019t Hamas members,\u201d the official said. Since the war began, the Turkish Ministry of Health has made several medical airlifts of injured Gazans and their family members to hospitals in Turkey. For Erdogan, \u2018Hamas is Palestine\u2019 Experts say the comment made by Erdogan in the presence of the Greek leader may have in fact been intended for an audience closer to home. \u201cWestern leaders right now are very aware that Erdogan is basically talking for his domestic audience and for the Muslim neighborhood,\u201d said Evren Balta, an international relations professor at Ozyegin University in Istanbul. Domestically, she said, the president has managed to link Hamas and the Palestinians to the point that \u201cwhen you are criticizing Hamas publicly, it is as if you\u2019re criticizing the Palestinian cause.\u201d That, coupled with the strong affinity the Turkish public has with Palestinians, has led politicians of all stripes to tread carefully on the issue, particularly some secular and nationalist opposition parties. \u201cFor Erdogan, Hamas is Palestine. For the opposition, Hamas is not Palestine, but they are having difficulties framing the political discourse,\u201d Balta said. At a political rally ahead of the March local elections, Ozgur Ozel, leader of the secular CHP party established by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of modern Turkey, highlighted his party\u2019s longstanding support for the Palestinian cause and sought to counter claims that he regards Hamas as a terrorist organization. \u201cI have not called Hamas a terrorist organization, but I have condemned its terrorist attacks,\u201d he said. \u201cI also condemned Israel\u2019s state terrorism.\u201d He then went on to taunt the president. \u201cNow come on, Erdogan. If you are on Palestine\u2019s side, stop the trade that your relatives, children, supporters and friends do with Israel every day.\u201d After the elections, Istanbul\u2019s CHP mayor Ekrem Imamoglu \u2013 widely touted as a future presidential contender \u2013 took fierce criticism from political rivals and in the Turkish press for branding Hamas as a terrorist organization in an interview with CNN in April. This was despite his harsh condemnation of Israel and its \u201cbrutal oppression\u201d of Palestinians. \u2018No influence\u2019 on NATO Turkey\u2019s NATO allies in the West have been quick to condemn Hamas, but they\u2019ve been largely silent on Ankara\u2019s cozy relations with the group. \u201cI think there is a degree of discomfort,\u201d about the relationship, said Fabrice Pothier, a former NATO policy chief, who now leads the Rasmussen Global political consultancy. \u201cIt is not benign, that there is one major ally that is far away from the others, but I think NATO manages \u2013 up to a point \u2013 to compartmentalize between the bilateral positions or issues of allies, and the NATO collective positions and issues.\u201d A case in point, in October, NATO leader Jens Stoltenberg told the German Press Agency that Turkey-Hamas relations are not a problem because \u201cin some ways it has no influence on what we do or don\u2019t do because we don\u2019t play a role in this particular conflict.\u201d Hamas members can freely come and go from Turkey and have a regular presence in the country. In fact, in December, Erdogan\u2019s chief foreign policy and security adviser, Akif Cagatay Kilic told CNN that Hamas\u2019 political leader Haniyeh \u201cmight have been\u201d in Turkey on October 7, the day the militant group led an attack on Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking 250 hostages. But he claimed that historically, Turkey\u2019s relationship with Hamas hasn\u2019t merely been tolerated by Israel, but has even been encouraged. He said former Turkish leaders \u201chave been asked \u2013 even by (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu \u2013 to engage with Hamas.\u201d Turkey\u2019s aim is to bring peace to the region, he said. \u201cWe\u2019re doing whatever it takes to achieve that.\u201d \u2018Inflation of mediators\u2019 Although it isn\u2019t officially a mediator in the Gaza conflict, there are indications that Ankara is involved on some level. In April, Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said Hamas was willing to dissolve its military wing if a Palestinian state was created within the 1967 borders. This was later confirmed by an Istanbul-based Hamas member, marking the first time the group has offered to lay down its arms. Fidan also helped relay messages between Washington and Tehran ahead of Iran\u2019s barrage of missiles fired at Israel in April, and there is some indication that Ankara may be playing a similar conduit role between Washington and Hamas. \u201cWe have been in touch with both the US and Hamas. We have been advising and encouraging both sides for an immediate and permanent ceasefire,\u201d a Turkish official told CNN \u2013 pointing to calls that Fidan held with both Haniyeh and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on the same day in mid-May. With Qatar mulling a possible exit from its mediation role, Balta says Turkey could potentially help fill the gap, despite its Hamas ties increasing distrust with Israel and the West. But, she says, the West would much prefer to deal with Turkey than with, say, Iran, which could become a future refuge for Hamas leaders if the group is forced to leave Qatar, where its political office is based. \u201cWestern governments know how to deal with Turkey\u2026 so when it comes to Middle Eastern conflicts, who else is going to be a reliable partner? Really, there are not many other reliable partners,\u201d she said. For now, Turkey isn\u2019t interested in playing a formal role in trying to bring an end to the war in Gaza. \u201cWe do not want to create an inflation of mediators,\u201d a Turkish Foreign Ministry source told CNN in April. Despite some discomfort with Turkey\u2019s close ties to Hamas, Western states, Pothier believes, figure it\u2019s better just to tolerate it. \u201cI think the West is finding it useful to have countries who can be between us and Hamas,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/middleeast/turkey-israel-hamas-war-politics-mime-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_06_middleeast_israel-hezbollah-lebanon-tensions-escalate-explainer-intl", "text": "Israel and the Lebanese Iran-backed Islamist group Hezbollah are ramping up cross-border attacks after months of low-intensity fighting, prompting the Israeli military to warn this week that it is prepared to launch a large-scale attack on its northern border. With both sides trading fire for more than eight months, experts say Israel feels it can no longer ignore its northern front or delay taking action there. A full-blown war appears to have become more likely \u2013 even if both sides have no desire for one, analysts believe. Here\u2019s what we know: Why are Israel and Hezbollah fighting? Lebanon and Israel have officially been in a state of war for decades. Israel launched a devastating invasion of Lebanon in 1982, sending tanks all the way to the capital Beirut,\u00a0after coming under attack from Palestinian militants in the country. It then occupied southern Lebanon for 22 years until it was driven out by Hezbollah in 2000. In Lebanon, Hezbollah is officially considered a \u201cresistance\u201d group tasked with confronting Israel, which Beirut classifies as an enemy state. Much of the Western world has designated Hezbollah a terrorist organization. Since then, the two sides have traded fire sporadically, but tensions boiled over in 2006 when Israel went to war in southern Lebanon after Hezbollah kidnapped two Israeli soldiers. More than 1,000 Lebanese were killed in that conflict, mostly civilians, as well as 49 Israeli civilians and 121 soldiers. Two years later, Hezbollah returned the remains of the kidnapped soldiers in exchange for the release of Lebanese and Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails, as well as the bodies of militants Israel was holding. The latest hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah started after Hamas led an attack on Israel on October 7, killing 1,200 people and abducting 250, according to Israeli authorities. That prompted Israel to go to war with Hamas in Gaza, during which it has levelled much of the territory and killed more than 36,000 Palestinians. Hezbollah has said that its current round of fighting with Israel is to support the Palestinians in Gaza. The military capability of the Lebanese group has grown since 2006, when it relied largely on inaccurate Soviet-era Katyusha rockets. Today, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah says his group boasts more than 100,000 fighters and reservists. The group is also believed to possess 150,000 rockets that could overwhelm Israel\u2019s defenses if an all-out war breaks out. Why are tensions flaring up now? The conflict between Israel and Hezbollah has been gradually intensifying since October 8, said Heiko Wimmen, project director for Iraq, Syria and Lebanon at the International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based think tank. It\u2019s a \u201cslow-motion escalation\u201d that \u201cinches upwards,\u201d he said. But both sides have come closer to war of late as clashes across the border have grown in number and scale. \u201cThere is clearly an escalation,\u201d said Wimmen, particularly in terms of deaths on each side of the border and the type of weaponry Hezbollah has been deploying. An Israeli reservist was killed in a Hezbollah strike on a village in northern Israel on Wednesday, bringing the total number of soldiers killed on the Israeli side to 19. Israel and Hezbollah have also been striking much deeper into each other\u2019s territory than they were at the beginning of the war, when fighting was confined to a roughly 4-kilometer (2.5-mile) radius of the border on either side. Hezbollah has fired 35 kilometers into Israel, while Israel has targeted areas of Lebanon more than 120 kilometers north. Cross-border attacks from Lebanon this week led to large fires blazing through Israel\u2019s northern region,\u00a0which Israel attributed to rocket fire from southern Lebanon, where Hezbollah said it had launched a \u201cswarm of drones\u201d at Israeli military sites. On Wednesday Hezbollah said it had targeted Israel\u2019s Iron Dome defense system in the northern village of Ramot Naftali, using a guided missile. Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Lt. Col. Peter Lerner told a briefing Thursday: \u201cI can\u2019t confirm that at this stage. I can\u2019t confirm that this happened at all.\u201d Amal Saad, a lecturer at Cardiff University and an expert on Hezbollah, said the group\u2019s escalation \u201cis a marked departure from prior flare-ups that have occurred since October 8.\u201d \u201cThis stage transcends merely responding to Israeli attacks and restoring deterrence; it involves conveying new messages and strategies,\u201d Saad wrote on X. The conflict has become \u201cvery visible\u201d and \u201cdifficult to ignore,\u201d said Wimmen, of the International Crisis Group, adding that Israeli officials feel compelled to respond, or at least be seen as responding, amid pressure to react from far-right ministers in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government. There is a push within government and the Israeli army to take action in the north, Ronni Shaked, a scholar at the Truman Institute at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, told CNN. \u201cNobody can live in this situation.\u201d What are both sides saying? Rhetoric has been fiery from both sides, but experts say neither side wants a full-blown conflict. Netanyahu in December warned that Beirut would turn into Gaza if Hezbollah chose to start an all-out war. But Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich this week poured cold water on the prospect of a wider war, saying the IDF isn\u2019t interested in broadening the war to eliminate Hezbollah. The military is \u201ctelling us right now that it doesn\u2019t want to\u2026 launch an attack in the north, fight and defeat Hezbollah, and overwhelm it and create a security zone.\u201d During his visit to the northern city of Kiryat Shmona near the Lebanese border on Wednesday, Netanyahu said Israel was prepared for \u201cvery intense action\u201d in the north. \u201cWhoever thinks that they can hurt us and that we will sit idly by is making a big mistake,\u201d the prime minister said. \u201cOne way or another, we will restore security to the north.\u201d Naim Qassem, Hezbollah\u2019s second-in-command, told Al Jazeera on Tuesday that the group had assessed that recent threats from Israel were not serious. \u201cEither way, we have decided not to widen the battle and we do not want an all-out war. But if it is imposed on us, we are ready and we won\u2019t retreat,\u201d Qassem said, adding that Hezbollah will end its attacks on Israel once the war in Gaza stops. Is a full-blown war likely? Experts say that while both sides may not choose to start an all-out war, their escalatory actions may still trigger one inadvertently. Wimmen of the International Crisis Group said that Israel and Hezbollah are unlikely to take a conscious decision to start a war. However, the more intense the conflict becomes, the deeper each side strikes into the other\u2019s territory and the heavier the weapons used, the more likely it is that \u201csomething goes wrong,\u201d he said. Netanyahu is under intense pressure from the opposition and members of his coalition to take action in the north, especially given that so many Israelis have been displaced from the area. More than 53,000 Israelis have been forced to leave their homes in the north, the IDF said. In Lebanon, more than 94,000 people have been displaced from areas and towns near the border with Israel since the conflict started, according to figures released Tuesday by the Lebanese Ministry of Public Health. \u201cAll Hezbollah strongholds must be burned and destroyed. War!\u201d said Israeli far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir in a statement this week. Opposition leader Yair Lapid also slammed the government, saying: \u201cThe north goes up in flames and Israeli deterrence burns with it. \u201cThe government has no plan for the day after in Gaza, no plan to return the residents to the north, no management, no strategy. A government of total abandonment,\u201d Lapid said on X. The US has cautioned against escalation, worried it might spin out of control. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Wednesday the United States is \u201cincredibly concerned\u201d about the risk of escalation, adding that the Biden administration is engaged in diplomatic conversations \u201cto try to avoid that conflict from escalating beyond control.\u201d Shaked, the Truman Institute scholar, said that despite Hezbollah\u2019s assertions that its attacks on Israel are in support of Gaza, the group\u2019s strategy is likely to be closely coordinated with its closest ally Iran \u2013 especially with so much at stake.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-lebanon-tensions-escalate-explainer-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_06_03_africa_nigerian-workers-declare-nationwide-strike-intl", "text": "A nationwide strike in Nigeria brought air travel to a standstill and plunged the country into darkness on Monday as union workers stormed the national grid and shut down the nation\u2019s power supply, according to the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN). Tens of millions are without power and flights have been disrupted, as the Nigerian Labor Congress (NLC) and the Trade Union Congress (TUC) initiated an indefinite strike. Operators from TCN were beaten and injured while they were forcibly removed from control rooms, the company said. Cane-swinging\u00a0union workers were also seen in photos circulating on social media Monday ordering personnel of the country\u2019s tax agency out of their offices. This strike comes after failed negotiations with the government to raise the federal minimum wage. The unions are also protesting a recent hike in electricity tariffs. The unions\u2019 demands include raising the minimum wage from 30,000 naira ($22.4) to 494,000 naira ($369.6). Presidential aide Bayo Onanuga dismissed these demands as \u201cunreasonable,\u201d in a post on the social media platform X. The government had proposed a 100% increase to 60,000 naira ($44.89), which the unions rejected, seeking a 1,547% increase instead, Onanuga added. Despite being Africa\u2019s fourth-largest economy, Nigeria\u2019s minimum wage is not among the continent\u2019s top ten, lagging far behind countries like Seychelles, where workers receive a minimum wage of $465.4 monthly. Health care system disrupted The strike has severely affected travel, leaving passengers stranded at major airports in Lagos and Abuja. Airport workers confirmed to CNN that all incoming and outgoing flights have been grounded, further compounding the crisis. Healthcare services have also been severely impacted, a Nigerian doctor Olusina Ajidahun told CNN. \u201cI\u2019m worried because the state of the healthcare system is on the verge of collapse,\u201d he said, adding that his medical facility located in southwest Nigeria was unable to power crucial hospital equipment due to the shutdown of the national grid. \u201cComing in the morning, the emergency (unit) and everywhere was dark. Patients and healthcare workers were all in darkness.\u201d Nigerian Justice Minister Lateef Fagbemi has declared the strike illegal in a letter to the labor unions, calling it \u201cpremature and ineffectual,\u201d in a statement posted by Onanuga. The strike has elicited mixed reactions from Nigerians on social media, with some declaring support, others saying it is detrimental to citizens. \u201cI support the strike action by the NLC. 30k or 60k minimum wage in 2024 Nigeria is unsustainable and unacceptable,\u201d wrote lawyer Festus Ogun in a post on X. \u201cThe NLC should refrain from actions that punish the common man \u2013 the average Nigerian. Electricity, roads, airports and other critical infrastructure should be left to function as normal,\u201d argued management consultant Dipo Awojide. Controversial expenditure Nigeria faces numerous economic challenges, including the devaluation of its currency which has dropped to record lows in recent months, as well as a cost-of-living crisis marked by soaring prices for food, transport, and health care. Inflation has reached 33.69%, according to the country\u2019s data office, the highest in nearly three decades. President Bola Tinubu\u2019s administration has faced criticism for controversial spending of public funds which has fueled public anger. Last month, the president approved a 90 billion-naira ($67 million) subsidy for Muslims attending the Hajj pilgrimage, and previously, he authorized multimillion-dollar budgets for luxury SUVs and renovations for presidential residences, as well as vehicles for the First Lady\u2019s office, which is not formally recognized under Nigerian law. Presidential spokesman Ajuri Ngelale admitted that the current wage is \u201cunsustainably low\u201d but warned that the unions\u2019 proposed increase would have severe economic consequences, including significantly higher school fees and potential mass retrenchment if schools and other institutions cannot afford the increased wages. \u201cNigerian parents will now have to grapple with school fees that are 10 times more than what they are paying today \u2026 you are going to mandate schools to pay cooks, janitors, and others 20 times more in wages?\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/africa/nigerian-workers-declare-nationwide-strike-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_30_asia_japan-whaling-mothership-kangei-maru-intl-hnk", "text": "Wearing a toy whale hat, whale tie and a whale motif shirt, Hideki Tokoro spends much of his days thinking about the world\u2019s largest mammals. But he doesn\u2019t want to protect them. He wants to hunt them. To do that his company Kyodo Senpaku has built and launched a brand-new whaling $48 million \u201cmothership\u201d \u2013 the Kangei Maru. \u201cWe are proud of catching whales and are very proud of this ship which will allow us to begin offshore mothership-style whaling this year,\u201d Tokoro told reporters as he escorted them around the 370-foot, 9,300-ton vessel that set sail last Saturday for an eight-month tour of the country\u2019s northern waters. The new ship replaces the Nisshin Maru, the infamous whaling factory vessel dubbed by activists as a \u201cfloating slaughterhouse\u201d that was decommissioned in 2020 after more than 30 years of service, during which it frequently clashed with anti-whaling activists. The Kangei Maru is bigger and faster than its predecessor, the company says, and is equipped with state-of-the-art drones able to travel a reported 100 kilometers (62 miles) to allow crews of smaller boats to quickly locate and kill whales. But some activists say the ship\u2019s high-powered features, including a cruising range of 13,000 kilometers (more than 8,000 miles) and its ability to sail for up to 60 days, suggests that Japan could set its sights on whales far beyond its northern waters. \u201cJapan has never given up on its whaling ambitions,\u201d veteran anti-whaling activist Paul Watson told CNN. \u201cThe only purpose of a vessel like that is so it can travel long distances to the Southern Ocean to hunt whales, (and) what the whalers are doing right now is really just a test run. They are testing out the new ship in their waters.\u201d \u2018We need to cull whales\u2019 The Kangei Maru boasts a slipway large enough to haul 85-foot whales from the sea that leads to an indoor flensing deck the size\u00a0of two basketball courts. There, workers will strip away the blubber before cutting up the whale flesh on enormous cutting boards, before vacuum-packing and storing the meat in 40 industrial freezers, ready for sale. \u201cWhales are at the top of the food chain. They compete with humans by eating marine creatures that should be feeding other fish,\u201d Tokoro said on the tour. \u201cWe need to cull whales to keep the balance of the ecosystem \u2013 it\u2019s our job and mission to protect oceans for the future.\u201d He also told CNN that most of the ship\u2019s catch would be killed \u201calmost instantly\u201d by cannons at sea. \u201cWe aim for perfection, but some of them may suffer. In such cases, we will use a rifle to finish the job.\u201d Besides objecting to the slaughter one of the ocean\u2019s most majestic creatures, marine conservation groups and scientists have highlighted the important role which whales play in helping to tackle the climate crisis through sequestering and storing planet-heating carbon emissions. \u201cWhales are not just consumers in ocean eco-systems \u2013 they recycle a ton of nutrients into the environment which helps stimulate plant-life growth,\u201d\u00a0said marine ecologist Ari Friedlaender, also rejecting pro-whaling arguments that commercial hunts could be \u201csustainable.\u201d \u201cHumans have a very long history of killing whales and have not done a good job of being able to sustainably harvest animals,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no way to sustainably harvest a wild animal like that.\u201d Why is Japan so determined to keep whaling? Commercial whaling was banned in 1986 under a moratorium by the International Whaling Commission (IWC) after whale populations were almost driven to extinction by humans. Japan is one of three countries \u2013 along with Norway and Iceland \u2013 that continues to hunt whales, and officials argue that the industry is an important part of its culture and history \u2013 and also provides food security. Iceland, which has fiercely defended commercial whaling, said it would end whaling in 2024, citing falling demand for whale meat as well as \u201chigh operation costs and little proof of any economic advantage.\u201d Commercial whaling continues in Norway, which experts say has quietly become the world\u2019s leading whaling nation \u2013 killing more whales than Japan and Iceland combined. For decades, Japan has justified whaling under the guise of \u201cscientific research.\u201d In 2018, it tried one last time to persuade the IWC to allow it to resume commercial whaling \u2013 and failed. So, it withdrew from the body and resumed commercial whaling months later, in defiance of international criticism. \u201cJapan is no longer party to the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling and can argue that it is no longer bound by provisions and constraints,\u201d Donald Rothwell, an international law professor at the Australian National University (ANU), told CNN. \u201cWithin its waters, it\u00a0has the absolute authority to control the management of living resources \u2013 and that includes whales.\u201d Under Japanese law, three species of whale are permitted to be hunted in its territorial waters and exclusive economic zones \u2013 endangered sei whales and threatened minke whales and Bryde\u2019s whales, with endangered fin whales set to be added to kill lists. \u201cWhales are important food resources and should be sustainably utilized based on scientific evidence,\u201d said government spokesperson Yoshimasa Hayashi this month, as he announced a proposal to hunt fin whales, the second-largest species of whales after blue whales. The World Cetacean Alliance (WCA) marine conservation group said that whale watching in Japan was \u201ca far more successful industry\u201d than harvesting whale meat. \u201cCommercial whaling in the 21st century is unjustifiable,\u201d it said. \u00a0\u201cThe whaling industry in Japan recognizes that it is a challenge to increase whale meat consumption and there is currently no market,\u201d WCA said. \u201cSo why keep slaughtering these wonderful and intelligent animals?\u201d Tokoro ruled out whale watching. \u201cWe will not switch to whale watching but eating whale meat while watching whales might be quite a nice touch,\u201d he told CNN. Demand for whale meat in Japan Over the years, Kyodo Senpaku has launched aggressive public relation campaigns to promote whale meat and win over new generations of young diners. Tokoro says he eats whale meat every day. \u201cWhale meat is not only delicious, it\u2019s good for you,\u201d Tokoro told reporters during the tour of his ship, as he talked\u00a0up the purported \u201chealth benefits\u201d of eating whale, claiming that the meat could cure hair loss and cancer. \u201cI can definitely say whale meat and rice is a really good (combination) for Japanese people. There is no doubt about that, much better than beef and bun.\u201d Last year Tokoro, again wearing his whale hat, launched controversial whale meat vending machines, offering whale sashimi, whale steak and whale bacon. The company has also sponsored influencers from countries such as Russia, Thailand and South Korea \u2013 hosting them at a local izakaya in Osaka, where they sampled dishes like whale sashimi and skewers and encouraging them to take the message back to their followers that whale meat was delicious and acceptable. Japan may have a long and storied history of whaling dating back to the Edo period in the 1600s, but experts say whale meat consumption only really peaked after World War II \u2013 when food sources, especially protein, were scarce. Today, whale meat is now\u00a0considered more of a \u201cluxury\u201d dish, said Nobuhiro Kishigami, a professor at the National Museum of Ethnology, one of the country\u2019s largest research institutes. \u201cThe fact is that there is little interest in whaling and whale meat among Japanese people as a whole,\u201d Kishigami told CNN. \u201cMost young people, especially the majority that live in cities, do not know or care much about whaling and its history and remain indifferent.\u201d The same goes for dolphin meat, he added. \u201cIt\u2019s just a sign of the times. But if we were asked to stop eating blue fin tuna, there would be a huge uproar. We would react very badly to that.\u201d Japan\u2019s fisheries ministry estimates that between 1,000 and 2,000 tons of whale meat are consumed annually in the country, compared to average annual totals of more than 230,000 tons during the 1960s. \u201cThere is still certainly a market (for whale meat in Japan) but market size and production volume have shrunk dramatically,\u201d economics professor Mitsuhiro Kishimoto from the Shimonoseki City University told CNN, noting that several major whaling companies had since withdrawn from the trade. \u201cThe demand for whale blubber disappeared after the discovery of oil and petroleum products, so many countries stopped whaling and with international regulations, the number of caught whales decreased and as a result, whale meat production decreased while beef, pork and chicken became more popular,\u201d he said. Scientists have also expressed\u00a0concern about the risks of consuming whale meat, with studies pointing to high levels of mercury found in whale and dolphin meat, which could prove dangerous to consumers \u2013 especially pregnant women and young children. Could Japanese whalers return to the Southern Ocean? Located in deep waters surrounding the entire continent of Antarctica, the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary hosts dozens of whale species including humpbacks, blue whales and fin whales. It was established by the IWC in 1994 to protect whale species after centuries of hunting, but until 2019 Japan took regular trips to the region to hunt for self-stated \u201cscientific research\u201d purposes. Japanese whalers killed 333 minke whales in the Southern Ocean in 2018/2019, according to the IWC, before abandoning the region after it left the international body. Takaaki Sakamoto, director of the Whaling Affairs Office in Japan\u2019s Fisheries Agency, told CNN that Japan sent ships to the Antarctic last year to collect numbers and skin surface samples, but those expeditions did not involve killing whales. He said they planned to return this year to do the same. Tokoro told CNN that the Kangei Maru is not planning on killing whales beyond Japanese waters because it doesn\u2019t make economic sense. \u201cCommercial whaling is not profitable,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will take 50 days to get to the Antarctic and back and we are not confident we can make a profit by paying the wages of employees and fuel for 50 days. However, I will go only when the government orders me to go \u2026 Until then, I will not go commercial whaling at all.\u201d Sea Shepherd, an international marine conservation activist group which spent years confronting Japanese whaling ships in the past, told CNN that it believes Japan is unlikely to return to the Southern Ocean because that would require it to rejoin the IWC \u2014 whose members are fiercely opposed to commercial whaling. But\u00a0other activists aren\u2019t so confident. \u201cGiven the ship\u2019s long-range capabilities and drones, and recent announcements from Japan\u2019s fisheries ministry that it is keen to start hunting fin whales, we believe there is a high likelihood that Japanese whalers will return to the Southern Ocean,\u201d said James Anderson, activist and founder of the Whale Defense Agency (WDA). \u201cThe Southern Ocean is a critical habitat for many whale species that provides a safe haven for breeding and feeding \u2026 protecting it is more important than ever due to the increasing threats posed by climate change and illegal whaling.\u201d Rothwell, from ANU, said that if Japan looks to kill whales beyond its territorial waters, it can expect an international response. \u201cIt would immediately trigger global interest and action about the conservation and protection of whales, especially in waters sanctioned by the IWC as a whale sanctuary,\u201d Rothwell said. Watson, the veteran anti-whaling activist who founded Sea Shepherd but has since left, told CNN he\u2019s prepared to mount a physical response \u2013 with a former Japanese fisheries patrol vessel he\u2019s acquired in anticipation of Japanese whalers returning to the Antarctic by the end of the year. \u201cIt\u2019s called the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary for a reason \u2013 you don\u2019t kill whales there,\u201d Watson said. \u201cWe want to be able to track them down and intercept them like we\u2019ve done before \u2013 and we are more than prepared to do it again.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/asia/japan-whaling-mothership-kangei-maru-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_03_americas_mexico-claudia-sheinbaum-challenges-intl-latam", "text": "Claudia Sheinbaum won a landslide victory to become the first female president of Mexico and first Jewish person in the role, adding to the growing list of accolades to the climate scientist and former mayor of Mexico City. But\u00a0when\u00a0she formally takes office in October,\u00a0how\u00a0will\u00a0she\u00a0tackle the biggest challenges facing the country as concerns about its security and the future of its democracy loom large? Complicating her administration\u2019s debut,\u00a0Sheinbaum will also have to contend with the shadow of her polarizing mentor, the outgoing President Andres Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, from the same Morena party. Sunday\u2019s vote was widely seen as a referendum on L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s term. And while his popular social welfare policies have helped push many Mexicans above the poverty line, experts say his security measures have done little to address the expanding reach of organized crime in the country. In a speech following the election, Sheinbaum promised to govern for all and to be an investor-friendly president. \u201cWe know that dissent is part of democracy. And although the majority of the people support our project, our duty is and will always be to look after each and every one of the Mexicans without distinction,\u201d she said as she struck a conciliatory tone at the end of the highly partisan race. \u201cSo, although many Mexicans do not fully agree with our project, we will have to walk in peace and harmony to continue building a fair and more prosperous Mexico.\u201d She promised a government \u201cwithout corruption or impunity\u201d and guided by \u201crepublican austerity, financial and fiscal discipline and autonomy of the Bank of Mexico.\u201d A victory for the Morena party While Sheinbaum\u2019s victory was widely expected this weekend, the \u201cbiggest story of last night\u201d was that the Morena party looked set to gain supermajorities in both houses of Congress,\u00a0said\u00a0Carin Zissis, a Mexico expert, and editor-in-chief of the Americas Society/Council\u2019s website. On Monday morning, the Mexican peso slipped roughly 3% against the US dollar amid rising concern that the ruling party will have a clear path to pass controversial constitutional reforms sought by L\u00f3pez Obrador. The reforms include a range of issues in areas like pensions and the energy sector, but they also include controversial judicial and institutional reforms,\u00a0which critics say\u00a0would weaken the separation of powers and see the disappearance of some independent regulatory agencies. \u201cWe have to see what happens when she comes into office: There has been a history of Mexican presidents breaking the path of their predecessors, even when their predecessors more or less selected them,\u201d Zissis said, adding: \u201cThough, [Sheinbaum] has pledged throughout her campaign to continue his legacy.\u201d L\u00f3pez Obrador has pushed back on suggestions that he would be giving Sheinbaum cues, saying on Monday that he would not \u201cinfluence\u201d his prot\u00e9g\u00e9.\u00a0Sheinbaum is now \u201cthe one empowered to make all the decisions,\u201d he said. One of Sheinbaum\u2019s biographers, journalist Jorge Zepeda, has\u00a0speculated\u00a0that, once in office, Sheinbaum will unfurl her own platform gradually: she will first act as \u201cthe faithful disciple of the leader,\u201d before offering \u201cglimpses\u201d of her own program, taking care not to stoke instability in the movement\u2019s base. Gang violence and security Violence has dominated this year\u2019s election, with dozens of candidates murdered in the run-up to the vote and gangs trying to influence who was coming to power. Sheinbaum inherits a tragic epidemic of unsolved disappearances in the country:\u00a0More than 100,000 Mexicans and migrants have disappeared, with no explanation of their fate for families.\u00a0According to the think tank\u00a0Mexico Evalua,\u00a0around 95%\u00a0of all crimes nationwide\u00a0went unsolved\u00a0in the country in\u00a02022. Mexico also remains a dangerous place to be a woman and is \u201csadly, known for high levels of femicide gender-based violence where the number of disappeared women has gone up and up year to year,\u201d Stephanie Brewer, Mexico Director at the Washington Office for Latin America (WOLA), told CNN. With security at the top of voters\u2019 concerns, Sheinbaum\u00a0has pointed to her record as Mexico City mayor, with her team crediting her for improvements to the police\u2019s pay, working conditions and intelligence-gathering capabilities \u2013 although there is some debate as to how much impact these measures had on bringing down the crime rate, experts said. But will\u00a0Sheinbaum\u2019s tactics as mayor of\u00a0Mexico City\u00a0be replicable\u00a0at the federal level and in Mexico\u2019s 31 states, home to more than 126 million people?\u00a0She will have to tackle a landscape\u00a0where criminal groups have expanded their reach. An hour away from Mexico City, in the state of Morelos, Will Freeman, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said he was told that organized criminal groups had \u201ctheir own political candidates\u201d in the town of Cuautla who could rely on armed wings to intimidate other people. Gangs in the country have also diversified to sectors beyond the illicit manufacture of drugs.\u00a0\u201cThey\u2019re doing illegal logging, illegal mining. They\u2019re taking control of the water supply, which is increasingly scarce,\u201d Freeman said. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s\u00a0term saw the expansion of the militarization of public security to tackle crime, a two-decades-long approach that\u00a0has coincided with historically high levels of homicides. A\u00a0May\u00a0report by the Crisis Group\u00a0found official corruption and collusion was hampering effective law enforcement. (CNN has yet to receive comment from Mexican Secretary of Defense and the president\u2019s office over the findings.) Sheinbaum has largely remained coy about her security programs, but has said \u201cthat at the national level we can advance even more in terms of security,\u201d she said in a\u00a0tweet on X, which listed out her security strategy that included the consolidation of the National Guard, strengthened intelligence and research, and better\u00a0coordination between the police, state prosecutors\u2019 offices and the attorney general\u2019s office. Where Washington and Mexico City meet Sheinbaum has\u00a0previously signaled\u00a0the importance of the US-Mexico relationship, especially around trade. \u201cWith the United States there will be a relationship of friendship, respect, mutual respect and equality as it has been until now, and we will always defend the Mexicans who are on the other side of the border,\u201d she said late on Sunday, local time. But analysts note there will probably be differences between US and Mexico when it comes to foreign policy.\u00a0Sheinbaum is from the ideological and political left, and \u201cI think she will be as friendly as L\u00f3pez Obrador towards Cuba, Venezuela, Nicaragua [and] will not probably take the geopolitical positions the US would hope for\u201d over Gaza and Ukraine, Freeman said. L\u00f3pez Obrador has angered advocates\u00a0on both sides\u00a0of the Israel and Gaza conflict.\u00a0Mexico has ruled out breaking diplomatic relations with Israel, in contrast to some of its Latin American counterparts, but it has also sought to join South Africa\u2019s genocide case against Israel. Sheinbaum\u00a0condemned\u00a0the violence following Hamas\u2019 October 7 attack on Israel and has\u00a0previously\u00a0called for a Palestinian state. In a 2009 letter to the editor of a Mexican newspaper, Sheinbaum wrote that many of her relatives from her grandparent\u2019s generation \u201cwere exterminated in the concentration camps.\u201d She added that \u201cbecause of my Jewish origin, because of my love for Mexico and because I feel like a citizen of the world, I share with millions the desire for justice, equality, fraternity and peace, and therefore, I can only see with horror the images of the state bombings,\u201d referring to an Israeli bombing campaign of Gaza that year. \u201cNo reason justifies the murder of Palestinian civilians,\u201d she wrote in\u00a0La Jornada. A partner to the US on migration? Sheinbaum will assume office just a month before Americans head to the polls in November, where immigration is a top issue on the ballot for candidates President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump \u2013\u00a0both of whom have\u00a0relied heavily on Mexico to step up immigration enforcement and help stem the flow of migration to the US southern border. While migration across the countries\u2019 1,933 miles long border is a shared concern,\u00a0migration is not a major issue among Mexican voters, Zissis said. Still, under L\u00f3pez Obrador, the Mexican government has accepted US deportations of tens of thousands of non-Mexican citizens under a 2023 Biden administration rule. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s administration\u00a0also stepped up efforts to block the path of migrants heading to the US by transporting large numbers of people from the north of Mexico to the south. But while Mexico\u2019s policies may have become a \u201cmajor factor\u201d\u00a0in reducing\u00a0some\u00a0migrant crossing\u00a0at\u00a0the United States\u2019 southern border, Brewer said it is \u201cnot a sustainable model for anyone\u201d \u2013 especially\u00a0not for\u00a0migrants who\u00a0are often targeted for\u00a0violence in Mexico. Will Sheinbaum keep up Mexico\u2019s assistance to US immigration policy?\u00a0The transition of power\u00a0is likely now\u00a0raising\u00a0uncertainty in the minds of some Biden officials about what\u00a0could\u00a0change\u00a0with its key partner\u00a0at the border.

Both S\u00e1nchez Figueroa and her bodyguard later died in hospital, it said, adding that an investigation has been launched. Confirmation of S\u00e1nchez Figueroa\u2019s death came hours after Claudia Sheinbaum\u00a0won a landslide victory to become the first female president of Mexico, marking an achievement in a country known for its patriarchal culture and widespread femicide. Widespread violence against politicians loomed large in the election, the bloodiest in Mexico\u2019s history. Dozens of political candidates and applicants were killed by criminal organizations during the campaign season in attempts to influence the vote. Sheinbaum will begin her presidency on October 1, replacing the outgoing President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, her longtime ally whose social welfare programs lifted many Mexicans out of poverty, making their leftist Morena party favorite in the polls.

{"id": "2024_06_06_europe_european-parliament-elections-2024-explained-intl", "text": "One of the world\u2019s largest democratic exercises is underway, with some 373 million people across the European Union eligible to vote in elections for the next European Parliament. Voters in the 27 nations of the EU head to the polls from Thursday to Sunday to elect 720 members of the parliament, which will play a crucial role in shaping the priorities and political direction of the bloc for the next five years. The vote comes at a pivotal moment for the EU, which is grappling with issues ranging from the wars in Ukraine and Gaza to immigration and climate change. Polls have predicted big gains for hard-right parties in a number of countries, which could have long-term implications for the continent. Here\u2019s what you need to know about the world\u2019s biggest multi-country election. How do the elections work? The elections are held over four days every five years in June. This year, they are taking place between\u00a0June\u00a06\u00a0and\u00a09. They are held over multiple days because, despite being elections to an EU institution, they are still arranged and managed as national\u00a0ballots\u00a0by each of the EU\u2019s 27 member states.  In some countries, they may all be\u00a0held\u00a0on a single day, whereas others take place over several days. Because the elections are managed at a national level, they are not all carried out in the same exact way. However, they must all employ a proportional representation system\u00a0\u2013where the number of lawmakers\u00a0elected\u00a0to the parliament directly correlates to the percentage of people who voted for them. Once all the votes have been counted, each national political party will be assigned a number of\u00a0members of European Parliament (MEPs)\u00a0relative to their vote share. It is up to the member states to determine how this is assigned. Once they have been appointed to the parliament, MEPs can then join a European political party, which allows them to sit in a group in the parliament. These parties and groupings are multinational and based on a loose set of shared beliefs.\u00a0The bigger the grouping, the more influence it has in parliament. Results will start to come in late on Sunday, but full results will not be known until at least Monday. What\u2019s the point of the European Parliament and what do MEPs do? The European Parliament sits primarily in Brussels, Belgium, but moves roughly once a month to Strasbourg, France. It is the legislative branch of the EU and one of the bloc\u2019s three main institutions \u2013 along with the European Commission, which is the executive branch, and the European Council, which is made up of ministers from the governments of the 27 member states. It is the only EU institution where\u00a0representatives\u00a0are directly elected,\u00a0and MEPs pass laws which are applied all over the bloc. In order for any legislation to be implemented, both the council and parliament have to agree. One of the parliament\u2019s most crucial roles is approving the makeup of the commission, which is ultimately responsible for the political direction of the world\u2019s largest trading bloc, and it has the final say on who is appointed as president of the commission. Currently the top job is filled by Germany\u2019s Ursula von der Leyen, who is seeking a second term at the helm. The parliament also has\u00a0ultimate approval\u00a0over\u00a0the billions of euros allocated in the EU budget. It often has the final\u00a0word\u00a0on major policy issues\u00a0such as\u00a0the budget, trade\u00a0and\u00a0sanctions on foreign nationals. The parliament can also put major international objectives in the deep freeze. For example, A comprehensive mutual investment agreement between the EU and China is effectively on hold while some MEPs are under sanctions from China. The parliament as a whole has refused to advance the agreement until the sanctions are lifted. What are the biggest issues in this vote? Since this week\u2019s election is in effect 27 individual national elections, some\u00a0issues are in play in some countries but not in others. Broadly speaking, immigration, climate change, security and support for Ukraine are issues that matter across the bloc. While\u00a0irregular\u00a0migration figures are lower than they were\u00a0during\u00a0the 2015-2016\u00a0refugee\u00a0crisis, it is still a sensitive issue across the EU, as some countries\u00a0bear a disproportionate share of\u00a0the burden\u00a0while\u00a0others are loathe to\u00a0do their part. Slowing the effects of climate change and making Europe greener has been a priority for a long time. However, some countries now balk at the cost of\u00a0cutting fossil fuel emissions. The EU is largely united on its support for Ukraine, but that too could be affected if populists like\u00a0France\u2019s Marine\u00a0Le Pen are elected\u00a0to lead national governments. What are the political groupings? If the\u00a0720 MEPs representing 27 countries and hundreds of different domestic political parties\u00a0were all left to their own devices, things would\u00a0get very complicated. To simplify the work of the parliament, leaders of national governments form alliances with each other based on their shared political beliefs \u2013 the European political parties. If\u00a0a politician is\u00a0a member of, for example, French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s Renaissance party in France,\u00a0he or she\u00a0will stand for that party as an MEP at a national level. If\u00a0they\u00a0are then elected to the European Parliament,\u00a0they\u00a0will join the centrist, liberal European party, Renew Europe \u2013\u00a0which currently has members from 24 of the 27 EU members. Once\u00a0seated\u00a0in parliament,\u00a0they\u00a0will sit alongside the other MEPs from Renew parties in other countries as a political grouping. There are seven main groupings, ranging from the extremes of the far right to the far left. The two dominant groupings are the center-right conservative European People\u2019s Party (EPP) and the center-left\u00a0Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D). Due to proportional representation, no single group has anything resembling a majority and therefore\u00a0they\u00a0must form broad coalitions\u00a0to get anything done in parliament. The EPP and S&D (or their previous incarnations) have dominated this coalition\u00a0for decades. While these two parties are still expected to be the largest after the elections, all eyes are on the other main right-wing groups,\u00a0the\u00a0European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) and the hard-right, populist Identity and Democracy (ID). What\u2019s likely to happen in the election? It is expected that the EPP and S&D centrist coalition will largely hold. However, it is also expected that ECR and ID will make significant gains that result\u00a0in more power in the next parliament. The two hard-right parties have not said they will work together and the leaderships of the two groups are known to dislike each other. Giorgia Meloni, the Italian prime minister and president of the ECR\u00a0bloc, has an eye on working with the mainstream right at an EU level, for instance. During\u00a0the\u00a02022 Italian\u00a0general\u00a0election, much was made of Meloni\u2019s right-wing rhetoric. She was a hardliner on immigration,\u00a0and\u00a0had\u00a0questioned LGBTQ+ rights, among other things. However, since winning she has been pragmatic in working with\u00a0those in power\u00a0at a European level \u2013 most notably\u00a0von der Leyen, the commission\u2019s president, who is herself a member of the more mainstream EPP. Von der Leyen even went so far as\u00a0to visit\u00a0the Italian island of Lampedusa, which has\u00a0been\u00a0an arrival point for\u00a0large numbers of irregular\u00a0migrants, to set out a\u00a010-point EU plan\u00a0to support Italy with the influx. Critics say that\u00a0Meloni\u00a0has sold out; supporters say that she has played her cards perfectly and managed to pull the EU\u2019s center in her direction.\u00a0Evidence of this might be the EU\u00a0having\u00a0finally\u00a0agreed a deal\u00a0earlier\u00a0this year\u00a0on how it would share the\u00a0weight\u00a0of irregular migration, after years of deadlock and negotiation. How could the election affect European politics? The\u00a0possibility\u00a0that the EU\u2019s political center might be up for grabs\u00a0is the most important context of these elections. The opaque and fluid nature of politics at a European level means that a lot can change over the course of a five-year period. Between the EPP and S&D, there might be a centrist coalition on day one of this\u00a0new\u00a0parliament. But these are not formal coalitions, rather loose alliances that vote together, issue by issue. This is where the idea of a\u00a0right-wing\u00a0ECR and ID axis becomes significant. The rise of the far-right\u2019s influence in European Parliament follows a similar trend at the national level in a number of major EU member states. National\u00a0elections\u00a0are\u00a0set to take place in France in 2027,\u00a0in which\u00a0right-wing populist\u00a0Le Pen could emerge victorious. She is the chair of ID and has recently made obvious efforts to detoxify the\u00a0bloc\u00a0by expelling\u00a0lawmakers from\u00a0the far-right Alternative for Germany\u00a0(AfD)\u00a0from\u00a0its ranks\u00a0following accusations of antisemitism.\u00a0 A\u00a0victory in the French presidential election would\u00a0of course\u00a0make Le Pen a much bigger major player in European politics. That might not mean any formal coalition between the center-right EPP and ID, but the politics of the European Parliament is a sliding scale of sorts and, if France shifts right, it\u2019s fair to say the center-right will take note. There are EPP members (and certainly ECR members) who will agree with ID members on\u00a0matters\u00a0such as\u00a0immigration and climate change. When those issues come up and the parliament has a role to play, it\u2019s not implausible that\u00a0the\u00a0ECR and ID could\u00a0then put\u00a0huge pressure on EPP lawmakers to vote the same way. It is, after all, always worth remembering that these people must still answer to their domestic voters, who can sack them at the next election.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/europe/european-parliament-elections-2024-explained-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "world"}}

Now we are very vigilant, he will receive all the consular protections that apply in such a case. I want to say the truth in the face of the brainwashing that we hear,\u201d Macron said. Russia\u2019s Investigative Committee said earlier on Thursday that a French citizen, employed by the non-profit Swiss Center for Humanitarian Dialogue, was detained on suspicion of \u201ccollecting information in the field of military activities of the Russian Federation.\u201d Video released by the Investigative Committee showed the man being arrested by security personnel\u00a0at\u00a0a cafe in Moscow and escorted\u00a0into a military van. The Investigative Committee alleges the French national had\u00a0been gathering information on Russia\u2019s \u201cmilitary and military-technical activities\u201d for several years and didn\u2019t register as a foreign agent. \u201cFor these purposes, he repeatedly visited the territory of Russia, including the city of Moscow, where he held meetings with citizens of the Russian Federation,\u201d the Investigative Committee said. An Investigative Committee official told Russian state news agency TASS that the man worked as a consultant at the non-profit handling Eurasian issues after the February 2014 events in Ukraine, including the mass pro-democracy protests that swept Kyiv and the exit of the pro-Russian, former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich. CNN has reached out to the French Foreign Ministry and the Swiss Center for Humanitarian Dialogue for comment. Relations between both countries became strained when Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine more than two years ago. Several Westerners have found themselves detained in the country amid the rising tensions. US-Russian journalist Alsu\u00a0Kurmasheva was detained last year in the Russian city of Kazan while waiting for a return flight to the Czech Republic, where she was based. She had arrived in Russia in May due to an urgent family matter, according to her employer the US-funded Radio Free Europe/ Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), and was accused of refusing to register as a foreign agent. Russia expanded its law on \u201cforeign agents\u201d in 2022, signaling an intensifying crackdown on free speech and opposition under Putin.

{"id": "2024_06_06_india_india-opposition-rahul-gandhi-election-analysis-intl-hnk", "text": "At the start of the year, Narendra Modi launched his unofficial election campaign from the steps of a grand Hindu temple. India was about to enter a \u201cdivine\u201d era, he said, declaring the beginning of a \u201cnew time cycle.\u201d January\u2019s inauguration of the Ram Mandir, on the site of a destroyed mosque, analysts said, was the latest and most significant step in a years-long project, moving India away from its secular, pluralist founding principles and toward a new future as a Hindu nation. On Tuesday night, Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lost its seat in the town where the temple stands. The loss sent shock waves through a country where a firebrand ideology of Hindu nationalism has \u2013 over the last decade of Modi\u2019s leadership \u2013 been thrust into to the center of daily life. But as the election results showed, for many voters, his BJP\u2019s strident ideology could not compensate for far more pressing local issues, including soaring unemployment and rising inflation. The opposition \u2013 which had been all but written off by many pundits and polls \u2013 put on a far stronger showing than expected, winning seats in BJP strongholds while denting Modi\u2019s aura of invincibility. The INDIA alliance, a grouping of dozens of political parties with a breadth of political positions, won 235 out of 543 seats in the lower house of Parliament, denying the BJP its dream of forming a supermajority \u2013 and with it a mandate to enact radical change. The star face of that alliance, Indian National Congress lawmaker Rahul Gandhi, had long been ridiculed by Modi, disregarded by many analysts as an ineffective and weak leader. Not so anymore. Voters have sent a \u201cclear message\u201d to Modi, Gandhi said Tuesday night. \u201cWe do not want you.\u201d Though the opposition lost, for many it felt like a win. Modi will enter a third consecutive term as India\u2019s prime minister \u2013 becoming only the second person to do so - but must rely on his coalition allies in a way he has never done before. \u201cThe people\u2019s mandate has given befitting reply to the BJP and their politics of hate, corruption,\u201d Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge told reporters Wednesday. \u201cThis is a mandate in defense of the Constitution of India\u2026 and (a mandate) to save democracy.\u201d \u2018Not a normal contest\u2019 While the BJP alone still won more seats than the INDIA alliance combined, by many critics\u2019 accounts, there wasn\u2019t a level playing field. \u201cThis was not a normal contest,\u201d Indian activist Yogendra Yadav, told local news channel India Today. Gandhi, the scion of a political dynasty that has produced three prime ministers, was last year disqualified as a lawmaker, and handed a two-year jail sentence for defamation, in a ruling his supporters say was politically motivated. Gandhi was later reinstated as a lawmaker following an intervention from India\u2019s Supreme Court \u2013 and didn\u2019t serve prison time. Weeks before the election began, the Congress accused the BJP of crippling its ability to campaign after its accounts were frozen by the tax department, leaving it unable to use some $20 million in funds. Then came the arrest of Arvind Kejriwal, Delhi chief minister and head of the popular Aam Aadmi Party, who was taken into custody for alleged corruption, and is now back in jail after being released toward the end of the campaign. The BJP has repeatedly denied accusations of political motivation. \u201cHere is a contest where there is a stranglehold on power. The BJP had more money than\u2026 anyone else. They had the entire media of this country lined up as their spokesperson,\u201d Yadav said. \u201cIn this context, getting (235 seats) is defeat. There is no other word for it.\u201d A shift in trends No other place exemplifies the BJP\u2019s disappointment like the state of Uttar Pradesh in India\u2019s north. Home to more than 200 million people, the nation\u2019s most populous state lies in the heart of the \u201cHindi belt\u201d \u2014 the predominantly Hindi-speaking states where support for Modi is especially strong. It is governed by a firebrand monk turned BJP politician, Yogi Adityanath, whose Hindu-first policies have polarized people along religious lines. And on Tuesday, voters there appeared to put their faith in the hands of the INDIA alliance, electing their candidates to 43 out of 80 seats \u2013 seemingly rejecting this populist vision for a Hindu-first nation. The BJP won 33, down from 62 at the previous election. In Banswara, in the western state of Rajasthan, where Modi\u2019s election campaign took its most divisive turn, voters were also turned off. It was there that the Indian leader sparked a row over hate speech when he accused the Congress of wanting to distribute the country\u2019s wealth among Muslims, referring to them as \u201cinfiltrators.\u201d The BJP candidate there, a two-time incumbent lawmaker, lost his seat to a rival from a much smaller, regional party. \u201cThe BJP did not sell its Hindu agenda as much as it thought. Other countervailing factors have impacted the electorate,\u201d said T.V. Paul, a professor from McGill University. Modi did not define a single overarching issue or narrative for the election, so voters focused more on local matters, according to Milan Vaishnav from the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, \u201cIn the absence of that, what we\u2019ve got in a federal country like India is a series of state-by-state, local contests in which more mundane, parochial issues really matter,\u201d he said. \u201cJobs, inflation, local leaders, incumbency, caste, ethnicity, religion and those seem to have worked against the prime minister and his party.\u201d As results began to trickle in Tuesday night, and the Congress learned of its gains across the country, there were scenes of jubilation at its headquarters in the capital New Delhi. \u201cRahul Gandhi is the only hope our country has,\u201d said Lakshman Valhekar, who traveled more than 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) from his home state in Maharashtra for the result. \u201cI believe in them completely. BJP is done. BJP is out.\u201d The electorate has, said Paul from McGill University, \u201coccasionally shown their capacity to make large-scale challenge to any kind of authoritarian order that is being imposed on them.\u201d Sitting in front of a large crowd in New Delhi Tuesday, Gandhi pulled out a small, pocket-sized version of India\u2019s constitution. Holding the red and black book, the leader began to speak. \u201cTo save this,\u201d he said, \u201cwe have taken the first and biggest step.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/india/india-opposition-rahul-gandhi-election-analysis-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "world"}}

The killing occurred in Bogot\u00e1 in January 2023, and has since captured public attention in Colombia. Before her death, Trespalacios was beginning to gain success at music festivals and had been in a romantic relationship with Poulos since 2021, according to accounts from her family and lawyers who took her case. The Office of the Attorney General of Colombia said in a statement after the ruling that its prosecutors had proven that Poulos struck and suffocated his partner and tried to hide the body. \u201cThe security camera records show that the aggressor wrapped the victim\u2019s body, hid it in a suitcase and abandoned it in a garbage container in the town of Fontib\u00f3n, in the west of Bogot\u00e1. It was found there hours later by the authorities,\u201d the AG office said. During Tuesday\u2019s court proceedings, the judge considered that the evidence presented by the prosecutors was sufficient to determine Poulos\u2019 guilt, imposing a prison sentence of 42 years and eight months \u2013 about five years less than what prosecutors had requested. Additionally, the judge prohibited Poulos from approaching or attempting to communicate with Trespalacios\u2019 family for 20 years, and ordered that he be expelled from Colombia once he completes his sentence. Poulos\u2019 defense team has said it will appeal the judgement. It had argued that Poulos was innocent of femicide and that he should instead be tried for homicide, which would carry a lesser sentence. In Colombia, femicide \u2014 the killing of a woman because of her gender \u2014 is considered a more serious crime than homicide. Under Colombian law, femicide is often punished with a higher penalty. Defense lawyer Fredy Sp\u00edndola told the Focus Noticias channel that he and his client believe the witnesses \u201cwere all in cahoots, that they all said the same thing.\u201d The victim\u2019s legal team, meanwhile, celebrated the sentence, saying it recognizes that Trespalacios was a victim of various types of violence. \u201cIt is a fair decision for us, which is also consistent with the material evidentiary elements, with the theory of the case that we had from the beginning. From the beginning, we established that we were facing objectification, an instrumentalization of a woman through various factors, psychological violence, violence of various types, including physical violence,\u201d lawyer Miguel \u00c1ngel del R\u00edo told Focus Noticias. Poulos was detained in Panama in January 2023, when he was trying to fly to Turkey. He was then deported to Colombia, where he denied the charges against him. He was sentenced almost a year and a half after Trespalacios\u2019 death.

The new themed land, called Fantasy Springs, combines the worlds of three popular Disney movie franchises \u2013 \u201cPeter Pan,\u201d \u201cFrozen\u201d and \u201cTangled.\u201d Spanning 140,000 square meters and built at a cost of $2 billion (or 310 billion yen), it\u2019s the eighth \u201cport\u201d in DisneySea and is the park\u2019s largest expansion since opening in 2001. (The resort\u2019s original Tokyo Disneyland park \u2013 owned by Oriental Land Co. Ltd. \u2013 opened its doors in 1983 and was the first Disney park to be built outside of the United States.) A few Disney firsts Visitors to the new port first head through a tunnel passage made of rocks shaped like Disney characters from the three film franchises that inspired Fantasy Springs. Behind the waterfall at the entrance, called Magic Fountain, sits four new rides, a new hotel and eight new dining outlets (including three inside the hotel). One of the most anticipated additions inside Fantasy Springs is undoubtedly Rapunzel\u2019s Forest, Disney\u2019s first Tangled-inspired themed area. Visitors can tour the kingdom of Corona, visit the tower where Rapunzel lives and relive the love story between Rapunzel and thief Flynn Rider on a five-minute gondola ride called Rapunzel\u2019s Lantern Festival. The Snuggly Duckling, a tavern named for and designed like the speakeasy featured in the movie, serves the likes of cheeseburgers and German-style pancake desserts. Peter Pan\u2019s Never Land Adventure Elsewhere in Fantasy Springs, Peter Pan\u2019s Never Land Adventure is a new ride that allows visitors to join \u201cboy who never grows up\u201d alongside Tinker Bell and the Lost Kids on a quest to save John Darling \u2013 a main character in the 1953 movie  \u2013 from Captain Hook and his pirates. It isn\u2019t the first Peter Pan ride to appear in the Tokyo Disney Resort \u2013 Peter Pan\u2019s Flight can be found nearby at Tokyo Disneyland. But Disney promises guests won\u2019t suffer from deja vu; the new six-minute attraction \u201cseamlessly blends ride vehicle motion with show elements and all-new animation, including a groundbreaking projection system.\u201d The Peter Pan-themed area inside Fantasy Springs also offers a family-friendly buggy ride through Pixie Hollow, the fairy valley where Tinker Bell and her pals live.

{"id": "2024_05_02_style_aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl", "text": "Miami has a new addition to its skyline \u2013 a 66-story residential tower built by Aston Martin, marking the British luxury sports carmaker\u2019s first foray into the residential real estate market. Comprising of 391 units, Aston Martin Residences Miami sits at the mouth of the Miami River on Biscayne Bay, the firm said in a statement Tuesday. Designed in partnership with architect Rodolfo Miani of Bodas Mian Anger and built by G&G Business Developments, the 249-meter- (818-foot-) tall building houses seven penthouses, each with private pools and terraces, as well as apartments ranging in size from one to five bedrooms. The largest unit is the \u201cUnique Triplex Penthouse,\u201d arranged over three floors at the top of the building, which remains on the market for $59 million. The property was officially opened on Tuesday. Timed to coincide with the Formula One Miami Grand Prix, the company said in a statement that it marks \u201cthe latest distinct expression of Aston Martin\u2019s ultra-luxury high performance brand.\u201d Featuring an infinity pool with a pool deck, jacuzzis and cabanas on the 55th floor, the sail-shaped complex has a two-floor fitness center, two movie theaters and a virtual golf simulator. The building has a sky bar and lounge, chef\u2019s kitchen, ballroom and private dining areas, as well as a spa, beauty salon and barber shop. Direct access to the sea via a superyacht marina is also available, plus a private butler service. Germ\u00e1n Coto, chief executive officer of G&G Business Developments, told CNN Tuesday that the firm wanted to work on a project in the \u201ccosmopolitan city\u201d of Miami, and that this piece of land was the perfect choice. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing plot with an excellent view of the river,\u201d said Coto. The structure\u2019s aerodynamic shape helps the building deal with the technical challenges presented by high winds in the area, as well as evoking the sleek shape of an Aston Martin, according to Marek Reichman, executive vice president and chief creative officer of Aston Martin. It also becomes wider from the base to the mid-section before tightening once more towards the top, making it appear to bow out over people on street level, Reichman told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the drama,\u201d he added. Challenges However, the process wasn\u2019t all plain sailing. \u201cIt was difficult to achieve what we wanted because the space and the plot is kind of small,\u201d said Coto, with the building fitting into a 1.25-acre plot of land. Meanwhile, local building regulations imposed strict standards, explained Reichman, taking into account the low-lying land and propensity for flooding. \u201cThey were some of the most amazing challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to withstand the flooding with the windows that are on street level.\u201d There were further obstacles due to the curved shape of the building, which means that units on the east side have an individual architectural structural component. Aston Martin touches Homeowners are able to customize their interior space with the help of the Aston Martin design team, with three style packages \u2013 Timeless, Covert and Indulgent \u2013 drawing on the company\u2019s British heritage, as well as the building\u2019s context. \u201cIt needs to have part of the DNA of an Aston Martin,\u201d Reichman said. \u201cBut we are in Miami, you don\u2019t have a cold November evening where you need to put the log fire on, so you\u2019ve got to be considerate of the environment that you\u2019re in.\u201d Design elements running through the building include doors with bespoke Aston Martin handles, number plinths and kestrel tan leather door tabs. Aston Martin said that 99% of the properties sold before the building was completed. Residences were sold for $1.5 million to $8.5 million, while penthouses ranged from $16 million to $59 million. The Unique Triplex Penthouse, on the market for $59 million, comes with the last remaining Aston Martin Vulcan, an 820 brake horsepower all-carbon fiber supercar, of which only 24 exist, a spokesman for the company said. Meanwhile, buyers of the 47 Signature and Penthouse units were also able to choose between an Aston Martin DBX sports SUV or the company\u2019s DB11 sportscar. Aston Martin isn\u2019t the first luxury carmaker to enter the residential property market. A 63-story building from Bentley will open in 2026 along the coastline of Sunny Isles Beach, Florida. Featuring 216 units, the property will have an elevator designed to take residents up to their doorstep while seated inside their cars.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/02/style/aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "travel_sambuca-sicily-cheap-homes-three-euros", "text": "Dwindling Italian towns have been pulling out all the stops to lure new residents in recent years, with several one-euro home schemes launching across the country. But while some towns have struggled to find buyers for their abandoned buildings, others have been basking in the glory of successful sales. After seeing huge demand for its previous home sell offs in 2019 and 2021, Sicily\u2019s Sambuca di Sicilia is preparing to put a third batch under the hammer, this time with starting prices of 3 euros, or just over $3. Previous success \u201cWe just want to make it clear that by numbering these batches, more sales will likely follow in coming years,\u201d newly elected mayor Giuseppe Cacioppo tells CNN. \u201cForeigners are flocking to buy our homes, it\u2019s been a hit so far.\u201d Cacioppo encourages potential buyers who are heading to the region to pay the town a visit and check out the 12 or so homes up for grabs this time. \u201cThe timing is perfect,\u201d he says. \u201cTourists and interested buyers currently traveling to Italy, and those planning a trip in spring and summer can come take a look.\u201d According to Cacioppo, the available homes, located in the old Saracen district, are as \u201cstructurally stable as those so far sold\u201d but in need of a restyle. Sambuca made global headlines back in 2019 when CNN announced that it was putting 16 dwellings up for sale for\u00a0one euro. Two years later, the town offered up a second batch of homes for two euros. The fire-sale, which lured international buyers as far as the Middle East, has helped to revamp the local economy with an influx of 20 million euros (around $21.8 million,) says Cacioppo. This includes turnover from new B&Bs, new shops that have opened in the town and contracts with builders, architects, surveyors, interior designers and notaries. \u201cThe two batches of houses, owned by the town hall, revitalized the private real estate sector. People rushing to grab one at auction but didn\u2019t make the final cut bought a cheap house instead. So far, 250 homes have been sold,\u201d says Cacioppo. Sambuca\u2019s triumphant efforts to sell off its empty homes are largely credited to the fact that the local authorities actually own the abandoned dwellings they hope to offload. Other depopulated Italian towns, such as medieval village Patrica, located south of Rome, have attempted to launch similar schemes, but struggled to track down the former owners to gain permission to sell their empty homes. Revival hopes Sambuca\u2019s authorities took possession of the town\u2019s abandoned houses after an earthquake struck the surrounding Belice Valley in 1969. The natural disaster sent locals fleeing, leaving behind empty homes. \u201cRome\u2019s government back then approved a specific law for Sambuca\u2019s revival that granted the town hall ownership of the abandoned homes, so we can dispose of these as we wish, and there are no middle agencies,\u201d says Cacioppo. This means that the sale process is much faster, as the local authorities don\u2019t need to liaise between owners and buyers. The homes on offer this time consist of single, two to three-bedroom 50 to 80 square-meter houses built with golden-brownish stones and spread over one or three floors. Many have iron-wrought balconies overlooking cobbled alleys and panoramic terraces, as well as original green-painted old wooden doors with decorated arches and windows. Those in the best condition feature tiny internal Moorish courtyards with lemon trees and old painted majolica tile floors. But most are badly in need of repair and filled with forgotten items and piles of broken, dusty furniture. Depending on the condition of the property, restyles usually start at \u20ac30,000 (around $32,500) for a simple makeover, but can rise to over \u20ac200,000 (roughly ($217,000) if buyers plan to turn the house into a luxury retreat. One American couple who purchased a bargain home in the town went on to add an internal elevator. Many of those buyers who won the previous bids eventually ended up buying more properties in town. These were often attached homes, which meant that they could be expanded into one big property. High demand Keen to cash-in on the high demand, locals have rushed to sell off garages or old abandoned attics. Most of the people who\u2019ve been lured to this remote spot in Sicily, situated far from the touristy crowds, are from the US. This has helped to create a \u201cLittle America,\u201d with most residents now speaking some English with a Sicilian accent, even the elders. Foreigners may have been a rare sight here before 2019, but they\u2019ve become part of the landscape now, jokes Cacioppo, with a significant expat community now calling Sambuca home. Last year, the town hall opened remote-working spaces to lure global digital workers, offering free stays and strengthening its Wi-Fi connection throughout the narrow alleys. \u201cOur town is now definitely on the map,\u201d says Cacioppo. The Sambuca homes going up for auction in this latest scheme will be sold to the highest bidder, with the winning bid placed in a sealed envelope and opened in front of a judge after the application deadline. Those taking part in the auction are required to pay a deposit guarantee of 5,000 euros (around $5,430). If they lose the bid, the sum will immediately be returned to them. But if they win, the 5,000 euros will automatically become their deposit guarantee. The rules of the scheme stipulate that buyers must have completed the renovation work on their homes within three years, or risk losing their deposit guarantee. However, the town hall has so far been flexible on deadlines due to the pandemic, allowing more time to complete the works during and after the Covid-19 pandemic. In the previous sales, houses were eventually sold at prices between 1 and 25,000 euros (roughly $27,133,) with most going for between 5,000 euros (around $5,426) to 10,000 euros. Interested applicants can find photos and descriptions of the available homes, along with   application forms, on the town hall\u2019s official website.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/sambuca-sicily-cheap-homes-three-euros/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_06_02_europe_russia-defense-ministry-shakeup-intl", "text": "Removing a long-time defense minister from his post is nothing out of the ordinary. Arresting five of his senior staff, however, is clearly more than just a search for fresh blood \u2014 especially in Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia. After the shock ouster, two weeks ago, of Sergei Shoigu as the minister for defense, a wave of arrests has gutted the defense ministry\u2019s top brass under the guise of an anti-corruption campaign. The timing is as intriguing as the arrests and reshuffle. After almost three years of failure on the battlefields in Ukraine, Russia has just gained the upper hand. It has, in recent weeks, launched a largely successful offensive in the north, toward Kharkiv, coupled with victories in the Donbas region in the east, too. Ukraine\u2019s crippling manpower shortage and dwindling ammunition supplies \u2014 exacerbated by months of stalling in the US Congress to approve a military support package \u2014 have also helped reverse Russia\u2019s fortunes. So the question then is, why shake up the ministry in charge of winning the war now? Analysts who spoke to CNN described the defense ministry as one of the most corrupt in the country. Russian state media has been disclosing military contracts worth eye-watering sums of money and publicly shaming the ministry\u2019s senior officials and their lavish lifestyles. But as one analyst told CNN, what we are witnessing is a \u201cvery complex polycentric game,\u201d one that is related to timing and Putin\u2019s existential search for victory against the West. Prigozhin message from the grave Hanging over this shake-up is the ghost of Yevgeny Prigozhin, boss of the Wagner mercenary group, who was also formerly known as \u201cPutin\u2019s Chef.\u201d Before his death, he had expressed hatred for Shoigu and Russia\u2019s top general, Valery Gerasimov, through profanity-laden tirades, accusing them and the ministry of corruption and incompetence. Prigozhin led a mutiny on Moscow that was supposed to end with the overthrow of Shoigu and Gerasimov. Instead, he put the president in an awkward position and challenged his authority. Putin responded by describing Prigozhin as a traitor and stripped him of his assets, all before he died in a suspicious plane crash, alongside his most senior advisers. Since then, Putin has kept the inefficiencies of the ministry\u2019s weapons procurement, as well as its bungled invasion of Ukraine and corruption allegations, out of the public eye, keen to show he would not make any knee-jerk reactions following the mutiny. Doing so might question his authority and strength to the Russian people. Putin was likely awaiting his reelection by the Russian people in March before making moving in on the defense ministry. The changes came shortly after Victory Day celebrations on May 9, which Putin and Shoigu attended, side by side, in a seemingly amicable appearance. Despite his removal as defense minister, Shoigu will remain in Putin\u2019s orbit after being moved sideways to a new role as secretary of the security council. Putin\u2019s interests: Ukraine Tatiyana Stanovaya, Senior Fellow at Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, told CNN that whether Prigozhin may have been right about the officials\u2019 corruption is not what\u2019s important. In Russia, she said, \u201cright and wrong doesn\u2019t exist in politics \u2014 only interests matter.\u201d Putin\u2019s interest is in keeping his house in order but, more pressingly, achieving victory in Ukraine. The defense ministry is central to how that war ends. With Putin installing a civilian economist, Andrey Belousov, as the new defense minister, he has signaled he wants the ministry, with its vast budget, to procure weapons more quickly and economically. Russia\u2019s 2024 budget shows it is seeking to spend 6% of GDP on defense, the highest in modern Russian history, and will outpace social spending \u2014 a sign of the country\u2019s transition to a wartime economy. The corruption in question \u2013 Shamarin and Ivanov Mikhail Komin, a Russian political scientist and Visiting Fellow at the European Council of Foreign Affairs based in Vienna, told CNN that \u201cShoigu\u2019s group, among the Russian elites, is one of the most rent-seeking. More, for example, than some of Putin\u2019s inner circle.\u201d Last Friday, Lieutenant General Vadim Shamarin, chief of the Main Communication Directorate of the Russian Armed Forces, was charged with \u201creceiving a bribe on an especially large scale,\u201d of 36 million rubles (around $393,000) from a factory that supplies the ministry with communications equipment. In exchange, he is alleged to have awarded the company lucrative government contracts. Shamarin has pleaded not guilty, according to Russian state media. Russian state media has also played a role in communicating the Kremlin\u2019s crackdown on the ministry. Following Shamarin\u2019s arrest in May, state-run Ria Novosti reported that his wife had purchased a Mercedez-Benz GLE in 2018 for 20 million rubles (about $218,000) at a time when his income was no higher than $34,000. A separate report found her income that year was 872,000 rubles ($9,740). The highest profile of the five officials arrested was Timur Ivanov, the deputy defense minister. He was put under house arrest in late April, also on suspicion of taking bribes. Ivanov had become a focus of the Anti-Corruption Foundation, founded by Alexey Navalny, who was killed in a Russian prison in February. He and his organization exposed the lavish lifestyle enjoyed by Ivanov\u2019s partner \u2014 visiting invite-only jewelers, wearing couture clothing and owning a chalet in the chic ski resort of Courchevel in France. They questioned how she afforded such a lifestyle when her husband\u2019s salary was officially $175,000 a year. Russian state media reported that Ivanov maintains his innocence, citing its own source. There can\u2019t be overlap, but corruption will still remain For Stanovaya, the reasons for replacing figures such as Ivanov and Shamarin are simple. \u201cPart of Putin\u2019s logic is that you can\u2019t field someone in this position (as defense minister) where there are significant interests of the previous.\u201d To help clean up the ministry, Putin has appointed Oleg Savelyev, a former auditor at the Russia Accounts Chamber, as the deputy minister of defense. He will be \u201caware of the corruption that already exists in the defense sector,\u201d Komin said. Prigozhin\u2019s final wish Given the sweeping changes made by the president, rumors have swirled about the position of the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces, Valery Gerasimov, the other target of Prigozhin\u2019s rants. Stanovaya said, \u201cThere are so many rumors now that he [Gerasimov] might be dismissed soon,\u201d but the fact he has so far been spared gives Gerasimov \u201ca window to start fighting for his own interests,\u201d she added. \u201cGerasimov is fighting against his enemies, trying to secure his future,\u201d Stanovaya said. Komin agreed that Gerasimov may keep his position for now, as Putin has said he does not intend to make any other changes. Crucially, Komin suggested that Gerasimov\u2019s luck may be that there lacks a position, similar to Shoigu\u2019s where he can publicly be moved aside without completely tarnishing his reputation, \u201cit\u2019s not a big deal to find the new guy. It\u2019s more a big deal to find the place for the previous guy.\u201d In Putin\u2019s Russia the president remains laser focused on winning in Ukraine, but recent overtures have shown that the supporting cast may change and the president is ready to be ruthless in his search of victory.

{"id": "2024_05_31_tech_fcc-affordable-connectivity-program-acp-close", "text": "The Affordable Connectivity Program, which helped low-income Americans get online, is no more. On Friday, the US government announced the final closure of the broadly popular federal program, which has helped tens of millions of households afford internet service, after Republicans in Congress ignored calls by consumer advocates and Democratic lawmakers to approve more funding this spring. The program\u2019s lapse threatens to throw nearly 60 million Americans into financial distress,\u00a0CNN has reported. The program officially ends on June 1, said the Federal Communications Commission, which administered the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) to approximately 1 in 5 households\u00a0across the country and\u00a0on tribal reservations. The 2.5-year-old ACP provided eligible low-income Americans with a monthly credit off their internet bills, worth up to $30 per month and as much as $75 per month for households on tribal lands. The pandemic-era program was a hit with members of both political parties and served tens of millions of seniors, veterans and rural and urban Americans alike. Program participants received\u00a0only partial benefits\u00a0in May ahead of the ACP\u2019s expected collapse. \u201cThe Affordable Connectivity Program filled an important gap that provider low-income programs, state and local affordability programs, and the Lifeline program cannot fully address,\u201d said FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel in a statement, referring to the name of another, similar FCC program that subsidizes wireless and home internet service. \u201cThe Commission is available to provide any assistance Congress may need to support funding the ACP in the future and stands ready to resume the program if additional funding is provided.\u201d Some US lawmakers proposed bipartisan legislation to extend the ACP in the months leading up to the deadline. But the bills languished in the face of inaction by Republican leaders who showed little interest in engaging with the issue. President Joe Biden and Democratic lawmakers have\u00a0publicly blamed\u00a0GOP leadership for allowing the ACP to end. A spokesperson for House Speaker Mike Johnson didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. On Friday, Biden reiterated his calls for Congress to pass legislation extending the ACP. He also announced a series of voluntary commitments by a handful of internet providers to offer \u2014 or continue offering \u2014 their own proprietary low-income internet plans.The list includes AT&T, Comcast, Cox, Charter\u2019s Spectrum and Verizon, among others. Those providers will continue to offer qualifying ACP households a broadband plan for $30 or less, the White House said, and together the companies are expected to cover roughly 10 million of the 23 million households relying on the ACP. The ACP was initially funded by Congress with a one-time budget of $14 billion. Biden has asked for $6 billion to continue the program and one bipartisan bill proposed renewing the ACP with $7 billion in additional funding. Kathryn de Wit, director of the Pew Charitable Trust\u2019s broadband access initiative, said reaching the deadline without a solution from Congress was a \u201cdisheartening\u201d outcome. \u201cWithout intervention, households participating in the program will immediately see their internet bills go up,\u201d de Wit said. \u201cWe know cost is a key barrier to connecting low-income families to the internet, so without ACP we can expect most participating households to either downgrade or drop their plans altogether.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/tech/fcc-affordable-connectivity-program-acp-close/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "world"}}

The flames consumed some 4,000 dunams (1,000 acres or 400 hectares) of the northern region, chief of the Tiberias fire station Boris Eisenberg said. Israel Fire and Rescue Services said multiple firefighting teams, including an air firefighting squadron, had been deployed, working through the night. On Tuesday, Israel Fire and Rescue Services in the north of the country dealt with two blazes. Twelve teams were deployed to Keren Naftali, where a fire had spread in several directions, while 10 teams had been deployed to the Biria Forest in the Upper Galilee area, where a falling Israeli interceptor missile caused a second blaze.  \u201cWe saw the interception and responded with increased forces and high intensity, we are operating on the spot and trying to contain the fire,\u201d spokesperson Uri Cohen told CNN. \u201cWe are dealing with extreme weather conditions, changing winds, high dryness with low humidity, high temperature. All these conditions together accelerate the development of the fire,\u201d Cohen said. By late Tuesday, all major fires in the north had been brought under control, according to the rescue authority. Authorities had begun evacuating residents as fires broke out at noon local time on Monday in the mountainous Galilee region, Israeli police said. Israeli police said they helped to evacuate homes in Kiryat Shmona, a northern city near the Lebanese border. The blazes came after authorities warned the public Monday that a heatwave was expected and cautioned against lighting fires in forests. Lebanon-based Islamist group Hezbollah said Monday that it launched a \u201cswarm of drones\u201d at an Israeli military command center in the Galilee, causing fires in the building. The group said they were a response to Israeli strikes on Hezbollah forces as well as homes in southern Lebanon, adding that three Hezbollah fighters were killed on Monday. Thousands of Israeli residents have been displaced after cross-border hostilities began between Hezbollah and the Israeli military in October. The Lebanese group said its attacks on northern Israel were in response to Israel\u2019s war in Gaza.

There are a few reasons why all of that matters. One: Tesla is America\u2019s best-selling EV, but it\u2019s losing market share overseas to foreign competitors that can make their cars cheaper. And while Tesla is an EV pioneer, it hasn\u2019t rolled out any significant innovations in recent years that would help justify its loftier price point. That\u2019s why BYD \u2014 which makes both EVs and hybrids \u2014 is now eating Tesla\u2019s lunch on the global stage. China is the world\u2019s biggest auto market, and BYD is its top seller, surpassing Volkswagen last year. On top of all that, BYD\u2019s sedans are cheap. The two models that will boast the new drivetrain start at around $14,000. (For comparison, the best-selling hybrid in the US, the Toyota Prius, starts at $28,000.) BYD\u2019s evolution from a small producer of clunkers to a global powerhouse brand has surprised its skeptics, including Musk, who roundly dismissed BYD in a 2011 Bloomberg interview. In that exchange, Musk responds to an honest question about BYD rivaling Tesla with a smug laugh. \u201cHave you seen their car?\u201d he asks the interviewer rhetorically. When the reporter presses him, he clarifies that he thinks BYD\u2019s product is not \u201cparticularly attractive\u201d and that the technology is \u201cnot very strong.\u201d Of course, a lot happened in the decade that followed, and Musk ate his words this January, saying on an earnings call that he believes Chinese EV makers could \u201cpretty much demolish most other car companies in the world\u201d unless stronger trade barriers are put in place. (They were two weeks ago.) Meanwhile, BYD has another edge that Tesla lacks: It makes hybrids. Hybrid cars like the Prius were supposed to be the short-lived stepping stone to our all-electric future. But in the United States, at least, EV sales are flagging in part because the nation\u2019s roads lack the infrastructure to support them. EV ranges have come a long way \u2014 most get more than 300 miles of range per charge, which is more than most people would drive before stopping even in a traditional car. Problem is, we don\u2019t have enough charging stations along the roads or within cities to make customers comfortable with the idea. The top reason US customers won\u2019t consider an EV \u2014 cited by 52% of consumers in a recent JD Power survey \u2014 is lack of charging station availability. Instead, we\u2019re buying more hybrids, which are largely cheaper than EVs, reduce the cost of fuel over the long term and are ever so slightly better for the environment than regular engines. (Emphasis on slightly\u2026 Hybrids still run on fossil fuels, they\u2019re not doing much to help the world meet its climate goals the way mass adoption of EVs would.) For now, Tesla and other US carmakers are being thoroughly shielded from Chinese competition via strict tariffs and major regulatory hurdles. But it\u2019s not clear how long those protections will hold if American consumers begin demanding the cheaper options available overseas.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/tech/elon-musk-byd-china-nightcap/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_03_weather_california-heat-dome-wildfires-west-climate", "text": "Daily temperature records will tumble as sizzling early season heat from a summerlike heat dome sends thermometers skyrocketing into the triple digits in parts of California and the West this week. The official start of summer is just a few weeks away, but it will feel like July in much of the West as temperatures climb 20 degrees or more above average, the highest temperatures of the year so far for many locations. Excessive heat warnings are in effect for more than 17 million people in California, Nevada, Utah and Arizona this week. The warnings are the most extreme form of heat alert issued by the National Weather Service and are used when widespread, dangerous heat is expected. The soaring temperatures are being caused by a heat dome, a large area of high pressure that parks over an area, traps air and heats it with abundant sunshine for days or weeks. The resulting heat becomes more intense the longer a heat dome lasts. TELL US: Worried about affording air conditioning this summer? Share your story Dangerous heat will get underway Tuesday afternoon in parts of California and expand its reach into more of the Southwest by Wednesday and as a heat dome parks over the West. It will then reach the Pacific Northwest by late-week. The most extreme heat will avoid major population centers along the coast, but Los Angeles will still be 5 to 10 degrees warmer than normal this week. Temperatures will soar into the upper 90s and low 100s Tuesday in California\u2019s Central Valley \u2013 including where the Corral Fire is burning near Tracy. Sacramento is forecast to hit triple digits Tuesday for the first time this year. California\u2019s capital typically hits this threshold in early June, but last year it didn\u2019t happen until the end of the month. Triple-digit temperatures will become widespread in the Central Valley Wednesday and stick around into the weekend. Conditions will also sizzle in Southern California\u2019s desert regions. Death Valley, the hottest place in the world, is likely to reach a high temperature of at least 120 degrees by Thursday. Even the brutal desert landscape doesn\u2019t typically get this hot until mid-to-late June. The Southwest will start to bake by Wednesday as temperatures in parts of southern Arizona and far southern Nevada approach 110 degrees. Phoenix will likely have hit 110 degrees for the first time this year by Thursday even though the city doesn\u2019t typically encounter these temperatures until mid-June. High temperatures are forecast to climb into the low 110s in Las Vegas, more than three weeks earlier than the city typically exceeds this threshold. The early summerlike heat will threaten daily high temperature records across a significant portion of the West this week. Phoenix; Las Vegas; Flagstaff, Arizona; Reno, Nevada; and Fresno, California, are just a handful of cities where the day\u2019s high temperature record could fall. By Friday, records could be broken in parts of Oregon, Washington, Idaho and Colorado as heat expands north and east. Fire danger will also rise while the heat is at its peak. Sizzling temperatures and low levels of humidity will dry out short-fuse fuels such as grasses and brush, making them more prone to burn. Breezy winds will develop at times, especially in California into midweek. The combination of these factors will make it easier for fires to ignite and spread. Corral Fire blazing in California\u2019s Central Valley The Corral Fire has consumed more than 14,000 acres of land in California\u2019s San Joaquin county since it ignited south of Tracy Saturday afternoon. Residents were ordered to evacuate over the weekend as the fire \u2013 initially fueled by gusty winds and dry, hot conditions \u2013 threatened communities. Firefighters gained an upper hand as winds eased Sunday and Monday and the blaze was\u00a090% contained by Tuesday morning, according to CAL Fire. Evacuation warnings were lifted Monday evening as containment increased, according to CAL Fire. Officials urged residents to remain vigilant and be ready for potential changes to the fire risk level. Two Alameda County firefighters were injured while responding to the\u00a0fire,\u00a0Cal Fire Battalion Chief Josh Silveira told CNN early Sunday morning. They had minor to moderate injuries and were transported to a local hospital for evaluation and treatment, Silveira said. A section of I-580 was closed in both directions over the weekend as the fire\u2019s thick smoke enveloped the roadway. All lanes were reopened Sunday night, according to the California Department of Transportation. The cause of the fire is under investigation, according to CAL Fire. Gusty winds up to 30 mph are possible Tuesday, which could complicate ongoing containment efforts. Temperatures will also surge well into the 90s from Tuesday through the weekend. An excessive heat warning is in effect for the region from Tuesday through Thursday.

ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski was the first to report. ESPN and The Athletic are reporting the Lakers are preparing a lucrative, long-term contract to fill the team\u2019s coaching vacancy. A UConn spokesperson told CNN Hurley did not have a comment. Hurley has led the Huskies to back-to-back national titles. He holds an impressive 141-58 record in six seasons at the helm in Storrs.

{"id": "2024_06_03_americas_mexico-claudia-sheinbaum-profile-intl-hnk", "text": "Known as \u201cla Doctora\u201d for her glittering academic credentials, Claudia Sheinbaum is a physicist with a doctorate in energy engineering, the former mayor of one of the world\u2019s most populous cities, and was part of the United Nations panel of climate scientists that received a Nobel Peace Prize. And on Sunday, she became the first woman, and the first Jewish person, to be elected president of Mexico. Sheinbaum won around 60% of the vote in the largest election in Mexico\u2019s history, marking a historic achievement in a mostly Catholic country known for its deeply patriarchal culture. The 61-year-old is set to replace the outgoing President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, her longtime ally whose social welfare programs lifted many Mexicans out of poverty, making their leftist Morena party favorite in the polls. \u201cOur duty is and will always be to look after every single Mexican without distinction,\u201d Sheinbaum said in a speech early Monday morning. \u201cEven though many Mexicans do not fully agree with our project, we will have to walk in peace and harmony to continue building a fair and more prosperous Mexico.\u201d After her maternal grandparents emigrated from Europe to escape the Holocaust, Sheinbaum was born in Mexico City in 1962 \u2013 a city she would go on to serve in various roles across decades. While studying for her undergraduate degree at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), she became immersed in student politics, protesting against the privatization of public education. After graduating, she studied energy engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, where she became fluent in English and earned a Master\u2019s degree, before returning to UNAM for doctoral studies. Sheinbaum entered politics in 2000, when she was appointed environment secretary of Mexico City by Obrador, then the head of the city\u2019s government. After leaving the role in 2006, Sheinbaum committed herself to the study of energy, joining the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and becoming part of the team that received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007. In 2015, she became the first woman elected head of the Tlalpan district of Mexico City, serving until 2017. The next year, she was elected head of the government of the whole city \u2013 again, the first woman to do so \u2013 only stepping down in June 2023 to embark on her run for president. Sheinbaum has two children and one grandchild. Her partner, Jes\u00fas Mar\u00eda Tarriba, whom she met at university while both were studying physics, is a financial risk specialist at the Bank of Mexico. What challenges lie ahead? Had the constitution allowed it, Mexico would likely have re-elected Obrador, one of those rare politicians who \u2013 like FDR and JFK \u2013 is known simply by his initials, AMLO. After riding the wave of AMLO\u2019s popularity, some have questioned whether Sheinbaum will be able to distance herself sufficiently from her longtime ally. One of Sheinbaum\u2019s biographers, journalist Jorge Zepeda, has argued that, once in office, Sheinbaum will likely unfurl her own platform gradually: she will first act as \u201cthe faithful disciple of the leader,\u201d before offering \u201cglimpses\u201d of her own program, taking care not to stoke instability in the movement\u2019s base. But Zepeda has also noted clear differences between the two leaders. In an article for the Spanish daily El Pais, Zepeda recalled asking Sheinbaum what sets her apart from other politicians. \u201cI\u2019m someone who makes decisions based on the data,\u201d she told him. By contrast, Zepeda claimed Obrador could sacrifice data for party loyalty. \u201cIf (a piece of) data gets in the way, another piece is chosen,\u201d he said, whereas Sheinbaum allows herself to be guided by the science. Obrador will leave office with broad support and an impressive record of alleviating poverty, but his premiership was marred by his \u201chugs, not bullets\u201d policy of not confronting cartels, allowing violence to spiral. Violence has loomed large in this election, the bloodiest in Mexico\u2019s history. Dozens of political candidates and applicants have been killed by criminal organizations\u00a0trying to influence\u00a0those coming into power. Mexico\u2019s\u00a0homicide rate\u00a0is among the highest in the world, and\u00a0more than 100,000 people remain missing in the country. It also remains a dangerous place to be a woman, with\u00a0sky-high femicide\u00a0rates for\u00a0the region \u2013 with figures showing around 10 women\u00a0are murdered every day. Sheinbaum will have to act quickly on Mexico\u2019s organized crime and security issues, said Will Freeman, a fellow for Latin America studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cIt\u2019s stunning that the governing party could win re-election by a landslide as it seems\u2026 given the sweeping violence, the thing is the opposition didn\u2019t seem to put\u00a0together a much more credible\u00a0set of proposals about what\u00a0they would do,\u201d Freeman said. Sheinbaum comes with a team from her time as Mexico City mayor that has a proven record on improving security but it remains to be seen if she can replicate that on a national scale, Freeman said. US-Mexico relations Both Mexico and the US are holding elections in 2024, something that happens only once every 12 years \u2013 and comes at a time of transition in the relationship between the two countries. Sheinbaum will assume office just a month before Americans head to the polls in November, where immigration is a top issue on the ballot for Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Mexico is a key US ally on a range of issues, from trade to cracking down on drug trafficking to managing migration. Current and former US officials have frequently described the relationship between President Joe Biden and Mexico\u2019s President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador as friendly and professional \u2014 and anticipate a productive relationship with Mexico\u2019s next president. But Mexico\u2019s election also comes at a critical time for the Biden administration. In recent months, the US has relied heavily on Mexico to step up immigration enforcement and help stem the flow of migration to the US southern border. The election in Mexico has raised uncertainty in the minds of some Biden officials about what, if anything, will change with a key partner when it comes to border cooperation. One of the considerations in rolling out a new border executive action was doing so after Mexico\u2019s election. The administration will likely need buy-in and assistance from Mexico to execute the order. Officials expect that a new administration in Mexico would likely continue cooperating with the US on migration given years of partnership, but it\u2019s unclear how migrants \u2014 and especially, smugglers \u2014 might plot their next moves in a moment of government transition.

{"id": "2024_06_05_europe_putin-russia-western-nations-ukraine-intl-hnk", "text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned Western countries they\u2019re taking a \u201cvery serious and dangerous step\u201d by supplying weapons to Ukraine, which could result in Moscow arming their enemies. Ukraine has relied heavily on arms supplied by Western allies to beat back Russian forces since Putin\u2019s full-scale invasion began more than two years ago. And last week, US President Joe Biden for the first time gave Kyiv permission to use American munitions to carry out limited strikes inside Russian territory, after several European nations removed restrictions on how weapons they supply can be used. \u201cSupplying weapons to a conflict zone is always a bad thing,\u201d Putin told editors from international news agencies on the sidelines of the annual economic forum in St. Petersburg on Wednesday. \u201cEspecially if this is linked to the fact that those who supply them are not only delivering weapons but managing them.\u201d Putin also warned that Russia could retaliate if Western countries are deemed to have become directly involved in the Ukraine conflict. \u201cIn the end, if we see that these countries become involved in a war against us, what they are doing makes them directly involved in a war against the Russian Federation, we reserve the right to act the same way,\u201d he said. \u201cOverall, it leads to some serious problems.\u201d And he raised the prospect of retaliatory action\u00a0by asking why Russia would \u201cnot have the right to supply our weapons of the same class to those regions of the world where there will be strikes on the sensitive facilities of those countries that are doing this against Russia?\u201d The Ukrainian military has started using US-supplied HIMARS rocket systems to hit Russian air defense systems, weapons depots and other military targets\u00a0on Russian territory, a member of the Ukrainian Parliament told CNN on Wednesday. Yehor Cherniev, deputy chairman of the Ukrainian Parliament\u2019s Committee on National Security, Defense and Intelligence,\u00a0said the American weapons had allowed them \u201cto significantly reduce the shelling of Kharkiv by Russian S-300 missiles.\u201d In his comments Wednesday, Putin said Russia would improve air defense systems to destroy incoming missiles. He also singled out Berlin for criticism, following remarks last week from the leaders of France and Germany that Ukraine should be allowed to use their weapons against targets inside Russia from which Moscow attacks Ukraine. The appearance of German tanks in Ukraine had resulted in an \u201cethical shock\u201d in Russia, where the attitude toward Germany had previously been \u201cvery good,\u201d Putin said. \u201cNow, when they say that some more missiles will appear that will strike targets on Russian territory, this, of course, is ultimately destroying Russo-German relations,\u201d he added. Speaking alongside French President Emmanuel Macron on May 28, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Ukraine was allowed to defend itself as long as it respected the conditions given by the countries that supplied the weapons \u2013 including the United States \u2013 and international law. \u201cUkraine has every possibility under international law for what it is doing. That has to be said explicitly,\u201d Scholz said. \u201cI find it strange when some people argue that it should not be allowed to defend itself and take measures that are suitable for this.\u201d Ukraine had for months pleaded with Washington to allow it to strike targets on Russian soil with US weapons, as Moscow launched a brutal aerial and ground assault on Kharkiv, knowing that its troops could retreat to Russian soil to regroup and its weapons depots could not be targeted with Western arms. The US is standing firm in not allowing Ukraine to use the most formidable munition it has been given to fire into Russia: the long-range missiles known as ATACMS that can hit targets 300 kilometers (nearly 200 miles) away. Instead, Ukraine can only use shorter-range missiles known as GMLRS, which have a range of around 70 kilometers (around 40 miles).", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/europe/putin-russia-western-nations-ukraine-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "world"}}

In a press statement to CNN, Chanel confirmed Viard\u2019s departure, writing that while the 62-year-old designer was at the helm, \u201cshe was able to renew the codes of the house while respecting the creative heritage of Chanel, and almost thirty years within the house.\u201d A successor has yet to be named, but the brand added that an announcement would be made \u201cin due course.\u201d Chanel said that it wanted to thank Viard \u201cfor her remarkable contribution to Chanel\u2019s fashion, creativity and vitality.\u201d Just last month, Chanel\u2019s chief executive Leena Nair told The Business of Fashion that \u201csince Virginie took over from Karl\u2026 the Chanel fashion business has multiplied by 2.2.

The blaze was still burning on Wednesday afternoon, more than 24 hours after it began, and authorities and citizens in the Danish capital have started reckoning with the loss of one of the city\u2019s most recognizable landmarks. Local firefighters continued to try to put out the fire, which ripped through\u00a0the building \u2013 known locally as B\u00f8rsen \u2013\u00a0from early Tuesday, reaching all its floors and causing the collapse of a dragon-tail spire that had long been a symbol of the city. The walls of the building are still standing, but the interior has been significantly damaged and the roof is partially collapsed. Firefighters used cranes to hose water down into the building. Copenhagen\u00a0police meanwhile launched an investigation on Wednesday, which they said will be a \u201ccomplicated process.\u201d Police officer Brian Belling said authorities have already \u201cconducted interviews, secured surveillance and carried out a large number of investigative steps.\u201d \u201cBut of course, there is still a lot to do, especially as we have not yet had the opportunity to examine\u00a0B\u00f8rsen itself,\u201d Belling added. The 17th century building exemplified the style of the Dutch Renaissance, and housed a number of artworks, some of which were saved on Tuesday. Residents were stunned by the outbreak, which brought back memories of the fire that tore through the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris exactly five years and a day earlier. \u201cMy first thought was (that) I hope that they rebuild it \u2013 it\u2019s never going to be the same but it\u2019s iconic to\u00a0Copenhagen\u00a0and Denmark,\u201d teacher Eva Simoni Lomholdt, 58, told Reuters. Brian Mikkelsen, the CEO of the Danish Chamber of Commerce which owns the building, told the news agency that a firefighter gave him the top of the spire on Wednesday morning after it was recovered following its fall. \u201cIt gives me hope because we have decided to rebuild the stock exchange because it\u2019s part of European history as a trading continent,\u201d he said. The old stock exchange \u2013 located only a few minutes walk from Christiansborg\u00a0Palace \u2013 dates back to 1625. It was built in the Dutch Renaissance style at the request of King Christian IV and had recently been undergoing renovations with its facade covered in scaffolding and protective coverings. It has been at the heart of Danish business since then; while it no longer houses the Danish stock exchange, it serves as the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce. Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said Tuesday a \u201cpiece of Danish history\u201d was on fire, calling the building \u201cirreplaceable.\u201d Denmark\u2019s culture minister Jakob Engel-Schmidt added that 400 years of cultural heritage had been damaged. \u201cHow touching it is to see how the employees at B\u00f8rsen, good people from the emergency services and passers-by work together to rescue art treasures and iconic images from the burning building,\u201d he said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/17/style/copenhagen-stock-exchange-fire-police-investigation-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "world"}}

The Ukrainian authorities released several photographs of Gorilyk, 40, on Wednesday to show the toll they say Russian captivity has taken on him. \u201cThe condition of Roman and other Ukrainian prisoners of war evokes horror and associations with the darkest pages of human history \u2013 Nazi concentration death camps,\u201d the Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War, a Ukrainian government body, said in a statement posted on Telegram alongside the photos. The National Guard of Ukraine told CNN that almost all of the released prisoners have suffered weight loss, sores and lesions and chronic conditions stemming from untreated injuries. Ukrainian presidential adviser\u00a0Mykhailo Podolyak said the prisoners returned to Ukraine in a \u201chorrifying\u201d state. \u201cThe torture by starvation is monstrous, the beatings and violence are sophisticated,\u201d he said in a statement posted on X, accusing Russia of ignoring international human rights agreements. \u201cThere are no Geneva Conventions anymore\u2026 Russia again thinks it can avoid being held accountable for massive war crimes,\u201d he said. CNN has asked the Russian Ministry of Defense for comment. Under the Geneva Conventions, the set of international laws that regulate armed conflict, prisoners of war must be treated humanely and with dignity, and must be provided with basic daily food rations that are \u201csufficient in quantity, quality and variety to keep prisoners of war in good health and to prevent loss of weight or the development of nutritional deficiencies.\u201d The Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War said Gorilyk was among 169 guards who were taken by the invading Russian forces and transported to Russia via Belarus. It said that 89 of these people are still being held captive, and that Moscow is using them in exchange for Russian servicemen captured in battle.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/europe/emaciated-ukrainian-pow-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_middleeast_israel-top-court-sde-teiman-hearing-intl", "text": "Israel has transferred hundreds of Palestinian detainees out of the shadowy detention facility of Sde Teiman in Israel\u2019s Negev desert, a state attorney told Israel\u2019s Supreme Court on Wednesday during a first-ever hearing about the facility where prisoners from Gaza have allegedly been held under conditions of extreme abuse. State attorney Aner Helman told the court that 700 inmates had been moved to Ofer military facility in the occupied West Bank, with another 500 set to be transferred in the weeks to come. Around 200 detainees will remain in Sde Teiman, said Helman, who added that the state would provide an update on their status within three days. The hearing comes in response to a petition by the Association for Civil Rights in Israel (ACRI) and other human rights groups, which drew heavily on CNN reporting about the makeshift prison to make a case for it to be shut down. During a tense exchange, one of the Supreme Court justices, Judge Barak Erez, pressed the state\u2019s legal team on the legality of the way the facility was being run. \u201cThe question is whether or not the Israeli law for the imprisonment of unlawful combatants applies or not. That you did not answer,\u201d said Erez. Avi Segal, an attorney representing the right-wing, Israeli legal organization Shurat HaDin which had asked to join the procedure, said the hearing was based on \u201cnewspaper rumors.\u201d \u201cThe court should be worried about setting up a hearing, and even asking for a response to petitions based on newspaper rumors,\u201d said Segal. CNN\u2019s investigation, in which Israeli whistleblowers as well as Palestinian former detainees and eyewitnesses described horrific conditions at the facility, including continuous blindfolding and handcuffing, sparked an international outcry. The White House called the allegations detailed in CNN\u2019s report \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d and said it was reaching out to Israeli officials for answers. Germany\u2019s Foreign Office condemned the reported practices and said it was campaigning for the International Committee of the Red Cross to access the camp and other prisons. In the wake of CNN\u2019s investigation, United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture and Unlawful Combatants, Alice Jill Edwards, called for Israel to investigate allegations of\u00a0torture and\u00a0mistreatment of detained Palestinians. Last week, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi said the military launched a probe into the allegations of mistreatment at Sde Teiman, as well as at Anatot and Ofer, two other military detention camps for Palestinians from Gaza. The committee tasked with examining the conditions of Palestinian detainees from Gaza is set to submit its recommendations to Halevi this month. \u201cThey cannot keep holding people there, not even for a short while, not even only 200, and not even one week,\u201d ACRI\u2019s attorney Roni Pelli told CNN after the hearing. Since the start of the war on October 7, 36 prisoners held at military detention camps have died, according to the IDF spokesperson\u2019s office. The dead included prisoners \u201cwith previous illnesses or injuries caused to them as a result of the ongoing hostilities,\u201d the statement said. \u201cIn accordance with the law and IDF directives, in each case of death of a detainee in an IDF detention facility, a criminal investigation is opened by the Military Police,\u201d the statement added. On May 10, CNN released an investigation into Sde Teiman, a military base in the Negev desert which has doubled as a detention center for Palestinians detained over the course of Israel\u2019s\u00a0war in\u00a0Gaza which was launched after the October 7 Hamas-led attack on Israel. Three Israeli whistleblowers told CNN that Palestinian detainees at the facility were constantly blindfolded and held under extreme physical restraint. Doctors sometimes amputated prisoners\u2019 limbs due to injuries sustained from continuous handcuffing, one whistleblower said.\u00a0The account tallied with details of\u00a0a letter authored by a doctor\u00a0working at\u00a0Sde Teiman published by Ha\u2019aretz\u00a0in April. According to the accounts, the camp some 18 miles from the Gaza frontier is split into two parts: enclosures holding scores of detainees from Gaza, and a field hospital where wounded detainees are blindfolded, strapped to their beds, wearing diapers and fed through straws. In a May 20 response to a petition led by the rights group Public Committee Against Torture in Israel (PCATI), the Israeli government said it is set to \u201creduce the number of inmates held in military facilities in general and the facility of Sde Teiman in particular, with the intention that this facility will be used as a reception, interrogation and initial sorting facility, for keeping prisoners for short periods only.\u201d Responding to CNN\u2019s request for comment on all the allegations made in its May 10 report, the Israeli military, known as the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), said in a statement: \u201cThe IDF ensures proper conduct towards the detainees in custody. Any allegation of misconduct by IDF soldiers is examined and dealt with accordingly. In appropriate cases, MPCID (Military Police Criminal Investigation\u2019s Division) investigations are opened when there is suspicion of misconduct justifying such action.\u201d \u201cDetainees are handcuffed based on their risk level and health status. Incidents of unlawful handcuffing are not known to the authorities.\u201d The IDF did not directly deny accounts of people being stripped of their clothing or held in diapers. Instead, the Israeli military said that the detainees are given back their clothing once the IDF has determined that they pose no security risk.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/middleeast/israel-top-court-sde-teiman-hearing-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "world"}}

The announcement comes after US President Joe Biden unveiled executive action that would bar people who cross the US-Mexico border illegally from requesting asylum, during periods when there is a high volume of illegal crossings. Unless they meet certain exemptions, the asylum-seekers would be turned away to Mexico or returned to their home countries. The\u00a0president\u2019s proclamation, announced Tuesday, still allows for the normal flow of commerce and legal immigration across the border. Asked whether Biden\u2019s plan could lead to a potential increase of migrants on the Mexican side of the border, Mexico\u2019s president said, \u201cWe are seeking an agreement that if they (the US) make the decision to deport, they do so directly.\u201d L\u00f3pez Obrador added that he is not worried about Mexican border towns being overwhelmed by asylum seekers pushed back by the US. \u201cThey come to Mexico. We have no problem. We treat them all very well (\u2026) but why not a direct agreement?\u201d he said. Biden and L\u00f3pez Obrador also held a phone call on Tuesday, which the Mexican president described as \u201crespectful\u201d and \u201cvery amicable,\u201d saying they spoke about the need to support Latin American nations. A \u2018virtual wall\u2019 While some critics argue Biden\u2019s sweeping migration measure\u00a0doesn\u2019t go far enough in responding to the large numbers of people showing up at the US southern border, others warn that closing the\u00a0border\u00a0to\u00a0asylum\u00a0seekers\u00a0will endanger vulnerable people. In practice, the new rule would imply \u201cclosing the border\u201d to the thousands of refugees who are in Mexico waiting to reach the United States, Tonatiuh Guill\u00e9n, professor at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) and former commissioner of the National Migration Institute of Mexico, told CNN. \u201cIt implies a kind of virtual wall because people are going to be in a scenario where they are going to be rejected. On the other hand, if this measure is implemented, it leaves thousands of people without the possibility of shelter,\u201d Guillen said. Mexican authorities have largely played down any expected impact. A source at Mexico\u2019s asylum commission COMAR also told CNN that the agency is not very concerned about a potential increase in refugee applications \u201cbecause normally, the migrants who reached the northern border of Mexico are not interested in requesting asylum in Mexico.\u201d L\u00f3pez Obrador said what he \u201cliked the most\u201d about his call with Biden was the US\u2019 plan to build three new border bridges. \u201cThis is going to help a lot in the economic and commercial development throughout the region,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/americas/mexicos-us-deportation-country-of-origin-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_29_tech_ransomware-attacks-hospitals-patients-danger", "text": "A ransomware attack on a major US hospital network that began three weeks ago is endangering patients\u2019 health as nurses are forced to manually enter prescription information and work without electronic health records, nurses at two hospitals affected by the cyberattack told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s putting patients\u2019 lives in danger,\u201d said a nurse who works at Ascension Providence Rochester Hospital, a 290-bed facility about 25 miles north of downtown Detroit. \u201cPeople have too many patients for what is safe. Nurses are taking on five or six patients dealing with all of this paper charting.\u201d Another nurse, who works who works at a 409-bed Ascension hospital in Birmingham, Alabama, told CNN: \u201cIt is frightening how many safety guardrails [have been] out of service without any computers.\u201d The nurses spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect their jobs. The cyberattack hit Ascension, a St. Louis-based nonprofit that oversees 140 hospitals across 19 states, on May 8, but the healthcare network is still working to bring its systems back online. Ransomware attacks that cut off access to electronic health records are a grimly regular occurrence in American life. The health care sector\u00a0reported\u00a0249 ransomware attacks to the FBI last year, more than any other sector, with some cases affecting patient records. But the Ascension incident is raising concerns about the threat to patient health posed by cybercriminals in a way that numerous other ransomware attacks on US health providers haven\u2019t, according to interviews with nurses and cybersecurity experts. The two Ascension nurses said in separate interviews that they felt overwhelmed by the abrupt shift to paper records following the cyberattack, underwhelmed by their hospitals\u2019 plans for dealing with the situation and worried that they or their colleagues will make mistakes entering a patient\u2019s vital medical information. \u201cI don\u2019t have any orders in the computer,\u201d the Rochester, Michigan-based nurse said. \u201cI can\u2019t see what labs are ordered and their results.\u201d OPEIU Local 40, a union that represents nurses at Ascension Providence Rochester Hospital, distributed an online\u00a0petition\u00a0on Friday saying union members were \u201cdeeply concerned about the current challenges faced by our healthcare professionals\u201d because of the cyberattack, and urged the hospital to take a series of remediating steps, including limiting the nurse-to-patient ratio. Mac Walker, Ascension\u2019s director of media relations, did not answer CNN\u2019s questions about the petition or the nurses\u2019 comments on patient safety. Instead, Walker emailed this statement on Wednesday morning. \u201cRestoring EHR [electronic health records] access has been among the top priorities of our recovery process,\u201d Walker said. \u201cDue to the hard work of our teams over the past several days, we have successfully restored EHR access in our first market and are actively progressing against a plan to restore access across our network on a rolling basis.\u201d Walker did not respond when asked what Ascension\u2019s \u201cfirst market\u201d meant. Ascension, the fourth largest hospital network in the country\u00a0by some measures, said in a public statement Friday that it has been working\u00a0\u201caround the clock with industry-leading cybersecurity experts to safely restore operations across our network.\u201d In the wake of the Ascension hack and another ransomware attack in February that disrupted insurance billing at pharmacies across the US, Biden administration officials say they\u00a0are preparing\u00a0to release a set of minimum cybersecurity requirements for US hospitals.\u00a0But the cybersecurity challenges in the health sector are legion and beyond the scope of any one policy prescription, experts say. Senior officials from the White House and Department of Health and Human Services plan to meet with cybersecurity executives from health care companies on Wednesday to discuss how to better protect hospitals from hackers, three sources familiar with the meeting told CNN. \u2018Exorbitant\u2019 wait times for lab results In statements to the press, Ascension has said that its staff are \u201cappropriately trained to maintain high quality care during downtime.\u201d But the nurses interviewed by CNN say that the shift to paper records and manual operations is taking a toll on hospital operations. With computers down, doctors have been writing paper prescriptions for patients that nurses take to a machine to manually enter without a cross-check from the local pharmacy, according to the two nurses. \u201cThey have to put an override in there to get the medication out,\u201d said Dina Carlisle, president of OPEIU Local 40. \u201cThere\u2019s no second safety check from the pharmacy.\u201d It has also taken an exorbitantly long time to get lab results because of the hack, the nurse in Birmingham, Alabama, told CNN. A \u201cstat lab,\u201d or lab work needed to make quick decisions on patient care, that normally takes 30 minutes to an hour to process has taken hours, the nurse said. A growing problem for hospitals Ransomware attacks in the US\u00a0routinely force hospitals\u00a0to divert ambulances and cancel appointments. That causes a strain on neighboring hospitals that pick up the slack. But a lack of clear public understanding of how cyberattacks on hospitals directly impact patient care is undercutting the urgency needed to deal with the problem, according to health advocates and cybersecurity experts. Researchers are increasingly quantifying how lethal ransomware can be. Roughly 3 in 100 hospitalized Medicare patients will die in the hospital under normal conditions, but during a ransomware attack, that number increases to 4 out of 100 because of the strain on hospital resources,\u00a0according\u00a0to scholars at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health, who studied 374 ransomware attacks on health providers. Part of the problem,\u00a0experts say, is that some hospitals have failed basic tests of cybersecurity \u201chygiene,\u201d or sound defensive measures, while many small clinics lack the resources to secure themselves. And, perhaps more than any other sector, health care firms hold an enormous volume of sensitive data that is ripe for targeting and extortion schemes. The number of sensitive data records held by the health care sector grew by more than 63% last year \u201cfar surpassing any other industry and more than five times the global average,\u201d according to a study by security firm Rubrik. In February, cybercriminals broke into an unsecured computer server used by Change Healthcare, an insurance billing giant that processes about 15 billion health care transactions annually. The hack cut off health care providers from billions of dollars of revenue and snarled service at pharmacies across the US. Andrew Witty, the CEO of\u00a0UnitedHealth Group, which owns Change Healthcare,\u00a0apologized\u00a0in a recent congressional hearing for the security lapse and said he authorized a $22 million ransom payment to hackers to try to protect patient data. Yet a third of Americans could have had their data stolen in the hack, he said. \u201cWe routinely decline healthcare entities unwilling to address things like unpatched critical vulnerabilities, misconfigurations or uneven application of MFA [multi-factor authentication] \u2014 the very things hackers leverage to breach systems. And then we regularly see them breached later,\u201d Sezaneh Seymour, head of regulatory risk and policy at cyber insurance firm Coalition, told CNN. (She said her firm had no specific insights into the Change Healthcare or Ascension ransomware attacks.) Health care providers also make attractive targets for cyber extortionists because hospitals can ill-afford to be offline for long because of the disruptions it causes to operations. \u201cWhen we look at ransomware targeting, it\u2019s: who is the most easily targetable, who can afford little downtime and who has the highest willingness to pay,\u201d Bryan Vorndran, the FBI\u2019s senior most cyber-focused official, said in an interview. \u201cAnd where there\u2019s low-downtime environments, you have obviously a willingness to pay more so than in environments where they can afford downtime,\u201d Vorndran told CNN. \u201cI think all of that is relevant not just to the healthcare sector but to some other sectors as well.\u201d He declined to comment when asked about the Ascension hack.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/tech/ransomware-attacks-hospitals-patients-danger/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "world"}}

Temperatures Thursday will top out up to 25 degrees above what\u2019s normal for the time of the year, making it feel like a hot July day in many locations. Heat will continue through the weekend before easing off a bit early next week. However, many typically hot areas in the West will still have to contend with temperatures up to 10 degrees above normal. A robust heat dome \u2013 a large area of high pressure that parks over an area, traps air and heats it with abundant sunshine for days or weeks \u2013 is driving this prolonged, unseasonable heat. TRACK IT: Where the heat will be hottest this week The temperatures will be dangerous for those exposed to the elements and unable to cool off.\u00a0Relief from the heat won\u2019t be found at night, either \u2013 another symptom of a world warming\u00a0due to fossil fuel pollution. Excessive heat warnings are in effect for more than 18 million people in California, Nevada, Arizona and Utah. A majority of these warnings, which are the most extreme form of heat alert issued by the National Weather Service, remain active through Friday. Heat has already taken its toll. Multiple people in different parts of the US have died due to heat-related illnesses since last weekend. Four migrants died \u201cfrom heat stroke and dehydration\u201d while triple digit temperatures baked the US-Mexico border last weekend, according to the US Border Patrol, El Paso Sector. In the East, a 59-year-old man died of heat-related complications in Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland, officials said Wednesday. Additional details about the man\u2019s death, which was the state\u2019s first heat-related death of the year, were not released. Heat also proved challenging for firefighters battling a blaze in California\u2019s Napa County Wednesday. Four firefighters were sent to area hospitals for injuries related to difficult terrain and \u201chot summer conditions,\u201d according to\u00a0CAL Fire\u2019s Sonoma-Lake-Napa Unit. All four are expected to make full recoveries. More than a dozen daily high temperature records fell earlier this week in the West as the heat dome strengthened. A few dozen more could be broken through the weekend. Phoenix; Las Vegas; Flagstaff, Arizona; Reno, Nevada; and Fresno, California, are just a handful of cities where the day\u2019s high temperature record could fall on one or more days this week. Phoenix sizzled Wednesday but fell just short of its first 110-degree day of the year, a threshold it will likely blow past Thursday. High temperatures are forecast to climb into the low 110s in Las Vegas, likely tying this year with 2010 for the earliest such reading on record in the city. Death Valley, the hottest place in the world, will likely reach a high temperature of at least 120 degrees Thursday. Even the brutal desert landscape doesn\u2019t typically get this hot until mid-to-late June. Triple-digit temperatures will persist in California\u2019s Central Valley into the weekend with 110s sticking around in desert areas of California, Nevada and Arizona. Summerlike heat will expand northward Friday and reach the Northwest. Records could be broken in parts of Oregon, Washington and Idaho from Friday through the weekend. While it won\u2019t be record-breaking, Seattle will contend with high temperatures in the upper 70s Friday and could come close to 80 degrees on Saturday.

{"id": "2024_06_05_africa_aliko-dangote-oil-refinery-nigeria-spc", "text": "Over the past eight years, Aliko Dangote, Africa\u2019s richest man, has built one of the world\u2019s largest oil refineries. Spanning nearly 4,000 football fields, construction of the refinery began in 2016 at the Lekki Free Zone outside of Lagos, Nigeria, and it opened in May 2023. Dangote\u2019s company says the plant will have the capability to produce 650,000 barrels per day once fully operational. Nigeria is one of Africa\u2019s largest oil producers, yet the country has lacked the capability to refine its oil forcing it to rely on imported fuel. With the opening of this refinery, Dangote Industries Ltd., a massive conglomerate that also operates cement plants, a fertilizer plant, and sugar refinery, says it aims to process enough oil to not only make Nigeria self-sufficient but supply petrol, diesel, and jet fuel to other African countries. Now that the $19 billion facility is complete, Dangote stressed it will take time for local oil producers to shift away from relying on overseas refineries, but it\u2019s a challenge he\u2019s confident he can overcome: \u201cI\u2019ve been fighting battles all my life, so I don\u2019t get scared of anything,\u201d he told CNN. In May, CNN\u2019s Eleni Giokos got an inside look at the refinery and spoke with Dangote about what it took to bring this massive project to life and what impact it will have within the continent. The following interview has been edited for length and clarity. CNN: Do local oil companies, oil producers want to sell crude to you? Aliko Dangote: Nobody thought we were going to appear in this industry. So with that, we know there are challenges and that\u2019s the truth, I have to be very open to you, but NNPC, [Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation], they\u2019ve been very helpful. They do their own bit, but some of the IOCs [international oil companies] they\u2019re struggling to give us crude because everybody\u2019s used to exporting and nobody wants to stop exporting, which does not make sense. CNN: What\u2019s the timeline of Nigeria being completely self-sufficient producing oil, refining oil locally and exporting? Dangote: Well, if the NNPC put all their refineries to work, Nigeria will be the largest petroleum products export country in the continent. Not only in the continent - it\u2019ll be one of the biggest (worldwide), not as much as India but almost. So let me talk about Dangote Refinery: 40% of our refining products will go outside Nigeria. So that is after meeting the entire demand of Nigeria. We will meet the demand 100%. By June or so, we should be able to fully meet Nigeria\u2019s demand and then because we\u2019re ramping up already, we\u2019re a little bit over 420,000 barrels per day already. So, as we go along, ramping up, I believe by July/August we should be at almost 550,000 barrels per day. Then maybe before end of the year we\u2019ll be at about 650,000. CNN: In addition to building the oil refinery, you also built a cement manufacturing plant and have become one of the largest cement producers in sub-Saharan Africa. Did it make economic sense at the time to build a cement plant and compete effectively with imported cement prices? Dangote: We didn\u2019t have much challenge because we were also the importers and there was massive demand in terms of cement. So, what we did was actually to continue with the trading by building capacity. When we started, our first plant was 5 million metric tons, and at that time, the entire production in Nigeria was 2.1 million metric tons. But we went ahead very aggressively \u2013 we invested our money, we risked our capital, and we made the country self-sufficient. CNN: I\u2019ve heard you talk a lot about the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) and whether it\u2019s viable. You have experience doing cross-border trade and even you\u2019ve got issues getting your cement across borders in certain parts of the continent, so what\u2019s happening? Dangote: The AfCFTA will be very, very beneficial and if you\u2019re thinking about benefit, our company will almost be one of the top five in terms of benefiting from the free trade agreement. But I have not seen any improvement [yet]. That\u2019s the truth because we have 3 million tons of urea [a type of fertilizer] to export to African countries. It\u2019s too much for Nigeria\u2019s consumption. We have petroleum projects to export. We have cement also to export. So what makes sense is to have the free trade agreement work. For us to cross that hurdle \u2013 because the trade between us [African countries] is only about 16%, which is too low \u2013 we have to make sure that all the regional markets work. We have to remove requirements of visas. We have to allow free movement of people, free movement of goods and services, then the AfCFTA will work \u2013 without that it\u2019s almost impossible. I mean, you look at it today, I\u2019m going to Egypt tomorrow, but I need a visa. They\u2019re saying that yes, okay, fine, they\u2019ll give me visa on arrival if I have an American [passport]. I have an African passport, so they\u2019re discounting me being an African. So how do we trade if you are not allowing me into your own country? CNN: So how are imports affecting industrialization and local growth of value chains? Dangote: Well, it will actually destroy the industrialization of Africa, if we continue to import. The more you import, you are importing poverty into your continent and exporting jobs. Because wherever you are importing from, you are encouraging them to keep expanding. When they expand, they recruit more people, give more jobs to their people. But here, the little jobs that we need to create, they destroy that. So, I\u2019m not a big fan of imports. I\u2019m a big fan of industrialization and Africa can be industrialized, but we, Africans, are the only ones that can industrialize Africa. Nobody is going to come and do it for us. We have to have good policies and the policies have to be consistent, and then we have to make sure that the investment climate is good.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/africa/aliko-dangote-oil-refinery-nigeria-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "world"}}

There\u2019s the Art Deco curved crown of the Chrysler Building, the sweeping isosceles triangles that twist around One World Trade Center, the stepped limestone and granite rectangles of the Empire State Building and the triangular prism of the Flatiron Building. And now, a multi-billion-dollar tower featuring floor-to-ceiling glass will add another dimension to the cityscape, according to new details unveiled by New York City Mayor Eric Adams this week. Stretching up 62 stories, a planned office tower at 350 Park Avenue will provide space for more than 6,000 jobs, plus 1.8 million square feet of commercial office space, according to a press release. It will be funded by Vornado Realty Trust, Kenneth Griffin, founder and CEO of global investment firm Citadel, and building and management company Rudin. White columns will frame a new public concourse at the base of the new building on Park Avenue, complete with green space, seating and art displays, images show. Above, landscaped terraces will top each section of the glass-clad tower which will house the offices for Citadel and market making firm Citadel Securities. Adams hailed the project in the release, saying it will help \u201csupercharge our economy and expand New York City\u2019s iconic skyline,\u201d building on \u201ccontinued efforts to energize Midtown Manhattan as the world\u2019s most important business address and an economic engine for working-class New Yorkers.\u201d Architects Foster + Partners have designed the building, which will replace the existing 30-story tower currently at the site in Midtown Manhattan just a few blocks away from landmarks like the Rockefeller Center, St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral and Grand Central Station. As New York continues to deal with the economic aftershocks wrought by the Covid-19 pandemic, Adams and his administration said in their respective statements that they hoped this project would continue the city\u2019s recovery. \u201cThis investment opens a new chapter for Midtown \u2014 and closes the book on those who predicted its demise,\u201d said deputy mayor for operations Meera Joshi. \u201cMidtown\u2019s revitalization is being led by its public realm \u2014 including investments in Fifth Avenue, with the crown jewels of Central Park and Bryant Park at either end. Together, with our business improvement district and parks partners, we are reintroducing Fifth Avenue to the world and creating a vibrant live, work, play community for a new era,\u201d Joshi added. Building this new office space comes at a fraught time for the commercial real estate market as businesses struggle to entice workers back to the office after years of working from home. This has left vast tranches of office space vacant or underused, causing the value of such buildings to plummet at the same time as historically high interest rates have made it harder for real estate developers \u2014\u00a0who often take out huge loans to finance projects \u2014\u00a0to make good on their repayments. The project will begin the city\u2019s public review process early next year and the tower is expected to be completed by 2032, according to the release.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/20/style/park-avenue-skyscraper-new-york-skyline-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "world"}}

The IDF claimed Tuesday afternoon local time that fighter jets were attacking Hamas targets in the Bureij area \u201cat the same time as ground forces that are operating in a targeted manner and with intelligence guidance,\u201d in the same area. CNN cannot independently verify the IDF\u2019s statement. The Ministry of Health in Gaza said that 15 people had been killed and dozens injured during the Israeli operation, with the casualties occurring east of the Bureij and Al-Maghazi displacement camps. It said the local Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital was overwhelmed with admissions. A CNN producer in the area said that at least six bodies had been brought to the hospital, along with more than 30 injured people. Among those killed were a father and his 12-year-old son, when an artillery shell hit an apartment building east of Al Bureij, according to the CNN producer, as well as a boy and a girl. A woman in her 20s was also killed. The ministry said the number of patients was more than three times the hospital\u2019s normal capacity and that it was unable to bear receiving more martyrs and injuries in light of this dangerous aggression against civilians, children and women.\u201d It called on the World Health Organization to visit the hospital. Witnesses say civilians started to leave the Bureij area \u2013 heading towards the coast \u2013 after military activity there intensified. Another CNN producer reported tank-fire in recent days from the east-west Netzarim corridor that the IDF has carved through central Gaza towards neighborhoods south of Gaza city. He said there had been a limited ground incursion in the same neighborhoods over the past three days. News of the latest assault comes as the former Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett told CNN the war with Hamas had lost momentum and that Israel should pressure Hamas by pushing on with its controversial operations in Gaza\u2019s southernmost city of Rafah. \u201cWe need to act much quicker. This whole war is going on way too long. We could\u2019ve done Rafah three, four months ago. I think a combination of poor execution of the Israeli government and the American administration\u2019s constant slowing down of Israel coupled together made for a very slow and prolonged war,\u201d Bennett told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper. He said that prolonging the war is what Hamas wants, and the only way to get a ceasefire and hostage deal on the table is to put more pressure on Hamas and push harder in Rafah, adding that operations there have not concluded. He said Israel is \u201cpaying an international price\u201d as other countries criticize the war\u2019s humanitarian toll. \u201cWe are trying to conduct the most just war in history,\u201d Bennett said, but \u201ceverybody in the world is double-guessing and telling us how to do it and how they would do it better, but they\u2019re not in our shoes, and we have to defend our citizens first.\u201d Israel launched its military offensive in Gaza on October 7 after the militant group Hamas, which governs Gaza, killed at least 1,200 people and abducted more than 250 others. Israeli attacks in Gaza have since killed at least\u00a036,550\u00a0Palestinians and injured another\u00a082,959\u00a0people, according to the Ministry of Health there. CNN cannot independently confirm the figures.

{"id": "2024_06_06_asia_north-korea-balloons-activists-kpop-intl-hnk", "text": "South Korean activists sent balloons carrying K-pop and K-dramas on USB sticks to their northern neighbor on Thursday, days after North Korean balloons of trash and \u201cfilth\u201d floated in the opposite direction. The activist group Fighters for a Free North Korea (FFNK) released the giant balloons in the early hours of Thursday morning, with videos showing them floating away, some dragging giant posters visible from afar while others carried smaller plastic packages. Inside the packages were 200,000 leaflets condemning North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, 5,000 USB sticks containing South Korean music videos and television shows, and 2,000 one dollar bills, according to FFNK. Groups such as FFNK have been sending these kinds of balloons for years, carrying items prohibited in the isolated totalitarian dictatorship \u2013 including food, medicine, radios, propaganda leaflets and pieces of South Korean news. In May, North Korea responded by sending its own giant balloons back south \u2013 containing trash, soil, pieces of paper and plastic, and what South Korean authorities described as \u201cfilth.\u201d Pyongyang claimed to have sent a total of 3,500 balloons carrying 15 tonnes of trash to its neighbor, according to state media KCNA, citing North Korea\u2019s Vice Defense Minister Kim Kang Il. Those balloons began landing in the South last week, temporarily disrupting flights and prompting authorities to warn residents to stay indoors. As of Monday, the South Korean military had found about 1,000 balloons. South Korean activists say they will continue to send the balloons north \u2013 even though doing so was banned by the government years ago. FFNK leader Park Sang-hak, a North Korean defector who fled to the South years ago, described the materials they sent as \u201cletters of truth and freedom.\u201d As a young man in North Korea, these balloons had offered him a rare glimpse into the outside world, he said. He recalled being in a public square in 1992 when \u201cI heard a huge balloon in the sky.\u201d \u201cThis round thing suddenly popped with a loud bang, then leaflets fell from the sky. I knew I wasn\u2019t supposed to look at those things, so I put one in my pocket and went to the bathroom to check it out,\u201d he said. The leaflet he pocketed contained stories about North Korean defectors and their escapes, some of whom had crossed into China before heading toward South Korea. Eight years later, Park fled the North \u2013 arriving in South Korea in 2000, and beginning his mission to send balloons across the border in 2006. The leaflets he sends carry information about the Kim family, including the assassination of the leader\u2019s half-brother Kim Jong Nam \u2014 as well as booklets about South Korea\u2019s economic and political development, including photos of the main Seoul airport and the country\u2019s fighter jets. \u201cSouth Korea is not an American colony or a wasteland of humanity like I learned in North Korea,\u201d he told CNN on Wednesday. \u201cWe sent money, medicine, facts, truth, and love, but to send filth and trash in return? That\u2019s an inhumane and barbaric act.\u201d Meanwhile, some South Korean residents living near the border are now on edge. \u201cI lived through the Korean War and other difficulties, and I was worried \u2026 What if we have another war?\u201d said 84-year-old Song Kwang-ja, a resident of Yongin city, on Thursday. \u201cThat reminded me of the old days. I still get goosebumps thinking and talking about it,\u201d she said, adding that the balloons \u201cfelt like a childish prank.\u201d The incident has also worsened strained relations between the two countries. South Korea announced this week it would resume \u201call military activities\u201d near the demarcation line \u2013 suspending a 2018 agreement signed by both nations at a brief time of relatively warm relations.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/asia/north-korea-balloons-activists-kpop-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "world"}}
