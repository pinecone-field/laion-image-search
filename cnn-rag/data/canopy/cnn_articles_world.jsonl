Announcing the positions on Tuesday, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said that conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Middle East had caused \u201ca great deal of grief\u201d for Jewish and Islamic communities in Australia. \u201cAustralians overwhelmingly do not want conflict brought here. What they want here is harmony and for people to be able to get on with each other,\u201d he said. The appointments come amid protests in Australia and dissent within the ranks of Albanese\u2019s ruling Labor Party over a war that has cost tens of thousands of lives and displaced more than 2 million people in Gaza. More than 38,000 Palestinians have been killed since October 7, when Israel launched a devastating response to an attack by Hamas militants that killed more than 1,100 Israelis and saw hundreds of others kidnapped\u00a0to Gaza. The two sides remain locked in conflict amid deeply polarized protests around the world over how Israel is fighting the conflict in Gaza where millions of Palestinians are facing famine and Hamas continues to hold hostages. Albanese said Tuesday that Jewish lawyer Jillian Segal had been appointed to consult Jewish Australians, experts and the wider community about ways to best address antisemitism. \u201cOne of the things that I have found quite shocking is the lack of knowledge and experience about antisemitism and about where it leads,\u201d Albanese said from the Jewish Museum in Sydney where he made the announcement. \u201cI have spoken with members of the Jewish community here, in Melbourne, right around Australia, who have not felt safe, members of the Jewish community whose children are worried about wearing their school uniform in our capital cities. That\u2019s not acceptable,\u201d he said. The Executive Council of Australian Jewry (ECAJ), which represents the Jewish community, recorded a spike in antisemitic incidents from October to November 2023. The group said Tuesday reports of antisemitic incidents in Australia are still running 400-500% higher than before the conflict. In some of the most high-profile incidents in Melbourne this year, windows were smashed on the office of a Jewish lawmaker and antisemitic slogans were written on a Jewish school. The Australian government supports a two-state solution to the conflict in the Middle East and has backed calls for a ceasefire, the safe passage of humanitarian aid, and the release of dozens of Israeli hostages held by Hamas. Albanese said\u00a0a \u201cspecial envoy for Islamophobia\u201d\u00a0will be appointed \u201cshortly\u201d in a similar role to work with the Muslim community to promote social cohesion. Most countries recognize Palestinian statehood, and in May a United Nations resolution on Palestinian membership passed with the support of 143 nations, including Australia. In recent weeks the government\u2019s own cohesion has been tested by the resignation of a West Australian senator, who crossed the floor to vote with a rival party on the issue of Palestinian statehood. \u201cWith a heavy heart but a clear conscience, I announce my resignation from the Australian Labor Party,\u201d Sen. Fatima Payman announced last Thursday. Payman, Labor\u2019s first Muslim senator, voted\u00a0with the Greens Party on a motion to recognize Palestinian statehood and threatened to do it again, breaking party rules. She was indefinitely suspended from Labor\u2019s parliamentary caucus and later resigned to serve as an independent, accusing her former colleagues of attempting to intimidate her \u2013 claims the party denied. Protests against Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza are continuing in Australia with four people arrested for climbing onto the roof of Parliament House last week. University protests that saw hundreds of students pitch tents on campus grounds around Australia have since ended, with threats of expulsion for some students who took part.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/australia/australia-envoys-antisemitism-islamophobia-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_10_asia_japan-rina-gonoi-sexual-assault-settlement-intl-hnk", "text": "A former soldier who was sexually assaulted while serving in Japan\u2019s military has reached a civil settlement with three of her convicted attackers in a case that exposed a widespread culture of harassment in the country\u2019s self-defense force. The settlement, initiated by the three former soldiers who were found guilty of sexual assault by a Japanese court in December, includes them apologizing and paying a sum of money, Rina Gonoi said on her X account on Tuesday. She did not disclose the amount of money involved. \u201cToday, I would like to announce that a settlement has been reached in the civil trial with the three perpetrators who were found guilty in the criminal trial,\u201d Gonoi said. Gonoi pursued both criminal and civil cases in the courts, including the civil lawsuit in which she is seeking compensation from the government and five former members of the Japan Self-Defense Force (JSDF) for emotional stress caused by sexual abuse, public broadcaster NHK reported. \u201cI am relieved that the three years of fighting came to an end and I\u2019m feeling three years\u2019 worth of exhaustion all at once, but I will take care not to get sick,\u201d Gonoi said on her Instagram account on Tuesday night. She had previously reached a settlement with another of the five former members of the JSDF in the civil case, and the trial will continue against the government and the remaining former members, NHK reported. Yoshiaki Saito, a lawyer representing the three soldiers, told CNN on Wednesday that they had no comment. CNN has also reached out to Japan\u2019s Ministry of Defense and the JSDF for comment. Gonoi said she endured physical and verbal sexual abuse on a daily basis for more than a year while serving in the JSDF, and vowed to bring her tormentors to justice when she left the military in June 2022. Authorities initially seemed unwilling to believe her but Gonoi\u2019s refusal to be silenced eventually prompted prosecutors to reopen investigations in a sweeping probe into sexual harassment across the JSDF. \u201cI wanted to help other people who had also been sexually harassed (in the JSDF). As for the perpetrators, I wanted an apology and for them to admit to what they had done; I wanted to prevent others from going through what I went through; that\u2019s why I spoke out,\u201d Gonoi told CNN last July. The broad investigation led by Japan\u2019s defense ministry found that Gonoi had suffered physical and verbal sexual harassment daily between late 2020 and August 2021. Japan\u2019s struggles with gender inequality, which were highlighted during the #MeToo campaign, are well documented. The country ranks bottom of all G7 nations and 125th out of 146 countries in the World Economic Forum\u2019s index for gender inequality. Not backing down As a child, Gonoi said she saw JSDF members as heroes. She grew up wanting to be like them after women officers in particular came to her rescue following the deadly 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami that decimated her hometown of Higashi-Matsushima in Japan\u2019s northern prefecture of Miyagi. Years later, it would be a posting to a JSDF station in Fukushima \u2013 another area that was decimated by the 2011 disaster \u2013 where she told CNN she first experienced sexual harassment. \u201cThey\u2019d comment on my body and the size of my breasts. Or they\u2019d come up to me in the hallways and suddenly hug me in the corridor. That kind of thing happened daily,\u201d Gonoi recalled of her time in the station. The last straw came in August 2021, when Gonoi said she was pinned to a dormitory floor as several senior male officers simulated sexual intercourse. It was this incident that convinced her to report her assailants. When she reported the alleged abuse to military authorities, two investigations were launched, but both were dropped on grounds of a lack of evidence \u2013 prompting her to take the battle to social media. Going public was a rare move in a country where sexual assault survivors can face backlash for raising their voices. But it paid off, as the social media scrutiny pressured the JSDF into a rethink. The defense ministry eventually launched a broad investigation into sexual harassment across the JSDF that found Gonoi had suffered physical and verbal sexual harassment daily between late 2020 and August 2021. The case reached the highest levels, with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida saying during a parliamentary meeting in October 2022 that he understood sexual harassment cases were handled inappropriately by the JSDF and the ministry. Last December, a Japanese court ruled that the three men had committed forcible indecency against Gonoi. The court sentenced the trio to two years in prison with a suspended sentence, NHK reported, which could allow them to avoid jail time if they do not commit a crime over a two-year period. The landmark decision was an encouraging sign but \u201cthe country still has a long way to go to change both the criminal justice system and the culture of victim-blaming that undermines the credibility of survivors,\u201d according to Amnesty International\u2019s East Asia researcher Boram Jang. \u201cRina Gonoi dared to speak out to break the cycle of impunity for gender-based violence in Japan. This is a rare victory not just for her, but for all victims and survivors of sexual assault in Japan, many of whom suffer in silence,\u201d Jang said in a statement after the ruling.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/10/asia/japan-rina-gonoi-sexual-assault-settlement-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_03_tech_elevenlabs-ai-celebrity-voices", "text": "Actress Judy Garland never recorded her voice to read an audiobook of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, but you\u2019ll soon be able to hear her rendition of the children\u2019s novel that inspired the movie nonetheless. Earlier this week, AI company ElevenLabs said it is bringing digitally produced celebrity voice-overs of deceased actors, including Garland, James Dean and Burt Reynolds, to its newly launched Reader app. The company said the app takes articles, PDF, ePub, newsletters, e-books or any other text on your phone and turns it into voice-overs.  \u201cWe deeply respect their legacy and are honored to have their voices as part of our platform,\u201d said Dustin Blank, head of partnerships at ElevenLabs. \u201cAdding them to our growing list of narrators marks a major step forward in our mission of making content accessible in any language and voice.\u201d The company said it made deals with the estates of the actors whose voices are being used, but did not share details about compensation. The effort shows the potential of artificial intelligence for Hollywood but also sets a precedent for licensing and working with estates. It also comes at a time when the technology has grown by leaps and bounds, particularly in its ability to create images, text and sound, making it easy for anyone to create a version of someone\u2019s voice saying something they never did. That, in turn, has raised questions in creative industries such as journalism and film about how artificial intelligence can \u2014 or even should \u2014 be used. ElevenLabs previously made headlines earlier this year when its tool was reportedly used to create a fake robocall from President Joe Biden urging people not to vote in New Hampshire\u2019s presidential primary. Copyright questions and authenticity The partnership with the stars\u2019 estates comes two months after ChatGPT-maker OpenAI came under fire after introducing a synthetic voice that was eerily similar to Scarlett Johansson\u2019s character in the film \u201cHer.\u201d Johansson said in a statement shared with CNN that she was \u201cshocked, angered and in disbelief\u201d that the company would use her likeliness likeness after she turned down a partnership opportunity with OpenAI. Although a person can\u2019t copyright their own voice, it\u2019s possible to copyright a recording, according to David Gunkel, a professor at the department of communications at Northern Illinois University who tracks AI in media and entertainment. The AI is trained on old recordings and those recordings are under copyright. \u201cElevenLabs\u2019 new partnerships are all well within the realm of what the law allows,\u201d he said. \u201cAn estate will get a considerable amount of money from licensing and agreements. It\u2019s not unlike a company negotiating a copyright deal to use a popular song by Queen in an ad. The record company also could in theory say no, no matter how much money they\u2019re offered.\u201d Bern Elliot, a vice president and analyst at market research firm Gartner, said AI models can now be trained on fewer audio recordings; very little is needed to capture tone, speech patterns and other elements, whether it\u2019s for a celebrity or an everyday person. \u201cThe bigger concern is determining what the owner of those recordings can or can\u2019t do to monetize the voice,\u201d he said. Media companies are also ramping up their use of AI for voiceovers. Last week, NBC announced it is bringing an AI-version version of famed sportscaster Al Michaels back to the Olympics this summer, in daily recaps on its Peacock streaming platform. An NBC spokesperson told CNN that Michaels is being compensated for his involvement. It\u2019s unclear, however, how AI versions of well-known voices will be received by mass audiences and if it will raise concerns around authenticity. \u201cWe don\u2019t know yet the supposed market for these types of things but you can already see with audiobooks that ones read by recognizable voices and celebrities are a hot commodity,\u201d Gunkel said. \u201cIf there\u2019s a way to have a celebrity do all kinds of content and not voice it themselves, that could open up the market even wider.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/tech/elevenlabs-ai-celebrity-voices/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_10_india_russia-indian-nationals-fighting-ukraine-intl-hnk", "text": "Russia has promised to discharge Indian nationals who were \u201cmisled\u201d into joining its army to fight in Ukraine, India\u2019s foreign secretary said Tuesday. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi \u201cstrongly raised the issue of early discharge\u201d to Russian President Vladimir Putin during his two-day trip to Moscow this week, stressing the need to bring all Indians home \u201cas early as possible,\u201d Foreign Secretary Vinay Mohan Kwatra told reporters in a news briefing. \u201cThe Russian side promised the early discharge of all Indian nationals from the service of the Russian army,\u201d he said. Moscow has not commented on the agreement, but New Delhi has been pushing for the release of its nationals from the Russian army for months, telling CNN in April that it was a \u201ctop priority.\u201d\u00a0The Indian Ministry of External Affairs\u00a0previously told CNN it has been in continuous contact with Russian authorities to secure their release. By some estimates, Russia has been sending thousands of foreign men to fight in Ukraine since Putin ordered the full-scale invasion of its southwestern neighbor in February 2022. Many of them are young men from South Asia, enticed by the prospect of steady employment and higher salaries in Russia. In Nepal, prominent opposition lawmaker and former foreign minister Bimala Rai Paudyal told parliament earlier this year that between\u00a014,000 and 15,000 Nepalis were fighting on the front lines, citing testimony from men returning from Ukraine. The Russian government last year announced a lucrative package for foreign fighters to join the country\u2019s military, including a monthly salary of at least $2,000 and a fast track to Russian citizenship \u2013 but the Kremlin has not said how many foreigners it has recruited under the plan. In early March, India\u2019s Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) said it had busted major human trafficking networks that were duping men into Russian military jobs, with 35 such cases identified. \u201cThe trafficked Indian Nationals were trained in combat roles and deployed at front bases in Russia-Ukraine War Zone against their wishes,\u201d the CBI statement said. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Kwatra said he does know the precise number of Indians recruited to fight for Russia in Ukraine, but anticipates it is between 35 and 50 people. Of those, 10 Indian nationals have already returned to India, he said. \u201cNow, the two sides will work on it and see how expeditiously we can get them back into the country,\u201d Kwatra said. India has no law preventing its citizens from serving in a foreign state\u2019s military. One family from the southern Indian city of Hyderabad recently told CNN they spent two months trying to find out what happened to their brother after he traveled to Russia on the promise of job opportunities. Imran\u00a0Mohammad said an employment agency had enticed his brother Asfan Mohammed with an offer for helper and security jobs in the Russian army, saying he could get a Russian passport and national card within a year. Instead, Asfan was sent to the battlefield in Ukraine and was killed in combat. \u201cThese brokers duped the boys and put their lives in danger,\u201d Imran said, referring to Asfan and other Indians sent to war. In neighboring Nepal, lawmakers have called on the Russian authorities to provide figures for its nationals fighting in Ukraine. Several returned Nepali fighters who spoke with CNN earlier this year blamed Russia for using them as cannon fodder in the war. \u201cIt\u2019s the Nepalis and other foreign fighters that are actually fighting in the front of war zones. The Russians position themselves a few hundred meters back as support,\u201d said Suman Tamang, after he returned from Russia. The Nepalis who fought for Russia said they had received only brief training before being sent into combat. Ramchandra Khadka, who returned to Nepal after suffering injuries in Ukraine, told CNN that after only two weeks of training, he was sent to the front lines in Bakhmut \u2013 a town in eastern Ukraine that saw some of the heaviest fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces \u2013 with a gun and a basic kit. \u201cI didn\u2019t join the Russian military for pleasure. I didn\u2019t have any job opportunities in Nepal. But in hindsight, it wasn\u2019t the right decision,\u201d Khadka said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t realize we would be sent to the front lines that quickly and how horrible the situation would be.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/10/india/russia-indian-nationals-fighting-ukraine-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_09_europe_how-macron-lost-france-intl-cmd", "text": "It feels like a lifetime ago. Emmanuel Macron marched on to the stage in 2017, a boyish spring in his step and a breathless excitement in his victory speech: The grand entrance to his presidency. He\u00a0promised\u00a0to be France\u2019s centrist hope after decades of division, the great reformer who would jolt France to the forefront of global business.\u00a0He\u2019s now staring at what will certainly be his real legacy: Macron opened the door to the far right in France. After a shattering defeat in May\u2019s European Parliament election, his decision to call a snap election has, at least partially, backfired. In a surprise result, the New Popular Front (NFP), a cluster of left-wing parties, won 182 seats in the National Assembly, short of a majority but ahead of both Macron\u2019s centrist bloc and the far right. The far-right bloc was widely expected to come first, but a country-wide effort to hold it back, with both leftists and centrist candidates standing down to concentrate the anti-far-right vote, succeeded. A relief for Macron, who should be saved from forced cooperation with a far-right prime minister. But the political chaos of a hung parliament awaits: A far-cry from the landslide he won in 2017. Bold is how many distilled his rocketing ascent into the French presidency; arrogant is how many now view his Icarus-like fall from grace. Macron demolished the architecture of French politics in his meteoric rise to the Elysee Palace. Carving out a new, centrist party from the political right and left, his landslide victory in 2017 \u2013 after just a short stint as a government minister - set him up to suffocate the political landscape, trying to satisfy anti-immigrant border policies with fiscally loose environmental and social protections. With Macron dominating the middle ground, political oxygen was sucked to the extremes. That\u2019s seen a polarization of policy proposals \u2013 from neutering France\u2019s sacrosanct secularism on the left to hounding out \u201cIslamist ideologies\u201d on the right \u2013 and a deepening, painful division in French society. His political star has burnt bright but is already collapsing on itself. This is an end of his own making. Love or hate relationship Never afraid to chart a difficult course, early in his presidency he plowed into his project of reform: slashing taxes for the rich and hiking diesel prices. The proposals were typically Macronian: Fiscally sound, business-minded and poorly marketed. The public reaction too\u00a0became\u00a0classic for Macron: Fiery outrage on the streets of France. The diesel tax sparked the worst protests France \u2013 perhaps the spiritual home of street anger \u2013 had seen in decades. The\u00a0\u201cyellow vest\u201d movement swept the country\u00a0in 2018, bringing hundreds of thousands of everyday French people on to the streets, braving harsh policing and succeeding in holding the country\u2019s political agenda hostage. \u201cI think that no country moves forward if it does not also hear this part of the legitimate anger of our people,\u201d he said, a couple of months after protests began. \u201cI think that they\u2019re reconcilable and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing.\u201d It took the longest street protest in 50 years, but Macron eventually\u00a0did\u00a0listen to the anger of the yellow vests, or gilets jaunes. For a former banker-turned-economy minister, with little relatable experience of everyday France, his solution was a bold stroke of PR: A nationwide tour of town halls, a chance to hear and be heard. A man never far from accusations of being an ivory-tower politician\u00a0offered a humble face. Political stormtrooper Then came Covid-19. Macron deployed the all-or-nothing approach he favored, with one of the strictest lockdown regimes in Europe, in repeated waves, and a rigid vaccination protocol. \u201cWe are at war,\u201d he told the nation in March 2020. \u201cDay and night, nothing must distract us from it.\u201d He embraced a similar philosophy post-pandemic, as the global economy struggled to rebound and tensions over Ukraine threatened to throttle economic growth. Macron spent big, shielding French businesses and consumers from the worst of energy prices hikes, just months after massive post-Covid spending. By 2024, France was running one of the highest deficits in the Eurozone but the former economy minister had got what he paid for. French growth is\u00a0projected to be 0.7%\u00a0in 2024, and gain momentum next year, showing\u00a0striking resilience\u00a0since the pandemic. Inflation is\u00a0also\u00a0set to\u00a0fall significantly. Macron and his supporters point to his economic record as reason enough to vote for him.\u00a0But\u00a0the French are rarely so generous with their sitting presidents \u2013 gratitude is in short supply. Today, Macron\u2019s approval ratings\u00a0sit at 30%, down from nearly 50% when he stepped into office but his disapproval ratings (now at 65%) have not dropped below 50% since his first months in office, according to Ipsos-Le Point polling. The French love to hate their politicians and Macron is no different. The country\u2019s two-term\u00a0constitutional\u00a0limit means Macron can\u2019t run again for president in 2027. One lawmaker from Macron\u2019s party said that the public disappointment in the French president stemmed from how publicly invested he had been in the country\u2019s direction, making it clear that his four prime ministers were strictly following his lead. \u201cHe was ultimately very active in his two five-year terms, unlike other presidents who took a back seat and let their prime minister take the hits,\u201d the member of parliament said, requesting anonymity to speak frankly. \u201cWe felt (the PMs) were very dependent on him,\u201d they added. Under pressure at home,\u00a0he\u2019s enjoyed playing the statesman, whether rallying forces behind the European project or going head to head with combative counterparts, be they Putin or Trump. He was a crusader for European military and industrial sovereignty from American patronage long before the war in Ukraine made them fashionable. And he has been a critical ally to Kyiv in the face of Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion, leading the charge with supplies of light tanks, then long-range missiles and French-made fighter jets, while keeping European allies in lockstep with Ukraine. In the invasion\u2019s early days, critics slammed him for his efforts with Putin \u2013 later revealed to be at Kyiv\u2019s request. But later, he looked to outmanoeuvre Putin with force, raising the issue of NATO-member troop deployments and cementing the West\u2019s unwavering support for Ukraine. Unheeded warnings? With the (arguably haughty) self-assuredness that has come to define his image,  Macron issued warnings time and again over the menace of the far-right. \u201cI don\u2019t want to belong to a generation of sleepwalkers, I don\u2019t want to belong to a generation that\u2019s forgotten its own past or that refuses to see the torments of its own present,\u201d he told the European Parliament in 2018. Finally, after years of inching far-right advances, the 2024 European Parliament elections saw his centrist politics submerged by a call from the far\u00a0right. As Marine Le Pen and her lieutenant Jordan Bardella of National Rally hammer home, too many French voters \u2013 struggling with economic pressures and anti-immigration narratives - felt ignored or unheard, those that in his own inauguration speech Macron had called the \u201cFrench men and French women who feel forgotten by this vast global movement.\u201d Unheard and ignored was how many working French citizens felt in 2023, as anger at a hike in the retirement age sparked months of protests. It was a gordian knot of Macron\u2019s own making. Solving pensions\u2019\u00a0fatal funding dilemma was sound policy on paper but woefully sold to the public. It was finally driven into law without lawmakers\u2019 consent: The government ruling by decree. Stripped of his parliamentary majority in 2022 and stung by a rejection of his vision at the 2024 European elections, he gambled on his faith in the French electorate. \u201cIt is above all, an act of trust,\u201d Macron said as he called snap parliamentary elections, \u201cin the capacity of the French people to make the most just decision.\u201d Many in France wondered why.\u00a0Among MPs of Macron\u2019s party, there was \u201clots of incomprehension,\u201d the lawmaker told CNN. Struggling with unfavorable parliamentary arithmetic, \u201cit was going to happen in any case,\u201d the MP said. \u201cI think what made it harder for me compared to the others is that the person who pressed the button is the president, so obviously it\u2019s him who is at fault.\u201d The result was\u00a0effectively\u00a0a referendum on Macron himself.\u00a0His centrist Ensemble alliance now holds 163 seats, far fewer than the 245 seats it took in 2022, and he presents a weakened figure abroad and at home. The far right argue they pose no threat to France. \u201cWe don\u2019t represent any danger, apart from making (Macron) lose power,\u201d Marine Le Pen told CNN last week. But there is a real fear of a return to power of identity politics in many parts of today\u2019s culturally rich, but complicated, France. Now that the far right have stormed to legislative power \u2013 and have their sights set on the Elysee Palace in 2027\u00a0\u2013 the threat posed by the National Rally\u2019s victories is not limited to Macron\u2019s ego. For countless communities in France - French or\u00a0immigrant\u00a0- the legacy of one man\u2019s gamble, and the uncertainty that is his legacy, will exact a far higher price.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/europe/how-macron-lost-france-intl-cmd/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_07_08_europe_china-belarus-military-exercises-poland-intl", "text": "Belarus and China kicked off 11-day joint military training exercises Monday, Belarus\u2019 defense ministry said \u2013 with activities taking place just miles from the border of Poland, a NATO and European Union member. The joint anti-terrorist training \u201cAttacking Falcon\u201d exercises in Belarus would see military personnel from both countries \u201cact together\u201d as one unit in certain stages, Maj. Gen. Vadim Denisenko of the Belarusian military said in a Telegram post. \u201cEvents in the world are complex, the situation is complex, therefore, having studied new forms and methods of conducting warfare, here we will work out all these moments considering all that is new that has been learnt in the past two years,\u201d Denisenko said. The joint exercises are being held at a training ground\u00a0near the\u00a0city of Brest on the\u00a0Belarus-Poland border and some 40 miles from Belarus\u2019 border with Ukraine. They come as Russia\u2019s invasion of that country more than two years ago has hardened geopolitical divisions and continues to threaten broader regional security. Beijing and Minsk have tightened their ties in recent years under Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, both autocrats and strong allies of Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin. The start of the anti-terrorism exercises coincided with a visit by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to Warsaw, where he signed a security agreement with Polish Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk. They also began on the eve of NATO\u2019s 75th\u00a0anniversary\u00a0summit in Washington \u2013 a gathering where leaders will look to shore up support for Ukraine. NATO and the EU have long accused Belarus of weaponizing the border by pushing asylum-seekers from third countries to its\u00a0borders, and the joint exercises will no doubt be seen by some as a further provocation. CNN has reached out to NATO for comment. Belarus has been a critical Russian ally in the Kremlin\u2019s war on Ukraine. Moscow partly used Belarus as a launching pad for the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 after amassing troops on the Ukrainian border during what it said were joint military exercises. Last year Putin also announced Russia would place tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus. China has emerged as a key diplomatic and economic lifeline for Russia since its invasion of Ukraine, and been accused by Western leaders of bolstering Moscow\u2019s war effort through the provision of dual use goods \u2013 a charge Beijing denies. Belarus\u2019 Ministry of Defense said troops from China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army arrived in\u00a0Belarus\u00a0over the weekend. It published a series of photographs showing Chinese troops offloading equipment from a military cargo aircraft and said the drills will last until July 19. China\u2019s Ministry of Defense said on Sunday that the drills would include \u201chostage rescue operations and counter-terrorism missions.\u201d \u201cThe training aims to enhance the training levels and coordination capabilities of the participating troops, as well as deepen practical cooperation between the armies of the two countries,\u201d it added. Over the weekend, a delegations from China\u2019s Central Military Commission also held talks with counterparts in Minsk where the two sides discussed \u201cprospects for Belarusian-Chinese cooperation on military personnel training\u201d and outlined new areas of cooperation, according to Belarus\u2019 defense ministry. This latest showing of their security cooperation comes\u00a0just days after Belarus joined the Beijing- and Moscow-backed Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) on Thursday. Founded in 2001 by China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan to combat terrorism and promote border security, the SCO has grown in recent years as Beijing and Moscow drive a transformation of the bloc from a regional security club with a focus on Central Asia to a geopolitical counterweight to Western institutions led by the United States and its allies. Belarus\u2019 entry in the bloc \u2013 hailed by Xi and Lukashenko in a meeting on the sidelines of an SCO summit in Kazakhstan last week \u2013 was widely seen by observers as another mark of that transformation. Then, Xi hailed the \u201cgreat strides\u201d in the relationship between the two countries \u2013\u00a0a sentiment echoed in a meeting between Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and his newly appointed Belarusian counterpart Maksim Ryzhenkov on Monday in Beijing. Wang and Ryzhenkov agreed that the two sides would \u201cfirmly support each other\u201d on issues concerning their core interests and major concerns, according to a readout from China\u2019s Foreign Ministry, which also noted their ambition to \u201creject unilateral hegemony\u201d \u2013 a reference to their shared opposition to a world order they see as dominated by the United States.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/europe/china-belarus-military-exercises-poland-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "world"}}

The Netherlands took an early lead thanks to Xavi Simons\u2019 long-range rocket, but England hit back almost immediately as captain Harry Kane levelled the scores from the penalty spot. Chances were few and far between in the second half and it took until the first minute of added time for England to find the winner, with substitute Watkins stunning the Dutch. It\u2019s the first time in history that England has reached a major final on foreign soil and the team \u2013 as well as manager Gareth Southgate \u2013 now has the chance to atone for that heart-breaking defeat in the final to Italy three years ago. Awaiting England in Sunday\u2019s final is the formidable foe of Spain, which has been unequivocally the best team of Euro 2024 so far. Match-winner Watkins said he has been \u201cwaiting for weeks\u201d for that moment, with his goal set up by Cole Palmer, who was another English subsitute. \u201cI swear on my life, my kid\u2019s life, I said to Cole Palmer: \u2018We\u2019re coming on today and you\u2019re going to set me up.\u2019 That\u2019s why I was so happy with Coley. I knew as soon as he got the ball, he was going to play me. \u201cWhen I saw it go in the bottom corner, it was the best feeling ever. There\u2019s been a lot of criticism and at the end of the day we\u2019re in the final and that\u2019s all that matters. Forget all the outside noise, we\u2019re in the final. \u201cWe\u2019ve got that bounce back factor, going a goal behind. We never give up. We\u2019ve won on penalties, come from behind. One more game, one more game,\u201d added Watkins, referring to Sunday\u2019s final Three Lions roar again England, like many of the so-called bigger nations, has struggled to find any sort of form at Euro 2024. Despite a vast array of talented attacking players \u2013 some among the best in the world \u2013 for many England fans watching Gareth Southgate\u2019s side has frequently made for tough viewing. The team \u2013 which only finished top of a weak group by the skin of its teeth - has been described as negative and defensive, the passing telegraphed and the movement plodding. England reached the semifinal thanks to moments of individual brilliance, first Jude Bellingham and then Bukayo Saka bailing the Three Lions out in their two previous knockout games at the tournament. The Netherlands has similarly struggled in Germany and only reached the knockout stages as one of the four best third-placed teams, while they needed to come from behind to beat Turkey in the quarterfinals. Nevertheless, tournament football is about one thing only: lifting the trophy. Fans of both nations would forgive any number of dull performances if their team brings home the Henri Delaunay Cup on Sunday. Immediately, though, this semifinal in Dortmund was more riveting than any game either of the two teams had played at Euro 2024. After only seven minutes, Simons \u2013 named after Barcelona great Xavi Hern\u00e1ndez \u2013 dispossessed Declan Rice in midfield and stormed towards the England penalty area, before unleashing an unstoppable shot past Jordan Pickford and into the top corner. Now England had no choice but to attack \u2013 something that hasn\u2019t come easy for Southgate\u2019s side in Germany \u2013 and found the equalizer just 10 minutes later. After Kane\u2019s acrobatic effort flew over the crossbar, replays showed Denzel Dumfries\u2019 studs caught Kane on the top of his foot and, after an intervention from VAR, referee Felix Zwayer pointed to the spot. Kane, who missed a crucial penalty for England against France in the quarterfinals of the Qatar World Cup in 2022, confidently drilled his penalty low into the bottom corner. Dumfries then saved the Netherlands from going behind as he was in the right place and the right to deny Phil Foden\u2019s effort on the line, before thumping a header off the crossbar at the other end. Foden, who was having by far his best game of the tournament, then hit the woodwork himself as the post denied the Manchester City forward a stunning curled effort. England was no doubt the dominant team in a riveting first half, which raised the question: Where has this kind of performance been all tournament? Passes were being drilled into feet with purpose, runs were incisive, and players were looking to shoot at every opportunity. If there\u2019s a time to find some form, it\u2019s in the semifinal of a major international competition and England fans will have gone into half-time feeling optimistic about their team\u2019s chances in the second half. But Ronald Koeman tightened up his midfield at the start of the second period, limiting the space England had enjoyed and exploited so successfully in the first half. England passes were once again mostly backwards and sideways in front of a comfortable Netherlands defense as Southgate and his players looked short of ideas. Fortunately for England, the Netherlands were also not posing much of a threat and neither goalkeeper had very much to do - until Watkins broke Dutch hearts. The Aston Villa striker received the pass from Palmer with his back to goal and Stefan de Vrij in close attendance, but created just enough space to drill a brilliant effort across goal and into the bottom corner. England has known little more than disappointment and heartbreak since winning the World Cup in 1966, Southgate more than most. Now the team has another chance to end 58 years of hurt.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/10/sport/england-netherlands-euro-2024-semifinals-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "world"}}

Israeli forces targeted the gate of a school housing displaced people in the town of Abasan, east of Khan Younis, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza, which called the attack \u201ca heinous massacre against displaced citizens.\u201d The strike injured another 53 people, the ministry added, including some who are in a \u201cserious and critical\u201d condition. The death toll is expected to increase, as casualties are still being transferred to the nearby Nasser Hospital. The Israeli military said it conducted a strike \u201cnear\u201d Al-Awda school on Tuesday, and that it had targeted \u201ca terrorist\u201d who participated in the October 7 attacks into southern Israel. \u201cEarlier this evening, using precise munition, the IAF struck a terrorist from Hamas\u2019 military wing\u00a0who took part, among other terrorist activities, in the October 7 brutal massacre carried out by the Hamas terrorist organization in southern Israel,\u201d the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement. \u201cThe IDF is looking into the reports that civilians were harmed, adjacent to the Al-Awda School\u00a0in the south of Khan Younis, which is located near the location of the strike. The incident is\u00a0under\u00a0review,\u201d the IDF added. CNN cannot verify the IDF\u2019s statements. Hamas also condemned it in a statement, saying the strike on the school represents \u201ca continuation of the genocidal war and horrific massacres against our defenseless people.\u201d Hamas called for people around the world to \u201cimmediately take to the streets and squares in massive demonstrations and rallies\u201d in support of people in Gaza, as well as called for people in the West Bank to support Gaza and clash with Israeli forces. Israel launched its military offensive in Gaza on October 7 after the militant group Hamas, which governs Gaza, killed at least 1,200 people and abducted more than 250 others. Israeli attacks in Gaza have since killed 38,295 Palestinians and injured another 88,241 people, according to the Ministry of Health there. \u2018Why don\u2019t we have the right to live?\u2019 CNN footage from the aftermath of the attack shows bewildered Palestinian children clambering over slabs of broken concrete, with old clothes strewn across blown-out buildings. One survivor told CNN she and other Palestinians were tucked into a local marketplace when \u201ca missile landed on us.\u201d \u201cWe are dying here\u2026 We saw the scene of 30 martyrs piled on top of each other,\u201d said Umm Mahmoud. \u201cOur hearts break with sadness\u2026 They (Israeli forces) want to terrorize us.\u201d Elsewhere, in Nasser Hospital, relatives of the deceased could be seen wailing in horror, their cheeks red and flushed, in CNN video. One woman, whose nephews Ahmad and Omar were killed in the attack, said she had been displaced for nine months. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we have the right to live? Why do our young people die like this?\u201d the aunt told CNN. \u201cWe have been here homeless for nine months and no one cares about us\u2026 We want to live in peace.\u201d Another Palestinian, Jadallah Abu Jamee, said her nine-year-old granddaughter, Rimas Abu Jamee, and cousin were killed in the strike. She told CNN that her daughter, a university student, was in surgery for an amputated hand and a head injury. \u201cA nine-year-old girl, what did she do to deserve this?\u201d said Jamee. The Government Media Office in Gaza condemned the attack, calling it a \u201cmassacre against civilians\u201d by Israel. The government statement also called on the international community, the United Nations, and international NGOs to put pressure on Israel and the United States to stop the war in Gaza. The commissioner-general of the UN\u2019s agency for Palestinian refugees (UNWRA), Philippe Lazzarini, condemned the attack, warning \u201cthe blatant disregard of international humanitarian law cannot become the new normal.\u201d \u201cSchools have gone from safe places of education and hope for children to overcrowded shelters and often ending up a place of death and misery,\u201d he posted on X. \u201cNine months in, under our watch, the relentless, endless killings, destruction and despair continue. Gaza is no place for children.\u201d This comes days after an\u00a0Israeli\u00a0attack killed at least 16 Palestinians and injured dozens more at a school run by the United Nations\u2019 agency for Palestinian refugees in central Gaza, the Palestinian Ministry of Health said on Saturday. UNRWA\u2019s Al-Jaouni school was sheltering displaced people in al-Nuseirat camp, according to the ministry. The Israeli military said in a statement Saturday that militants were operating in structures in the school area. CNN cannot independently verify the Israeli military\u2019s claim. On July 1, the IDF issued instructions for hundreds of thousands of people in Khan Younis in the south, Shujaya in central Gaza and\u00a0the several neighborhoods of Gaza City to leave. The effect has been to increase the total number of displaced people in Gaza, from 1.7 million in May to an estimated 1.9 million now, according to the UN. Approximately nine out of 10 people in Gaza are now estimated to be internally displaced, many of them multiple times. The IDF has said that evacuation orders are necessary so that civilians don\u2019t get caught up in its renewed operations in areas where Hamas is seeking to re-establish a presence. The IDF insists it goes to great lengths to avoid civilian casualties. Human rights bodies have repeatedly criticized Israeli relocation orders. In May, the Norwegian Refugee Council warned the absence of safety assurances and proper accommodation for displaced Palestinians is a form of \u201cforcible transfer, amounting to a serious violation of international law.\u201d Hamas has said the evacuations threaten to return negotiations for a ceasefire and hostage deal to \u201cpoint zero.\u201d Humanitarian agencies say the evacuation orders have had a major impact on the few operational hospitals in Gaza. Besides the obvious dangers in moving from one part of Gaza to another, the constant displacements make it harder for aid agencies to target the provision of food.

{"id": "2024_07_10_middleeast_palestinian-patients-evacutation-gaza-war-uae-floating-hospital-mime-intl", "text": "Aged just four, Julia Abu Zeiter suffers from a rare neurological disease that can be fatal without medication. The nine-month war in Gaza nearly took Julia\u2019s life, as the fighting and displacement cut off her access to treatment. After an arduous journey, she was finally evacuated from the war-torn enclave on June 27, accompanied only by her 21-year-old aunt, Dareen Zeiter. \u201cThe displacement was really difficult, the events in Gaza are very difficult. What Julia saw was very harsh,\u201d Dareen told CNN. Julia suffers from a rare neurological disorder called alternating hemiplegia of childhood, or AHC. It causes recurrent episodes of paralysis and life-threatening seizures. No cure exists for the illness, which is estimated to occur in approximately one in a million births. Its patients are referred to as \u201chuman time bombs\u201d and need to constantly be monitored for signs of an oncoming episode. As soon as it strikes, lifesaving measures must quickly be administered. CNN met with Julia and Dareen aboard a floating hospital run by the United Arab Emirates, where they had been staying for a week after leaving Gaza through Israel\u2019s Kerem Shalom crossing in the south. The two Palestinians were among around a dozen patients leaving the floating hospital to continue their treatment in the Emirati capital Abu Dhabi. Most of those patients are children, including two suffering from Leukemia. Gaza\u2019s \u2018invisible victims\u2019 Moored off the coast of Arish on the north coast of Egypt\u2019s Sinai Peninsula, the hospital is some 40 kilometers from Rafah, the southernmost city in the Gaza strip that now lies in ruins after Israel launched its ground operation there in May. The city also housed the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, a crucial land bridge through which two-thirds of aid entering Gaza passed. The crossing has been closed since it was seized by the Israeli military. The 100-bed UAE ship has received 2,400 injured Palestinians since February, according to the hospital director, Dr. Ahmed Mubarak. Julia is \u201can invisible victim\u201d of the war, Mubarak said, caught up in what M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, also known as Doctors Without Borders, described as Gaza\u2019s \u201csilent killings, the result of deliberate deprivation.\u201d The organization\u2019s head of emergency programs, Mari Carmen Vi\u00f1oles, said in May that Israel\u2019s \u201cblockades, delays, and restrictions on humanitarian aid and essential medical supplies\u201d have made aid deliveries impossible. Julia and Dareen are two of countless Palestinians displaced by the war in Gaza, which Israel launched in response to Hamas\u2019 October 7 attack that killed 1,200 people in Israel and took more than 250 others hostage, according to Israeli authorities. Israel\u2019s war has killed more than 38,000 people in Gaza, according to the health ministry there. Swathes of the enclave have been turned to rubble and almost the entire strip\u2019s population of two million is internally displaced. Julia and Dareen were forced to leave their home in northern Gaza when the war began. The four-year-old witnessed \u201cexplosions and shelling\u201d throughout, her aunt said. A punishing siege by Israel has choked the enclave, bringing humanitarian aid down to a trickle and preventing Gazans moving in and out. For Julia, this meant running out of her medication, which triggered a series of life-threatening seizures. Around a month into the war, Julia ran out of three of the five medications she was taking, Dareen told CNN. This triggered a state of paralysis for six months. With the help of the Palestine Children\u2019s Relief Fund (PCRF), a US-based non-governmental organization, Julia was able to finally evacuate through Israel\u2019s Kerem Shalom crossing, Dareen said. \u2018Hunger is what destroys us\u2019 Down the hall of makeshift wards from Julia was Ibrahim, who was injured in his family home in Jabalya, northern Gaza, when an airstrike hit their building on November 21. He had turned seven that day. Ibrahim was aboard the ship with his aunt, Alaa, 21. Alaa and Ibrahim were both injured in the airstrike, having survived after being pulled from the rubble, Alaa said. The aunt sustained critical burns, while Ibrahim broke his arm and leg, she said. The boy\u2019s injuries did not heal properly, requiring further treatment. \u201cIbrahim and I were the only two survivors,\u201d Alaa told CNN, adding that the airstrike killed 30 members of their family. They left Gaza on April 28 through the Rafah crossing, just a week before Israeli forces seized control of it. \u201cLook, this is my dad,\u201d Ibrahim said, holding up a photo of his father, who died during the airstrike, on his aunt\u2019s phone. Before losing their home and family, Alaa and Ibrahim remained in northern Gaza until April, when residents were experiencing severe hunger as aid struggled to reach them amid Israel\u2019s military operations and what humanitarian aid officials said was increased lawlessness and looting of trucks there. In mid-March, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) assessed that famine is \u201cimminent\u201d in northern Gaza and said it was projected to occur between then and May. On Tuesday, the United Nations, citing a report by independent experts, said that the recent deaths of more Palestinian children due to hunger and malnutrition in Gaza indicates famine has spread across the entire strip, decrying Israel\u2019s \u201cintentional and targeted starvation campaign against the Palestinian people\u201d as a \u201cform of genocidal violence\u201d. \u201cThere was unbelievable hunger,\u201d Alaa told CNN, sitting on a hospital bed as Ibrahim stood by. \u201cWe lived through hunger, the main ingredients for food weren\u2019t there,\u201d Alaa told CNN. \u201cHunger was harder on us than the war itself,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cThose who have died, died. But hunger is what destroys us.\u201d While Julia and Ibrahim have made it out, millions of others remain trapped in the war zone, with few signs of a ceasefire deal in sight. Nearly 26,000 children have been killed or injured in Gaza in six months, the aid group Save the Children said in April, just over 2% of Gaza\u2019s entire child population. \u201cEven amid the complexities of war, how can we not grasp one universal truth: a child is a child,\u201d UNICEF spokesperson James Elder said last month, calling for \u201ca ceasefire (that) gets hostages home, and stops the killing of children.\u201d Dareen, Julia\u2019s aunt, said the responsibility over her niece was too big to shoulder. \u201cShe needs her mother and father. I can\u2019t be her mother and father at the same time.\u201d she told CNN. \u201cAt the end of the day, I am a child that crossed with a child.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/10/middleeast/palestinian-patients-evacutation-gaza-war-uae-floating-hospital-mime-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "style_philippines-worlds-oldest-tattoo-artist-intl-hnk", "text": "The first sound I heard upon reaching Buscalan was that of heaving and panting. A group of us had just completed a steep climb to the remote village, which is tucked deep into the undulating mountains of the Philippines\u2019 Kalinga province. But, like me, my fellow travelers didn\u2019t make this 12-hour journey just for the breathtaking views of rolling rice terraces \u2014 we were there to meet Apo Whang-Od Oggay. At 107 years old, Whang-Od is the world\u2019s oldest tattoo artist. She\u2019s been practicing \u201cbatok,\u201d a traditional form of tattooing used by the region\u2019s indigenous tribes, since she was just a teenager. For over nine decades, she\u2019s been hand-tapping tattoos inspired by agriculture and the local landscape. She has inked tribal warriors with elaborate geometric patterns and women of the Butbut tribe with symbols of fertility. We were not tribe members, however, just determined road-trippers. Prior to the climb, we had driven for hours under the scorching sun, following road signs with printed photos of Whang-Od. The centenarian\u2019s fame draws a stream of daily tourists to Buscalan, spawning a burgeoning tattoo industry in this otherwise agricultural village. Across the mountain, about a dozen other (and significantly younger) villagers sat with visitors hammering away at symbols of mountains, ferns and snakeskin. A local guide added our names to Whang-Od\u2019s waitlist, and we wandered around the rest of the day, sipping on piping hot barako coffee. We strolled narrow alleys and saw the tattooist\u2019s face on almost everything \u2014 from T-shirts to bracelets and coffee packaging \u2014 on sale at stalls around the village. As our time slot neared, we returned to the waiting area, watching as the line slowly crept along. At this point, Whang-Od had been tapping out tattoos, machine-like, for hours, and I worried that she was overworking herself. I was one of over a hundred people getting tattooed by her that day. Some were foreigners, while others were Filipinos from different provinces across the archipelago. Many were, like me, Filipinos by heritage who grew up overseas and were looking to experience our own culture first-hand, beyond the stories told by our parents. Just before sunset, it was my turn to sit before Whang-Od, who was hunched over on a small stool. I stared at her in awe. She was dressed in a loose, colorful tie-die shirt and bold patterned pants, her own tribal tattoos on full display. This was my first tattoo and I was nervous. But her wrinkled, bespectacled face softened as her red lips smiled at me kindly. I handed her the tattooing instrument, which I had earlier purchased as a souvenir \u2014 a needle fashioned from a pomelo and attached to the top of a handcrafted bamboo stick. She dipped it into a mixture of coal and water. I quickly rubbed my forearm with an alcohol wipe and pointed to the place where I wanted my tattoo. Within seconds she was hammering away. Her taps echoed \u2014 \u201ctak-tak-tak\u201d \u2014 around the makeshift shed outside her home. My arm bled and hurt like it had been pinched continuously at the same spot. Enduring stigma Batok, or indigenous Filipino tattooing, has been around for more than a thousand years. The elaborate designs once adorned both men and women, signifying everything from valor to strength and protection. But the traditional art form fell out of favor, partly due to its association with the outlawed practice of headhunting (historically, men would receive chest tattoos after returning with the head of a dead enemy). Landlocked high in the mountains, the Kalinga region remained effectively independent during more than 300 years of Spanish colonial rule, its tattooed warriors fiercely fighting off outsiders. When American Catholic missionaries eventually arrived to build schools in the 20th century, village girls \u2014 who often bore tattoos symbolizing their coming of age \u2014 were forced to cover their arms with long sleeves. Being tattooed came to be viewed as a mark of shame whenever villagers went to nearby cities, as urban Filipinos often considered the practice \u201cbackwards.\u201d In recent decades, tattoos\u2019 popularity among criminal gangs has cast further stigma on the art. \u201cGrowing up in the Philippines tattoos were definitely frowned upon, especially for religious families, because of the negative connotations and the criminal association,\u201d said Kent Donguines, the Filipino-Canadian director of an upcoming documentary about Whang-Od, \u201cTreasure of the Rice Terraces.\u201d As I can now attest, this stigma lives on today. After seeing my new tattoo, my Catholic-raised father, who grew up in Manila, did not speak to me for a whole week. Seemingly unmoved by the story of my trip to Buscalan, he warned me I was living a \u201ccrazy life.\u201d But perceptions are shifting \u2014 and this may be thanks, in part, to Whang-Od. Although known locally for decades, Whang-Od shot to fame after tattoo anthropologist Lars Krutak featured her in the Discovery Channel series \u201cTattoo Hunter,\u201d which aired in 2009. (The Discovery Channel is owned by CNN\u2019s parent company, Warner Bros Discovery) Word quickly spread. Travel vloggers, news crews and Filipino celebrities all ventured out to meet her. Whang-Od graced the cover of Vogue Philippines in April 2023, making her the oldest person to front any edition of the acclaimed magazine. Earlier this year, a former Miss Universe Philippines contestant, Michelle Dee, got inked by Whang-Od after competing in the pageant wearing a costume inspired by her tattoo designs. The 107-year-old\u2019s international renown has ignited a wider conversation about Filipino identity. Tattoo enthusiasts say her work celebrates aspects of pre-colonial culture, demystifying preconceived taboos and honoring batok as a mark of belonging. According to folklore and Krutak\u2019s research, the practice was passed down through families, but often only to the men. Whang-Od learned the art from her father who was considered a master tattooist in the region and saw potential in her skills. The symbols she tattooed \u2014 ranging from geometric lines, circles, animals and tribal prints \u2014 all carried a specific meaning. Some designs represented the landscape, local crops (like bundles of rice). Celestial symbols and depictions of the sea have also been added to the list of designs. Over time, her tattoos have also become symbols of peace. According to Krutak, who has studied decades\u2019 worth of Whang-Od\u2019s work, she has even inked neighboring tribes like the Bontoc, who were traditionally enemies, traveling (most likely by foot along dirt paths, he said) to attend their tribal ceremonies. Changing traditions Buscalan is still relatively untouched by modern conveniences. There\u2019s no cellphone reception, though a handful of vendors instead sell Wi-Fi access to visitors (local tour guides use walkie-talkies to communicate). Most families still sustain themselves by growing rice. But this rural area is \u2014 for better or worse \u2014 evolving as Whang-Od and her apprentices attract more and more tourists. During my visit, I passed a town hall meeting being conducted on a covered basketball court. A provincial representative told a crowd of elders that the village needed to track visitor numbers to determine how many new water tanks and garbage disposal areas should be built. Krutak said a growing number of locals now make a living through tourism, though village leaders often tell him they should not forget that they are primarily an agricultural community. \u201cTheir ancestors shed a lot of blood to protect the village at the top of the mountain, they put it there for a reason,\u201d Krutak said. Whang-Od often says that material possessions disappear when you die, but tattoos are the only things you can take to the afterlife, Krutak added, recalling his many conversations with her. And despite Whang-Od\u2019s impressive old age, she is not immortal. The tattooist\u2019s family has prepared a crypt for her, tucked away up the mountain, with a giant statue of her surrounded by photographs, awards and memorabilia from the thousands of visitors she has inked over her lifetime. As Whang-Od sat before me, I felt myself holding my breath, struggling to find the words to communicate, despite us both being Filipinos. I speak Tagalog but she only speaks her tribal language and the regional language, Ilocano. A placard hanging from the corrugated roof above us offered some help. Reading it I mumbled \u201cmanjamanan,\u201d thanking her. I thought to myself that despite the decades between us, we were fortunate to spend those 10 minutes together, so I could experience this tradition passed down by our ancestors. The tattoo she gave me is, these days, her signature design: three simple dots. With her fading eyesight and the volume of daily customers, Whang-Od has had to simplify her tattoos in order to see everyone. \u201c(My friends who gave tattoos) have all passed away,\u201d Whang-Od told CNN in an interview in 2017.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m the only one left alive that\u2019s still giving tattoos. But I\u2019m not afraid that the tradition will end because (I\u2019m training) the next tattoo masters.\u201d The three dots represent herself and her two grandnieces, Grace Palicas and Elyang Wigan, both of whom she is training as apprentices. To many, including myself, the dots can also be seen as ellipses, a mark symbolizing that the art and stories from her village will live on \u2014 that even when she passes away, this ancient art will be shared for generations to come.", "source": "http://cnn.com/style/philippines-worlds-oldest-tattoo-artist-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_04_10_style_graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers", "text": "Climbing up abandoned, unfinished floors and tightrope walking across balcony ledges, backpacks clanging with cans of alkyd and acrylic, a collective of Los Angeles graffiti artists have transformed their craft beyond urban aesthetics to champion community issues. Their choice of canvas: Oceanwide Plaza in Downtown LA. Occupying over a full square city block, the plaza was imagined as a vast mixed-use building project, offering city residents over 500 lavish condominiums, a five-star hotel, retail spaces, restaurants and a private 2-acre park. However, construction on the $1 billion project, which began in 2015, was shelved after the Chinese-backed contractor Oceanwide Holdings ran out of funding\u00a0in 2019 \u2014 and it has lain unfinished ever since. The plaza\u2019s status \u2014 and potential \u2014 as an eye-catching venue for their work spread by word of mouth within the graffiti community in recent months. Security at the site was known to be lax, an important detail as accessing the plaza\u2019s towers and other buildings constitutes trespassing. (The Los Angeles City Attorney confirmed to CNN that, as of April 3, criminal charges have been filed against 23 individuals, for violations including trespassing and possession of vandalism tools.) \u201cIt was like a gift from the graffiti gods\u2026 A giant canvas in the middle of downtown,\u201d tagger ENDEM told CNN, speaking on behalf of himself and his graffiti crew, NCT. \u201cWe were like, \u2018Let\u2019s do it right. Let\u2019s do it as if the whole world is going to see this.\u2019\u201d Historically, graffiti has often been used as protest art. While the practice dates back thousands of years, it\u2019s most commonly viewed in a contemporary context (within graffiti\u2019s \u201cmodern\u201d era, which dates back to the 1960s and 70s) as a creative vehicle for challenging societal norms and inequities \u2014 whether on the Berlin Wall in Germany or subway cars in New York City; whether painted by anonymous artists or well-known figures like Keith Haring or Banksy, even if the latter is, technically, anonymous himself. Still, neither ENDEM nor any of the other artists involved realized how famous their work on the Oceanside towers would become. Sharing his artwork on Instagram on January 31, a video from ENDEM quickly racked up tens of thousands of views: Vibrant images of bright block lettering splayed across the building\u2019s exterior paired with footage from the inside \u2014 the artist posing with shots of his spray paint cans, poised above the cityscape. The viral footage, among other visuals shared on social media, quickly opened the floodgates. Hitting Oceanside became a mark of credibility in the graffiti world; by mid-February, the number of tags and other graffiti pieces there were multiplying overnight. \u201cIt was an open house people going in and out. It was beautiful. It was like graffiti paradise,\u201d ENDEM said. \u201cIt felt exactly like the streets, but concentrated.\u201d Transformed in part into an art installation, Oceanwide became an opportunity for the graffiti artists to leave a message to the city below, and a call-out to policy makers who leave buildings to rot. \u201cGraffiti shows you where the city hurts,\u201d Roger Gastman, owner and founder of the LA-based arts organization Beyond the Streets, told CNN. Renowned for its large-scale exhibitions, immersive educational programs, pop-up events and partnerships, Beyond the Streets works to educate and celebrate the diverse dimensions of graffiti as a medium. To him, the mission of graffiti is clear: to challenge, educate, and redefine public perception of the medium. Earl Ofari Hutchinson, president of The Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable, a nonpartisan public policy forum\u00a0for civic participation and education,\u00a0sees the abandoned towers as amplifying the social issues of the community they are situated in, connecting the graffiti-laden structures to the urban blight that surrounds them in LA\u2019s Skid Row. Skid Row is a 50-block sector of downtown LA where between 8,000 and 11,000 unhoused people live in challenging, often squalid conditions. \u201cYou\u2019ve got tens of thousands of people displaced because of over urban development. And as a result of that, they\u2019re on the streets,\u201d Hutchinson told CNN, noting that the homeless population in Los Angeles is continuing to grow. (The Los Angeles Housing Services Authority reports a 9% increase in homelessness in LA county in 2023 and a 10% increase in the city from 2022.) \u201cNow, set right in the middle of that, you have\u2026 a development that will never be completed.\u201d \u201cWhat you have here is a classic urban nightmare brought on by very poor policies \u2014 fiscal, financial, budgetary and political problems (in) a city that has just gone off the rails in terms of over-development and lack of affordability,\u201d Hutchinson added. Still, Hutchinson is no fan of the graffiti either. To him, and many other LA residents who have said they disapprove of the \u201cvandalism,\u201d the plaza is a sore sight for eyes. \u201cThe problem is you\u2019re talking about violating public space and with no permission\u2026 that doesn\u2019t fly with me,\u201d Hutchinson said. \u201cThe fact of the matter is, the public has not given you approval. (And) the general public has to pay for the removal.\u201d Costs currently borne by the taxpayer at the Oceanwide Plaza site include the security details provided by the LAPD as well as the graffiti cleanup Hutchinson highlights. (\u201cThis has strained our deployment,\u201d LAPD Chief Michel Moore said during a February meeting of the Los Angeles City Council. \u201cWe have called in some officers on an overtime basis so that we can provide for these added patrols or station them at that site to deter vandals and others from gaining access.\u201d) Clean teams working in the neighborhoods surrounding Oceanwide remove on average some 2,000 square feet of graffiti per week, with that figure growing in recent months. \u201cPeople forget that people live here. People own businesses here and they don\u2019t want to have to spend the time and money to clean it up,\u201d said Blair Besten, executive director of the Historic Core of Downtown Los Angeles, an organization which works to improve the quality of life in downtown neighborhoods. The Historic Core prioritizes street sweeping, trash collection \u2014 and graffiti removal. \u201cI would hardly call what they\u2019re doing art,\u201d Besten argued of the Oceanwide taggers. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty sloppy and quick. They come in fast and they knock it out and they leave.\u201d But to Gastman, graffiti is a powerful form of expression, and a call-to-action \u2014 particularly for those who emanate from struggles within home life, gang life or societal turmoil. Graffiti culture can offer an unexpected support system for those the city has abandoned, Gastman said. It becomes a platform for them to make their voices heard. \u201cIn graffiti culture, a lot of us know each other. We\u2019re all friends. We have the same mentality \u2014 we\u2019re just trying to get up. We\u2019re just trying to get noticed,\u201d explained ENDEM. In the midst of an addiction that led to his rock bottom, graffiti became his lifeline, he explained. \u201cI was at my lowest of lows, still trying to stay sober, I needed some type of outlet,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cGraffiti is something that you can hold on to. Its bigger than me, its everyone, it\u2019s a community.\u201d In this, ENDEM believes that the beauty of Oceanwide isn\u2019t tangible. Rather, it lies in the birth of a new generation of graffiti writers. \u201cThey can erase the graffiti on buildings, but they can never erase the impact that it has on the city of Los Angeles and the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to it. Yes, it\u2019s vandalism. Yes, it\u2019s art, and it\u2019s everything in between,\u201d Gastman concluded. \u201cThis is a real culture. It\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/10/style/graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "sport_omar-al-marzouqi-uae-showjumping-olympics-spt-spc", "text": "Soaring over fences on horseback in Hangzhou, China, last October, Omar Al Marzouqi was jumping into history. Four thousand miles away, back home in Abu Dhabi, his sister joined a Zoom class for a university lecture to help her brother take down key notes. With his Olympics debut galloping ever closer, 21-year-old Omar is making his name as the showjumping star of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), but his juggling skills are equally as impressive. At the Asian Games in China, Al Marzouqi notched two medals \u2013 an individual silver and team bronze \u2013 to help power the UAE to an unprecedented three-medal haul. A few months later, he aced an entirely different set of examinations to collect his double bachelor\u2019s degree in philosophy and sociology. As he competed at events across the globe, Al Marzouqi often found himself in wildly different time zones to Sorbonne University Abu Dhabi \u2013 a French and English-speaking affiliate of the Paris-based university in the UAE\u2019s capital \u2013 making for a grueling final year of studies. Yet Al Marzouqi made it work \u2013 with a little help from his sister. \u201cI like to set high challenges and try to make it possible \u2026 the support I got from my family was unbelievable,\u201d he told CNN. Showjumping has always a family affair for Al Marzouqi, who mounted his first pony at just three years old. His first taste of international competition arrived at just 12 years old, a rapid rise under the expert eye of his father, a former rider who trained some of the nation\u2019s best jumpers before turning his attention to his son. Al Marzouqi has no shortage of heroes in the sport \u2013 Switzerland\u2019s Steve Guerdat and Germany\u2019s Christian Ahlmann to name just two \u2013 but his father is his greatest influence, with the duo running their own stable. \u201cI\u2019m really lucky to have a trainer like my dad,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was tough on me for a long time but at least it paid off.\u201d His father was in tears in 2018 as he watched his son hoist aloft his silver medal at the Youth Olympics in Argentina, the first time an Emirati had ever stepped foot on the podium at the tournament. Just 15 years old at the time, Al Marzouqi was comfortably the youngest rider in the field in Buenos Aires. Jump forward to 2024, and he is not only used to the questions about his age from wide-eyed competitors, he relishes them. \u201cShow jumping is my lifestyle\u201d Al Marzouqi will saddle up for his biggest test yet at the Paris Olympics later this month, carrying the UAE flag into the opening ceremony on July 26 as his country sends an equestrian team to the Games for the first time ever. The UAE\u2019s qualification is a significant milestone for the country, where horsemanship has a long and rich history among the Bedouin people, and where horses are a cherished cultural symbol, taking center stage in national day celebrations each year. For Al Marzouqi, continuing that lineage is a privilege. \u201cShow jumping is my lifestyle. Horses are just amazing. It\u2019s a difficult sport, because you\u2019ve got a soul under you that might get scared of anything. You have to really control the brain and to stay focused for this one minute \u2026 it\u2019s a lot of work.\u201d The youngster has had three months to develop a close connection with his horse, Enjoy de la Mure, their partnership emboldened by a Grand Prix victory in Montefalco, Italy, in May. The win sends him into Paris full of optimism in his pursuit of what would be a truly stunning medal. Only twice has an athlete from the UAE ascended the podium at a Games; shooter Ahmed Al Maktoum winning gold at Athens 2004 before Sergiu Toma won a judo bronze in Rio in 2016. Even Al Marzouqi hasn\u2019t been able to stop his thoughts from drifting to the vision of a medal around his neck, but the 21-year-old is realistic about his chances. \u201cI think to any athlete, winning an Olympic medal, you\u2019d be living in the clouds,\u201d he said. \u201cThe team looks good, the horses look fabulous, but we need some luck for the day. I hope for a medal obviously, but I just want to represent my country in the best way possible and try to make them proud of me.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/sport/omar-al-marzouqi-uae-showjumping-olympics-spt-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_08_middleeast_israel-hamas-ceasefire-hostage-deal-demands-explainer-mime-intl", "text": "Optimism about an Israel-Hamas ceasefire-hostage agreement waned this week as Israel set conditions for the deal and Hamas warned that Israeli actions in Gaza could jeopardize the talks. Last week, a US official told CNN that a framework agreement is \u201cin place\u201d and an Israeli official said that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had authorized his negotiators to enter into detailed negotiations, signaling a potential breakthrough. Talks resumed in the Qatari capital Doha on Friday. Over the weekend, Hamas agreed to compromise on a major sticking point for Israel, that the Jewish state commit to a permanent ceasefire in Gaza before signing an agreement. But a statement by the Israeli prime minister\u2019s office on Sunday cast doubt on whether the deal would progress, laying out several \u201cprinciples\u201d Israel is not prepared to abandon, including resumed fighting in Gaza \u201cuntil all of objectives of the war have been achieved.\u201d Israel launched its war on Gaza nine months ago, in response to Hamas\u2019 October 7 attack that killed 1,200 people and took more than 250 others hostage, according to Israeli authorities. The war has left swathes of the enclave unrecognizable, displaced almost the entire population and killed more than 38,000 people in Gaza, according to the health ministry there. Israel had said it wouldn\u2019t end the war until all hostages are freed and Hamas is eliminated. Some experts say Netanyahu\u2019s statement on Sunday suggests the deal may face new hurdles. The prime minister\u2019s conditions block \u201cany possibility of progress from the Israeli side,\u201d Gershon Baskin, a former Israeli hostage negotiator who once acted as a channel to Hamas, told CNN, adding that the conditions were \u201ccompletely against what Hamas\u2019 demands are.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think that Hamas will give in to additional Israeli demands,\u201d such as staying on the Philadelphi Corridor, Baskin said, referring to the 14-kilometer (about 8.7-mile) buffer zone on the Egypt-Gaza border. Hamas is also unlikely to agree to an Israeli demand of \u201ca veto on the selection of Palestinian prisoners to be released.\u201d Here\u2019s what we know about where the talks stand. What is the deal that is on the table? US President Joe Biden in May laid out a three-phase proposal that he said Israel had submitted, as he declared \u201cit\u2019s time for this war to end.\u201d The first phase of the potential agreement would last six weeks and include the \u201cwithdrawal of Israeli forces from all populated areas of Gaza\u201d as well as the \u201crelease of a number of hostages, including women, the elderly, the wounded in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.\u201d Phase 2 would allow for the \u201cexchange for the release of all remaining living hostages, including male soldiers.\u201d In Phase 3, the president said, a \u201cmajor reconstruction plan for Gaza would commence and any final remains of hostages who\u2019ve been killed will be returned to their families.\u201d On Thursday, a senior US administration told CNN\u00a0that the framework for a deal is \u201cnow in place,\u201d following a call between Biden and Netanyahu. An Israeli source familiar with the negotiations echoed a similar message earlier on Wednesday, telling CNN the two sides appear to be on the brink of a framework agreement. What is Hamas\u2019 position? Hamas has long demanded that Israel agree to a permanent ceasefire before signing any deal, which Israel has so far refused. A senior Hamas official \u2013 who had been involved in negotiations \u2013 told CNN Saturday the group would instead accept that talks on reaching a permanent ceasefire would take place throughout the first phase of any deal, which would last six weeks. This means, in the first phase, mediators would guarantee a temporary truce, the delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza and the withdrawal of Israeli troops. Indirect talks\u00a0would continue towards implementing the second phase of the agreement. But as Israel issued new evacuation orders in Gaza city on Sunday, Hamas said on Monday that the move threatens to return the negotiating process to \u201cpoint zero.\u201d Netanyahu and his army bear full responsibility for the collapse of this negotiation path,\u201d the head of the group\u2019s political bureau, Ismail Haniyeh, said. What is Netanyahu\u2019s position? An Israeli source familiar with the negotiations told CNN last week that Israeli officials believe Hamas\u2019 latest response will enable the two parties to enter detailed negotiations to reach an agreement. Netanyahu subsequently authorized his negotiators to enter into detailed talks in a bid to broker a deal, an Israeli official and a source familiar with the negotiations said, signaling progress after weeks of deadlock. In a statement Sunday, however, Netanyahu\u2019s office published a list of principles that it said will not be infringed upon by the plan agreed to by Israel and Biden. The prime minister\u2019s \u201csteadfast position\u201d against calls to halt Israeli military action in the southern Gaza city of Rafah is what brought Hamas to the negotiating table, the statement said. The principles include a resumption of the war until \u201call of objectives of the war have been achieved\u201d and the prevention of \u201csmuggling of weapons to Hamas from Egypt to the Gaza border.\u201d Israel began a ground operation in Rafah on\u00a0May 7, crossing the Philadelphi Corridor and seizing the Palestinian side of the border with Egypt. Israel has long accused Hamas of using the Philadelphi corridor to smuggle weapons from Egypt. Netanyahu also said there will be \u201cno return of thousands of armed terrorists to the northern Gaza Strip,\u201d the statement said. What is the White House saying? A US official told CNN Thursday that last week\u2019s call between Biden and Netanyahu seemed to reach a \u201cbreakthrough\u201d on the transition from Phase 1 to Phase 2, adding that the deal is now \u201cvery consistent\u201d with what Biden had laid out in May. Asked if the administration believes that Netanyahu is playing politics and could try to sabotage the deal, the official said the deal is structured in a way that \u201cfully protects Israel\u2019s interests.\u201d The developments came after the US proposed new language to help bridge gaps in discussions for a deal, and as Biden scrambled for political survival after floundering in a presidential debate against his predecessor Donald Trump. Biden\u2019s handling of the Israel-Hamas conflict has been a key issue for voters. Are the two sides closer to a deal? Prospects of a deal appeared to become distant again this week after Netanyahu\u2019s demands, as senior Israeli politicians from accross the political spectrum publicly chided the prime minister over his handling of the war and the hostage talks. Far-right members of Netanyahu\u2019s government, whom he relies on to keep his government intact, warned him against making compromises with Hamas. Minister of National Security Itamar Ben Gvir warned that a negotiated settlement is a \u201csurrender to terrorism on all fronts,\u201d and said \u201cthe prime minister conducts himself as a one-man government, making decisions by himself, and excluding his natural partners in the government, including cabinet meetings that are without any significant content,\u201d describing the situation as \u201cintolerable.\u201d Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, told his party that the proposed outline of a ceasefire deal was a defeat and humiliation for Israel and a victory for Sinwar,\u201d Hamas\u2019 leader in Gaza. \u201cWe will not be part of a deal to surrender to Hamas,\u201d Smotrich said. \u201cThe people of Israel, the bereaved families and the IDF fighters demand victory.\u00a0We must not disappoint them.\u00a0We must not endanger the country.\u201d Meanwhile, the chairman of the National Unity party, Benny Gantz, who left the war cabinet last month after repeated disagreements with Netanyahu, accused the prime minister of prioritizing the survival of his government over bringing back the hostages. \u201cYesterday the prime minister linked bringing back the hostages to bringing down the government. Today, Ben Gvir connects a seat in the limited cabinet with political votes in the Knesset. Israel\u2019s security during the most difficult campaign in its history became a victim of political whims.\u201d Opposition leader Yair Lapid criticized the prime minister\u2019s statement as \u201cprovocative.\u201d \u201cWhat is it good for? We are at a critical moment in the negotiations, the lives of the abductees depend on it,\u201d Lapid wrote Sunday on X.\u00a0\u201cWhy issue such provocative messages? How does it contribute to the process?\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a hostage deal on the table,\u201d he said later. \u201cIt is not true that Netanyahu has to choose between the hostage deal and his continued tenure as prime minister. I promised him a safety net, and I will keep that promise. If Smotrich and Ben Gvir retire, he will get a safety net.\u201d  Baskin, the former negotiator, said that added US pressure is unlikely to sway the Israeli prime minister, who is battling for political survival amid anti-government protests demanding his resignation. US pressure is \u201cstrongly diminished now\u201d after Biden\u2019s debate against Trump, Baskin said. Biden\u2019s weak debate performance only led more Democrats to express doubts that he can beat his opponent in the upcoming election. \u201cIf the Americans are still optimistic (after Netanyahu\u2019s Sunday statement), then they are really living in La La land,\u201d Baskin told CNN. \u201cThey have really no idea what is going on in the mind of Netanyahu.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/middleeast/israel-hamas-ceasefire-hostage-deal-demands-explainer-mime-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "world"}}

The remnant is the tail section of the munition, according to three explosive weapons experts who reviewed the video for CNN. \u201cBased on the characteristic shape of the fin, the screw housings, as well as the overall shape of the munition fragment\u2026 this remnant is consistent with a GBU-39-series tail actuation system located in the rear of the munition,\u201d Patrick Senft, a research coordinator at Armament Research Services (ARES), told CNN. Trevor Ball, a former US Army explosive ordnance disposal technician, also told CNN the remnants were of a tail actuation section of an SDB/GBU-39. \u201cPart of the section is missing, showing a cutaway of the internals,\u201d Ball tweeted. Israel said it was targeting a Hamas operative in the strike. In a statement Tuesday, the Israeli military said: \u201cEarlier this evening, using precise munition, the [Israeli air force] struck a terrorist from Hamas\u2019 military wing who took part, among other terrorist activities, in the October 7 brutal massacre.\u201d CNN has asked the IDF about the use of US-made munitions used in the Khan Younis strike. CNN identified remnants of GBU-39 small-diameter bombs in another two Israeli strikes in the past few months. The GBU-39, which is manufactured by Boeing, is a high-precision munition \u201cdesigned to attack strategically important point targets\u201d and result in low collateral damage, explosive weapons expert Chris Cobb-Smith told CNN following the first strike on Rafah tent camp, which took place on May 26. \u201cUsing any munition, even of this size, will always incur risks in a densely populated area,\u201d said Cobb-Smith, who is also a former British Army artillery officer.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/10/middleeast/israel-us-munitions-school-strike-khan-younis-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_07_05_europe_popes-chief-of-staff-london-property-trial-intl-latam", "text": "One of Pope Francis\u2019 closest aides has undergone an intense cross-examination as he gave evidence in a case that marks the first time the Vatican has stood trial in an English court. Archbishop Edgar Pe\u00f1a Parra, who holds the role of \u201csostituto\u201d (\u201csubstitute\u201d), the equivalent of a papal chief of staff, took the witness stand in a dispute over the Holy See\u2019s disastrous investment in a London property, the center of the Vatican\u2019s\u00a0\u201ctrial of the century\u201d. The archbishop\u2019s appearance in court is rare given the Vatican and its senior officials have largely avoided legal actions in foreign courts \u2013 often concerning sexual abuse cases \u2013 under the protection of sovereign immunity. But the London legal action is believed to be the first time the Vatican has stood trial in a foreign jurisdiction, while Archbishop Pe\u00f1a Parra is one of the highest-ranking Vatican officials to give evidence in such a case. The 64-year-old Venezuelan archbishop wore a black clerical suit during his evidence and began by swearing an oath on \u201calmighty God\u201d that he would tell the truth. Although he was occasionally assisted by an interpreter, he answered questions in English. Over more than a day and a half of cross-examination, the archbishop insisted several times that he is a \u201cpriest, and not a specialist in banking\u201d as he explained that the Vatican had been the victim of extortion in the property deal. The case against the Holy See has been bought by Raffaele Mincione, an Italian-British financier who was among those convicted by a Vatican court last December of embezzlement and self-laundering for his part in the London property deal. Mincione has denied all the charges against him and is appealing his convictions. That trial marked the first time a cardinal was convicted and sentenced by a Vatican court for financial crimes and is considered an important moment\u00a0in Pope Francis\u2019 long battle to clean up the Vatican\u2019s finances. But Mincione is now seeking a ruling in the London courts that he acted in\u00a0\u201cgood faith\u201d throughout his dealings with the Vatican, which concerned\u00a0investments in a\u00a0vast property in southwest London\u2019s Chelsea neighborhood,\u00a0originally\u00a0built as a car showroom for the Harrods department store. The Holy See says it spent around $400 million on the deal over several years but ended up with losses of $150 million after eventually selling the asset. In 2014, the Vatican invested $200 million for a 45% stake in the Chelsea property through a fund run by Mincione, whose companies had purchased the building for around $165 million (\u00a3129.5 million) at the end of 2012. Although there was a plan to turn the property into apartments, the Vatican says the property\u2019s value was inflated by Mincione and that it was losing money on its investment. Archbishop Pe\u00f1a Parra, who was not in post at the time of the original investment, sought to exit the deal by buying the building outright and, in the process, the Holy See paid \u00a340 million to Mincione. The Vatican says this was a \u201cfraudulent overpayment.\u201d Helping to broker the exit deal in 2018 from Mincione\u2019s fund was another financier, Gianluigi Torzi, who was also convicted at the Vatican trial last December. He was found to have structured a deal which left him in control of the building and the Vatican purchasing an\u00a0\u201cempty box\u201d. Torzi was then accused of extorting around $16 million from the Vatican as Pe\u00f1a Parra and his office sought to finally gain control of the Chelsea building. The property was eventually sold by the Holy See in 2022 for around $229 million. Under cross-examination the archbishop was questioned repeatedly about the Torzi payments and was accused by Mincione\u2019s barrister of dishonesty because the payments to Torzi involved a false invoice. The archbishop admitted to sending a false invoice but said Torzi had \u201ctrapped\u201d the Vatican and would \u201clie and lie.\u201d Pe\u00f1a Parra told the judge repeatedly that he had been trying to extricate the Holy See from a bad deal and gain control of the building. The archbishop, who became the Vatican number three in October 2018, said he only became aware of Torzi\u2019s schemes later and that some of his staff were \u201csuperficial and na\u00efve.\u201d He insisted that now \u201cI would give Torzi nothing, and I would put him in jail several times.\u201d Mincione\u2019s lawyers have accused the Vatican of an \u201cincoherent and confused allegation of conspiracy\u201d against their client, while the Holy See insist that Mincione did not act in good faith. Mincione was also cross examined during the trial, with lawyers accusing him of producing \u201cgrossly misleading\u201d figures about the Chelsea property\u2019s value. The heart of the dispute concerns the value of the Chelsea property. The Vatican\u2019s legal team said the stated value of \u00a3275 million ($350 million) for the London property in 2018 was a \u201cfraudulent representation\u201d of its market worth, while Mincione\u2019s lawyers denied this, saying it was an \u201caudited valuation.\u201d In his witness statement, Pe\u00f1a Parra said he was told of \u201cconcerns\u201d that the value of the building was less than the Vatican had \u201coriginally thought.\u201d The trial is expected to conclude later this month with a judgment likely to be released later in the year. The archbishop is due to conclude giving evidence on Monday.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/europe/popes-chief-of-staff-london-property-trial-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "world"}}

The organization, founded by 2011 CNN Hero Yuval Roth, had grown to 1,300 volunteers and was helping about 140 patients a day before the war. On October 7, during Hamas\u2019 brutal attacks on Israel, several of the group\u2019s volunteers were killed. Others were taken hostage. Today, Road to Recovery\u2019s work continues, and Roth feels that it is as crucial as ever. \u201cWe \u2026 believe that patient transportation has far greater value than just humanitarian assistance,\u201d Roth said. \u201cIt is an opportunity for us to show our Palestinian neighbors a different face than what they know in their reality. It is a chance for encounters that break down barriers and stigmas.\u201d On October 8, volunteers were waiting at checkpoints at the West Bank to pick up Palestinian patients and their families. The organization currently transports between 40 to 50 patients a day between the checkpoints and Israeli hospitals and medical providers. Roth started this work in 2006 as a way to cope with personal tragedy. In 1993, his brother Udi was kidnapped and killed by members of Hamas. After his loss, Roth channeled his anger into peace. The organization says it has since provided transportation to more than 50,000 sick Palestinians. \u201cEach trip is an opportunity to make a \u2018small hour of peace.\u2019\u201d Roth said. \u201cEspecially now, just to show compassion and love. \u2026 This is the medicine for the hostility and for the hateness.\u201d Sometimes, the Israeli volunteer drivers and Palestinian passengers are able to communicate in Arabic, Hebrew, or English. When there\u2019s no shared spoken language, they communicate through gestures, which Roth finds to be more powerful than words. \u201cIf we really want one day normal life for us and for the Palestinians, we should make effort to achieve it,\u201d Roth said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just that you sit and you wait that something will happen.

Nearly 70 million people are under heat alerts Sunday, after over three dozen high-temperature records were either set or tied on Saturday, according to the National Weather Service. Highs in the upper 90s to 110s are expected up and down the West Coast and parts of the Great Basin. \u201cIn the West, intense widespread dangerous heat will continue through early next week,\u201d the weather service said. \u201cAll-time heat records may be possible in a few locations.\u201d By Wednesday, over 250 warm high and low temperature records could be set. And nearly 40 million people in the contiguous US are forecast to see temperatures over 100 degrees over the next seven days. A slew of daily temperature records were broken this Fourth of July weekend. On Saturday, Death Valley reached 128 degrees, breaking the daily record of 127 set on July 6, 2007. Las Vegas reached 115 degrees, tying with records in 2007 and 1989. Kingman, Arizona, reached 109 degrees, breaking the previous record of 108. On Sunday, temperatures in Las Vegas hit 120 degrees for the first time in recorded history, according to preliminary data from the weather service.\u00a0In more than 32,000 days of records, the temperature had never climbed above 117 degrees prior to Sunday. The city\u2019s heat is not just a record for its peak temperature, but also for its longevity. Las Vegas temperatures have exceeded 110 degrees each day since July 3 and are forecast to do so every day until at least next Sunday. That will mark a stretch of prolonged extreme heat longer than any ever experienced in the city, with 11 days or more above 110 degrees. In California, Daggett broke its daily temperature record, reaching 117 degrees. Bishop reached 108 degrees, setting another record for the state. Several record highs were also set in the Sacramento area, including in Redding, where it reached 119 degrees and beat the all-time high temperature record of 118, according to the weather service in Sacramento. Extremely dangerous heat is expected to persist in the West, with excessive heat watches, warnings and heat advisories in effect for much of the region. Heat warnings are active in California and Nevada due to the increased risk of heat-related illnesses there. \u201cIntense, widespread, and long duration heat building in the West will be extremely dangerous and potentially deadly if not taken seriously,\u201d the weather service said. An excessive heat warning is in effect until late Wednesday evening for Death Valley, California, where temperatures are expected to be between 122 to 129 degrees. Elsewhere in the state, Owens Valley could reach 111 degrees, and Barstow could reach 118. In Nevada, Las Vegas and Pahrump could also reach 118 degrees. \u201cHot temperatures overnight will mean little relief from the daytime heat, especially in Las Vegas and Death Valley, where low temperatures may not fall below 90 degrees for several days,\u201d the National Weather Service said. Death Valley \u2013 the driest national park in the US \u2013 could hit a sizzling 130 degrees by Tuesday, according to the National Weather Service in Las Vegas. For people without adequate cooling and hydration, the multi-day nature of the heat and record warm overnight temperatures could cause heat stress to build. Extreme heat\u00a0is one of the leading weather-related killers in the United States, leaving hundreds of people dead each year, according to the\u00a0weather service. Oregon and Washington have both also seen record heat and temperatures are expected to remain in the triple digits through early next week. \u201cLook for more records to fall in the coming days as temperatures in the inland valleys are likely to climb near or above 100 degrees each day through Tuesday, July 9,\u201d the weather service in Portland said. Meanwhile, heat and humidity in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast is forecast to gradually subside into next week, lingering longest along the Gulf Coast and into the Carolinas, the weather service said. Heat index values approaching 110 degrees on Saturday in the mid-Atlantic region will be lowered to near 100 degrees on Sunday. Heat advisories currently stretch from upstate New York down the East Coast to Alabama. In the West, the heat wave is expected to expand into the Great Basin and eventually the northern High Plains into next week. It\u2019s likely to remain into mid-July, according to the weather service. Wildfire threat is fueled by unrelenting heat Intense heat, paired with dry windy conditions, is bringing a critical risk of wildfires to parts of the upper Great Basin toward the Four Corners for the rest of the weekend. Portions of southern Idaho and southern Utah are particularly at risk. Sweltering heat on the West Coast could continue to fuel large wildfires in California. More than 3,000 wildfires across the state have burned over 150,000 acres so far in 2024, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.   Cal Fire spokesperson Nick Schuler says triple-digit temperatures and critical fire weather conditions have proven to be a challenge for\u00a0the more than 3,500\u00a0firefighters battling fires across the state. \u201cChallenges are immense. We\u2019re dealing with the increased temperatures, very steep and remote terrain,\u201d Schuler told CNN\u2019s Fredricka Whitfield, adding \u201cthe ability for rapid growth from the amount of vegetation that\u2019s across the state is a challenge.\u201d The Basin Fire, which is the largest active wildfire in the state, burned over 14,000 acres in Fresno County and was 60% contained Saturday evening, according to the Cal Fire. Another large wildfire, the Lake Fire, ignited Friday afternoon in Santa Barbara County and has already scorched over 13,200 acres. The Santa Barbara Sheriff\u2019s Office issued evacuation warnings in nearby areas and several roads were closed. The Thompson Fire, for which California Gov. Gavin Newsom had issued an emergency declaration, was 79% contained as of Saturday night. After starting Tuesday, it has burned through nearly 4,000 acres in Butte County. Two firefighters were injured, 26 structures were destroyed and eight were damaged by the fire, according to Cal Fire. \u201cDangerously hot and dry conditions were observed across the incident,\u201d according to Cal Fire. The French Fire in Mariposa County was 35% contained and had burned through over 900 acres after it started on the fourth of July. Due to the fire, evacuation orders and warnings were issued, four firefighters were injured and four structures were destroyed, according to Cal Fire. Meanwhile, the Mccain Fire in San Diego County had burned about 1,500 acres and was 95% contained. \u201cWe are happy to report that we are seeing an increase in the percentage of containment,\u201d Schuler said. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to lift some of the evacuation orders and warnings allowing people to start to cautiously make way back to their homes.\u201d But\u00a0crews still have to contend with\u00a0several\u00a0days\u00a0ahead\u00a0of\u00a0continued\u00a0heat, Schuler said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/07/weather/west-coast-heat-wave-california-nevada-oregon/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_03_tech_google-ai-greenhouse-gas-emissions-environmental-impact", "text": "As Google has rushed to incorporate artificial intelligence into its core products \u2014 with sometimes less-than-stellar results \u2014 a problem has been brewing behind the scenes: the systems needed to power its AI tools have vastly increased the company\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. AI systems need lots of computers to make them work. The data centers needed to run them, essentially warehouses full of powerful computing equipment, suck up tons of energy to process data and manage the heat all of those computers produce. The end result has been that Google\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions have soared 48% since 2019, according to the tech giant\u2019s annual environment report. The tech giant blamed that growth mainly on \u201cincreased data center energy consumption and supply chain emissions.\u201d Now, Google is calling its goal to reach net-zero emissions by 2030 \u201cextremely ambitious,\u201d and said the pledge is likely to be affected by \u201cthe uncertainty around the future environmental impact of AI, which is complex and difficult to predict.\u201d In other words: a sustainability push by the company \u2014 which once included the slogan \u201cdon\u2019t be evil\u201d in its code of conduct \u2014 has gotten more complicated thanks to AI. Google, like other tech rivals, has gone all-in on investing in AI, which is widely seen as the next major tech revolution that\u2019s poised to change how we live, work and consume information. The company has integrated its Gemini generative AI technology into some of its core products, including Search and Google Assistant, and CEO Sundar Pichai has called Google an \u201cAI-first company.\u201d But AI comes with a major downside: the power-hungry data centers that Google and other Big Tech rivals are currently spending tens of billions of dollars each quarter to expand in order to fuel their AI ambitions. Illustrating just how much more demanding AI models are than traditional computing systems, the International Energy Agency estimates that a Google search query requires 0.3 watt-hours of electricity on average, while a ChatGPT request typically consumes about 2.9 watt-hours. An October\u00a0study\u00a0from Dutch researcher Alex de Vries estimated that the \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d suggests Google\u2019s AI systems could eventually consume as much electricity as the country of Ireland each year, assuming a full-scale adoption of AI in their current hardware and software. \u201cAs we further integrate AI into our products, reducing emissions may be challenging due to increasing energy demands from the greater intensity of AI compute, and the emissions associated with the expected increases in our technical infrastructure investment,\u201d Google said in its report, published Monday. It added that data center electricity consumption is currently growing faster than it can bring carbon-free electricity sources online. Google said it expects its total greenhouse gas emissions to continue to rise before falling, as the company seeks to invest in clean energy sources, such as wind and geothermal energy, to power its data centers. The large amounts of water used as coolant needed to prevent data centers from overheating also presents a sustainability challenge. Google says it aims to replenish 120% of the freshwater it consumes in its offices and data centers by 2030; last year, it replenished just 18% of that water, although the amount was up sharply from 6% the year prior. Google is also among companies experimenting with ways to use AI to fight climate change. A 2019 Google DeepMind project, for example, trained an AI model on weather forecasts and historical wind turbine data to predict the availability of wind power, helping to increase the value of the renewable energy source for wind farmers. The company has also used AI to suggest more fuel-efficient routes to drivers using Google Maps. \u201cWe know that scaling AI and using it to accelerate climate action is just as crucial as addressing the environmental impact associated with it,\u201d Google said in the report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/tech/google-ai-greenhouse-gas-emissions-environmental-impact/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_09_middleeast_gaza-famine-un-report-intl-latam", "text": "The recent deaths of more Palestinian children due to hunger and malnutrition in the Gaza Strip indicates\u00a0that famine\u00a0has spread across the entire enclave, according to a United Nations statement, citing independent experts. An estimated 495,000 people in Gaza \u2013 or 22% of the population \u2013 are \u201cexperiencing an extreme lack of food,\u201d according to an Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) report last month. Under the IPC system \u2013\u00a0a five-phase scale used as a common standard for classifying the severity of food insecurity \u2013 a famine can only be declared if data shows certain thresholds are met. In the UN statement, published Tuesday, the group of experts said: \u201cIsrael\u2019s intentional and targeted starvation campaign against the Palestinian people is a form of genocidal violence and has resulted in famine across all of Gaza. \u201cWe call upon the international community to prioritise the delivery of humanitarian aid by land by any means necessary, end Israel\u2019s siege, and establish a ceasefire,\u201d they continued. The experts said that deaths of children from a lack of food and water indicate that health and social structures have been critically weakened. \u201cWhen the first child dies from malnutrition and dehydration, it becomes irrefutable that\u00a0famine\u00a0has taken hold,\u201d the experts added. The statement cited the deaths of three Palestinian children \u2014 6-month-old Fayez Ataya, 13-year-old Abdulqader Al-Serhi\u00a0and 9-year-old Ahmad Abu Reida. It said they died from malnutrition and lack of access to adequate healthcare in late May and early June. The experts emphasized that these children had died from starvation\u00a0despite medical treatment in central Gaza, indicating\u00a0that\u00a0famine\u00a0has now spread from northern Gaza into central and southern regions. CNN has reached out to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and Israeli Prime Minister\u2019s Office (PMO) for comment. Israel\u2019s permanent mission to the UN in Geneva dismissed the statement, alleging the experts were \u201cspreading misinformation\u201d and \u201csupporting Hamas propaganda.\u201d In June, the IPC reported a deterioration in the humanitarian situation following the launch of Israel\u2019s military operations in Rafah. The Rafah crossing \u2013 a crucial route for humanitarian aid to Gaza \u2013 has been closed since early May. Meanwhile, a much-lauded but ultimately troubled US military pier set up off the Gazan coast will be permanently removed soon, according to US officials. The $230 temporary pier operation \u2013 intended as an alternative aid distribution option to land routes \u2013 based at the Israeli port of Ashdod has faced many challenges since it began operation in mid-May. Last month it was disconnected from Gaza due to inclement weather, but will be reconnected one final time to deliver any remaining aid from Cyprus and from a floating dock that is moored several miles off shore. More than 19.4 million pounds of aid have been delivered via the pier to the collection area in Gaza since it started operations. Humanitarian aid workers continue to face tremendous risks while trying to distribute desperately needed aid to Gaza, the UN said. The majority of the infrastructure supporting humanitarian work in Gaza has been destroyed in Israel\u2019s conflict with Hamas, according to the same report. ActionAid, an international campaign group, described the UN experts\u2019 statement as a \u201cstark warning.\u201d \u201cThis is a stain on humanity\u2019s conscience\u00a0and an entirely preventable, human-made crisis. The world cannot sit back and watch any more children die from lack of food: more life-saving aid must be allowed into Gaza immediately,\u201d the group said in a Wednesday statement. \u201cWe call on all states to use every diplomatic lever available to them to bring about a permanent ceasefire, now.\u201d Israel\u2019s war in Gaza has depleted the territory\u2019s health system, leaving staff unable to treat malnourished children. Doctors previously told CNN they are being forced to turn away parents begging for baby milk, unable to even triage young patients with chronic illnesses compounded by severe hunger. And as Israel continues its siege\u00a0on Gaza,\u00a0preventing aid groups getting enough food into the enclave, parents say they have no choice but to watch their children starve to death. At least 34 children have already died of malnutrition in Gaza, the government media office reported on June 22. The true number could be higher, as limited access to the strip has impeded aid agencies\u2019 efforts to fully assess the crisis there.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/middleeast/gaza-famine-un-report-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "world"}}

The Taliban\u2019s so-called morality police have curtailed human rights \u2013 disproportionately targeting women and girls \u2013 creating a \u201cclimate of fear and intimidation,\u201d said the report by the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) published Tuesday. The Ministry of the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice (MPVPV), established by the Taliban when it seized power in 2021, is charged with legislating and enforcing the Taliban\u2019s strict interpretations of Islamic law. Those interpretations include a ban on activities deemed to be \u201cun-Islamic\u201d including displaying images of humans and animals and celebrating Valentine\u2019s Day. Moreover, the report said, the Taliban\u2019s instructions are issued in a variety of formats \u2013 often only verbally \u2013 and are inconsistently and unpredictably enforced. When the Taliban returned to power in Afghanistan in August 2021 in a\u00a0lightning takeover\u00a0following the chaotic withdrawal of US-led troops after two decades of war, the radical Islamist group appeared keen to distance itself from its earlier period of rule in the 1990s, presenting itself as more moderate. However, this report found many of the same rules of that era have been revived, despite the Taliban\u2019s earlier pledge to honor women\u2019s rights within the norms of \u201cIslamic law.\u201d Between August 15, 2021, and March 31, 2024, the UN documented at least 1,033 instances where Taliban officers had used violence to enforce their rules. \u201cThe de facto MPVPV reportedly has a broad mandate and various enforcement methods have been used, including verbal intimidation, arrests and detentions, ill treatment and public lashing,\u201d said the report, which was compiled using public announcements and documented reports of human rights violations. The Taliban\u2019s violations against women and girls are so severe that one senior UN official recently said they could amount to \u201ccrimes against humanity.\u201d This report details how the MPVPV is enforcing rules on the way women dress and access public places. The Taliban has arbitrarily shuttered women-owned businesses, made it illegal for women to appear in movies, closed women\u2019s beauty salons and restricted access to birth control, the UN report said. Women in Afghanistan are not allowed to access parks, gyms and public baths \u2013 sometimes the only way to get hot water in the winter \u2013 and must be accompanied by a male guardian (a mahram) when traveling more than 78 kilometers (48.5 miles) from their homes, according to the report. While women must wear a hijab, men must also follow rules about beard length and hairstyles. In December 2023, the morality police closed 20 barbershops for one night after barbers allegedly shaved and trimmed beards, as well as Western-style haircuts, the report said. The Taliban denied claims two barbers were detained for two nights. The report said they were only released after promising not to give those haircuts again. UN says Taliban is legally obligated to protect human rights Afghanistan is party to seven international human rights instruments and as a result is legally obliged to protect and promote the human rights of its citizens, the UN report pointed out. These rules violate a slew of human rights, from the right to work and attain a living, to the rights of freedom of movement and expression, to sexual and reproductive rights, the report added. In a statement, the Taliban called the UN\u2019s criticism \u201cunfounded\u201d and said the report\u2019s authors were \u201cattempting to evaluate Afghanistan from a Western perspective, which is incorrect.\u201d \u201cAfghanistan should be assessed as a Muslim society, where the vast majority of the population are Muslims who have made significant sacrifices for the establishment of a Sharia system,\u201d the statement said. However, reports from Afghanistan suggest the Taliban\u2019s repressive control over women has led to a sharp rise in suicide attempts. CNN interviewed a 16-year-old girl who drank battery acid to escape life under the Taliban, saying she was \u201coverwhelmed by hopelessness\u201d after spending months at home due to a ban on girls in secondary education. Among the Taliban\u2019s list of prohibitions, according to the report, is the public display of human and animal images, which it deems \u201cun-Islamic.\u201d This law has resulted in the removal of advertising signage and the covering of shop mannequins, the report said. The UN reported some cases where NGOs were told to remove human images from materials meant to alert children or other people with limited literacy about the risk of unexploded artillery and other public health issues. Media is heavily restricted, and residents live in a surveillance state, the report added. \u201cPeople\u2019s right to privacy is violated through searches for prohibited items in their phone or cars, having their attendance at mosques recorded, or being required to show proof of family relationship in public places.\u201d The Taliban met with top UN officials and global envoys in Qatar in June in a two-day conference that excluded Afghan women, sparking outcry from human rights groups. In a press conference after the meeting, Rosemary DiCarlo, the UN\u2019s under-secretary-general for political and peacebuilding affairs, called the discussions \u201cfrank\u201d and \u201cuseful,\u201d and said that the \u201cconcerns and views of Afghan women and civil society were front and center.\u201d This was the third UN meeting about Afghanistan in Doha, but the first the Taliban has attended.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/10/asia/afghanistan-taliban-life-un-report-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_09_middleeast_gaza-city-idf-israel-evacuation-intl-latam", "text": "Yet again, tens of thousands of people in Gaza are on the move, as the Israeli military issues fresh evacuation orders for a number of areas in Gaza City. Over the past 10 days, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has issued instructions for hundreds of thousands of people in Khan Younis in the south, Shujaya in central Gaza and\u00a0the several neighborhoods of Gaza City to leave. The effect has been to increase the total number of displaced people in Gaza, from 1.7 million in May to an estimated 1.9 million now, according to the UN. Approximately nine out of 10 people in Gaza are now estimated to be internally displaced, many of them multiple times. \u201cMass displacement has been predominantly driven by evacuation orders issued by the Israeli military, extensive destruction of both private and public infrastructure, restricted access to essential services, and the persistent fear of ongoing hostilities,\u201d according to the most recent assessment by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). It\u2019s unclear how many people in Gaza City have heeded the latest evacuation order. Many civilians are wary of leaving whatever shelter they have for an uncertain journey to an even more uncertain fate living on the streets or in the overcrowded, unsanitary tent villages that pop up with each evacuation order. The IDF has said that evacuation orders are necessary so that civilians don\u2019t get caught up in its renewed operations in areas where Hamas is seeking to re-establish a presence. The IDF insists it goes to great lengths to avoid civilian casualties. Hamas has said the evacuations threaten to return negotiations for a ceasefire and hostage deal to \u201cpoint zero.\u201d Khader Al Za\u2019anoun, a journalist with Wafa, the official Palestinian news agency, told CNN that late on Sunday people in the Tuffah, Old City and Daraj neighborhoods had been instructed to move to \u201cknown shelters in the west of Gaza City.\u201d But he said the large-scale evacuation came amid drone- and air-strikes. \u201cIt was terrifying, people were running, some were in wheelchairs, everyone in panic not knowing where to go. The heavy bombardments were close, and the smoke was filling the skies,\u201d Al Za\u2019anoun told CNN after reaching the port area. A journey full of danger The strikes continued all night, along with repeated gunfire in areas where people were sheltering. \u201cI decided to wait until the morning and not move due to the dangerous situation,\u201d Al Za\u2019anoun said. But at dawn airstrikes targeted a high-rise building close to where he and his family and many other displaced people were taking shelter. \u201cAt that moment, to protect the lives of my family, I decided to leave the place and evacuate to the port area in the west of the city in a journey full of danger.\u201d Al Za\u2019anoun send photographs of his family walking through ruined streets as he dragged a pushchair with their remaining possessions. The IDF confirmed to CNN that the evacuation order for parts of Gaza City was the third in the past 10 days. OCHA estimates that about 80,000 people were living in the Shujaya area when the order to evacuate came on June 27. A further 250,000 people living in eastern Khan Younis and Rafah were placed under an evacuation order by the Israeli authorities on July 1. On that day, the IDF said that people in 71 residential blocs in eastern Khan Younis and Rafah must immediately evacuate westwards to what it defines as a \u201chumanitarian zone\u201d in Al Mawasi. OCHA said the area included medical points, primary health centers and 14 field kitchens, as well as a sewage treatment center. It said the internally displaced \u201cmoved toward western Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah, which are already overcrowded and lack basic services, critical infrastructure, shelter materials and spaces to accommodate the new influx of IDPs.\u201d No patients, no equipment, no longer functional OCHA and other agencies say the evacuation orders have had a major impact on the few operational hospitals in Gaza. On July 2, the Israeli authorities clarified that the European Hospital in Khan Younis was not included in the evacuation order. It was too late. Most medical staff and patients had left. A UN staffer \u2013 Jonathan Whittall \u2013 reported from the hospital: \u201cThere are no patients, there\u2019s no equipment, and it\u2019s no longer functional.\u201d The director general of the World Health Organization, Tedros Ghebreyesus, said on X it was \u201cdevastating to see the 650-bed-capacity hospital out of service at a time when access to health care is urgently needed.\u201d The International Red Cross team at the hospital \u2013 which has carried out more than 3,000 surgeries there since the conflict began \u2013 also left. Many of those who left the European hospital crowded into the nearby Nasser Medical Complex, which reached full capacity. The WHO and other agencies were able to move much of the equipment from the European Hospital to Nasser, including ventilators and anaesthesia machines.\u00a0But medical staff were left wondering if and when they would have to move yet again. Now, one of the main hospitals in Gaza City \u2013 the Al Ahli Baptist \u2013 has also closed its doors. The Episcopal Church in Jerusalem, which runs Al Ahli, said that after several drone strikes in the immediate area on Sunday, the hospital was included in the \u201cred zone\u201d for evacuation. \u201cAs a result,\u201d the church said on Facebook on Monday, \u201call vulnerable people sheltering in the grounds, the staff and all patients had to leave the safety of the grounds \u2026 Our hospital is now out of operation at a time when its services are in very significant demand.\u201d Archbishop Hosam Naoum said the diocese protested the closure in the strongest possible terms and appealed to Israeli authorities to allow it to reopen. CNN has reached out to the IDF for an update on the hospital\u2019s status. OCHA said that \u201cAt present, only 15 of Gaza\u2019s 36 hospitals remain functional, albeit partially, and most are only partially accessible to patients.\u201d After the latest evacuation order, CNN filmed in the main route out of Gaza City \u2013 al-Rasheed street \u2013 toward what the IDF has described as \u201csafe areas.\u201d It was virtually empty. A CNN stringer in Gaza City, himself now displaced, said that many people had taken backstreets for fear of being targeted on the main road. Saleh was one young man who was trying to go in the opposite direction, into Gaza City, describing himself as \u201cfed up with this war, fed up with everything.\u201d But he and a few others with him encountered Israeli tanks and infantry. \u201cWe ran away from them, but there was a sniper who started shooting at us. The soldiers dismounted from the tank, and we kept running while the tanks pursued us.\u201d Saleh received a gunshot wound to the stomach but escaped to the coast where he said he took cover until the tanks left the area. \u2018What are we going to eat today?\u2019 Besides the obvious dangers in moving from one part of Gaza to another, the constant displacements make it harder for aid agencies to target the provision of food. The World Food Programme said Monday that\u00a0\u201calmost half a million people in\u00a0Gaza\u00a0face catastrophic levels of hunger. Due to unreliable access and limited stocks, families often don\u2019t receive the full rations and frequency they need.\u201d OCHA said that the evacuation orders complicate the logistical challenge of distributing aid. It said that between July 1 and 4, only one of 13 planned humanitarian assistance missions coordinated with the Israeli authorities to northern Gaza was facilitated, with the others impeded or cancelled. The situation in the south was better, with 43 out of 55 missions facilitated by the Israeli authorities. The Norwegian Refugee Council says that as people fled Khan Younis last week many spent the first night sleeping in the open, next to their belongings. \u201cOthers walked very long distances, carrying their children and anything they could bring with them,\u201d said\u00a0Maysa Saleh, an NRC Education Officer in Deir al-Balah. \u201cEverything is tightening around them \u2026 the first question every morning is the same: what are we going to eat today?\u201d \u201cTents have also virtually run out,\u201d Saleh said. \u201cThe other day, I saw a\u00a0tent\u00a0made out of empty fabric rice sacks sewn together.\u201d \u201cThere are so many children scattered around the streets, you walk around and see children living there because that\u2019s their home now.\u201d The NRC echoes OCHA\u2019s estimate that some 250,000 people have fled Khan Younis \u201cmainly to overcrowded western areas and Deir al-Balah.\u201d It said evacuation orders \u201clack assurances of safety, adequate accommodation, or return once hostilities end for those forced to relocate.\u201d UNRWA\u2019s senior communications officer Louise Wateridge described her journey through Khan Younis on Monday in a post on X. \u201cMakeshift shelters as far as you can see, families collecting water, children searching through trash for things to eat, sell or burn to cook on,\u201d she wrote.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/middleeast/gaza-city-idf-israel-evacuation-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_06_americas_argentina-lgbtq-milei-fire-deaths-intl-latam", "text": "It was an attack that sent shockwaves through a country long considered a pioneer in LGBTQ rights. In the early hours of May 6, four lesbian women were set on fire\u00a0in Argentina. Only one of them survived. It happened at a\u00a0boarding house\u00a0in the Barracas neighborhood of Buenos Aires, where Pamela Fabiana Cobas, Mercedes Roxana Figueroa, Andrea Amarante and Sof\u00eda Castro Riglo were sharing a room. Witnesses say a man\u00a0broke in\u00a0and threw an incendiary device that set the women on fire. Pamela died soon after. Her partner Roxana died days later of organ failure. Andrea died on May 12 in a hospital. Andrea\u2019s\u00a0partner Sof\u00eda was the sole survivor. She spent weeks recovering in hospital and is alive today only because Andrea threw herself on top of her to shield her from the flames, Sofia\u2019s attorney Gabriela Conder told CNN. \u201cHer partner saved her,\u201d Conder said. Local LGBTQ rights advocates condemned the attack as a hate crime and lesbicide, saying the women were targeted because of their sexual identity. Police have arrested a 62-year-old man who\u00a0lived in the building but, according to Conder, aren\u2019t currently treating the incident as a hate crime as they say the motive is still unclear. For Argentina\u2019s LGBTQ groups \u2013 many of whom are planning to commemorate the four women with a rally this weekend \u2013 the attack represents an extreme manifestation of what they consider a growing wave of hostility against them. Those they blame most for this rising intolerance are the people in power. Chief among them, they say, is the country\u2019s new far-right leader Javier Milei. \u201cThings changed with the new government of Javier Milei,\u201d said Maria Rachid, head of the Institute Against Discrimination of the Ombudsman\u2019s Office in Buenos Aires, and a board member and founder of the Argentine LGBT Federation (FALGBT). \u201cSince the beginning of the new government, there are national government officials expressing themselves in a discriminatory manner and those hate speeches before our communities from places with so much power, of course, what they do is generate \u2013 actually legitimize \u2013 and endorse these discriminatory positions that are then expressed with violence and discrimination in everyday life,\u201d Rachid said. Milei under fire When Milei ran for president\u00a0in 2023, he and his party\u00a0were accused of making offensive remarks against LGBTQ communities which were deemed hate speech by multiple groups, including Argentina\u2019s National Observatory of LGBTQ Hate Crimes. In a YouTube interview ahead of the November election, Milei insisted that he does\u00a0not oppose same-sex marriage, but in that same interview, he went on to compare homosexuality to having sex with animals. \u201cWhat do I care what your sexual preference is? If you want to be with an elephant, and you have the consent of that elephant, that\u2019s a problem between you and the elephant,\u201d he said, angering LGBTQ communities, who called the comments dehumanizing. In late October, then-congresswoman-elect Diana Mondino, who would later become Milei\u2019s foreign minister, told an interviewer that she supports marriage equality in theory, but at the same time,\u00a0compared it to having lice. \u201cAs a\u00a0liberal, I\u2019m in favor of each person\u2019s life project. It is much broader than marriage equality. Let me exaggerate: If you prefer not to bathe and be full of lice and it is your choice, that\u2019s it. Don\u2019t complain later if there is someone who doesn\u2019t like that you have lice,\u201d she said. After\u00a0taking office in December, Milei took steps that\u00a0critics say weakened protections for LGBTQ groups. He banned\u00a0the use of\u00a0gender-inclusive language\u00a0in government; replaced the\u00a0Ministry of Women, Gender and Diversity\u00a0with a less powerful undersecretariat within the Ministry of Human Capital; and effectively closed the national anti-discrimination agency, saying the Ministry of Justice would\u00a0absorb its functions. Milei\u2019s administration argued that some of those moves were part of his plan to cut public spending in response to the country\u2019s economic hardships. But critics say his actions have normalized a culture of discrimination toward LGBTQ groups, and in the most extreme cases, have led to violent attacks such as the deadly May 6 arson. \u201cWhen hate speech is enabled by those in power, these sectors start to feel legitimized to attack,\u201d Esteban Paul\u00f3n, a former FALGBT president who was elected to Congress last year, told CNN in a phone interview. \u201cAnd obviously, behind the verbal attacks come physical attacks.\u201d \u201c(Attacks) always happened. That\u2019s the reality. But they increased more in this current government due to the hate speeches constantly maintained on television, including hate speeches that our president Javier Milei exerts,\u201d said Jesi Hern\u00e1ndez, a lesbian and communication member of Lesbianxs Autoconvocadxs por la masacre de Barracas (Self-convened Lesbians for the Barracas massacre). \u201cToday it was Pamela, Roxana, Andrea and Sof\u00eda. And tomorrow it can be me.\u201d CNN\u00a0has repeatedly reached out to the presidency for comment on these allegations but has not received a response. Rise in hate crimes In 2023, an annual report by the National Observatory of LGBTQ Hate Crimes recorded\u00a0133 crimes\u00a0in which the victims\u2019 sexual orientation, identity and/or gender expression were used as a pretext for the attacks. Those numbers rose from 2022 and 2021, when 129 and 120 crimes were recorded, respectively. Rachid points out that the observatory\u2019s numbers only represent attacks that have been officially recorded, and that the real figures are likely much higher. Hern\u00e1ndez, meanwhile, notes that daily life for many people has been impacted in ways not shown by statistics alone. Some now fear they could be targeted next. \u201cThe\u00a0truth is that now, sleeping peacefully in your bed is a privilege,\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez said, referencing the May 6 attack, \u201cbecause you don\u2019t know if you have a neighbor who will throw something at you or come in. Sleeping is now a privilege for us.\u201d Despite calls from LGBTQ activists, the arson is currently being investigated as an aggravated homicide rather than a hate crime, according to Conder, Sofia\u2019s attorney. Sofia is set to testify at the end of the month, Conder\u00a0said. CNN has reached out to the criminal court investigating the case but has not received a response. Shortly after the May 6 killings, the presidential spokesperson Manuel Adorni condemned the attack but\u00a0dismissed\u00a0the notion that it was motivated by hatred toward the sexual orientation of the victims. \u201cI don\u2019t like to define it as an attack on a certain group,\u201d Adorni said at a press conference. \u201cThere are many women and men who are suffering violence and these are things that cannot continue to happen.\u201d Progressives condemned his remarks, insisting that the government should regard lesbicide as a hate crime. Adorni responded on social media with a picture of a Spanish dictionary that said\u00a0lesbicide\u00a0is not a registered word. Progress in Argentina Argentina was once a progressive pioneer in\u00a0Latin America. In 2010, it became the first country in the region to\u00a0legalize same-sex marriage. In 2021, it also became the first to allow nonbinary people to mark their gender as \u201cX\u201d on\u00a0national identity documents. LGBTQ activists fear these historic gains are now being undermined \u2013 and potentially threatened \u2013 by the current government.\u00a0But they also take comfort in surveys that suggest anti-LGBTQ views are the minority in Argentina. According to a public opinion survey conducted in May by the University of San Andr\u00e9s, some 72% of respondents said they are in favor of marriage equality, 70% said they support policies that protect transgender people from discrimination, 75% said they do not consider that transsexuality is a disease that should be treated medically, and 79% said that comprehensive sexuality education in schools is a positive thing. The recent attacks have galvanized activists to fight for new policies and actions that would further protect LGBTQ rights. Congressman Paul\u00f3n told CNN that lawmakers are working with rights groups on various laws that would, among other things, punish discriminatory acts, prevent harassment in schools, and ban efforts to try to \u201ccorrect\u201d people\u2019s sexual orientation, identity and gender. He also said that to reduce attacks on LGBTQ communities, their voices and demands should be amplified in more societal sectors. To that end, Hern\u00e1ndez encouraged LGBTQ groups to push back against hate speech, telling those communities: \u201cThey are not insane, they are not sick, they are not people with lice. Quite the opposite. I would tell them that they are a disruptive person, that they are breaking out of the molds of \u2018normality.\u2019 And that they are very brave \u2026 and that they are whatever they want to be, despite all this.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/06/americas/argentina-lgbtq-milei-fire-deaths-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_07_05_uk_uk-election-labour-win-gbr-intl", "text": "The Labour Party has won a landslide victory in the UK general election, sweeping into power after 14 years of Conservative rule on the back of a wave of public disillusionment. Party leader Keir Starmer took over as prime minister on Friday after King Charles III formally asked him to form a new government, with the politician promising the British public he would steer the country towards \u201ccalmer waters.\u201d Starmer, 61, begins his term with what is one of the biggest parliamentary majorities in British history and is expected to introduce a program of far-reaching reforms. Addressing the nation from outside 10 Downing Street for the first time as prime minister, Starmer had one overarching message: Change starts now. \u201cIt is surely clear to everyone that our country needs a bigger reset, a rediscovery of who we are,\u201d he said, cautioning that the national renewal he was promising would take time. \u201cChanging a country is not like flipping a switch, the world is now a more volatile place,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, the Conservative Party recorded the worst result in its history, prompting some commentators to observe that the overall election result was as much about British voters booting out the Conservatives as voting in Labour. The party lost more than 250 of the seats it had held in the 650-seat Parliament since 2019. \u00a0There were high-profile casualties, with the short-lived former Prime Minister Liz Truss and several cabinet ministers being booted out by voters. Conservative leader and, as of Friday morning, former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak took responsibility for the electoral wipeout, apologizing to voters in his farewell address. \u201cI have given this job my all, but you have sent a clear signal that the government of the United Kingdom must change; and yours is the only judgment that matters,\u201d he said on the doorstep of the famous 10 Downing Street residence. Sunak announced he would resign as the leader of the Conservative Party as soon as arrangements were made to find his successor. \u201cI have heard your anger, your disappointment. And I take responsibility for this loss,\u201d he told voters as his wife Akshata Murty stood by. The handover of power is a swift \u2013 and sometimes brutal \u2013 process in the UK, with the outgoing prime minister replaced within hours of losing the election. In keeping with tradition, Sunak left Downing Street for the last time immediately after his speech and was driven the short distance to\u00a0Buckingham Palace to meet the King and hand in his resignation. Having conceded the election in the early hours of Friday, Sunak was out of the job by midday. An hour or so later, election winner Starmer arrived for a brief audience with the King. Leaving the palace as the newly minted prime minister, he then headed straight to Downing Street. The two politicians paid respectful tribute to each other, even though they did not meet in person on Friday. Sunak called his successor \u201ca decent, public-spirited man who I respect\u201d on his way out, while Starmer praised his predecessor\u2019s \u201cdedication and hard work\u201d and highlighted the significance of him being the first British Asian prime minister. Many winners, as many losers While the night was marked by a seismic shift in power from the Conservatives to Labour, other parties scored big wins. The Liberal Democrats went from winning just 11 seats at the 2019 general election to securing more than 70. Traditionally the third-biggest party across the UK, the Lib Dems have in the past struggled to break through and convert their relatively high vote share into parliamentary seats because of the UK\u2019s first-past-the-post electoral system, which favors the biggest parties. Reform UK, the insurgent rightwing populist party, won roughly 14% of the vote but took only five seats in parliament, having split the rightwing vote in many places and further hurt the Conservatives. The grouping is led by Nigel Farage, the face of the Brexit movement and an ally of former US President Donald Trump. Farage himself was elected a member of parliament (MP) for the first time \u2013 after running unsuccessfully seven times in the past. It was a good night too for the Green Party. While the party stood candidates in a record number of constituencies in this election, its official goal was to win four seats - and it succeeded in all four, managing to take two seats from the Conservatives. Meanwhile, the Scottish National Party, or SNP, had a disastrous night, suffering a near total wipeout and ending up with just nine seats, compared to 47 previously. While that defeat might put the push for an independent Scotland on the backburner for now, in Northern Ireland the Irish nationalist Sinn F\u00e9in became the biggest party, overtaking the Democratic Unionist Party, or DUP. Sinn F\u00e9in advocates for a united Ireland and boycotts the UK Parliament, traditionally abstaining from Westminster politics. The DUP, meanwhile, wants a tighter relationship between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Turnout nationwide was low, at just below 60% - only the second time in the past century that more than 40% of voters decided to stay home. And although Labour won by a landslide in terms of seats in parliament, the popular vote showed the party\u2019s win was not a resounding victory. Labour only increased its vote share by a few percentage points from its dismal 2019 showing. Government-building and soul searching Starmer began to form his government on Friday, promising the public he would start working immediately. He appointed Rachel Reeves as the UK\u2019s first female treasury chief and his long-time deputy party leader Angela Rayner as his deputy PM. The new cabinet is expected to mirror Starmer\u2019s former shadow government, although some Labour MPs might see their roles diminished following a poorer than expected showing in their individual constituencies.\u00a0\u00a0Starmer also named David Lammy as Foreign Secretary and Yvette Cooper as Home Secretary. The new prime minister begins his tenure with a strong personal mandate. The huge Labour victory is seen by many as his personal success. His rise to the top job caps what has been a remarkable, and swift, transformation of the Labour Party since the last general election in 2019, when it suffered its worst loss in a generation under its former hard-left leader, Jeremy Corbyn, who, in another twist was re-elected as an independent after being expelled from Labour. Starmer has moved the party back toward the center, promising sustainable public finances, no increases in income taxes and a green agenda. Labour\u2019s tally ended up just shy of the record-breaking majority secured by Tony Blair in 1997. The party\u2019s stance on the war in Gaza may have been a factor, as might weeks of opinion polls predicting a massive Labour win, which may have impacted turnout. Several pro-Palestinian independent candidates took seats that were expected to fall into Labour hands. Starmer \u2013 a former human rights lawyer \u2013 said shortly after the October 7 attacks by Hamas that Israel \u201chas the right\u201d to withhold power and water from Palestinian civilians in Gaza, but added: \u201cObviously, everything should be done within international law.\u201d The party has since become increasingly critical of Israel\u2019s conduct in Gaza and now supports a ceasefire, along with the return of hostages held by Hamas. Meanwhile, the Tories, as the Conservatives are often referred to in the UK, must now endeavor to figure out where it all went so terribly wrong. The party has likely paid a price for what are widely seen as years of chaos and a worsening standard of living under its watch. A notable trigger for that turmoil was the decision by the then Prime Minister David Cameron to call a referendum on Britain\u2019s membership of the European Union. What started out as Cameron\u2019s attempt to shut down the Euroskeptic opposition within his own party brought on years of uncertainty and infighting followed by Brexit \u2013 while many voters still support the country\u2019s departure from the EU, it has caused Britons to be worse off than they used to be. The Brexit debacle was followed by the Covid-19 pandemic. Its handling in Britain was marked by a series of scandals involving top government officials, including Sunak and former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who were fined for breaching the same rules they had imposed on citizens. A cost-of-living crisis that hit much of Europe and the United States, exacerbated by energy prices sent soaring by the war in Ukraine, was made worse in the UK by the Truss government\u2019s disastrous tax-cutting gamble, which caused a political and economic meltdown and sent the cost of borrowing skyrocketing. But with turnout plunging to the lowest level in decades, one thing is certain: like elsewhere in the world, many people in the United Kingdom have become disillusioned with politics, losing their hope for a better future. It will be up to Keir Starmer to convince them otherwise \u2013 a tough job given the sluggish economy, war in Ukraine and the Middle East and the unfolding climate crisis.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/uk/uk-election-labour-win-gbr-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_09_middleeast_iranian-warship-sahand-capsizes-intl-hnk-ml", "text": "One of Iran\u2019s newest warships capsized in port over the weekend while undergoing repairs, an incident that could damage key warfighting systems and put the ship out of commission for up to half a year, a naval analyst said. The 311-foot-long frigate Sahand was at a dock in the port of Bandar Abbas when it \u201clost its balance\u201d after water leaked into its tanks, according to a report from the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA). A photo from the semi-official Tasnim News Agency showed the warship, with a displacement of about 2,000 tons, resting on its left side in the Bandar Abbas port. The ship, which Tasnim\u00a0said entered service in December 2018, is one of the bigger vessels in Iran\u2019s fleet, equipped with antiship cruise missiles and an electronic warfare system. Naval analyst Carl Schuster, a former US Navy captain, said it would take Iran four to six months to repair the ship once it can be refloated. \u201cSeawater severely damages electronics and gets into everything. So, all electronics will have to be removed and chemically cleaned to remove the salt,\u201d he said. It also affects mechanical parts, which could lead to engine failure if the parts are not thoroughly cleaned, he added. \u201cSalt encrustation destroys piston linings and turbine blades and interferes with combustion so if they take short cuts to get that ship back into service, they will pay a heavy price for doing so,\u201d Schuster said. Ships like the Sahand tend to have a lot of \u201ctop hamper,\u201d weight from electronics and weapons above their center of gravity, Schuster said. If lower fuel tanks are emptied, something prudent during a repair process, the higher up weight should have been removed to keep the ship in balance, he said. \u201cOtherwise, you risk capsizing the ship, particularly if there are high winds,\u201d he said. Capsizing, not sinking Schuster said the photo released by Tasnim suggests the ship rolled over quickly, rather than sinking and settling on the relatively shallow harbor bottom at Bandar Abbas. \u201cIts motion (was) stopped only by the mast and stack encountering the harbor bottom,\u201d he said. Several people sustained minor injuries in the incident and were taken to a hospital, IRNA reported. The Iranian news agency reports said the warship was \u201cbeing returned to balance.\u201d That\u2019s a process likely to take a week or more, according to Schuster, with cranes, floatation bladders and portable pumps needed. The Sahand is the most recent ship to carry that name for the Iranian navy. The previous Sahand was sunk by the US Navy in 1988 during Operation Praying Mantis, which launched after a US frigate was crippled by an Iranian mine in the Persian Gulf.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/middleeast/iranian-warship-sahand-capsizes-intl-hnk-ml/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "travel_tiktok-tap-water-europe-trend", "text": "American Helene Sula vividly remembers the first time she discovered tap water was a different ball game in Europe. Sula, from Texas, was at a restaurant in Germany. When the server asked for her drink order, Sula requested water. \u201cThey kind of scoffed at me like, \u2018You can get water. But why would you?\u2019\u201d Sula recalls. She remembers glancing around and realizing everyone else in the restaurant was enjoying glasses of wine and pints of beer \u2013 no water to be seen. Sula repeated her water order and the server demurred. But, when the water arrived, it wasn\u2019t the giant glass of free tap water, sloshing with ice, Sula was expecting. Instead, she was served a single glass liter bottle of sparkling water, accompanied by a tiny drinking glass and 2 Euro price tag. Sula couldn\u2019t believe it. \u201cIn the US, you sit down at the table and you\u2019re given a huge glass of water with ice and it\u2019s not even a question \u2013 it\u2019s just plopped on the table. No matter if you\u2019re at a fancy restaurant or a casual restaurant, you\u2019re going to get a huge free glass of water,\u201d Sula tells CNN Travel. A few years later, when Sula and her husband relocated to Germany \u2013 the couple observed another water-related cultural difference. Whenever they went out hiking, biking or walking the city, Sula and her husband would pack large water bottles \u2013 sometimes even CamelBaks, a type of water backpack (\u201cSo we can drink water at every possible moment,\u201d Sula explains). Meanwhile their European friends often went without water entirely, holding out until they decamped to a bar that evening \u2013 and even then, they\u2019d usually opt for wine instead. Sula couldn\u2019t believe it. \u201cI just figured, maybe Europeans just don\u2019t get as dehydrated as we do,\u201d says Sula, still audibly baffled after several years living in Europe. Understanding European water habits If you\u2019re thinking: \u201cWait, this is just one person\u2019s opinion and it\u2019s a pretty broad generalization,\u201d you\u2019d be right. After all, there are many different countries within Europe, each with their own culture, dietary habits, traditions and water-drinking habits. And of course the US isn\u2019t a cultural monolith either. Sure, some Americans take pride in their enormous Stanley cups and undertake water-related daily challenges, but others would always opt for soda if given the choice. And while many Americans are conscious of the environmental impact of plastic water bottles, others actively eschew water from the kitchen faucet and keep their fridge stocked with bottled water. Nevertheless, Sula isn\u2019t alone in her observations. US travelers sharing hot takes on European tap water consumption (or lack thereof) has become a bit of a social media trend over the past year or so. Take TikTok user br3nnak3ough, who in summer 2023 uploaded a video depicting her friends downing large bottles of water, overlaid with the text: \u201cUs the moment we can find water because Europeans don\u2019t believe in water.\u201d This video been viewed 10.9 million times and attracted 13,800 comments \u2013 both from Americans in agreement (\u201cI was so dehydrated when I went lol, the heat + lack of ac and water/ice had me dying..\u201d) and Europeans vehemently disagreeing (\u201cWhat are you talking about\u201d) Meanwhile, Rob Murgatroyd, an American living in Italy, recently uploaded a TikTok commenting that the difference between US and Italian water consumption had \u201cblown his mind\u201d since moving to Florence. \u201cWhere I come from, we\u2019re practically wired to drink water non-stop, as if it\u2019s our main gig, while here in Italy, spotting someone with a water bottle is like finding a needle in a haystack,\u201d Murgatroyd captioned the video. There are TikToks marveling at the size of European water glasses, Instagram Reels chronicling the often ill-fated quest to order a jug of tap water in a European bar and posts on X bemoaning paying for bottled water in restaurants. Sula, who chronicles her life abroad on the blog Helene in Between, has weighed in on the great European tap water debate a couple of times \u2013 including at the end of last year: \u201cTap water is not free at (European) restaurants,\u201d Sula asserted in a November 2023 TikTok video. \u201cAnd if you do get it, it comes in a miniscule glass.\u201d Plenty of commentators were dismissive: \u201cIt\u2019s free. They\u2019ve seen you coming from a mile off,\u201d read one response. Others echoed Sula\u2019s experience, adding that while tap water is usually available \u2013 bottled mineral water or bottled filtered water is more commonplace in many European countries. \u201cI think it\u2019s a really interesting conversation,\u201d says Sula. \u201cThe world can feel very small sometimes, because we\u2019re all online and it\u2019s such a global society now \u2026 so I think it\u2019s interesting to have these conversations, to talk about the differences.\u201d A water expert weighs in To get a sense of what\u2019s really going on beyond just the anecdotal evidence, CNN Travel called up Stavros A. Kavouras, a professor of nutrition at Arizona State University. Kavouras is director of the university\u2019s Hydration Science Lab, which focuses on the impact of hydration on health and performance. Kavouras is also a Greek expat who\u2019s lived in the US for 20 years, so he\u2019s pretty well placed to comment on transatlantic culture clashes. First off, Kavouras emphasizes the myriad of differences between the countries that comprise the European continent. He highlights, for example, the contrast between \u201cNorthern European foods versus French, Italian, Greek cuisine, and dietary preferences.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t like the generalizations,\u201d says Kavouras, who says while it\u2019s tempting to set up a Europe versus the US dichotomy, it doesn\u2019t usually stand up. Kavouras also points out that Americans who visit Europe (and post about it online) don\u2019t represent the majority of the US population. \u201cIt\u2019s not the average American,\u201d says Kavouras. \u201cThe skewed population that you see coming to Europe \u2013 they are people that are more educated, wealthier, higher socioeconomic status\u2026\u201d This is relevant, states Kavouras, because there\u2019s data to suggest Americans of lower socioeconomic status drink less water. But after laying down these parameters and qualifications, Kavouras agrees there are some potential differences between the US and Europe when it comes to \u201cwhat people drink, what people like, and how hydrated they are.\u201d \u201cFor instance, if you go to Germany and you ask for water, you get sparkling water. That\u2019s the default,\u201d Kavouras says. \u201cAnd so if you served tap water in Germany, to every human, people would be like, \u2018Oh, I don\u2019t drink this water.\u2019 So why would you do it?\u201d Kavouras also notes that paying a few euros extra for a liter glass bottle of water at dinner is more accepted in Europe than the US. While Americans might be shocked, it\u2019s something many Europeans wouldn\u2019t think twice about, says Kavouras. He suggests Americans perturbed by the extra cost could look at it as \u201cthe equivalent of the American tip that you have to pay guaranteed 17 to 25% nowadays in the United States.\u201d (Tipping culture in Europe is quite different \u2013 and usually involves much smaller percentages) As for whether Europeans are generally more dehydrated than Americans, Kavouras says it\u2019s interesting that there\u2019s a difference between the dietary guidelines for water intake in the US and Europe. \u201cIn the United States, the guidelines are 2.7 liters for females, and 3.7 liters per day for men. And in Europe, the equivalent numbers are 2.0 and 2.5,\u201d he says. \u201cSo these are the guidelines \u2013 it doesn\u2019t mean this is what people drink \u2013 but this is what is recommended.\u201d And as for the American TikTokers joking about tap water served in tiny \u201cshot glasses\u201d in Europe, Kavouras suggests this could be part of a more general difference between the US and the rest of the world. \u201cI mean, you know the stereotype \u2013 the US does it bigger for everything \u2013 cars, houses, everything is bigger, servings in restaurants\u2026etc. I think it might be a little bit of that,\u201d says Kavouras \u2013 adding the same applies for the \u201cthe water carry containers that Americans carry around.\u201d Kavouras always finds it amusing when he spots his colleagues coming into work with \u201ca tiny barrel of water, like there\u2019s no water in the building.\u201d Giant water containers are \u201cunnecessary\u201d in Kavouras\u2019 opinion. That said, Kavouras advises everyone should find a way to ensure they\u2019re well-hydrated throughout the day \u2013 whether they\u2019re working in an American office or walking around a European city. \u201cWater is a critical component of every healthy diet. So being adequately hydrated, it\u2019s very important, especially in the summer,\u201d he says. Advice for Americans If you\u2019re an American traveler heading to Europe this summer and panicking about the water situation, Kavouras advice is to, first off, take all the viral social media posts with a pinch of salt. It\u2019s worth researching the specific destination you\u2019re heading to, and finding out what\u2019s the norm there \u2013 rather than assuming every country in Europe is the same. Familiarize yourself with the words used for sparkling, still and tap water in your destination\u2019s language, so you can make sure to order your preference. And if you want to skip bottled water at restaurants, Kavouras suggests staying hydrated by stocking up at a grocery store instead: \u201cBottled water is not as expensive if you plan a little bit and buy the water from the supermarket, versus buying it always in restaurants.\u201d And Kavouras\u2019 final piece of advice? Pack a reusable water bottle in your suitcase and carry it with you throughout your vacation \u2013 not only on your travel days. \u201cTap water in most European cities is potable, it\u2019s safe, and you can drink it,\u201d Kavouras says. Many European cities have fountains across the city where people can stop and hydrate. Hotels, cafes and restaurants will usually fill up your bottle for you if you ask. \u201cBring an empty water bottle \u2013 it really doesn\u2019t have to be a gallon,\u201d says Kavouras. \u201cJust bring a normal size water bottle so you can refill it whenever you have a chance.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/tiktok-tap-water-europe-trend/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "world"}}

The unnamed European, described by police as a 43-year-old man, visited the game reserve in South Africa\u2019s North West Province on Sunday, in a private vehicle, according to provincial police spokesperson Sabata Mokgwabone. He was accompanied by his fiancee and two other women, Mokgwabone said in a statement sent to CNN Wednesday. Spanish newspaper La Vanguardia identified the tourist as Carlos Luna, whom it said was from Zaragoza. The Pilanesberg Game Reserve is South Africa\u2019s fourth-largest park and a popular tourist destination. It is also home to more than\u00a07,000 animals, according to its website. Police said that while touring the park, the man and his passengers \u201cspotted three elephants with three calves,\u201d adding that \u201cthe man stopped the vehicle, alighted\u00a0and\u00a0went closer to take pictures\u201d before he was attacked and killed by the herd. The province\u2019s tourism board said in a statement that the Spaniard \u201cdid not heed the warnings\u201d of \u201chis fellow passengers, and occupants from two other vehicles that were at the sighting\u201d before approaching the elephants \u201cthat were feeding a distance from the road.\u201d \u201cAn adult elephant cow charged at the man, who then ran \u2026 (but) was unfortunately not able to escape or evade the elephant, which was now joined by the whole herd, and was caught and trampled to death,\u201d the board said. It added that the elephants left the scene afterward and did not attack anyone. \u201cStatements by witnesses who observed the\u00a0whole\u00a0incident further suggest that the female elephant that charged and attacked might have done so to protect the herd and young ones.\u201d Plans are being made to repatriate the tourist\u2019s body, the Spanish newspaper said, citing officials. Elephant attacks are not rare in South Africa. In 2019, a suspected poacher was attacked and killed by an elephant, and his body\u00a0eaten\u00a0by lions\u00a0in the northeastern Kruger National Park, authorities said at the time. In the same year, a security guard was similarly crushed to death by an elephant at a mine in the country\u2019s Limpopo province. Other parts of Southern Africa have witnessed similar tragedies. Three months ago, an elderly American woman was killed after an elephant charged at a vehicle transporting tourists inside Zambia\u2019s largest national park. The North West tourism board said it was \u201csaddened\u201d by the incident at the Pilanesberg park, urging tourists to \u201crespect distance between vehicles and animals and \u2026 to only alight in specially designated areas.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/10/africa/elephants-kill-spanish-tourist-south-africa-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_10_weather_beryl-texas-power-outages-heat-wednesday", "text": "Life-threatening heat is gripping southeast Texas, where more than 1.5 million homes and businesses remain without power and air conditioning for a third day after Beryl caused\u00a0major power outages, including\u00a0the largest in one major energy provider\u2019s history. Restoring electricity across the region is expected to take days \u2013 and in some cases weeks \u2013 after Beryl tore through the state as a Category 1 hurricane Monday, flooding coastal communities, shredding homes and ripping down webs of power lines. And what\u2019s left of the storm is still threatening to cause destruction Wednesday in the form of tornadoes and flooding more than 1,000 miles away in the Northeast. So impactful was the storm in Texas that the utility provider responsible for most of the outages said it was a historic event. \u201cWe have never seen an incident of this magnitude \u2013 this is the largest outage in our history,\u201d Brad Tutunjian, CenterPoint\u2019s vice president of Electric Distribution and Power Delivery, said during a Houston City Council meeting Wednesday. The utility has been servicing the area for \u201cover a hundred years,\u201d he noted. As power outages continue to plague Houston, there has been a three-time increase in call volume from residents contacting emergency officials. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen over 200 carbon monoxide poisoning calls in the last 24 hours,\u201d Houston Fire Chief Samuel Pe\u00f1a said during a Wednesday afternoon news conference. Pe\u00f1a cited the improper use of generators at homes and people turning on their cars to charge devices in their garages. He also said they are seeing an increase in medical emergencies related to the heat. Homes have become saunas and food languishes in warm refrigerators, mainly from Galveston to north of Houston, according to\u00a0PowerOutage.us. Phone and internet access has also been cut off in some communities, including Galveston. \u201cNo WiFi, no power, and it\u2019s hot outside. That\u2019s dangerous for people. That\u2019s really the big issue,\u201d Houston resident Robin Taylor told the Associated Press. \u201cPeople will die in this heat in their homes.\u201d Beryl has been blamed for at least 11 deaths in Texas and Louisiana, mainly from fallen trees. Two deaths in Houston\u2019s Harris County were the result of carbon monoxide poisoning, Texas emergency officials said, prompting warnings about the dangers using generators in areas where families are living and sleeping. A 71-year-old woman died in Galveston County Monday after her oxygen machine ran out of battery while her power was out, state Sen. Mayes Middleton, confirmed in a news conference Tuesday. Cooling centers have opened across the region as air temperatures crept into the 90s and the heat index teased 105 degrees. The heat index \u2013 a measurement of how the body feels under both heat and humidity \u2013 will reach triple digits across Texas each afternoon through at least the weekend. Most of the West and South of the country are in the throes of a long-lasting heat wave that has seen dozens of records broken and caused multiple deaths. Prolonged heat exposure poses significant health risks for people without adequate cooling and may be especially dangerous for Texans working outdoors to clear debris or damaged infrastructure. Heat also presents increased risks for the elderly, people with chronic medical conditions, homeless people and children. Hospitals in Houston are at risk of overcrowding as they cannot release patients to homes without power, prompting city officials to organize overflow beds in an indoor sports stadium, Patrick said Tuesday. On Wednesday, the office of Houston City Council Member Joaquin Martinez delivered water to two senior facilities without power in his district. One room had some electricity in one of the facilities, but at the second, people had to gather outside to stay cool, a representative from his office told CNN. \u201cThey were desperate and expressed concern,\u201d the representative said. The power outage also shuttered nine fire stations, as they didn\u2019t have generators, Houston Mayor John Whitmire said Wednesday afternoon. \u201cI get really, really upset when I learn the City of Houston does not have generators at essential services like a fire station,\u201d a frustrated Whitmire said during the news conference. \u201cGreat cities should not operate like that \u2013 it\u2019s neglect, it\u2019s severe neglect and we\u2019re going to fix it as we go forward.\u201d Long lines of cars and residents snaked out of fast food restaurants, food trucks and gas stations in the hopes of getting a few minutes of cool air or a bite to eat, according to the AP. Dwight Yell, 54, had power at his house but took a disabled neighbor, who did not, to Denny\u2019s for some food, the outlet reports. Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick has stressed to CenterPoint Energy the importance of restoring power as quickly as possible. The utility estimates about 80% of its customers in Houston are without power. \u201cIt\u2019s tough to be in the heat. It\u2019s tough not to be able to refrigerate anything and tough not being able to go out and get food,\u201d Patrick said. \u201cI made sure that CenterPoint was aware of that and asked them to pull out all the stops to get power back as quickly as they could.\u201d But CenterPoint officials say it could be several days before power is fully restored to its customers, though it hopes to restore service to 1 million customers by Wednesday night. As of Wednesday afternoon, more than 1.2 million of its customers were still in the dark. \u201cAlmost universally, people have lost patience with CenterPoint,\u201d City Council Member Julian Ramirez\u00a0told CNN Wednesday. While some people are trying to stay with friends and family who have power, many can\u2019t afford to leave their homes, Ramirez said. Food is another concern, as many stores are still closed, he said, so his office, food banks and public services are trying to quickly distribute food to underserved areas. \u201cCenterPoint can\u2019t seem to tell us how long this is going to last,\u201d he said. President Joe Biden on Tuesday approved a federal emergency disaster declaration that will assist with some recovery costs, including clearing debris, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott\u2019s office said. But before long-term recovery efforts get underway, many frustrated residents are grappling with how to address their immediate needs. \u201cIt\u2019s catastrophic when you lose everything in your fridge and you are living check to check,\u201d Harris County Commissioner Lesley Briones told the AP. Beryl barrels into Northeast Though Beryl has substantially weakened since slamming into Texas as a Category 1 hurricane, its remnants still pose serious flood and tornado threats Wednesday to the northern US. More than 10 million people are under flood watches across parts of the Midwest and Northeast. The watches will begin to expire for the Midwest by the end of the day Wednesday but will last in New England until Thursday morning. Heavy rainfall and a serious tornado threat began Wednesday afternoon in parts of the Northeast. Several tornado warnings occurred simultaneously in parts of New York and northern Pennsylvania. The most significant tornado threat will encompass areas from northern Pennsylvania to southern New Hampshire and Vermont through the evening. That includes Syracuse and Albany, New York, and Scranton, Pennsylvania. Beryl already whipped up more than a dozen tornadoes across Texas, Arkansas and Louisiana on Monday and two in Indiana and Kentucky on Tuesday. One damaging tornado in southwestern Indiana tore through a warehouse in Mount Vernon and shredded the roof and crushed tractor trailers. West\u2019s heat wave stretches to second week Heat alerts engulf more than 140 million Americans on both coasts, but the brunt of the heat is still impacting the West, where communities have been baking under high temperatures for at least two weeks. Extremely dangerous heat has caused several deaths in the West and will persist in the region through Friday, bringing high temperatures well into the 100s in some areas as temperatures reach between 10 to 30 degrees above average to some areas. California\u2019s Death Valley has reached or exceeded 125 degrees every day since July 4, and the streak is expected to continue through Friday, marking its second-longest streak of days above 125, behind 10 days in July 1913. In Nevada, Las Vegas hit 119 degrees Tuesday, which is its fourth straight day of breaking a daily high temperature record. \u201cThe multi-day length and record warm overnight temperatures will continue to cause heat stress to anyone without adequate cooling and hydration,\u201d the National Weather Service warned. Human-caused climate change is driving far more frequent and intense heat waves across the globe, exposing communities to increasingly dangerous temperatures. When a person is unable to cool their body down amid prolonged heat, they\u00a0are at risk\u00a0for damage to the brain and other vital organs, as well as other heat-related illnesses such as heat exhaustion and stroke. The weather service in Houston has advised residents to limit outdoor activities, work early or late in the day, wear light clothing and sunscreen and check on loved ones, neighbors and pets.

{"id": "2024_07_09_weather_beryl-storm-texas-power-outages-heat", "text": "Restoring power to millions of Texans slammed by the deadly and destructive storm Beryl could take days or even weeks, posing a dangerous scenario for residents without air conditioning as triple-digit heat index temperatures hit the state. Beryl slammed into southern Texas as a Category 1 hurricane Monday, knocking out power to more than 2.5 million homes and leaving at least eight people dead in Texas and Louisiana. More than 1.7 million customers, mostly in Galveston up through Houston, are still without power Tuesday night, according to PowerOutage.us. At least 34 utilities are experiencing outages. The storm unleashed flooding rains and winds that transformed roads into rushing rivers, ripped through power lines and tossed trees onto homes, roads and cars. President Biden granted a federal emergency disaster declaration for parts of Texas due to Beryl\u2019s destruction, acting Texas Gov. Dan Patrick announced Tuesday. \u201cFEMA\u2019s assistance with these costs will expedite the recovery process and help ensure the safety of Texans impacted by Hurricane Beryl,\u201d Patrick said. The emergency declaration will grant 75% reimbursement for debris cleanup for all 121 impacted Texas counties, Texas Division of Emergency Management Chief W. Nim Kidd said at a Tuesday news conference. What\u2019s left of Beryl is hurtling into the Midwest. Despite having lost strength and its core, it still threatens to trigger more flooding and tornadoes along its path. As difficult recovery and cleanup efforts are underway in southeast Texas, including the Houston area, extreme heat is bearing down on the region Tuesday and will continue for much of the week, creating hazardous conditions for those working outdoors, the elderly, people with chronic medical conditions, children and those without adequate cooling. The heat index in Houston passed 100 degrees on Tuesday. The heat index measures how the body feels under both heat and humidity. Both Houston\u2019s George Bush Intercontinental Airport and William P. Hobby Airport reported a heat index of 103 degrees by early Tuesday afternoon. Air temperatures in the region will climb into the 90s through at least early next week. When a person is unable to cool their body down amid prolonged heat, they are at risk for damage to the brain and other vital organs, as well as other heat-related illnesses such as heat exhaustion and stroke. Heat is the deadliest form of extreme weather in the US, killing more than twice as many people each year as hurricanes and tornadoes combined. With some residents opting for generators in the wake of outages, Kidd noted at least two carbon monoxide poisoning deaths have been reported in Harris County, home to Houston. \u201cIf you have a generator that you\u2019re running, please make sure it is far away from the area that you are living and sleeping,\u201d Kidd explained, adding such deaths are preventable. But restoring power to hard-hit communities will be a multi-day undertaking, according to Thomas Gleeson, the chairman of the Public Utility Commission of Texas. And in the coastal city of Galveston, city officials have estimated it could be as many as two weeks before electricity is restored. Utility company says damage was more severe than expected Texas utility CenterPoint Energy has borne the brunt of the outages, and though the company had braced for Beryl\u2019s impact, it said the damage was more severe than it had expected. As of Tuesday night, CenterPoint still had more than 1.3 million customers without service. \u201cThe storm veered off the originally expected course and more heavily impacted the company\u2019s customers, systems and infrastructure than previously anticipated, resulting in outages to more than 2.26 million customers at its peak,\u201d the utility said. That amounts to 80% of CenterPoint\u2019s Houston region customers, company representative Paul Lock said during a Tuesday evening news conference. Earlier Tuesday, Patrick said he has repeatedly urged CenterPoint Energy to \u201cwork as quickly as they can\u201d to restore power. \u201cIt\u2019s tough to be in the heat. It\u2019s tough now to be able to refrigerate anything and tough not being able to go out and get food,\u201d he added. The utility had said they expected to restore power to 1 million customers by Wednesday night. CenterPoint also hopes to complete full damage assessments by the end of the Tuesday, company spokesperson Logan Anderson told CNN Tuesday afternoon. In the evening news conference, Lock said he couldn\u2019t give a timeline for power restoration, \u201cbut it is not going to be tomorrow.\u201d He said the utility will provide a system-wide restoration timeline after the damage assessments are complete. Houston Mayor John Whitmire, whose home was also without power Monday, said CenterPoint and the city are \u201cfully aware\u201d of how pressing electricity restoration is. \u201cWe\u2019re going to take care of every community. No community is favored over another community. Every Houstonian is important to us. We\u2019ll get your power on as quickly as possible,\u201d he said. In Katy, Texas, just west of Houston, resident Lizzette Varela said her home lost power Monday morning and hasn\u2019t regained it since. Her family is trying to find access to lodging, internet and food storage on a day-to-day basis, she told CNN. \u201cThere is no clear word from CenterPoint. They expect that by Wednesday there will be 1 million more people with electricity, but there\u2019s 2 million people without power. How do you know if you\u2019re part of the 50% with power? It\u2019s like a game,\u201d she said. Mayor Gregg Bisso of Surfside Beach, Texas \u2013 located 60 miles south of Houston \u2013 said he is \u201cmad as hell\u201d at CenterPoint, as 90% of the Gulf Coast destination is without power. \u201cWe are the first to get hit\u2014and hit the hardest\u2014but because we are over the bridge, we are the last ones to get service back,\u201d Bisso said. Bisso said most residents thankfully heeded a voluntary evacuation order, as Beryl brought sustained winds of well-over 90 mph that damaged countless homes \u2013 with some missing whole roofs. Houston residents working through aftermath The Houston Zoo is also working to clean up damage and flooding from Beryl, Jackie Wallace, assistant vice president of communications and public affairs, told CNN Tuesday. All the animals are safe and fared well throughout the hurricane and power outage, Wallace said, as the zoo used generators until power was restored late Tuesday morning. A team of staff spent Sunday and Monday overnight at the zoo to ensure the safety of the animals and take care of any emergency issues on the grounds. The animals spent the nights, as usual, safely in their barns, Wallace said. In recent years, the zoo has undergone extensive upgrades with hurricanes and freezes in mind, which included an office garage being built on campus for staff to ride out storms. The zoo will remain closed until Thursday. Some other businesses are staying open, however. For Crystal Petty, the manager of a Baskin-Robbins in southwestern Houston, business is busier than usual as people clamor for relief from the high temperatures and humidity. \u201cI have a phone call coming in about every 30 minutes with someone asking if we\u2019re open or not,\u201d Petty told CNN. Petty\u2019s store regained power at 7 a.m. Tuesday with most of their products still good to sell \u2013 save the ice cream cake display, which had melted from being in the front window. Scoops were being served a cool four hours later. From her correspondence with other local stores, Petty believes her Baskin-Robbins might be the only one in the city still with power. Beryl\u2019s path through the US At its peak, Beryl was a record-shattering Category 5 storm but has since been reduced to a far less powerful system with winds of 30 mph. Still, what\u2019s left of Beryl will produce flooding and tornadoes in the US as it moves inland through mid-week. Beryl became the first storm in the Atlantic hurricane season to make landfall in the US after tearing a devastating path through the Caribbean, where it caused at least nine other deaths. The storm marks the start to a hurricane season experts say will be far from normal, as fossil fuel pollution contributes to abnormally warm water and rapidly intensifying storms. The center of the storm will continue through Illinois by the end of Tuesday. It is then expected to blow into Indiana on\u00a0Wednesday morning and race through Ohio and Michigan and into Canada by the end of the week. The threat of tornadoes linked to Beryl increased Tuesday, prompting the Storm Prediction Center to upgrade the risk of severe thunderstorms\u00a0to a level 3 of 5 for western Kentucky and southern Indiana. Parts of the Ohio and Mississippi valleys are under a level 2 of 5 severe thunderstorm threat, primarily for tornadoes associated with the storms, according to the\u00a0center. Fourteen tornadoes from Beryl were reported Monday in Texas, Louisiana and southern Arkansas. About 23.4 million people are under flood watches Tuesday. Flash flood warnings were issued along the storm\u2019s path Tuesday morning. Heat sprawls across the West Heat alerts have been issued\u00a0Tuesday\u00a0for about half of the US population, spanning both coasts, but the West coast being hit particularly hard. An oppressive heat wave is blanketing the West and will hover over the region for several more days, likely bringing high temperatures between 10 to 30 degrees above average to some areas. Human-caused climate change is driving far more frequent and intense heat waves across the globe, exposing communities to increasingly dangerous temperatures. Excessive heat warnings, watches and heat advisories are in effect for nearly all of Washington state, Oregon, California, Idaho, Nevada and southwest Arizona. Parts of western Nevada and northeastern California won\u2019t see high temperatures below 100 degrees until next weekend,\u00a0the National Weather Service office in Reno said. In Oregon, four people died of suspected heat-related illnesses over the weekend, and another suspected heat-related death was reported Monday, according to\u00a0news releases\u00a0from Multnomah County. A motorcyclist also died from heat exposure in California\u2019s Death Valley on Saturday, when the high temperature was 128 degrees. In Arizona, a 50-year-old hiker died amid searing temperatures Sunday on the Grand Canyon\u2019s Bright Angel Trail, according to the National Park Service.

{"id": "2024_05_25_style_zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk", "text": "Above Beijing\u2019s imperial center rises Jingshan, or Prospect Hill. From a pagoda at its modest peak, a panoramic view of the city presents itself. To the south, the dull golden roofs of the Forbidden City crest and fall, pulling the eye southward to Tiananmen \u2014 the Gate of Heavenly Peace \u2014 and the vast square of the same name just beyond. To the east stand the smooth metallic skyscrapers of the city\u2019s business district. To the north, at the top of Beijing\u2019s central axis \u2014 its so-called dragon\u2019s vein \u2014 sit the Bell and Drum Towers, which once acted as the city\u2019s collective timepiece. And stretching all along the western periphery are the calm, tree-lined waters of the manmade lakes, dug by hand for the pleasure of past emperors. It\u2019s this aerial view of \u201cZhongnanhai,\u201d meaning \u201cmiddle and southern seas,\u201d and the surrounding buildings that today\u2019s Chinese leaders prefer you did not see. That\u2019s because the 1,500-acre site of repurposed imperial pavilions and temples, along with gray modern offices has formed the leadership compound for the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP)  since 1950. As the seat of power, Zhongnanhai is often thought of as China\u2019s equivalent to the White House, or the Kremlin. Synonymous with China\u2019s communist party elite, and among the country\u2019s most secretive places, it is ringed by a centuries-old red ochre wall, with countless CCTV cameras periscoping above it \u2014 and patrolled assiduously by security forces in both plain clothes and uniform. A peaceful getaway For Chinese leader Xi Jinping\u2019s imperial forebears, the site served a somewhat different function. While emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties ruled their vast kingdom from within the Forbidden City, they built temples, halls and living quarters in Zhongnanhai; less grandly ceremonial than those of the palace, they were often oriented to take advantage of the views afforded by the area\u2019s tranquil waters and carefully planned gardens. Many of these emperors came to favor passing their days surrounded by drooping willows in the cool and quiet of this cultivated pleasure garden. A story relayed by the scholar Geremie Barm\u00e9 in his book \u201cThe Forbidden City\u201d tells of the 18th-century Qianlong Emperor\u2019s daily routine at Zhongnanhai: Each morning, after a first breakfast of cold swallows nest soup, he would travel by heated palanquin to the gardens\u2019\u00a0Studio of Convivial Delight,\u00a0a pavilion he built to capitalize on the view of the South Lake, where he would breakfast again on a meal of\u00a018 dishes. As the historian and author of \u201cThe Shortest History of China,\u201d Linda Jaivin, told CNN via email: \u201cThere is something outrageous and yet poetic about the incredible coordination and effort required of a team of bearers, cooks and attendants, just so that an emperor could come, catch a view of the magnificent Ocean Terrace, scoff his food and (leave).\u201d The first ruler to view Zhongnanhai as primarily a place to govern from, not simply relax in, was the Empress Dowager Cixi, who effectively controlled China for almost five decades from 1861. She lived for many years in the gardens\u2019 Hall of Ceremonial Phoenixes, which became the center of political authority in China. She would die there in 1908. The serene surroundings of Zhongnanhai also became, under Cixi, a place of punishment and confinement. In 1898, following attempted reforms that displeased her, Cixi imprisoned her nephew, the Guangxu Emperor, on Yingtai Island, which juts out into the southern lake. Built as a miniature version of the mythical Penglai island, home to the immortals of Chinese legend, the tiny piece of land would become the emperor\u2019s home for most of his life, bar a brief period when the Boxer rebellion of 1900 forced the whole court to flee the capital. He would die on Yingtai Island from arsenic poisoning the day before the Empress Dowager herself. His imprisonment and death, said writer M. A. Aldrich, author of \u201cThe Search for a Vanishing Beijing: A Guide to China\u2019s Capital Through the Ages,\u201d perhaps adds a touch of poignancy for any subsequent resident of Zhongnanhai. \u201cIn addition to being a site that preserves sites of imperial splendor,\u201d he told CNN, \u201cit also functions as a reminder to the political elite about the consequences for stepping out of line.\u201d For Aldrich, however, the Zhongnanhai compound also represents the destructive impulses of the CCP towards its adopted capital in the years after 1949, when Mao Zedong proclaimed the foundation of the People\u2019s Republic. \u201cAs a political symbol of the New China, it has been torn up, rebuilt, expanded, and revamped so many times that its connection with its elegant past has been lost,\u201d Aldrich said. Architectural changes There have been serious revisions to the architecture of Zhongnanhai since the end of imperial rule in 1912. After the last emperor abdicated the throne, China\u2019s new president Yuan Shikai granted him the right to live on the northern section of the Forbidden City \u2014 and then took Zhongnanhai to be his new administration\u2019s headquarters. The changes he made to the imperial gardens were disparaged by many of the Westerners who visited them. \u201cWhatever may be one\u2019s opinion as to whether Yuan Shikai \u2018exalted his aim\u2019 in his political career, he certainly cannot be said to have done so as builder and architect,\u201d wrote L.C. Arlington and William Lewisohn in their 1935 book \u201cIn Search of Old Peking,\u201d \u201cfor all the buildings that have been erected or restored by him are in the worst possible taste.\u201d Most notable of these changes \u2014 at least to ordinary Beijingers \u2014 was the repurposing of a two-story pavilion at the very south of the gardens. Known as the Precious Moon Tower, it had been built decades earlier by the Qianlong Emperor for a homesick lover, a Muslim woman from Xinjiang, taken to Beijing as part of the spoils of war. The concubine would gaze south from the tower toward a mock mosque and bazaar the emperor had especially constructed to assuage her longing for home. Yuan refashioned this pavilion into the main entrance to his presidential compound, and established a tall watchtower just to its east. The gate was named Xinhuamen, or the Gate of New China. Today, the structure remains coated in the same deep red that graces the walls of all Beijing\u2019s imperial buildings, with a roof of glazed yellow tiles and detailing that runs below the roofline, picked out in blue and gold. The gate is now flanked by two red banners that speak to its modern purpose as China\u2019s political and party headquarters: \u201cLong Live the Great Communist Party of China\u201d reads one; and \u201cLong Live the Invincible Mao Zedong Thought\u201d on the other. On a screen wall recessed behind the entrance way, Chinese characters written in Mao\u2019s own calligraphic style declare: \u201cServe the People.\u201d Facing out onto Beijing\u2019s main east-west thoroughfare, the gate remains the most conspicuous part of Zhongnanhai. The rest of the compound has, since 1989, been firmly off-limits to the Chinese public. Seat of power Initially, after the communist victory in China\u2019s civil war in 1949, Mao Zedong took up residence at Shuangqing Villa in Fragrant Hills, another former imperial garden to the west of Beijing. Though wary of establishing himself in the imperial heart of Beijing \u2014 it is said that he refused ever to enter the Forbidden City, for fear of being associated with the power structures of old, feudal China he had fought to overthrow \u2014 Mao ultimately moved into Zhongnanhai and, in late 1949, he set up in the\u00a0Garden of Abundant Beneficence,\u00a0a large courtyard compound favored by both the Qianlong and Kangxi emperors, where he would hold court with dignitaries\u00a0and live\u00a0until 1966. Having re-established Zhongnanhai as a center of political power in the new China, Mao set about rebuilding the compound according to his tastes. \u201cSince 1949, an assortment of new architecture styles has encroached into Zhongnanhai, with a tennis court, gymnasium, swimming pools and Western buildings topped off with Chinese eave roofs adding a discordant note that would not have been appreciated by its traditionally-minded original owners,\u201d said Aldrich. In 1966, Mao moved from the Garden of Abundant Beneficence to a specially built house beside his beloved indoor swimming pool. He often summoned officials to speak to him as he bobbed in the water \u2014 and famously received Russian leader Nikita Khrushchev at his pool during a 1958 visit. \u201cTheir interpreters had to pace alongside the edge of the pool,\u201d said Jaivin. \u201cThe Russian couldn\u2019t swim and had to wear water wings. Mao loved both swimming and putting Khrushchev in his place. Finally, Khrushchev got sick of it, and clambered out to sit on the edge, dangling his feet in the water.\u201d In the residence next door, Mao lined his rooms with bookshelves housing an extensive library of Chinese classical literature. \u201cIt was here,\u201d noted Aldrich, \u201cwith the background trappings of a scholar, that he met Nixon and Kissinger in 1972.\u201d Most subsequent leaders have preferred to keep a house outside the Zhongnanhai compound. Deng Xiaoping lived, from 1977, in a courtyard house on a nearby lane adjacent to Beihai, the \u201cNorthern Sea\u201d of central Beijing\u2019s chain of lakes. While not officially disclosed, it is believed that more contemporary leaders, including Xi Jinping and his predecessors Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, have maintained homes in an exclusive gated compound in Jade Spring Hill, sometimes called the \u201cback garden\u201d of Chinese politics, out to the city\u2019s west. Aldrich noted that those leaders and party cadres who used Zhongnanhai as their primary residence often attracted unwelcome scrutiny for their activities, particularly during years of political turbulence. \u201cIn his memoirs, Chairman Mao\u2019s physician, Li Zhisui, commented that (the complex\u2019s) residents were always under surveillance,\u201d Aldrich said. \u201cDuring the Cultural Revolution, the simple act of making a fire would bring down the wrath of the security guards on the perpetrator. It was believed that such a fire was proof that incriminating or seditious materials were being destroyed.\u201d The imperial gardens offering vistas of Zhongnanhai\u2019s lakes have, today, been filled in with dozens of gray offices and meeting halls, many of which date to 1970s, when Zhongnanhai underwent significant razing and renovation \u2014 the rebuilding was so extensive that one visitor in 1979 described the grounds resembling a construction site, with muddy roads that were impossible to walk on. The contemporary compound splits roughly in two, with the northern buildings, on the banks of the \u201cmiddle lake,\u201d used as the headquarters of China\u2019s top executive body, the State Council. It is here that foreign dignitaries are admitted. Around the \u201csouthern lake,\u201d meanwhile, are the headquarters of the CCP, including, within Qinzheng Hall (the Hall of Diligent Government), the offices of the general secretary of the party (a post currently held by Xi). Many of the most historically significant political events to occur at Zhongnanhai have taken place in Huairen Hall, or the Hall of Cherished Compassion, on the western side of the Middle Lake. The hall was added to the imperial park during the late Qing dynasty, but was then extensively remodeled by the CCP in the early 1950s to impart a more august socialist grandeur. It is a broad, imposing ceremonial hall with staggered roofs of glazed green tiles falling in curved lines to upturned corners; the facade of austere grey brick is interrupted by red wooden pillars, windows and doors. The building\u2019s capacious interior houses a large auditorium, as well as numerous smaller meeting rooms. The hall has, for decades, served as the main meeting place for China\u2019s Politburo, the party\u2019s decision-making body usually comprising about two dozen members. On occasion, it has also hosted the Politburo\u2019s Standing Committee, the core of China\u2019s political elite, (the power of both bodies has notably dwindled in the era of Xi), though they most commonly meet in Qinzheng Hall, close to the general secretary\u2019s office. During the tumult of the Cultural Revolution vital discussions and debates occurred at Huairen Hall, and, in the months after its conclusion, it was there that three of the so-called Gang of Four \u2014 the political faction that included Mao\u2019s wife held responsible for the worst excesses of the era \u2014 were arrested, tricked into attending a meeting they thought was about the publication of the fifth volume of Mao\u2019s Selected Works. In April 1989, former party head Hu Yaobang suffered a heart-attack during a Politburo meeting at Huairen; his death a week later would trigger the Tiananmen Square protests that the government forcibly cracked down on in early June of that year. However, the compound hasn\u2019t always been so forbidden for the masses following the collapse of China\u2019s imperial dynasty. In the late 1920s, it became a park, with tourists allowed to boat on and swim in the lakes, while in the 1980s, the public could access some of its scenic and historical spots, including\u00a0Mao\u2019s\u00a0former residence, on\u00a0organized weekend tours.\u00a0Even early in 1989, a journalist for the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0was able to casually\u00a0drive\u00a0a senior official into the compound and drop him off inside.\u00a0During a period of warmer US and China relations in 2011, former Chinese president\u00a0Hu Jintao\u00a0invited\u00a0a group of American high school students to Zhongnanhai. Modern security concerns Today, Zhongnanhai is more closely-guarded than ever, though the inexorable development of the city has caused problems in maintaining the compound\u2019s secrecy. When an annex to the nearby Beijing Hotel was built in\u00a01973, authorities were panicked by the realization that from its upper floors one could quite easily see \u2013 and potentially target a sniper rifle \u2013 into Zhongnanhai. A building was hastily erected on the western edge of the Forbidden City to restrict this view. Likewise in 2018, when Beijing\u2019s new tallest building was\u00a0completed\u00a0\u2013 the 528-meter Citic tower, better known as the \u201cZun\u201d \u2013 the country\u2019s national security apparatus reportedly requisitioned the top floors amid fears that visitors or occupants might be able to spy into the compound. Beijing authorities did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on the security situation at the time. Zhongnanhai\u2019s entrance, Xinhuamen, has also been the site of repeated demonstrations in recent decades; in 1989, it was a gathering point for students taking part in the Tiananmen protests, whilst in 1999, more than 10,000 members of the since-banned Falun Gong gathered on the sidewalks near Zhongnanhai to protest their treatment at the hands of the government. So, while Zhongnanhai is sometimes compared to the White House, Aldrich argues that the paranoia with which the compound is today guarded makes it more like the imperial palace of centuries past: \u201cSince ordinary people are not allowed to enter Zhongnanhai, it is probably more appropriate to describe it as a \u2018New Forbidden City\u2019 for China\u2019s ruling elite rather than a place with a personal political resonance for the average citizen,\u201d he said. \u201cHeck, even the Kremlin is open to tourists!\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/style/zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "world"}}

Philippine Coast Guard spokesperson Jay Tarriela said the China Coast Guard vessel CCG-5901 anchored near Sabina Shoal in the Spratly Islands, about 80 miles (130 kilometers) northwest of the Philippine island of Palawan on July 3, well within Manila\u2019s 230-mile EEZ. Displacing 12,000 tons and with a length of 541 feet, CCG-5901 is three times the size of the United States Coast Guard\u2019s main patrol vessels, the National Security Cutters - leading many observers to refer to the Chinese vessel as \u201cThe Monster.\u201d While at Sabina Shoal, the Chinese ship anchored within 800 yards of one of the Philippine Coast Guard\u2019s newest and biggest ships previously deployed to the area, Tarriela said in a post on X. CCG-5901 is more than five times the size of the Philippine ship, the BRP Teresa Magbanua. \u201cIt\u2019s an intimidation on the part of the China Coast Guard,\u201d Tarriela said during a forum on Saturday, according to a Reuters report. But he said the Philippines would not back down on its South China Sea claims. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to pull out, and we\u2019re not going to be intimidated,\u201d Tarriela added. When asked the Philippine claims during a regular press briefing Monday, China\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs denied the area in question was part of the Philippines\u2019 exclusive economic zone. \u201cChina\u2019s military and police ships patrolling and enforcing the law in the waters near Xianbin Jiao are in compliance with China\u2019s domestic law and international law,\u201d spokesperson Lin Jian said, using the Chinese term for the Sabina Shoal. China claims \u201cindisputable sovereignty\u201d over almost all of the South China Sea, and most of the islands and sandbars within it, including many features that are hundreds of miles from mainland China. Multiple governments, including Manila, hold competing claims. In 2016, an international tribunal in The Hague ruled in favor of the Philippines in a landmark dispute, which concluded that China has no legal basis to claim historic rights to the bulk of the South China Sea. But Beijing has ignored the ruling. Instead it has increasingly pushed its maritime territorial claims, with China Coast Guard ships \u2013 reinforced by militia boats \u2013 involved in multiple clashes over the past year that have damaged Philippine ships and seen Filipino sailors injured by water cannon. A clash near Second Thomas Shoal in June saw Chinese coast guard officers\u00a0brandishing an axe\u00a0and other bladed or pointed tools at Filipino soldiers and\u00a0slashing\u00a0their rubber boat. A Filipino soldier lost a thumb during the confrontation. CCG-5901 wasn\u2019t involved in that incident but has been prowling areas of the Philippines\u2019 EEZ since, according to Ray Powell, a South China Sea expert and director of SeaLight at the Gordian Knot Center for National Security Innovation at Stanford University. \u201cImmediately following the dramatic standoff at Second Thomas Shoal \u2026 The Monster toured nearly every Philippine outpost and key feature in the South China Sea,\u201d Powell said. Powell and other analysts say intimidation is one of the main jobs of the CCG-5901, which is larger than any regular coast guard ship in the world (a specialty US Coast Guard icebreaker is bigger) and even outsizes US Navy destroyers. The Arleigh Burke-class destroyers displace 9,700 tons or less and are about 35 feet shorter than CCG-5901. The US Coast Guard\u2019s National Security Cutters, displace 4,500 tons, a third of the size of CCG-5901. In a firepower comparison, CCG-5901 also betters the US cutters, with two main 76.2-millimeters guns compared to one main 57-millimeter gun on the US ships. \u201cIts massive size enables it to intimidate its neighbors while avoiding the escalatory implications of sending a gray-hulled military vessel,\u201d Powell said, referring to navy ships. Coast guards, known as white-hulled vessels because of their color, are usually assigned to law enforcement and search-and-rescue operations. In most countries, they are not normally expected to participate in military operations. The US Coast Guard, for instance, is part of the US Department of Homeland Security, not the Defense Department, although US Coast Guard vessels can come under US Navy control in certain scenarios. The China Coast Guard is part of the country\u2019s People\u2019s Armed Police, which is under the command of the Central Military Commission. Analysts say that\u2019s a key difference between the two coast guard agencies. \u201cIt is not really intended to carry out traditional coast guard missions, but is primarily used as a central element in China\u2019s paramilitary maritime force,\u201d Powell said of \u201cThe Monster.\u201d Carl Schuster, a former director of operations at the US Pacific Command\u2019s Joint Intelligence Center, said CCG-5901\u2019s size and crew enable it to be a central command ship for a larger operation. He noted that a Chinese navy aircraft carrier was also operating near the Philippines in recent weeks and that the combination of the two is a coordinated effort to demonstrate overwhelming Chinese naval power to Manila. China has both the world\u2019s largest navy, in terms of sheer ship numbers, as well as the world\u2019s largest coast guard. Collin Koh, research fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore, said \u201cThe Monster\u201d shows the Chinese military\u2019s ability for \u201cescalation dominance,\u201d adding that the vessel the Philippines had previously sent to Sabina Shoal, the Teresa Magbanua, was one of its best. The China Coast Guard \u201cdoesn\u2019t want to be outdone thus this monster came along to show who\u2019s got a bigger set of muscles,\u201d Koh said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/asia/china-monster-coast-guard-ship-philippines-intl-hnk-ml/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "world"}}

The 50-year-old faced immense criticism after his US squad was eliminated in the group stage of the Copa America this month. That competition is ongoing with all games being played in the United States. The federation will now search for a new coach to lead the team as it looks toward the 2026 World Cup, which the US will co-host with Canada and Mexico. The federation\u2019s sporting director, Matt Crocker, has begun the search for Berhalter\u2019s replacement, according to US Soccer President Cindy Parlow Cone. \u201cI want to thank Gregg for his hard work and dedication to US Soccer and our Men\u2019s National Team,\u201d Cone said in a federation release. \u201c(Crocker will)\u00a0ensure we find the right person to lead the USMNT into a new era of on-field success,\u201d she said. Berhalter, initially hired in 2018, led the team to the knockout stage of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. His contract was allowed expire at the tournament\u2019s conclusion, and US Soccer announced in January 2023 it had commissioned an independent investigation into\u00a0allegations of misconduct\u00a0against him. Berhalter was cleared by US Soccer in March 2023 following the completion of the investigation. The probe acknowledged an incident of domestic violence between Berhalter and his then-girlfriend in 1992, but determined it was an isolated event with no evidence of similar conduct since. In June 2023 he was given a new contract that was to run through the conclusion of the 2026 World Cup. Berhalter finishes with a record of 44-17-13 in 74 matches. He also led the squad to a Gold Cup victory in 2021 and two CONCACAF Nations League titles.  Berhalter has \u201cearned the respect of everyone within our organization and has played a pivotal role in bringing together a young team and moving the program forward,\u201d Crocker said in the release. \u201cOur immediate focus is on finding a coach who can maximize our potential as we continue to prepare for the 2026 World Cup, and we have already begun our search process,\u201d Crocker added. \u201cUS Soccer is committed to doing what is necessary to ensure our success on the pitch and we are dedicated to fostering a culture that leads to winning,\u201d the organization said. The US got off to a good start in the Copa America tournament in June with a comfortable victory against Bolivia, but then suffered a shock defeat to Panama. The US then lost 1-0 to Uruguay in its final group game \u2013 meaning it finished third in Group C, out of the two qualifying places for the knockout stages. The poor performance piled pressure on Berhalter, with critics questioning whether he still was the right person to lead the team heading into the 2026 World Cup. The men\u2019s team is next scheduled to play on September 7 in an international friendly against Canada at Children\u2019s Mercy Park in Kansas City.

{"id": "2024_07_04_uk_uk-election-exit-poll-results-labour-conservative-starmer-gbr-intl", "text": "Keir Starmer is the United Kingdom\u2019s new prime minister after sweeping away a 14-year era of Conservative rule by leading his center-left Labour party to a massive landslide election victory. British rejected the Conservatives by a historic margin, and Starmer will be a very powerful prime minister. But there are urgent issues needing his attention. And as the the dust settles on the election, a number of eye-opening trends are clear. Here\u2019s what you need to know. Labour\u2019s huge, but fragile, landslide Labour\u2019s victory was seismic. It was very nearly unprecedented; only Tony Blair\u2019s Labour Party has ever won more seats in an election. Addressing the nation before entering 10 Downing Street on Friday afternoon, Starmer pledged a return to the politics of public service, vowing to heal the \u201cweariness at the heart of the nation\u201d with \u201caction not words.\u201d But Labour\u2019s win was also fragile. The vote breakdown made clear that the election was as much, if not more, about the public\u2019s anger towards the Conservatives as it was about excitement for Labour\u2019s offer. Starmer\u2019s party only increased its vote share by a few percentage points from its dismal 2019 showing, even though it may end up with almost twice as many seats. Starmer won a smaller vote share than his predecessor Jeremy Corbyn did in 2017, an election that Labour also lost. It was helped in seat after seat by a strong showing from populists Reform UK, who tore votes away from the Conservatives. Those stats highlight the oddities of Britain\u2019s first-past-the-post voting system, but also the dangers facing Starmer. He will govern with a powerful majority in parliament, but the public coalition he has built will not afford him a long honeymoon period. He will be opposed by the Conservatives, but also by Reform, which challenged Labour candidates in several seats around the country. And a throng of left-wing support will also attempt to detract attention from Starmer; his predecessor Corbyn, who had been expelled by the party, won as an independent in Islington North and will become the face of that opposition. Starmer was far more popular than Sunak, opinion polls showed, but he has never enjoyed the healthy approval ratings that Blair and Boris Johnson once did, lacking the natural charisma or campaigning prowess of those leaders. \u201cElection victories don\u2019t fall from the sky. They\u2019re hard won, and hard fought for,\u201d he acknowledged in a speech earlier on Friday. Starmer has promised \u201ca decade of national renewal,\u201d a pledge that nods to the deep-seated problems in Britain\u2019s public services but also the lengthy stint he intends to spend in government. Whether or not he completes that goal could depend heavily on the early impression he leaves on the public as Prime Minister. In a sign of the potential fragility of Labour\u2019s landslide, turnout is on track to be the lowest for more than 20 years.\u00a0With all but two seats declared as of Friday afternoon, turnout was at 60%\u00a0\u2013 down from 67.3% at the last election in 2019. If confirmed, it would be only the second time in more than a century that 40% of voters decided to skip the vote. A devastating Conservative defeat Unlike Labour\u2019s victory, there are no two sides to the Conservatives\u2019 performance. This was a woeful showing, after a dreadful campaign, and it has consigned the Tories not just to opposition but to the cusp of irrelevance. Senior Conservatives fell like dominoes in seat after seat; the party was decimated by Labour and Reform in the so-called Red Wall swathe of battleground seats across North England and the Midlands, and by the Liberal Democrats in affluent areas in southern England that it had previously controlled for decades. And a line of high-profile figures \u2013 the faces of a 14-year era of power \u2013 stunningly lost their seats. Penny Mourdant, Jacob Rees-Mogg, Robert Buckland, Alex Chalk and others were dumped from power. The outgoing chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, narrowly clung on. And the most sensational defeat was saved until last: shortly after 6 a.m. Friday, in one of the final seats to declare, former Prime Minister Liz Truss lost her previously ultra-safe seat. She refused to speak after her defeat, leaving the stage with her fellow candidates instead, attempting to retain a steely look on her face. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Sunak told activists and voters after winning his count. There was not much more he could say. Before this election, only three Cabinet ministers had lost their seat this century, and all were Lib Dems serving in coalition with the Conservatives. It opened up a furious and bitter backlash within the party about what went wrong. \u201cOur renewal as a party and a country will not be achieved by us talking to an ever-smaller slice of ourselves, but by being guided by the people of this country,\u201d Mordaunt said after losing her seat, implicitly taking aim at the populist wing of the party, which has recently sought to pull it towards the right on issues such as migration. Buckland was blunter. \u201cI\u2019m fed up with performance art politics,\u201d Buckland told the BBC. \u201cI\u2019ve watched colleagues in the Conservative Party strike poses, write inflammatory op-eds and say stupid things they have no evidence for instead of concentrating on doing the job that they were elected to do. \u201cI think we\u2019ve seen in this election astonishing ill-discipline within the party,\u201d he added. A battle for control of the Tories For some of the Conservative lawmakers who survived the wipeout, there was little time for mourning. A battle to seize the leadership of the party is underway after Sunak announced he would step down as Tory leader. Senior MPs who ran in the two recent elections for the post were pointed in their speeches, doing little to hide their ambitions. And the fight could be bitter. Two wings have split the party over the course of the last parliament, and will seek to control it now \u2013 a populist bloc who have employed tough rhetoric on migration and sought to battle Reform for votes, and a moderate wing eager to drag the party back to its \u201cOne Nation\u201d roots. \u201cI\u2019m\u00a0sorry\u00a0that my party didn\u2019t listen to you,\u201d Britain\u2019s former hardline Home Secretary Suella Braverman said at her count, in a speech that could well have been addressed purely to the party members that will select its next leader. \u201c(The) Conservative Party has let you down. You \u2013 the great British people \u2013\u00a0voted for us over 14 years and we did not keep our promises,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve acted as if we\u2019re entitled to your vote regardless of what we did, regardless of what we didn\u2019t do, despite promising time after time that we would do those things and we need to learn our lesson because if we don\u2019t, bad as tonight has been for my party, we\u2019ll have many worse nights to come.\u201d Kemi Badenoch will enter the leadership race as the favorite, if she runs. But the outgoing business and trade minister didn\u2019t reveal much about her intentions in her speech, choosing instead to congratulate Labour. The rise of Reform The exit poll threw up a huge surprise, signalling 13 seats for Reform \u2014 but the real results weren\u2019t as kind. The insurgent bloc didn\u2019t pick up all of the seats it was forecast \u2013 with almost all the votes counted, it has ended up with five \u2013 but it was a disruptive force throughout the night, leaping the Conservatives into second place in dozens of seats up and down the country. Nigel Farage, the group\u2019s leader who had tried seven times to win election to parliament, succeeded on the eight attempt and will become a noisy and trouble-making presence in Westminster. \u201cIt\u2019s not just disappointment with the Conservative Party. There is a massive gap on the center right of British politics and my job is to fill it. And that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m going to do,\u201d Farage said after winning the seat. He pledged to \u201cchallenge the general election properly in 2029,\u201d and promised to turn his rhetoric towards Labour as they prepare to enter government. Farage said the \u201cLabour government will be in trouble very, very quickly and we will now be targeting Labour votes. We\u2019re coming for Labour - be in no doubt about that.\u201d But in the short term, Farage will also be a prominent outside voice as the Conservatives decide on their next direction as the new opposition party. Reform\u2019s relative success follows a tone of populist fury across Europe, though it will remain a minor party in parliament. They benefited hugely from the Conservatives\u2019 failure to control legal and illegal migration, an issue it nonetheless placed at the center of their campaign. Scotland\u2019s independence movement suffers a staggering setback Ten years after Scotland voted to remain a part of the United Kingdom, the 2024 election left the prospect of another such poll dim. Labour rolled back into place as the most popular party in Scotland, picking up several of its target seats from the Scottish National Party (SNP). The pro-independence\u00a0 group has dominated Scottish politics for a generation, and had won the most seats in three consecutive Westminster elections. But the SNP has suffered a torrid period in the last two years, cycling through three leaders in that time. And Labour, a pro-union party, capitalized on that trend, winning seats in Edinburgh and across southern Scotland. The Lib Dems also grabbed a handful of seats from the SNP, which may be left with fewer than ten seats. They won 48 at the last election, and became Britain\u2019s third largest party. The SNP still controls the Scottish Parliament, a devolved body that holds separate elections. The next election for the Scottish Parliament doesn\u2019t have to take place until 2026. But the party\u2019s majority in Holyrood is very narrow, and they are in a deeply diminished position after Thursday\u2019s vote. It means they cannot now meaningfully push for another independence referendum, which they would need the permission of the Westminster government to hold. The once very real possibility of Scotland breaking from its centuries-long but occasionally awkward union with England, Wales and Northern Ireland will likely now be shelved for a generation. Green Party quadruples its seat number \u2013 to four It was a very good night for the Green Party which won four seats in the Parliament, three more seats compared to the last election in 2019. While the party stood candidates in a record number of constituencies in this election, its official goal was to win four seats. The Greens succeeded in all four. They won comfortably in Brighton Pavilion, their long-time and, until now, only stronghold. But they also managed to take two seats away from the Conservatives, in the traditionally rural constituencies of North Herefordshire and Waveney Valley. The Greens also won in Bristol Central, which was previously held by Labour seat. Anger over Labour\u2019s Gaza stance On a very positive night for the Labour Party, there were a handful of disappointments. Labour\u2019s shadow culture minister Thangam Debbonaire lost her seat to the Green Party, giving Starmer an early decision to make about a Cabinet post. But more troubling was the party\u2019s slideback in parts of the country with a large Muslim population, a continuation of a trend seen too in local elections since Israel\u2019s war against Hamas in Gaza began. Starmer\u2019s stance against Israel\u2019s military campaign has hardened over time but his initial, unequivocal defense of Israel\u2019s intervention in Gaza was criticized by some on Labour\u2019s left and has been exploited by the Greens and independents in some seats. Starmer has since called for a ceasefire and the return of Israeli hostages held by the militant group in the enclave. Shockat Adam beat senior Labour figure Jonathan Ashworth in a stunning upset, after campaigning mainly on the issue. Labour only narrowly defeated George Galloway in Rochdale, where Galloway did the same. Perhaps most shockingly of all, Labour\u2019s shadow health secretary Wes Streeting clung onto his seat by just 528 votes, after a strong challenge by British-Palestinian independent Leanne Mohamad. Labour will take extremely seriously the votes it lost across the country over the issue of Gaza. And a sizeable if disorganized throng of independents elected, in large part, over the issue may seek to unite to elevate their cause in Parliament.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/uk/uk-election-exit-poll-results-labour-conservative-starmer-gbr-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "world"}}

Hezbollah member Yasser Nemr Qranbish was killed\u00a0in an attack targeting him in an area west of the capital, Damascus, on the old Damascus-Beirut road, the group added, without providing further details. No group has yet claimed responsibility for the strike. The Israeli military said in a statement Tuesday that the Israeli Air Force \u201cstruck Hezbollah terrorist infrastructure in the area of Qabrikha from which the projectiles were launched toward the area of the Golan Heights.\u201d \u201cIn addition, the IAF struck Hezbollah military structures in the area of Kfarkela in southern Lebanon,\u201d the IDF statement added. Cross-border fire between Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah has been an almost daily occurrence since the war in Gaza began. But it has been gradually intensifying, raising fears it could escalate into a full-blown conflict. Hezbollah is one of the most powerful paramilitary forces in the Middle East, with tens of thousands of fighters and a vast missile arsenal. The group has said its current round of fighting with Israel is to support Palestinians in Gaza. Smotrich extended condolences to the families of those killed and said the Israeli military and government should \u201crestore security\u201d for residents of the Golan Heights. \u201cThe time has come for courage and valor also from the leadership of the IDF and the state of Israel, and as I have been demanding for a long time, to strike Hezbollah and Lebanon mercilessly and restore security to the residents of the North,\u201d said Smotrich, who also holds a position in the Defense Ministry, in a statement on Tuesday night. Former Israeli war cabinet member Benny Gantz also commented on the attack, saying it was \u201conce again a difficult and sad evening.\u201d \u201cThe operative effort should have been transferred to the North in March, as we demanded. Prime Minister Netanyahu hesitated, and refused to add the return of the residents of the north to their homes by September 1 to the objectives of the war \u2013 and we are paying the price. And that price is heavy,\u201d said Gantz, who resigned from Netanyahu\u2019s government in June.

{"id": "2024_07_09_weather_hurricane-season-forecast-beryl-climate", "text": "Beryl just smashed all expectations of what an early season hurricane could become, and it has experts concerned for what could be coming next. Typically, early season storms aren\u2019t indicative of what\u2019s\u00a0to come later in the season because the necessary atmospheric conditions for powerful storms aren\u2019t yet in place. But Beryl broke the mold. \u201cNormally, early-season storm activity doesn\u2019t tell us much about what is going to happen the rest of the time,\u201d Phil Klotzbach, a hurricane expert and research scientist at Colorado State University, told CNN. \u201cBut when storms are strong in the tropical Atlantic and eastern Caribbean, it tends to be a harbinger of a very busy season.\u201d The busiest part of Atlantic hurricane season doesn\u2019t typically begin until mid-August and peaks in September, but Beryl \u2013 which initially formed in late June \u2013 behaved like it already arrived.\u00a0The water Beryl raced through was as warm as it should be in September, so it behaved like a September hurricane. It\u2019s something forecasters warned could happen even before the season got underway. \u201cBeryl confirms what we thought about (this) season, that given the extremely warm (water) temperatures that we currently have, we could experience mid-season-type storms earlier than normal,\u201d Klotzbach said. Ocean temperatures in the Atlantic basin remain historically warm and have been for more than a year, particularly where Beryl first became a hurricane. Warm oceans are a major consequence of a world warming due to fossil fuel pollution and provide the fuel for tropical systems to explode in strength at a breakneck pace. Beryl rapidly intensified faster than any other storm on record this early in the season when its winds increased by 65 mph in just 24 hours, according to Klotzbach. Rapid intensification is becoming more likely as the climate crisis advances. \u201cBeryl\u2019s early and rapid intensification is indicative of the types of extreme weather events we may see more frequently in a warming world,\u201d according to Mona Hemmati, a postdoctoral research scientist at Columbia University\u2019s Climate School. Beryl \u201cencapsulates many of the fears scientists have for this hurricane season,\u201d Hemmati told CNN. The storm took advantage of extremely warm waters and eventually strengthened into the Atlantic\u2019s earliest Category 5 hurricane on record \u2013 one of several milestones no other early July hurricane has reached. Forecasters increase hurricane season predictions after Beryl Beryl\u2019s unprecedented performance only solidified a chorus of expert voices \u2013 including Klotzbach\u2019s team at Colorado State \u2013 who called for a hyperactive hurricane season well before the first three named storms \u2013 Alberto, Beryl and Chris \u2013 formed. \u201cThis early season activity is a likely warning sign that things are going to be very busy once we move closer to the peak of the season,\u201d Klotzbach cautioned. Klotzbach\u2019s group of forecasters at Colorado State increased the number of named storms, hurricanes and major hurricanes expected this season in an update to their hurricane season forecast Tuesday. They now predict the Atlantic season will have 25 named storms including 12 hurricanes, half of which will become major hurricanes of at least Category 3 strength. The forecast also relies on a burgeoning La Ni\u00f1a that should ease wind shear \u2013 the change in wind speed or direction at different heights in the atmosphere \u2013 over the Atlantic. High levels of wind shear can tear apart an active storm or prevent one from forming in the first place. Without it, more storms could form and strengthen. But extremely warm water will stick around through the peak of hurricane season and storms could take full advantage of it to overcome wind shear, just like Beryl did. The extremely warm water kept Beryl incredibly strong, even in the face of disruptive wind shear that should have weakened it considerably. This also happened during last year\u2019s hurricane season when El Ni\u00f1o brought increased wind shear but incredibly warm water still helped 20 named storms form. For now, a brief pause in Atlantic tropical activity is expected over the next week or two due in part to a large area of dry, dusty air and some bouts of moderately disruptive wind shear. Plumes of dry air filled with Saharan dust traveling across the Atlantic from Africa are typical around this time of year. It can sometimes even reach the United States and help produce stunning sunsets. But dry, dusty air isn\u2019t\u00a0a friend to tropical systems. It cuts off the moisture a system needs to survive, so the National Hurricane Center isn\u2019t highlighting any areas to watch for tropical development over the next week. When the break will end and the busiest part of hurricane season will get underway is the \u201cmillion dollar question,\u201d according to Klotzbach. Tropical activity could ramp up again later in July or hold off until August depending on how several atmospheric factors play out in the next couple of weeks, he told CNN. Either way, with such an extreme ocean heat to tap into, Beryl proved the door is wide open for a prolific season.

{"id": "2024_06_25_style_paris-2024-olympic-village", "text": "When Paris last hosted the Summer Olympics 100 years ago, organizers were so keen to bring athletes under the same roof that they built the first-ever Olympic Village. It was spartan, made up of furnished wood huts, and it was razed shortly after. The competition is back in the City of Lights a century later, but French officials are doing something completely different this time around. As part of their effort to make Paris 2024 the \u201cmost responsible and sustainable games in history,\u201d they\u2019re building something that\u2019s meant to last. \u201cThis village was thought up as a neighborhood, a neighborhood that is going to have a life afterwards,\u201d said Georgina Grenon, the Paris 2024 director of sustainability. \u201cParis 2024 is renting it for a few months.\u201d Instead of rooming in apartments tailor-made for them, athletes in the Olympic Village this summer will be living in what will become someone else\u2019s home or workplace. Once the Paralympics have finished on September 8, the village \u2014 which contains 82 buildings \u2014 will be converted into office space for 6,000 workers and apartments to house another 6,000 people. The hope is that the project will provide a model to alleviate a housing crisis in the French capital, where rising interest rates, surging prices and a supply crunch have made it harder than ever to buy or rent a home. Demand for affordable housing is so intense that when a small 10 square meter (108 square feet) apartment in Paris\u2019 up-and-coming 10th arrondissement hit the rental market last year at a price of 610 euros ($614) per month, it attracted a staggering 765 applicants in less than a week. The site for the Olympic Village was chosen in the hopes it would revitalize some of the city\u2019s historically impoverished northern suburbs. The village lies at the juncture of three suburbs: Saint-Denis, a diverse, working-class neighborhood long associated with crime and insecurity; the rapidly gentrifying Saint-Ouen; and Ile-Saint-Denis, an island on the Seine River. Organizers say post-Olympics, 32% of the new homes in Saint-Denis and Saint-Ouen, and 48% of those in Ile-Saint-Denis built for the Games will be set aside for public housing. There\u2019s a risk, however, that current residents could be priced out. Similar pledges to build affordable housing in east London were made in advance of the 2012 Olympics, but those promises ended up largely falling flat. A BBC report in 2022 found that of the 9,000 homes built within the Olympic Park, less than 200 were offered at the cheapest levels of rent. \u2018It\u2019s a huge test lab\u2019 Like the Olympics themselves \u2014 which organizers say will run 100% on renewable energy \u2014 everything built for the village was done with sustainability in mind. To minimize the amount of construction, organizers temporarily or permanently retrofitted several existing structures on the site, including an old electric factory that\u2019s been turned into a \u201cresident center.\u201d They also rented existing movie studios in the area to be used as training facilities for athletes instead of building new training facilities which has been done at some other Games. The buildings that were erected were built with wood and recycled materials, employing processes that, according to Grenon, reduced the project\u2019s carbon footprint by 30% per square meter \u2014 more than French ecological regulations require. A third of all the rooftops are equipped with solar panels, while another third have gardens meant to bring down the temperature inside, Grenon said. And long, straight openings leading to the Seine were left in between the buildings to form wind tunnels carrying the fresh air near the river as far inland as possible. Temperatures this summer are expected to be warmer than normal, according to France\u2019s national weather service, and there is widespread concern heat could jeopardize athlete safety. But the structures themselves aren\u2019t the only thing that will be recycled. The village will house about 3,000 apartments containing a total of 14,250 beds made with recyclable materials similar to the ones used in Tokyo. The mattresses were manufactured with reused materials and their firmness can be adjusted by flipping them over. Stools were made with cardboard meaning they can be easily recycled after the Olympics. Across the village, organizers are running a handful of experiments to see if new green technologies and construction methods are viable in the real world. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge test lab,\u201d Grenon said. One sidewalk has been made with seashells. In theory, those shells are supposed to absorb rain. On hot days, the stored water should evaporate and help cool passers-by. The village\u2019s main drag features five experimental outdoor air filters. These giant, UFO-like towers are designed like vacuums to suck in the polluted air and filter out dangerous particles. The device can clean \u201c95% of the air of the particulate matter \u2014 all sizes,\u201d its creator, Jerome Giacomoni, told CNN. The five devices can clean the equivalent of the volume of 40 Olympic-sized swimming pools an hour with very little electricity consumption, Giacomoni said. Keeping cool The most scrutinized innovation will likely be the geothermal cooling system, as athletes in Paris could face the same level of sweltering heat and humidity that broiled Tokyo during the Summer Olympics there three years ago. \u201cClimate change should increasingly be viewed as an existential threat to sport,\u201d Sebastian Coe, the president of World Athletics, said in a report published last week (June 18) examining the heat risks associated with this summer\u2019s games. While the ground floor of some buildings in the Olympic Village are equipped with traditional air conditioning because they will be converted into shops after the Olympics, the athlete apartments will use geothermal cooling instead of air conditioning. This system takes water cooled to 4 degrees Celsius (39 degrees Fahrenheit) from wells as deep as 70 meters (230 feet) underground at a nearby geothermal plant and transports them to pipes under the floors of each apartment. That cold water should be able to cool the building by 6 to 10 degrees Celsius compared to the temperature outside, according to Laurent Michaud, the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Village director. While the system will be controlled at the building level, each apartment has a thermostat that allows them to lower or raise the temperature by 2 degrees Celsius in each unit. The system will also heat apartments in the winter. The human-caused climate crisis has made heat waves more frequent and intense, and they are starting earlier in the year in many parts of the world. Paris is particularly vulnerable \u2014 people in the French capital are more likely to die from extreme heat than any other city in Europe, a study that looked at more than 850 cities showed. As of 2022, just 19% of all households in Europe were equipped with air conditioning, according to the most recent figures from the International Energy Agency. But extreme heat across the world has driven up global demand for AC units, creating a climate Catch-22, as air conditioning systems use large amounts of energy, much of which still comes from fossil fuels that emit carbon dioxide and heats the planet. For delegations concerned about the system\u2019s efficacy during a heat wave, the village will offer them the option to rent individual air conditioning units. Asked about the lack of air conditioning in the Village by news agency Reuters in March, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo said the village was \u201cdesigned to avoid the need for air conditioning, even in very, very high temperatures.\u201d \u201cWe are on the brink of a precipice. Everyone, including the athletes, must be aware of this,\u201d Hidalgo said. \u201cWe have to trust the scientists when they help us to construct buildings in a sober way that allows us to make do without air conditioning.\u201d CNN\u2019s Saskya Vandoorne and Derek Van Dam contributed to this report", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/style/paris-2024-olympic-village/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_09_asia_korea-ac130j-ghostrider-gunship-biggest-gun-intl-hnk-ml", "text": "As the US Air Force AC-130J flies over South Korea\u2019s towering apartment blocks, its powerful cameras can almost see inside\u00a0windows on the highest floors. Aiming farther afield, the weapons officers on the four-engine aircraft, nicknamed Ghostrider, can pick out objects at 50,000 feet, almost 10 miles away \u2013 all potential targets for the biggest gun ever mounted on a fixed-wing plane. CNN got an exclusive look inside the aircraft, assigned to Air Force Special Operations Command, in early June after it flew from its home base in Hurlburt Field, Florida, for joint drills in South Korea. In a live-fire exercise, the 105-millimeter howitzer pumped out 43-pound shells, into a firing range east of Seoul, the force of each blast so powerful that it pushed the tail of the 80-ton plane six feet to the right. About eight seconds after firing, the shells hit the range 10,000 feet below, sending smoke billowing skyward as the controllers of the big gun watched the results of their handiwork on large video screens in the middle of the aircraft. \u201cAssess two tanks destroyed,\u201d a scratchy voice confirms in the radio headsets of the AC-130 crew. Pilot Capt. John Ikenberry said the AC-130\u2019s presence for drills in South Korea was designed to send a simple message to its belligerent neighbor North Korea and its leader Kim Jong Un. \u201cIt shows we are ready,\u201d Ikenberry said. Tensions have been simmering on the peninsula in recent months. The North has been sending balloons filled with trash to areas in and near Seoul and testing missiles, and South Korean troops have fired warning shots as North Korean soldiers from the North have crossed the military demarcation line in the middle of the demilitarized zone. Just this week, North Korea criticized live-fire exercises in the South in late June and early July as an \u201c\u2018inexcusable and explicit provocation.\u201d Meanwhile, Washington has kept a steady stream of hardware heading to the South for land, air and sea exercises leading up to one of their biggest yearly exercises, Ulchi Freedom Shield, set to begin later this summer. Experience they can\u2019t get stateside The AC-130J, the newest version of the US Air Force Hercules gunships, is testing its mettle in Korea for the second year in a row. Maj. Heath Curtis, combat systems officer on the Hercules, says it\u2019s important for the gunship to make the flight across the Pacific because it offers experience training where a conflict could be fought with conditions that can\u2019t be duplicated on firing ranges in Florida or New Mexico that the gunship would use in the United States. The mountain ranges and ridges of the Korean Peninsula present wind conditions not found elsewhere, he says, and that can make a difference even to a projectile traveling more than 800 mph. It also gives the chance for Curtis and a second officer seated at AC-130\u2019s weapons control center the chance to practice alongside South Korean allies they may need to protect in the event of a ground war on the peninsula. The huge television monitors bring the battlefield below up close in both regular and infrared definition. The cameras mounted outside the plane can zoom in on details to ensure weapons fire is accurate. \u201cThe unique thing about the AC-130 is the amount of fire that we bring, the amount of munitions \u2013 the diverse amount of them \u2013 and the amount of loiter time we can provide,\u201d says the mission commander for this gunship, Maj. Josh Burris. Besides the 105-millimeter howitzer, the AC-130J carries a 30-millimeter cannon and can launch precision-guided missiles and bombs from pylons on its wings. With the weapons\u2019 near-pinpoint accuracy, it can fire on enemy positions within shouting distance of friendly troops, earning the aircraft the title of \u201cthe infantryman\u2019s best friend\u201d in some circles. And with air-to-air refueling, it can, in theory, stay on station supporting ground forces as long as the crew and ammunition can last. \u2018Spooky\u2019 history US Air Force gunships trace their lineage back to the Vietnam War, when the service set up 7.62 mm guns to fire out one side of a C-47 transport aircraft. With that configuration, the aircraft could circle a single point and deliver massive, continuous firepower on it, from its guns that could fire 6,000 rounds in a minute, according to Air Force fact sheets. The firepower and the flares they used to light up targets during night missions earned them the nicknames \u201cSpooky\u201d and \u201cPuff the Magic Dragon.\u201d As the war went on, the Air Force looked for a heavier airframe for the gunship role and turned to C-130 Hercules transports. The first conversion of a C-130 to an AC-130 saw action over Southeast Asia in 1967, according to the National Museum of the US Air Force. With their ability to support troops in close combat, AC-130 gunships in different variations have seen action in conflicts including Grenada, Panama, Somalia, Iraq and Afghanistan and have saved an untold number of lives, according to the Air Force. With the AC-130J model, introduced in 2017, the Air Force removed the machine guns in favor of the more precision-guided munitions. But there have been problems, too, including a 2015 attack on a Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) hospital in Kunduz, Afghanistan, that killed left 42 patients, staff and caretakersdead. Despite the formidable firepower it carries, the AC-130 flies low and slow, making it vulnerable to anti-aircraft fire. And seven AC-130 gunships have been lost over the years, the last being on January 31, 1991, when an Iraqi surface-to-air missile brought down a AC-130H during Operation Desert Storm, according to Air Force news releases. The plane crashed into the Persian Gulf while supporting US Marines during a battle in Khafji, Saudi Arabia, killing all 14 crew aboard. The AC-130\u2019s crew acknowledges the dangers of ground fire to their aircraft, and some analysts question its usefulness in any potential conflict with North Korea. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t be operated within say 100 nautical miles of the border as they\u2019re too vulnerable to North Korean border air defenses,\u201d says Peter Layton, a visiting fellow at the Griffith Asia Institute in Australia and former Royal Australian Air Force officer. But Layton says the gunships could be helpful supporting allied troops who might be trying to round up North Korean special forces units that had managed to infiltrate deeper into southern territory. Still, he cautioned, \u201cif a war starts there, try not to be on an AC-130 unless it\u2019s heading out of theater.\u201d Maj. Christopher Mesnard, Special Operations Command Korea public affairs director, said the AC-130J is a suitable weapon system for the Korean Peninisula. \u201cWe have the utmost confidence in our ability to operate weapons systems\u00a0\u200blike the AC-130J in times and places of our choosing and in a way that adequately considers risks, regardless of the region,\u201d he said.

{"id": "2024_06_12_style_fumihiko-maki-architect-dies", "text": "Tokyo (AP) \u2014 Japanese architect Fumihiko Maki, who won the prestigious Pritzker Prize for designs praised as smartly and artfully fusing the East with the West, has died. He was 95. Maki, who taught architecture and urban design at Harvard, died June 6, his office, Maki & Associates, said Wednesday. Japanese media reports attributed the cause of death to old age. The office declined to confirm the reports. The National Museum of Modern Art in Kyoto is considered one of his classic designs, with floating forms of glass, metal and concrete. Its gray exterior appears simple at first glance but sets off patterns of reflected light on rough and polished marble. In the U.S., Maki\u2019s projects included the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco and 4 World Trade Center in New York. He also did the Makuhari Messe exhibition hall in Chiba, Japan, and the Hillside Terrace Complex in Tokyo. Maki in the 1980s designed Tokyo\u2019s Spiral building, whose management mourned his death and thanked him for \u201cthe beautiful slopes and the rich space that envisioned an urban park.\u201d In 2013, Maki\u00a0complained about the then planned spaceship-like design\u00a0of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics stadium, slamming it as too expensive and clashing with its surroundings. He said he had the support 100 other people, including architects, in opposing the size of the proposed design by British-Iraqi architect Zaha Hadid. \u201cThe problems I see with the planned stadium all relate to the issue of scale,\u201d he said.That design was eventually ditched for a more modest-looking design by\u00a0Kengo Kuma\u00a0which used pieces of wood for a natural Japanese look. Born in Tokyo in 1928, Maki was educated at the University of Tokyo, the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Michigan and Harvard University Graduate School of Design. Before opening his own design firm in 1965 in Tokyo, he worked in various offices including Skidmore Owings and Merrill, or SOM, based in Chicago, and Sert, Jackson & Associates in Cambridge, as well as the campus planning office of Washington University in St. Louis. A devoted educator, Maki, in addition to teaching at Washington University, Harvard and the University of Tokyo, lectured around the world. His essays were published in a collection called \u201cNurturing Dreams\u201d by MIT Press in 2008. In it, he explored the Japanese sense of space called \u201coku,\u201d which Maki described as \u201cthe core of this high-density space organized into multiple layers like an onion.\u201d Utilizing oku allowed the Japanese to deliver a feeling of depth even in a cramped area, according to this theory. \u201cIn the formation of urban space, certain stable concepts that have been sifted and committed to memory by the collective unconscious of the community work automatically,\u201d Maki wrote. \u201cOku, a spatial concept peculiar to Japan, is a good example, and I believe an understanding of this way of perceiving space is important in formulating ideas of what future cities should be like.\u201d Maki was the second Japanese to win the Pritzker, hailed as the Nobel Prize of architecture, after Kenzo Tange, his mentor. Maki, along with fellow Tange students\u00a0Arata Isozaki\u00a0and\u00a0Kisho Kurokawa, were the pillars of Japanese modernism. The Pritzker, in selecting Maki, praised him as part of a new wave of architects rebuilding postwar Japan. \u201cHe uses light in a masterful way making it as tangible a part of every design as are the walls and roof. In each building, he searches for a way to make transparency, translucency and opacity exist in total harmony. He uses detail to give his structures rhythm and scale,\u201d Bill Lacy, a member of the international panel of jurors that selected Maki, said at the time. Maki was honored with other awards, such as the Wolf Prize from Israel in 1988 and the Arnold Brunner Prize from the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1999. In 2011, the American Institute of Architects honored Maki with its highest accolade, the AIA Gold Medal. Japanese media reports said a memorial service was planned.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met Russian President Vladimir Putin at his residence in Novo-Ogaryovo outside Moscow on Monday, while less than 600 miles away Russian missiles rained down on Ukrainian cities in a morning rush hour assault that killed\u00a0at least 39 people. Modi\u2019s two-day trip marks his first visit to Russia since Putin began his full-scale invasion of Ukraine nearly two and a half years ago, with images and video Monday showing the two leaders hugging, chatting over tea, riding in an electric vehicle and watching a horse show. \u201cIt is a huge disappointment and a devastating blow to peace efforts to see the leader of the world\u2019s largest democracy hug the world\u2019s most bloody criminal in Moscow on such a day,\u201d Zelensky said in a post on X on Monday, referring to the deadly Russian attacks. Modi did not address the strikes directly during a meeting with Putin at the Kremlin on Tuesday though he did say solutions to conflict are unlikely to come through war, but rather peace and dialogue. \u201cWhether it\u2019s conflict war or terror, any person who believes in humanity is troubled when there are deaths, especially when innocent children die,\u201d Modi told reporters while seated alongside the Russian president, appearing to deliver his most critical comments to date against Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine. \u201cAs a friend, I have always said that peace is necessary for the prosperity of future generations, but I also know that on the battlefield, solutions aren\u2019t easy to come by between guns, bombs and bullets. We have to adopt a path to peace through dialogue,\u201d Modi said. The Indian prime minister said the \u201cworld is watching this current visit and interpreting it in various ways.\u201d He added: \u201cIndia is ready to support you in every possible way to achieve peace. I assure you and the world that we are in favor of peace and, after talking to my friend Putin yesterday, I have hope.\u201d Modi said the two leaders had discussed Ukraine when he made a five-hour visit to Putin\u2019s Novo-Ogaryovo residence late Monday. Putin also confirmed to reporters Tuesday that the pair had discussed Ukraine, thanking Modi for his attempts to find a solution to the conflict. Earlier Tuesday, Modi praised relations between the two countries while addressing the Indian diaspora in Moscow. He also announced the opening of two new consulates in the Russian cities of Yekaterinburg and Kazan to \u201cfacilitate travel and business.\u201d \u201cNo matter if the temperatures in Russia are in minus, Russia-India friendship has always been in plus,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a relationship built on a foundation of mutual trust and mutual respect.\u201d The large-scale daylight bombardment struck\u00a0the capital Kyiv, and cities including Dnipro, Kryvyi Rih, Slovyansk and Kramatorsk \u2013 some of which are heavily populated areas far from the front lines. In Kyiv, 29 people were killed, according to Ukrainian Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko on Tuesday. Two people were killed and at least 16 others were injured in the strike on Kyiv\u2019s\u00a0Okhmatdyt hospital. The facility is Ukraine\u2019s largest children\u2019s medical center and has been vital in the care of some of the sickest children from across the country. Videos from the scene showed volunteers working with police and security services to dig through the rubble as smoke billowed from the hospital. Search and rescue operations for people potentially trapped beneath the debris continued on Tuesday. Hospital staff said they tried to rush children to safety in the wake of the attack. Two children had been in the operating theaters at the time of the blast, and both were relocated to the basement shelter once their procedures were completed, a senior nurse told CNN. Another senior nurse said an operation on a 2-year-old was underway when the strike happened. \u201cThe lights went out, everything went out. We pulled out the instruments, shining flashlights. Everything was sewn up quickly,\u201d Iryna Filimonova said. \u201cThe baby was brought down (to the shelter). I immediately ran to help clear the rubble.\u201d United Nations human rights chief Volker Turk said the blast forced medical workers to treat sick children outside the facility. Patients were \u201creceiving treatment for cancer in hospital beds set up in parks and on streets, where medical workers had quickly established triage areas, amongst chaos, dust and debris,\u201d he said in a statement. Russia\u2019s defense ministry on Monday claimed that its forces struck \u201cmilitary industrial facilities of Ukraine and air bases of the Ukrainian armed forces,\u201d with long-range, high-precision weapons. Without providing evidence, the Russian ministry also claimed that photos and videos from the hospital blast confirmed the damage was caused by a Ukrainian air defense missile. Modi\u2019s Russia visit Meanwhile, in the Russian capital on Tuesday, Putin and Modi held official talks at the Kremlin. Earlier in the day, they visited an exhibition center hosting a pavilion on the nuclear industry, according to Russian state news agency TASS. Putin had welcomed the Indian leader to his Novo-Ogaryovo residence late Monday, where the Russian president greeted him as a \u201cdear friend\u201d and said he was \u201cvery happy\u201d to see him, TASS reported. Modi thanked Putin for hosting him at his suburban property, saying in a post on X: \u201cLooking forward to our talks tomorrow as well, which will surely go a long way in further cementing the bonds of friendship between India and Russia.\u201d The trip is a sign that New Delhi and Moscow remain close despite Russia\u2019s deepening dependence on China and is widely seen as the latest dent in efforts by Western leaders to cast Putin aside. India has longstanding ties to Moscow and\u00a0remains heavily reliant on the Kremlin for its military equipment. It has ramped up purchases of discounted Russian crude oil, giving Putin\u2019s nation a major financial lifeline as it faces isolation from the West. Ahead of the visit, a statement from Modi\u2019s office said the Indian leader would review \u201call aspects of bilateral cooperation with my friend President Vladimir Putin and sharing perspectives on various regional and global issues. We seek to play a supportive role for a peaceful and stable region.\u201d The United States has raised concerns with India about its relationship with Russia, a US State Department spokesperson told reporters in a media briefing Monday. \u201cI will look to Prime Minister Modi\u2019s public remarks to see what he talked about, but as I said, we made quite clear directly with India our concerns about their relationship with Russia,\u201d spokesperson Matthew Miller said. \u201cWe would hope India and any other country, when they engage with Russia, would make clear that Russia should respect the UN Charter, should respect Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity.\u201d While India has called for a cessation of hostilities in Ukraine and restoration of peace, it has also abstained from all resolutions on Ukraine at the United Nations and stopped short of condemning Russia\u2019s invasion. Trade between the two countries was worth nearly $65 billion in 2023-24, primarily due to strong energy cooperation,\u00a0but most of that total flowed toward Russia, according to India\u2019s foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal. Reducing the trade imbalance would be a \u201cmatter of priority\u201d in Modi\u2019s discussions with Putin, he said, ahead of the trip. The visit is also Modi\u2019s first bilateral trip since winning a rare third term in India\u2019s mammoth elections last month. Russian Presidential Aide Yury Ushakov said the Kremlin attaches \u201cprimary importance\u201d to Modi\u2019s visit, Russian state-run news agency TASS reported. The Russian attacks in Ukraine came a day before\u00a0US President Joe Biden\u00a0hosts a crucial NATO summit in Washington, where new announcements over the alliance\u2019s military, political and financial support for Kyiv are expected. Biden called Russian missile strikes in Kyiv\u00a0\u2013 including on the children\u2019s hospital \u2013 a \u201chorrific reminder of Russia\u2019s brutality,\u201d in a statement Monday evening. \u201cIt is critical that the world continues to stand with\u00a0Ukraine\u00a0at this important moment and that we not ignore Russian aggression,\u201d Biden said.

{"id": "style_mousganistan-mous-lamrabat-book-spc", "text": "There\u2019s a story that artist Mous Lamrabat likes to tell, about when he first became obsessed with brands. He was 14, a teenager born in Morocco and living with his family in Belgium. Lamrabat and his eight siblings were working class kids who wore plain clothes, long before plain clothes were adopted by the quiet luxury crowd and thus became cool. Back then, the cool kids, they were covered in logos; symbols of a club he desperately wanted to be a part of. \u201cAs a kid, you just want to belong,\u201d he remembered. So the teenager took a hat his father wore to mosque and embroidered it with a Nike swoosh. With needle and thread and a logo born 5,000 miles away, the people\u2019s republic of Mousganistan was founded. \u201cMousganistan,\u201d a manifesto, an exhibition title, and now the name of Lamrabat\u2019s first book, is a \u201cutopia of multiculturalism and unconditional belonging.\u201d It is, as all utopias are, more an idea than a place. It acknowledges all the identities we wear through life, and says, \u201cit\u2019s ok to not be one person,\u201d explained Lamrabat, now 41. We think we have to decide which person to be in any given moment, he added; \u201cAmerican\u201d outside the home, Arab inside, for example. Mousganistan says, \u201cIt\u2019s fine. Let\u2019s be both.\u201d This idea has guided Lamrabat\u2019s photography for years, manifested in sign and symbol. Lamrabat rose to prominence by melding Western iconography \u2014 especially its symbols of consumerism \u2014 with people and places from Africa and the Middle East. His work combines gauche branding with fine-art sensibilities, operating as a cultural melting pot ripe with playful contrast. In Mousganistan, a Tuareg tagelmust (headscarf) is made from Ikea bag straps, women sport henna Wu-Tang Clan logos, and niqabs look like Lakers and Bulls jerseys. Because why not? They are, at their core, heightened reflections of the cultural osmosis and lived experience of millions of people every day. The mischievousness is the point. But as his profile has risen, has Lamrabat run into any issues with the companies his artworks co-opt? \u201cNever,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of the time, I\u2019m contacted by these brands or creative directors to congratulate me. They\u2019re a big fan.\u201d \u201cIn a way, I\u2019m still thinking, \u2018Hey, hire me,\u2019\u201d he added, laughing. Some have. The Belgian Moroccan artist shot a campaign for WhatsApp, has had work appear on the cover of Vogue and Esquire, and been profiled by GQ. But there have also been lean periods, he admits, and a year when he didn\u2019t pick up a camera. He\u2019s hustled and hustled, he explained, using friends as models and never working with big budgets (\u201cthis actually made my work stronger\u201d). His debut monograph spans eight years of work \u2014 a long time, and a long time coming, as he admits he put off the project for years. \u201cIt felt like so much work \u2026 Now that I\u2019ve made the book, I realized that was true,\u201d Lamrabat joked. But he recognizes it as a big moment: \u201cEverything that I\u2019ve done so far led me to the point I\u2019m at now.\u201d Unsurprisingly, one word has followed Lamrabat around: iconoclastic. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what iconoclastic means,\u201d he said, chuckling. \u201cI\u2019ve always lived in a bubble and created in a bubble. It was only when I started doing interviews that people started (mentioning this).\u201d Lamrabat concedes he\u2019s no art connoisseur, though he is a lover of fashion, where \u201csymbols are so important lately.\u201d He describes influencers proudly displaying even the most throwaway items adorned with brand logos on social media. \u201cI almost feel like (fashion has) become a kind of religion by itself. Like a cult.\u201d His art hasn\u2019t shied away from religion, particularly the flowing fabrics of Islamic womenswear. Bright and bold (in part, a result of an eye condition limiting Lamrabat\u2019s color sight), these playful interpretations nevertheless read as respectful of his heritage. (Perhaps his most provocative work, of a veiled model wearing a Make America Great Again cap, titled \u201cI Just Did,\u201d was not intended to be read as explicitly religious, he noted.) More recently, Lamrabat has taken to draping fabrics over models for a more secular interpretation that focuses on silhouette and the quality of the textile. He explained he wanted to remove the attracting but distracting presence of faces from his work. The idea came to him after a tough period in which he wasn\u2019t proud of much of his output. \u201cMe and my girlfriend (now fianc\u00e9) were driving through the desert and it was so beautiful,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI wanted to make it so simple; something pure. We shot one photo and it looked amazing.\u201d He began singling out more interesting fabrics and giving them focus, \u201ccreating fashion without fashion.\u201d Doing so rekindled childhood memories. \u201cWhen I was little, my parents gifted fabrics, which I never understood,\u201d Lamrabat said. \u201cWhy would you not at least give them a dress or something, you know?\u201d But he grew to learn of their significance, and the stories these fabrics tell, and how cherished they were by his own culture and others. Lamrabat has found other ways to manifest the personal in his work. He is Amazigh, North African tribespeople with a flag comprised of three horizontal stripes: blue top, green middle, yellow bottom, representing sky, mountains and desert. Over the stripes is a red letter in the Tifinagh language, symbolizing resistance, that also looks like a human figure, head in the sky, feet in the sand. \u201cIf you look at all of my photos, almost all of them, there\u2019s blue behind the head,\u201d he explained. \u201cThat\u2019s why I like shooting outside.\u201d Despite all these throughlines in his work, Lamrabat\u2019s book possibly closes a chapter of his life. \u201cMaybe everything until now was Mousganistan,\u201d he said, \u201cme trying to find solutions for different worlds we live in.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m at a crossroads,\u201d he shared, \u201cand I need to make a decision (about) what\u2019s next.\u201d As daunting as that may sound, he has some ideas \u2014 none of which involve photography. \u201cI\u2019m not a photographer,\u201d he insisted. \u201cThe camera is just a creative output for my ideas \u2026 I want to try to not always think in photography, if that makes sense.\u201d He\u2019s wary of any endeavor that limits his creative freedom. \u201cThere should be no rules when it comes to the creative industry,\u201d he argued, and bemoaned artists \u201closing our rawness\u201d in commercial work, rife as it is with polish and compromise. He floats getting into sculpture, although he\u2019s not sure where to begin. Let the practical details follow; Lamrabat has always been an ideas guy anyway, and that\u2019s not going to change any time soon. \u201cWhat Mousganistan is, is a big construction of bridges,\u201d he said. \u201cI would love to keep doing that, because I truly feel that if we focus on the things that we have in common instead of the differences, it can bring a lot of people closer together.\u201d \u201cMousganistan\u201d is available to buy now.", "source": "http://cnn.com/style/mousganistan-mous-lamrabat-book-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "travel_ramesh-shukla-dubai-uae-royal-photographer-hnk-spc-intl", "text": "\u201cI am not famous \u2014 my camera is very famous. This camera.\u201d Ramesh Shukla pulls out a Rolleicord camera, a birthday gift from his father 70 years ago. It\u2019s the same camera he left India with in 1965; the same one that has snapped photos of sheikhs and political leaders; the same one that captured the formation of a nation. Now 85, Shukla has told and retold his life story so many times that the details are hard to pin down, mythologized into a series of essential moments that tell the tale of a plucky adventurer setting sail in search of fortune and opportunity. As he tells it, the then-26-year-old photographer boarded a ship from Bombay (now Mumbai), to the Trucial States \u2014 now the United Arab Emirates (UAE), but at that time, a collection of independent Sheikhdoms along the eastern coast of the Arabian Peninsula. He arrived at the port in Sharjah with just a dollar in his pocket and a few rolls of film, and hitched a ride on a donkey cart, then a motorbike, to Dubai:\u00a0not the glittering metropolis it is today, but a dusty fishing village with no roads, surrounded by huge, open expanses of desert. \u201cIn my house there was no water, no electricity. It was very difficult,\u201d says Shukla. It didn\u2019t stop him from getting out and documenting the fisherfolk, pearl divers and camel drivers living in the small coastal settlement. But change was on the horizon. The Trucial States, while not a colony, were part of a \u201cBritish protectorate\u201d that was soon to end, and oil had only been discovered in the Arabian Gulf a few years earlier, with the first exports beginning to create wealth for the small Emirati population. And at that time, there were very few people in the region with the skill, technical knowledge and equipment to produce the quality of photography that Shukla could. His big break came when he attended a camel race in Sharjah in 1968. The sheikhs from the various emirates were in attendance that day, and Shukla snapped a photo of the group sitting along the side of the track. Among them was Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the late emir of Abu Dhabi, who is often referred to as the \u201cfounding father\u201d of the UAE. The next day, he returned to the racetrack and presented the photo to Sheikh Zayed, asking for his blessing \u2014\u00a0and it changed everything. \u201cWhen he saw the picture, Sheikh Zayed tells me, \u2018You are Fannan\u2019 (meaning \u201cartist\u201d in Arabic),\u201d says Shukla. Capturing history After the camel race, Shukla found himself invited to official events as a photographer, accessing places and people he could only have dreamed of a few years earlier. He developed a friendship with the royals, and Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum, ruler of Dubai until his death in 1990, encouraged him to stay in the Emirates \u2014\u00a0so in 1970, his wife and son joined him in Dubai. \u201cWhere I grew up, we had one room which was our living room, our kitchen and the dark room,\u201d explains Neel Shukla, Ramesh\u2019s son. \u201cWe had thalis, for the Indian way of eating food \u2014 it\u2019s a steel plate and you put your different vegetables and dal and roti on it. That same thali was used for eating and developing film.\u201d Neel recalls that resources were scarce \u2014\u00a0especially water, which was delivered by donkeys from wells in the desert. The water used to develop photos had to be precisely measured out, and Shukla\u2019s wife, Taru, played a vital role in her husband\u2019s work: while he was photographing events, she recorded technical notes that would impact how the pictures were developed later, such as the lighting, exposure and shutter speed. \u201cWithout my family, my wife and son, I couldn\u2019t do anything,\u201d Ramesh Shukla says. On December 2, 1971, Shukla was called to join a moment of huge historic significance for the region: the signing of the unification agreement that saw six of the emirates \u2014 Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Umm Al-Qaywayn, Fujairah and Ajman \u2014 come together as the United Arab Emirates. (Ras Al-Khaimah joined as the seventh emirate just two months later.) Shukla\u2019s photo of Sheikh Zayed signing the unification declaration is instantly recognizable for those in the country \u2014 even 50 years on, thanks to its use on the new 50 dirham note, printed in 2021 to celebrate the nation\u2019s 50th anniversary. A \u2018world-famous\u2019 camera Shukla continued to document Dubai and the Emirates through the 1970s, \u201880s and \u201890s, although he still has \u201chundreds\u201d of undeveloped rolls of film from this period. He\u2019s still developing them, releasing unseen images of the sheikhs in exhibitions every few years. In a bid to continue his legacy, Shukla \u2014\u00a0with the help of his son, Neel \u2014 has set up a darkroom lab to teach the next generation of Emirati photographers the technical skills of analog photography. The year-long \u201cmasterclass\u201d course, which will start in September this year for 10 students, is free through Dubai Culture, a government organization. Shukla hopes it will give young photographers a chance to gain skills that are being lost since the advent of digital photography. \u201cThey\u2019ll graduate under my father\u2019s mentorship, and they will have that standing from (being taught by) the Founding Fathers\u2019 photographer,\u201d says Neel Shukla. Over the years, Shukla\u2019s photography has been compiled into books and showcased in exhibitions as a vital witness to the formation of the country. While it\u2019s his name across the books and posters, he insists it was the Rolleicord that did all the work. \u201cI told my father, \u2018Papa, I will make this camera one day world-famous,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cThis is my dream.\u201d With millions of copies of his books distributed in the past few years alone, it\u2019s safe to say he achieved it.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/ramesh-shukla-dubai-uae-royal-photographer-hnk-spc-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "world"}}

The decision follows what the company described as a months-long inquiry into how the term has historically been used and how it is currently being used on social media, particularly as the war in Gaza continues. \u201cWe have determined that the existing policy guidance does not sufficiently address the ways people are using the term \u2018Zionist\u2019\u00a0online and offline,\u201d Meta said in\u00a0a blog post. \u201cGoing forward, we will remove content attacking \u2018Zionists\u2019\u00a0when it is not explicitly about the political movement, but instead uses antisemitic stereotypes, or threatens other types of harm through intimidation, or violence directed against Jews or Israelis under the guise of attacking Zionists.\u201d The new approach recognizes that the term \u201cZionist\u201d \u2014 which, narrowly construed, refers to the political movement promoting the creation of a Jewish state \u2014 is sometimes used as an epithet by opponents of Israel.

{"id": "2024_07_08_europe_ukraine-russian-strike-childrens-hospital-intl", "text": "A Russian missile strike partially destroyed a children\u2019s hospital in Kyiv on Monday, causing terrified patients and their families to flee for their lives. Moscow launched a brazen daytime aerial assault on targets in cities across Ukraine during morning rush hour, killing at least 43 people, according to the latest figures released by authorities on Tuesday. Search and rescue operations continued into Tuesday after the large-scale bombardment struck the capital, as well as in Dnipro, Kryvyi Rih, Slovyansk and Kramatorsk. The death toll includes 33 people in Kyiv, Ukrainian interior minister Ihor Klymenko said in an update Tuesday. Earlier, Ukraine\u2019s State Emergency Service said four children were among the dead after a boy\u2019s body was found under the rubble in the capital\u2019s Shevchenkivskyi district. Two people were killed and at least 16 others injured in the strike on Kyiv\u2019s Okhmatdyt hospital. The facility is Ukraine\u2019s largest children\u2019s medical center and has been vital in the care of some of the sickest children from across the country. Every year, around 7,000 surgeries \u2013 including treatments for cancer and hematological diseases \u2013 are conducted at the hospital, according to Ukraine\u2019s human rights ombudsman\u00a0Dmytro Lubinets. Footage from the children\u2019s hospital showed volunteers working with police and security services to sift through the rubble as smoke billowed from the facility, as staff described how they tried to rush children to safety in the wake of the attack. Two floors of the hospital were demolished, comprising\u00a0an area of 400 square meters (4,300 sq. ft.), the emergency service said, while Ukraine\u2019s health minister Viktor Liashko said intensive care units, oncology departments and surgery units had been damaged. \u201cNow we have evacuated all the children. Those who came for routine treatment have gone home, consulted with their doctors, and will decide where they will continue their treatment,\u201d he told CNN Tuesday. \u201cThe rest of the children who were on oxygen support and connected to life support devices are now in hospitals and are being provided with adequate medical care.\u201d The attacks were part of a rare daylight bombardment on Ukrainian cities, some of which are heavily populated areas far from the front lines. It came a day before US President Joe Biden was set to host a crucial NATO Summit in Washington, where announcements over the alliance\u2019s military, political and financial support for Kyiv are expected. Biden called the strikes a \u201chorrific reminder of Russia\u2019s brutality.\u201d \u201cIt is critical that the world continues to stand with Ukraine at this important moment and that we not ignore Russian aggression,\u201d Biden said, noting that he would meet with Volodymyr Zelensky during the summit \u201cto make clear our support for Ukraine is unshakeable.\u201d Meanwhile, seven people were killed in a Russian attack Monday on a private medical facility in Kyiv belonging to the Adonis network, the company said. Of those killed, five were staff members and two were patients, Adonis said. Russia\u2019s defense ministry on Monday claimed that Moscow had struck \u201cmilitary industrial facilities of Ukraine and air bases of the Ukrainian armed forces\u201d using long-range, high-precision weapons. At a special meeting of the UN Security Council on Tuesday called to discuss the Russian strike, Russian UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia denied targeting the children\u2019s hospital. \u201cWe have not bombed the children\u2019s hospital,\u201d Nebenzia said\u00a0when responding to an accusation that Russia committed a war crime for allegedly striking the hospital. Eyewitnesses recount hospital strike Eyewitnesses recalled scenes of chaos moments after the Russian missile slammed into the children\u2019s hospital. Ophthalmologist Lesya Lysytsia told CNN: \u201cYou see the light, then the sound, then everything falls down and then over the next several seconds you think, \u2018are you still alive or is it the end and what to do? Where are the patients? How are the patients? How are the children?\u2019\u201d Natalia Sardudinova, a senior nurse, described the strike as \u201cscary,\u201d when \u201cwindows were crunching.\u201d She told CNN that two children were in operating theaters at the time of the blast, and they were relocated to a shelter in the basement once their procedures were completed. \u201cEverything was in smoke, there was no air to breathe. The doctor was cut by shrapnel. The windows and doors were blown out. One nurse in the hospital was heavily injured,\u201d Sardudinova added. \u201cMy hands are still shaking. They don\u2019t let anyone in now, they are afraid it will collapse.\u201d Yulia Vasylenko, the mother of an 11-year-old cancer patient at the hospital, said her son Denys was evacuated outside following the strike. \u201cMy son is on painkillers. He has cancer. He has been without medication for half a day. He was brought down the stairs from the third floor. There was smoke (and) heavy dust,\u201d she said. Iryna Filimonova, a senior nurse at the pediatric urology department, told CNN an operation on a 2-year-old was underway when the strike happened. \u201cThe lights went out, everything went out. We pulled out the instruments, shining flashlights. Everything was sewn up quickly,\u201d Filimonova said. \u201cThe baby was brought down (to the shelter)\u2026 Some of my nursing colleagues who worked in the operating theaters and some doctors were cut by glass fragments. Our department was destroyed.\u201d Another operating theater nurse, Oksana Mosiychuk, said one medical team tried to extinguish a blaze that broke out in their department, including an operating table which had caught fire. Air raid sirens continued to ring out over Kyiv in the aftermath, with CNN video showing people who had been evacuated pushing children on stretchers to safety. Scores of volunteers later dropped off much-needed supplies and donations \u2013 including water, food, medicine and diapers \u2013 to the hospital. A UN team who visited the site later saw children \u201creceiving treatment for cancer in hospital beds set up in parks and on streets, where medical workers had quickly established triage areas, amongst chaos, dust and debris,\u201d the UN\u2019s human rights chief Volker Turk said in a statement. In the hospital\u2019s newer building, 12 departments were damaged, and a section of Ukraine\u2019s only oncology and hematology laboratory was completely destroyed, according to the Kyiv military administration. UN holds special meeting Zelensky had called for an emergency assembly of the UN Security Council after the strike while vowing retaliation over the attacks. At the special meeting Tuesday, Nebenzia, the Russian ambassador, alleged, without any proof, that a\u00a0Ukrainian\u00a0anti-aircraft missile is what struck the hospital. \u201cIf this had been a Russian strike, there would have been nothing left of the building at all. All the children and most of the adults would have been killed, not wounded,\u201d Nebenzia said. Ukraine shot down 30 out of 38 missiles launched by Russia during the Monday attack, the commander of the Ukrainian Air Force said in a statement, adding that Moscow used ballistic, cruise, guided and air-launched ballistic missiles. Ukrainian defense minister, Rustem Umerov, appealed for more air defense systems to support the war-torn country. Zelensky has repeatedly called on the West to provide it with more air defense systems to better protect its cities. Last month, he praised Biden for prioritizing a delivery after the two presidents signed a security agreement. Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general sent evidence of Monday\u2019s Russian attacks to the office of the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court on Monday. It came as several European nations denounced the shelling, with France urging for the attack to \u201cbe added to the list of war crimes for which Russia will be held to account.\u201d Germany and Slovakia have agreed to take in children from Ukraine for treatment. German health minister Karl Lauterbach said a rescue flight will leave on Wednesday, according to a post from the German embassy in London on X. Meanwhile, the Czech foreign minister said he summoned the Russian ambassador in Prague over the attack on the hospital. Monday\u2019s attack is the tragic but all too familiar reality for many of Ukraine\u2019s civilians over the past two and a half years since Russia\u2019s unprovoked invasion. Since February 2022, the conflict has claimed the lives of 11,126 people and injured 21,863 others, according to data in May from the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine. Additionally, the heavy fighting has caused an estimated 3.7 million people to be driven from their homes and internally displaced while nearly 6.5 million people have fled to neighboring countries, the UNHCR has said. According to the World Health Organization, there have been more than 1,600 instances of heavy weapons attacks impacting medical facilities in Ukraine since the start of the full-scale invasion, with 141 people killed in these attacks. Health minister Liashko told CNN on Tuesday that of the impacted facilities, \u201cmore than 250 have been completely destroyed and cannot be restored. Only new ones can be built.\u201d Last December, 12 pregnant women and four newborn babies had a fortunate escape from a maternity hospital in Dnipro that had been extensively damaged in an airstrike. Previously, the bombing of a maternity and children\u2019s hospital in Mariupol less than a month after Russian troops flooded across the border sparked international condemnation.

Their peaceful green campaigns have been championed by climate activist Greta Thunberg and in 2015, they successfully fought against a plan for a hydroelectric dam they claim would have damaged a pristine rainforest valley. But this week, the Southeast Asian nation sentenced 10 activists from the group Mother Nature Cambodia to up to six years in prison each on charges of conspiring against the state. The government says the group encourages social unrest, but to their supporters, the ruling is just the latest in a pattern of attacks on climate activists in the wider region. \u201cWe demand that our friends in Mother Nature Cambodia, and all political prisoners, be released immediately,\u201d said Fridays for Future, the youth-led global climate strike movement founded by Thunberg, in a statement. Exiled opposition leader Mu Sochua said the group had tried to highlight environmental issues that \u201cthreaten Cambodia\u2019s fragile environment\u201d and claimed, \u201cthey would be heroes in any free country.\u201d \u201cTheir convictions only show how Cambodian courts are simply being used as weapons (by the state) to halt any kind of public discussion,\u201d Mu Sochua told CNN. \u201cThe sentences are a disaster for environmentalism in Cambodia and for people everywhere, who care about the future of our planet.\u201d Cambodia, a kingdom of nearly 17 million people that is rich in natural resources, faces pressing threats to its environment, including deforestation from illegal logging and agricultural expansion, water pollution affecting inland and coastal areas, and a surge in plastic waste. The country maintains about 46% forest cover and is home to 2,300 plant species and 14 endangered animals, according to the United States Agency for International Development. \u201cDeforestation and wildlife crimes continue to threaten Cambodia\u2019s forests and biodiversity,\u201d USAID says on its website. Critics and environmental groups say those threats have heightened under the nearly four-decade-long rule of strongman Hun Sen \u2013 who has quashed dissent and jailed opponents in recent years, forcing many to flee overseas. Though his eldest son, Hun Manet, succeeded him as prime minister last year, Hun Sen is still widely seen as the ruling party\u2019s center of power. \u201cLike what we are seeing with dictators in other countries, Cambodia is becoming more repressed,\u201d said Alejandro Gonzalez-Davidson, a Spaniard who co-founded Mother Nature Cambodia over a decade ago, alongside local Cambodian activists. Climate activism in the country is at a \u201crougher, grassroots level,\u201d he added, with the conversation centering more on \u201cextremely rich and powerful tycoons and corrupt government officials trying to exploit and privatize,\u201d the environment. \u201cThis is Cambodia now \u2013 logging, poaching, mineral extraction, turning lakes into land and destroying rivers, as well as exporting massive amounts of sands. There are systems in place where (officials) exploit the environment for profit and our group has been doing as much as we can to stop these unethical projects and protect the environment \u2013 and that is why we are a threat in the regime\u2019s eyes.\u201d CNN has reached out to the Cambodian government for comment on the court ruling and allegations in this story. Outside the court ahead of Tuesday\u2019s ruling, a government spokesperson denied that the charges against the activists were politically motivated. \u201cThe government has never taken action against those who criticize. We only take action against those who commit crimes,\u201d spokesperson Pen Bona told Reuters. Award-winning campaigners Founded in 2012, Mother Nature Cambodia has campaigned against environmental destruction and exposed alleged corruption in state management of precious mineral resources, and their savvy use of social media has resonated with young Cambodians. In 2023, the group was awarded the Right Livelihood Award, often called the \u201calternative Nobel Prize.\u201d \u201cMother Nature Cambodia is a group of fearless young activists fighting for environmental rights and democracy in the face of repression by the Cambodian regime,\u201d the jury said in a speech at the time, describing them as \u201ca powerful voice for environmental preservation and democracy in Cambodia.\u201d Several activists were unable to receive the award in person as Cambodian courts denied their requests to travel to Sweden to collect the prize. \u201cThey have successfully helped local communities stop environmental violations,\u201d Right Livelihood\u2019s executive director Ole von Uexkuell said last year. \u201cThrough innovative and often humorous protests, their activism defends nature and livelihoods while upholding communities\u2019 voices against corrupt and damaging products.\u201d The group has strongly leveraged social media, saying it helps get their message across to young supporters. They have more than 450,000 followers on Facebook, the most widely used social platform in the country. But it\u2019s on TikTok that their videos really make an impression on young Cambodian users like Run Bunry, a high-school student from the capital Phnom Penh and his friends. \u201cThey are positive and lighthearted and also teach us a lot about the environment,\u201d he said. One video, highlighting an investigation into the alleged illegal export of rare silica sand, showed three members buried up to their heads in sand and was shared more than 1,000 times. Another viral video taken along a beach in the coastal city Sihanoukville showed the extent of alleged illegal construction by hotels and casinos on the shore. \u201cFollower numbers have grown especially in the last five years and a lot of our old content regularly resurfaces on TikTok and goes viral,\u201d said founding member Gonzalez-Davidson, who was expelled from Cambodia in 2015 after the group\u2019s successful campaign to stop a Chinese-funded hydropower dam from being built over the Areng Valley, an area of pristine rainforest in southwest Cambodia. Members of the group say they have faced increasing threats, harassment and criminal charges for years. Under scorching heat on Tuesday, members of the group \u2013 dressed in white and accompanied by a crowd of supporters \u2013 staged a mock funeral procession in the streets leading to the Phnom Penh Municipal Court. But peaceful scenes descended into chaos after the sentencing was announced. Video footage showed activists Mother Nature Cambodia activists Ly Chandaravuth, Long Kunthea, Thun Ratha, Phuon Keoraksmey and Yim Leanghy surrounded by dozens of armed police officers and dragged away into waiting cars, bound for prisons across the country. Rights activist Pilorge Naly of NGO the Cambodian League for the Promotion and Defence of Human Rights was at the scene and told CNN the arrests were immediate and violent. Journalists and supporters were also pushed and shoved by security officers, she said. Arrest warrants have been issued for five other members of the group, including Gonzalez-Davidson, who was sentenced to eight years in prison Tuesday on the conspiracy charge and insulting Cambodia\u2019s king. \u201cThe increasing use by Cambodian authorities of l\u00e8se majest\u00e9 and other articles of Cambodia\u2019s criminal code to penalise the exercise of human rights is deeply worrying,\u201d United Nations Human Rights spokesperson Thameen Al-Kheetan said in a statement following the ruling. Gonzalez-Davidson, however, said the ruling would backfire against the authorities and inspire a new cohort of environmental campaigners. \u201cThis week, a new generation of Cambodian activists was born \u2013 one that did not exist back in 2012,\u201d he said. \u201cMany young Cambodians are very engaged in the next steps and public campaigning must continue. There have been (arrests and jailings) before and each time, we come out stronger. \u201cThey won\u2019t break our spirits. We are not going to be shut down.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/06/asia/mother-nature-cambodia-climate-youth-activists-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_09_style_dolley-madison-first-lady-photo-smithsonian-tan", "text": "The Smithsonian\u2019s National Portrait Gallery (NPG) in Washington, DC, has acquired the earliest known photograph of a US first lady. The quarter-plate daguerreotype of former First Lady Dolley Madison, wife of fourth US president James Madison, dates from around 1846. It joins a host of other early photographic portraits in the NPG\u2019s collection, including what is believed to be the earliest photograph of a US president, an 1843 daguerreotype of John Quincy Adams by Philip Haas, which was acquired by the museum in 2017. The Dolley Madison daguerreotype, made by artist and entrepreneur John Plumbe Jr., shows the trailblazing first lady when she was in her late seventies. Plumbe, an English immigrant who came to America in 1821, picked up photography professionally around 20 years after his arrival, establishing studios in more than a dozen cities before selling his business in 1847. In addition to his portrait of Madison, he created the earliest extant image of the US Capitol. The NPG bought the Madison photograph for $456,000 at a Sotheby\u2019s auction of books, manuscripts and Americana on June 28, more than six times the lot\u2019s high estimate of $70,000. The funds were provided in part by the Secretary of the Smithsonian, Lonnie G. Bunch III, and the Joseph L. and Emily K. Gidwitz Memorial Foundation Endowment, in addition to private support. Sotheby\u2019s auction catalog described the piece as \u201cone of exceedingly few surviving photographs of the woman who has defined for two centuries what it means to be the first lady of the United States of America\u201d. \u201cThis artifact will provide the Smithsonian another opportunity to tell a more robust American story and illuminate the vital role women like Madison have played in the nation\u2019s progress,\u201d Bunch said in a statement. Dolley Payne Todd Madison, who was raised by a Quaker family in Philadelphia, is considered by many to have invented the role of first lady. Her extroversion, intelligence and prowess as a hostess helped her husband create strategic political friendships and position the White House at the center of Washington society. Her Wednesday night soirees became the stuff of legend during her tenure as first lady, and the US House of Representatives granted her an honorary seat whenever she wanted to attend sessions at the Capitol. At her funeral, President Zachary Taylor characterized Madison as \u201cthe first lady of the land for half a century,\u201d marking the first ever use of the phrase \u201cfirst lady.\u201d The daguerreotype was the first widely available photographic process, invented by its namesake, Louis Daguerre, in 1839. The process involves polishing a sheet of silver-plated copper and treating it with light-sensitive fumes before exposing it to a camera, and then drawing the latent image forth with mercury vapor and chemical treatments. It was the most popular and accessible form of photographic image-making in the 1840s and \u201850s.

{"id": "2024_07_10_travel_camp-stove-cooking-wellness", "text": "You know what I love doing in the summer? I\u2019ll give you three things: \u2022 Taking road trip vacations\u2022 Eating well on my road trips\u2022 Not going over my food budget while on a road trip That last one is a little tricky to pull off because \u2014 and I admit this might be an obvious statement \u2014 the cost of eating adds up over the course of a vacation. Even if you\u2019re not the kind of person who loves to fill up on a big, leisurely brunch, finding affordable but memorable options for every meal during a long trip can be challenging. I used to make do with deli sandwiches and brought-from-home snacks, but now I have a secret weapon for quick but satisfying road trip lunches: my Coleman camp stove. Despite my outdoorsy hippie reputation among friends, this was the first time I dove into cooking on an outdoor propane stove before renting a camper van for a cross-country trip with my husband on Route 66. But once we were on the road and figured out the logistics of our travel routine, I realized the stove\u2019s versatility and utility, not to mention the genuine fun of being able to cook lunch on the go. With a two-burner stove and pump sink in the back of our camper van, we could pull over and cook lunch pretty much anywhere during each day\u2019s adventures. I made pesto rotini in the parking lot of Ulysses S. Grant\u2019s historic home in Missouri, flipped grilled cheese sandwiches in a local park in Baxter Springs, Kansas, and slurped up cheesy zoodles outside the Painted Desert Inn in Petrified Forest National Park. Now I\u2019m a seasoned outdoor cook and have invested in a full mini kitchen setup for my camping excursions. I\u2019ve fallen in love with camp stove cooking so much that I now bring it with us on most of our summer road trips \u2014 whether we\u2019re camping or not. Coupled with my trusty 10-inch cast-iron skillet, the camp stove gives me a way to save a few bucks and eat well during the day so we can have a big dinner out. I might get a few stares in hotel parking lots and patio areas, but it\u2019s worth it for the convenience and reassurance of a good meal while sticking to my frugal budget. Hey, I own all these items already \u2014 why not use them? My road-trip stove setup Along with my stove and skillet, I also bring a few basic tools for cooking and cleaning. I keep a crate packed with the following: \u2022 Metal tongs\u2022 Fish spatula (slotted spatula)\u2022 Silicone spoonula\u2022 Silicone trivet\u2022 Olive oil (in a small squeeze bottle)\u2022 Kosher salt\u2022 Bar towels\u2022 Washcloth\u2022 Laundry tub\u2022 Castile soap Because I\u2019m using a propane stove, I only cook in well-ventilated outdoor areas and bring a foldable metal table to make sure there is a safe cooking surface no matter where I\u2019ll be. Keep meals simple with pre-prepped ingredients Simplicity is the key to easy camp stove lunches. When I\u2019m planning these meals, I don\u2019t want to complicate my prep with anything that requires chopping on-site. Remember, all equipment needs to be washed in your hotel bathroom, so this is no time to get fancy. To accomplish this, I turn to pre-prepped ingredients, a departure from my usual higher-maintenance home cooking. However, these items are easy to find in many US grocery stores, so they don\u2019t need to be packed in advance. With these versatile building blocks, I can make a variety of meals. I start with a base of shelf-stable carbs, such as bagged, ready-to-eat pasta, rice or grain blends. Protein comes in the form of beans, whether canned or bagged, frozen mini meatballs or seasoned tofu or seitan from the refrigerated section. The frozen and refrigerated produce sections offer a cornucopia of quick-cooking vegetable choices, including zoodles, cauliflower rice and stir-fry blends, pre-chopped onions and peppers, green beans, snap peas, baby spinach, and broccoli florets. Sauces can be as varied as pesto, marinara, salsa, salad dressings, or simply a bit of butter and salt. I\u2019ve also been known to bring some cheese powder from my pantry to make a macaroni and cheese meal as well. Don\u2019t forget that a one-skillet meal can also be as easy as a quesadilla, nachos, flatbreads or a homemade grilled cheese that beats the pants off a basic cold deli sandwich. Mix and match these ingredients and find the fun in cooking outdoors on your camp stove for your next road trip.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/10/travel/camp-stove-cooking-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "world_africa_bananas-artificial-hair-cheverux-organique-spc", "text": "During a visit to a local farm while working with development agency USAID, Ugandan entrepreneur Juliet Tumusiime realized that a huge amount of banana stems are left over from banana cultivation and simply discarded. Looking for a way to use the waste, she struck upon an innovative business idea. Almost a decade later, now aged 42, Tumusiime is the chief executive and co-founder of Cheveux Organique, which manufactures hair made from banana fibers as an alternative to synthetic extensions. Fashion trends among the younger population and growing purchasing power have boosted the market for hair extensions and wigs in the Africa and the Middle East, which could be worth $710 million by 2028, according to Research and Markets. Extensions are typically made from human hair, or synthetic materials such as nylon, polyester, acrylic and PVC. Synthetics are popular in Uganda because they\u2019re much cheaper, but they\u2019re not biodegradable or easy to recycle. Some people complain that synthetic hair can irritate their scalp and a study of synthetic hair in Nigeria found the presence of potentially harmful heavy metals and chemicals. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to friends, colleagues, both men and women and asked them how they dispose of their hair when they take it out,\u201d Tumusiime says. \u201cA lot of the time it is just thrown in the trash. The level of awareness is really low - most people don\u2019t realize that they are wearing plastic on their head which can irritate the skin and cause pollution. \u201cOur mission is to transform the beauty industry by providing alternatives that benefit their health and the environment. We want to empower women to make informed decisions about what hair they use and what\u2019s best for them.\u201d Tumusiime says that, unlike synthetic hair, her product is biodegradable, durable and can be easily styled, treated and colored. It can also be rewashed with warm water and conditioned with detangling cream. When dry, the hypoallergenic hair can be oiled and can withstand dryers and heat up to 400 degrees, lasting weeks longer than synthetic alternatives, according to Tumusiime. Since it\u2019s made from discarded banana stems, she adds, it\u2019s also a way to help curb that waste. Uganda is Africa\u2019s largest producer and consumer of bananas, producing about 10 million metric tons of bananas per day. Ugandans consume almost one kilogram of the fruit per person, per day, with more than 75% of the population relying on bananas as a staple food, according to the World Economic Forum. Cheveux Organique works closely with local banana farmers, buying stems that would otherwise be discarded. The stems are split and the fibers extracted by machine. The extracted fibers are then dried and treated, before being combed out, resulting in the hair-like texture. The \u201chair\u201d is dyed into three shades: Cheveux Black, Cheveux Brown and Cheveux Blonde. Tumusiime says it has a natural sheen, is soft to the touch and can be used for braiding and styling. It\u2019s also suitable for warm and humid climates, she notes. The company isn\u2019t unique in creating plant-based hair. In the US, St.Louis-based Rebundle also sells hair extensions made from banana fibers, while Nourie Hair offers a hair alternative for braiding made from Ginseng root extract and rosemary. However, turning banana waste into a premium product does not come without challenges for Cheveux Organique. \u201cThe labor-intensive process, from picking the stems, transporting them to the facility, extracting the stems, treating them and the power needed to use this \u2013 it causes the product to become pricey,\u201d Tumusiime says. Cheveux Organique sells its plant-based hair in Uganda, and as fair afield as the US, France and the UK. It retails for $50 for 150 grams (5.3 ounces), which Tumusiime says is cheaper than a typical $185 for a similar amount of human hair. But synthetic hair can be bought for as little as $1 for a bundle. \u201cThis is something that we are hugely concerned about, and we are trying to find ways to mechanize the business and produce volumes of hair whilst continuing to break even,\u201d Tumusiime says. \u201cThe people paying these prices are getting a premium product at the end of it \u2013 and it\u2019s about the long-term benefits that this product brings.\u201d Tumusiime says her startup, which currently employs 25 permanent staff members and 100 part-time workers for waste gathering, is in the process of creating regional hubs, which will function as extraction centers, as well as an education point for young people. The hubs will train future generations on the positive impacts of waste management, as well as giving young people skillsets \u2013 such as extraction and machine operation \u2013 that will equip them for future careers. \u201cWe want to make sure that this brand is a household name,\u201d Tumusiime says. \u201cWe want to become leaders in this industry despite challenges. But I\u2019m passionate about what I\u2019m doing. I\u2019m not about to give up. I do everything possible to make sure that I achieve my objectives and achieve the vision for which I started this organization.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/world/africa/bananas-artificial-hair-cheverux-organique-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "world"}}

Police had earlier said they were searching for a 26-year-old man, named as Kyle Clifford, in connection with the deaths, who could be in the British capital or the neighboring county of Hertfordshire. Police were called to a house in Bushey, Hertfordshire, on Tuesday evening, where they found three seriously injured women who later died from their wounds. The victims of the triple killlings were identified as the wife, Carol Hunt, and two daughters, Hannah Hunt and Louise Hunt, of BBC racing commentator John Hunt, the UK\u2019s public broadcaster said on Wednesday. Police said earlier that the deceased, ages 25, 28 and 61, were killed in what is believed to have been a \u201ctargeted incident.\u201d A crossbow is believed to have been used in the triple killing, though police said Wednesday that other weapons may also have been used. Clifford left the British army in 2022 after a short period of service, a source in the UK defense ministry told CNN.

Five independent candidates who have been vocal in their support for Gaza won parliamentary seats, while a surge in votes for independents elsewhere denied Labour a victory in areas they were expected to win, leaving a small dent in its otherwise huge majority but raising questions about its foreign policy positions. In Leicester South, a seat in an industrial city in the English Midlands, Labour shadow cabinet member Jonathan Ashworth lost his seat by 979 votes to Shockat Adam, an independent candidate who made his support for Gaza a key part of his electoral pledge to voters. \u201cThis is for Gaza,\u201d Adam declared in his victory speech. Ashworth\u2019s defeat comes as a huge shock. At the last general election, when Labour slumped to its worst defeat since 1935 under the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn, Ashworth still won the seat with a huge majority, receiving 67% of the vote. In Islington North, Corbyn was reelected to the seat he has held since 1983 \u2013 but this time as an independent, rather than for Labour. Corbyn, who was Labour leader between 2015 and 2020, was expelled from the party after the UK\u2019s human rights watchdog found Labour to be responsible for \u201cunlawful\u201d acts of harassment and discrimination under his leadership, when complaints of antisemitism proliferated. Corbyn won 49.2% of the vote, while the Labour candidate came in second with 34.4%. Corbyn said the voters of Islington North were \u201clooking for a government that on the world stage will search for peace, not war, and not allow the terrible conditions to go on that are happening in Gaza at the present time.\u201d In Blackburn, Labour incumbent Kate Hollern \u2013 who won a majority of 18,304 at the 2019 general election \u2013 lost by just 132 votes to independent candidate Adnan Hussain. In Dewsbury and Batley, the independent Iqbal Mohamed also defeated Labour incumbent Heather Iqbal. And in Birmingham Perry Barr, independent Ayoub Khan defeated Labour incumbent Khalid Mahmood by 507 votes. Meanwhile, in Chingford and Woodford Green, a constituency in east London, the left-wing vote was split between Labour and Faiza Shaheen \u2013 a candidate who stood as an independent after being ousted by Labour during the campaign \u2013 allowing the Conservative incumbent Iain Duncan Smith to retain his seat by about 5,000 votes. \u201cOur vote was a combination of those appalled by how I was treated, those who took issue with having an imposed candidate who didn\u2019t know us, those who were never going to vote Labour after Starmer\u2019s stance on Gaza, and those that have never voted before,\u201d Shaheen wrote on X after the result. \u201cLabour split the vote the moment they deselected me.\u201d Anger over Labour\u2019s Gaza position Labour had feared that it could lose votes over Gaza since Starmer drew criticism in some quarters over comments made last year, shortly after Hamas launched its October 7 attack on Israel and Israel\u2019s subsequent assault on Gaza. Speaking to UK radio station LBC in October, Starmer \u2013 a former human rights lawyer \u2013 said Israel \u201chas the right\u201d to withhold power and water from Palestinian civilians in Gaza, but added: \u201cObviously, everything should be done within international law.\u201d The comment caused outrage among many left-wing and Muslim voters, leading to furious protests outside the constituency offices of several Labour Members of Parliament (MPs) and complaints of harassment. The anger was compounded after the party refused to back a Scottish National Party (SNP) motion calling for an immediate ceasefire in Israel and Gaza. Labour did, however, pass its own similar motion shortly afterwards. Many of these seats where Labour appears to have lost votes over its position on Gaza have sizable Muslim populations. According to the 2021 census, the populations of Leicester, Birmingham, Ilford and Blackburn are all more than 20% Muslim. Labour lawmakers cling on Wes Streeting, Labour\u2019s shadow health secretary set to play a leading role in Starmer\u2019s next government, clung onto his seat in Ilford North by just 528 votes, ahead of the independent candidate Leanne Mohamad in second. On a visit to the constituency before the election, CNN spoke to Mohamad while she was door-knocking in search of votes. She said, after Streeting abstained from a vote on a Gaza ceasefire, she decided to enter politics and abdicate from Labour. \u201cAs a Palestinian, that place is no longer for me\u2026 The Labour party does not represent us,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cMy family were expelled and forced out of Palestine in 1948. My grandparents never thought they\u2019d see something worse than that.\u201d \u201cAll they wanted was their politician to vote for a ceasefire. No to killing, no to more violence. No to more bombs, and they couldn\u2019t even bring themselves to do that,\u201d she said. Meanwhile Jess Phillips, also a prominent Labour figure, won her Birmingham Yardley seat by just 693 votes. Her closest opponent, Jody McIntyre, stood not as an independent but for the Workers Party of Britain, a fringe party that \u201cmakes no apology for our support for Palestine and the people of Gaza.\u201d As her victory speech was met with loud boos and chants of \u201cShame\u201d and \u201cFree Palestine,\u201d a visibly angry Phillips described the harassment she and her staff had faced during the campaign. \u201cThis election has been the worst election I have ever stood in. Today, a brilliant community activist who puts on events for every single part of our community, came out to campaign with me, and people filmed her on the street and then slashed her tires,\u201d Phillips said. Phillips broke party rank in November by voting for the SNP motion calling for an \u201cimmediate ceasefire\u201d in Gaza, but she has continued to face abuse \u2013 like many female candidates, she said. \u201cThe women in this election campaign have fared considerably worse than any of the men in our city with regard to the threat and aggression,\u201d Phillips later told ITV.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/uk/labour-gaza-israel-vote-uk-election-gbr-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "world"}}

American\u00a0brothers\u00a0Ryan Cooper and Wesley Waren found the body of Bill Stampfl on June 27 on Mount Huascaran,\u00a0according to Joseph Stampfl, Bill\u2019s son. The climbers had been descending the mountain in Peru\u2019s Cordillera Blanca after an unsuccessful attempt to reach its 22,000 ft summit when they found the body, at about 16,500 ft. Cooper told CNN Tuesday they noticed an object that didn\u2019t quite blend into the landscape and decided to investigate. He said the ice had preserved the body and its belongings and Stampfl\u2019s wedding ring, helmet, mountain climbing boots, and jacket were all intact. The brothers managed to identify Stampfl by finding a bag attached to his body, inside which they found his identification card, a camera, passport, wallet, and glasses \u2013 all of which were also intact, Cooper explained. \u201cSomeone loved him and someone wanted him to come home,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cAs soon as I found out he was an American climber I knew we had a responsibility to track down the family and give them the news,\u201d Cooper said. Stampfl and two of his fellow climbers and\u00a0friends, Steve Erskine\u00a0and Matthew Richardson, were all killed by an avalanche on Mount Huascaran on June 24, 2002, his daughter Jennifer Stampfl told CNN on Tuesday. Their bodies were never discovered, except for Erskine\u2019s, she said. Stampfl was 58-years-old at the time. His body was retrieved and brought down the mountain on July 5 by the Peruvian Mountain Rescue Association and Peruvian National Police after coordination with Cooper and Stampfl\u2019s family. His body was taken to a morgue in the town of Yungay for an autopsy, Peru\u2019s National Police posted on X on Tuesday. The US State Department confirmed the death of a US citizen in Peru. \u201cWe offer our sincerest condolences to the family on their loss and thank the mountaineers and the Peruvian National Police rescue team who have been involved in this operation,\u201d a spokesperson for the department said, adding it was providing assistance to the family. Finding Bill\u2019s family Cooper, a native of Las Vegas, Nevada, called his wife and informed her of his discovery the same day he came across Stampfl\u2019s\u00a0body. He\u00a0asked her for help in finding Stampfl\u2019s\u00a0family, as he was still on Mount Huascaran with limited cellular service. After much online research, Cooper\u2019s wife was able to locate Joseph and called him on June 29. \u201cI told him I know the location of his dad. I told him about the ring and personal items,\u201d Cooper said. His motive was to help the family find closure, Cooper explained. With \u201cno body, there\u2019s no way to find peace with that,\u201d Cooper said. Cooper also spoke to Jennifer and Stampfl\u2019s widow Janet on the phone before sending photos of Stampfl\u2019s ID and other belongings to the family. \u2018My heart just sank\u2019 After so many years, the news came as an emotional shock to Stampfl\u2019s family. \u201cMy heart just sank. After 22 years I had been okay with the fact that he\u2019s there. He\u2019s part of the mountain. Like we\u2019re never going to get him back. The fact that they found him, it opened up all the wounds,\u201d Jennifer told CNN on Tuesday. \u201cThere is no preparation for having your husband killed instantaneously,\u201d Janet said, adding that she never thought her husband\u2019s body would be discovered. \u201cIt\u2019s an answer to so many prayers by so many people.\u201d Janet said her husband loved climbing mountains. \u201cHe enjoyed it so much. He said he always felt closest to God when he got to the top of the mountain,\u201d Janet said. \u201cAfter 22 years\u2026I was a little shocked, it took me a while to process everything,\u201d Joseph said, adding \u201cnow it\u2019s time to bring him home hopefully.\u201d Following an autopsy in Yungay, Stampfl\u2019s body was transferred to the city of Juarez, Joseph explained. Stampfl will be taken to a funeral home in Lima where he will be cremated, and the ashes will be sent to the family in the United States. \u2018A dangerous landscape\u2019 While Cooper is grateful to have finally been able to bring closure to the Stampfl family, the discovery was also tinged with sadness. He had hoped that Richardson\u2019s body might have been attached to Stampfl by a rope, but that was not the case and \u201che\u2019s still missing as of today.\u201d He also fears that global warming may have played a role in his discovery, by thawing the ice on what is considered the world\u2019s highest tropical mountain range. \u201cHe was fully exposed and not in ice anymore. The thawing process happened,\u201d Cooper said. Since the 1950s, almost all of the world\u2019s glaciers have been retreating, according to a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. On average, the glaciers in the Andean region \u2013 Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru \u2013 have lost over 50 per cent of their coverage since the 1960s. \u201cThe Andes is deteriorating more than any other mountain range in the region,\u201d Cooper said, adding that the changing conditions were part of what had prevented him from summiting Mount Huascaran. \u201cGlaciers are melting away, the landscape has changed. It poses a dangerous landscape now,\u201d he said.

It said that under the memorandum of understanding the US would also support Panama with \u201cequipment, transportation and logistics\u201d regarding foreigners found \u201cin violation of the immigration laws of Panama.\u201d Panama agreed to \u201ccomply with all international agreements and conventions on the rights of immigrants and those in refugee status,\u201d it added. Panama is home to the Dari\u00e9n Gap, a mountainous rainforest region connecting South and Central America, that has seen an increase in the number of migrants willing to risk their lives and safety to cross it. The 66-mile (106-kilometer) hike through the Darien Gap brings migrants from Colombia to Panama and is a crucial passage for those hoping to reach the United States and Canada. News of the agreement comes after Panama\u2019s new President Jose Raul Mulino vowed on Monday that the Central American nation would no longer be a country of transit for migrants. \u201cI will not allow Panama to be a path open to thousands of people who enter our country illegally supported by an entire international organization related to drug and human trafficking,\u201d Mulino said at his swearing-in ceremony. \u201cPanama will no longer be a transit country for illegals,\u201d he said amid cheers from those present. \u201cThe numbers of illegal immigrants passing through the Dari\u00e9n are shocking,\u201d Mulino said, adding that he intends to \u201cappeal to international solidarity regarding the cause that generates the problem and will seek solutions with the countries involved, especially with the United States, which is the final destination of such immigrants.\u201d Mulino said that he\u2019s seen first-hand \u201cthe magnitude of the problem and the dimension of the humanitarian and environmental crisis\u201d that migration causes to the Dari\u00e9n Gap. \u201cThe Dari\u00e9n must continue to be a great green lung, not only for us but for the entire region.

{"id": "2024_07_05_asia_japan-us-fighter-jets-intl-hnk-ml", "text": "The US military will send dozens of its newest fighter jets to Japan as part of a $10 billion upgrade of its forces in the country, the Defense Department announced Wednesday. In a news release, the Pentagon said the effort would be carried out \u201cover the next several years\u201d to \u201cenhance the US-Japan Alliance, bolster regional deterrence, and strengthen peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.\u201d The modernization plan will see 48 fifth-generation F-35A fighters replace 36 F-16s at Misawa Air Base in northern Japan, and 36 brand-new F-15EX jets deploy to Kadena Air Base on the southern island of Okinawa, replacing 48 older F-15C/D models that have been pulled from the region in the past year, the Pentagon release said. At Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni, just south of Hiroshima on the main island of Honshu, the number of deployed F-35B aircraft will be modified, the Pentagon said, without giving specific numbers. \u201cThe Department\u2019s plan to station the Joint Force\u2019s most advanced tactical aircraft in Japan demonstrates the ironclad U.S. commitment to the defense of Japan and both countries\u2019 shared vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific region,\u201d the news release said. Japan said basing the new fighter aircraft in the country would enhance US capabilities there. \u201cIn the face of the most severe and complex security environment since the end of World War II, and amidst the increased military activities of neighboring countries, the United States is maintaining and strengthening the presence of U.S. forces in Japan to further enhance the deterrence and response capabilities of the Japan-U.S. alliance,\u201d Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi, the government\u2019s top spokesman, said at a regular briefing Thursday. Japan\u2019s alliance with the US has become increasingly important in a region that is seeing China, Russia and North Korea all pose threats that Tokyo seeks to counter. Japan has festering territorial disputes in the north with Russia and with China over islands in the East China Sea. Meanwhile, North Korea\u2019s growing missile program, which has seen Pyongyang send missiles over Japanese territory in recent years, draws condemnation from Tokyo with every projectile test. Japan also keeps a wary eye on the situation surrounding Taiwan, the self-ruled democratic island that the Chinese Communist Party has vowed to bring under Beijing\u2019s control, by force if necessary. As much as 90% of Japan\u2019s energy supplies come via sea lanes near Taiwan, according to Tokyo, which sees the status quo around the island as key to its security. Okinawa is only about 450 miles (725 kilometers) from Taiwan, and both the US and Japan maintain key air bases on the island. US air power in Japan The US Air Force calls the Kadena Air Base, home of the 18th Wing, its \u201cKeystone of the Pacific,\u201d and for more than four decades the older model F-15s based there were central to US deterrence in the region. But from 2022, as the twin-engine fighters neared the end of their service life, the US Air Force began pulling them from Kadena. While the service has rotated other assets through the air base since, to cover the absence of the older F-15s, the permanent presence of the F-15EXs will bring stability to the force structure. The F-15EX is a leap above the older models. Manufacturer Boeing says the jet has \u201cunparalleled weapons capacity,\u201d with an ability to carry 12 advanced medium-range, air-to-air missiles (AMRAAM) and\u00a0to fire them from a range \u201cfarther than any other fighter in the US Air Force arsenal.\u201d Although not a stealth fighter like the F-35, Boeing says the F-15EX has next-generation survivability. \u201cIt serves as a long-range standoff weapons system that is also capable of penetrating and surviving in highly contested environments,\u201d the company says on its website. Military aviation analyst Peter Layton said the F-15EXs would be a worry for China in the event of any conflict. The jet can be fitted with stealthy long-range cruise missiles with a range of more than 500 miles (800 kilometers) that could strike inside the Chinese mainland, he said. Newer missiles under development could double that distance, he added. \u201cThat will hold at risk even more Chinese mainland military bases and offer a very quick attack option,\u201d Layton said. The F-15EX is the Air Force\u2019s newest fighter jet, with the first operational plane delivered to the Oregon Air National Guard in early June. The F-35As that will be stationed at Misawa Air Base are the Air Force\u2019s newest stealth fighters. They\u2019ve long been designated as the replacement for F-16s in the USAF inventory. F-35s deliver \u201can enhanced capability to survive in the advanced threat environment in which it was designed to operate,\u201d an Air Force fact sheet says. Layton said the F-15EXs and F-35As complement each other well in a combat scenario. \u201cThe F-35 is an excellent low-observable sensor platform that could operate forward in stealth mode relaying data back to patrolling F-15EXs with their supersonic cruise and large air-to-air missile load outs,\u201d said Layton, a fellow at the Griffith Asia Institute in Australia and former Royal Australian Air Force officer. The aircraft deployments add to other improvements Washington has been making to its force structure in Japan, where the US has more than 50,000 troops. Okinawa houses more than 25,000 US military personnel and more than two dozen military installations. Roughly 70% of the US military bases in Japan are on Okinawa. The US and Japan announced last year that a newly redesignated Marine unit with advanced intelligence, surveillance capabilities and the ability to fire anti-ship missiles would be based in Japan.

The robot dog, which is currently being field-tested, is able to navigate its physical environment via cameras and sensors, including recognizing traffic light signals, which traditional guide dogs are unable to do. Roughly the size of an English Bulldog but a bit wider, it can communicate by listening and speaking with a visually impaired operator with AI-technology incorporated in its voice recognition, route planning capabilities and traffic light recognition. It also has six legs, which the researchers say help it walk smoothly and with maximum stability. \u201cWhen three legs are lifted, there are still three legs \u2026 like the tripod of a camera.

I can mass-produce them in the same way as cars, so it will become more affordable,\u201d Gao said. \u201cI think this could be a very large market, because there might be tens of millions of people in the world who need guide dogs.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/china/chinese-robot-guide-dog-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_04_europe_uk-election-europe-populist-surge-intl", "text": "The United Kingdom\u2019s decision to hand the center-left Labour Party a parliamentary majority comes at the same time Europe is broadly in the grip of what some call a right-wing populist surge. Last month\u2019s\u00a0European elections\u00a0saw a historic number of lawmakers from hard-right and far-right parties elected to the European Parliament. The results caused such chaos that French President Emmanuel Macron called a snap parliamentary election in his own country, the first round of which the far-right National Rally\u00a0won last week. A government composed of far-right figures was formed in the Netherlands this week. Italy is led by the most right-wing leader since the rule of fascist wartime leader Benito Mussolini. These electoral victories and the prospect of populist right-wingers in power is no longer a surprise in European countries. There are many reasons for this rise in populism, often unique to individual countries. But broadly speaking, a number of European countries are suffering from sluggish economies, high immigration and higher energy prices, due in part to the drive for carbon net zero. The European Union is often blamed for national woes by populist politicians and breathes oxygen into an increasingly Euroskeptic national discourse. So why is Britain, the only country where Euroskepticism led to a referendum on EU membership, bucking this trend? Despite the scale of the Labour victory, it is clear from the results that the British right is far from dead. The Conservative Party, despite its undeniably disappointing night,\u00a0has outperformed against\u00a0the\u00a0expectations of a number of opinion polls during the campaign, some of which predicted it would win fewer than 100 seats \u2013 which would have been a truly epic wipeout. Another party that exceeded polling expectations\u00a0is the populist right-wing Reform UK, led by long-term scourge of the Conservatives Nigel Farage, who is perhaps best known these days for his friendship with former US President Donald Trump. Before this, he was credited with making Brexit possible after decades of campaigning against the UK\u2019s membership of the EU. On his eighth attempt, Farage has now been elected as a member of parliament (MP). The Conservatives may have been reduced to only 121 seats and Reform may have only secured four, as of Friday morning, but the overall vote share for these two parties combined is larger than that of Labour \u2013 which has secured more than 400 seats. This will doubtless have a major impact on what happens next to the right of British politics. Ahead of the election, the existence of Reform and pressure from Farage on issues like tax and migration had already forced the Conservatives further to the right. Farage identified that irregular migration, particularly people crossing the English Channel in small boats from France, could become a major factor in an election campaign. His relentless campaigning on the issue forced the Conservatives to introduce the highly controversial Rwanda policy, which would see asylum seekers sent overseas for their claims to be processed. The Conservative Party now needs to find a new leader. The debate over who takes over from Sunak will focus largely on what values the party should embrace. Many Conservatives will believe that by leaning to the right they can steal Farage\u2019s votes. Many will believe that some kind of pact should be done with Farage. Others will want absolutely nothing to do with a man who has spent decades attempting to destroy the Conservative Party. Regardless, it is likely that Farage will play a starring role in the Conservative leadership campaign. Even if he isn\u2019t in the party himself, Farage thrives as an outsider. The majority of his political success to date has all come without him holding a UK parliamentary seat. Now he has not only won a seat himself, but will have a small band of colleagues ready to hurl grenades at Labour leader and new Prime Minister Keir Starmer. That said, it is probably quite a long time before there is any kind of coherently united right. It is possible that Farage\u2019s splitting of the right has actually helped Starmer on his way to such a huge victory. An odd quirk of British politics is that the percentage of votes a party gets doesn\u2019t necessarily translate to seats. Every seat is decided individually, the winner being the candidate with the most votes, which is often less than 50%. And with Reform performing well in many of the seats that Labour won, the hard-right will not only be impossible to ignore in this parliament, but it could easily see its influence grow further. Britain suffers from many of the same problems as other European countries. If Starmer falters as prime minister, there is every chance that the popular right could continue to capture the public\u2019s imagination, as it has elsewhere\u00a0in Europe.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/europe/uk-election-europe-populist-surge-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "world"}}

Modi last met with Putin on the sidelines of the 2022 SCO meeting in Uzbekistan, when he told the Russian leader: \u201cNow is not the time for war.\u201d But while India has called for a cessation of hostilities in Ukraine and restoration of peace, it has also abstained from all resolutions on Ukraine at the United Nations and stopped short of condemning Russia\u2019s invasion. \u201cI look forward to reviewing all aspects of bilateral cooperation with my friend President Vladimir Putin and sharing perspectives on various regional and global issues,\u201d Modi said in a statement from his office before departing for Russia. \u201cWe seek to play a supportive role for a peaceful and stable region.\u201d Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, speaking in the wake of Russia\u2019s deadly attacks on Ukraine Monday, said it was a \u201chuge disappointment and a devastating blow to peace efforts to see the leader of the world\u2019s largest democracy hug the world\u2019s most bloody criminal in Moscow on such a day.\u201d Following Modi\u2019s arrival, Putin showed the Indian leader around his residence in Novo-Ogaryovo in the Moscow region. They greeted each other with a hug, chatted over tea and rode around in an electric vehicle. Putin also showed Modi the stables and they watched a horse show. The trip is Modi\u2019s first bilateral visit since winning a third consecutive term in a massive general election last month and is seen as a rare break in convention for an Indian leader who typically travels to neighboring countries such as Bhutan, Sri Lanka and Maldives. The visit also comes as Russia draws ever closer to China, potentially making New Delhi uncomfortable due to its longstanding Himalayan border dispute with Beijing, which has simmered in recent years. Modi\u2019s trip follows Putin\u2019s return from Kazakhstan, where the Russian leader last week attended the annual leaders\u2019 meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), a bloc of Eurasian countries spearheaded by China and Russia, at which he claimed\u00a0Moscow-Beijing relations were experiencing \u201cthe best period in their history.\u201d For India, that burgeoning relationship is \u201ca matter of deep concern,\u201d\u00a0said Nandan Unnikrishnan, a fellow at the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi. \u201cThat is one of the reasons that Mr. Modi is undertaking this trip because traditionally, the Soviet Union and then subsequently Russia, has been a balancer in our relationship with China, which has been not the best since the late \u201950s of the last century,\u201d he said. Despite India being an SCO member, Modi was visibly absent from the meeting in Kazakhstan, indicating to some analysts that the leader of the world\u2019s largest democracy does not view the bloc as an effective channel through which New Delhi can pursue its interests. Modi\u2019s visit to Russia is also widely seen as the latest dent in efforts by Western leaders to cast Putin aside. Despite undermining Western sanctions by purchasing large quantities of Russian oil, New Delhi has remained close with the United States, a key partner as both countries share concerns over China\u2019s assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific region. Modi met with US President Joe Biden during a\u00a0state visit to Washington\u00a0in June last year, in a trip further cementing their defense, trade and technology partnership. The Indian leader also addressed Congress during that trip, an honor typically reserved for close US allies and partners, and attended a lavish state dinner. India is a member of the Quad security grouping with the US, Japan and Australia. Later that year, Putin did not attend the Group of 20 leaders\u2019 summit in New Delhi, during which leaders delivered a consensus statement criticizing his invasion of Ukraine. Following his Russia trip, Modi will visit Austria in the Indian leader\u2019s first visit to the European nation, according to his office.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/asia/india-narendra-modi-russia-visit-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_04_uk_uk-election-results-tracker-map-2024-intl", "text": "The tectonic plates of British politics have shifted after Britons resoundingly voted to put an end to 14 years of Conservative rule, and deliver a landslide victory for the Labour Party. Labour\u2019s victory is bigger than the party could have imagined until fairly recently. At the last general election in 2019, it slumped to its worst defeat in more than 80 years and appeared set for a long period in the political wilderness. But the party has since rebuilt itself under the leadership of Keir Starmer, who will now become the next prime minister of the United Kingdom. Under Britain\u2019s first-past-the-post voting system, people in 650 constituencies across the nations of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have voted to select their member of parliament (MP) to represent the area, producing a flurry of results in the early hours of Friday morning before almost all the results were tallied later that day. The final result of the election will not be announced until Saturday morning, however, due to a recount in the Inverness, Skye and West Ross-shire constituency. A party needs 326 seats to officially win, a milestone that Labour cleared at around 5 a.m. local time on Friday, and the new government will have a commanding majority of more than 170 in the next parliament. Because of its electoral system, Britain can see large discrepancies between the share of seats won by a party and its share of the popular vote. If support for one party \u2013 or antipathy toward another \u2013 is spread fairly evenly across the country, it does not need to win a large share of the popular vote to win a huge majority of seats in parliament. Labour secured its landslide victory even as it won just about a third of the popular vote. The results represent one of the largest swings in British political history, and a stunning defeat for the Conservative Party after 14 years in government, bringing a brutal end to Rishi Sunak\u2019s premiership as his party lost around two-thirds of the 372 seats it was defending. Britain\u2019s traditional third party, the Liberal Democrats, also enjoyed a huge bump, going from just 11 seats won at the 2019 general election to more than 70 \u2013 its best result ever. Nigel Farage\u2019s right-wing, populist Reform UK party won its first five seats and came second in many more, splitting the right-wing vote and contributing to the Conservatives\u2019 losses. Meanwhile, in Scotland, the Scottish National Party (SNP) suffered a dismal night, with its number of seats slumping to just nine from 48 in 2019, as of Friday morning. Elsewhere across the UK, Sinn F\u00e9in became the largest Northern Irish party in parliament, winning seven of the 18 seats there. Its MPs do not take up their seats, as part of the party\u2019s refusal to recognize British sovereignty over Northern Ireland, given that it advocates for reuniting Northern Ireland with the Republic of Ireland in the south.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/uk/uk-election-results-tracker-map-2024-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_09_world_giant-pandas-san-diego-zoo", "text": "San Diego\u2019s newest giant pandas are acclimating well to their new state-side home, the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance said Tuesday. The zoo shared first-look photos of\u00a0the pair, Yun Chuan and Xin Bao, who\u00a0are the first giant pandas to enter the United States in 21 years, according to the zoo. Since their arrival in the Golden State on\u00a0June 27, the zoo says, \u201cThey are acclimating well to their new home in a private habitat and will not be viewable to the public for several weeks.\u201d Photos of the new residents show Yun Chuan chomping on leaves and Xin Bao lounging in her enclosure. Yun Chuan is a nearly 5-year-old male born to Zhen Zhen, the\u00a0fourth cub born at the San Diego Zoo. \u201cHe\u2019s identifiable by his long, slightly pointed nose and seems to\u00a0be extremely comfortable whether he is exploring on the grass or climbing trees,\u201d the zoo said in the release. Xin Bao is a nearly\u00a04-year-old female whose name means \u201cprecious treasure of prosperity and abundance.\u201d \u201cShe is best\u00a0recognized by her large, round face and big, fluffy ears, and she enjoys sunbathing quietly and focusing\u00a0on her favorite food,\u201d the zoo added. The young pandas are on loan from China after Chinese leader Xi Jinping suggested sending pandas to the San Diego Zoo as \u201cenvoys of friendship between the Chinese and American peoples.\u201d China loans pandas to more than 20 countries under a program often referred to as \u201cpanda diplomacy.\u201d Its panda loans to the US stretch back to 1972 \u2013 though the number of loans has decreased in recent years as US-China relations worsened. Over the past few years,\u00a0pandas from the\u00a0Memphis Zoo\u00a0and\u00a0Smithsonian National Zoo\u00a0in Washington, DC, were returned to China. The four giant pandas at\u00a0Zoo Atlanta\u00a0will go back to China later this year. But San Diego\u2019s agreement with China may represent a new phase in panda diplomacy; China announced in April it would also send pandas to the San Francisco Zoo for the first time. The San Diego Zoo, one of the world\u2019s most renowned, was the first American institution to carry out cooperative research on giant pandas with China. Since 1994, it has worked with the Sichuan conservation center to study the species\u2019 behavior, genetics, artificial breeding, nutrition and disease prevention. The San Diego Zoo said Tuesday it is working closely with Chinese experts to cater to the pandas\u2019 dietary needs, providing a variety of fresh bamboo and a local adaptation of wowotou, a traditional Chinese bun also called \u201cpanda bread.\u201d \u201cVeterinary teams from both countries are keeping a close eye on the\u00a0pandas\u2019 health, tracking their weight, appetite and other health indicators daily to ensure they thrive in\u00a0their new environment,\u201d the news release said. The San Diego Zoo also said that it will share more information about when visitors can see the pandas in person. The website said the pandas will spend several weeks acclimating to their new home. The pandas\u2019 health and care teams will determine when the pair is ready to meet the public.
