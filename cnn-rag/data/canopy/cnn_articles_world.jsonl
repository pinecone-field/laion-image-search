At least 274 Palestinians were killed in the operation and hundreds injured, Gazan authorities said, who do not distinguish between civilian and military casualties. While there has been euphoria for the families of the four rescued \u2013 Noa Argamani, Almog Meir Jan, Andrey Kozlov, and Shlomi Ziv, eight months after they were kidnapped from the Nova music festival on October 7 - celebrations could be brief. Israel\u2019s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu remains under intense pressure, with his goal of destroying Hamas and rescuing the remaining hostages still distant. He has refused to sign up to the latest peace plan, presented by US President Joe Biden last week, and the toll among Palestinians continues to rise. Here\u2019s what we know about Saturday\u2019s operation. What happened in the raid? Unusually, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) opted for a daytime raid on the Nuseirat camp in central Gaza on Saturday - saying that it allowed them a greater element of surprise. As part of their preparations, the military built models of the apartments the hostages were held in after receiving intelligence regarding their location. \u201cIsraeli forces have been preparing for this rescue mission for weeks. They underwent intensive training,\u201d Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari told a press briefing. Hagari said Israeli forces had to enter civilian areas to reach hostages as this was where Hamas had embedded itself. Some of the special forces were disguised as displaced Palestinians and as members of Hamas\u2019s military wing, according a witness as well as reporting from CNN analyst Barak Ravid, citing eyewitnesses in the refugee camp. CNN has\u00a0reached out to the IDF for comment. Without the cover of darkness, the IDF ran a greater risk of failing to get in and out of Gaza safely. One officer was shot and killed during the operation, according to Israeli police. Hagari said the IDF had received intelligence on the location of the hostages beforehand, noting that hostages in Gaza were frequently moved around and Argamani had previously been held elsewhere. Similar raids had been called off at the last minute \u201cmore than three or four times\u201d due to unfavorable conditions, he added. The first phase of Saturday\u2019s operation saw the IDF target militant infrastructure with pre-planned strikes, Hagari said. Hagari said that the IDF had come under intense fire, especially after withdrawing from the apartments, but did not provide evidence for his claims. \u201cWhile under fire, under fire inside the buildings, under fire on the way out from Gaza, our forces rescued our hostages,\u201d he said. Ravid, the CNN analyst, also reported there was a \u201crobust firefight\u201d after the hostages were rescued. Why was the Palestinian toll so high? The raid took place mid-morning, meaning the streets were teeming with people shopping at a nearby market. The hostages were held in civilian buildings, according to the IDF, in the midst of the densely populated camp. Hagari said the hostages had been locked in two separate apartments in multi-story buildings about 200 meters (650 feet) apart, with Argamani held in a different building to the three men. There were early indications of an ongoing mission when Israel announced ahead of the news on Saturday morning it was operating in Nuseirat, but it had launched a new offensive in the area midweek. Heavy bombardment was reported during the Israeli rescue mission. There are varying reports on the number of Palestinians killed. The latest figures from Gazan authorities say 274 Palestinians were killed and 698 injured \u2013 which would mark one of the deadliest days in months for people living in Gaza. The IDF has disputed those numbers, saying it estimated the number of casualties from the operation was \u201cunder 100.\u201d CNN cannot independently verify either side\u2019s figures. But local residents described the attack as a \u201chell on earth,\u201d with scenes of carnage following the strikes that led up to the rescue. Eyewitnesses have described civilians being struck down by airstrikes and shrapnel. One local Palestinian\u00a0man named Abu Abdallah told a CNN stringer on the ground that people were struck in their homes at around 5am local time. \u201cWe tried to get ambulances, but no\u00a0one could enter as it was already a military zone,\u201d he said. \u201cDogs were eating people\u2019s remains, we pulled out six martyrs, all torn up children and women, we risked our lives to get them to the hospital. The soldiers told us to go back but we had to continue,\u201d he added. Another local resident, Nidal Abdo, said he was shopping at\u00a0Nuseirat\u00a0market before \u201ca crazy bombardment started hitting everywhere.\u201d \u201c[It was] something we never witnessed before, maybe 150 rockets fell in less than 10 minutes, while we were running away more fell\u00a0on\u00a0the market,\u201d he said. Footage from\u00a0Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, in nearby Deir al-Balah, shows trucks and ambulances transferring injured people and bodies to the hospital. The hospital\u2019s emergency room is overwhelmed. People can be seen in the footage waiting\u00a0on\u00a0the hospital floor. Graphic video shows many Palestinians, including children, injured with blood on their faces and clothes. Footage from the hospital\u00a0also shows people screaming and crying, huddled over bodies covered in blankets. What\u2019s the reaction been? Families of the hostages expressed their overwhelming joy at having their loved ones returned safely. Orit Meir, mother\u00a0of\u00a0Almog Meir Jan, said at a news conference Saturday that she was excited to hug her son again. \u201cI couldn\u2019t stop hugging him,\u201d she said. \u201cTomorrow is my birthday so I got my present.\u201d Argamani was reunited with her terminally ill mother, who suffers from Stage 4 cancer. Netanyahu - who met with the rescued hostages and their families at Sheba Hospital on Saturday - called the operation \u201cheroic,\u201d adding that the government would continue \u201cto do everything we can\u201d to recover all those being held in the enclave. The operation was \u201ca great light in the terrible\u00a0darkness,\u201d Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid said Saturday. Avi Marciano, father of Corporal Noa Marciano, a 19-year-old hostage who died in captivity, said Netanyahu\u2019s public celebrations over the hostage releases contrasted with how he reacted when the outcome was not as positive. \u201cI am truly happy from the bottom of my heart for the families that were fortunate and able to hug their loved ones. I\u2019m also envious,\u201d Haaretz quoted him as saying. \u201cThis emphasizes how bad our ending was. When the ending is bad, the prime minister doesn\u2019t show up. He doesn\u2019t call, either.\u201d Hamas meanwhile accused\u00a0Israel\u00a0of committing \u201ca horrific massacre\u201d on civilians in Nuseirat. The militant group said\u00a0Israel\u2019s killing of scores of people as it mounted a hostage rescue operation was a \u201cbrutal crime, devoid of the values of civilization and humanity.\u201d   Palestinian\u00a0leader\u00a0Mahmoud Abbas has called for an emergency session of the\u00a0UN\u00a0Security Council while several MIddle Eastern countries condemned the operation. After the rescue mission, US national\u00a0security adviser\u00a0Jake Sullivan said an \u201cenduring ceasefire\u201d deal\u00a0between Israel and Hamas is \u201cthe only credible path forward.\u201d Sullivan acknowledged the civilian toll of Israel\u2019s military operation Saturday while saying Hamas, which took the hostages during its deadly October 7 attacks on Israel, was putting Palestinians in harm\u2019s way. What does it mean for the war? Hostage rescues are rare. This is only the third such successful operation of the conflict. Saturday\u2019s operation shows they are still possible and may encourage further efforts from the Israeli military, given a major goal of Israel\u2019s Gaza offensive is to rescue the remaining hostages. However some have pointed to a ceasefire deal as a much more effective way of freeing the hostages. More than 100 hostages were freed under a temporary truce last year, while Israel has rescued seven hostages by military means. Hagai Levine, of the health team at the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, said operations such as the one seen on Saturday were \u201cnot a way we can bring 120 hostages back home. \u201cWe must, all of us together, the world, follow President Biden speech and go with the deal that will enable all of them, dead or alive, come back home with a ceasefire.\u201d Instead, Levine called for a ceasefire deal that would \u201cenable all of [the hostages], dead or alive\u201d to be brought back home. There are warnings that the IDF\u2019s deadly operation on Saturday may have further set back a potential ceasefire agreement. An Egyptian official told CNN that Israel\u2019s operation will have a \u201cnegative effect\u201d on negotiations to end the war in Gaza. \u201c[It] won\u2019t be easy,\u201d the Egyptian official, who is familiar with the talks, told CNN. Egypt, along with Qatar, has been helping to coordinate negotiations between Israel and Hamas. On Sunday, the US called for a vote on its UN Security Council resolution backing the proposal for a permanent ceasefire and release of the hostages in\u00a0Gaza. \u201cIsrael has accepted this proposal and the Security Council has an opportunity to speak with one voice and call on Hamas to do the same,\u201d Nate Evans, the spokesperson for the US Mission to the UN, said in a statement Sunday. \u201cDoing so would help save lives and the suffering of civilians in\u00a0Gaza\u00a0as well as the hostages and their families,\u201d he said. Since November, intensive negotiations over a ceasefire and a deal to swap hostages for Palestinian prisoners have landed in a stalemate. Israel last month pressed ahead with its ground operation in central Rafah despite\u00a0international condemnation\u00a0for its escalation in the southern Gaza city where some\u00a01.3 million Palestinians\u00a0were taking shelter before Israel began its operation there.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/09/middleeast/israel-hostage-rescue-gaza-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_10_africa_sudans-al-fashir-main-hospital-shut-intl", "text": "Sudanese paramilitary forces stormed the main hospital in North Darfur, opening fire and looting vital medical supplies, Doctors Without Borders (MSF) have reported. Fighters from the Rapid Support Forces (RSF)\u00a0plundered the facility on Saturday stealing an ambulance among other supplies, the aid agency said. \u201cOn Saturday, MSF and the Ministry of Health suspended all activities in South Hospital, El Fasher, North Darfur, after RSF soldiers stormed the facility, opened fire, and looted it, including stealing an MSF ambulance,\u201d MSF Sudan said on social media Saturday. The hospital was the only one in the region \u201cequipped to deal with mass casualties\u201d and \u201cwas the main referral hospital for treating war-wounded.\u201d It was also one of the two hospitals in El Fasher with surgical capacity, according to MSF. As a result, patients are being moved to Paediatric and Saudi hospitals \u201cwhich were unprepared for such an influx,\u201d it added. Video posted on an apparent RSF \u201cX\u201d account shows armed men at the front gate of South Hospital. The footage was geolocated by CNN and shows at least one man firing an AK-style weapon on hospital grounds. According to MSF\u2019s statement posted on Twitter,\u00a0only ten patients and a small medical team were at the hospital\u00a0when it was attacked. Medical teams had already begun transferring patients and services to other facilities earlier in the week after intensified fighting in the region, the MSF said. Images posted to social media and verified by CNN show damaged medical equipment strewn in and around the facility. In one video, an armed man poses inside what appears to be an ambulance parked outside South Hospital. It is unclear whether the vehicle belonged to MSF. CNN has reached out to the RSF for comment. MSF said most patients and the remaining medical team, which included all MSF staff, were able to flee the violence but they are unable to say for certain if there were any casualties due to the chaos that ensued. South Hospital is the latest medical facility to fall into warring factions\u2019 crosshairs in Darfur. The medical facility had already been hit by mortar shells and bullets multiple times in the preceding weeks between May 25th\u00a0and June 3rd\u00a0resulting in two deaths and 14 injuries among patients and caretakers, according to MSF. On May 11, nearby Babiker Nahar Paediatric Hospital was impacted by an SAF airstrike 50 meters from the facility, per an MSF press release. Two children and a care giver in the intensive care unit were killed in the strike after a roof collapsed. \u201cIt is outrageous that the RSF opened fire inside the hospital. This is not an isolated incident, as staff and patients have endured attacks on the facility for weeks from all sides, but opening fire inside a hospital crosses a line,\u201d said MSF\u2019s Head of Emergencies Michel Lacharite, as quoted by MSF Sudan on X Saturday. \u201cWarring parties must halt attacks on medical care. Hospitals are closing. Remaining facilities can\u2019t handle mass casualties. We are trying to find solutions. The responsibility is on warring parties to spare medical facilities,\u201d Lacharite added. Spokesperson for Foreign Affairs & Security Policy of the EU Nabila Massrali\u00a0said on X Sunday,\u00a0\u201cThe EU is appalled by RSF-Janjaweed assault of staff at the El Fasher South Hospital in Darfur also looting it, as it did with many other hospitals in Sudan.\u201d \u201cWe remind again the [RSF] to show restraint and respect International Humanitarian Law,\u201d she added. The United Nations (UN) has said\u00a0that El Fasher hosts around 1.8 million people who are at \u201cimminent risk of famine.\u201d The UN\u2019s International Organization for Migration (IOM)\u00a0said an escalation in fighting from April 1st\u00a0this year between the warring RSF and Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) was monitored across El Fasher, displacing almost 130,000 people in just April and May this year. Civil war in Sudan between the SAF and RSF broke out in April 2023. According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, since the war\u2019s outbreak more than 8.8 million people have fled their homes and 24.8 million people are in need of assistance.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/africa/sudans-al-fashir-main-hospital-shut-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_middleeast_australian-billionaire-gaza-aid-gate-system-intl", "text": "An Australian billionaire is offering to build a secure gate system on the Israel-Gaza border that he says could allow 10,000 metric tons of food aid to be delivered each day to starving Palestinians. Andrew Forrest, founder of the philanthropic Minderoo Foundation, was set to raise the proposal Tuesday at an emergency summit on Gaza in Jordan, co-hosted by that country, Egypt and the United Nations, and attended by\u00a0US Secretary of State Antony Blinken. He\u2019s also committed $5 million to improve the Jordanian humanitarian land corridor by building storage warehouses to allow more aid to pass\u00a0to Gaza. \u201cRight now, the Jordanian people are bearing a significant load by leading the single most effective route into Gaza. It is my intention to lighten their load,\u201d Forrest, a mining magnate\u00a0and avowed eco-warrior,\u00a0said in a statement. According to a video presentation on its website, Minderoo said the more ambitious plan, to build SafeGates at three points along the Israel-Gaza border, could be up and running in three weeks, if Israel gives the green light. In a separate statement, Forrest said the project had been devised in\u00a0consultation with Israel and Palestinian communities for the past two months. CNN has asked Israel for comment on the plan. The presentation added that the project has been developed by Fortescue, the iron ore mining and green energy company of which Forrest is the founder and executive chairman. SafeGates\u00a0involves installing three remotely monitored access points at undisclosed locations on the Israel-Gaza border to conduct 3D scans of trucks\u00a0delivering aid to the region as they arrive and depart. \u201cBeing located at crossing points into Gaza, the gates will be operated by a third party that will have remote monitoring capabilities over the facilities and scanning equipment and determine the\u00a0gates\u2019 operational hours,\u201d\u00a0Forrest said in the statement. \u201cThere is no cost to Israel and the plan respects red lines. On the Gazan side, we will work with the existing network of agencies, businesses, as well as Palestinian community groups for aid distribution within the Strip,\u201d he added. The deliveries would supplement other efforts to deliver aid to Palestinians who have been living under sustained bombardment by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) since Hamas militants launched a deadly attack on Israel last October. During that attack, Hamas-led\u00a0militants killed around 1,200 Israelis and took more than 250 hostages. After the\u00a0rescue of four hostages earlier this week,\u00a0around 116 are believed to still be in Gaza, alive or dead. Israel\u2019s efforts to eradicate Hamas have killed more than\u00a037,000 Palestinians since October 7, according to the Ministry of Health. The IDF has repeatedly said hundreds of trucks carrying humanitarian aid have been entering the Gaza Strip, but aid organizations say the supplies are not reaching civilians in need. How would it work? A video of the\u00a0SafeGates\u00a0system shows trucks driving at an automated entry gate, where they undergo a 3D scan to identify any security issues, before being allowed to enter a secure compound. Once in the holding area, the driver leaves via a door back to Israel, while another door opens on the Gaza side, allowing a driver from the Palestinian enclave to drive the truck out of the compound. According to the video, the truck would be scanned again on the Gaza side, and once cleared, the cabin would be detached from its trailer\u00a0for the unloading of the aid,\u00a0 before reattaching and returning to\u00a0Israel via the same process. The system would work to prevent unauthorized access to the vehicles, allaying fears that aid deliveries could present an opportunity for potential attackers to cross the border. The passage of aid into Gaza has become gridlocked by Israeli inspections, and in some cases the temporary closure of access points. The US has attempted to provide aid to Gaza via airdrops, and more recently by building a floating pier to allow the delivery of supplies from various countries by boat. However, a week after its started operation, the pier broke apart in rough seas, temporarily halting aid deliveries while damaged portions were towed to Israel for repairs.\u00a0It was\u00a0reconnected last Friday. Humanitarian crisis International condemnation of Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza is growing and on Monday\u00a0the United Nations Security Council\u00a0overwhelmingly approved a US-backed ceasefire plan. However, Israel vowed to continue its military operation in Gaza, saying it won\u2019t engage in \u201cmeaningless\u201d negotiations with Hamas. Meanwhile, mass hunger has created a secondary peril for Palestinians living\u00a0within\u00a0the besieged strip. In a recent\u00a0report, the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET), said it was \u201cpossible, if not likely\u201d that the threshold for a famine had been passed in northern Gaza in April. The thresholds to confirm a famine are an extreme lack of food in households, acute malnutrition and mortality. FEWS NET, funded by the US Agency for International Development, is a leading provider of early warning and analysis on acute food insecurity around the world. It said it wasn\u2019t possible to confirm a famine in the north because it was too dangerous to deploy people there to gather data, but it warned that conditions will worsen if more aid is not delivered soon. \u201cIt is possible\u00a0famine will persist through at least July if there is not a fundamental change in how food assistance is distributed and accessed after entering Gaza,\u201d the report warned.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/middleeast/australian-billionaire-gaza-aid-gate-system-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_americas_us-migrants-mexico-election-intl-latam", "text": "Norma regrets ever having called the police. A shop owner and local coordinator for a political party on the outskirts of Mexico City, Norma called authorities in November\u00a0to file a complaint about noise coming from the building next door to her house. The building was being used by a rival political party, she believes. Norma doesn\u2019t know what resulted from the police investigation, but the 35-year-old began receiving intimidating threats. Strange men began to approach her in the street and warn she didn\u2019t have long to live, she said. She tried moving to a relative\u2019s house, but noticed that she was being followed on the way. When that rival party won the municipal elections two weeks ago, Norma decided to leave town, she said, fearing that she would be further targeted. \u201cAfter the vote, it got ugly in my city,\u201d she said. CNN is using only\u00a0her first name due to concerns for her safety. CNN met Norma on a dusty road in southern Arizona, just moments after she and her three children\u00a0\u2013 13, 8 and 2 years old \u2013 climbed across the low fence that separates Mexico from the United States. They are among several migrant families on the border who told CNN\u00a0they were fleeing the fallout of Mexico\u2019s bloody national elections, which saw dozens of political candidates assassinated and hundreds threatened on the campaign trail. All said they hoped for asylum from the US government. And all said they had not heard of a new executive order by US President Joe Biden blocking asylum requests from most people illegally crossing the southern border during periods of high volume. A few miles east along the border, CNN met several more Mexican families who had been sheltering for days in a tent erected by a local humanitarian group. Bottles of water had been left out for them, along with signs warning to wait for Border Patrol agents to show up, rather than attempt to walk any further\u00a0under the hot sun. Some were fleeing general violence, a lack of jobs, kidnapping threats made to their families.\u00a0Two men with a family sitting on the ground in the stifling heat said they too had fled Mexico following the elections. They had received threats for supporting the wrong candidate in their town, one said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t vote for the candidate \u2013 they were forcing us to.\u201d A wave of political killings and threats US officials have been keeping watch for new migration surges this summer. The violence surrounding Mexico\u2019s election this month is just one of many factors pushing some families to try to cross the border. \u201cWhether we\u2019re talking about elections in Mexico or here in the US, it always provokes a level of uncertainty with everyone, generally, but especially in the migrant population,\u201d a Homeland Security official previously told CNN. The June 2 vote was the biggest and most violent\u00a0in Mexico\u2019s history. With 20,000 electoral positions up for grabs, the scale of bloodshed committed by those attempting to influence the vote was massive; at least\u00a034 political candidates assassinated by criminal organizations during the campaign season. A May 28 report by research group Integralia identified 749 victims of political violence in Mexico, including 231 killings. Hundreds of candidates reported being threatened,\u00a0and many dropped out of their races, fearing for their lives. Intimidation was particularly pervasive in local-level elections, experts told CNN, where races could hand the winners broad control over small communities\u2019 police and fiscal resources. \u201cThe violence and threats were being done specifically to have the impact of saying that this party or these people or this group \u2013 whatever it may be \u2013 is in control here. To create that environment of fear,\u201d said Carin Zissis, a Mexico expert and editor-in-chief of the Americas Society/Council\u2019s website. Zissis told CNN she was not surprised political violence might be displacing some Mexicans from their homes today, given a broader security crisis in the country, where the\u00a0homicide rate\u00a0is one of the highest in the world. Hundreds of people faced threats during the election campaign, she said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking the candidates themselves, politicians in the parties, officials in the parties, violence against family members of candidates. So you can imagine that the issue of violence in general in Mexico \u2013 which is potentially getting people to leave their communities and flee \u2013 this could overlap with political violence as well,\u201d she said. Even while ballots were being counted, the attacks continued. One mayor, Yolanda S\u00e1nchez Figueroa of Cotija in Michoac\u00e1n state,\u00a0was assassinated the day after the election, while she was walking from a gym back to her house with her bodyguard. Both were\u00a0shot\u00a0dead\u00a0by people in a white van, the state attorney general said in a statement. US-Mexico cooperation on border control Mexico has worked closely with the US to ease\u00a0migratory pressure at the border, with multiple state agencies working to block or redirect asylum-seekers from around the world away from the US-Mexico border. But conditions at home appear to be pushing some Mexican citizens to join the northward flow. Salvador Guerrero, director of the Alaide Foppa Refugee Legal Clinic in Mexico City, said he worries the government\u2019s commitment to serving as a migration buffer for its northern neighbor has siphoned away resources and attention from interior security work. \u201cFor example, the National Guard was created to protect Mexico,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cBut for each criminal that the National Guard present to a judge, there are 80 migrants that they also present to relocate people\u00a0from the north to the south,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, impunity reigns in Mexico, where in addition to the high homicide rate, more than 100,000 people have gone missing\u00a0with no explanation of their fate. According to think tank\u00a0Mexico Evalua,\u00a0around 95%\u00a0of all crimes nationwide\u00a0went unsolved in\u00a02022. And while outgoing President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador\u2019s social welfare programs have lifted many Mexicans out of poverty, the erosion of democratic guardrails and institutions under his watch are piling pressure on those who find themselves on the wrong side politically. High on Lopez Obrador\u2019s agenda before he leaves office is a list of reforms, many of which are expected to have a weakening effect on the day-in, day-out work of democratic institutions in the country, pointed out Zissis, the AS/COA editor. These include eliminating proportional representation of legislators, gutting of autonomous regulatory agencies, and direct election of Supreme Court justices. The ruling Morena party says such\u00a0measures are designed to create a more direct democracy, but critics say they will erode\u00a0checks and balances in the government. \u201cThese may seem like tedious questions but they have a real impact on the country\u2019s democracy and the ability of opposition parties to still have a voice,\u201d Zissis said. President-elect Claudia Sheinbaum will begin her presidency on October 1. Widely seen as the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Lopez Obrador, whether she will continue in his footprints on security, border control and government reform are key questions amid historic levels of migration through North America. Sent back with little fanfare To reach Arizona, Norma\u2019s family took a flight to Hermosillo, and then a truck to a frontier town in the scorching Sonoran desert before eventually crossing the border on foot. She said they walked through dry scrub and mesquite trees for about 20 minutes before reaching a ditch filled with the\u00a0abandoned water bottles, diapers, ID cards and clothing \u2013 left\u00a0by the hundreds of migrants who had already reached the land of the free. Her children were protective as Norma stopped to chat with CNN, her 13-year-old worried that\u00a0people in Mexico would see her mother\u2019s picture on television. Even the two-year-old hugged her leg and pulled at her shirt, trying to hurry her along. \u201cMama,\u201d the toddler squeaked. \u201cVamos.\u201d But the tent at the end of the road would be a long walk for little legs. The temperature was 111 degrees Fahrenheit (43.8 Celsius). They would find no food, water, or air conditioning there \u2013 just dozens of other dazed looking families sprawled on the floor, waiting to be apprehended so that they could tell someone why they were there. For most people crossing that border\u00a0illegally\u00a0today, requesting asylum is no longer an option, no matter what their circumstances. US President Joe Biden\u2019s\u00a0proclamation\u00a0bars migrants who cross the border illegally from seeking asylum once a daily threshold of illegal crossings is met. Though asylum seekers can still use a Customs and Border Protection app to request an appointment to present their asylum claim at a port of entry. It\u2019s a controversial measure. Critics argue the change\u00a0doesn\u2019t go far enough\u00a0in stemming the vast numbers of people entering the country that far exceeds the capacity of US immigration systems. Immigrant\u00a0rights advocates warn closing the\u00a0border\u00a0to\u00a0asylum\u00a0seekers\u00a0endangers\u00a0vulnerable people\u00a0and ultimately makes the\u00a0border\u00a0less safe. Norma and her kids were detained by Border Patrol on Friday after entering the US.\u00a0By Monday, they had been deported to Mexico, where she says they are afraid to leave the house, and her kids are not going to school.

{"id": "2024_06_10_asia_chinese-military-harass-dutch-warship-intl-hnk-ml", "text": "A Dutch warship\u00a0was harassed by Chinese military aircraft in the East China Sea on Friday,\u00a0the Netherlands said, becoming the latest\u00a0country to accuse Beijing\u2019s forces of initiating potentially unsafe encounters in international waters. In a statement Friday, the Dutch Defense Ministry said two Chinese fighter jets circled the frigate HNLMS Tromp several times, while its marine patrol helicopter was \u201capproached\u201d by two Chinese warplanes and a helicopter during a patrol. \u201cThis created a potentially unsafe situation,\u201d the statement said. CNN has asked the Chinese government for comment on the Dutch accusations. The Tromp was operating in the East China Sea in support of a multinational coalition enforcing United Nations sanctions on North Korea, known as the Pacific Security Maritime Exchange (PSMX), according to a statement from the European Union. The UN Security Council has passed multiple resolutions since 2006 imposing sanctions on North Korea for its nuclear weapons program. PSMX partner nations include Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, the United Kingdom and the United States, according to the US State Department. Before patrolling in the East China Sea, the Dutch frigate had made a port call in Busan, South Korea, where it participated in exercises with the South Korean Navy, the EU statement said. Tromp joins a growing list of vessels and aircraft that have accused China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army of conducting possibly unsafe maneuvers in the East and South China Seas and beyond in recent years. Last month, Australia accused a Chinese fighter jet of firing flares into the path of a naval helicopter operating from the destroyer HMAS Hobart over international waters of the Yellow Sea. The Hobart was also enforcing UN sanctions on North Korea. \u201cThis was an unsafe maneuver which posed a risk to the aircraft and personnel,\u201d a statement from Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles said at the time. China defended that action by its military and rejected Australia\u2019s claim that the interception was unsafe. \u201cUnder the guise of implementing United Nations Security Council resolutions, Australian warships and aircraft deliberately approached China\u2019s airspace to cause trouble and provocation, endangering China\u2019s maritime and air security,\u201d Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian told reporters at a regular briefing last month. \u201cAs a warning, the Chinese military took necessary measures at the scene. Relevant operations are legal, compliant, professional and safe.\u201d The incident was similar to\u00a0an encounter\u00a0in late October, when Canada said a Chinese fighter jet fired flares into the path of a Canadian military helicopter over the South China Sea. \u201cThe risk to a helicopter in that instance is the flares moving into the rotor blades or the engines so this was categorized as both unsafe and non-standard, unprofessional,\u201d Maj. Rob Millen, air officer aboard the Royal Canadian Navy frigate HMCS Ottawa, told CNN after the October incident. China also defended its actions in that incident and accused Canadian forces of conducting an unspecified \u201cmalicious and provocative act with ulterior motives.\u201d Two weeks before the South China Sea encounter, a Royal Canadian Air Force patrol plane reported an unsafe intercept by a Chinese jet while it was supporting the UN enforcement of sanctions on North Korea. China, which says its forces act in accordance with international law while protecting Chinese interests, has repeatedly claimed that US-led alliances in the Pacific are a threat to its security. Earlier this month in a speech to the Shangri-La Dialogue defense summit in Singapore, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Washington had made \u201chistoric progress\u201d in developing alliances and partnerships that have enhanced security in Asia in the past three years. In a Q&A session, a Chinese colonel asked Austin whether the US is planning to build a NATO-like alliance system in the Asia-Pacific region, and also blamed NATO for the Ukraine war. Hours later, a Chinese military spokesman accused the United States of \u201ccreating division and provoking confrontation\u201d in the region. \u201cThe US keeps creating chaos and has become the source of risks, as well as the destroyer to peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region,\u201d Jing Jianfeng, deputy chief of the Joint Staff Department at China\u2019s Central Military Commission, told reporters in Singapore.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/asia/chinese-military-harass-dutch-warship-intl-hnk-ml/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_08_tech_hong-kong-uber-taxis-intl-hnk", "text": "They hire their Uber through the app just like any other passenger, and hop in the back of the car. But halfway through the ride, the mood changes and they reveal their identity. \u201cPull over here. It\u2019s you. You are in trouble for driving an Uber,\u201d the passenger tells his driver, during one of a few recent encounters captured in video and circulated online in Hong Kong. The passengers aren\u2019t traffic cops. They are vigilante taxi drivers taking direct action, having become increasingly frustrated about Hong Kong authorities\u2019 failure to regulate the ride-hailing platform. After the car pulls over, they hand over the driver, often still reeling in shock, to the police officers they have called. \u201cYou may say this is provocative. But without these videos, people may think we inflate the numbers of \u2018white-plate vehicles\u2019 out there,\u201d one of the taxi drivers who took part in a sting operation, and asked to be only identified as Ka Chun, told CNN. \u201cWhite-plate vehicles\u201d is how taxi drivers colloquially refer to Uber. \u201cWe just want the government to enforce the law.\u201d Uber (UBER) remains technically illegal in Hong Kong, which it entered in 2014. But it has thrived under the ambiguous approach of officials keen to project an image of technological modernity. \u201cUber is often framed as innovation, which seems to contribute to the \u2018smart city\u2019 vision \u2013 something that the Hong Kong government has strived to be,\u201d said Oliver Chan, an assistant communications studies professor who specializes in the gig economy at Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK). Ads for the US-headquartered company are widespread, and its drivers are highly unlikely to face problems with the authorities. Taxi drivers have for years complained about how Uber has flouted local laws, upended the market, and chipped away their already modest earnings. But their recent acts of vigilantism appear to have backfired. Instead of rallying public support, the cabbies were on the receiving end of a backlash, with passengers taking to social media to share their bad experiences of rude taxi drivers, ride rejections and opportunistic charging during heavy rains and the city\u2019s regular summer typhoons. \u201cThey charge arbitrarily and refuse to take passengers. And yet, they have the audacity to go on sting operations,\u201d one person wrote on LIHKG, a popular local internet forum, adding: \u201cShameless people know no bounds.\u201d Others have retaliated by reporting law-breaking taxi drivers to police. Pictures of taxis parking in restricted areas flooded the internet in posts calling for people to report them. WhatsApp groups set up by Uber drivers also discuss how to retaliate, one driver told CNN. So tense is the backlash that Hong Kong leader John Lee, when asked about the furor by reporters last week, acknowledged the \u201cfierce public debate\u201d and appealed for calm. He urged taxi drivers to stay away from any vigilante acts. As with New York\u2019s amber-painted medallion taxis and London\u2019s black hackney cabs, Hong Kong\u2019s 15,000 red urban taxis are emblematic of the city. But they are not exactly known for their friendliness or reliable service. Passenger Lau Chi-tim recalled being charged double during a typhoon a few years ago. Drivers often charge a little more because their insurance does not cover extreme weather conditions. But Lau said: \u201cThe trip lasted only 15 minutes and most of the journey was inside a tunnel anyway. Where is the risk?\u201d Another passenger lamented how selective taxi drivers can be. \u201cPeople with pets, a pram, wanting to cross the harbor, or going anywhere that may be crowded\u2026 they just reject you,\u201d Jason Chan said. Similar complaints abound, despite refusal to take passengers being an offense under the Hong Kong law. Those who prefer Uber see it as an alternative to the poor service they have long tolerated and would rather pay a little more for a smoother ride. An Uber driver, who gave only his name Mo for fear of being identified by authorities, said passengers told him they preferred Uber drivers\u2019 manners, and quality of driving. \u201cWe don\u2019t dare swerve around on the road because it\u2019s our own vehicle,\u201d he said. But for Ka Chun, the driver who went undercover, it\u2019s about defending their interest and an institution that he and his fellow cabbies invested time and money to be part of. \u201cThey have an impact on us because these white-plate vehicles can take passengers without a taxi license,\u201d he said, speaking of a permit that can cost a fortune in the city where properties, and even parking spaces, are traded as speculative commodities. Hong Kong\u2019s transport authority has issued some 18,000 taxi licenses \u2013 including for non-urban blue and green cabs - and they are currently traded for up to $400,000 (HK$3.2 million) in a free market. Annual insurance for a taxi also costs up to 10 times that for private vehicles. Drivers who don\u2019t own a taxi pay rental of 550 Hong Kong dollars (about $70) for a 12-hour shift, almost a third of what they make on an average day, according to Ka Chun. \u201cUber drivers don\u2019t need any capital whatsoever as they are using their own car to take passengers,\u201d he said. Patrick Tam, secretary general of the Hong Kong Taxi & Public Light Bus Association, acknowledged the complaints against some unruly taxi drivers, and said he supported the police going after them. \u201cThese taxi drivers should face tough punishment. But it doesn\u2019t make vehicles operating without a proper license less of a problem,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just want fair treatment.\u201d So far, Hong Kong police have said they had not arrested any Uber drivers ensnared in the amateur sting operations. Estyn Chung, general manager of Uber in Hong Kong, noted that the company launched its Uber Taxi service in 2020 to give riders the option to get a taxi on its app. \u201cWe know from elsewhere around the world that taxi and ride-sharing services can thrive alongside each other. Hong Kong is not an exception,\u201d he said. Creating harmony between traditional cabbies and gig-economy drivers can be tricky. And CUHK\u2019s Chan said that, after years of ambiguity, Hong Kong is already playing catch-up. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to say the extent to which the government wants to promote Uber, and more broadly, ride-hailing platforms at this point,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Hong Kong\u2019s ride-hailing regulations lag behind, for example, Singapore.\u201d The city government is expected to unveil a study on online ride-hailing services in July. A spokesman said it is \u201copen-minded\u201d on the apps, though \u201cthey must be in compliance with the relevant law and regulations.\u201d \u201cThe government should require them to get a different driver permit and insurance even if it legalizes their operation,\u201d said Ka Chun. \u201cOtherwise, why should I get a taxi license? I could drive white-plate vehicles.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/08/tech/hong-kong-uber-taxis-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_middleeast_hamas-responds-hostage-deal-intl-latam", "text": "Talks to bring about a ceasefire and hostage deal that could stop the war in Gaza were thrown into doubt when Israel characterized a Hamas response to the latest proposal as a rejection,\u00a0precipitating a blame game between the two sides. Hamas had submitted its response to Qatari mediators, proposing amendments to the Israeli proposal, including a timeline for a permanent ceasefire and complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, a source with knowledge of the talks told CNN on Tuesday. A diplomatic source familiar with ongoing negotiations, however, told CNN Wednesday that Hamas has neither accepted nor rejected the deal, and that framing the Hamas response as a rejection is misleading. Speaking at a news conference in Doha on Wednesday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that \u201cHamas has proposed numerous changes to the proposal that was on the table\u201d for a permanent ceasefire and release of the hostages. \u201cSome of the changes are workable. Some are not,\u201d he said, without providing further details. Blinken said he discussed the changes with Egyptian and Qatari partners, but stressed that the proposed deal \u201cwas virtually identical\u201d to a proposal that Hamas previously accepted. \u201cHamas could have answered with a single word \u2013 yes,\u201d he said, adding that as\u00a0Hamas proposed more changes,\u00a0he questioned whether the group is negotiating \u201cin good faith.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s time for the haggling to stop and a ceasefire to start. It\u2019s as simple as that,\u201d Blinken said. Speaking alongside Blinken, Qatari Minister of Foreign Affairs Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al-Thani said that both Hamas and Israel have on different occasions been \u201ccounterproductive to the efforts.\u201d The Qatari official said that as a mediator, the Gulf state wants to \u201censure that we bridge the gap between those two fundamental differences; between what Hamas wants as a permanent ceasefire, and what Israel wants as a hostage release and maybe a plan to continue the war.\u201d After submitting its response Tuesday,\u00a0Hamas spokesman and political bureau member Osama Hamdan\u00a0told Lebanon-based TV Al Mayadeen, the group was committed to achieving a ceasefire. \u201cOur response is a clear reaffirmation of our commitment to the ceasefire and withdrawal from Gaza, a commitment we have consistently upheld,\u201d Hamdan\u00a0added. But in a potential sign of how Israel views the proposed amendments, one Israeli official described Hamas\u2019 response to the original deal as a rejection. \u201cIsrael received the Hamas answer from the mediators. In its response, Hamas rejected the outline of the deal for the release of the hostages presented by US President (Joe) Biden,\u201d the official told CNN. Other news organizations report the same initial Israeli response. Hamas leadership quickly pushed back on the claim as an attempt to back out of the proposal. \u201cThe response of Hamas and the Palestinian factions to the truce proposal was responsible, serious and positive. The response is consistent with the demands of our people and the resistance and opens the way to reaching an agreement,\u201d said Izzat al-Rishq, a member of the Hamas political bureau, late on Tuesday. \u201cThe Israeli media\u2019s incitement to Hamas\u2019s response is an indication of attempts to evade the agreement\u2019s obligations.\u201d\u00a0 The tensions are surfacing at a sensitive moment. Blinken\u00a0is\u00a0currently on a\u00a0diplomatic swing through the region trying to secure agreement on\u00a0the\u00a0plan first unveiled by President Biden eleven days ago. Blinken was up late into the night on Tuesday in Jordan reviewing Hamas\u2019s response to the latest Israeli proposal on the table that\u00a0his team received in-person from the\u00a0Egyptian intelligence chief Abbas Kamel, a senior state department official said Wednesday. Blinken, who was in Amman as part of his multi-country trip to the Middle East, sent two senior State Department officials on Tuesday night to meet with Kamel and receive the Hamas response, the official said. Assistant Secretary Barbara Leaf and Counselor Derek Chollet, the officials who met Kamel, then came back to brief Blinken at his hotel, the official said. The official would not characterize the contents of the Hamas response. The plan being negotiated, drafted by Israel, has not been made public in full. Endorsed by the United Nations Security Council on Monday, the plan\u00a0envisages\u00a0a six-week ceasefire - during which Hamas would release hostages and Israel would release Palestinian prisoners \u2013 that would evolve into a permanent cessation of hostilities through negotiations. The White House has been at pains to stress it is an Israeli plan and have repeatedly said that Israel has accepted it, despite objections from Israel\u2019s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Mixed signals in Israel Earlier Tuesday, Israel had made its clearest signal yet that it was poised to formally sign up to the plan - though in the same short statement it suggested it intended to maintain the freedom to keep fighting. The short Israeli communication, attributed only to an Israeli government official, though widely understood to mean the Prime Minister\u2019s Office, started with an assertion of Israel\u2019s war aims before expressing support for the US-backed proposal currently on the table. \u201cIsrael will not end the war before achieving all its war objectives: destroying Hamas\u2019s military and governing capabilities, freeing all the hostages and ensuring Gaza doesn\u2019t pose a threat to Israel in the future,\u201d it said. \u201cThe proposal presented enables Israel to achieve these goals and Israel will indeed do so,\u201d the statement concluded. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s oft-repeated promise of total victory and the elimination of Hamas did not get a mention. The Israeli leader is caught between the voices of many in his country, who believe a ceasefire deal is the best way to secure the release of the 120 hostages still held by Hamas in Gaza, and those of his extreme right coalition partners who are adamant they want the war to continue. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir have both threatened to collapse the government if Netanyahu agrees to the deal in its current form. By contrast, senior opposition figures like one-time war cabinet member Benny Gantz, and opposition leader Yair Lapid have also been among those urging Netanyahu to embrace the US-backed plan. Hamas has also been under pressure to get on board with the US-backed proposal but said last week it is concerned Israel might not go through with the second phase of the plan \u2013 a permanent end to the fighting. \u201cUnless there is a clear position [from Israel] to prepare for a permanent ceasefire and a total withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, which is what could open the door wide to completing the agreement\u2026 we cannot come to an agreement,\u201d Hamas spokesman\u00a0and political bureau member\u00a0Osama Hamdan warned last week.

{"id": "2024_06_07_americas_panama-migrants-darien-gap-intl-latam", "text": "Panamanian figures show at least 174,513 migrants crossed the treacherous Dari\u00e9n Gap, a mountainous rainforest region connecting South and Central America, from January to June 6 of this year. The latest figures are higher than around the same period in 2023, when more than 166,000 crossings were reported, according to Panama\u2019s National Migration Service. The Dari\u00e9n Gap, which a decade ago was seen as an almost impassable barrier, has continued to see an increase in the number of migrants willing to risk their lives and safety to cross it. According to migration service figures, a record 520,000 people crossed the jungle last year. Experts say many continue to journey towards the United States in search of better opportunities. The National Migration Service of Panama said Thursday that in the first six days of June 2024, at least 4,499 people \u2013 3,598 adults and 901 minors \u2013 arrived in the country. This comes as the number of children crossing the Dari\u00e9n Gap has increased by 40% this year, putting the route on track to see record levels of child migration for the fifth consecutive year, according to a report by the United Nations\u2019 children\u2019s agency. The UNICEF report added that in the first four months of 2024, over 30,000 children crossed the Dari\u00e9n Gap, and that 2,000 were unaccompanied or separated from their families. This comes as Panamanian politicians seek to harden the country\u2019s borders. During his election campaign, Panama\u2019s president-elect Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino said that he wanted to \u201cclose the Dari\u00e9n,\u201d citing safety concerns. He explained in early May that he had proposed to initiate \u201ca repatriation process with full respect for human rights\u201d for the hundreds of thousands of migrants who pass through the area each year. \u201cSo that those from there, and those who would like to come, know that those who arrive here will be returned to their country of origin,\u201d Mulino said. Mulino\u2019s plan may prove unfeasible given that the jungle is 266 kilometers (165 miles) long. Discouraging migrants from crossing could be a tough challenge since many of them pay human smugglers operating on both sides of the borders. \u201cIn practical terms, trying to reduce migration through the Dari\u00e9n is a difficult task. The complexity is not just about entry points, but how to manage and have better information on who is helping migrants get through,\u201d Ariel Ruiz, a policy analyst at the Washington-based Migration Policy Institute, told CNN. The 66-mile (106-kilometer) hike through the Darien Gap brings migrants from Colombia to Panama and is a crucial passage for those hoping to reach the United States and Canada. Mass migration across the Western Hemisphere has\u00a0fueled a growing number\u00a0of people moving north. The journey carries multiple risks for migrants, including robberies, assaults, kidnappings, diseases, wild animal attacks, and accidents in a jungle full of rivers, mountains, and mud flats, according to the UN Refugee agency, UNHCR.

Authorities identified the suspect only by his last name, Cui, who was describes as a 55-year-old man from the city\u2019s Longtan District. Police said he \u201ccollided with a foreigner while walking\u201d in Beishan Park, a popular green space\u00a0in the city center. The suspect then stabbed the instructors, as well as a Chinese tourist who stepped forward and tried to stop him during the incident, police said in a statement. Police said they received the call around 11:49 a.m. local time Monday, after which they dispatched officers to the scene and transported the injured to the hospital for treatment. The injured \u201chave all received proper medical treatment and are not in danger \u2026\u201d police said earlier. The educators from Cornell College, a private liberal arts college\u00a0in Mount Vernon, Iowa, were wounded \u201cin a serious incident\u201d\u00a0on Monday, while participating in a partnership program with Beihua University in Jilin, according to the college. \u201cWe have been in contact with all four instructors and are assisting them during this time,\u201d Cornell College President Jonathan Brand said in a statement, adding no students took part in the program. Footage purportedly showing the aftermath of the daylight attack emerged on Chinese social media on Monday but was swiftly censored. It showed two men and a woman lying on the ground covered in large blood stains, surrounded by onlookers. They appeared conscious and were talking on their cell phones, the video showed. CNN geolocated the video to Beishan Park, a popular green space\u00a0in Jilin city center, less than half an hour\u2019s drive from Beihua University. Monday was a public holiday in China. China\u2019s Foreign Ministry confirmed Tuesday that \u201cfour foreign teachers at Beihua University were attacked\u201d while visiting the park Monday morning \u2013 adding they were immediately taken to the hospital and did not suffer life-threatening injuries. Iowa state Rep. Adam Zabner told CNN his brother, David Zabner, was one of the victims of the stabbing. Zabner said his brother, who was on his second visit to China with Cornell, is \u201cdoing well\u201d and has \u201cbeen stitched up and seems to be recovering,\u201d after speaking to him on Tuesday morning Beijing time. The other three victims survived the attack, Adam Zabner said, adding he could not comment on their health status. \u201cI\u2019m just extremely grateful that my brother is OK and that he survived this attack,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cThe hope of my family is to get my brother back home as soon as possible and get them healthy. And we really just want to thank the US State Department for all their help, and also our federal delegation from Iowa who have been particularly helpful.\u201d The US State Department said it was aware of reports of a stabbing incident in China and is monitoring the situation. \u2018Horrifying attack\u2019 Knife attacks are not uncommon in China, where guns are tightly controlled. The country has faced a spate of stabbing rampages in public places including schools and hospitals. But public attacks against foreigners are rare. The attack in Jilin comes as China has been seeking to draw back international visitors following three years of stringent Covid-19 border controls. It also comes amid efforts to boost educational exchanges with the United States as the two countries look to stabilize their fraught relationship. The incident has drawn attention and concern in Iowa from officials and lawmakers. Gov. Kim Reynolds called it a \u201chorrifying attack.\u201d US Rep. Ashley Hinson, who represents the district where Cornell College is located, said the college employees \u201cwere brutally stabbed\u201d and vowed to \u201cdo everything in our power to bring these Iowans home safely.\u201d On China\u2019s heavily censored social media, visuals and discussions about the attack had been swiftly erased since Monday. Censorship appeared to have relaxed somewhat by noon Tuesday to allow some comments to surface. Some Chinese internet users called it a \u201cterrible\u201d incident, while others questioned why Chinese media was not reporting on the attack. Some also expressed concerns about its potential impact on China\u2019s global image and the willingness of foreigners to visit the country, amid a rise in nationalism and anti-American sentiment. At its news conference Tuesday, China\u2019s Foreign Ministry sought to dismiss concerns that the attack would affect educational exchanges between China and the US. \u201cCarrying out people-to-people and cultural exchanges between China and the United States is in the common interests of both sides and has received active support and response from various sectors in both countries,\u201d said Lin, the spokesperson. \u201cChina is widely recognized as one of the safest countries in the world. China has always taken effective measures and will continue to take relevant measures to effectively protect the safety of all foreigners in China.\u201d Study ties Cornell College began a partnership with Beihua University in 2018, which would see the Chinese institution provide funding for educators from the Iowa school to travel and live in China and teach a portion of a course in areas of computer science, math and physics over two-week periods, according to information posted on the college website at the time. China has been trying to boost its educational cooperation with the US, which has suffered considerable setbacks due to the Covid pandemic and bilateral tensions. During a visit to the US in November, Chinese leader Xi Jinping announced the country would invite 50,000 young Americans to China on exchange and study programs in the next five years to foster personal ties between the two countries. The Chinese leader noted his own enduring ties to the state of Iowa in his announcement. Xi stayed with a host family in Iowa during his first visit to the US nearly four decades ago, an experience he has described as \u201cunforgettable.\u201d Last week, Xi encouraged universities in China and the US to \u201cstrengthen exchanges and cooperation,\u201d in a letter to the president of Kean University in New Jersey, which has a China-based joint venture with Wenzhou University, according to state media. China has one of the lowest rates of violent crime in the world, partly due to its strict gun controls and powerful mass surveillance. But it has continued to face mass stabbings in public places. In May, two people were killed and another 21 injured in a knife attack in a hospital in the southwestern province of Yunnan. Last year, six people were killed and one injured in an early morning\u00a0stabbing incident\u00a0outside a kindergarten in southern Guangdong province.

The final four members of the group began their service in December 2023, with the band expected to reunite in 2025 after they all complete their duty. Jin plans to celebrate his discharge with an event in Seoul on Thursday where he will greet fans and stage a performance. BTS\u2019 label Hybe, which is putting on the event at the Jamsil Sports Complex, has selected 1,000 fans who will get to hug the star. BTS have become worldwide superstars since debuting in 2013, earning No. 1 singles in more than 100 countries, gaining more than 74 million followers on Instagram and being awarded Time magazine\u2019s Entertainer of the Year award in 2020. In 2022, the group visited the White House and spoke about Asian representation as well as anti-Asian hate crimes, which surged in the US during the pandemic. Beyond music, BTS members are bankable fashion icons. In 2021, Louis Vuitton named the group brand ambassadors and dressed them in complementary suits for the 64th Grammy Awards the next year. Suga and Jimin have starred in Valentino and Dior campaigns respectively. Dior\u2019s artistic director Kim Jones designed custom stage outfits for their 2019 tour. South Korea requires all able-bodied men between the ages of 18 and 28 to serve between 18 to 21 months in the military or social service, but it revised the law in 2020 to let globally recognized K-pop stars delay signing up until age 30.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/style/jin-bts-finishes-military-service-south-korea-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_02_style_aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl", "text": "Miami has a new addition to its skyline \u2013 a 66-story residential tower built by Aston Martin, marking the British luxury sports carmaker\u2019s first foray into the residential real estate market. Comprising of 391 units, Aston Martin Residences Miami sits at the mouth of the Miami River on Biscayne Bay, the firm said in a statement Tuesday. Designed in partnership with architect Rodolfo Miani of Bodas Mian Anger and built by G&G Business Developments, the 249-meter- (818-foot-) tall building houses seven penthouses, each with private pools and terraces, as well as apartments ranging in size from one to five bedrooms. The largest unit is the \u201cUnique Triplex Penthouse,\u201d arranged over three floors at the top of the building, which remains on the market for $59 million. The property was officially opened on Tuesday. Timed to coincide with the Formula One Miami Grand Prix, the company said in a statement that it marks \u201cthe latest distinct expression of Aston Martin\u2019s ultra-luxury high performance brand.\u201d Featuring an infinity pool with a pool deck, jacuzzis and cabanas on the 55th floor, the sail-shaped complex has a two-floor fitness center, two movie theaters and a virtual golf simulator. The building has a sky bar and lounge, chef\u2019s kitchen, ballroom and private dining areas, as well as a spa, beauty salon and barber shop. Direct access to the sea via a superyacht marina is also available, plus a private butler service. Germ\u00e1n Coto, chief executive officer of G&G Business Developments, told CNN Tuesday that the firm wanted to work on a project in the \u201ccosmopolitan city\u201d of Miami, and that this piece of land was the perfect choice. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing plot with an excellent view of the river,\u201d said Coto. The structure\u2019s aerodynamic shape helps the building deal with the technical challenges presented by high winds in the area, as well as evoking the sleek shape of an Aston Martin, according to Marek Reichman, executive vice president and chief creative officer of Aston Martin. It also becomes wider from the base to the mid-section before tightening once more towards the top, making it appear to bow out over people on street level, Reichman told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the drama,\u201d he added. Challenges However, the process wasn\u2019t all plain sailing. \u201cIt was difficult to achieve what we wanted because the space and the plot is kind of small,\u201d said Coto, with the building fitting into a 1.25-acre plot of land. Meanwhile, local building regulations imposed strict standards, explained Reichman, taking into account the low-lying land and propensity for flooding. \u201cThey were some of the most amazing challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to withstand the flooding with the windows that are on street level.\u201d There were further obstacles due to the curved shape of the building, which means that units on the east side have an individual architectural structural component. Aston Martin touches Homeowners are able to customize their interior space with the help of the Aston Martin design team, with three style packages \u2013 Timeless, Covert and Indulgent \u2013 drawing on the company\u2019s British heritage, as well as the building\u2019s context. \u201cIt needs to have part of the DNA of an Aston Martin,\u201d Reichman said. \u201cBut we are in Miami, you don\u2019t have a cold November evening where you need to put the log fire on, so you\u2019ve got to be considerate of the environment that you\u2019re in.\u201d Design elements running through the building include doors with bespoke Aston Martin handles, number plinths and kestrel tan leather door tabs. Aston Martin said that 99% of the properties sold before the building was completed. Residences were sold for $1.5 million to $8.5 million, while penthouses ranged from $16 million to $59 million. The Unique Triplex Penthouse, on the market for $59 million, comes with the last remaining Aston Martin Vulcan, an 820 brake horsepower all-carbon fiber supercar, of which only 24 exist, a spokesman for the company said. Meanwhile, buyers of the 47 Signature and Penthouse units were also able to choose between an Aston Martin DBX sports SUV or the company\u2019s DB11 sportscar. Aston Martin isn\u2019t the first luxury carmaker to enter the residential property market. A 63-story building from Bentley will open in 2026 along the coastline of Sunny Isles Beach, Florida. Featuring 216 units, the property will have an elevator designed to take residents up to their doorstep while seated inside their cars.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/02/style/aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_10_europe_france-macron-gamble-far-right-vote-intl-cmd", "text": "It was a stinging blow and a shocking parry. French President Emmanuel Macron saw his party fall into second place in European Parliament elections in France on Sunday, with the two main far-right parties together taking close to 40% of the vote. When Jordan Bardella, the leader of the far-right National Rally party, called on Macron\ufeff to dissolve the French national parliament on Sunday night, it seemed like political posturing, riding high on his victory in European polls. \u201cThe President of the Republic cannot remain deaf to the message sent by the French this evening,\u201d he told supporters. Macron called his bluff. Announcing a snap national election for the end of June, Macron has set up a showdown between his pro-European, centrist and pro-Ukrainian ideals and the anti-immigration, populist and hard-line law-and-order rhetoric of the far right. \u201cThe extreme right is both the impoverishment of the French and the downgrading of our country. So, at the end of this day, I cannot act as if nothing had happened,\u201d he told the country in a televised address Sunday. Calling the far right\u2019s bluff Macron will try to rally the right and left, urging their supporters to come together and vote against the far right, but there\u2019s no knowing if it\u2019ll pay off. The first round of voting will take place in 20 days, a tiny window in which to form a coalition from the mosaic of France\u2019s centrist and left-wing parties. There appears to be little appetite to join forces with Macron on the left, bruised after years of largely fruitless protests against his pro-business agenda, and torn apart from the inside by divisions over the war in Gaza. The last time a French president dissolved the country\u2019s lower house, the National Assembly, was in 1997. Jacques Chirac lost his majority, and the left came to power. In an interview Monday morning, French Foreign Minister Stephane S\u00e9journ\u00e9 said that Macron\u2019s Renaissance party was open to withholding candidates from contesting the seats of potential allies in other parties. S\u00e9journ\u00e9 told Radio France that the party would discuss such a move with \u201creasonable people with whom we can work.\u201d On Sunday night, the popular French far-left party France Unbowed (LFI) appeared to have already ruled itself out of such a move. \u201cIt is now clear that the country wants to turn the page on the Macron era. And this page must not be turned with the National Rally and the far right,\u201d Manon Aubry, leader of the LFI European list, which came fourth in the European vote in France, told supporters. LFI figurehead Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon said that he saw no reason to unite with other parties on the left, especially with the narrow window to form a coalition. Such a proposition by Macron\u2019s party is no doubt a sign of weakness, a far cry from Macron\u2019s 2017 landslide second-round victory over far-right presidential candidate Marine Le Pen \u2013 and a sign of the times, his party wounded by memories of the \u201cyellow vest\u201d protests, an unyielding Covid-19 regime, and unpopular pension reforms. Since parliamentary elections held at the beginning of his second term in 2022, Macron has been ruling without an absolute majority in parliament, ordinarily unable to pass bills with his lawmakers alone. Instead, he invoked article 49.3 of the constitution several times to push legislation through parliament without a vote. This has stoked yet more anger against Macron and further division in France, especially given the contentious nature of his hike in the pension age to 64. Dueling visions The far-right National Rally, spearheaded by Le Pen, the long-time doyenne of France\u2019s anti-immigration camp, currently holds 88 to Macron\u2019s bloc\u2019s 250 seats in the 577-seat French parliament and, in theory, the upcoming election is far from a two-horse race. The appeal of the far-right\u2019s anti-immigration stance is no doubt magnified on the European stage \u2013 where EU lawmakers have long struggled to stem illegal immigration flows. At a national level, Bardella and Le Pen will have to rely on a broader spectrum of policies, doing battle with Macron\u2019s economic record, which has mostly shielded France from the inflation woes suffered by Europe. However, it\u2019s clear that this election will be a duel between Macron and Le Pen. French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire admitted Monday morning that his party held some responsibility for Sunday\u2019s results. He made his objective for the campaign clear. \u201cThis will be project against project; National Rally against ours,\u201d he told French radio network RTL. The French foreign minister described the call for elections as a \u201cbet of confidence\u201d in the French people by Macron, with the president trusting they will hold the line against political extremes. France\u2019s voting system plays in Macron\u2019s favor. In the first round of ballots, a variety of parties will compete to meet a minimum threshold of votes. The second round on July 7 will see the highest-polling candidates in each seat run off if no one wins an absolute majority. This could see voters of different stripes banding together to oppose a candidate from the far right. This mechanism also applies to the presidential election, which has ensured no far-right victory at the Elysee Palace thus far. On a more local scale, it may not be such a security. Ultimately, the June 30 and July 7 votes will determine how Macron spends his last three years in power. What comes next? What\u2019s certain is that Macron \u2013 with a presidential mandate until 2027 - will remain president no matter what. If his gamble pays off and he wins back a majority in parliament, he\u2019ll be able to move ahead with reforms and govern as he likes: changes to end-of-life care and the education system are in his crosshairs. It\u2019ll give him precious breathing space and a clear mandate for his agenda at home and abroad. In his words, \u201cIt\u2019s a time of indispensable clarification.\u201d \u201cThe rise of nationalists and demagogues is a danger not only for our nation, but also for our Europe and for France\u2019s place in Europe and the world,\u201d Macron said Sunday in his address to the nation. But the prospect of a lame-duck presidency looms large. If his bloc, currently with 250 of the 577 MPs in the National Assembly, fails to meet the 289-seat threshold for an absolute majority but remains the largest, his government will again have to wage legislative battle with one hand tied behind its back. If his nightmare comes true and the far-right movement replicates its European results on the national stage, he will be forced to appoint a prime minister from its ranks \u2013 most likely the 28-year-old Bardella, current president of National Rally. In a \u201ccohabitation,\u201d Macron would deal with international and defense issues, while Bardella would hold sway over the domestic agenda. Party figurehead Le Pen would likely wait in the wings to contest the 2027 president election against Macron\u2019s successor. The constitution prevents him running for a third term. \u201cWe are ready to be in power,\u201d she said in her Sunday night victory speech. In a country increasingly polarized by populist rhetoric, Ya\u00ebl Braun-Pivet, speaker of France\u2019s National Assembly struck a lonely note Monday morning as she called for greater cross-party cooperation. \u201cIn France we don\u2019t manage to get past partisan quarrels,\u201d she said in an interview with broadcaster France 2. Macron\u2019s reputation has been founded on bold, political moves. But if he fails to hold back the far-right this month in the coming weeks, his legacy will be the gamble that let the far right into power.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/europe/france-macron-gamble-far-right-vote-intl-cmd/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "world"}}

The aircraft went missing after it failed to land at the Mzuzu International Airport, about 380 km (240 miles) to the north of the capital Lilongwe. The wreckage of the plane has been located, Chakwera said in an address to the nation. \u201cThe search and rescue operation I ordered to find the missing plane that carried our vice president and nine others has been completed. The plane has been found. And I am deeply saddened and sorry to inform you that it has turned out to be a terrible tragedy,\u201d Chakwera\u00a0said. The Malawian leader disclosed that the aircraft was found \u201ccompletely destroyed\u201d near a hill in the Chikangawa\u00a0Forest in northern Malawi, adding that \u201cwords cannot describe how heartbreaking this is.\u201d Chakwera paid tribute to his deputy, describing him as \u201ca good man, a devoted father and husband, (and) a patriotic citizen who served his country with distinction.\u201d \u201cHis passing is a terrible loss to his wife, Mary, his family, his friends, his colleagues in the cabinet and to all of us as a nation,\u201d Chakwera said in his address from the Malawian capital. The president also mourned the loss of the other passengers onboard. The Malawian leader highlighted the tragic nature of the accident, telling journalists that he had himself previously traveled on the same aircraft. \u201cYet despite the track record of the aircraft and the experience of the crew, something terrible went wrong with that aircraft on its flight back to Lilongwe,\u201d he added. On Monday evening, the president had told journalists that air traffic control had advised the vice president\u2019s plane against trying to land, and recommended turning back to the capital due to poor visibility. Not long after, the authorities lost contact with the aircraft, and started a search operation. Earlier on Tuesday, the Malawi Defence Force said it had deployed drones and at least 200 soldiers to search for the plane at the Chikangawa\u00a0Forest reserve where signals of its whereabouts were last received. The Force Commander Paul Valentino Phiri said rescue operations had been delayed by bad weather conditions. The vice president and nine other victims will all be laid to rest in \u201ca dignified manner,\u201d Chakwera said. Their remains arrived in the capital Tuesday evening and were received by Chakwera, live visuals showed. The country will observe a 21-day national mourning for Chilima and the other officials killed in the crash. The mourning period will start on June 11 and last until July 1, according to a statement from the president\u2019s office. United Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said he was \u201cvery saddened\u201d to hear of the plane crash. \u201cWe offer condolences to their families and we stand with the people of Malawi at this sad time,\u201d he said. Chilima, 51, had arrived back in\u00a0Malawi\u00a0on June 6 after attending the Korea-Africa\u00a0Summit in Seoul last week. He first served as deputy to former President Peter Mutharika between 2014 and 2019 before being sworn in as vice president for a second time in 2020. An economist, Chilima previously headed Airtel Malawi, the first Malawian to lead the telecommunications company. \u201cI consider it one of the greatest honors of my life to have had him as my deputy and counsellor for the past four years,\u201d President Chakwera said.

{"id": "2024_06_12_middleeast_andrey-kozlov-family-israel-hamas-gaza-intl", "text": "The family of\u00a0one of the hostages rescued in an Israeli operation over the weekend has said that he experienced psychological abuse over the hands of his Hamas captors during the eight months that he was held in Gaza. Andrey\u00a0Kozlov, 27, was rescued alongside Noa Argamani, Almog Meir Jan and Shlomi Ziv during a raid on the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza on Saturday. The operation was only the third Israeli rescue of hostages held in Gaza and has been celebrated in Israel. But it left a trail of devastation, with authorities in Gaza saying at least 274 Palestinians were killed in the raid and the ensuing firefight with Hamas militants. Kozlov and the others were held in two civilian buildings in the densely packed territory. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has said that the raid was carried out in the two buildings simultaneously for fear the captors would kill some of the hostages if they knew an operation was unfolding. A Russian citizen, Kozlov moved to Israel almost two years ago. He was working as a security guard at the Nova music festival on October 7 when he was kidnapped and taken into Gaza. In an interview with CNN, Kozlov\u2019s family revealed\u00a0some details of their son\u2019s ordeal, including that he initially believed the Israeli forces who saved him had been sent to kill him. Kozlov\u2019s father, Mikhail Kozlov, said his son was \u201cvery scared\u201d because Hamas militants had\u00a0for months\u00a0falsely said that \u201cIsrael wanted to kill them all\u201d\u00a0claiming \u201cthey were a problem for Israel\u201d. \u201cHe was told that Israel wants to kill him. He didn\u2019t understand why the IDF\u00a0came. He was afraid that the IDF came to kill him. It took him some time to realize that they came to rescue him.\u201d Mikhail said his son would not reveal all the ways he\u2019d been mistreated,\u00a0saying\u00a0\u201che wasn\u2019t seen as a human by them.\u201d \u201cI would say that they would punish him for any behavior that they considered was wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the examples that Andrey gave us\u2026 is that at the hottest time of the day they would cover him with blankets,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a very difficult ordeal. To be dehydrated during heat.\u201d His\u00a0brother, Dmitry, said\u00a0\u201cthey were trying not to leave [physical] marks \u2026 But they would still punish him this way or the other. Very often for trivial things.\u201d \u201cHe was told not to speak in Hebrew, you need to whisper and [even that] in English.\u201d Describing their reunion, Mikhail said: \u201cThe first meeting was very touching\u2026 We expected to have a vibrant meeting and some joy, but instead, he knelt down and burst into tears and that was very moving for us.\u201d Dmitry said his brother feels indebted to Israel. \u201cHe says that he doesn\u2019t understand what he has done to deserve this generosity towards him, because he hasn\u2019t done anything. So he feels obliged to pass this goodness on to the next person and help get others [hostages] out.\u201d With the rescue of the four hostages, 116 remain in Gaza from the October 7 attacks, of which 41 are believed to be dead. Mikhail said that he was in favor of securing the release of the remaining hostages by any means \u2013 by negotiation, or further military action. \u201cIf it can be a deal, if a deal can help to release them, then be it,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it\u2019s possible to carry such an operation again, then it should be an operation for the release of these hostages. We need to use any means to return these people back to their families.\u201d \u2018A lot of abuse, almost every day\u2019 The doctor in charge of medical treatment for the four Israeli hostages rescued Saturday said they were beaten while in Hamas captivity in Gaza. \u201cIt was a harsh, harsh, experience, with a lot of abuse, almost every day,\u201d Dr. Itai Pessach told CNN. \u201cEvery hour, both physical, mental and other types, and that is something that is beyond comprehension.\u201d Pessach said the eight months spent in captivity \u201cleft a significant mark on their health\u201d and despite appearing in good condition initially, they are all malnourished.\u00a0 \u201cThey had no protein, so their muscles are extremely wasted, there is damage to some other systems because of that.\u201d He said the hostages told him they were moved several times, dealing with a number of different guards. The supply of food and water was unstable. \u201cThere have been periods where they got almost no food whatsoever, there were other periods where it was a little better, but all in all, the combination of the psychological stress, malnutrition or not getting enough food or not getting the right kind of food, medical neglect, being limited to space, not seeing the sun and all of the other things have significant effect on health.\u201d The testimony is the latest insight into conditions Hamas keeps hostages in. Other hostages\u00a0have previously outlined their ordeals. Keren Munder, her mother and her 9-year-old son \u2013 who were among scores of hostages released under a temporary truce last year - endured days with only pita bread to eat, according to her cousin Merav Mor Raviv. Munder and her mother both lost between six and eight kilograms in weight. Another hostage, 72-year-old Adina Moshe, endured \u201chorrible\u201d conditions while she was held captive, according to her nephew, who added that she didn\u2019t have access to basic facilities like a shower. Israel launched its war in Gaza following the Hamas attacks of October 7, when militants killed about 1,200 people and took more than 250 hostage. Since then, the Israeli campaign has killed more than 37,000 people, according to the ministry of health in Gaza, and triggered a humanitarian crisis. Concerns over food insecurity and famine are growing, with a UN report warning recently that more than one million people, half of Gaza\u2019s population, are \u201cexpected to face death and starvation\u201d by mid-July.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/middleeast/andrey-kozlov-family-israel-hamas-gaza-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_07_uk_rishi-sunak-d-day-event-uk-election-gbr-intl", "text": "Britain\u2019s Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has apologized for leaving the 80th anniversary commemorations of D-Day early in order to film a TV interview, a decision that prompted incredulity and further derailed his floundering general election campaign. Sunak attended the first part of the commemorative events in Normandy, France, on Thursday, but skipped the international ceremony at Omaha Beach, which was attended by other world leaders and veterans of the Allied operation in 1944. \u201cThe last thing I want is for the commemorations to be overshadowed by politics,\u201d Sunak wrote in a long apology on X. \u201cAfter the conclusion of the British event in Normandy, I returned back to the UK. On reflection, it was a mistake not to stay in France longer \u2013 and I apologise.\u201d But the move had already caused anger and disbelief in Britain, and represented another major miscalculation in Sunak\u2019s faltering election campaign. Sunak left the event to record a campaign interview with broadcaster ITV, the network confirmed, in which he defended claims about the opposition Labour Party\u2019s tax plans which fact-checkers and a senior civil servant have said were misleading or inaccurate. More than 20 heads of state and government, and representatives from royal families across Europe, attended the international ceremony, which took place on a day of commemoration 80 years after the Allied beach landings in Nazi-occupied France laid the groundwork for the defeat of Germany in World War II. \u201cLook, I get the outrage. I get that this is a significant mistake,\u201d Sunak\u2019s own veterans minister, Johnny Mercer, told UK newspaper The Sun on Friday, while also attacking what he labelled as \u201cfaux outrage\u201d from Sunak\u2019s critics. The UK was represented at the international ceremony by David Cameron, Sunak\u2019s foreign secretary and a former prime minister, who took photographs alongside French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and US President Joe Biden. Also in attendance was Labour leader Keir Starmer, who was filmed speaking with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during the event. Labour was quick to condemn Sunak\u2019s decision to skip the events, and the gaffe dominated British news coverage of the election on Friday. Speaking to reporters on Friday,\u00a0Sunak\u00a0said that his leaving early was a \u201cmistake,\u201d but added\u00a0that \u201cit\u2019s important though, given the enormity of the sacrifice made, that we don\u2019t politicize this.\u201d \u201cThe focus should rightly be on the veterans who gave so much,\u201d he said, before stating that he \u201cwill always be proud of our record in supporting veterans here in the UK.\u201d Sunak\u2019s campaign began with a rain-soaked speech outside Downing Street and has been beset by questionable decision-making and optically damaging events, all while failing to shift a cavernous poll deficit \u2013 but Thursday\u2019s D-Day error felt like the most perplexing and detrimental moment of the campaign so far. He was already batting back accusations from Labour that he lied about the cost of the opposition party\u2019s tax plans \u2013 a topic in the debate he filmed with ITV on Thursday night. The UK Treasury flatly contradicted Sunak\u2019s claim in a TV debate Tuesday that its impartial officials had calculated Labour plans would \u201cput up everyone\u2019s taxes by \u00a32,000.\u201d Labour\u2019s policy manifesto has not yet been published, and the party says its agenda is fully costed. ITV News said its team had not specifically requested to speak to the prime minister on Thursday, and that the date was in fact put forward by Sunak\u2019s team, despite it falling on the anniversary of D-Day. \u201cToday was the slot that we were offered, we don\u2019t know why. Obviously it\u2019s not our choice, but he certainly returned from Normandy ready to dive back into the campaign,\u201d ITV\u2019s UK Editor Paul Brand, who carried out the interview, stated in an ITV\u00a0report on Thursday night. \u201cYesterday\u2019s D-Day commemorations were about remembering the bravery of all those who serve our country,\u201d Jonathan Ashworth, Labour\u2019s Shadow Paymaster General, said Friday\ufeff. \u201cIn choosing to prioritise his own vanity TV appearances over our veterans, Rishi Sunak has shown what is most important to him.\u201d Sunak is projected to lose the election on July 4 to Labour by a hefty margin, and his campaign has failed to land a decisive moment that could swing opinion polls in his favor. In recent days his efforts were dealt a further blow when Nigel Farage, an architect of Brexit and a populist thorn in the side of numerous Conservative leaders, announced he would lead the Reform Party\u2019s campaign, directly appealing to right-leaning Tory backers to abandon Sunak and vote for his insurgent group. Farage also leapt on Sunak\u2019s lapse in judgment, writing on X that the Prime Minister \u201ccould not even be bothered to attend the international event above Omaha Beach.\u201d In another post, he added: \u201cPatriotic people who love their country should not vote for him.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/uk/rishi-sunak-d-day-event-uk-election-gbr-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "world"}}

In a news briefing Tuesday, the South Korean military\u00a0appeared to downplay the significance of the gunfire, saying the North Korean soldiers quickly retreated and\u00a0did not appear to have the intention of invading the southern side, based on information that cannot be made public. \u201cThere were no unusual movements other than the North Korean army immediately moving north after our warning shots,\u201d said Col.

Kim Yo Jong, the powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, late Sunday warned the resumption of loudspeaker broadcasts was \u201ca prelude to a very dangerous situation\u201d and that South Korea would be subject to an unspecified \u201cnew counteraction\u201d from the North if it continued with the action.

The incident Sunday marked the first instance of gunfire within the DMZ since 2020, when there was an accidental exchange of shots between the two Koreas, said Lee, the Joint Chiefs spokesperson. Lee said the North Korean troops headed back across the Military Demarcation Line (MDL) that runs down the center of the DMZ after the warnings. The shots did not cross over the MDL to the North Korean side of the DMZ, he added. Lee noted that the DMZ area has overgrown forests, and MDL markers are not visible without distinctive paths.

{"id": "2024_06_11_middleeast_israel-gaza-un-security-council-ceasefire-intl-hnk", "text": "Israel has vowed to persist with its military operation in Gaza, saying it won\u2019t engage in \u201cmeaningless\u201d negotiations with Hamas, shortly after the United Nations Security Council overwhelmingly approved a US-backed ceasefire plan intended to bring an end to the eight-month war. Israel\u2019s representative to the UN, Reut Shapir Ben-Naftaly, emphasized at a UNSC meeting Monday that her country wants to \u201censure that Gaza doesn\u2019t pose a threat to Israel in the future.\u201d The senior diplomat said the war would not end until all hostages were returned and Hamas\u2019 capabilities were \u201cdismantled,\u201d accusing the Palestinian militant group of using \u201cendless negotiations\u2026 as a means to stall for time.\u201d Her comments came after 14 of the 15 UNSC council members voted in favor of Monday\u2019s US-drafted resolution, with only Russia abstaining \u2013 the first time the council has endorsed such a plan to end the war. Israel is not a member of the\u00a0UNSC, and so did not vote. The comprehensive three-stage peace deal, which sets out conditions intended to lead to the eventual release of all remaining hostages, in return for a permanent ceasefire and withdrawal of Israeli forces, was first laid out by US President Joe Biden on May 31. The landmark vote means the UNSC now joins other major global bodies in backing the plan, increasing international pressure on both Hamas and Israel to end the conflict. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who is on a diplomatic trip to the Middle East, said Tuesday that in a meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu the Israeli leader \u201creaffirmed his commitment\u201d to the current proposal to secure a ceasefire and hostage release, which is still awaiting an answer from Hamas. Blinken said that he got an explicit assurance from Netanyahu that he continues to support the deal, and will accept it if Hamas agrees to what is on the table. Netanyahu has repeatedly and publicly said that his country will press on with the war in Gaza until Hamas is destroyed and the hostages are freed. But an Israeli statement on Tuesday indicated it was poised to formally sign up to the current ceasefire plan for Gaza, while at the same time maintaining the freedom to keep fighting. The short communication issued Tuesday, attributed only to an Israeli government official, though widely understood to mean the Prime Minister\u2019s Office, started with an assertion of Israel\u2019s war aims before expressing support for the US-backed proposal currently on the table. \u201cIsrael will not end the war before achieving all its war objectives: destroying Hamas\u2019s military and governing capabilities, freeing all the hostages and ensuring Gaza doesn\u2019t pose a threat to Israel in the future,\u201d it said. \u201cThe proposal presented enables Israel to achieve these goals and Israel will indeed do so,\u201d the statement concluded. Israel and Hamas react Hamas welcomed the adoption of the UNSC resolution, saying in a statement it was ready to engage with mediators to implement measures such as the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, prisoner exchange, returning residents to their homes and the \u201crejection of any demographic change or reduction in the area of the Gaza Strip.\u201d The resolution says Israel has accepted the plan, and US officials have repeatedly emphasized Israel had agreed to the proposal \u2013 despite other public comments from Netanyahu that suggest otherwise. Even last month, less than an hour after Biden unveiled his proposal, Netanyahu insisted Israel would not end the war until Hamas is defeated. The\u00a0United States\u00a0ambassador to the\u00a0UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said Monday the US would guarantee Israel follows through with its obligations, while Egypt and Qatar would do the same with Hamas. \u201cThe fighting could stop today,\u201d if Hamas agreed to the deal, she said. But detailed negotiations to implement its provisions are yet to yield agreement from both Israel and Hamas. The deal is divided into three phases, according to Thomas-Greenfield. It includes an initial ceasefire, the release of Israeli hostages and the exchange of Palestinian prisoners, and ultimately a permanent end to hostilities and full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, as well as the effective distribution of aid and a major multiyear reconstruction in the strip. The ambassador also said the deal \u201crejects any geographical changes\u201d in Gaza and reiterates the commitment for a two-state solution. The Palestinian UN envoy Riyad\u00a0Mansour said the Palestinian Authority \u2013 which governs\u00a0the Israeli-occupied West Bank \u2013 welcomed the deal as a \u201cstep in the right direction,\u201d but said it was up to Israel to implement those measures. \u201cWe want a ceasefire,\u201d he said, adding the \u201cburden is on the Israeli side to implement this resolution.\u201d \u201cThe proof is in the pudding. We will see who are the ones who are interested to see this resolution to become a reality and those who are obstructing it and want to continue the war of genocide against our people,\u201d he added. US pushes for Israeli support on deal Ahead of the vote, Blinken told Netanyahu during their meeting in Jerusalem that the proposal would \u201cunlock the possibility of calm along\u00a0Israel\u2019s northern border and further integration with countries in the region,\u201d according to a State Department readout. \u201cThe United States and other world leaders will stand behind\u201d the proposal for a release of the hostages and an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, Blinken told Netanyahu. After the resolution was adopted, Blinken spoke with Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, where he \u201ccommended\u00a0Israel\u2019s readiness to conclude a deal and affirmed that the onus is on Hamas to accept,\u201d according to a readout of their meeting. Blinken arrived in Israel on Monday, following the resignation of Benny Gantz from the Israeli war cabinet on Sunday. Gantz\u2019s departure delivered a blow to Netanyahu, who is coming under increasing pressure from Western allies and families of hostages to end the war and bring back the captives. Gantz stressed to Blinken\u00a0in their meeting the importance of \u201capplying maximum pressure\u201d on negotiators to secure Hamas\u2019 agreement to the latest ceasefire plan and bring those being held in Gaza home, according to a statement from Gantz\u2019s office. It added that Gantz said his party would support \u201cany responsible arrangement\u201d on the matter from outside the government. There has been confusion about whose proposal this is, however. Biden has called it an \u201cIsraeli proposal,\u201d but less than an hour after Biden announced the plan in May,\u00a0Netanyahu\u00a0said his country would not end the war until Hamas is defeated. Biden has said Hamas has been degraded to a point where it can no longer carry out the type of attack, and that now \u201cit\u2019s time for this war to end.\u201d The Israeli prime minister, however, is yet to publicly announce whether his country has accepted or rejected the US-drafted proposal. Eight months since the war began, Israel is yet to achieve its stated objectives as most of Hamas\u2019 top leadership remains at large, while earlier this week, Israeli military officials estimated around 120 hostages remain captive, of which around 70 are thought to still be alive. More than 37,000 people have been killed in Gaza since the war began, according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza. CNN cannot verify the\u00a0numbers provided by the ministry, which does not distinguish between casualties among fighters and civilians. It does not include in its figures the several thousand people thought to be missing, or those still under the rubble in\u00a0Gaza\u00a0since October 7.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/middleeast/israel-gaza-un-security-council-ceasefire-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "travel_flight-attendants-surviving-long-haul-plane-flights", "text": "Any air travel can be stressful, but facing down a long-haul flight can be especially intimidating. Should you prioritize sleeping or eating, or both? Should you attempt to exercise in the aisle? Is it ever acceptable to take off your shoes? Kris Major is a British flight attendant with 25 years\u2019 experience. He\u2019s worked short-haul hops and spent 14-hour stretches in the sky. He\u2019s endured journeys with an unenviable number of layovers, and he\u2019s become an expert in refueling via power naps at 30,000 feet. As many of us prepare for long-haul trips over the summer, Major tells CNN Travel his tips and tricks on surviving multiple hours in the sky. Should you eat before or during an overnight flight? If you\u2019re catching a night flight and you want to maximize sleep on board, Major suggests eating before boarding. This is particularly important if the flight is on the shorter end of the long-haul scale: if you\u2019re traveling from New York to London, for example, at best you\u2019re looking at around five or six hours sleep, so you want to make the most of that rest time. Major, who also represents European flight attendants and pilots as chair of the European Transport Workers\u2019 Federation\u2019s Joint Aircrew Committee, says it\u2019s telling that most business travelers shut their eyes as soon as they get on board. \u201cThe seasoned travelers, after takeoff, you go down the cabin and you can see that they\u2019re gone \u2013 they\u2019ve covered themselves up and they\u2019re asleep,\u201d he says. Still, Major admits that eating before flying isn\u2019t always doable, because of long security lines and busy airport terminals. Even if you have the best intentions, you can end up settling for a sad-looking sandwich as you run to the gate. If you\u2019re flying business or first class, you also might be tempted to make the most of food and drink offered on board \u2013 it\u2019s hard to turn down complimentary champagne, after all. But realistically, the cabin food and drink service can take a good two hours, so you\u2019re losing valuable rest time \u2013 and your Business Class ticket should give you access to an airport lounge, so max out those facilities instead, and board the plane well-fueled and ready to rest. So when should you eat on the plane? If you\u2019re flying long-haul, you\u2019ll likely be offered more than one meal during the course of the flight. Meal times start to feel a bit arbitrary when you\u2019re crossing multiple time zones, but should you eat whenever food is offered to you? Or should you turn meals down if you\u2019re not hungry or trying to sleep? Major says passengers should do whatever\u2019s right for their travel schedule. If you\u2019re exhausted, you\u2019re better off sleeping than forcing yourself to eat dinner at the equivalent of 3 a.m. \u201cMost airlines don\u2019t particularly plan their [food] service around the passenger and acclimatization and time zones crossing,\u201d explains Major. Should you bring a travel pillow or rely on the airline offerings? Airlines usually provide pillows for long-haul travelers, no matter the cabin, but Major says bringing your own eye mask, travel pillow and/or a blanket could be a good idea depending on your preferences. Eye masks are great if you\u2019re trying to sleep when the cabin lights are on, while you might prefer your own travel pillow to the airline version. Plus, while it\u2019s rare, there\u2019s always the chance that pillows are unavailable \u2013 something that could be a big problem on a 14-hour flight. \u201cIt happens,\u201d says Major. \u201cSo I would say, cater yourself for your own comfort and your own needs as much as you possibly can.\u201d What if you can\u2019t sleep? Many of us find it difficult to sleep on airplanes, whether due to unfamiliar noises or, for the cheaper seats, limited leg room and upright positions. Struggling to sleep on a long flight, knowing you\u2019re going to pay for the lost hours when you land, can be an unpleasant cycle of worry. Should you persevere and keep trying, or give up and watch a movie? Major says there\u2019s no point trying to force sleep, particularly if your body clock thinks it\u2019s the middle of the day and you\u2019re simply not tired. But he cautions that it\u2019s important to bear in mind what you\u2019re doing at the other end. If you\u2019re going to be driving, for example, or going straight to a meeting, you should try and rest as much as you can. What are the flight attendant rest areas like? Crew rest areas exist on all airplanes, but what these rest areas look like depends on the airline, aircraft and the length of the flight. \u201cIf we\u2019re going somewhere over, say, 13 hours, we need to have good rest areas,\u201d says Major, who explains flight attendants should typically be entitled to breaks that allow for 90 minutes of sleep. That way, they\u2019ve completed a full sleep cycle before they\u2019re back to work. \u201cYou need at least one sleep cycle scientifically to be of any use, to keep your ability to operate safely, your decision making processes, your communication skills,\u201d says Major. Flight attendants need to be alert throughout the journey, so they will take it in turns to refuel via mid-flight power naps. Major says he finds sleeping in crew rest areas pretty easy, but he knows flight attendants who find it tough to sleep in beds that Major calls \u201ctechnically coffins.\u201d \u201cThere are some crew that really struggle with the bunks, they\u2019re not pleasant,\u201d says Major. \u201cYou push yourself right in, so they\u2019re long and thin, because they\u2019re up in the aircraft, so there\u2019s not a lot of space. They are like what you\u2019d imagine you\u2019d see on a submarine.\u201d Flight attendants will usually opt to get changed out of their uniform and into loungewear before squeezing into the bunks. Major says he always packs a T-shirt and some comfortable lounge pants. As he\u2019s a senior flight attendant, Major will hang his tie on the exterior of his bunk\u2019s curtain before he closes his eyes. \u201cSo that if there\u2019s any emergency whilst I\u2019m in the bunk, they know exactly which one I\u2019m in, even though there\u2019s usually one designated for the senior,\u201d Major explains. Do you have any tips on feeling fresh after sleeping on a plane? We\u2019ve all experienced waking up after a mid-flight sleep, groggily heading to the airplane bathroom to freshen up, and alarming yourself when you catch sight of your exhausted reflection. Major\u2019s top tip for feeling refreshed following inflight rest might sound obvious, but he insists it makes a world of difference. \u201cCleaning your teeth is always the one that freshens everybody up the most,\u201d he says, adding that flight attendants will always have between five and 10 minutes to freshen up before they\u2019re back on duty. That\u2019s enough time to get dressed, wash and, if you need to, comb hair and refresh makeup. Flight attendants will greet a returning colleague with a cup of tea or coffee. Then they\u2019ll head off duty for their own rest period. Should you exercise on a long-haul flight? Sitting in the same upright position for hours on end is uncomfortable, but it\u2019s not always easy to get up to stretch. The seat belt sign might be switched on, or you might want to avoid disturbing your seat neighbor. Major stresses that even just wiggling your toes while sitting in your seat is worthwhile. \u201cDo move around in your seat, move your legs, do what comes naturally \u2013 wiggle, move, get the blood flowing if that\u2019s what you need to do. For people that have got circulatory issues, talk to your doctor,\u201d he says. What\u2019s your perspective on passengers taking off their shoes? For many passengers, this is a controversial question due to concerns about smelly feet. But Major encourages anyone on a long-haul flight to remove shoes for comfort, and to help their circulation. Flight attendants don\u2019t care, he says. \u201cWe do it ourselves. I think most people do it themselves. It\u2019s the right thing to do if you\u2019re going on a long-haul flight,\u201d he says. \u201cOne would hope that you\u2019ve had the common decency to have a bath or a shower and put clean socks or stockings or tights on before you get on the aircraft. That\u2019s the only issue, if your feet smell.\u201d Major adds that it\u2019s polite, if you think there\u2019s a chance of feet odor, to \u201cgo to the washroom and do something about it.\u201d But flight attendants, he says, are more worried about passengers sticking out their feet into the aisle. \u201cOn a night flight particularly, if you put your feet in the aisle and you\u2019ve got dark socks on, we won\u2019t see you, and we\u2019ll trip over you, and it\u2019s a bit of a nuisance for us.\u201d What\u2019s the best seat to book for a long flight? If you\u2019re worried about turbulence, Major advises that you try to sit near the front of the aircraft. \u201cYou could be standing at the front and feel nothing, and down the back they\u2019re bouncing all over the place \u2013 the aircraft moves differently down the back,\u201d he explains. If you\u2019re tall, booking the emergency exit seat for the extra leg room could be worthwhile, although Major says it\u2019s worth remembering \u201cyou can\u2019t put your bags down at your feet or anything because it needs to be clear as an evacuation run.\u201d Airlines also sometimes charge extra for seats with leg room. Major\u2019s personal choice on a long-haul flight is booking a window seat. \u201cThat\u2019s purely preferential, I can lean up against the bulkhead, pull my head down and go to sleep. Whereas you can\u2019t when you\u2019re in the aisle seats or the middle seat,\u201d he says. The middle seat is never enviable, but it\u2019s perhaps particularly unappealing on a long flight. Major reckons it\u2019s worth paying extra for the aisle or window, especially \u201cif you need to sleep on the flight.\u201d Should I invest in noise-canceling headphones and bring my iPad on board? The way we consume TV and movies has changed drastically over the past decade, but inflight entertainment has largely stayed unchanged. While many of us still enjoy watching new movie releases on board flights, it\u2019s less of a novelty than it once was. Many passengers prefer binging a pre-downloaded streaming show on a personal device. \u201cMost people self-cater flights now when it comes to entertainment,\u201d says Major. Your own devices are also a good back-up in case there are issues with the in-flight entertainment system, which Major admits \u201cmight not always be working.\u201d Flight attendants usually have handbooks that advise how to operate the inflight screens, but they\u2019re not always able to fix the problem. \u201cThere\u2019s only so much we can do on the aircraft to kick it back to life if it starts to play up,\u201d says Major. \u201cThere\u2019s very little we can do, apart from the usual scientific \u2018turn it off, turn it on again.\u2019\u201d Most aircraft today have USB charging sockets, but a portable charger could also give you added piece of mind. As a flight attendant, do you judge passengers\u2019 movie choices? Major says in his experience, crew aren\u2019t paying too much attention to what you\u2019ve opted to watch on board, but occasionally he\u2019ll comment on a traveler\u2019s choice. \u201cWe can use it as an ice breaker,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I\u2019ve seen a movie and it\u2019s good, it\u2019s something to use to strike up conversation.\u201d Major does recall once noticing a Business Class passenger reading a book which included some graphic descriptions. \u201cThe words were pretty pornographic although I couldn\u2019t see enough to follow the thread,\u201d Major says. The man was reading the book quite openly, and made no attempts to hide the contents. \u201cI was quite shocked,\u201d says Major. \u201cTurned out we were taking a group of sex therapists to a conference.\u201d Should you bring your own food and snacks? Absolutely, says Major. \u201cOn most flights, people forget that you get on the plane, you\u2019re not going to eat for the first hour, at least \u2013 it\u2019s probably going to be an hour and a half after takeoff before you eat,\u201d he says. If you have a health condition like diabetes, bringing your own sustenance is particularly key. It\u2019s also important to pack snacks if you\u2019re traveling with kids. I\u2019m taking my kids on a long-haul flight, what should I do? Major has young kids of his own, so he says he can answer this question both as a father and as a flight attendant. \u201cIf you\u2019re tense, your child will be tense, it\u2019s as simple as that. If you\u2019re stressed, and you\u2019re feeling anxious, your child will be anxious,\u201d he says. Flight attendants are experienced at talking kids and parents through the flying process, Major adds. \u201cBecause we\u2019re just generally very relaxed, we can calm them down very quickly,\u201d he says. When babies are crying, parents are panicking and other passengers are sighing, Major says he\u2019ll always handle the situation in the same way. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure it\u2019s audible for everyone else to hear, I\u2019ll say: \u2018Please don\u2019t worry about it. Don\u2019t worry about your child crying. It\u2019s helping your child rebalance their ears. It\u2019s the only way they can do it, through screaming. We\u2019ve all been children, we\u2019ve all cried, don\u2019t worry about it.\u2019 I\u2019ll try to put the parents at ease. By putting the parent at ease, we can hopefully settle the child.\u201d Major says bringing favorite toys and blankets on the aircraft can also help calm a child, as it helps the alien airplane environment seem more familiar and comforting. How do you deal with nervous passengers on long-haul flights? Those with a fear of flying are, in Major\u2019s experience, worried about one of two things. Either it\u2019s the \u201clack of control\u201d and the \u201calien environment.\u201d Or it\u2019s fear of the airplane crashing. Some people are reassured by Major walking them through the mechanics of the aircraft \u2013 explaining that unknown engine noises are normal, or that air travel is generally very safe and there are many fail-safes in place. Others would rather not know the ins and outs, they just need distracting. Major once spent two hours on board a flight chatting with a nervous passenger in the galley, taking their mind off the situation. Even for those who aren\u2019t generally afraid of flying, long-haul journeys present their own set of pressure points that can drive people into panic mode. Crying babies might be viewed as more of an annoyance on a short flight, but passengers can \u201cfreak,\u201d as Major puts it, if they think that\u2019s set to be their soundtrack for the next 12 hours. Delays to any flights are frustrating, but on longer flights, delays can suddenly hammer home \u201cthe reality of distance and time,\u201d says Major. But Major says it\u2019s important to remember that \u201cthere\u2019s always taxiing time built into the flight time.\u201d \u201cYou can make up time on long-haul a lot easier than short-haul,\u201d he adds. \u201cYou can pick up a good half hour.\u201d What\u2019s your opinion on AirTags? Major\u2019s never used an AirTag, but he understands the attraction \u2013 especially for passengers who\u2019ve dealt with a lost bag in the past. Although it\u2019s a different story when he travels with his family, Major says he usually travels carry-on only, even on long-haul flights. That\u2019s less because he\u2019s worried about losing luggage, and more for ease and speed. \u201cOn my own, I\u2019ve got one bag that I can live for a week out of, it\u2019s so finely tuned,\u201d he says. \u201cI fly with hand luggage only so I can get through the airport as quickly as possible.\u201d If you\u2019ve got a layover, how should you maximize that time? If you\u2019ve got several hours before the next leg of your journey, it could be worth booking a hotel room to catch up on sleep, says Major, who also advises stretching your legs and walking around as much as possible. If there\u2019s enough time to leave the airport and get some fresh air, that\u2019s worth doing too. Major knows what he\u2019s talking about, he once did a mammoth journey with multiple airport layovers, \u201cfrom Cairns - Brisbane, Brisbane - Sydney, Sydney - Abu Dhabi, Abu Dhabi - Vienna, Vienna - Frankfurt, Frankfurt - [London] Gatwick.\u201d \u201cWhen I got off, I was nearly dead,\u201d he jokes. What\u2019s your perspective on the super long-haul flights that could be a thing of the future? The longest flight Major\u2019s ever worked was around 14 hours. The longest scheduled flight currently in operation is Singapore Airlines\u2019 New York to Singapore flight, which lasts 18 hours and 40 minutes. Australian airline Qantas is preparing to launch its ultra long-haul \u201cProject Sunrise\u201d flights, which would span upwards of 19 hours flying passengers from New York and London to Sydney, Australia. For flight attendants, Major says, that will involve working over periods in excess of 24 hours. \u201cYou\u2019re missing two nights of sleep,\u201d says Major. \u201cThe impact of that we don\u2019t fully understand.\u201d It\u2019s still early days, says Major, and these details need to be ironed out. But he sees ultra long-haul as the \u201cevolution of flying.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got the aircraft to do it now, so we need to find ways of doing it,\u201d says Major. \u201cAnd we will. There\u2019s a lot of work going on to do that.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/flight-attendants-surviving-long-haul-plane-flights/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_06_11_middleeast_analysis-yahya-sinwar-hamas-ceasefire-talks-intl-latam", "text": "Yahya Sinwar has so far survived eight months of Israeli\u2019s brutal military campaign to kill him.\u00a0His longevity\u00a0is a personal victory for the Hamas leader \u2013 and increasingly appears to be grim vindication of his decision to seize the initiative in the generational Palestinian struggle with Israel\u00a0by\u00a0launching a bloody attack\u00a0on October 7 that would plunge Gaza\u2019s two million residents into a predictable hell. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and his military responded\u00a0as expected\u00a0to Sinwar\u2019s\u00a0onslaught\u00a0of terror\u00a0that killed more than 1,200\u00a0people and saw over 220 taken hostage, declaring war and vowing to destroy Hamas. Predictably too, according to many regional diplomats,\u00a0Israel\u2019s military campaign is\u00a0failing to deliver\u00a0on the dismantling of Hamas, even as the number of Palestinians killed soars past 36,000. While Hamas is people and structures, they argue, it is also an ideology. Now\u00a0Sinwar\u00a0\u2013 who speaks fluent Hebrew and has a nuanced knowledge of Israeli politics \u2013 believes he still has the war\u2019s initiative,\u00a0amid high-stakes bargaining with Israel for a ceasefire and hostage deal. \u201cWe have the Israelis right where we want them,\u201d\u00a0he is said to have told other Hamas leaders, in leaked messages reported by The Wall Street Journal. He appeared to justify the deaths of Palestinian civilians as a \u201cnecessary sacrifice\u201d according to the messages. If this were a conventional war, it would be easy to write Sinwar off as deluded; Israel has the upper hand by far in conventional weapons. But\u00a0the weapons\u2019\u00a0devastating effectiveness is becoming\u00a0a liability\u00a0in this asymmetric conflict, and against the backdrop of a\u00a0tortured history\u00a0that\u00a0Sinwar\u00a0is\u00a0adroitly weaponizing against Israel. Because of the enormous civilian casualties and suffering inflicted by Israel in its pursuit of Hamas, Netanyahu now faces a possible arrest warrant for war crimes from the ICC, the world\u2019s top court\u00a0\u2013 just like\u00a0Sinwar.\u00a0And\u00a0the consequences for Netanyahu are far more serious than for Hamas\u2019 leader, because Sinwar is already a renowned terrorist hiding in a tunnel with limited prospects and Netanyahu is a global leader whose world will dramatically shrink if the ICC issues warrants. Netanyahu dismisses the ICC as anti-Semitic, but\u00a0that hasn\u2019t neutralized the damage in the court of international opinion.\u00a0Meanwhile,\u00a0Sinwar\u00a0can sit back and cash in\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0international\u00a0anger\u00a0over\u00a0Palestinian suffering. Wind in Sinwar\u2019s sails Earlier this year,\u00a0university campuses\u00a0across the United States and Europe\u00a0combusted in spontaneous protest over\u00a0the toll of Israel\u2019s war on\u00a0civilians\u00a0in Gaza,\u00a0where humanitarians warn of a growing hunger crisis. For the first time, a generation of Palestinian were able to witness what they\u2019d always hoped for, a potent political\u00a0force\u00a0able to rival what they\u2019ve always perceived as an over loud, over pervasive and over powerful lobby\u00a0for Israeli interests. In any other year this may have been irrelevant, but Biden\u2019s back is to the wall in the upcoming US presidential election. He\u00a0has pledged unwavering support to Israel and continues to send weapons to Israel\u2019s military, but if he stays the course, Biden\u00a0risks losing vital votes in swing states from a new generation of left-leaning Democrats. He can\u2019t ignore the protesters\u2019 anger about Gaza\u2019s plight. This puts\u00a0wind in Sinwar\u2019s political sails. His negotiating team\u00a0has\u00a0gotten\u00a0tougher:\u00a0first\u00a0appearing\u00a0to be on\u00a0the verge of compromise, then holding out for a permanent ceasefire and complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. He also appears to have brought the reality of a Palestinian state closer too \u2013 a\u00a0political\u00a0coup following decades of stultifying inertia. US regional allies, notably Saudi Arabia, have set an \u201cirreversible\u201d path to a two-state solution as part of their price for buy-in to help Gaza rebuild. And while Netanyahu\u2019s far-right ministers predictably say no\u00a0to Palestinian statehood, some\u00a0Western\u00a0partners are\u00a0showing\u00a0they\u2019re fed up\u00a0with Israeli intransigence. In recent weeks, Ireland, Spain, Norway and Portugal, all frustrated Netanyahu won\u2019t agree a peace deal, have\u00a0formally\u00a0recognized Palestinian\u00a0statehood.\u00a0The statements\u00a0mark a remarkable departure\u00a0from\u00a0their previously cautious approach to Netanyahu\u2019s belligerence. Israel\u00a0has lashed out\u00a0against the four\u00a0European nations, but this doesn\u2019t sting Sinwar. He is able to hunker down deep below Gaza and relish the hell he has unleashed above and the repercussions he gambled on. Hamas\u2019s ideology thrives under the\u00a0current\u00a0Israeli attacks, precisely because it was born of, and nurtured on, that very\u00a0narrative.\u00a0The war\u00a0Sinwar\u00a0started\u00a0has taken\u00a0Palestinian\u00a0suffering to the next level\u00a0\u2013 and Netanyahu has played right into it. None of this means Sinwar will be winning a popular vote in Gaza during his lifetime, however long or short that may be. But the\u00a0enormous\u00a0bloodshed he precipitated has allowed him to tap into global moral outrage. He is\u00a0now\u00a0playing the Democratic world against itself,\u00a0and\u00a0his tools are the very\u00a0values\u00a0that\u00a0developed nations hold sacrosanct: sanctity of life and fair play. From a position of apparent weakness, he tries to turn every apparent disadvantage to advantage. On the cusp of Israel\u2019s imminent Rafah operation, he tried to stall it by claiming to accept an Egyptian peace deal\u00a0that\u00a0he said Israel had accepted \u2013 with his officials briefing details of the mechanics and timings of how hostage releases would work. As expected,\u00a0the tactic\u00a0spun up already febrile Israeli street protest against Netanyahu to a new level. Demonstrators demanded Netanyahu forestall the Rafah operation in favor of a seemingly tantalizingly close hostage release deal. Who\u2019s calling the shots in Gaza According to regional diplomats,\u00a0many\u00a0of Sinwar\u2019s power plays were entirely predictable. Decades of Israeli failure to address Palestinians\u2019 security and economic concerns outside of Israel\u2019s perceived interests set the table for Sinwar\u2019s challenge, and what he could expect to achieve. Sinwar\u2019s\u00a0power\u00a0amid the war\u00a0seems to be becoming part of the perceived wisdom about Gaza and the war. In Israel on Tuesday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said, \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone other than the Hamas leadership in Gaza actually are the ones who can make decisions.\u201d Even if Sinwar were\u00a0inclined\u00a0to solicit input from Hamas\u2019s well-heeled leadership cadre sitting in the comfort of Doha,\u00a0and\u00a0meeting leaders in Iran and Turkey, the likelihood they can bridge the gaps in their thinking\u00a0through\u00a0detailed discussion is almost nil.\u00a0Unfettered communication away from Israel\u2019s prying ears and eyes\u00a0is\u00a0impossible. In the final days before Northern Ireland\u2019s momentous 1998 Good Friday Peace Agreement between the IRA\u2019s political wing Sinn\u00a0Fein and the British government, I watched the group\u2019s top leaders emerge from the talks locked in intense, semi-silent conspiratorial whispers, slowly pacing adjacent gardens. But such conversations are likely a luxury Sinwar neither has, nor dares risk taking,\u00a0from wherever he is hiding in Gaza. And\u00a0like any leader convinced he is proving his point, he is unlikely to back down now\u00a0unless his key demands are locked in. His recent warning\u00a0that\u00a0Israel will have to fight for Rafah strongly suggest he is still in the process of bargaining. Blinken didn\u2019t mention Sinwar by name in his remarks Tuesday, but there was no need. Everyone in the room understood who he meant when he added, \u201cThat is what we are waiting on.\u201d And if messages of pressure to make a deal are reaching Sinwar he will also understand them for\u00a0another part of what they are \u2013 an\u00a0attempt\u00a0to turn Gazans\u00a0desperate for an end to the conflict\u00a0against him. As much as Sinwar has put the psychological screws on Israel\u2019s\u00a0leadership, he can be made vulnerable too.\u00a0And if\u00a0past experience is any measure, he will likely gamble\u00a0that\u00a0he can play mind games better than Netanyahu.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/middleeast/analysis-yahya-sinwar-hamas-ceasefire-talks-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_americas_russian-navy-cuba-intl", "text": "A group of Russian Navy ships, including a nuclear-powered submarine, arrived in Cuba on Wednesday morning in a sign of strengthening ties between the two Cold War allies. Russian frigate Admiral Gorshkov \u2013 the first of a four-ship convoy \u2013 fired a 21-gun salute after entering Havana harbor, which was answered by the Cubans with cannon fire from an 18th-century\u00a0colonial fort built by the Spanish to guard the port. The Gorshkov is one of the Russian Navy\u2019s most modern ships, and was followed by the nuclear-powered submarine Kazan, a rescue tug, and an oil tanker. Onlookers and fishermen lined the seafront to watch the vessels arrive in the harbor. A CNN team on the ground saw members of the small Russian community in Cuba and Russian diplomats carrying national flags to welcome the crews. Some of the Cubans present told CNN they had never seen a submarine enter the bay of Havana before. The four Russian ships are now docked in berths usually occupied by cruise ships. It marks the largest show of force by the Russians with their longstanding ally Cuba in many years. The US assesses that the Kazan does not have nuclear weapons on board, a US official said. The vessels will carry out a five-day official visit to the Caribbean island \u2013 a show of Russian force just 90 miles from Florida as tensions rise between the US and Russia over the war in Ukraine. Cubans will be permitted to tour the frigate following the arrival of the convoy of ships, a Russian diplomatic source told CNN. The Russian diplomat told CNN that starting Thursday, \u201cthe general public\u201d in\u00a0Cuba\u00a0will be allowed to tour the Gorshkov frigate for four hours each day for three days. Military analysts believe it is capable of long-range missions, anti-submarine warfare, and carrying\u00a0surface-to-surface and surface-to-air missiles, among other weapons\u00a0systems. US Navy \u2018monitors\u2019 exercises En route to Cuba, the Russian warships conducted drills in the Atlantic, the Russian Ministry of Defense said Tuesday. The crews of the frigate and the nuclear submarine missile cruiser practiced the use of high-precision missile weapons using computer simulation for naval targets, designating ship groupings of a simulated enemy located at a distance of over 600 km, according to the Russian MOD, Russian state media TASS\u00a0reports. US officials told CNN that the\u00a0US\u00a0military\u00a0had deployed ships and planes to monitor Russia\u2019s\u00a0military\u00a0exercises in the Atlantic and the Caribbean,\u00a0and has been\u00a0tracking\u00a0the Russian vessels as they transited the Atlantic in recent days en route to Cuba. US\u00a0Navy ships that have been\u00a0tracking\u00a0the Russian vessels include the\u00a0USS Truxtun, the\u00a0USS Donald Cook, and Coast Guard vessel the\u00a0USCGC Stone, the\u00a0US\u00a0official confirmed. The\u00a0US\u00a0has also deployed air\u00a0assets, including a P-8 Poseidon reconnaissance plane, to circle overhead the Russian vessels. Canada has also deployed\u00a0assets\u00a0to monitor the activity, the official said. The official added that the\u00a0US\u00a0has been monitoring the flotilla\u2019s movements \u201cthe whole time,\u201d which is a normal part of the\u00a0US\u2019 maritime homeland defense, and all vessels including the Russians have remained in international waters. Pentagon and State Department officials have also sought to emphasize that the Russian activity is routine and poses no threat to the\u00a0US, and have noted that\u00a0Cuba has hosted Russian ships every year between 2013 and 2020. Still, the Russian transit to the region comes at a particularly tense moment between Washington and Moscow, several weeks after President Joe Biden agreed to allow Ukraine to strike inside Russia directly\u00a0using\u00a0US-provided weapons. Stopover \u2018does not represent a threat\u2019 Cuba\u00a0said last week that such visits were standard practice by naval units from countries friendly to Havana, and insisted the stopover does not represent a threat to the region. \u201cVisits by naval units from other countries are a historical practice of the revolutionary government with nations that maintain relations of friendship and collaboration,\u201d a statement from Cuba\u2019s Foreign Ministry said. According to a Cuban Armed Forces Ministry statement, none of the Russian ships are armed with nuclear weapons. Cuba has long had good relations with Russia. It was a key ally to the former Soviet Union during the Cold War that briefly hosted nuclear missiles at Moscow\u2019s behest during the 1962\u00a0Cuban Missile Crisis. The arrival of the ships on Wednesday signals Moscow\u2019s strengthening ties with Havana in light of Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine. Cuba is also increasingly reliant on Russian oil and aid as the communist-run country weathers its\u00a0worst economic crisis in decades.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/americas/russian-navy-cuba-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_middleeast_un-report-israel-hamas-gaza-war-crimes-intl-hnk", "text": "A United Nations inquiry into the first few months of the war in Gaza has found both Israel and Hamas committed war crimes and grave violations of international law, in the body\u2019s first in-depth investigation into the October 7 attacks and the ensuing conflict. The damning reports released Wednesday, which cover events up to the end of 2023,\u00a0paint an alarming picture of both sides routinely disregarding international law in a devastating conflict that has now raged for more than eight months, bitterly dividing global opinion and sending tensions soaring across the Middle East. The findings were strongly disputed by Israel. The United Nations Commission of Inquiry\u2019s reports begin on October 7, the day Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups launched a murder and kidnapping spree in southern Israel which\u00a0killed more than\u00a01,200 people, mostly civilians, and saw some 250 people taken hostage. War crimes cited by the commission that day included intentionally directing attacks against civilians,\u00a0murder or willful killing, torture, inhuman or cruel treatment, outrages upon personal dignity, and taking hostages, including children. The massacres that day prompted Israel\u00a0to declare war on Hamas and launch an assault on Gaza that has destroyed much of the heavily populated enclave and killed more than 37,000 people, according to Gaza health authorities. In the first 2.5 months of the conflict, the commission found, Israel committed war crimes as well as crimes against humanity \u2013 the latter defined as a widespread, systemic attack directed at a civilian population. Israel\u2019s alleged war crimes include starvation, arbitrary detention, and killing and maiming \u201ctens of thousands of children.\u201d Both Israel and Hamas committed sexual violence and torture, and intentionally attacked civilians, according to the reports, which span more than 200 pages. The commission said its findings were based on interviews with victims and witnesses, thousands of open-source items verified through forensic analysis, hundreds of submissions, satellite imagery, forensic medical reports and media coverage, including several key CNN investigations. Israel previously announced its refusal to cooperate with the inquiry. CNN is reaching out Hamas for comment. In response to the report, Israel accused the fact-finding mission of \u201cattempting to justify\u201d Hamas\u2019 actions, of showing \u201csystematic anti-Israeli discrimination,\u201d and contextualizing the attacks \u201cthrough the lens of the Palestinian narrative.\u201d Israel\u2019s mission to the UN said Wednesday that the report did not mention continuous rocket fire on the country and claimed that it \u201coutrageously and repugnantly attempts to draw a false equivalence between IDF (Israel Defense Forces) soldiers and Hamas terrorists with regards to acts of sexual violence,\u201d adding that the Israeli military conducts itself in accordance to international law, including international humanitarian law. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday that the United States continues \u201cto do the work to make our own assessments\u201d on whether there have been violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in the war in Gaza. Speaking at a news conference in Doha, the top US diplomat said he had not seen the new UN findings, but said that \u201cof course we\u2019ll look at that.\u201d The reports released Wednesday add to previous allegations made against Israel by other major international bodies. The International Criminal Court announced last month it was seeking arrest warrants for several top Hamas and Israeli leaders, including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity. At the time, both Hamas and Israel decried the charges \u2013 with Hamas describing it as an attempt to \u201cequate victims with aggressors,\u201d and Netanyahu calling it a \u201cpolitical outrage.\u201d And in February, the Israeli military denied accusations by UN experts of human rights violations against Palestinian girls and women in Gaza and the West Bank \u2013 calling the claims \u201cdespicable and unfounded.\u201d October 7 attacks The report examined Hamas\u2019 actions during the October 7 attacks, which it described as\u00a0\u201cunprecedented in scale in (Israel\u2019s) modern history\u2026 invoking painful trauma of past persecution not only for Israeli Jews but for Jewish people everywhere.\u201d Hamas militants abducted hostages \u201cwithout regard for age or gender,\u201d with some shot at, killed, and paraded around, the report said. In particular, they targeted women, whose bodies were \u201cused as victory trophies by male perpetrators\u2026 (and) put on public display, either on the streets of the Gaza Strip or online,\u201d it found. The commission said it had \u201cdocumented evidence of sexual violence\u201d carried out by Palestinian armed groups in several locations in southern Israel on October 7. The commission had also reviewed rape testimonies collected by journalists and Israeli police but said it was unable to independently verify these due to lack of access to the victims or crime sites, and because Israel obstructed its investigations. The report authors singled out the toll on Israeli children \u2013 many of whom witnessed the murders of their parents and siblings, and were targeted for abduction. Israeli forces inflicting \u2018maximum damage\u2019 In Israel\u2019s subsequent attack on Hamas, the commission wrote, its forces aimed to inflict \u201cmaximum damage\u201d without taking enough precautions \u2013 which led to a staggering death toll in Gaza, devastating injuries, and destruction of civilian infrastructure. \u201cThe deliberate use of heavy weaponry by Israeli security forces with large destructive capabilities in densely populated areas constitutes an intentional and direct attack on the civilian population, particularly affecting women and children,\u201d the commission said. It also referenced CNN reporting that found that\u00a0nearly half of the air-to-ground munitions\u00a0Israel used in Gaza were unguided, meaning they\u00a0were less precise and posed a greater threat to civilians in the densely populated strip. Asked for comment at the time, IDF spokesperson Nir Dinar told CNN: \u201cWe do not address the type of munitions used.\u201d The UN\u2019s report cited two other CNN investigations that showed Israeli forces intentionally killing civilians who posed no threat, often along evacuation routes and in designated safe areas. The siege of Gaza represents a \u201ccollective punishment against the civilian population,\u201d according to the\u00a0UN report \u2013 which accused Israel of withholding critical goods like water, food, electricity, fuel and humanitarian aid for \u201cstrategic and political gains.\u201d Sexual violence and inflammatory rhetoric The report detailed allegations of Israeli forces carrying out sexual violence in both Gaza and the Israel-occupied West Bank \u2013 intended to drive home \u201cthe subordination of an occupied people.\u201d Victims were allegedly interrogated or abused while naked or partially dressed, blindfolded, and made to kneel or keep their hands tied behind their backs, the report found. Many were forced to strip in public and walk while being sexually harassed, with their family members forced to watch. While both men and women were victims of sexual violence, men and boys were targeted in particular. The report also highlighted the inflammatory rhetoric used by senior Israeli officials, including the president and prime minister, which the UN commission said amounted to incitement and \u201cmay constitute other serious international crimes.\u201d Some Israeli officials had called for \u201cviolence and the killing of Palestinians, the erasure of the Gaza Strip, vengeance, collective punishment, noting that there are no innocent civilians in the Gaza Strip, planning for new Israeli settlements on the rubble of the Gaza Strip and calling for the removal of Palestinians from Gaza to third states,\u201d the report said, without attributing to specific officials. Some of the most extreme statements in Israel\u2019s deeply divided cabinet have come from far-right members like National Security Minister Itamar\u00a0Ben Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich. They are often condemned by other cabinet members like Benny Gantz, who resigned on Sunday, and\u00a0Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. UN-Israel tensions The commission, which was set up by the UN Human Rights Council in 2021 after an 11-day conflict that killed more than 200 people in both Israel and Gaza, said Israel had obstructed its access to both Israel and Palestinian territories during the investigation. It said Israeli officials had barred medical professionals and other personnel from speaking to investigators, and did not respond to any UN requests for information. The commission also requested information from the Palestinian Authority, which governs the West Bank, it said. The Palestinian Authority provided \u201cextensive comments\u201d and indicated they would welcome a visit by the UN, the commission said. Hamas, a rival to the Palestinian Authority, governs Gaza and it was not clear from the report whether the authors had also contacted the militant group. In December, Israeli Ambassador to the UN\u00a0Gilad Erdan accused the UN\u2019s Human Rights Council of being \u201cmorally distorted\u201d and antisemitic. Erdan called its investigation \u201c100% biased against Israel,\u201d and said Israel would not cooperate. The UN and Israel\u2019s long-strained relations have sunk to a historic low in recent months, with senior UN officials highly critical of Israel\u2019s war conduct in Gaza. The UN Security Council \u2013 which Israel is not part of \u2013 tried for months after October 7 to pass a resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire. The US, Israel\u2019s closest ally and its main weapons supplier, consistently used its veto power to block such a move \u2013 until it finally abstained in March, allowing the resolution to pass, which was immediately lambasted by Israel. And last month, a non-binding vote at the UN General Assembly showed\u00a0overwhelming international support\u00a0for an independent Palestinian state \u2013 leaving the US and Israel\u2019s allies isolated. Israel and the US maintain that a Palestinian state should only be established through a negotiated settlement. Another sticking point is UNRWA, the UN\u2019s agency for Palestinian refugees, which plays a central role in feeding and sheltering hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees. Israeli officials have long criticized UNRWA, accusing it of diverting aid to Hamas as well as having Hamas members in its ranks. More than a dozen countries suspended funding to the agency after Israel\u00a0accused at least 12 UNRWA staffers\u00a0of being involved in the October 7 terrorist attacks. Most have since resumed funding. In March, the agency accused Israel of detaining and torturing some of its staffers, coercing them into making false confessions about the agency\u2019s ties to Hamas. In recent months, UNRWA has faced threats, harassment and violence perpetrated by Israelis \u2013 with the East Jerusalem headquarters set on fire while staff were inside. CNN cannot confirm the allegations by Israel or UNRWA. In their report on Wednesday, the commission authors urged Israel to immediately call a ceasefire, for Hamas to release hostages, for Israel to end its practices of sexual abuse against Palestinians, and to allow access for further investigations. \u201cIt is imperative that all those who have committed crimes be held accountable,\u201d said commission chair Navi Pillay. \u201cThe only way to stop the recurring cycles of violence, including aggression and retribution by both sides, is to ensure strict adherence to international law.\u201d This story has been updated.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/middleeast/un-report-israel-hamas-gaza-war-crimes-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_style_king-charles-portrait-vandalized", "text": "Activists from an animal rights group have vandalized the first official portrait of King Charles, currently on display in a London gallery. Campaign group Animal Rising posted a video on its social media channels on Tuesday showing two activists using a paint roller to stick signs over the portrait of the monarch. Members of the public have been free to visit the portrait of the monarch, which is on display at the Philip Mould gallery in central London until June 21. The painting, the first official portrait of King Charles as monarch, raised eyebrows when it was unveiled earlier this year. Artist Jonathon Yeo depicted the king against a background of crimson red brush strokes, sparking mixed reactions. Activists covered the king\u2019s head with an image of the British cartoon character Wallace, from the \u201cWallace and Gromit\u201d comedy series. A speech bubble sign was then also tacked onto the painting with the following caption: \u201cNo cheese Gromit, look at all of this cruelty on RSCPA farms.\u201d The action was designed to bring attention to a new report, released on Sunday by the group, which investigated 45 farms whose welfare standards are guaranteed by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA). The RSPCA\u2019s Assured scheme promises that animals in protected farms are given more living space and are never kept in cages. Meat, fish and dairy products produced by these farms are marked with the RSCPA logo. Animal Rising described their findings as \u201cdamning,\u201d alleging that they found \u201csevere animal cruelty\u201d at all farms visited. Last month, King Charles became the royal patron of the RSPCA. In a statement provided to British newspaper The Telegraph, an Animal Rising activist explained, \u201cWith King Charles being such a big fan of \u2018Wallace and Gromit,\u2019 we couldn\u2019t think of a better way to draw his attention to the horrific scenes on RSPCA Assured farms! Even though we hope this is amusing to His Majesty, we also call on him to seriously reconsider if he wants to be associated with the awful suffering across farms being endorsed by the RSPCA.\u201d (During a 2012 engagement at Clarence House for the late Queen Elizabeth\u2019s Diamond Jubilee, Queen Camilla told a group of children of her husband that \u201cWallace and Gromit are his favorite people in the world.\u201d) Animal Rising describes itself as a non-violent organization campaigning for an \u201curgent transition to a sustainable and just plant-based food system.\u201d It is also petitioning for the RSPCA\u2019s Assured scheme, which it says covers up \u201ccruelty on an industrial scale,\u201d to be scrapped. The RSPCA responded to Animal Rising\u2019s claims in a statement provided to CNN on Tuesday, stating that \u201cany concerns about welfare on RSPCA Assured certified farms are taken extremely seriously and RSPCA Assured is acting swiftly to look into these allegations.\u201d \u201cWe have responded openly and transparently to Animal Rising\u2019s challenges to our farming work,\u201d the statement continued. \u201cWhile we understand that Animal Rising, like us, want the best for animals, their activity is a distraction and a challenge to the work we are all doing to create a better world for every animal.\u201d The organization also said it was \u201cshocked\u201d by the vandalism of the painting. \u201cWe welcome scrutiny of our work, but we cannot condone illegal activity of any kind,\u201d their statement read. According to Philip Mould, owner of the gallery where the portrait is on display, the painting sustained \u201cno damage\u201d since it was protected by a layer of Perspex. Mould told CNN the adhesive stickers used by the activists stayed on the portrait for \u201cless than ten seconds.\u201d The activists left the premises after being asked to do so, Mould said, adding that the gallery has also filed a police report. There are currently no plans to curtail the display of the painting, although staff will remain \u201con alert\u201d after the incident, Mould said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/style/king-charles-portrait-vandalized/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "world"}}

The Sukhoi Su-57 fighter, nicknamed the \u201cFelon\u201d by NATO, was struck on the tarmac of an airbase in the Astrakhan region, almost 600 kilometers (372 miles) behind the front lines of fighting in Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, according to Ukraine\u2019s defense intelligence agency (GUR). The agency posted satellite pictures in a post on its Telegram channel to support its claim, writing, \u201cThe images show that on June 7, Su-57 was still intact, but on June 8, craters from the explosion and distinctive fire spots emerged near it as a result of the fire damage.\u201d The Su-57 is a supersonic, twin-engine, fifth-generation stealth fighter jet and was seen as Moscow\u2019s answer to Western stealth jets like the US Air Force\u2019s F-22 Raptor. But its development, which began in 2002, according to the US military, has been slow, and an Su-57 crashed during a 2019 test flight. The Russian military received its first Su-57 in 2020, according to a report by the state-run TASS news agency, which said the jet was earlier \u201ctested\u201d in combat conditions in Syria in 2018. The Ukrainian Telegram post noted the Su-57\u2019s ability to carry Kh-59 and Kh-69 cruise missiles, which the jet could launch against Ukraine from the safety of Russian airspace. While experts have expressed doubts on the Su-57\u2019s capabilities compared to the F-22, Russian officials have praised its role in attacks on Ukraine. In a 2022 TASS report, then Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu said the Su-57 \u201chas shown itself brilliantly.\u201d \u201cThe aircraft has a very high degree of protection against various air defense systems, has protection against missiles \u2026 Most importantly, it has very powerful weapons. We also tried and tested these weapons, they work brilliantly,\u201d Shoigu said at the time. The exact number of combat-ready Su-57s available to Russia\u2019s air force is unclear. Flight Global\u2019s \u201cWorld Air Forces 2024\u201d directory lists 14 Su-57s as active and another 62 as on order. \u201cThe Russian Aerospace Forces currently have only a limited number of these combat aircraft in service,\u201d the GUR Telegram post said. TASS reported in 2022 that Russian forces will receive a total of 22 Su-57s by the end of this year. If the reports of the Ukrainian drone strike deep inside Russia prove true, it marks another success of Kyiv\u2019s low-cost drones taking out high-value Russian assets. The price of an Su-57 is estimated to be $35 million to $54 million, according to the Foreign Policy Research Institute. Drone strikes have become an increasing problem for Moscow. Other Ukrainian drones have been used to sink or severely damage Russian warships in the Black Sea, and tanks and armored vehicles have fallen prey to drones on the battlefield. The attack would also bring new worries for Russia in protecting bases far back from the battlefield. \u201cThis is a really a trend that the Russians are worried about,\u201d said CNN contributor Jill Dougherty, the network\u2019s former Moscow bureau chief. \u201cThe Ukrainians are attacking more and more inside Russia and taking the battle to them,\u201d Dougherty said. After reports of the strike surfaced, Russian military bloggers criticized the military for not building hangars to protect the Su-57s, noting that protective hangars could be constructed at every air base for the price of one Su-57, according to the Institute for the Study of War.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/europe/ukraine-drone-strike-destroys-russian-su57-stealth-fighter-intl-hnk-ml/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_06_12_style_jack-lueders-booth-female-prisoners", "text": "What is perhaps most striking about the 32 photographs that make up Jack Lueders-Booth\u2019s new book, \u201cWomen Prisoner Polaroids,\u201d is the intimacy that occupies each frame. Inmates wear their own clothes and pose in cells embellished with personal effects, much like any regular college dorm room; one woman clasps a biography of Mick Jagger, others are pictured with their arms wrapped around friends. A warm sensibility, typically foreign to portraits of incarceration, is notable throughout. \u201cMiriam Van Waters, the first superintendent at Massachusetts Correctional Institute Framingham (in 1932), was insistent that they not use this unfortunate period in their lives to form their identity,\u201d the photographer told CNN in a video interview, relaying the Massachusetts\u2019 prison\u2019s early objectives. \u201cTo foster that, she tried to make it look like home. For that reason, (when I was there) the inmates wore domestic clothes and prison guards were also un-uniformed. Often the same age as the prisoners, many of them were studying criminal justice at Northeastern University, a co-operative college.\u201d Established in 1878 as a reformatory confining women for the crime of having children out of wedlock, by the 1970s much of the prison\u2019s population were being held on counts of shoplifting and sex work, or as accomplices to crimes of male companions. As per Van Waters\u2019 previous intentions, the facility was at that time the site of many experiments in rehabilitation, an effort intended to reduce the psychological toll of being incarcerated. \u2018We came to trust each other\u2019 Lueders-Booth arrived in 1977, initially to spend just a year running a photography course as part of his master\u2019s thesis for Harvard\u2019s Graduate School of Education (though already lecturing at the college, he didn\u2019t have a teaching degree). \u201cI had specific ideas about what I wanted to do,\u201d he recalled. \u201cTeach photography to people in institutions of confinement, as a way of increasing morale and teaching them a skill.\u201d The invitation to MCI-Framingham was serendipitous: another Harvard professor headed up a prison arts project and happened to be looking for someone to initiate a photography course. Accompanied by his 18-year-old daughter, Laura \u2014 \u201cshe gave me a level of credibility, that this old guy knew something about youth\u201d \u2014 Lueders-Booth was given a corridor of old cells to run his program, which the pair transformed into studios and darkrooms. With classes of about 10 women at a time, the groups began by creating photograms (photographic prints made by laying objects onto photographic paper before exposing it to light), eventually moving into portraiture. \u201cI was apprehensive about them and they about me. I didn\u2019t know anything (about the prison system) except for what I\u2019d seen in the media,\u201d the photographer noted of those early sessions. \u201cBut we came to trust each other in a matter of months. They had confidence in me that I was there to help them.\u201d The Polaroid pictures, which the photographer shot alongside a wider black and white series, weren\u2019t intentional, he suggested. In 1980 however, having been awarded two consecutive fellowships with the instant camera company, Lueders-Booth had access to infinite film and began making, \u201cprobably the most important project I did in my life. It was rewarding and wonderful, the comfort and trust with which the women came to the experience of being photographed.\u201d He would end up staying on at Framingham for seven years, only concluding his workshops in the mid-80s, in which time he had become an accepted feature amongst staff and inmates alike. \u201cI had increasing access and became quite trusted by the administration. I was doing photography for them, making portraits for their annual reports, and sometimes processing family photographs,\u201d said Lueders-Booth. \u201cOver the years, my photographs were appearing on their walls as part of their photo collections, which was very rewarding. I felt I was contributing something, and that was important.\u201d \u201cThe women and the unusual character of their lives kept drawing me back,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt became an education, about this prison but also the unfairness of the system and how much depends on the womb factor \u2014 where you come from, how you were nurtured. Many of the incarcerations were economically determined. So I came to appreciate the humanity of it, really, that was the largest thing. That these women were very much the victim of circumstances.\u201d A collection of anonymous testimonies closes the book, largely highlighting vehement accounts of the women\u2019s experiences of arriving and returning to the prison. Their fervent words, recorded objectively by Lueders-Booth, initially appear contrary to the relaxed composure exhibited in the images which precede them; ultimately however, this speaks to the work\u2019s broader function. \u201cVery often, the most obvious characteristic of a person is not the most significant,\u201d observed the photographer. \u201cI may have identified them as a prisoner, but that\u2019s dismissive and superficial. While it is true, other things are true, and many other things are perhaps more true.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/style/jack-lueders-booth-female-prisoners/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "world"}}

There\u2019s the Art Deco curved crown of the Chrysler Building, the sweeping isosceles triangles that twist around One World Trade Center, the stepped limestone and granite rectangles of the Empire State Building and the triangular prism of the Flatiron Building. And now, a multi-billion-dollar tower featuring floor-to-ceiling glass will add another dimension to the cityscape, according to new details unveiled by New York City Mayor Eric Adams this week. Stretching up 62 stories, a planned office tower at 350 Park Avenue will provide space for more than 6,000 jobs, plus 1.8 million square feet of commercial office space, according to a press release. It will be funded by Vornado Realty Trust, Kenneth Griffin, founder and CEO of global investment firm Citadel, and building and management company Rudin. White columns will frame a new public concourse at the base of the new building on Park Avenue, complete with green space, seating and art displays, images show. Above, landscaped terraces will top each section of the glass-clad tower which will house the offices for Citadel and market making firm Citadel Securities.

As New York continues to deal with the economic aftershocks wrought by the Covid-19 pandemic, Adams and his administration said in their respective statements that they hoped this project would continue the city\u2019s recovery. \u201cThis investment opens a new chapter for Midtown \u2014 and closes the book on those who predicted its demise,\u201d said deputy mayor for operations Meera Joshi. \u201cMidtown\u2019s revitalization is being led by its public realm \u2014 including investments in Fifth Avenue, with the crown jewels of Central Park and Bryant Park at either end.

Building this new office space comes at a fraught time for the commercial real estate market as businesses struggle to entice workers back to the office after years of working from home. This has left vast tranches of office space vacant or underused, causing the value of such buildings to plummet at the same time as historically high interest rates have made it harder for real estate developers \u2014\u00a0who often take out huge loans to finance projects \u2014\u00a0to make good on their repayments.

Around 150 people were living in the block when fire broke out on the ground floor, police official Sayyed Hasan Ebrahim told Kuwaiti state television. The cause of the fire, which has been contained, is unknown but the presence of more than 20 cooking gas tanks and flammable material in the overcrowded block caused it to spread quickly, Ebrahim said.

He warned the death toll could rise, adding that 11 people were being treated in hospitals. Authorities had identified three of the bodies, he said, but did not say if their families had been notified.

The unit welcomed the lifting of the ban on receiving security assistance from the US, saying in a statement Tuesday, \u201cThis is a new page in the history of our unit.\u201d \u201cEligibility for US assistance will not only increase Azov\u2019s combat effectiveness, but, most importantly, will help save the lives and health of the brigade\u2019s personnel,\u201d the unit said. \u201cAzov is becoming more professional and more effective in defending Ukraine against the invaders.\u201d Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov condemned the US decision on Tuesday, saying the US is \u201cready even to flirt with neo-Nazis,\u201d according to Russian state news agency TASS. Major battles Founded as a militia to defend Ukraine against Russia\u2019s invasion in 2014, the unit was initially called the \u201cAzov Battalion,\u201d active around the Mariupol area. Ukraine\u2019s Ministry of Defense encouraged at the time volunteer battalions to help the army and resistance efforts. Later that year, the Azov battalion was \u201creorganized and expanded into the Azov Special Police Regiment of the Ministry of Internal Affairs,\u201d before becoming part of the National Guard, according to its website. In 2015, Azov fighters liberated Mariupol and its surroundings from occupation, pushing Russian forces far away from the city. They took part in several major battles in Donetsk region. The battalion has said it repeatedly denies \u201callegations of fascism, nazism and racism,\u201d in response to claims it had associations with White supremacists and neo-Nazi ideology. The US State Department said Tuesday that Russian disinformation \u201chas actively worked to discredit\u201d the unit. \u201cThey have long tried to conflate Ukraine\u2019s National Guard Unit of 12th Special Forces Brigade Azov with a militia formed to defend Ukraine against Russia\u2019s invasion in 2014, called the \u201cAzov Battalion,\u201d a State Department spokesperson said. \u201cThat militia disbanded in 2015 and the Special Forces Brigade Azov is unrelated to that militia.\u201d After applying the Leahy vetting process, the State Department \u201cfound no evidence of Gross Violations of Human Rights\u201d committed by the 12th Azov Special Forces Brigade. Russian Ambassador to the United States, Anatoly Antonov, said Tuesday the steps taken by Washington \u201ccan cause nothing but extreme indignation.\u201d He called the brigade \u201can openly nationalist formation\u201d and said Moscow is concerned over \u201cUS approaches in the fight against terrorism.\u201d After the bombing of a Mariupol theater in 2022 that was sheltering civilians and had the word \u201cchildren\u201d written in Russian on the ground on either side of the building, the Russian Defense Ministry accused \u201cmilitants of the nationalist \u2018Azov\u2019 battalion\u201d of carrying out the attack. At the time, local\u00a0Ukrainian officials blamed Russia for the attack, which is believed to have killed hundreds who were sheltering in the theater amid heavy bombardment in the early days of Russia\u2019s invasion. The city of Mariupol has become a symbol of Ukrainian resistance, after Ukrainian soldiers, including members of the Azov unit, and residents sheltered for weeks underground at the city\u2019s massive Azovstal steelworks plant refusing to surrender to Russian forces.

{"id": "2024_06_08_americas_edmundo-gonzalez-venezuela-profile-intl-latam", "text": "Restraint is a rare quality for a politician, especially in Venezuela, a country whose recent leaders have been synonymous with vitriolic populism. Hugo Chavez, the late president who still casts a formidable shadow across the country more than ten years after his death, used to speak for hours on his television show,\u00a0Hello President!, while his firebrand successor, incumbent President Nicolas Maduro, is equally capable of clocking 60-plus minutes of uninterrupted oratory when the mood takes him. So it\u2019s telling that the man tasked with challenging Maduro in Venezuela\u2019s presidential election next month is a man of few words. Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia, the official candidate of a large opposition coalition known as the Democratic Unitary Platform, has a habit of answering his questions in single sentences, often stopping before the interviewer has the time to think of a follow-up. It\u2019s an unexpected approach from a presidential candidate aiming to drum up voter enthusiasm in order to take on an authoritarian leader who in the last ten years has dug into power by allegedly rigging elections and\u00a0violating human rights. But Gonzalez is not your typical Venezuelan politician. After decades in the foreign service (he was an ambassador to Algeria and Argentina) and then as a back bench manager for Venezuela\u2019s opposition, Gonzalez was only selected as a coalition candidate because two other opposition leaders \u2013 Maria Corina Machado and Corina Yoris \u2013 had been barred from running and a deadline was looming. \u201cI never imagined I would find myself in this situation,\u201d he told Venezuelan media in late April, shortly after his candidature was formalized. Yet since then, his poise and calm have helped him build a comfortable lead against Maduro, according to recent polls. Opposition, a dangerous business Challenging Maduro\u2019s near total grip on power can be a dangerous business. Over the years, he has jailed or exiled dozens of opposition leaders, some of them for years. And hundreds of people have been killed in political violence in Venezuela in the past decade, often at the hands of state security forces. But most analysts agree Gonzalez represents the best chance that Venezuela\u2019s political opposition has had to dislodge Maduro from power since 2013. His name is already on the ballot for the July 28 presidential vote, and the government has so far shown little appetite for going after him. In October, the Maduro government and the opposition, along with representatives from the United States, signed a comprehensive agreement in Barbados where Maduro pledged to hold free and fair elections in exchange for sanctions relief from Washington. Since then, there have been mixed signals on both sides about the extent of the deal: US-imposed oil sanctions have only partially been lifted and most of Maduro\u2019s close circle is still subject to individual sanctions, while on May 28, Caracas withdrew an invitation for the European Union to send electoral observers to monitor the upcoming vote. Gonzalez claims he\u2019s not worried about possible persecution, telling CNN En Espa\u00f1ol that he is \u201cvery calm, confident although aware of the enormous challenge\u201d the opposition is up against. Asked about the prospect of a repeat of the 2018 election, which Maduro won amid widespread allegations of vote-rigging and a boycott by the opposition, Gonzalez says he hopes pressure from other countries will force Maduro\u2019s hand. Most experts say the international community is unlikely to intervene in Venezuela again after the debacle of the 2019 opposition uprising led by Juan Guaido, the then-opposition leader who swore himself in as interim president and was recognized by more than fifty countries \u2013 only for Maduro to retain power and ride out the storm unscathed. But Gonzalez seems buoyant nonetheless. \u201cFraud, vote rigging, and threats are nothing new for us,\u201d Gonzalez told CNN En Espa\u00f1ol, \u201cBut we\u2019re confident that on the day the opposition vote will be so massive our victory will be indisputable.\u201d His family is not so tranquil. \u201cWe are worried, no doubt,\u201d Gonzalez\u2019s daughter Mariana told CNN. \u201cBut we\u2019re trying to live one day at a time, because if we start thinking of what could happen, this or that, we stop moving,\u201d she said. The biggest question But how to convince an authoritarian government entrenched in power for decades to voluntarily give up control and lead a democratic transition? Gonzalez has never offered an answer to the question that hangs the July vote. Instead of detailing a roadmap to democracy, he has only hinted at what steps he would take should he win in July and the electoral authority effectively certify the result. He said his biggest priorities would be\u00a0taming\u00a0inflation, another of Venezuela\u2019s chronic ills\u00a0and\u00a0currently running at 64% year on year, and restoring trust in\u00a0the\u00a0institutions of power\u00a0such as the judiciary, currently stacked by Maduro\u2019s sympathizers. The fate of the incumbent and his closest allies \u2013 several of whom are under investigation in the Hague for crimes against humanity \u2013 remain in the balance. But amnesty for outgoing officials could be on the table, Gonzalez told CNN en Espa\u00f1ol. \u201cIn all political transitions and political crises, you have amnesty agreements and transitional justice. All the countries who have gone through situations like ours have ended up granting it, so I don\u2019t rule out we could take a similar measure in Venezuela,\u201d he said. While the election is slated for late July, Venezuela law mandates that the winning candidate won\u2019t take office before January 2025 \u2013 creating a delicate 6-month handover period that Gonzalez would have to manage carefully if he wins. \u201cThose six months will be key for him as a president-elect, while the entire state apparatus remains under the control of the regime,\u201d said Sadio Garavini di Tullio, a classmate of Gonzalez who also served in the foreign office and helped manage the opposition in the Chavez years. \u201cEdmundo however can be that person; he can give a lot of guarantees to everyone involved with the regime.\u201d \u201cHe will not be the president of the opposition government, he\u2019ll be the president of the transition government,\u201d Garavini di Tullio said. George Eickhoff, a German diplomat who served as director of the Konrad Adenauer Foundation in Caracas between 2008 and 2013 and remains close to Gonzalez, made a similar point. \u201cEdmundo is a public servant, he knows there cannot be any revenge [against the government],\u201d Eickhoff told CNN. \u201cHe has already started to speak to the other side: for the opposition, Machado is the firebrand messenger to galvanize its base, while Edmundo is an extension of the soft message, he\u2019s very realistic about his task.\u201d Asked about the possibility of vote-rigging by the Maduro regime, Gonzalez was sanguine. \u201cWe\u2019re aware we\u2019re facing an enemy,\u201d he began \u2013 then corrected himself, softening the message: \u201cAn adversary that has no qualms about using any advantage the system gives them.\u201d Grandfather figure The dual message has been visible throughout this first month of the political campaigning period, with Machado, a long-time conservative politician who first ran for president in 2012, holding public rallies in every street, while Gonzalez has dispensed calmness from his home in Caracas. When Gonzalez\u2019s candidature was formalized in April, a portrait of him by Bloomberg photographer Gaby Oraa went viral in Venezuela. It shows the candidate feeding four colorful tropical parrots called\u00a0guacamayas, typical of Caracas. Across the city, citizens routinely feed these wild birds who can display a pet-like loyalty. \u201cThey come every day, two, three, four\u2026 sometimes even ten. They are his friends,\u201d said Mariana, Gonzalez\u2019s daughter. \u201cThe\u00a0guacamayas\u00a0come in the morning and in the evening, he can spend hours just feeding them sunflower seeds. He takes care of them.\u201d His other passions, according to those who know him well, are baseball, the Real Madrid football club, family barbecues, and reading. Fans see in him a grandfather-of-the-nation type figure who could usher in a new era after the political violence of the last decade, pointing to his electoral slogan \u201cEdmundo, president for all\u201d, as well as his age (73) and family situation (he has four grandchildren). Two of those grandchildren now live in Spain, among the more than seven million Venezuelans who have fled the country in recent years. He hopes that an opposition victory in July would encourage at least some of that diaspora to return. \u201cIt\u2019s time for the big Venezuelan family to come together once more,\u201d he told CNN en Espa\u00f1ol. \u201cIt\u2019s time that the adversary is respected as such, and not seen as an enemy,\u201d he added. A message again, of moderation and transition.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/08/americas/edmundo-gonzalez-venezuela-profile-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_10_tech_tesla-self-driving-cars-china-hnk-intl", "text": "Tesla is one step closer to launching full-self driving (FSD) technology in China after it clinched an agreement with Baidu to upgrade its mapping software. The Chinese tech giant said Saturday that it was providing lane-level navigation services for Tesla cars. Baidu (BIDU) says this level of navigation can provide drivers with detailed information, including making lane recommendations ahead of upcoming turns, to enhance safety. Experts said during Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk\u2019s surprise visit to China at the end of April that one of his main hurdles in securing government approval to rollout the company\u2019s FSD software was reaching a mapping and navigation deal with Baidu. \u201cWith the support of Baidu\u2019s lane-level map, Tesla\u2019s navigation can accurately render lane changes on the road the user is currently on, upgrading from providing road-level guidance to providing lane-level guidance,\u201d Baidu said in the statement. China\u2019s answer to Google has been been providing mapping services to Tesla since 2020. But prior to Saturday\u2019s announcement, its services had been limited to \u201croad-level\u201d information, which is less precise than lane-level navigation. A day earlier, Tesla launched its new software upgrade for users in urban areas in China, the world\u2019s biggest car market, saying in a statement on WeChat that such detailed road information was being made available \u201cfor the first time.\u201d CNN has reached out to Tesla for comment. On Monday, Baidu declined further comment. Virtually all Teslas have a driver-assistance system called Autopilot, while the more robust FSD feature comes at a premium price. Autopilot is available in China, but not the full FSD feature. Teaming up with Baidu would remove an obstacle, as the Chinese firm has key mapping credentials that can be applied to driver-assistance functions. According to Chinese regulations, all self-driving systems must obtain mapping qualifications before operating on public roads. Foreign car companies need to partner with licensed Chinese companies to qualify for surveying and mapping. Partnering with Baidu would allow Tesla to run its full self-driving system on China\u2019s public roads, with its vehicles able to collect surrounding data, such as road layout, traffic signs and buildings. It could also accelerate Tesla\u2019s global development of its self-driving technology, as data from China could be used to train Tesla\u2019s algorithms needed for fully autonomous vehicles. Car owners have long complained on social media about Tesla\u2019s previous navigation services, which were also provided by Baidu, saying they often have to rely on other maps available on smartphones while driving. \u201cThis time, you can really remove your mobile phone holders (mounted in the car),\u201d Tesla said in its Friday announcement, suggesting drivers no longer need other maps for navigation. The news went viral on Chinese social media on Monday. \u201cAfter the system upgrade, I no longer need to use my mobile phone to navigate,\u201d said one Weibo user. \u201cTesla\u2019s (own) navigation system can finally be used.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u201d Introducing the FSD system could provide a revenue boost to Tesla, which is having a tough time in China. In April, it slashed prices across its car product lines in the country, hoping to bolster sales in the face of slowing demand and increased competition.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/tech/tesla-self-driving-cars-china-hnk-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_weather_florida-flooding-hurricane-season-climate", "text": "Parts of South Florida \u2013 including the Miami and Fort Lauderdale areas \u2013 were inundated with dangerous flooding Wednesday night amid repeated bouts of torrential rain that filled neighborhoods and roadways with high waters and prompted the governor to declare an emergency Flood warnings are in effect for parts of Broward, Miami-Dade, Collier and Hendry counties through Thursday morning, according to the National Weather Service, which warned of \u201clife-threatening flooding\u201d Wednesday evening. \u201cMany areas are inundated with water w/ stalled cars & more rainfall is on the way,\u201d the weather service said Wednesday night. \u201cStay off the roadways if possible.\u201d Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis declared an emergency for Broward, Collier, Lee, Miami-Dade, and Sarasota counties, writing the heavy rain and floods has affected the \u201coperational capability of critical infrastructure,\u201d including major interstates, roadways, schools and airports. The severe weather also forced school officials in Broward County to postpone the demolition of the Marjory\u00a0Stoneman\u00a0Douglas High School building where a gunman killed 17 people in 2018 to Friday. Footage reposted on X by the weather service showed the water level reaching up to a vehicle\u2019s windows, while another video showed a parking deck filled with high flood waters. \u201cAvoid the bottom floor of parking garages,\u201d the weather service said. Fort Lauderdale Mayor Dean Trantalis declared a local state of emergency, citing \u201cexcessive rain\u201d and flooding. City officials said the heavy rainfall led to \u201chigh water\u201d on roads across the city, adding emergency management staff were deploying high water vehicles and vacuum trucks in the area. By early Wednesday night, the city had received between 7 and 8.5 inches of rainfall since midnight, Fort Lauderdale officials said on X. It was expecting up to another 5 inches overnight, officials added. The severe weather also led to hundreds of flight cancellations and delays across two of the region\u2019s main airports. At least 320 flights in and out of Miami International Airport were canceled and there were more than 280 flights flights in and out of Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport. Heavy rainfall pounded Miami and areas just to the north Wednesday afternoon, flooding a stretch of I-95. Up to 5 inches of rain fell in just a few hours, triggering flash flooding in the low-lying metro \u2013 and there\u2019s more rain to come. It\u2019s the second consecutive day the Miami area has faced down flooding issues. Storms dropped 2 to 5 inches of rain and flooded streets Tuesday. While the state is no stranger to drenching rain, heavy rain events are getting even heavier as the world warms\u00a0due to fossil fuel pollution. The daily downpours are also being fueled by a firehose of tropical moisture from parts of the Caribbean funneling straight into South Florida along a front draped over the state. Several more inches of rain are expected through the rest of the work week  from a broad and disorganized area of storms stuck over the state. By late week, the National Hurricane Center gives the storms a low chance of organizing into the first tropical depression of hurricane season as it moves off the Southeast coast. Double-digit rainfall totals are likely in parts of Florida by Friday, but a few areas in southwest Florida could approach 20 inches. The southwestern Gulf Coast of the state, from Sarasota to Everglades National Park, is at the greatest risk for rainfall totaling 10 inches or more. But bursts of intense rain outside of the highest risk areas could cause flash flooding, especially in urban or poor-drainage areas. Flood watches are in effect for more than 8 million people in South Florida Wednesday through Thursday night. The flood risk will increase through the week as storms unload drenching rain over the same area day after day, causing rainfall totals to climb, soils to saturate and area waterways to swell. If there\u2019s any silver lining, it\u2019s the rain will be beneficial to areas suffering through drought. Half of Florida is experiencing abnormal dryness or drought conditions, with the worst drought centered in the bull\u2019s-eye for the heaviest rain, according to the US Drought Monitor. How a giant gyre of moisture leads to tropical trouble The robust moisture fueling this week\u2019s storms typically pools over parts of the Caribbean Sea and the southern Gulf of Mexico at this point in the season into the Central American gyre: A large, disorganized area of showers and thunderstorms that rotates over Central America and its surrounding waters. The gyre\u2019s broad spin and deep moisture can help tropical systems form in parts of the Caribbean, the Gulf of Mexico and even the extreme eastern Pacific when other necessary factors \u2013 including favorable upper-level winds and warm ocean water\u00a0\u2013 align. The gyre typically first develops around the late spring and early summer, which is one reason most June tropical systems form in the Gulf of Mexico or off the East Coast of the US. Despite plenty of bathtub warm water in the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico, upper-level winds, known as wind shear, are much too disruptive right now for any tropical systems to form in these areas, according to Jon Rizzo, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Key West, Florida. What the gyre is doing, is juicing up the wet weather across the Gulf Coast, like what Florida will endure this week. \u201cJust the mere presence of the Central American gyre forming tells us that summer is here and the rainy season is about to begin,\u201d Jon Rizzo, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Key West, Florida, told CNN. June, July, August and September are generally the wettest months of the year for much of Florida. Frequent surges of deep, tropical moisture and the direct impact of tropical systems send rainfall totals skyrocketing during this part of the year.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/weather/florida-flooding-hurricane-season-climate/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_europe_g7-summit-italy-puglia-security-intl-cmd", "text": "Around the same time Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni announced that the G7 leaders\u2019 meeting would be held in the southern Italian region of Puglia as part of her country\u2019s presidency of the economic organization, local anti-mafia investigators were homing in on three mafia-style criminal groups alleged to be behind an uptick of violence there. The groups were showing worrying signs of trouble, according to the Italian Interior Ministry\u2019s half-yearly report released in January 2024. The prevalence of criminality recorded \u201creflects the dynamism of criminal balances and structures marked not only by conflicts between opposing clans but also by inter-clan friction,\u201d the report said. The groups are offshoots of the Sacra Corona criminal syndicate, centered around the city of Foggia and made up of crime families who group together in clans. Unlike the better-known Cosa Nostra in Sicily, the Camorra in Naples and the \u2018Ndrangheta in Calabria, which have a large international footprint, the Puglia groups work largely within Italy and the Balkans, according to DIGOS (Divisione Investigazioni Generali e Operazioni Speciali), Italy\u2019s top anti-terrorism and anti-mafia unit. Based in and around the coastal cities of Bari and Brindisi \u2013 essentially exactly where world\u2019s most powerful leaders will be meeting between June 13 and 15 \u2013 the groups had been knocking off foes in brazen daylight attacks and carrying out armed car-jackings at an alarming rate. There have been several high-profile vendetta murders among the clans in recent months, according to local media reports, and several maimings, including knee-cappings. That\u2019s not all. A briefcase was found abandoned at a train station near Bari connected to bottles of liquid and a cellphone in March. Since then, almost daily bomb threats have been received. There have also been armed raids by criminal gangs on villas close to the summit venue \u2013 an exclusive resort between Bari and Brindisi \u2013 and blatant gangland violence between the three clans, local police chief Vittorio Pisani told CNN. The Interior Ministry suggested deploying the military to wrestle back control of the region \u201cfor the good of the country.\u201d The report led to an investigation of several local town councils, three of which were dissolved by the regional governor because of mafia infiltration and the use of extortion to keep control of the territory by the criminal groups. Italian mafia groups are notorious for infiltrating legitimate projects, including construction projects, of which there have been many to prepare the venues for the upcoming summit. Roadworks, the construction of helicopter pads for the leaders to safely move around, and even the media center have been investigated, according to DIGOS. A full report is expected after the summit ends, a spokesperson for DIGOS told CNN. Days before the G7 starts, local authorities face a delicate challenge as they seek to balance the security of world leaders with maintaining local public order, according to the prefect for Brindisi, Luigi Carnevale. \u201cNo one could have predicted that leading up to the G7, scheduled from 13 to 15 June, Puglia, where the meetings between the world\u2019s powerful leaders will be held, would be affected by criminal events which, although not connected to each other, make the management of security even more complex,\u201d he said at a televised news conference. Puglia, at the heel of Italy\u2019s boot, is known for its ancient olive trees, white conical \u201ctrullo\u201d houses, and pristine beaches. The summit will be held in the luxury resort of Borgo Egnazia, a tourist haven of 30 private villas with private swimming pools and amenities like a Michelin-starred restaurant\u00a0catering to the elite. From David and Victoria Beckham to Madonna and Ivanka Trump, celebrities have been coming for years, thanks to the guarantee of discretion provided by the resort head Aldo Melpignano, who told CNN that the location was ideal for the G7. \u201cHosting the 2024 G7 in Puglia represents an extraordinary recognition for our territory, and is the result of profitable collaboration between the public and private sectors,\u201d he said. The security machine that will protect the world\u2019s leaders of the world\u2019s most advanced economies is well established, and headed by DIGOS. Preventive \u201cclean- up work\u201d has been underway for almost a year, with particular attention paid to deterring the establishment of \u201cpossible Islamic sleeper cells\u201d by monitoring arrivals by at airports and seaports, the Interior Ministry report said. A 10-kilometer (six-mile) \u201cred zone\u201d has been created around Borgo Egnazia, and a further 30-kilometer \u201cyellow zone\u201d will be strictly patrolled to protect the estimated 130 working groups and 21 ministerial meetings, not to mention ensuring the safety of special guests like Pope Francis, who will attend a special summit on artificial intelligence. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Saudi Arabia\u2019s King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud are also expected to join the leaders of the G7 nations - the United States, Germany, Britain, France, Italy, Canada and Japan. More than 5,000 specially trained soldiers have been deployed to the region, massive cruise ships are moored offshore to help keep delegations safe, and a US aircraft carrier was expected to arrive by the weekend and anchor off the Puglia coast. The Schengen open border policy that allows people to enter Italy from other Schengen Area nations has been suspended between June 5 and 18 to allow border control agents to check passports. In addition to the local crime gangs, authorities are also concerned about the hordes of protesters who show up at every G7 summit, and have called for large-scale protests to be held as close to the summit venue as possible. When Italy hosted what was then the G8 summit in 2001, a protester was killed by police during violent clashes. Specialized military police working with the anti-mafia law enforcement unit are keeping a close watch on known criminal groups. Nearly 60 people were arrested last month in connection with a drug investigation, taking some of the alleged clan leaders out of circulation, at least in the short term. \u201cIt is clear that none of these events will in the slightest put at risk the world\u2019s greats, who will be super protected and unapproachable in those three days,\u201d said Pisani, the Puglia police chief. \u201cBut it is necessary to ensure the same tranquility to the approximately 10,000 people who will move between Bari and Brindisi that week (delegations, journalists, observers) and who will not enjoy the protection of bodyguards and security services.\u201d At the same time, police must ensure they protect areas elsewhere in the province where \u201ccrime could creep in\u201d while attention is focused on Bari, he added. \u201cIt will not be an easy task because the world\u2019s spotlight will be on Puglia,\u201d Pisani said. \u201cAnd we cannot afford to convey the image of a region in which the mafia, terrorism and common crime have taken over.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/europe/g7-summit-italy-puglia-security-intl-cmd/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "travel_regent-electric-seagliders-abu-dhabi-spc", "text": "You might be used to take-offs and landings, but you soon might need to get ready to \u201cfloat, foil and fly.\u201d Those are the three phases of a journey aboard a seaglider, a new type of fully electric boat-plane hybrid that could become a mainstay of coastal communities the world over, according to its maker, Rhode Island-based startup REGENT. Just like a boat, a seaglider initially floats, then as it picks up speed it foils \u2014 gliding over the surface of the water using wing-like structures called hydrofoils, which retract as the vehicle finally takes off for the flying phase. It never reaches the sky, but rather flies up to 30 feet (nine metres) above the water, to leverage a principle called \u201cground effect,\u201d which promises a smooth ride with reduced drag compared to a normal flight. \u201cWe\u2019re going to put humans on board a full-scale, 15,000-pound (6,800-kilogram) prototype later this year,\u201d says Billy Thalheimer, co-founder and CEO of REGENT, adding that the first seagliders will carry up to 12 passengers and will have a range of about 180 miles (290 kilometers), which would put them in direct competition with small ferries and seaplanes. More than 600 seagliders have already been sold for a total of over $9 billion, according to Thalheimer. The vehicles will be manufactured in North America, but REGENT recently signed a deal with the government of Abu Dhabi to build a second plant in the United Arab Emirates, to serve clients in the region and across Europe and Asia. Once operational, seagliders will then connect Abu Dhabi to Dubai, as well as island communities that are currently underserved by existing services. \u201cWe want to prove to the world that this is possible,\u201d says Thalheimer, \u201cspecifically that in one vehicle you can float, foil and fly.\u201d A classic concept The \u201cground effect\u201d principle that the seagliders use isn\u2019t new; it was extensively tested by the Soviet Union in the 1960s, leading to some prominent examples of \u201cekranoplans\u201d \u2014 large planes designed to fly at low altitude over water, ice or land \u2014 the most famous of which is the \u201cCaspian Sea Monster.\u201d \u201cTechnically, everything that flies leverages the ground effect during take-off and landing, so everyone has experienced it \u2014 they just don\u2019t really realize it,\u201d explains Thalheimer. \u201cWhen you\u2019re coming in on a bumpy approach, then sort of get right over the runway, and the plane just sort of floats for a second before landing \u2014 that\u2019s the ground effect at work. Wouldn\u2019t that be a great place to spend the entire flight, that nice calm state over the runway?\u201d The United States and Germany also experimented with ground effect vehicles, but ultimately the concept never took off. For the seagliders, the reduced drag allows for more range with existing battery technology, and smoothes the transition with the other phases of the journey, in the harbor, that are more akin to sailing than flying. To create a modern and viable ground-effect vessel, REGENT had to solve several problems. First, Thalheimer says, seagliders are better at dealing with waves than vintage ekranoplans. \u201cThese things were skipping off the sea surface. At best, they were uncomfortable and really bumpy. At worst, you couldn\u2019t operate them at all. We solved the wave tolerance problem with the hydrofoils,\u201d he says, with full-scale seagliders able to tolerate waves up to five feet high. The second challenge was maneuverability in a harbor; because ekranoplans didn\u2019t have any waterborne steering mechanism, they were unsafe in a crowded harbor environment. The hydrofoils help, as do the three modes of operation. \u201cRather than going directly from floating to flying, we have this intermediate mode, foil. That foiling mode allows us to get through the harbor, it allows us to be a boat where it makes sense to be a boat,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd then once we get into the open water, where the traffic is truly dispersed, that\u2019s when we take off onto the wing and settle into the ground effect.\u201d The last improvement is about safety, Thalheimer says. Old ground effect vehicles were more akin to aircraft, with pilots controlling them at all times. \u201cFrom the pilot\u2019s point of view that\u2019s basically like landing a plane for the entire time you\u2019re flying it \u2014 too mentally demanding. But now we have these incredible flight control sensors and software systems that let humans do what humans are good at, which is navigating, communicating, planning, and strategizing. We\u2019re going to let the vessel fly itself and the only thing that the captain is doing now is boat controls: left and right, fast and slow. It\u2019s a highly automated system that is still controlled by a human captain.\u201d Island hopping In the summer of 2022, REGENT tested a quarter-scale prototype of its seaglider \u2014 a remotely operated version weighing 400 pounds, with a wingspan of 18 feet. The full-scale commercial vehicle, named Viceroy, will have a wingspan of 65 feet and fly between 20 and 30 feet off the sea surface Among the first customers to operate seagliders, Thalheimer says, will be Surf Air Mobility, a commuter airline that will use the vehicles to connect islands in Hawaii, and along the coastline of Miami, through Key West and out to the Bahamas. In Europe, Brittany Ferries has long expressed interest in the seagliders to connect the UK and France across the English Channel, and Thalheimer says deals are in place across the Mediterranean to connect the South of France and Italy, as well as the Greek islands. Japan Airlines and New Zealand startup Ocean Flyer will also be among the first operators, Thalheimer adds. In Abu Dhabi, the seagliders will not just support tourism operations, but existing public transport bottlenecks. \u201cSpecifically, the Abu Dhabi Department of Transport is looking to increase connections to more distant emirates like Ras Al Khaimah, which are many hours away by car today, as well as underserviced Island communities in the Gulf, like Dalma Island,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re actually seeing this kind of model apply to many other island communities around the world.\u201d 100 passengers? Once Viceroy is up and running, REGENT plans to put into service an even bigger seaglider, called Monarch, which will have capacity for up to 100 passengers and, Thalheimer says, will enter service at the end of the decade. However, he adds, an improvement in battery technology would be required to support the hypothetical vehicles\u2019 projected range of 300 to 500 miles. According to Darren Biddlecombe, head of data at aviation consultancy firm AviationValues, REGENT\u2019s plan is possible from a technological standpoint. \u201cHowever, there are also regulatory and commercial barriers to bringing a new product to any market, and further challenges to becoming financially sustainable. Regent\u2019s ability to turn its order book into actual deliveries will depend largely on how well it can attract \u2014 and retain \u2014 the necessary capital and expertise to overcome those challenges,\u201d he says. A potentially convenient and environmentally friendly form of travel certainly looks to be an interesting prospect, Biddlecombe adds, but it will come down to REGENT\u2019s ability to produce and support the vehicles in such a way that operators can use them safely, reliably and at a cost that passengers are willing to pay. \u201cThat goes well beyond the vessels themselves to the training, infrastructure, parts and maintenance support, and regulatory approval,\u201d he says. \u201cIf REGENT can navigate those waters, they may well have a shot.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/regent-electric-seagliders-abu-dhabi-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "world"}}

In a video statement released on Tuesday, prosecutor Karim Khan said the ICC has an active investigation into possible atrocity crimes being committed at present in Darfur. \u201cI am extremely concerned about allegations of widespread international crimes being committed in al-Fashir and its surrounding areas, as we speak,\u201d Khan said, adding that his office was investigating those allegations \u201cwith urgency\u201d.

Kim\u2019s sister and government spokeswoman Kim Yo Jong warned the resumption of loudspeaker broadcasts was \u201ca prelude to a very dangerous situation.\u201d In a statement carried by North Korean state media, Kim said South Korea would be subject to an unspecified \u201cnew counteraction\u201d\u00a0from the North if it continued with the loudspeaker broadcasts and failed to prevent activists from\u00a0sending anti-North Korean propaganda leaflets over the border. \u201cI sternly warn Seoul to stop at once this dangerous act,\u201d Kim said, adding that Seoul is creating a \u201cnew environment of crisis.\u201d South\u00a0Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS)\u00a0has maintained North\u00a0Korea\u00a0is \u201cfully responsible\u201d for the current situation and urged the North to \u201cimmediately stop such mean acts like sending waste balloons.\u201d In a statement Monday, a JCS spokesman would not say whether the South would continue to broadcast over the loudspeakers, noting only that\u00a0the military would conduct missions \u201cwith flexibility according to the strategic and operational situation.\u201d The escalating tit-for-tat has sparked concerns of potential retaliatory military action. Last week, the South Korean government suspended a 2018 deal\u00a0to reduce military tensions with the North, allowing it to resume propaganda broadcasts and potentially restart military exercises along the border. South Korea\u2019s military once routinely deployed propaganda broadcasts as a means of psychological warfare against the North, until it withdrew the equipment following the 2018 deal. The broadcasts inform North\u00a0Korean soldiers and residents of the \u201creality of North\u00a0Korea,\u201d and the development of\u00a0South\u00a0Korea, and modern Korean culture, according to the JCS. Tit-for-tat balloons In recent weeks, the North has floated more than a thousand trash-filled balloons across the heavily fortified border, in what it claims is a response to the years-long practice among South Korean activist groups of sending\u00a0balloons with anti-North Korea leaflets in the other direction. As of Monday morning, the South Korean military had found \u201caround 50 balloons\u201d that fell into its territory overnight Sunday. Many other balloons are believed to have flown back into\u00a0North\u00a0Korea due to the wind, according to the JCS spokesman. On Thursday, South Korean activists sent balloons across the border toward the North, carrying hundreds of thousands of leaflets condemning leader Kim Jong Un and 5,000 USB sticks containing K-pop and K-dramas. For decades, North Korea has been almost completely closed off from the rest of the world, with tight control over what information gets in or out. Foreign materials including movies and books are banned, with only a few state-sanctioned exceptions; those caught with foreign contraband often face severe punishment, defectors say. Earlier this year a South Korean research group released rare footage that it claimed showed North Korean teenagers\u00a0sentenced to hard labor\u00a0for watching and distributing K-dramas. Restrictions softened somewhat in recent decades as North Korea\u2019s relationship with China expanded. Tentative steps to open up allowed some South Korean elements, including\u00a0parts of its pop culture,\u00a0to seep into the hermit nation \u2013 especially in 2017 and 2018, when relations thawed between the two countries. But the situation in North Korea deteriorated in the following years and diplomatic talks fell apart \u2013 prompting\u00a0strict rules to snap back\u00a0into place in the North.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/asia/north-korea-trash-balloons-south-korea-loudspeakers-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "world"}}

Daily high temperatures will surge up to 15 degrees above what\u2019s typical for June through at least Saturday and threaten dozens of daily high temperature records as sweltering heat in place over the West expands east. And the heat isn\u2019t dropping by for a quick visit, even if it ebbs in some places. There are signs it\u2019ll stick around for the long haul as a predicted hot summer kicks into gear. Parts of the West have been baking since a stifling heat dome set up over the region last week. Now, some of that heat and an additional push of hot air from Mexico will envelop more of the US as the jet stream \u2013 a river of fast-moving air in the upper atmosphere that separates warm air from cold air \u2013\u00a0slowly shifts north over the central and eastern states. The late-week warmup will be very brief for a few locations. High temperatures will surge into the 90s Wednesday in parts of the northern Plains and Upper Midwest before a cold front wipes out the heat Thursday. The heat will have staying power elsewhere. Heat will ramp up Thursday from the Plains to the East Coast, marking a considerable change from seasonably cool conditions earlier in the week. Highs in the upper 80s and 90s will be common from the Plains and Midwest to the Southeast, Ohio Valley and mid-Atlantic. Several cities will experience the warmest day of the year so far Thursday, but temperatures will be short of record levels. Humidity will build alongside the heat and make conditions feel even more uncomfortable. The thermometer has yet to climb out of the low 90s in St. Louis this year, but that will change Thursday with a high around 96 degrees. The heat index \u2013 how air feels to the human body \u2013 could approach triple digits. Temperatures will warm even more Friday for much of the Gulf Coast, Southeast and mid-Atlantic as hot air surges north. Highs well into the 90s will stretch from Texas through Georgia and the Carolinas north into parts of Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Friday will be the hottest day of the year so far in Washington, DC. The high temperature could approach the mid-90s, which is about 10 degrees higher than normal. Heat will be at its worst by Saturday for much of the Gulf Coast and Southeast but ease slightly for areas farther north with the passage of a cold front. Atlanta is expected to top out near 99 degrees on Saturday, which would be a temperature record for the date and the hottest reading of the year so far. If the city were to hit 100 degrees it would be the first triple-digit temperature there since August 2019. Highs in the upper 90s and low 100s could also break Saturday\u2019s high temperature records in multiple other Southeast cities including: Birmingham and Montgomery, Alabama, and New Orleans and Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Expansive heat will build once again for much of the central and eastern US on Sunday as the jet stream settles near the US-Canada border and high pressure builds in the upper atmosphere.

{"id": "2024_06_10_middleeast_iran-presidential-election-candidates-announced-intl", "text": "The Iranian election committee has approved a slate of mostly hardline candidates to run in the presidential election on June 28, following the helicopter crash that killed President Ebrahim Raisi and other officials last month. Out of 80 initial candidates, only six individuals were approved in a vetting process by Iran\u2019s Guardian Council, a powerful 12-member body charged with overseeing elections and legislation. There were four women on the longer list and none was approved. The slate includes hardline parliament speaker and former Revolutionary Guards commander Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf and Saeed Jalili, ex-chief nuclear negotiator and former head of the Supreme National Security Council, Iran\u2019s top security body. Competition is expected to be fierce between Qalibaf and Jalili, both of whom backed Raisi in the 2021 presidential election. \u201c(Qalibaf) and Jalili are on competing conservative poles and are unlikely to withdraw in favor of the other,\u201d wrote Sina Toossi, a DC-based Iran analyst and senior fellow at the Center for International Policy, in a post on X. The list also includes Amir Hossein Ghazizadeh Hashemi, Alireza Zakani, and Mostafa Pour Mohammad, all of whom are also hardliners. The Guardian Council has, however, also approved Masoud Pezeshkian, a reformist lawmaker who served as parliament deputy speaker from 2016 to 2020. Pezeshkian is expected to have a slim chance in the race. On Sunday, reformist newspaper Shargh Daily posted a photo of the six candidates with the caption, \u201cOne against five.\u201d During the Mahsa Amini protests in September 2022, Pezeshkian said in an interview, \u201cIt is our fault. We want to implement religious faith through the use of force. This is scientifically impossible.\u201d However, \u201cif the conservative vote is split, Pezeshkian could secure over 50% of the vote and win in the first round,\u201d said Toossi, adding that the outcome nonetheless \u201chinges on the turnout of the traditional reformist base, which has boycotted the past several elections.\u201d Notably absent from the list of approved candidates are two-term president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and former parliament speaker Ali Larijani. Both men were also previously disbarred by the Guardian Council. Raisi\u2019s death and the nearing vote come at a delicate time for a country facing unprecedented challenges at home and from abroad. The Islamic Republic\u2019s economy remains crippled by American sanctions, its young population is becoming growingly restive, and the nation faces increasingly belligerent adversaries in the Middle East and beyond. The June 28 poll\u00a0also comes amid dwindling trust in the establishment, leading to plummeting electoral turnouts in a country that has traditionally boasted exceptionally high voter participation.

The ruling comes just days before the US Olympic swimming trials, which begin Saturday. CNN has reached out to Thomas\u2019 attorney\u00a0for the swimmer\u2019s comment. Thomas, 25, had in January filed legal paperwork against World Aquatics, swimming\u2019s governing body based in Switzerland, for its policy that restricts transgender athletes from competing in most elite women\u2019s aquatics competitions. The policy dictates male-to-female transgender athletes would only be eligible to compete in the women\u2019s categories if they transition before the age of 12 or before they reach stage 2 of the puberty Tanner Stages. World Aquatics officials said in a statement the decision this week is \u201ca major step forward in our efforts to protect women\u2019s sport.\u201d \u201cWorld Aquatics is dedicated to fostering an environment that promotes fairness, respect, and equal opportunities for athletes of all genders and we reaffirm this pledge,\u201d officials said. \u201cOur policies and practices are continuously evaluated to ensure they align with these core values, which led to the introduction of our open category.\u201d The three-member Court of Arbitration for Sport panel found Thomas was not eligible \u201cfor the time being\u201d to participate in World Aquatics competitions and only eligible for USA Swimming events that do not qualify as elite events. It also said national federations don\u2019t have the authority to modify the application of a world governing body\u2019s rules. As a swimmer on the women\u2019s team at the University of Pennsylvania, Thomas became\u00a0the first transgender athlete\u00a0to win an NCAA Division I title after winning the women\u2019s 500-yard freestyle event in March 2022. The NCAA championships fall outside the purview of World Aquatics. A few months later World Aquatics ratified its updated gender policy, which went into effect in March 2023, according to the 24-page arbitral award. It created an\u00a0open category\u00a0for\u00a0transgender\u00a0athletes at a World Cup event in Berlin in October for \u201call sex and gender identities.\u201d World Aquatics oversees competitions in swimming, artistic swimming, open water swimming, water polo, diving and high diving. USA Swimming is the national governing body for swimmers and a member of World Aquatics. The ruling comes just before the US Olympic swimming trials, which begin Saturday.

He was 86. The Clippers said West passed away Wednesday morning with his wife Karen by his side. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement on Wednesday: \u201cJerry West was a basketball genius and a defining figure in our league for more than 60 years.\u00a0He distinguished himself not only as an NBA champion and an All-Star in all 14 of his playing seasons, but also as a consummate competitor who embraced the biggest moments. \u201cHe helped build eight championship teams during his tenure in the NBA \u2013 a legacy of achievement that mirrors his on-court excellence.\u00a0And he will be enshrined this October into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame as a contributor, becoming the first person ever inducted as both a player and a contributor,\u201d Silver continued. \u201cOn behalf of the NBA, we send our deepest condolences to Jerry\u2019s wife, Karen, his family and his many friends in the NBA community.\u201d West \u2013 known on the court as \u201cMr. Clutch\u201d \u2013 was drafted by the then-named Minneapolis Lakers in 1960, shortly before the franchise relocated to Los Angeles. He played for the team as a point guard and shooting guard until 1974, and during this time he became a 14-time NBA All-Star and helped lead his team to the NBA Finals nine times. West was also a co-captain of the US Olympic basketball team that went on to win the gold in 1960. After his playing career, he coached the Lakers for three seasons beginning in 1976 before becoming a scout and then joining the front office of the franchise. During his time in leadership for the Lakers, West helped rebuild the team, first during the \u201cShowtime\u201d Lakers era of the 1980s with Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and James Worthy among others, before rebuilding the team in the mid-1990s with Shaquille O\u2019Neal and Kobe Bryant. He later took on leadership roles with the Memphis Grizzlies, Golden State Warriors and the Clippers. He was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2019 by then-President Donald Trump. \u201cI am so deeply saddened at the news of Jerry\u2019s passing,\u201d Chicago Bulls legend Michael Jordan said, via his representative. \u201cHe was truly a friend and a mentor. Like an older brother to me. \u201cI valued his friendship and knowledge. I always wished I could\u2019ve played against him as a competitor, but the more I came to know him, I wish I had been his teammate. \u201cI admired his basketball insights, and he and I shared many similarities to how we approached the game. He will be forever missed. My condolences to his wife Karen and his sons. Rest in peace, Logo.\u201d Johnson, who played for the Lakers for 13 seasons, posted to X Wednesday afternoon, \u201cToday is a sad day for basketball fans.\u201d \u201cJerry West was more than a general manager, he was a great friend and confidante. He was there in my highest moments, winning five NBA Championships, and in my lowest moment when I announced my HIV diagnosis and we cried together for hours in his office,\u201d Johnson wrote. \u201cBeyond his basketball accolades as a basketball player and NBA executive, Jerry West was a great man, a leader of men, fiercely loved his family and friends, and despite holding jobs with other franchises, he was a Lakers fan for life,\u201d he added. \u201cLaker Nation, the only reason we have 17 NBA championships is because of Jerry West and his expertise drafting players, trading for players, and hiring the right coaches.\u201d West\u2019s former teammate and colleague Pat Riley also shared his condolences: \u201cI loved Jerry West! We loved being Lakers together; it was sacred ground. We grew in life with each other and shared the best and worst of times together,\u201d Riley said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cWe can only hope there is someone we meet during a crucial time in our lives that will change you in ways you could dream about. Jerry was that person for me.\u201d \u201cJerry kicked down that coaching door for me and said, you can do this, but it has to be now. He knew, then he let me coach. I thank him forever and always for giving me that opportunity,\u201d he continued, calling West \u201csmart, committed, opinionated, fearless, generous, ultra-competitive, (and) stubborn, but with great grace.\u201d \u2018The Logo\u2019 One of the most famous players in the history of the league, a silhouette of West\u00a0during a Lakers game was famously the inspiration for the NBA\u2019s logo, leading to his other nickname \u201cThe Logo.\u201d In 1969, the NBA commissioned a new logo for the league from designer Alan Siegel, who had famously overseen the design of Major League Baseball\u2019s logo. Siegel, a fan of West, found his inspiration in a photograph of the Lakers guard\u2019s perfect dribbling form. \u201cIt\u2019s the easiest job I ever had,\u201d Siegel told CNN Sport. Siegel has no problem admitting that the NBA logo is based on West, but it\u2019s a different story when it comes to the NBA itself. The league has never formally acknowledged that the logo depicts West and did not respond to requests for comment. But in the NBA\u2019s defense, Siegel confesses that he never told anyone at the NBA that the logo was modeled after West and never intended for it to be recognizable as the 1972 NBA champion. West\u2019s influence on basketball for a long stretch of time was far-reaching, with broadcaster Stephen A. Smith saying: \u201cHe was relevant to the game of basketball literally from the \u201960s until he passed away in his sleep last night.\u201d Clippers owner Steve Ballmer called West a \u201cconfidant, an advisor and a friend.\u201d \u201cConnie, my wife, called him my \u2018basketball dad.\u2019 He was absolutely my basketball sage: wise, loyal and so much fun,\u201d Ballmer said in a statement. \u201cIf you were in his presence, you felt his competitiveness and his drive. He cared about everything and everyone. From the first day I met Jerry seven years ago, he inspired me with his intellect, honesty and enthusiasm. He never stopped. I spent a lot of time with him, some of the best times of my life. He always lent an ear, and he always had a quip. He always left me laughing. I will miss him.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/sport/jerry-west-lakers-legend-dies-intl-spt/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "world"}}

Amnesty\u00a0has contacted several global partners about its findings, including the office of the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, urging it to investigate\u00a0\u201ccrimes under international law committed by all parties during the conflict in north-east Nigeria.\u201d Amnesty\u00a0researchers say they spoke to nearly 50 girls and young women who escaped Boko Haram\u00a0and found their way to government-held territory, risking their lives\u00a0and those of their children\u00a0in the process. However, their horrific experiences at the hands of their captors were further compounded by the hardship they faced once they regained their freedom. \u00a0\u201cThese girls, many of whom are now young women, had their childhood stolen from them and suffered a litany of war crimes and other human rights abuses. They are now showing remarkable bravery as they seek to take control of their future,\u201d said Samira Daoud, Amnesty\u00a0International\u2019s regional director for West and Central Africa. \u2018Wives of Boko Haram\u2019 Among the 126, the Amnesty\u00a0team spoke to 31 girls and young women who described being unlawfully imprisoned in military custody between 2015 and mid-2023 for periods ranging from a few days to over four years, accused of having allegiances with Boko Haram. They described being humiliated by soldiers who called them \u201cwives of Boko Haram\u201d and accused them of being behind killings carried out by the terror group. Several told Amnesty\u00a0researchers of enduring beatings while detained by the military. One of them, named NV in the report, said she fled Boko Haram in 2021 when she was around 20. She said she was held for two months in Madagali, Adamawa State, by soldiers. NV said: \u201cWhen they [soldiers] brought food\u2026 they gave us a portion in our hand and soup in one bowl for all of us to share\u2026 As a toilet, they gave us a plastic bag.\u201d Another, called GN in the report, said Nigerian soldiers detained her after they raided the camp where she and others were held by Boko Haram, before being taken to an internally displaced persons (IDP) camp.\u00a0She had been forcibly married to a Boko Haram fighter while in captivity but remarried while living in the IDP for an extended period. She\u00a0later\u00a0received a call from her Boko Haram \u201chusband\u201d asking her to come back to him, which aroused suspicion from a neighbor who reported her to security forces, GN said. \u201cNigerian soldiers detained her in Bama Prison for around one month in the second half of 2021 and beat her with a cane for three days. She was pregnant at the time. The soldiers blindfolded her and transferred her to Giwa Barracks in Maiduguri. GN was unlawfully detained there for around one year, during which she gave birth,\u201d the report stated. By the time she regained her freedom, her Boko Haram \u201chusband\u201d had sued her and her new husband in sharia (Islamic) court and they were ordered to pay him money, it added. Amnesty\u00a0International said it had communicated its findings to Nigerian federal and state authorities. In response, the Nigerian Defense Headquarters in a statement sent to CNN Monday said the Armed Forces of Nigeria AFN \u201cmakes it unequivocally clear that, it is a professional military force that operates within the ambit of International law of armed conflict.\u201d Adding that it would encourage Amnesty \u201cto approach the military high command to substantiate their allegations. The military has self regulating mechanisms with which it administers the military justice system to address any proven case of misconduct of personnel.\u201d CNN has contacted the\u00a0Nigerian Army and the Borno State authorities for comment on the allegations. The\u00a0Borno State government, under an initiative to reintegrate fleeing and surrendered Boko Haram fighters, gave reassurances that they would not be prosecuted but allowed to stay with their families, including their wives, according to the report. \u201cBorno State Governor Babagana Zulum promised that Boko Haram fighters would not be handed over to the military and would be provided with services and allowed to stay with their families, including their \u2018wives,\u2019\u201d the report said. When Amnesty asked girls and young women about the screening process conducted by the military or government authorities after they had exited Boko Haram, \u201cnone of the interviewees said they were asked whether they had married or joined Boko Haram freely.\u201d This failure to attempt to identify victims of forced marriage or trafficking makes it even harder for the women and girls to access the support they are entitled to, the report said. A decade-long reign of terror Since 2009, the armed Islamist group\u00a0Boko Haram\u00a0has waged an insurgency estimated to have killed more than 35,000 people and displaced two million people in the country\u2019s northeast, according to the UN. During a reign of terror that spanned more than a decade, Boko Haram launched attacks on families in the northeast of Nigeria, with tactics including\u00a0\u201csuicide bombings, abductions, torture, rape, forced marriages, and recruitment of child soldiers,\u201d according to the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect. One of Boko Haram\u2019s most notorious abductions was the kidnapping of the Chibok schoolgirls in 2014, when nearly 300 students were taken from their school in Chibok, Borno State. This event prompted global outrage and spotlighted the insurgent group\u2019s brutal tactics. Since the Chibok abductions, many more girls have been abducted; most of them were forced into marriage. According to the report, Boko Haram engages in child and forced marriage. The interviewees described harsh treatment and public punishments and at least 31 girls told Amnesty\u00a0researchers they were forced to witness lashings, amputations, and beheadings. One girl referred to as GH in the report, was held captive for about 10 years. She recounted often being forced to watch violent punishments.\u00a0\u201cSometimes I dream about the corpses that I saw or the stoning of the women that I saw. Once I open my eyes, I can\u2019t go back to sleep again,\u201d she\u00a0said in the report. Many\u00a0survivors of Boko Haram\u00a0told Amnesty\u00a0that they witnessed Boko Haram killing their relatives. One\u00a0young woman, named as\u00a0CB\u00a0in the report,\u00a0said she was abducted at around\u00a0age\u00a013 in 2014. \u201cOne day, Boko Haram \u2026 came into our house. They told our father we were non-believers. They shot my father in the back of his head, and the bullet came through his eyes. We started crying. They said if we\u00a0don\u2019t\u00a0keep quiet, they\u00a0will\u00a0kill my mother too,\u201d she told researchers. Kidnapped girls were also forced into sexual slavery and domestic servitude as \u201cwives,\u201d with at least 33 survivors telling Amnesty\u00a0they were raped by the men they were forced to marry. One teenager, named as HA in the Amnesty\u00a0report, said she agreed\u00a0to get married to a Boko Haram militant to save her father\u2019s life. She added that she was frequently raped and beaten\u00a0during the \u201cmarriage,\u201d with other Boko Haram fighters helping her husband as he forced himself on her. Consequently, many of the girls and young women face long-term issues relating to their health,\u00a0have had\u00a0limited access to education, and\u00a0suffer\u00a0stigma from their loved ones and their community. Amnesty\u00a0says the women and girls are speaking out to seek urgent help and support. \u201cThese survivors are overlooked and abandoned. This needs to change \u2026 on their terms and with their active and meaningful participation. Their message must no longer be ignored: \u201cHelp us rebuild our lives.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/africa/boko-haram-nigerian-girls-neglected-amnesty-says-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "world"}}

Now we are very vigilant, he will receive all the consular protections that apply in such a case. I want to say the truth in the face of the brainwashing that we hear,\u201d Macron said. Russia\u2019s Investigative Committee said earlier on Thursday that a French citizen, employed by the non-profit Swiss Center for Humanitarian Dialogue, was detained on suspicion of \u201ccollecting information in the field of military activities of the Russian Federation.\u201d Video released by the Investigative Committee showed the man being arrested by security personnel\u00a0at\u00a0a cafe in Moscow and escorted\u00a0into a military van. The Investigative Committee alleges the French national had\u00a0been gathering information on Russia\u2019s \u201cmilitary and military-technical activities\u201d for several years and didn\u2019t register as a foreign agent. \u201cFor these purposes, he repeatedly visited the territory of Russia, including the city of Moscow, where he held meetings with citizens of the Russian Federation,\u201d the Investigative Committee said. An Investigative Committee official told Russian state news agency TASS that the man worked as a consultant at the non-profit handling Eurasian issues after the February 2014 events in Ukraine, including the mass pro-democracy protests that swept Kyiv and the exit of the pro-Russian, former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich. CNN has reached out to the French Foreign Ministry and the Swiss Center for Humanitarian Dialogue for comment. Relations between both countries became strained when Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine more than two years ago. Several Westerners have found themselves detained in the country amid the rising tensions. US-Russian journalist Alsu\u00a0Kurmasheva was detained last year in the Russian city of Kazan while waiting for a return flight to the Czech Republic, where she was based. She had arrived in Russia in May due to an urgent family matter, according to her employer the US-funded Radio Free Europe/ Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), and was accused of refusing to register as a foreign agent. Russia expanded its law on \u201cforeign agents\u201d in 2022, signaling an intensifying crackdown on free speech and opposition under Putin.

{"id": "2024_06_10_middleeast_inside-israels-hostage-rescue-intl-dst", "text": "Three days after an Israeli military operation rescued four hostages being held by Hamas in Nuseirat refugee camp, central Gaza, killing more than 270 Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials, new details are still emerging about what was one of the most dramatic and deadly events since the war started. The daytime rescue operation, which took weeks of planning, caught militants holding hostages in two different buildings in a densely packed civilian area off guard. It appeared to have been carried out by Israeli forces using non-military vehicles, including a white Mercedes van, according to eyewitnesses, whose accounts tallied with videos analyzed by CNN. Eyewitnesses also said that they saw Israeli forces in disguise \u2013 dressed as Hamas fighters or civilians. \u201cThey were dressed in military uniforms like resistance fighters, carrying helmets and wearing signs of the [Hamas] resistance, giving the impression to people that they were resistance fighters, but in reality, they were an Israeli special forces unit,\u201d Khalil Al Tirawi, a local resident, told CNN. The Israeli military denied using civilian vehicles, but declined to say whether the officers conducting the rescue were disguised as militants or dressed as Palestinian civilians. The Israeli military had previously used civilian clothing as a tactic in its operations. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the units on the ground were given the \u201cgo\u201d at 11 a.m. local time and, by 11:25 a.m., began the raids simultaneously on both buildings where militants were holding the hostages \u2014 Noa Argamani, Almog Meir Jan, Andrey Kozlov and Shlomi Ziv, all of whom were taken on October 7 from the Nova music festival in Hamas\u2019 deadly cross-border terror attack. The Israeli soldiers managed to reach the apartment where guards were holding Argamani \u2014 pictured in a viral video being driven to Gaza on the back of a motorbike \u2013 undetected. \u201cIn Noa Argamani\u2019s building, we surprised them completely,\u201d Adm. Daniel Hagari, an IDF spokesman, said. But soon after the mission got underway, Israeli soldiers and militants began to exchange fire, according to eyewitness accounts and statements from the Israeli military. Eyewitnesses said that heavy bombardment followed, with missiles and rockets raining down on the densely packed camp, home to thousands of displaced families. A 45-second edited helmet camera video released Monday by the Israeli police and the Israeli Security Agency showed the moment the three male hostages were rescued. Heavy gunfire could be heard throughout the video, intensifying after the hostages left the building, and two soldiers were seen wearing uniforms. By the time that the hostages, referred to by the code name \u201cdiamonds,\u201d\u00a0were brought to the Mediterranean coast and successfully evacuated in two helicopters, the operation had left a deadly trail of destruction in its wake. The latest figures from Gazan authorities say 274 Palestinians were killed and 698 injured \u2013 which would mark one of the deadliest days in months for people living in Gaza. The IDF has disputed those numbers, saying it estimated the number of casualties from the operation was \u201cunder 100.\u201d CNN cannot independently verify either side\u2019s figures. Gaza\u2019s health ministry does not distinguish between civilians and militants. \u2018We felt like it was the apocalypse\u2019 The IDF said that two teams from an Israeli police counter-terrorism special forces unit were sent into the two apartment buildings in the camp to retrieve the hostages simultaneously out of concern that if Hamas realized\u00a0there was a rescue operation ongoing in one building, they might kill the hostages in the other. As Argamani was extracted by Israeli forces, in the other apartment 200 meters away, where the three male hostages were being held, a gunfight broke out, according to the IDF. The IDF said a counter-terrorism special forces squad commander in the Yamam (National Police Counter-Terrorism Unit), Arnon Zamora,\u00a0was fatally wounded in that gunfight. Al Tirawi and another man, both of\u00a0whom are living across from where part of the rescue operation took place, in the center of Nuseirat refugee camp, said that they saw Israeli soldiers arrive in civilian cars in disguise. Abdullah Jouda, who was displaced from Jabalia to Nuseirat camp during the war, told CNN that he heard noises on the street around 11:30 a.m. and went to see what was happening. When he opened the door, he said he saw\u00a0men, who he believes were Israeli forces, leaving a Mercedes van dressed in all black and wearing the emblem for Hamas\u2019 military wing Al Qassam Brigades. \u201cI saw special forces, as soon as they left the vehicle, they had ladders on the balcony and [were] climbing them \u2026 I only saw them for approximately two seconds because if I looked at them longer, I could have been killed,\u201d Jouda said. \u201cThere was heavy gunfire \u2026 almost everything was being fired on. Warplanes were firing, drones were firing, sound grenades. It was terrifying, we felt like it was the apocalypse.\u201d CNN could not independently verify his claims, but a\u00a0video showed a white Mercedes van, with mattresses, plastic bags and other objects strapped to its roof \u2013 a frequent sight in the camp, where many people have sought shelter from the war, their belongings in tow \u2013\u00a0was parked on a street where the operation unfolded. Two ladders could be seen leaning up against a multistorey building next to the van, reaching up to a higher floor. A body appears to be visible on the ground in front of the truck. \u201cThere they are. They are still there!\u201d a woman filming the 6 second clip can be heard saying. The video of the hostage rescue shared by Israeli police and the Israeli Security Agency was geolocated to the same location by CNN. The IDF said its forces came under heavy fire from militants, including with rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs), and that it responded with strikes to support the team on the ground as the extraction efforts continued. \u201cThey were firing RPGs and firing at our forces \u2026 the cynical way that Hamas is using the population to fire at our forces, embedding themselves in the civilians is tragic,\u201d Hagari said, adding that there was \u201cso much fire was on our forces, we needed to fire from the air and from the street.\u201d In one video shared with CNN by local journalist Fadi Thabet, two US-made air-to-ground hellfire missiles can be seen flying in different directions at 11:28 a.m., according to its metadata. One appears to hit the opposite side of the building where the white Mercedes van was parked outside, while the other impacts another building nearby. Footage from the aftermath of the strike shows both the van and building destroyed. Two explosive weapons experts, Trevor Ball, a former US army explosive ordnance disposal technician, and Richard Weir, senior crisis and conflict researcher at Human Rights Watch, confirmed the munitions. The intense aerial bombardment destroyed apartment buildings and vehicles throughout Nuseirat camp, according to witnesses and video footage. \u201cGunfire was coming from multiple sources, but we couldn\u2019t witness everything as anyone who tried to look would be at risk of being killed,\u201d Al Tirawi said.\u00a0\u201cIt is beyond imagination \u2013 a barrage of heavy gunfire, artillery missiles, rockets.\u201d Another local resident, Nidal Abdo, was buying groceries at the market in Nuseirat when he said the strikes intensified.\u00a0\u201cMaybe 150 rockets fell in less than 10 minutes, while we were running away more fell on the market,\u201d he said, adding that he had never witnessed anything like it in Gaza before.\u00a0\u201cThey wiped out Nuseirat, it is hell on earth.\u201d \u2018The diamonds have taken off\u2019 In another video from Al Jazeera, verified by CNN, a truck emblazoned with a brand of dishwashing soap, resembling a vehicle commonly used to bring aid in Gaza, could be seen traveling on a road accompanied by a tank and Israeli armored vehicles about a mile from the refugee camp. The vehicles headed away from the camp and in the direction of an area near the US military\u2019s floating pier on the Mediterranean coast, where the extraction took place. CNN was not able to verify the time the video was filmed, so could not determine whether it took place before or after the raid. The Israeli military denied using the US-built pier in the operation. A senior Biden administration official tells CNN that Israeli forces did not use an aid truck in the operation. As for the use of the US pier, the official said: \u201cThey landed close to the pier but not on it.\u201d The IDF said two helicopters were used to evacuate the hostages, one of which they later shared footage of. The first helicopter evacuated Argamani and the second transported the three male hostages along with the then-wounded, Zamora, who later died in hospital. A video geolocated by CNN shows a helicopter taking off from the beach in Gaza, close to the US floating pier. The IDF released a video on Sunday capturing the moment that military officials first heard that the three male hostages had also been successfully rescued. In it,\u00a0Maj. Gen. Yaron Finkelman, who commands the Southern Command of the IDF, can be heard saying, \u201cThe three diamonds have just taken off to the landing towards the country.\u201d The IDF said it got intelligence on the location of the hostages through different avenues, including from the United States. A US official told CNN that an American cell in Israel supported the efforts to rescue four Israeli hostages, working with Israeli forces on the operation, referring to a team that\u2019s been in place supporting Israel since October 7 with information gathering about the hostages. \u201cThere were no US forces, no US boots on the ground involved in this operation,\u201d national security adviser Jake Sullivan told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash on \u201cState of the Union.\u201d Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office said that the prime minister had approved the rescue operation last Thursday and was present in the command room during the operation. Preparations for the raid began weeks ago and hundreds of personnel from the Israeli military, domestic intelligence service and police special unit were involved, Hagari said, adding that they opted to carry it out during the day to afford them a greater element of surprise. As part of their preparations, the military built models of the apartments the hostages were held in after receiving intelligence regarding their location Hagari told journalists Saturday that similar raids had been called off at the last minute \u201cmore than three or four times\u201d due to unfavorable conditions for Israeli special forces. He did not specify whether those operations concerned the same four hostages or others held in Gaza. Most of the other hostages are not being held in conditions that would allow for similar operations, he said. Hostages being held in Gaza are frequently moved to different locations, Hagari said, adding that Argamani had previously been held elsewhere. After their evacuation, the hostages were then flown to Sheba Medical Center in Ramat Gan, near Tel Aviv. Argamani was later transferred to Ichilov Hospital in Tel Aviv to be treated alongside her mother who has late-stage brain cancer.

{"id": "2024_06_12_style_drake-oversized-pants", "text": "Over the weekend, Drake posted an outfit to Instagram that has since generated a lot of chatter online. Dressed in a pair of billowing stone-gray slacks, a cream T-shirt and a white sweater tossed and tied over his shoulders, the singer and rapper was pictured on the sidelines of his son\u2019s soccer match. And the elevated ensemble put the padre in Champagne Papi. He had clearly taken a spaghetti-stained leaf out of Tony Soprano\u2019s style book, argued one half of social media, and was emanating suave, sharp mobster energy. Others were harder to convince, taking issue either with the preppy tailoring (several people on X likened his structured silhouette to that of Katherine Hepburn) or the voluminous cut of his pants. New York Magazine\u2019s The Cut dutifully collected reactions from a range of fashion stylists, and even industry experts were divided. \u201cThe silhouette is perfect,\u201d chimed one. Another dissented: \u201cIt\u2019s styled like cosplay. It\u2019s too much of a concept and looks forced.\u201d Everyone could agree on one thing, however: This was a sartorial gear shift for the 37-year-old artist, who is more often seen in puffer coats, sports jerseys, hoodies or Letterman jackets. Fans flooded the comments, calling him a \u201csoccer dad\u201d or \u201csoccer papi.\u201d \u201cNext level dad duties fit,\u201d read one comment, now liked by almost 40,000 people. Was Drake channeling the look of a 1950\u2019s father? The elevated ensemble had, an undeniableair of old Hollywood stardom to it. Drake looked like an off-duty Cary Grant, or one of the debonair salesmen from \u201cMad Men,\u201d oozing the kind of traditional masculinity that has since been upended by a proliferation of skinny jeans and sweatpants. \u201cThe look gives \u2018good dad,\u2019\u201d one fashion stylist told The Cut. The fathers of yesteryear, with their dapper tailored trousers and argyle polo shirts, have been somewhat mythologized in collective consciousness. During the \u201850s and \u201860s, the nuclear family unit was considered the fundamental basis for a functional, healthy society \u2014\u00a0with fathers at the center. In April and May, a series of brutal diss tracks were issued between Drake and US rapper Kendrick Lamar. As the lyrical sparring continued, things got personal. In the 6 and a half minute song, \u201cMeet the Grahams,\u201d Lamar called Drake a \u201cdeadbeat\u201d dad, even suggesting he has fathered a secret, second child. Drake\u2019s response \u2014 a track called \u201cFamily Matters\u201d\u00a0\u2014 was swift and unwavering in its denial. Now the dust has settled, Drake\u2019s latest rebuttal transcends tit for tat rapping into something more visual. \u201cGoats don\u2019t worry about one trick ponies,\u201d he captioned the post. If Lamar\u2019s fighting words caused any doubt over Drake\u2019s parenting abilities, here he was, for all to see, spending an afternoon cheering on his child \u2014 dressed as the all-American family man.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/style/drake-oversized-pants/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_31_europe_far-right-european-election-intl", "text": "This is a historic and pivotal year for democracy across the globe. Around\u00a070 countries\u00a0\u2013 from the\u00a0United States\u00a0to\u00a0South Africa, via\u00a0Mexico\u00a0and\u00a0Taiwan\u00a0\u2013 will hold elections in 2024. After India\u2019s huge and ongoing six-week ballot, however, the biggest election in terms of voter numbers takes place this week, when 373 million Europeans can go to the polls and elect 720 members of the next European Parliament. Once the votes have been tallied from across the 27-nation bloc, it is widely expected that the results will show a significant shift to the right, which could have major implications for the political direction of the European Union at a time\u00a0when it is battling\u00a0multiple crises,\u00a0many of them global. From the war in Ukraine to coping with mass migration, the rise of China to the threat of climate change, it\u2019s hard to see how a bloc of\u00a0diverse\u00a0countries could possibly speak with one voice. Of course, differences in opinion among\u00a0the\u00a0member states is nothing new. EU politics has always relied on awkward alliances between countries and political ideologies that represent vastly different electorates. The EU\u2019s political center has undeniably moved to the right over the past two decades,\u00a0however. The European Parliament is the place where this is most visible at an EU level. Most\u00a0of the lawmakers (known as MEPs)\u00a0belong to a political party in their own country.\u00a0Once they enter\u00a0the European Parliament\u00a0in the Belgian capital of Brussels, they sit in loose, multinational political groupings that broadly have similar political interests. These groupings then form even looser coalitions,\u00a0which\u00a0usually results with a majority grouping of centrists from the center-left, center-right and liberals somewhere in the middle. The rightward shift of the political center in this coalition has been gradual. In 1994, the main socialist group S&D had the most MEPs. In 1999,\u00a0it was\u00a0overtaken by the center-right European People\u2019s Party (EPP). The EPP, best explained as conservatives in the mold of former German Chancellor Angela Merkel,\u00a0has\u00a0been the dominant force in\u00a0EU\u00a0politics ever since. While the EPP has been able to lead a mainstream centrist coalition with the left and liberals at a European level, MEPs are still beholden to domestic politics happening back in their own countries. For example, it\u2019s not easy for a conservative to work with a liberal on a pan-EU policy that would share the burden of asylum seekers if voters back home are becoming attracted to loud, anti-immigration populists. The louder the domestic noise \u2013 and the greater the risk of losing their own seat in parliament \u2013 the trickier cross-party politics at a Brussels level becomes. The anticipated influx of\u00a0lawmakers into groups\u00a0to the EPP\u2019s right will\u00a0certainly\u00a0complicate matters. While the\u00a0right-wing\u00a0European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) and\u00a0far-right\u00a0Identity and Democracy (ID)\u00a0groups\u00a0are expected to finish fourth and fifth respectively in terms of seat numbers, their combined tally, which could be upwards of 140,\u00a0according to the Politico Poll of Polls, will be hard for the EPP to ignore.\u00a0The EPP is currently predicted to win 165 seats to 143 for the socialist S&D. ECR and ID are typical of European\u00a0Parliament\u00a0parties in that they are home to a pretty broad group of conservatives. The ECR, for example, was founded by former British Prime Minister David Cameron who campaigned against Brexit. Its current chair is Italian PM Giorgia Meloni, who garnered lots of attention during the 2022 Italian election for her opposition to\u00a0LGBTQ+\u00a0rights,\u00a0promises to curb migration and general anti-globalist rhetoric. However, since\u00a0Meloni\u2019s\u00a0election, she has been seen as considerably more moderate and has supported many key EU initiatives, including support for Ukraine. She has also resisted allowing\u00a0authoritarian\u00a0Hungarian\u00a0leader\u00a0Viktor Orban to join the ECR after he left the EPP. Hungary has been the most pro-Russia EU voice since the start of the war. Whether or not it was deliberate on Meloni\u2019s part, resistance to Orban has made working with her and the ECR more palatable to the Brussels establishment, including EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. ID, too, has sought to moderate its image. It\u00a0recently expelled\u00a0the German far-right AfD party from its ranks after one of its most senior MEPs told an Italian newspaper\u00a0that he didn\u2019t see all members of the SS, the notorious Nazi paramilitary group, automatically as criminals. There is quite a wide range in opinion from the moderate wing of the ERC to the fringes of ID, but political\u00a0currents\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0desire for influence\u00a0can result in some\u00a0odd bedfellows, especially in the opaque and fluid world of European politics. It is unlikely that the EPP would be willing to work directly with ID any time soon, but that doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t be important. History has shown us repeatedly that it\u2019s possible to influence policy from outside the tent. Suppose\u00a0that\u00a0parties associated with ID start putting center-right\u00a0politicians\u00a0under pressure in their own countries. You might find the center adopts their policy ideas \u2013\u00a0as has previously happened in France, the\u00a0United Kingdom\u00a0and Germany. And there are\u00a0more than\u00a0enough hot topics in Europe now for the right to get its teeth stuck into. Migration, climate change, border security, military spending, rule of law \u2013 all of these have been flashpoints in pan-Europe politics for a long time and are not going away any time soon. And it is ultimately the newly-elected Parliament that vets and approves the\u00a0make-up\u00a0of the\u00a0European\u00a0Commission \u2013 the EU\u2019s executive body. It\u2019s worth noting that support for Ukraine is expected to be safe\u00a0for the time being, with the pro-Kremlin\u00a0groups appearing\u00a0very\u00a0isolated. But almost everything else will be handled on a case-by-case basis if the numbers work out that way. And the more MEPs elected that are to the right of the EPP, the more their influence could grow over time. Five years is a long time in politics, and that is how long this Parliament will last. In that time, France will hold an election that Marine Le Pen, who is affiliated with ID, might win\u00a0with her National Rally party. Geert Wilders, also ID, is soon expected to form a government in the Netherlands after emerging as the biggest party in their\u00a0November\u00a0elections. In other words, the domestic politics in member states could shift even further to the right, which naturally changes calculations in Brussels. The European Parliament\u00a0can often seem like\u00a0looks\u00a0like a boring, bureaucratic blob, tediously grinding its way through process. But the EU is an increasingly geopolitical player \u2013 able to impose sanctions on Russian and Chinese political figures, provide funds to Ukraine and use its economic heft as the world\u2019s largest trading bloc in diplomacy. If its political center is indeed shifting to the right, its influence will inevitably have\u00a0meaningful\u00a0and\u00a0perhaps far-reaching\u00a0consequences for people\u00a0living beyond Europe\u2019s\u00a0borders.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/europe/far-right-european-election-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_style_fumihiko-maki-architect-dies", "text": "Tokyo (AP) \u2014 Japanese architect Fumihiko Maki, who won the prestigious Pritzker Prize for designs praised as smartly and artfully fusing the East with the West, has died. He was 95. Maki, who taught architecture and urban design at Harvard, died June 6, his office, Maki & Associates, said Wednesday. Japanese media reports attributed the cause of death to old age. The office declined to confirm the reports. The National Museum of Modern Art in Kyoto is considered one of his classic designs, with floating forms of glass, metal and concrete. Its gray exterior appears simple at first glance but sets off patterns of reflected light on rough and polished marble. In the U.S., Maki\u2019s projects included the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco and 4 World Trade Center in New York. He also did the Makuhari Messe exhibition hall in Chiba, Japan, and the Hillside Terrace Complex in Tokyo. Maki in the 1980s designed Tokyo\u2019s Spiral building, whose management mourned his death and thanked him for \u201cthe beautiful slopes and the rich space that envisioned an urban park.\u201d In 2013, Maki\u00a0complained about the then planned spaceship-like design\u00a0of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics stadium, slamming it as too expensive and clashing with its surroundings. He said he had the support 100 other people, including architects, in opposing the size of the proposed design by British-Iraqi architect Zaha Hadid. \u201cThe problems I see with the planned stadium all relate to the issue of scale,\u201d he said.That design was eventually ditched for a more modest-looking design by\u00a0Kengo Kuma\u00a0which used pieces of wood for a natural Japanese look. Born in Tokyo in 1928, Maki was educated at the University of Tokyo, the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Michigan and Harvard University Graduate School of Design. Before opening his own design firm in 1965 in Tokyo, he worked in various offices including Skidmore Owings and Merrill, or SOM, based in Chicago, and Sert, Jackson & Associates in Cambridge, as well as the campus planning office of Washington University in St. Louis. A devoted educator, Maki, in addition to teaching at Washington University, Harvard and the University of Tokyo, lectured around the world. His essays were published in a collection called \u201cNurturing Dreams\u201d by MIT Press in 2008. In it, he explored the Japanese sense of space called \u201coku,\u201d which Maki described as \u201cthe core of this high-density space organized into multiple layers like an onion.\u201d Utilizing oku allowed the Japanese to deliver a feeling of depth even in a cramped area, according to this theory. \u201cIn the formation of urban space, certain stable concepts that have been sifted and committed to memory by the collective unconscious of the community work automatically,\u201d Maki wrote. \u201cOku, a spatial concept peculiar to Japan, is a good example, and I believe an understanding of this way of perceiving space is important in formulating ideas of what future cities should be like.\u201d Maki was the second Japanese to win the Pritzker, hailed as the Nobel Prize of architecture, after Kenzo Tange, his mentor. Maki, along with fellow Tange students\u00a0Arata Isozaki\u00a0and\u00a0Kisho Kurokawa, were the pillars of Japanese modernism. The Pritzker, in selecting Maki, praised him as part of a new wave of architects rebuilding postwar Japan. \u201cHe uses light in a masterful way making it as tangible a part of every design as are the walls and roof. In each building, he searches for a way to make transparency, translucency and opacity exist in total harmony. He uses detail to give his structures rhythm and scale,\u201d Bill Lacy, a member of the international panel of jurors that selected Maki, said at the time. Maki was honored with other awards, such as the Wolf Prize from Israel in 1988 and the Arnold Brunner Prize from the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1999. In 2011, the American Institute of Architects honored Maki with its highest accolade, the AIA Gold Medal. Japanese media reports said a memorial service was planned. His office declined to give details, saying an official announcement was being prepared", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/style/fumihiko-maki-architect-dies/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "world"}}

The USA beat Pakistan in a historic victory earlier in the tournament but failed to follow it up with a win against heavy favorite India \u2013 despite the underdog pushing the cricket powerhouse close throughout. India now tops Group A with six points having won all three of its games at the World Cup, with the USA in second place with four points. Despite the defeat, the USA still has a good chance of progressing to the next round of the tournament and faces Ireland in their last group stage game, needing a win to secure its spot in the knockout stages. Early Indian dominance If there was ever hope of an upset, it looked like India quickly put a stop to it. Having won the toss, India elected to field first at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium in New York, which has been favorable for bowlers so far throughout the tournament. Arshdeep Singh was given the new ball and with it took a wicket with the very first delivery of the game \u2013 the left-arm seamer swinging a ball back into USA\u2019s opening batter Shayan Jahangir and getting him out leg before wicket (LBW). Singh followed it up with the wicket of Andries Gous in the same over and India was already firmly in the driving seat. The USA innings never really got going following the early dominance from the Indian bowlers and the fielding side continued to pile on the misery for the home nation. Despite Nitish Kumar\u2019s best efforts, leading the American batters with 27 runs, the USA was reduced to 110-8 following its 20 overs batting. Singh was the star of the Indian bowling attack and took an impressive four wickets for just nine runs in the four overs he bowled. USA battles back Needing just 111 to win, most onlookers would have been expecting an easy chase for India. USA bowler Saurabh Netravalkar had other ideas. The left-arm quick picked up the invaluable wicket of Virat Kohli, widely regarded as one of the greatest batters in history, who went out facing his first ball, and then Netravalkar got the wicket of India captain Rohit Sharma. Nerves would have surely been felt throughout the Indian camp but Indian batters Rishabh Pant and Suryakumar Yadav helped ease the worries with a steady partnership. Just when India looked to be cruising to the total, USA managed to pile on the pressure again with Ali Khan bowling out Pant for 18. As the pressure piled up, so did the dot balls and suddenly the underdogs were well in the game. But as all great teams do, India found a way to take back control of proceedings. Yadav, now joined by Shivam Dube, kept the runs ticking to prevent what would have been one of cricket\u2019s greatest ever upsets and scored an impressive 50 runs for India. During the chase, the USA was also penalized for taking too much time between overs and gave five penalty runs to India, which dented US hopes at a pivotal moment. Despite being denied another historic victory, the USA can certainly be pleased with their efforts in defeat. \u201cI\u2019m really proud of the bowling unit today,\u201d USA captain Aaron Jones told the broadcast after the game. \u201cThis is something that we\u2019ve been talking about over the last couple of years, wanting more fans for USA cricket, so now is a time that we\u2019re really enjoying it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/sport/t20-cricket-world-cup-india-beats-usa-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_10_europe_european-elections-explainer-intl", "text": "Results are being announced in the\u00a0European\u00a0parliamentary elections \u2013 one of the world\u2019s biggest democratic exercises \u2013 and a few clear narratives have emerged from the days-long poll. Far-right parties across the continent had strong showings, but their momentum did not cause the center ground of European politics to cave in \u2013 as many had predicted. Instead, liberal and Green groups lost seats and relevance in the European Parliament. Meanwhile, domestic politics was upended in some countries, including France \u2013 where new elections were announced. Here\u2019s what you need to know. Far right makes gains Ahead of the vote, eyes across Europe were fixed mainly on the continent\u2019s far-right parties \u2013 with gains by those groups expected to form a major part of Sunday\u2019s narrative. Those gains did materialize; far-right groups were expected to secure a record number of seats in the European Parliament, dealing a major blow to the continent\u2019s establishment leaders. Far-right parties were set to win around 150 of the parliament\u2019s 720 seats, an exit poll projected, potentially frustrating efforts by mainstream parties to form majorities needed to pass laws. Most of the far-right gains were concentrated in countries that elect large numbers of seats: France, Italy and Germany. But the parties must still work to build a consensus if they are to maximize their political threat. Germany\u2019s AfD is politically homeless: it was removed from the far-right Identity and Democracy (ID) party after its main European candidate, Maximilian Krah, said he did not consider all members of the Nazi group, the SS, to be criminals. Several other far-right parties are among the non-aligned (NI) group, predicted to secure 45 seats. The center holds Despite a far-right surge, the centrist European People\u2019s Party (EPP) was the biggest single winner on Sunday night. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a speech late on Sunday that the group \u2013 predicted to secure the most seats \u2013 could still act as an \u201canchor of stability.\u201d But she called on her political allies to help guard against extremist parties. \u201cThe center is holding. But it is also true that the extremes on the left and on the right have gained support, and this is why the result comes with great responsibility for the parties in the center,\u201d she told an audience in Brussels. Von der Leyen appeared to rule out any possibility of the party banding together with the far-right factions, telling journalists that she will be reaching out to The Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D) and centrist and liberal Renew Europe to form a \u201cbroad majority for a strong Europe.\u201d Von der Leyen, who is seeking a second term as European Commission president, outlined her desire to keep pushing on with parties who are \u201cpro-European, pro-Ukraine, pro-rule-of-law.\u201d National politics in disarray The results massively disrupted politics in several European countries, as gains from previously fringe groups became impossible for some leaders to ignore. French President Emmanuel Macron called a stunning snap election on Sunday after his party was trounced by Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Rally (RN). \u201cI have decided to give you back the choice of your parliamentary future by voting. I am therefore dissolving the National Assembly this evening,\u201d Macron said. The elections to pick a new parliament will take place on 30 June and 7 July. France\u2019s main far-right electoral lists in the European Elections took more than one in three votes cast, according to official results from the French Interior Ministry Monday. France returns \u2013 the European elections list for Marine Le Pen\u2019s RN party \u2013 and the list headed by her niece Marion Mar\u00e9chal won 36.83% of votes cast, more than the next three parties combined. In a celebratory speech at the RN headquarters before Macron\u2019s shock announcement, party leader Jordan Bardella said the \u201cunprecedented defeat for the current government marks the end of a cycle, and Day 1 of the post-Macron era.\u201d Belgium\u2019s Prime Minister Alexander De Croo meanwhile resigned after his party suffered a disastrous defeat in national and European parliamentary elections. The 48-year-old politician struggled to hold back his tears when announcing the decision on Sunday evening in Brussels. \u201cI was the figurehead of this campaign. This is not the result I had hoped for, and I, therefore, take responsibility for this result. It was not meant to be,\u201d De Croo told journalists. Meloni and Tusk have good nights Few major EU leaders enjoyed results night, but Italy\u2019s Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni saw her party make gains, and ended the process as a major player in European politics. Her domestic party, Brothers of Italy, was the most rightwing to be elected to government in Italy since that of Benito Mussolini, the wartime fascist leader. But Meloni has proven a pragmatic figure in Europe, becoming an ally of von der Leyen, and a staunch supporter of Ukraine, while pushing the bloc to take a firmer stance on migration. Those efforts could accelerate after Brothers of Italy won the country\u2019s vote. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Donald Tusk\u2019s efforts to make Poland a force in Brussels were boosted after his party held off the populist opposition Law and Justice (PiS) group to secure an outright victory. Tusk has rebuilt Warsaw\u2019s reputation at the European table after defeating PiS in a national election last October. The former European Council President made reintegration with Europe a key pillar of his campaign and his time in office, while the strategic significance of Poland to the bloc has increased following Russia\u2019s invasion of neighboring Ukraine. Brussels\u2019 mainstream leaders will also be relieved that Hungary\u2019s authoritarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, for so long a thorn in the EU\u2019s side, was dealt a blow on Sunday. His party Fidesz suffered its worst European election results to date, ceding ground to its center-right opponents. Greens fall back As fringe parties on the right made gains, left-wing groups, and in particular the Greens, were squeezed across Europe. Early results showed that Green support in France and Germany suffered especially huge drops in seats. \u201cThe losses in Germany and France are obviously a blow,\u201d Bas Eickhout, the Greens/EFA vice-president and lead candidate of the European Green Party, admitted in a statement as results came in. The group insisted they would work to push the new parliament to prioritize work on the climate, but their standing is severely diminished and it remains to be seen how much Europe\u2019s leaders will need to rely on their support. The European Commission announced one of the world\u2019s most ambitious goals to slash planet-heating pollution in February, but faces opposition in rural areas around the continent, with farmers\u2019 unions saying the plans represent a threat to their livelihoods.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/europe/european-elections-explainer-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "world"}}

A video recently shared on various Chinese news and social media sites shows a set of timers installed above a row of toilet cubicles in a female washroom, with each stall getting its own digital counter. When a stall is unoccupied, the pixelated LED screen displays the word \u201cempty\u201d in green.

It felt like I was being monitored.\u201d A staff member at the attraction reportedly told the Xioxiang Morning Herald that the timers were installed to cope with an increase in visitors to the attraction \u2013 and that includes the facilities inside the tourist site. \u201cThey aren\u2019t there to control the durations you could use the bathrooms,\u201d the staff member was quoted by the newspaper as saying. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible that we would kick someone out [of the bathroom stall] midway. And we aren\u2019t setting a time limit such as five or 10 minutes of how long one could use the toilets.\u201d Nanchang Evening News, a state-run newspaper, quoted a staff member of the park\u00a0as saying the timer has been in operation since May 1 of this year and is primarily a safety measure, \u201censuring the well-being of all guests, in case some guests use the toilet for an extended period and an emergency occurs.\u201d The news has stirred up plenty of debate on China\u2019s social media sites. Some netizens on popular micro-blogging platform Weibo supported the new timers, saying they would discourage visitors from sitting and scrolling on their mobile phones while in the stalls. \u201cA tourist site isn\u2019t an office \u2013 who would spend their time in the toilets?

Others said that it would help those who have actual medical emergencies and may not be able to call for assistance. Record-breaking visitor numbers Inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2001, Yungang Buddhist Grottoes is one of the biggest attractions in northern China\u2019s Shanxi province. The ticketed scenic area received 3 million visitors in 2023, a record high for the tourist site and a significant increase from its second busiest year, in 2019 (with 1.98 million visits).

Nearly 160,000 Allied troops landed on five stretches of the German-occupied Normandy coastline on June 6, 1944. Operation Overlord \u2013 as D-Day was codenamed \u2013 remains, to this day, the largest amphibious invasion in history, \ufeffand was a crucial turning point in defeating the Nazis in World War II. Omaha Beach was the deadliest of the landing sites as German forces were entrenched in fortified cliff positions above allowing them to fire on the first waves of US soldiers as they reached the shore. Nearly 10,000 Allied troops were killed or wounded on D-Day. Exact figures of German casualties on the day are not known, however it has been estimated to be between 4,000 and 9,000 service personnel. On Thursday morning, King Charles and Queen Camilla attended the UK Ministry of Defence and the Royal British Legion\u2019s commemorative event at the British Normandy Memorial at Ver-sur-Mer. Charles is patron of both the Royal British Legion and Normandy Memorial Trust. The King, wearing his\u00a0Field Marshal No 4 Tropical Service dress\u00a0uniform with medals and decorations, urged allies to \u201crecall lessons that come to us again and again,\u201d while addressing D-Day veterans. \u201cHow fortunate we were and the entire free world that a generation of men and women in the United Kingdom and other Allied nations did not flinch when the moment came to face that test,\u201d Charles said, adding that his grandfather, King George VI, described the events of D-Day as \u201cthe supreme test.\u201d Charles reflected on the qualities of the armed forces involved, saying they \u201ccarried out their duty with a humbling sense of resolve and determination.\u201d He also used the speech to reflect on the past through the lens of the present, saying: \u201cWe recall the lesson that comes to us again and again across the decades. Three nations must stand together to oppose tyranny.\u201d Charles also spoke in French, thanking the people of France for their \u201cwarmth\u201d and \u201cgenerosity\u201d towards D-Day veterans, which he said is the \u201cmost moving and memorable part of these anniversaries.\u201d While the King traveled to France for commemorations, he did not join world leaders - including Macron and his US counterpart Joe Biden \u2013 later Thursday as they gather at Omaha Beach to honor troops for their bravery and sacrifice eight decades ago. Instead, Prince William represented Britain\u2019s royal family at the international ceremony at Omaha Beach. The optics of seeing the Prince of Wales instead of his father will not have been be lost on those within the royal household, as well as royal-watchers. Nonetheless, CNN understands that it wasn\u2019t a deliberate orchestration. William, 41, has deputized for Charles before, such as when he traveled to Kuwait for the funeral of Emir Sheikh Nawaf al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah in December. However, seeing the future monarch in the company of other heads of state was a powerful visual and speaks to the longer transition which will prepare the public for King William V\u2019s reign. King Charles also only recently returned to public engagements after getting the green light from his doctors who were \u201cencouraged\u201d by his progress. He is continuing to receive treatment and each engagement the 75-year-old sovereign carries out is being reviewed and adapted where necessary by his medical team to ensure his continued recovery. That simple reason of following medical advice appears to be behind the King\u2019s absence at the international commemoration on Thursday afternoon. A royal source told CNN that it was considered a step too far at this stage but that the monarch was delighted the Prince of Wales was representing the nation. William has been an ever-present fixture as the royal family marked the D-Day anniversary in recent days. Earlier Thursday, the heir to the British throne paid tribute at the Canadian commemorative ceremony at the Juno Beach Centre in Courseulles-Sur-Mer, where he joined veterans as well as current serving personnel before making a speech and laying a wreath. A day earlier, William had joined Charles and Camilla at the UK\u2019s national commemorative event in Portsmouth. The city on England\u2019s south coast was one of the places Allied troops sailed from before the Normandy landings. William paid tribute to veterans who \u201ccame from across our nation and from all walks of life to join in the fight against tyranny. Many of those that took up arms had never seen combat before, some were still only in their teens.\u201d Meanwhile, in his own moving speech, King Charles told crowds that \u201cthe stories of courage, resilience and solidarity\u201d must not be forgotten and that they are a reminder \u201cof what we owe to that great wartime generation.\u201d Charles added: \u201cIt is our duty to ensure that we, and future generations, do not forget their service and their sacrifice.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/europe/prince-william-king-charles-d-day-anniversary-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "world"}}

They are held over multiple days because, despite being elections to an EU institution, they are still arranged and managed as national\u00a0ballots\u00a0by each of the EU\u2019s 27 member states.  In some countries, they may all be\u00a0held\u00a0on a single day, whereas others take place over several days. Because the elections are managed at a national level, they are not all carried out in the same exact way. However, they must all employ a proportional representation system\u00a0\u2013where the number of lawmakers\u00a0elected\u00a0to the parliament directly correlates to the percentage of people who voted for them. Once all the votes have been counted, each national political party will be assigned a number of\u00a0members of European Parliament (MEPs)\u00a0relative to their vote share. It is up to the member states to determine how this is assigned. Once they have been appointed to the parliament, MEPs can then join a European political party, which allows them to sit in a group in the parliament. These parties and groupings are multinational and based on a loose set of shared beliefs.\u00a0The bigger the grouping, the more influence it has in parliament. Results will start to come in late on Sunday, but full results will not be known until at least Monday. What\u2019s the point of the European Parliament and what do MEPs do? The European Parliament sits primarily in Brussels, Belgium, but moves roughly once a month to Strasbourg, France. It is the legislative branch of the EU and one of the bloc\u2019s three main institutions \u2013 along with the European Commission, which is the executive branch, and the European Council, which is made up of ministers from the governments of the 27 member states. It is the only EU institution where\u00a0representatives\u00a0are directly elected,\u00a0and MEPs pass laws which are applied all over the bloc. In order for any legislation to be implemented, both the council and parliament have to agree. One of the parliament\u2019s most crucial roles is approving the makeup of the commission, which is ultimately responsible for the political direction of the world\u2019s largest trading bloc, and it has the final say on who is appointed as president of the commission. Currently the top job is filled by Germany\u2019s Ursula von der Leyen, who is seeking a second term at the helm. The parliament also has\u00a0ultimate approval\u00a0over\u00a0the billions of euros allocated in the EU budget. It often has the final\u00a0word\u00a0on major policy issues\u00a0such as\u00a0the budget, trade\u00a0and\u00a0sanctions on foreign nationals. The parliament can also put major international objectives in the deep freeze. For example, A comprehensive mutual investment agreement between the EU and China is effectively on hold while some MEPs are under sanctions from China. The parliament as a whole has refused to advance the agreement until the sanctions are lifted. What are the biggest issues in this vote? Since this week\u2019s election is in effect 27 individual national elections, some\u00a0issues are in play in some countries but not in others. Broadly speaking, immigration, climate change, security and support for Ukraine are issues that matter across the bloc. While\u00a0irregular\u00a0migration figures are lower than they were\u00a0during\u00a0the 2015-2016\u00a0refugee\u00a0crisis, it is still a sensitive issue across the EU, as some countries\u00a0bear a disproportionate share of\u00a0the burden\u00a0while\u00a0others are loathe to\u00a0do their part. Slowing the effects of climate change and making Europe greener has been a priority for a long time. However, some countries now balk at the cost of\u00a0cutting fossil fuel emissions. The EU is largely united on its support for Ukraine, but that too could be affected if populists like\u00a0France\u2019s Marine\u00a0Le Pen are elected\u00a0to lead national governments. What are the political groupings? If the\u00a0720 MEPs representing 27 countries and hundreds of different domestic political parties\u00a0were all left to their own devices, things would\u00a0get very complicated. To simplify the work of the parliament, leaders of national governments form alliances with each other based on their shared political beliefs \u2013 the European political parties. If\u00a0a politician is\u00a0a member of, for example, French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s Renaissance party in France,\u00a0he or she\u00a0will stand for that party as an MEP at a national level. If\u00a0they\u00a0are then elected to the European Parliament,\u00a0they\u00a0will join the centrist, liberal European party, Renew Europe \u2013\u00a0which currently has members from 24 of the 27 EU members. Once\u00a0seated\u00a0in parliament,\u00a0they\u00a0will sit alongside the other MEPs from Renew parties in other countries as a political grouping. There are seven main groupings, ranging from the extremes of the far right to the far left. The two dominant groupings are the center-right conservative European People\u2019s Party (EPP) and the center-left\u00a0Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D). Due to proportional representation, no single group has anything resembling a majority and therefore\u00a0they\u00a0must form broad coalitions\u00a0to get anything done in parliament. The EPP and S&D (or their previous incarnations) have dominated this coalition\u00a0for decades. While these two parties are still expected to be the largest after the elections, all eyes are on the other main right-wing groups,\u00a0the\u00a0European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) and the hard-right, populist Identity and Democracy (ID). What\u2019s likely to happen in the election? It is expected that the EPP and S&D centrist coalition will largely hold. However, it is also expected that ECR and ID will make significant gains that result\u00a0in more power in the next parliament. The two hard-right parties have not said they will work together and the leaderships of the two groups are known to dislike each other. Giorgia Meloni, the Italian prime minister and president of the ECR\u00a0bloc, has an eye on working with the mainstream right at an EU level, for instance. During\u00a0the\u00a02022 Italian\u00a0general\u00a0election, much was made of Meloni\u2019s right-wing rhetoric. She was a hardliner on immigration,\u00a0and\u00a0had\u00a0questioned LGBTQ+ rights, among other things. However, since winning she has been pragmatic in working with\u00a0those in power\u00a0at a European level \u2013 most notably\u00a0von der Leyen, the commission\u2019s president, who is herself a member of the more mainstream EPP. Von der Leyen even went so far as\u00a0to visit\u00a0the Italian island of Lampedusa, which has\u00a0been\u00a0an arrival point for\u00a0large numbers of irregular\u00a0migrants, to set out a\u00a010-point EU plan\u00a0to support Italy with the influx. Critics say that\u00a0Meloni\u00a0has sold out; supporters say that she has played her cards perfectly and managed to pull the EU\u2019s center in her direction.\u00a0Evidence of this might be the EU\u00a0having\u00a0finally\u00a0agreed a deal\u00a0earlier\u00a0this year\u00a0on how it would share the\u00a0weight\u00a0of irregular migration, after years of deadlock and negotiation. How could the election affect European politics? The\u00a0possibility\u00a0that the EU\u2019s political center might be up for grabs\u00a0is the most important context of these elections. The opaque and fluid nature of politics at a European level means that a lot can change over the course of a five-year period. Between the EPP and S&D, there might be a centrist coalition on day one of this\u00a0new\u00a0parliament. But these are not formal coalitions, rather loose alliances that vote together, issue by issue. This is where the idea of a\u00a0right-wing\u00a0ECR and ID axis becomes significant. The rise of the far-right\u2019s influence in European Parliament follows a similar trend at the national level in a number of major EU member states. National\u00a0elections\u00a0are\u00a0set to take place in France in 2027,\u00a0in which\u00a0right-wing populist\u00a0Le Pen could emerge victorious. She is the chair of ID and has recently made obvious efforts to detoxify the\u00a0bloc\u00a0by expelling\u00a0lawmakers from\u00a0the far-right Alternative for Germany\u00a0(AfD)\u00a0from\u00a0its ranks\u00a0following accusations of antisemitism.\u00a0 A\u00a0victory in the French presidential election would\u00a0of course\u00a0make Le Pen a much bigger major player in European politics. That might not mean any formal coalition between the center-right EPP and ID, but the politics of the European Parliament is a sliding scale of sorts and, if France shifts right, it\u2019s fair to say the center-right will take note. There are EPP members (and certainly ECR members) who will agree with ID members on\u00a0matters\u00a0such as\u00a0immigration and climate change. When those issues come up and the parliament has a role to play, it\u2019s not implausible that\u00a0the\u00a0ECR and ID could\u00a0then put\u00a0huge pressure on EPP lawmakers to vote the same way. It is, after all, always worth remembering that these people must still answer to their domestic voters, who can sack them at the next election.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/europe/european-parliament-elections-2024-explained-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_10_europe_michael-mosley-died-unwell-greek-police-intl-scli-gbr", "text": "British TV personality and health guru Michael Mosley may have died shortly after becoming unwell while walking alone on the Greek island of Symi, local police told CNN on Monday. Mosley, a television doctor who popularized a type of intermittent fasting known as the 5:2 diet, was on vacation when he went missing on Wednesday, sparking an enormous days-long search involving the police, fire service, coast guard and volunteers. His body was found on Sunday about a two-hour walk from Agios Nikolaos beach, from where he set off on his walk. Police believe he died around 4 p.m. local time (9 a.m. ET) on Wednesday, the day he went missing, Greek police spokeswoman Konstantia Dimoglidou told CNN. An initial autopsy concluded that Mosley died from natural causes and that there were no injuries on his body that could have caused his death, the BBC reported. Dimoglidou told CNN that police do not believe Mosley had been sitting down for long before dying, as his time of death was similar to the length of time it would have taken for him to reach the spot. Mosley\u2019s body was found when a boat carrying the island\u2019s mayor, Lefteris Papakalodoukas, and some journalists spotted him lying face-up next to a fence about 20 meters (66 feet) above Agia Marina beach, Papakalodoukas told the Associated Press. The position in which his body was found suggests he was sitting at the time of his death, Dimoglidou said. Mosley\u2019s wife, Dr. Clare Bailey, paid tribute to her \u201cwonderful, funny, kind and brilliant\u201d husband after his body was found, saying that he \u201cdid an incredible climb, took the wrong route and collapsed where he couldn\u2019t be easily seen by the extensive search team.\u201d   His family have identified the body to police but a formal identification using DNA samples has yet to take place, Dimoglidou added. The television doctor was known for British documentary shows such as Channel 4\u2019s \u201cMichael Mosley: Who Made Britain Fat?\u201d and the BBC\u2019s \u201cTrust Me, I\u2019m A Doctor.\u201d The 67-year-old broadcaster was also a regular on talk shows such as the BBC\u2019s \u201cThe One Show\u201d and ITV\u2019s \u201cThis Morning,\u201d and was a columnist for the Daily Mail. He authored a book on the Fast 800 diet, which focuses on time-restricted eating for rapid weight loss. His wife wrote a recipe book as part of \u201cThe Fast 800\u201d book series. In 2002, Mosley was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for outstanding non-fiction special (informational) after executive producing the 2001 BBC mini-series \u201cThe Human Face,\u201d which examined the science behind facial beauty, expression and fame. The fathe- of-four deliberately infested himself with parasites to learn more about them for BBC\u2019s 2014 show \u201cInfested! Living with Parasites.\u201d Mosley\u2019s impact on public health, particularly in Britain, was evident in the tributes paid to him. Former lawmaker Tom Watson wrote on social media that Mosley \u201cwas a hero to me,\u201d and that he \u201chelped thousands of people get well and healthy. I\u2019m one of them.\u201d Meanwhile, a spokesperson for British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said Mosley \u201cwill be known as an extraordinary broadcaster who used his platform to influence and change the way we think about many public health issues,\u201d according to PA Media.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/europe/michael-mosley-died-unwell-greek-police-intl-scli-gbr/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_07_weather_heat-dome-wave-record-temperatures-southwest", "text": "A dangerous heat wave is expanding into new areas of the West and lingering in others Friday, bringing with it record-breaking temperatures and a serious risk of heat-related illness. The searing heat has already taken its toll. Since last weekend, multiple people in different parts of the US have died or have been hospitalized due to heat-related illnesses. The worst of the heat peaked Thursday for much of California and the Southwest, but unseasonably hot conditions will stick around in these areas and expand into the Pacific Northwest at least through the weekend. Heat alerts are in effect for more than 16 million people in California, Nevada, Arizona, Utah and New Mexico. Most will last through Friday but alerts in Las Vegas and Death Valley, California, last into Saturday. Several notable temperature records were broken Thursday in California, Arizona and Nevada. In California, a high of 122 degrees in Death Valley broke a daily record set in 1996. And in Fresno, a 121-year-old record was tied Thursday when the city maxed out at 107 degrees. Phoenix recorded its first high of 110 degrees or more this year when thermometers topped out at a daily record-setting 113 degrees Thursday. Las Vegas soared to 111 degrees Thursday, the earliest in the year the city has reached the mark, breaking the daily record of 110 degrees set in 2010. Several people across US have died from heat-related illnesses Six people believed to be migrants have died because of the heat in the past week along the US-Mexico border from southwestern Texas to New Mexico, according to US Border Patrol and the Sunland Park, New Mexico, fire department. Four people died \u201cfrom heat stroke and dehydration\u201d while triple-digit temperatures baked the area last weekend, the US Border Patrol, El Paso Sector said. Two more people were discovered in a desert area about six miles from the border in Sunland Park and were pronounced dead Wednesday, Sunland Park fire chief Daniel Medrano told CNN. Sunland Park is around 10 miles northwest of El Paso, Texas, along the New Mexico-Mexico border. Excessive heat is the leading weather related killer in the US, according to the National Weather Service. \u201cThis is especially true in the urban centers, where population density, the urban heat island, and building construction exacerbate the effects of excessive heat,\u201d the weather service says. \u201cA combination of high heat and humidity can lead to heat related illness, including heat cramps, heat exhaustion, and heat stroke.\u201d In the East, a 59-year-old man died of heat-related complications in Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland, officials said Wednesday. Additional details about the man\u2019s death, which was the state\u2019s first heat-related death of the year, were not released. Heat proved challenging for firefighters battling a blaze in California\u2019s Napa County Wednesday. Four firefighters were sent to area hospitals for injuries related to difficult terrain and \u201chot summer conditions,\u201d according to CAL Fire\u2019s Sonoma-Lake-Napa Unit. All four are expected to make full recoveries. Phoenix emergency responders on Thursday say they hospitalized 11 people due to heat exhaustion while they were attending a Donald Trump rally at the Dream City Church. With the risk of heat-related illnesses increasing for millions across the country, officials in several states are trying to keep residents safe during the smoldering heat. In California, cooling centers have been set up for those affected by triple-digit heat. As Texas contends with both severe storms and excessive heat, a state disaster declaration remains active. Hazardous heat expected into weekend Heat will continue through the weekend before easing off a bit early next week. However, many typically hot areas in the West will still have to contend with temperatures up to 10 degrees above normal and warm nighttime lows will make it difficult for those vulnerable to extreme conditions to be able to cool off. The Las Vegas metro area is at \u201cextreme\u201d risk from the heat through Saturday, according to a scale from the National Weather Service that gauges heat\u2019s potential impact on people\u2019s health. The highest level on the heat risk scale means residents without enough cooling and hydration will be impacted, and \u201cimpacts are likely in most health systems, heat-sensitive industries and infrastructure.\u201d Several more large metro areas in Arizona, California, New Mexico and Texas will face a \u201cmajor\u201d Level 3 of 4 heat risk. Summerlike heat will expand north and east Friday and reach the Northwest and parts of the Rockies. Records could be broken in parts of Oregon, Washington and Idaho from Friday through the weekend. While it won\u2019t be record-breaking, Seattle could come close to 80 degrees on Saturday, 10 degrees warmer than what\u2019s typical for early June.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/weather/heat-dome-wave-record-temperatures-southwest/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "world"}}

She was pictured in a towel lying across terracotta tiles, walking bare-shouldered along the rugged Capri coastline, and gazing out at the water at Casa Malaparte where the movie was filmed. And just as Bardot was to Godard, Jennie was designer Simon Porte Jacquemus\u2019s star on the runway on Monday. In her surprise runway debut, the 28-year-old closed the show of minimalist form and colorful threads in a backless halter dress, paired with a turquoise shoulder bag and zebra-print heels. The move added to her already significant list of accomplishments as a singer, rapper, and recent foray into acting, and her role as a brand ambassador for Chanel. In recent years, Korean pop stars have become the darlings of the fashion world, drawing in crowds as the obsession with Korean pop culture becomes a global phenomenon. Given their lucrative appeal, more and more luxury fashion houses have signed deals with leading celebrities. Fans waiting outside venues have become a fixture as they look to get a glimpse of the K-pop celebrities attending fashion shows.

{"id": "2024_05_25_style_zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk", "text": "Above Beijing\u2019s imperial center rises Jingshan, or Prospect Hill. From a pagoda at its modest peak, a panoramic view of the city presents itself. To the south, the dull golden roofs of the Forbidden City crest and fall, pulling the eye southward to Tiananmen \u2014 the Gate of Heavenly Peace \u2014 and the vast square of the same name just beyond. To the east stand the smooth metallic skyscrapers of the city\u2019s business district. To the north, at the top of Beijing\u2019s central axis \u2014 its so-called dragon\u2019s vein \u2014 sit the Bell and Drum Towers, which once acted as the city\u2019s collective timepiece. And stretching all along the western periphery are the calm, tree-lined waters of the manmade lakes, dug by hand for the pleasure of past emperors. It\u2019s this aerial view of \u201cZhongnanhai,\u201d meaning \u201cmiddle and southern seas,\u201d and the surrounding buildings that today\u2019s Chinese leaders prefer you did not see. That\u2019s because the 1,500-acre site of repurposed imperial pavilions and temples, along with gray modern offices has formed the leadership compound for the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP)  since 1950. As the seat of power, Zhongnanhai is often thought of as China\u2019s equivalent to the White House, or the Kremlin. Synonymous with China\u2019s communist party elite, and among the country\u2019s most secretive places, it is ringed by a centuries-old red ochre wall, with countless CCTV cameras periscoping above it \u2014 and patrolled assiduously by security forces in both plain clothes and uniform. A peaceful getaway For Chinese leader Xi Jinping\u2019s imperial forebears, the site served a somewhat different function. While emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties ruled their vast kingdom from within the Forbidden City, they built temples, halls and living quarters in Zhongnanhai; less grandly ceremonial than those of the palace, they were often oriented to take advantage of the views afforded by the area\u2019s tranquil waters and carefully planned gardens. Many of these emperors came to favor passing their days surrounded by drooping willows in the cool and quiet of this cultivated pleasure garden. A story relayed by the scholar Geremie Barm\u00e9 in his book \u201cThe Forbidden City\u201d tells of the 18th-century Qianlong Emperor\u2019s daily routine at Zhongnanhai: Each morning, after a first breakfast of cold swallows nest soup, he would travel by heated palanquin to the gardens\u2019\u00a0Studio of Convivial Delight,\u00a0a pavilion he built to capitalize on the view of the South Lake, where he would breakfast again on a meal of\u00a018 dishes. As the historian and author of \u201cThe Shortest History of China,\u201d Linda Jaivin, told CNN via email: \u201cThere is something outrageous and yet poetic about the incredible coordination and effort required of a team of bearers, cooks and attendants, just so that an emperor could come, catch a view of the magnificent Ocean Terrace, scoff his food and (leave).\u201d The first ruler to view Zhongnanhai as primarily a place to govern from, not simply relax in, was the Empress Dowager Cixi, who effectively controlled China for almost five decades from 1861. She lived for many years in the gardens\u2019 Hall of Ceremonial Phoenixes, which became the center of political authority in China. She would die there in 1908. The serene surroundings of Zhongnanhai also became, under Cixi, a place of punishment and confinement. In 1898, following attempted reforms that displeased her, Cixi imprisoned her nephew, the Guangxu Emperor, on Yingtai Island, which juts out into the southern lake. Built as a miniature version of the mythical Penglai island, home to the immortals of Chinese legend, the tiny piece of land would become the emperor\u2019s home for most of his life, bar a brief period when the Boxer rebellion of 1900 forced the whole court to flee the capital. He would die on Yingtai Island from arsenic poisoning the day before the Empress Dowager herself. His imprisonment and death, said writer M. A. Aldrich, author of \u201cThe Search for a Vanishing Beijing: A Guide to China\u2019s Capital Through the Ages,\u201d perhaps adds a touch of poignancy for any subsequent resident of Zhongnanhai. \u201cIn addition to being a site that preserves sites of imperial splendor,\u201d he told CNN, \u201cit also functions as a reminder to the political elite about the consequences for stepping out of line.\u201d For Aldrich, however, the Zhongnanhai compound also represents the destructive impulses of the CCP towards its adopted capital in the years after 1949, when Mao Zedong proclaimed the foundation of the People\u2019s Republic. \u201cAs a political symbol of the New China, it has been torn up, rebuilt, expanded, and revamped so many times that its connection with its elegant past has been lost,\u201d Aldrich said. Architectural changes There have been serious revisions to the architecture of Zhongnanhai since the end of imperial rule in 1912. After the last emperor abdicated the throne, China\u2019s new president Yuan Shikai granted him the right to live on the northern section of the Forbidden City \u2014 and then took Zhongnanhai to be his new administration\u2019s headquarters. The changes he made to the imperial gardens were disparaged by many of the Westerners who visited them. \u201cWhatever may be one\u2019s opinion as to whether Yuan Shikai \u2018exalted his aim\u2019 in his political career, he certainly cannot be said to have done so as builder and architect,\u201d wrote L.C. Arlington and William Lewisohn in their 1935 book \u201cIn Search of Old Peking,\u201d \u201cfor all the buildings that have been erected or restored by him are in the worst possible taste.\u201d Most notable of these changes \u2014 at least to ordinary Beijingers \u2014 was the repurposing of a two-story pavilion at the very south of the gardens. Known as the Precious Moon Tower, it had been built decades earlier by the Qianlong Emperor for a homesick lover, a Muslim woman from Xinjiang, taken to Beijing as part of the spoils of war. The concubine would gaze south from the tower toward a mock mosque and bazaar the emperor had especially constructed to assuage her longing for home. Yuan refashioned this pavilion into the main entrance to his presidential compound, and established a tall watchtower just to its east. The gate was named Xinhuamen, or the Gate of New China. Today, the structure remains coated in the same deep red that graces the walls of all Beijing\u2019s imperial buildings, with a roof of glazed yellow tiles and detailing that runs below the roofline, picked out in blue and gold. The gate is now flanked by two red banners that speak to its modern purpose as China\u2019s political and party headquarters: \u201cLong Live the Great Communist Party of China\u201d reads one; and \u201cLong Live the Invincible Mao Zedong Thought\u201d on the other. On a screen wall recessed behind the entrance way, Chinese characters written in Mao\u2019s own calligraphic style declare: \u201cServe the People.\u201d Facing out onto Beijing\u2019s main east-west thoroughfare, the gate remains the most conspicuous part of Zhongnanhai. The rest of the compound has, since 1989, been firmly off-limits to the Chinese public. Seat of power Initially, after the communist victory in China\u2019s civil war in 1949, Mao Zedong took up residence at Shuangqing Villa in Fragrant Hills, another former imperial garden to the west of Beijing. Though wary of establishing himself in the imperial heart of Beijing \u2014 it is said that he refused ever to enter the Forbidden City, for fear of being associated with the power structures of old, feudal China he had fought to overthrow \u2014 Mao ultimately moved into Zhongnanhai and, in late 1949, he set up in the\u00a0Garden of Abundant Beneficence,\u00a0a large courtyard compound favored by both the Qianlong and Kangxi emperors, where he would hold court with dignitaries\u00a0and live\u00a0until 1966. Having re-established Zhongnanhai as a center of political power in the new China, Mao set about rebuilding the compound according to his tastes. \u201cSince 1949, an assortment of new architecture styles has encroached into Zhongnanhai, with a tennis court, gymnasium, swimming pools and Western buildings topped off with Chinese eave roofs adding a discordant note that would not have been appreciated by its traditionally-minded original owners,\u201d said Aldrich. In 1966, Mao moved from the Garden of Abundant Beneficence to a specially built house beside his beloved indoor swimming pool. He often summoned officials to speak to him as he bobbed in the water \u2014 and famously received Russian leader Nikita Khrushchev at his pool during a 1958 visit. \u201cTheir interpreters had to pace alongside the edge of the pool,\u201d said Jaivin. \u201cThe Russian couldn\u2019t swim and had to wear water wings. Mao loved both swimming and putting Khrushchev in his place. Finally, Khrushchev got sick of it, and clambered out to sit on the edge, dangling his feet in the water.\u201d In the residence next door, Mao lined his rooms with bookshelves housing an extensive library of Chinese classical literature. \u201cIt was here,\u201d noted Aldrich, \u201cwith the background trappings of a scholar, that he met Nixon and Kissinger in 1972.\u201d Most subsequent leaders have preferred to keep a house outside the Zhongnanhai compound. Deng Xiaoping lived, from 1977, in a courtyard house on a nearby lane adjacent to Beihai, the \u201cNorthern Sea\u201d of central Beijing\u2019s chain of lakes. While not officially disclosed, it is believed that more contemporary leaders, including Xi Jinping and his predecessors Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, have maintained homes in an exclusive gated compound in Jade Spring Hill, sometimes called the \u201cback garden\u201d of Chinese politics, out to the city\u2019s west. Aldrich noted that those leaders and party cadres who used Zhongnanhai as their primary residence often attracted unwelcome scrutiny for their activities, particularly during years of political turbulence. \u201cIn his memoirs, Chairman Mao\u2019s physician, Li Zhisui, commented that (the complex\u2019s) residents were always under surveillance,\u201d Aldrich said. \u201cDuring the Cultural Revolution, the simple act of making a fire would bring down the wrath of the security guards on the perpetrator. It was believed that such a fire was proof that incriminating or seditious materials were being destroyed.\u201d The imperial gardens offering vistas of Zhongnanhai\u2019s lakes have, today, been filled in with dozens of gray offices and meeting halls, many of which date to 1970s, when Zhongnanhai underwent significant razing and renovation \u2014 the rebuilding was so extensive that one visitor in 1979 described the grounds resembling a construction site, with muddy roads that were impossible to walk on. The contemporary compound splits roughly in two, with the northern buildings, on the banks of the \u201cmiddle lake,\u201d used as the headquarters of China\u2019s top executive body, the State Council. It is here that foreign dignitaries are admitted. Around the \u201csouthern lake,\u201d meanwhile, are the headquarters of the CCP, including, within Qinzheng Hall (the Hall of Diligent Government), the offices of the general secretary of the party (a post currently held by Xi). Many of the most historically significant political events to occur at Zhongnanhai have taken place in Huairen Hall, or the Hall of Cherished Compassion, on the western side of the Middle Lake. The hall was added to the imperial park during the late Qing dynasty, but was then extensively remodeled by the CCP in the early 1950s to impart a more august socialist grandeur. It is a broad, imposing ceremonial hall with staggered roofs of glazed green tiles falling in curved lines to upturned corners; the facade of austere grey brick is interrupted by red wooden pillars, windows and doors. The building\u2019s capacious interior houses a large auditorium, as well as numerous smaller meeting rooms. The hall has, for decades, served as the main meeting place for China\u2019s Politburo, the party\u2019s decision-making body usually comprising about two dozen members. On occasion, it has also hosted the Politburo\u2019s Standing Committee, the core of China\u2019s political elite, (the power of both bodies has notably dwindled in the era of Xi), though they most commonly meet in Qinzheng Hall, close to the general secretary\u2019s office. During the tumult of the Cultural Revolution vital discussions and debates occurred at Huairen Hall, and, in the months after its conclusion, it was there that three of the so-called Gang of Four \u2014 the political faction that included Mao\u2019s wife held responsible for the worst excesses of the era \u2014 were arrested, tricked into attending a meeting they thought was about the publication of the fifth volume of Mao\u2019s Selected Works. In April 1989, former party head Hu Yaobang suffered a heart-attack during a Politburo meeting at Huairen; his death a week later would trigger the Tiananmen Square protests that the government forcibly cracked down on in early June of that year. However, the compound hasn\u2019t always been so forbidden for the masses following the collapse of China\u2019s imperial dynasty. In the late 1920s, it became a park, with tourists allowed to boat on and swim in the lakes, while in the 1980s, the public could access some of its scenic and historical spots, including\u00a0Mao\u2019s\u00a0former residence, on\u00a0organized weekend tours.\u00a0Even early in 1989, a journalist for the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0was able to casually\u00a0drive\u00a0a senior official into the compound and drop him off inside.\u00a0During a period of warmer US and China relations in 2011, former Chinese president\u00a0Hu Jintao\u00a0invited\u00a0a group of American high school students to Zhongnanhai. Modern security concerns Today, Zhongnanhai is more closely-guarded than ever, though the inexorable development of the city has caused problems in maintaining the compound\u2019s secrecy. When an annex to the nearby Beijing Hotel was built in\u00a01973, authorities were panicked by the realization that from its upper floors one could quite easily see \u2013 and potentially target a sniper rifle \u2013 into Zhongnanhai. A building was hastily erected on the western edge of the Forbidden City to restrict this view. Likewise in 2018, when Beijing\u2019s new tallest building was\u00a0completed\u00a0\u2013 the 528-meter Citic tower, better known as the \u201cZun\u201d \u2013 the country\u2019s national security apparatus reportedly requisitioned the top floors amid fears that visitors or occupants might be able to spy into the compound. Beijing authorities did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on the security situation at the time. Zhongnanhai\u2019s entrance, Xinhuamen, has also been the site of repeated demonstrations in recent decades; in 1989, it was a gathering point for students taking part in the Tiananmen protests, whilst in 1999, more than 10,000 members of the since-banned Falun Gong gathered on the sidewalks near Zhongnanhai to protest their treatment at the hands of the government. So, while Zhongnanhai is sometimes compared to the White House, Aldrich argues that the paranoia with which the compound is today guarded makes it more like the imperial palace of centuries past: \u201cSince ordinary people are not allowed to enter Zhongnanhai, it is probably more appropriate to describe it as a \u2018New Forbidden City\u2019 for China\u2019s ruling elite rather than a place with a personal political resonance for the average citizen,\u201d he said. \u201cHeck, even the Kremlin is open to tourists!\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/style/zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_sport_jerry-west-obit-nba-logo-spt-intl", "text": "You can\u2019t tell the story of the modern NBA without legendary Los Angeles Lakers player and executive Jerry West, who has passed away at the age of 86. If you\u2019re unfamiliar with West\u2019s influence on the NBA landscape, consider this \u2013 West\u2019s\u00a0most\u00a0recognizable\u00a0nickname is \u201cThe Logo\u201d because his iconic silhouette was literally the inspiration for the league\u2019s famous logo. In an NBA career that spanned over\u00a060\u00a0years, West\u00a0had a hand in\u00a0nine NBA championships,\u00a0first\u00a0as a player with the Lakers and\u00a0then as\u00a0an executive for the\u00a0Purple and Gold\u00a0and the Golden State Warriors. West was key in boosting the profile of the Lakers franchise as it relocated from Minneapolis to Los Angeles where the team reached lofty new heights. As a player, West won just one NBA title, but helped establish the Lakers as the Western Conference\u2019s premiere franchise. After his playing days ended, West was instrumental in constructing the \u201cShowtime\u201d Lakers\u00a0\u2013 highlighted by Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, James Worthy and Michael Cooper\u00a0\u2013\u00a0that won five NBA titles in the 1980s. Humble beginnings West was born May 28, 1938, in the small West Virginia town of Chelyan. As a basketball player at East Bank High School in 1956, West was a\u00a0high school\u00a0All-American,\u00a0West\u00a0Virginia\u2019s\u00a0player of the year and led the team to a state championship. After high school, West stayed in his home state to play basketball for West Virginia University. He was named an All-American in 1959 and 1960 and took the Mountaineers to the 1959 Final Four, where he was named the Most Outstanding Player despite his team losing the championship game. In April 1960, West was drafted by the Lakers, who were in the midst of relocating from Minneapolis to Los Angeles to be the NBA\u2019s first team on the West Coast. Before joining the Lakers, West was a member of the USA\u2019s 1960 gold\u00a0medal-winning\u00a0team in the Olympic Games in Rome, Italy.\u00a0 In\u00a02010, as that Olympic team was inducted into the Naismith\u00a0Memorial\u00a0Basketball Hall of Fame, West said,\u00a0\u201cThere\u2019s\u00a0never been a greater thrill in my life than to win a gold medal for our basketball team.\u201d West played 14 NBA seasons as a guard for the Lakers, where he was named an All-Star every season of his career. The Lakers made nine trips to the NBA Finals during his career, but only won a single championship in 1972 against the New York Knicks. West\u2019s Lakers were haunted by the Boston Celtics, who defeated\u00a0their Californian rivals\u00a0six times in the Finals in the 1960s. After yet another loss to Boston in 1969, West was named NBA Finals MVP, the only time a player from the losing team has ever won that award. In 2017, West said in an interview that he hadn\u2019t returned to the city of Boston since his playing career ended and that he was still \u201ctormented\u201d by those losses. How West became \u201cThe Logo\u201d In 1969,\u00a0the NBA commissioned a new logo for the league from designer Alan Siegel, who had famously overseen the design of Major League Baseball\u2019s logo. Siegel, a fan of West, found his inspiration in a photograph of the NBA star\u2019s perfect dribbling form. \u201cIt\u2019s the easiest job I ever had,\u201d Siegel told CNN\u00a0Sport. Siegel has no problem admitting that the NBA logo is based on West, but it\u2019s a different story when it comes to the NBA itself. The league has never formally acknowledged that the logo depicts West. In the NBA\u2019s defense, Siegel says\u00a0that he never told anyone at the league that the logo was modeled after West and never intended for it to be recognizable as the Lakers star. West retired from the NBA in 1974 and was inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame\u00a0as a player\u00a0in 1980. Trophy-laden executive career After West stepped off the court, he transitioned into the Lakers\u2019 front office, where his eye for basketball talent proved as prodigious as his own on-court skill. He assembled the \u201cShowtime\u201d Lakers team that dominated the 1980s led by point guard Magic Johnson. The Lakers made eight Finals appearances and won five championships in that decade, including two against West\u2019s longtime nemesis, the Celtics. In the 1996 NBA offseason, West traded for the rights to rookie Kobe Bryant and acquired free agent Shaquille O\u2019Neal in the span of a single month. This laid the foundation for another dominant Lakers dynasty that won three consecutive NBA championships from 2000 through 2002. After seeing the culmination of his efforts, West retired as executive vice president of the Lakers after the 2000 championship. But West was unable to remain away from the game that had been the focal point of his life for nearly 50 years. In 2002, he joined the front office of the Memphis Grizzlies and went on to win the NBA\u2019s executive of the year award in 2004. Following another brief retirement after leaving the Grizzlies in 2007, West joined the Golden State Warriors in 2011 as an executive and oversaw the team\u2019s NBA titles in 2015 and 2017. He then joined the Los Angeles Clippers as an executive in 2017. It was the\u00a0Clippers that announced West had passed away on Wednesday morning with his wife Karen by his side. In 2019, West was honored for his life\u2019s achievements when he was presented with the Presidential Medal of Freedom by\u00a0then\u00a0President Donald Trump. The Presidential Medal of Freedom is the highest civilian award in the United States. West was married twice and has 5 children, all sons. One of his sons, Ryan, worked in the Lakers\u2019 front office for 10 years before leaving to join his father with the Los Angeles Clippers. Another of his children, Jonnie, is director of basketball operations for the Golden State Warriors and is married to\u00a0former\u00a0professional golfer Michelle Wie West.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/sport/jerry-west-obit-nba-logo-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_europe_jordan-bardella-france-far-right-profile-intl", "text": "At just 28 years old, Jordan Bardella has led the French far right to a landslide victory and humiliated\u00a0President Emmanuel\u00a0Macron\u2019s camp in the European Parliament elections. He\u2019s poised to become the next prime minister if the French president loses his gamble in the upcoming\u00a0snap election. But who is\u00a0far-right doyenne\u00a0Marine Le Pen\u2019s slick prot\u00e9g\u00e9? Bardella, the National Rally party leader, grew up\u00a0an only child\u00a0in social housing in Seine-Saint-Denis, a working-class suburb in the northeast of Paris. He joined the far-right party at 16 and then briefly attended the prestigious Sorbonne university\u00a0in the French capital\u00a0before dropping out. \u201cLike many families, many people who live in these neighborhoods, I was confronted with violence, and my mother struggled to make ends meet. The truth is that the sense of urgency that led me into politics has never left me,\u201d Bardella told\u00a0public television channel\u00a0France 2 in April. In\u00a0clinching 31% of the vote in the European parliamentary election\u00a0\u2013 a record score for the National Rally \u2013 he trounced Macron\u2019s centrist party by a wide margin. \u201cA wind of hope is sweeping across France and it\u2019s only just the beginning,\u201d he said Sunday, as he urged Macron to call a national election \u2013 a bluff the president called, with the first round of voting to take place June 30. Le Pen handpicked the young\u00a0politician to head the party in 2022 \u2013 ending a 50-year-rule by the Le Pen dynasty \u2013 and bring a fresh boost to the French populist right. Hailed as the answer to the National Rally\u2019s attempts to detoxify the party and attract a younger crowd, he helped distance the party from its founder\u00a0and Marine\u2019s father,\u00a095-year-old Holocaust-denier Jean-Marie Le Pen. While Bardella\u00a0continues to try to rid\u00a0the party of its\u00a0antisemitic\u00a0and racist overtones, the populist rhetoric remains\u00a0much\u00a0the same. \u201cWe will act by expelling delinquents, criminals and foreign Islamists who pose a threat to national security,\u201d Bardella said, as he campaigned on promises of limiting free movement of migrants and threats of mass expulsions. Entrenched in the mainstream Bardella\u2019s popularity is proof that what was once unpalatable and reserved to the fringes of French politics is now normalized and entrenched in the mainstream. Voting for the far right is no longer something to be ashamed of in\u00a0much of France. He appeals to the working class, the unemployed and young people in rural areas. On Sunday, 32% of people aged between 18-34 voted for him compared to 5% for the candidate representing Macron\u2019s party, according to an Elabe poll for BFMTV. According to\u00a0political analyst Dominique Moisi, Bardella has\u00a0galvanized a new generation of voters who worry about the future,\u00a0particularly as regards\u00a0jobs and the cost of living, and who believe France has an \u201cidentity crisis.\u201d \u201cThey (the youth) think the\u00a0world is too dangerous and they say we don\u2019t want to be inundated by migrants coming from the Middle East or Africa. We want to be at home,\u201d\u00a0said Moisi. TikTok charm offensive The selfie-taking, clean-shaven Bardella has led a successful charm offensive on TikTok with videos of him\u00a0wine tasting and\u00a0doing shots.\u00a0Even\u00a0something\u00a0as banal as\u00a0him\u00a0eating a\u00a0cereal bar\u00a0racks up thousands of views. His carefully curated social media presence makes him seem familiar and relatable to his 1.5 million followers. He\u2019s known for his videos with brutal put-downs,\u00a0such as\u00a0drinking\u00a0a beer\u00a0with a caption reading \u201cdrinking the tears of Macron fans.\u201d Far-left figurehead Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon has accused Bardella of being all bluster and no substance. \u201cWhat does Mr. Bardella want? We don\u2019t know. He says nothing. He\u2019s a good-looking guy, but what\u2019s his program? Throwing immigrants into the sea.\u201d Critics\u00a0also\u00a0point to Bardella\u2019s\u00a0short career and lack of concrete experience as well as his many absences from the European parliament, to which he was first elected in 2019. Despite his inexperience, Bardella\u2019s ability to rally people behind him was evident this week\u00a0when Eric Ciotti, the\u00a0head of The Republicans, France\u2019s traditional right-wing party, announced a surprise coalition with\u00a0the National Rally for the upcoming legislative elections. The move was immediately attacked by senior members of Ciotti\u2019s own party while Marine Le Pen welcomed the announcement calling it \u201ca brave choice.\u201d Effective political match Bardella \u2013 who dated Le Pen\u2019s niece\u00a0\u2013 has said the two politicians\u00a0have a very trusting relationship. \u201cI\u2019m a loyal, well-behaved boy and I\u2019ll always be her first supporter,\u201d he said. Le Pen, a self-described Bardella groupie, has said she\u2019s always been a great admirer of his and that\u00a0he shows great maturity. The 55-year-old has run for president three times since 2012, made it into the final runoff for the past two, and is largely expected to be a candidate in the next presidential election in 2027. The young Bardella\u2019s electoral success in the European elections look set to help boost that\u00a0ambition. These two deeply political animals, one a fixture of French political life, the other an\u00a0up-and-coming disruptor of it, appear to have found in each other a remarkably efficient political match. It\u2019s\u00a0one that threatens to bring a party long considered too far to the right to be electable to power.

{"id": "2024_04_10_style_graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers", "text": "Climbing up abandoned, unfinished floors and tightrope walking across balcony ledges, backpacks clanging with cans of alkyd and acrylic, a collective of Los Angeles graffiti artists have transformed their craft beyond urban aesthetics to champion community issues. Their choice of canvas: Oceanwide Plaza in Downtown LA. Occupying over a full square city block, the plaza was imagined as a vast mixed-use building project, offering city residents over 500 lavish condominiums, a five-star hotel, retail spaces, restaurants and a private 2-acre park. However, construction on the $1 billion project, which began in 2015, was shelved after the Chinese-backed contractor Oceanwide Holdings ran out of funding\u00a0in 2019 \u2014 and it has lain unfinished ever since. The plaza\u2019s status \u2014 and potential \u2014 as an eye-catching venue for their work spread by word of mouth within the graffiti community in recent months. Security at the site was known to be lax, an important detail as accessing the plaza\u2019s towers and other buildings constitutes trespassing. (The Los Angeles City Attorney confirmed to CNN that, as of April 3, criminal charges have been filed against 23 individuals, for violations including trespassing and possession of vandalism tools.) \u201cIt was like a gift from the graffiti gods\u2026 A giant canvas in the middle of downtown,\u201d tagger ENDEM told CNN, speaking on behalf of himself and his graffiti crew, NCT. \u201cWe were like, \u2018Let\u2019s do it right. Let\u2019s do it as if the whole world is going to see this.\u2019\u201d Historically, graffiti has often been used as protest art. While the practice dates back thousands of years, it\u2019s most commonly viewed in a contemporary context (within graffiti\u2019s \u201cmodern\u201d era, which dates back to the 1960s and 70s) as a creative vehicle for challenging societal norms and inequities \u2014 whether on the Berlin Wall in Germany or subway cars in New York City; whether painted by anonymous artists or well-known figures like Keith Haring or Banksy, even if the latter is, technically, anonymous himself. Still, neither ENDEM nor any of the other artists involved realized how famous their work on the Oceanside towers would become. Sharing his artwork on Instagram on January 31, a video from ENDEM quickly racked up tens of thousands of views: Vibrant images of bright block lettering splayed across the building\u2019s exterior paired with footage from the inside \u2014 the artist posing with shots of his spray paint cans, poised above the cityscape. The viral footage, among other visuals shared on social media, quickly opened the floodgates. Hitting Oceanside became a mark of credibility in the graffiti world; by mid-February, the number of tags and other graffiti pieces there were multiplying overnight. \u201cIt was an open house people going in and out. It was beautiful. It was like graffiti paradise,\u201d ENDEM said. \u201cIt felt exactly like the streets, but concentrated.\u201d Transformed in part into an art installation, Oceanwide became an opportunity for the graffiti artists to leave a message to the city below, and a call-out to policy makers who leave buildings to rot. \u201cGraffiti shows you where the city hurts,\u201d Roger Gastman, owner and founder of the LA-based arts organization Beyond the Streets, told CNN. Renowned for its large-scale exhibitions, immersive educational programs, pop-up events and partnerships, Beyond the Streets works to educate and celebrate the diverse dimensions of graffiti as a medium. To him, the mission of graffiti is clear: to challenge, educate, and redefine public perception of the medium. Earl Ofari Hutchinson, president of The Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable, a nonpartisan public policy forum\u00a0for civic participation and education,\u00a0sees the abandoned towers as amplifying the social issues of the community they are situated in, connecting the graffiti-laden structures to the urban blight that surrounds them in LA\u2019s Skid Row. Skid Row is a 50-block sector of downtown LA where between 8,000 and 11,000 unhoused people live in challenging, often squalid conditions. \u201cYou\u2019ve got tens of thousands of people displaced because of over urban development. And as a result of that, they\u2019re on the streets,\u201d Hutchinson told CNN, noting that the homeless population in Los Angeles is continuing to grow. (The Los Angeles Housing Services Authority reports a 9% increase in homelessness in LA county in 2023 and a 10% increase in the city from 2022.) \u201cNow, set right in the middle of that, you have\u2026 a development that will never be completed.\u201d \u201cWhat you have here is a classic urban nightmare brought on by very poor policies \u2014 fiscal, financial, budgetary and political problems (in) a city that has just gone off the rails in terms of over-development and lack of affordability,\u201d Hutchinson added. Still, Hutchinson is no fan of the graffiti either. To him, and many other LA residents who have said they disapprove of the \u201cvandalism,\u201d the plaza is a sore sight for eyes. \u201cThe problem is you\u2019re talking about violating public space and with no permission\u2026 that doesn\u2019t fly with me,\u201d Hutchinson said. \u201cThe fact of the matter is, the public has not given you approval. (And) the general public has to pay for the removal.\u201d Costs currently borne by the taxpayer at the Oceanwide Plaza site include the security details provided by the LAPD as well as the graffiti cleanup Hutchinson highlights. (\u201cThis has strained our deployment,\u201d LAPD Chief Michel Moore said during a February meeting of the Los Angeles City Council. \u201cWe have called in some officers on an overtime basis so that we can provide for these added patrols or station them at that site to deter vandals and others from gaining access.\u201d) Clean teams working in the neighborhoods surrounding Oceanwide remove on average some 2,000 square feet of graffiti per week, with that figure growing in recent months. \u201cPeople forget that people live here. People own businesses here and they don\u2019t want to have to spend the time and money to clean it up,\u201d said Blair Besten, executive director of the Historic Core of Downtown Los Angeles, an organization which works to improve the quality of life in downtown neighborhoods. The Historic Core prioritizes street sweeping, trash collection \u2014 and graffiti removal. \u201cI would hardly call what they\u2019re doing art,\u201d Besten argued of the Oceanwide taggers. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty sloppy and quick. They come in fast and they knock it out and they leave.\u201d But to Gastman, graffiti is a powerful form of expression, and a call-to-action \u2014 particularly for those who emanate from struggles within home life, gang life or societal turmoil. Graffiti culture can offer an unexpected support system for those the city has abandoned, Gastman said. It becomes a platform for them to make their voices heard. \u201cIn graffiti culture, a lot of us know each other. We\u2019re all friends. We have the same mentality \u2014 we\u2019re just trying to get up. We\u2019re just trying to get noticed,\u201d explained ENDEM. In the midst of an addiction that led to his rock bottom, graffiti became his lifeline, he explained. \u201cI was at my lowest of lows, still trying to stay sober, I needed some type of outlet,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cGraffiti is something that you can hold on to. Its bigger than me, its everyone, it\u2019s a community.\u201d In this, ENDEM believes that the beauty of Oceanwide isn\u2019t tangible. Rather, it lies in the birth of a new generation of graffiti writers. \u201cThey can erase the graffiti on buildings, but they can never erase the impact that it has on the city of Los Angeles and the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to it. Yes, it\u2019s vandalism. Yes, it\u2019s art, and it\u2019s everything in between,\u201d Gastman concluded. \u201cThis is a real culture. It\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/10/style/graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_10_weather_summer-forecast-disasters-fema-climate", "text": "The United States has been rocked by an extraordinary number of tornadoes and devastating storms this year that have already left a staggering price tag. Now heading into what forecasters say will be an extreme summer \u2013 from punishing heat waves to severe weather and hurricanes \u2013 the nation\u2019s disaster relief agency is expected to run out of money before it\u2019s even over. The US has been thrashed with 11 extreme weather disasters with costs exceeding $1 billion so far this year, with a total price tag of $25.1 billion, according to an updated tally from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. It\u2019s tied for the second-most such disasters on record and doesn\u2019t even include the extreme weather in the second half of May, said\u00a0Adam Smith, an applied climatologist with NOAA. That is worrying news for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, whose major disaster relief fund could slip into the red by the end of summer \u2013 a more than $1.3 billion shortfall in August, according to a May report. Florida\u2019s two Republican senators recently wrote a letter to FEMA asking the agency how much more money it would need to respond to hurricane season. In a statement to CNN, a FEMA spokesperson didn\u2019t address exactly how much funding it would need to get through hurricane season, but said the agency is continuing to work with Congress \u201cto ensure sufficient funding is available\ufeff.\u201d \u201cWithout additional funding, FEMA will take steps prior to funding exhaustion to ensure resources are available to support ongoing lifesaving and life sustaining activities,\u201d the spokesperson said. In the event of a major catastrophe like a hurricane, the agency would have a funding reserve set aside for initial response and recovery operations. FEMA\u2019s tenuous balance sheet reflects how many destructive storms have already lashed the US. This spring produced the second-most tornadoes to-date since records began in 1950, according to the Storm Prediction Center. Tornado activity skyrocketed from late April through May, with more than 780 confirmed tornadoes cutting across the central and eastern US during April and May, the SPC said. Some storms have been deadly. An EF4 that ripped through Greenfield, Iowa, killed five. Another tornado in Cooke County, Texas, later in the month killed seven people. Severe thunderstorms have been extremely destructive, with hail wreaking havoc across the central US.\u00a0Severe thunderstorms blasted multiple cities with hurricane-force wind gusts in May. A derecho with 100 mph wind turned debris into projectiles and shattered glass windows in downtown Houston skyscrapers. Nearly a million homes and businesses were left without power, many for days, after violent winds mangled massive electrical transmission towers. And scientists are warning this summer could continue the destruction as the dramatic warming of the planet and oceans from burning fossil fuels set the stage for a supercharged hurricane season and dangerous heat. The climate crisis\u2019 favorite season Summer historically is the season with the most billion-dollar disasters because it is \u201ca transition period of many extremes historically, as the severe storm season continues while the prospect of hurricane season approaches,\u201d Smith said. A chorus of expert voices are calling for an above-average Atlantic hurricane season as anxiety-inducing conditions in the atmosphere and oceans align. Record-breaking ocean heat is expected to\u00a0feed hurricanes, helping them form, strengthen and survive. El Ni\u00f1o is predicted to give way to La Ni\u00f1a and create more favorable atmospheric conditions for storms to thrive. Just about every kind of extreme weather is possible during summer, including more severe thunderstorms. June is the third-most active month for tornadoes in the US, according to the SPC. It\u2019s also the most-active month for destructive and costly severe hail, a 2012 study found. While the connection between hurricanes and climate change is strong, scientists are less sure whether there\u2019s a link to stronger or more frequent tornadoes but are sure it is making heat waves more intense and frequent. Above-average temperatures are expected over nearly every square mile of the Lower 48 this summer, and it began early: It\u2019s already been the hottest start to June on record in Las Vegas, as the West gets hit with a series of early-season heat waves. Prolonged, intense heat dries out soil and can lead to\u00a0drought and billions of dollars in costs due to crop losses. Last year, a series of heat domes seared the South and produced the worst drought on record for Louisiana and one of the state\u2019s worst fire seasons on record. Heat can dry out grass and create a tinderbox for fast-moving wildfires, particularly in the central and western US. California\u2019s fire season could get a late start because of another exceptional wet season, according to Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles. But as heat takes its toll, wildfire activity could \u201creally amp up\u201d in California in late summer as the bounty of grass and brush from the wet season dries out, Swain said. He also highlighted the Great Basin in Nevada and Utah as a spot that normally doesn\u2019t see wildfire but could, due to a \u201chuge proliferation of grass.\u201d According to Swain, wildfire activity could really kick off in late summer, and if that holds up, emergency response could stretch well into the fall. It\u2019s shaping up to be another year of year-round extreme weather.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/weather/summer-forecast-disasters-fema-climate/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_middleeast_sinwar-hamas-israel-ceasefire-hostage-talks-intl", "text": "The military leader of Hamas has said he believes he has gained the upper hand over Israel and that the spiralling civilian death toll in Gaza would work in the militant group\u2019s favor, according to a\u00a0report by the Wall Street Journal, citing leaked messages the newspaper\u00a0said it had seen. \u201cWe have the Israelis right where we want them,\u201d Yahya Sinwar told\u00a0other\u00a0Hamas leaders\u00a0recently, according to one of the messages, the WSJ reported Monday. In another, Sinwar is said to have described civilian deaths as \u201cnecessary sacrifices\u201d while citing past independence-related conflicts in countries like Algeria. The WSJ said it reviewed dozens of messages sent to ceasefire negotiators from Sinwar, who has not been seen in public since Hamas\u2019s October 7 attack on Israel left 1,200 people dead and another 250 taken hostage. The ensuing Israeli assault aimed at eliminating the group has killed more than 37,000 Palestinians in the strip, according to health authorities there. Sinwar\u2019s whereabouts are unknown but he is assumed to be hiding deep underground in Hamas\u2019 labyrinthine tunnel system below Gaza. The messages reported by the WSJ offer a rare glimpse into the mind of the man steering Hamas\u2019 thinking on the war and suggest an uncompromising determination to continue fighting, regardless of the human cost. In another exchange that took place as Israel\u00a0set a deadline\u00a0in February to enter Rafah before the Muslim month of Ramadan, the WSJ reported that Sinwar urged Hamas\u2019 political leaders not to make concessions and instead push for a permanent end to the war,\u00a0adding that high civilian casualties would ramp up global pressure on Israel to halt the conflict. \u201cIsrael\u2019s journey in Rafah won\u2019t be a walk in the park,\u201d Sinwar allegedly said in a message to the Hamas political leadership. CNN has not seen the leaked messages viewed by the WSJ and is not able to confirm the authenticity of the communications. Commenting on the WSJ report, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said on X: \u201cSinwar\u00a0profits off the deaths of Gazan civilians, calling them \u201cnecessary sacrifices\u201d in order to urge international pressure on Israel\u2019s efforts to eliminate his terrorist organization.\u201d Mediators are waiting for a Hamas response to an\u00a0Israeli proposal presented\u00a0by US President Joe Biden last month, which aims to release the hostages in Gaza and implement a lasting ceasefire there. \u2018Waiting on\u2019 Sinwar Sinwar\u2019s alleged comments emerged as US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was on another tour through the Middle East to push all sides to agree to the latest proposal. Speaking from Tel Aviv on Tuesday, Blinken made it clear that the US believes Sinwar is the ultimate decision-maker. \u201cI think there are there those who have influenced, but influence is one thing, actually getting a decision made is the is another thing. I don\u2019t think anyone other than the Hamas leadership in Gaza actually are the ones who can make decisions,\u201d Blinken said, adding that \u201cthat is what we are waiting on.\u201d Blinken said that Hamas\u2019 answer to the proposal will reveal the group\u2019s priorities. \u201cWe await the answer from Hamas in and that will speak volumes about what they want, what they\u2019re looking for, who they\u2019re looking after,\u201d Blinken said. \u201cAre they looking after one guy who may be for now safe \u2026 I don\u2019t know, 10 stories underground somewhere in Gaza, while the people that he purports to represent continue to suffer in a crossfire of his own making? Or will he do what\u2019s necessary to actually move this to a better place, to help end the suffering of people to help bring real security to Israelis and Palestinians alike.\u201d In early messages to ceasefire negotiators, Sinwar seemed \u201csurprised\u201d by the brutality of the October 7 attack on Israel. \u201cThings went out of control,\u201d Sinwar said in one of his messages, according to the WSJ, adding he was \u201creferring to gangs taking civilian women and children as hostages.\u201d \u201cPeople got caught up in this, and that should not have happened,\u201d Sinwar said, according to the WSJ. The US-designated terrorist had also expressed discontent after not being consulted for a meeting between the Hamas political leaders with other Palestinian factions, calling the meeting \u201cshameful and outrageous.\u201d \u201cAs long as fighters are still standing and we have not lost the war, such contacts should be immediately terminated,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cwe have the capabilities to continue fighting for months.\u201d He had also compared the war in Gaza to a 7th-century battle in Karbala, Iraq, a monumental moment in Islamic history where the grandson of the Prophet Mohammed was killed. \u201cWe have to move forward on the same path we started,\u201d Sinwar reportedly wrote. \u201cOr let it be a new Karbala.\u201d On Monday,\u00a014 of the 15 United Nations Security Council\u00a0members voted in favor of a US-drafted resolution around the latest ceasefire proposal, with only Russia abstaining \u2013 the first time the council has endorsed such a plan to end the war. Israel is not a member of the UNSC, and so did not vote. The comprehensive three-stage peace deal, which sets out conditions intended to lead to the eventual release of all remaining hostages, in return for a permanent ceasefire and withdrawal of Israeli forces, was first laid out publicly by US President Biden on May 31. The landmark vote means the UNSC now joins other major global bodies in backing the plan, increasing international pressure on both Hamas and Israel to end the conflict. Hamas welcomed the adoption of the UNSC resolution, saying in a statement it was ready to engage with mediators to implement measures such as the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, prisoner exchange, returning residents to their homes and the \u201crejection of any demographic change or reduction in the area of the Gaza Strip.\u201d The resolution says Israel has accepted the plan, and US officials have repeatedly emphasized Israel had agreed to the proposal \u2013 despite other public comments from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that suggest otherwise.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/middleeast/sinwar-hamas-israel-ceasefire-hostage-talks-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_europe_pope-francis-homophobic-slur-repeat-intl-hnk", "text": "Rome \u2014 The pope has again used a highly disparaging word against gay people for which he had already apologized\u00a0last month, ANSA news agency said on Tuesday. Italian media had attributed to the pope the use of a vulgar Italian term roughly translating as \u201cf*****ry,\u201d on\u00a0May 20\u00a0during a closed-door meeting with Italian bishops. According to ANSA, Francis repeated the term on Tuesday as he met Roman priests, saying \u201cthere is an air of f*****ry in the Vatican,\u201d and it was better that young men with a homosexual tendency not be allowed to enter the seminary. Asked about the latest report, the Vatican\u2019s press office made reference to a statement it had issued regarding Tuesday\u2019s meeting with the priests, in which the pope reiterated the need to welcome gay people into the Church and the need for caution regarding them becoming seminarians. After the initial report of his use of the word, Corriere della Sera newspaper quoted unnamed bishops who were in the room as suggesting that the pope, as an Argentine, might not have realized the Italian term he used was offensive. Last month, a source close to the pope told CNN the phrase could also be understood as there is a \u201cgay climate\u201d in the seminaries. The Vatican ruled in 2005 that the church cannot allow the ordination of men who are actively gay or have \u201cdeep-seated\u201d homosexual tendencies. In 2016, Francis upheld this ruling. Two years later he told Italian bishops not to accept gay candidates for the priesthood. Francis, 87, had been credited with making substantial overtures toward the LGBTQ community during his 11-year papacy. Some observers of the Vatican say his recent missteps undermine his authority and raise questions about his convictions and the reform path he has in mind for the Church.

{"id": "2024_06_11_middleeast_isis-children-detention-syria-intl-cmd", "text": "He had had visitors just once before, years ago when he first arrived in prison at 14. Blindfolded and led into a room by a masked guard, he said he was made to sit on a plastic chair under a cold fluorescent light and questioned by American officials. Stefan Uterloo, now 19, told them he had an uncle in the United States but couldn\u2019t remember where. He suspects they lost interest when they realized he wasn\u2019t American but instead from Suriname, a small, former Dutch colony in South America. Five years later, Uterloo still spends every day with 25 other young men in a single cell in Panorama, a maximum-security prison in northeastern Syria, where CNN interviewed him. Built with funding from the US-led coalition against ISIS and run by the coalition\u2019s ally, the Syrian Democratic Forces or SDF, a Kurdish-led militia, Panorama holds some of the most dangerous ISIS members captured in 2019 after the fall of the group\u2019s so-called caliphate that, at its height, stretched across eastern Syria and western Iraq. Also among the nearly 4,000 ISIS male detainees that the SDF says are held there are an estimated 600 boys and young men detained as boys, according to Amnesty International.\u00a0Like Uterloo, many were brought to Syria, through no fault of their own, by their parents to live under ISIS rule. Now they are coming of age in prison. Many have no idea why they are being held, or what will happen to them. \u201cI don\u2019t know about the big guys,\u201d Uterloo said. \u201cBut if you\u2019re speaking about the kids, and if you want to know the truth, we don\u2019t even know why we are always punished. It\u2019s like five years in this prison \u2026 We don\u2019t even know what we\u2019ve done. We\u2019ve been in prison because of our parents.\u201d The United Nations and rights groups have long warned of the humanitarian and legal crises facing the children of ISIS fighters, who have been kept in camps and detention facilities in northeastern Syria for years. But there has been little consensus on what to do with them. Now, as the US raises the alarm that the militant group is trying to reestablish itself and launch attacks on the West, it is renewing efforts to repatriate fighters and their families to face justice at home. According to Amnesty, the estimated 30,000 children currently held in at least 27 detention facilities and two detention camps \u2013\u00a0Al-Hol and Al-Roj\u00a0\u2013 in northeastern Syria represent the highest concentration of children arbitrarily detained and deprived of their freedom anywhere in the world. CNN was granted extremely rare access inside detention camps and facilities for suspected ISIS fighters and their family members, including Panorama prison. It was the first time the SDF had allowed journalists inside Panorama since 2021 and came just a month after Amnesty released a report accusing the SDF of holding detainees in \u201cinhumane conditions.\u201d The advocacy group cited detainees who said they were subjected to torture and denied access to adequate food and medical care in Panorama, leading to a severe outbreak of tuberculosis inside the prison. The SDF has been quick to dispute the claims of widespread and systematic abuse. Its top commander Mazloum Abdi told CNN that the group\u2019s allegations, \u201care not mirroring the reality.\u201d \u201cInstead of these organizations condemning what we are doing and calling it human rights violations, these organizations should give us help when it comes to our program that we have in place for years,\u201d Mazloum said. In the two cells that CNN was allowed to view under SDF supervision, detainees appeared to be in decent physical condition, sitting cross-legged in clean, recently built, air-conditioned spaces. But the SDF did admit that tuberculosis is rampant in the prison, accounting for five deaths per month, and coughing was audible in the hallways. Officials told CNN that detainees spend up to 23 hours per day in their cells and are held indefinitely without charge. Advocacy groups say the circumstances amount to \u201ca legal black hole,\u201d even worse than the US\u2019 Guantanamo Bay detention facility. \u2018A breeding ground for the next generation of ISIS\u2019 At Al-Hol, a sprawling detention camp of faded tents, rusted barbed wire and wind-swept earth, the scale of the problem reveals itself. There are just over 40,000 people in the camp, where individuals with ISIS affiliations live alongside the displaced, some of them victims of ISIS themselves. A high-security annex holds some 6,700 women and children with links to ISIS fighters from more than 60 countries, who were swept up and dumped in Al-Hol as the SDF cornered and finally defeated the group in its last stronghold, Baghouz in eastern Syria, in 2019. More than half of the camp\u2019s population are children, the majority under 12 years old. Beyond the legal ramifications of their arbitrary and indefinite detention, there are clear security risks as well. Gen. Erik Kurilla, head of the US military\u2019s Central Command, said in a statement after one of his visits to Al-Hol in 2022 that the camp was \u201ca ticking time bomb.\u201d \u201cThis place is a literal breeding ground for the next generation of ISIS,\u201d he said. \u201cThese young people are vulnerable to radicalization given their very poor quality of life.\u201d Speaking to CNN, one senior US government official put it more bluntly: \u201cISIS wants to keep everyone there loyal and primed.\u201d Every month a couple dozen 10- to 15-year-old boys are smuggled out of Al-Hol to ISIS training camps, according to the official. During periodic security raids of Al-Hol, SDF officials say they routinely find cell phone videos of the training, along with horrifying evidence of extrajudicial killings by ISIS supporters. In one video, shared for the first time with CNN, a woman is accused of collaborating with camp administrators. She is beaten and then beheaded inside Al-Hol \u2013 the kind of brutal ISIS extrajudicial punishment that the world hoped it would never see again. The SDF and the US have been pushing countries to repatriate citizens from Syria, telling CNN that it is the only viable solution to this complex and dangerous situation. Al-Hol\u2019s population has been reduced by 42% from a peak of over 73,000 in 2019, according to US officials who say the process has been too slow and many, including close allies which can more easily revoke citizenship than the US, are still dragging their feet. \u201cIt\u2019s unhelpful,\u201d the senior US official told CNN. Complicating matters, the bulk of the camp\u2019s detainees are from countries without any allegiance to the US-led coalition, among them Russians, Chinese Uyghurs and Syrians from regime-held areas, making the prospect of permanently closing Al-Hol unrealistic, at least for now. At the current rate of repatriation, officials say it will at least take an additional seven years to halve the camp\u2019s current population. Taken from their mothers at night As a stopgap, the SDF has introduced an official policy that separates boys at 14 from their mothers, placing them in two purpose-built facilities that it calls \u201crehabilitation\u201d centers. CNN met children as young as 11 in one of the centers, suggesting that camp officials are going beyond that policy. One woman in Al-Hol claimed her 10-year-old son was detained for trying to escape the camp, and that boys are often taken away at age 12. The SDF says the policy is necessary to stop boys from being radicalized by their mothers and to prevent the next generation of ISIS fighters from being born in the camps. They point to the 60 births per month recorded at Al-Hol as proof that young boys are already being married off. But the policy is an absolute breach of international law, according to former UN Special Rapporteur on counterterrorism and human rights Fionnuala N\u00ed Aol\u00e1in. \u201cIt runs us into the area of a war crime,\u201d\u00a0N\u00ed Aol\u00e1in\u00a0told CNN. \u201cThere\u2019s no legal process to justify it \u2026 you must have a court process and taking the child away from a mother is an absolute last resort, when you\u2019ve tried everything else. And it\u2019s neither a last resort nor a legal process, it\u2019s generally a pretty violent, arbitrary process.\u201d \u201cNo one is disputing that the situation in Al-Hol is both suboptimal, dangerous, inappropriate to children, with exposure to structural and direct violence, but it\u2019s also not taking responsibility for the very existence of those camps,\u201d she added. The alternative, say SDF officials, is far worse. Compared to Al-Hol, the Orkesh \u201crehabilitation\u201d center, where some boys and young men are detained, seems like a sanctuary. Its inner courtyard is dominated by a soccer field, where nearly every morning before the day\u2019s blazing heat sets in, Shamil Chakar takes to goal. Chakar is hard to miss. The tall, lanky teenager,\u00a0originally from Cologne, Germany, was taken by his parents to the former capital of ISIS\u2019 self-declared caliphate, Raqqa. He moves with ease on the field, but a shrapnel injury, a large scar from which is still visible on his head, has left him confused. When he sits down to talk, he doesn\u2019t know his own age. But the memory of the night he was taken from Al-Hol by SDF security forces is fresh. \u201cA man came and pulled me up and tied my hand behind my back,\u201d Shamil said. \u201cMy mom was screaming, she said \u2018leave him alone.\u2019 I didn\u2019t want to go with them. He pushed me, saying put on your shoes, but I didn\u2019t. Then he hit me.\u201d Other boys have similar stories of violent separation. All miss their mothers. But their lives have also changed dramatically. At the center, they have rooms with beds, three meals per day and psychological support five days a week. \u2018I would choose an American prison any day\u2019 Second chances are nearly impossible to come by. For those in detention, repentance is demanded, and forgiveness rarely given. But when it does happen, it\u2019s at Al-Roj camp. It is much smaller and more manageable than Al-Hol, and it is where international detainees are transferred before repatriation. In early May, 50-year-old American Brandy Salman and her nine children, aged 7 to 26, along with two young sons of a Minnesota man, left Al-Roj in what was one of the largest repatriations back to the US to date. Roughly a dozen Americans remain in Al-Roj, according to US officials, who are seeking to bring them back. But for now, Hoda Muthana, an American-born woman, isn\u2019t one of them. She has been stuck in Al-Roj for more than five years with her now 7-year-old son. She\u2019s well-known in the camp for being outspoken. She doesn\u2019t wear a face veil and scrawled F-ISIS on the wall outside her tent. Raised in Alabama, she left her family at the age of 20 to live under ISIS after having been drawn in by the group\u2019s propaganda on social media. She became a noted ISIS propagandist herself, cheering their attacks in posts on Twitter, now X, and calling on others to join the self-declared caliphate. Muthana denies personally posting the tweets, telling CNN her phone was taken when she joined ISIS, a decision she deeply regrets. As her son grows older, nearing the age of the forced separation policy, she lives in constant fear for his future. Her American lawyers are continuing to push for her repatriation and that of her son, after the Trump administration revoked her passport on a technicality in 2019 and said that she was not a citizen. Left with few remaining options after the Supreme Court refused to hear her appeal, her legal team has directly petitioned the State Department for a certificate of identity to prove her status. A State Department spokesperson told CNN it had not changed its position regarding Muthana\u2019s citizenship status.\u00a0\u201cHoda Muthana is not a US citizen.\u00a0As the State Department determined and the courts agreed, she is not and never was a US citizen. For privacy reasons, we are unable to provide further comment,\u201d the spokesperson said. Muthana\u2019s lawyer Christina Jump told CNN the department\u2019s stance is hypocritical at best and dishonest at worst. \u201cThe\u00a0US has taken a high and mighty approach in lecturing other countries that they need to repatriate.\u00a0If Hoda Muthana is not a US citizen, then she is stateless and that is a violation of international law and that directly contradicts what the US government has stated that other countries cannot and should not do,\u201d Jump said. \u201cThey also are ignoring completely that at the very least there is a grandchild of US citizens who remains in that camp that they have known about for years now.\u201d Inside a tent surrounded by her son\u2019s toys and books, Muthana told CNN that all she wanted was to go home to the US, even if it meant being in prison. \u201cIf I had any time to serve, I would serve it and I would come out and begin my life with my son,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I were to have the choice between American prison and this camp, I would choose an American prison any day.\u201d CreditsVideo journalist: Scott McWhinnieVideo editors: Oscar Featherstone and Augusta Anthony\ufeffGraphics editor: Lou RobinsonPhoto editor: Sarah TilottaEditors: Eliza Mackintosh and Laura Smith-Spark", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/middleeast/isis-children-detention-syria-intl-cmd/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_10_tech_hospital-cyberattack-google-microsoft", "text": "Microsoft and Google will offer free or discounted cybersecurity services to rural hospitals across the United States to make them less vulnerable to cyberattacks that have disrupted patient care and threatened lives, the White House and those tech firms said Monday. Microsoft said in a statement to CNN that it would provide free security updates for eligible rural hospitals, as well as security assessments and training for hospital staff. Google will provide free cybersecurity advice to rural hospitals and start a pilot program to match the firm\u2019s cybersecurity services with the needs of rural hospitals. The nation\u2019s roughly 1,800 rural community hospitals are among the most vulnerable to dangerous ransomware attacks because they often lack IT security resources and cybersecurity-trained staff. And they may be the only hospitals within dozens of miles, meaning a ransomware attack that prevents a hospital from accepting ambulances can put patients\u2019 lives at risk. The new announcement is\u00a0the result of private discussions between the tech firms and officials at the White House National Security Council who have growing increasingly concerned about cyber threats to hospitals. It\u2019s an effort to use the broad reach of Microsoft and Google\u2019s software, which is used in hospitals across the United States, to help plug a gap in the defense of the health care sector. \u201cWe\u2019re in new territory as we see \u2026 this wave of attacks against hospitals,\u201d Anne Neuberger, the top cyber official at the White House National Security Council, told reporters on Sunday. The Biden administration is also preparing to issue minimum cybersecurity requirements for US hospitals. The details of that proposal have yet to be finalized. But the American Hospital Association, which represents hospitals across the United States, opposes the proposal, saying it would impose penalties on the victims of cyberattacks after they are hacked. A growing problem The number of ransomware attacks against the US healthcare sector increased by 128% in 2023 compared to 2022,\u00a0according to data\u00a0released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. And recent ransomware attacks have brought the sector\u2019s vulnerability into sharp relief. A February ransomware attack on a major health insurance billing firm\u00a0cut off health providers\u00a0from billions of dollars and put some health clinics on the brink of bankruptcy. UnitedHealth Group, whose subsidiary was hacked, paid a $22 million ransom to the hackers to try to recover patient data. One third of Americans may have had their data stolen. Another ransomware attack, in May, on one of America\u2019s largest hospital chains,\u00a0put patients\u2019 lives in danger\u00a0as nurses were forced to manually enter prescription information, multiple nurses at affected hospitals told CNN. The FBI and its international allies have conducted a series of crackdowns on ransomware gangs, seizing the computers they use and unlocking some of the victim computers that hackers have encrypted. But ransomware remains a flourishing business, in part, US officials say, because many of its perpetrators operate with impunity from Russia. The health care sector is a particularly enticing target because hospitals under duress to restore patient services\u00a0are sometimes willing\u00a0to pay the ransom. \u201cWe do see a much more permissive environment in Russia by both hacktivists and criminals, and it\u2019s of concern,\u201d Neuberger, the White House official, told reporters. \u201cWe also see more and more companies paying ransoms. And every ransom payment feeds the beast and drives further attacks.\u201d Cleveland cyberattack shuts City Hall Cyberattacks have frequently shut down other vulnerable services. The\u00a0City of Cleveland is\u00a0investigating a cyber incident, according to a statement from mayor Justin\u00a0Bibb. As a precaution, the city said it closed City Hall Monday, and it will keep City Hall closed Tuesday. Cleveland also shut down all of its internal systems and software. But city and emergency services like the Department of Public Safety, 911, police, the fire department, ambulances and the Department of Public Utilities, will remain operational, Bibb\u2019s office said. However, the mayor said the emergency services are functioning with limited IT capabilities. \u201cOver the weekend, the city identified some abnormalities,\u201d Commissioner Kimberly\u00a0Roy-Wilson, with the city\u2019s Division of Information Technology Services, said. \u201cWe have moved into our protocols and procedures with regards to containment and we are now investigating the nature and scope of those abnormalities.\u201d Bibb would not say how many or which agencies are helping with the investigation.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/tech/hospital-cyberattack-google-microsoft/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "world"}}
