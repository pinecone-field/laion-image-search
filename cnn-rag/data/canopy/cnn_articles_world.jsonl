The death toll rose Friday evening from the four fatalities officials reported earlier in the day. More than 900,000 homes and businesses lost power in Houston\u2019s Harris County during the peak of the storm\u2019s violent winds, and nearly 600,000 remained in the dark Friday evening, according to PowerOutage.us. \u201cFor some folks, the luckier ones, (power restoration) might be days, not hours. For many, many people, it\u2019s going to be weeks and not days,\u201d Harris County Judge Lina Hildago said in a Friday news briefing. Hidalgo said the weeks-long restoration timeframe was for homes and businesses tied into the 10 steel power transmission towers downed in the state, seven of which were in Harris County. It\u2019s unclear which areas are tied into the transmission lines, she said. It\u2019s a troubling timeframe for power restoration, especially as high temperatures reach the 90s through the weekend and beyond. The heat index, which measures what the body actually feels, could hit the triple-digits by next week, raising health risks from weather\u2019s deadliest threat. The City of Houston planned to activate cooling centers for residents on Friday, officials said in a news release. Fallen trees appear to have caused two of the reported deaths, and a crane accident caused another, Houston Fire Department Chief Samuel Pe\u00f1a said in a news conference. The Harris County Sheriff\u2019s Office on Friday evening identified three others in the county who died from the storm. One man collapsed while attempting to move a downed electrical pole, and a woman died after lightning struck the trailer she was inside and caused a fire, Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said in a post on X Friday. Gonzales said another victim who had lost power reportedly went out to his truck to plug in his oxygen tank. \u201cHe was found unresponsive this morning and pronounced deceased at the scene,\u201d the sheriff said Friday, adding the additional deaths occurred in unincorporated Harris County. Houston Mayor John Whitmire, who signed a local state of disaster declaration for the city on Friday, toured the downtown area and said the \u201cdevastation is significant.\u201d \u201cWe urge everyone to stay away from the area for your safety and to allow public works personnel to do their vital jobs,\u201d Whitmire said.  Additional powerful, drenching storms could plague parts of the Gulf Coast Friday. Here\u2019s the latest on Friday\u2019s storms and destruction in Texas and other parts of the South: Thursday\u2019s severe weather classified as derecho: The weather service classified the line of severe storms that moved through Texas and Louisiana as a derecho, a potentially destructive weather event characterized by widespread wind damage associated with a long-lived line of thunderstorms. Derechos have consistent wind gusts of 58 mph or greater along a path of at least 400 miles, along with several well-separated wind gusts of greater than 75 mph. The Storm Prediction Center and several National Weather Service offices made the determination based on the path\u2019s length and intensity. Most of Houston\u2019s traffic lights are down: Traffic lights across the city are out and debris from damaged buildings and toppled trees are covering roadways, making driving conditions dangerous. \u201cDowntown is a mess. It\u2019s dangerous due to the glass and the lack of traffic lights. So stay at home,\u201d Mayor Whitmire said Thursday. Hurricane-force wind gusts reported in Texas and Louisiana: Wind speeds reached as high as 100 mph in downtown Houston, a National Weather Service storm damage survey crew determined Friday. Wind gusts of 74 to 78 mph were measured just east of the Houston metro\u00a0Thursday evening,\u00a0according to the weather service. The National Weather Service in New Orleans reported wind gusts as strong as 84 mph around the city. Major flooding leads to water rescues: There were up to 20 water rescues after residents in Bryan, Texas, drove into the floodwaters, police spokesperson Seth Waller said. Nearby in College Station, heavy rain Thursday flooded a park, videos shared with CNN showed. Roads flooded in several Texas counties including Bosque, Bell, McLennan and Falls. Waterlogged parts of Texas and Louisiana recorded widespread rainfall amounts of 2 to 4 inches in just a few hours late Thursday and early Friday morning. Spate of storms exhausts Texas: The Lone Star State has been in the bull\u2019s-eye of seemingly unrelenting rounds of flooding downpours. Gov. Greg Abbott on Wednesday requested a presidential disaster declaration for areas impacted by the onslaught of severe weather and flooding, citing \u201cextensive damage caused by these severe storms, historic river flooding, and tornadoes\u201d that began on April 26. Houston area bears brunt of destructive storms Houston\u2019s mayor advised residents to stay off the roads and stay at home because of widespread damage to the area. \u201cMany roads are impassable due to downed power lines, debris, and fallen trees,\u201d Mayor Whitmire\u2019s office said in a statement Thursday evening. The storm was so powerful it blew out the windows of buildings in downtown Houston, littering the area with glass as traffic lights went dark. Shoppers at a Costco in Houston used their phones as the only source of light as they huddled inside the store when the power went out, with employees closing the doors to block out the rain and winds. The violent storm conditions partially collapsed a nightclub and partially ripped roofing off the downtown Hyatt Regency, showering the hotel lobby with rain and debris, according to witness video. CenterPoint Energy says its skyscraper in downtown Houston sustained damage from the storm, according to a spokesperson. The Houston Independent School District announced campuses will be closed on Friday and reopen Monday \u201cdue to widespread damage across Houston.\u201d More than a dozen Houston-area school districts also announced they would close Friday, including Aldine Independent School District, Channelview Independent School District and Cypress-Fairbanks Independent School District. More damaging storms possible Friday Damaging, soaking storms were ongoing in parts of the Gulf Coast Friday morning following Thursday night\u2019s violent weather. Additional storms will usher in renewed threats later Friday. A Level 2 of 5 risk of severe thunderstorms is in place from southern Louisiana to parts of Georgia and Florida. Any of these storms could produce damaging wind gusts, hail and even a tornado. Storms will also unload gushing rainfall. A Level 3 of 4 risk of flooding rainfall is in place for portions of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. The heaviest rain late Friday will likely fall during the overnight hours. Storms could produce rainfall rates of 2 to 3 inches per hour and quickly restart or worsen any ongoing flooding. Widespread rainfall totals of 2 to 6 inches are expected from Texas to Georgia through Saturday morning. A few spots caught under multiple torrential storms may pick up 8 inches or more of rain. Some areas could record close to a foot of rain in about 48 hours.

{"id": "2024_05_13_europe_russia-surging-on-frontlines-analysis-intl", "text": "The changing language used by the Ukrainian military in 72 hours of daily updates tells the story: \u201cOngoing defensive fighting.\u201d \u201cSignificantly worsened.\u201d Russian \u201ctactical success.\u201d You rarely ever hear Kyiv\u2019s top brass sounding downbeat, but their steep southerly trajectory reflects the grave place Ukraine finds itself in. Russia is not just advancing slowly in one place; it appears to be advancing in four,\u00a0across the frontline. Moscow knows it is on the clock: in about a month, the $61billion of US military aid will start to translate into Ukraine having the weapons it has been begging for. So,\u00a0Russian President Vladimir Putin\u00a0seems to be throwing whatever he can at it, knowing the fight will likely\u00a0only\u00a0get tougher for his forces in the summer ahead. First, and most acutely troubling, is the northern border near Kharkiv,\u00a0Ukraine\u2019s second city. Russian forces have crossed the border in multiple locations and claim to have seized nine villages. Their move\u00a03 to 4.5 miles (5 to 7 kilometers)\u00a0into Ukraine, in the border area above Ukraine\u2019s second city of Kharkiv, is arguably their fastest advance since the first days of the war. Russia has thrown five battalions at the border town of Vovchansk, Ukrainian officials said, which has been hit hard by airstrikes over the weekend. The town of Lyptsi is at risk, say some military bloggers,\u00a0and\u00a0from\u00a0there\u00a0Russian forces could hit Kharkiv with artillery. This is a nightmare for Kyiv for two reasons: firstly, they liberated this land from Russian forces 18 months ago, yet failed, clearly, to fortify the area enough to prevent Moscow sweeping\u00a0back\u00a0with the ease\u00a0with which\u00a0they were swept out. And secondly, Russia can again tie up Ukraine\u2019s over-stretched army with constant and grinding pressure on Kharkiv, exacting a toll with crude shelling on a vast urban center. Then there is the rest of the front, where progress in Kharkiv region has been mirrored by old, exhausting fights suddenly seeing new Russian success. This should be the greatest cause for concern to Kyiv, as it suggests a coordinated bid to push in all directions and leave\u00a0Ukrainian\u00a0President Volodymyr Zelensky with ugly choices about where to send limited resources, and where ultimately to sacrifice. Moving\u00a0slowly south from Kharkiv, closer to Bakhmut, the town of Chasiv Yar has been under intense pressure \u2013 a valuable height above two key Ukrainian military towns, Kramatorsk and Sloviansk, which could prove an exhaustive pressure point over the summer on Kyiv\u2019s supply lines. Netailove and Krasnohorivka slightly\u00a0further\u00a0south show Russian forces making further gains to the west of Avdiivka, and threatening another key hub \u2013 Pokrovsk. If Ukraine begins to fall back further here, its grip on the remnants of Donetsk region could be at risk. And then overnight, Deep State Map, a Ukrainian military analysis group, said the southern village of Verbove was under greater threat \u2013 one of\u00a0the\u00a0minimal gains from Kyiv\u2019s stymied summer counteroffensive\u00a0last year. All across the board, the news is bad: it is a growing calamity. Ukraine\u2019s rhetorical response has been telling.\u00a0Its leaders\u00a0have, for once, openly said how bad it is. They appear to be shuffling commanders around \u2013 which is not something you do in the heat of battle without desperate reason. There is vocal criticism of the failure to prepare and fortify the northern border regions over the past year. Indeed, along much of the front line where there is not active fighting, and in the near-rear to active frontlines, fortifications seem wanting, if not entirely absent. It may be\u00a0that\u00a0Kyiv believed so much in its counteroffensive last summer, that\u00a0it failed to entertain the idea of bad news this summer. Kyiv\u2019s larger problem is global attention. Trenchant statements from European ministers, and even visits from senior Biden\u00a0administration\u00a0officials, cannot cut through the fatigue or the notion that helping Ukraine win is something governments see they strategically must do, rather than something their publics actively demand. It is becoming a war the world wishes would go away \u2013 side-lined by the horrors of the Middle East \u2013 exactly when its outcome is most perilous and vital for European security. Putin used the weekend to reshuffle some of his cabinet \u2013 moving Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu to a more procedural role as National Security Council head, and perhaps further away from the wartime cookie jar. An accountant, Andrey Belousov, will take his place. But this is not necessarily a sign of retribution for failure, or a reset: the same old boys still get nice jobs. It smacks more of Moscow economizing, integrating the war more fully into the economy, and settling in for the longer haul. The opposite is happening in the West, where\u00a0the\u00a0congressional dysfunction pausing\u00a0that\u00a0paused\u00a0the US\u2019s $61 billion in aid has already wreaked havoc on Ukraine\u2019s military effort. Its forces\u00a0are losing\u00a0now because of that six-month delay in ammunition\u00a0reaching them. Europe talks big about making up the gap, but it cannot. And Washington DC will now be in a whirlwind of electioneering\u00a0ahead of the US elections in November\u00a0just when Kyiv needs\u00a0American\u00a0certainty most. The news is not just bad, it is worsening daily. The ground on the front lines is drying\u00a0out, bringing us into the season to attack. Russia has momentum unlike anything\u00a0seen\u00a0since March 2022. Ukraine is being forced to admit just how bad\u00a0the\u00a0situation\u00a0is. Much of the world may be tiring of this war, but Putin is not.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/europe/russia-surging-on-frontlines-analysis-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_13_europe_catalonia-elections-socialists-win-intl", "text": "Barcelona, Spain \u2014 Spain\u2019s Socialists won the biggest share of the vote in Sunday\u2019s Catalan elections, dealing a serious blow to more than a decade of separatist governance and the independence dreams still nursed by some in the wealthy northeastern region. The Socialists, led locally by Salvador Illa, had 42 seats in the 135-seat chamber with more than 99% of the vote counted, while hardline separatist party Junts was in second place with 35 seats, and the incumbent more moderate separatist party Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (ERC) had 20 seats. Spain\u2019s largest opposition party, the conservative People\u2019s Party, also had a good night, seeing the biggest increase since the last vote in 2021 from three seats to 15 on Sunday. Turnout for the vote was notably low at 58%. The result looks to be an existential threat for separatist governance in Catalonia which led a 2017 illegal independence referendum and declaration of independence that caused Spain\u2019s worst institutional crisis in more than 30 years but whose movement has lost energy and unity more recently. It also represents a vindication of Spain\u2019s Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez\u2019s controversial bid to normalize relations with restive Catalonia, including issuing pardons for convictions over the independence drive and, more recently, a controversial amnesty including others still facing prosecution. Speaking as the voting count concluded, Illa hailed a \u201cnew era\u201d for the region. However, with no party holding a clear majority and deep ideological divisions between them, there remains the risk the vote will have to be repeated. The separatist parties combined of the ERC, Junts, far-left CUP and far-right Alianca Catalana, do not have the required 68 seats to be able to form a coalition government. Illa\u2019s Socialists will also need to forge an agreement - most likely with the ERC - but separatist parties until now have rejected any suggestion of helping the national ruling party govern in Catalonia. Illa might instead attempt to form an unorthodox alliance with not only far-left Sumar, its coalition partner in national government, but also the conservative People\u2019s Party and far-right Vox, with whom the socialists have long said they would not negotiate. On Sunday night, the ERC\u2019s leader Pere Aragones, Catalonia\u2019s outgoing president, told reporters that his party would move into opposition, effectively ruling out backing the Socialists. Junts\u2019 leader Carles Puigdemont said his party had performed well but turnout among separatist voters remained low and without a strong showing by the ERC, AC and CUP, his options were limited. He previously said that if he didn\u2019t win and the Socialists allied with the PP to lead the region he might withdraw his support from its minority national government - offered after inconclusive national elections in July, risking fresh instability on a national level. Political analyst and historian Joan Esculies said whatever came next, the night\u2019s headline was the tamping down of Catalan separatist sentiment: \u201cThe pro-independence movement has run out of ideas to convince or mobilize people as they did before.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/europe/catalonia-elections-socialists-win-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_17_africa_tiwa-savage-water-and-garri-nigeria-spc", "text": "Despite her extraordinary success in Afrobeats music, Tiwa Savage has long harbored a secret aspiration: to pursue a career in acting. \u201cActing, I would say, was my first love before music,\u201d she told CNN\u2019s Larry Madowo during a recent interview in Lagos. At 44, the multifaceted, award-winning Nigerian artist has transformed her dreams into reality. On May 10, her much-anticipated debut film, \u201cWater & Garri,\u201d hit Prime Video, marking her leap into acting. Executive produced by Savage and directed by her long-time music video director Meji Alabi, \u201cWater & Garri\u201d is a collaboration between Everything Savage, Unbound Studios, and JM Films. The concept was born from Savage\u2019s idea to create a visual album for her 2021 EP of the same name. Because of that, it \u201cinitially it was only supposed to be like a short film,\u201d Savage said, \u201cand then it grew on its own and took its own identity.\u201d Written by Comfort Emmanuel, the film is set in a fictional town on the Cape Coast of Ghana and follows a determined fashion designer named Aisha (Savage) who returns to her hometown due to a family tragedy after a decade in the US. However, upon her return home, she finds her once familiar surroundings altered by escalating violence and heightened tensions. As she reconnects with her family, old friends, and a former flame, Aisha must confront her past and face the guilt of what she left behind \u2013 an experience Savage says drew parallels to her own life. \u201cWe both felt like we had to go somewhere to chase our dreams,\u201d said Savage, who spent two weeks in intensive training in London to prepare for the role of Aisha. \u201cIt was just to break me out of my shell, to break me out of Tiwa Savage and just empty me out \u2013 and then just allow me to be or embody like a whole different character,\u201d she added. Experimenting with a new sound As the production of the film pressed forward, Savage didn\u2019t only shed her superstar persona, she moved on from the initial musical inspiration for the film, instead opting to create an original soundtrack for the movie. \u201cIt was supposed to include the first five songs on the EP; by the time we finished filming, it just took on a whole different identity, and we just created a whole new soundtrack,\u201d the singer explained. The album served as a platform for Savage to push her vocal boundaries and delve into new musical genres. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve been boxed to a certain sound because I\u2019ve done it for over 10 years,\u201d Savage said. The 10-song soundtrack included collaborations with French Nigerian singer Asa on the folk song \u201cEmotions,\u201d\u00a0American gospel artist Zacardi Cortez on \u201cI Need You,\u201d and Richard Bona & The Cavemen on the jazz track \u201cWater & Garri.\u201d \u201cCreating the soundtrack allowed me to explore those different genres, and I think I didn\u2019t feel like I would have been able to do that as Tiwa Savage,\u201d she said. \u201c(So) I was able to explore those pockets of my talent.\u201d \u00a0 The singer admits she has always loved Jazz, R&B, and gospel music, but after acting in \u201cWater & Garri\u201d and performing the soundtrack, she says has discovered how much she has grown as an artist and feels encouraged to be limitless in her creativity. \u201cI\u2019m not limiting myself to the sound that people know me for; I\u2019ve definitely grown even in a performance \u2013 like I used to have a lot of dances and do routines,\u201d the singer-turned-actress explained. \u201cNow I think I\u2019m more about vocal delivery,\u201d she added. \u201cGoing forward from that \u2026 I feel like I can do anything.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/africa/tiwa-savage-water-and-garri-nigeria-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_world_cotton-candy-exoplanet-discovery-wasp-193b-scn", "text": "What is big, with a fluffy,\u00a0cotton candy-like composition? Turns out, a planet. An international coalition of astronomers has newly discovered an unusual planet, dubbed WASP-193b, that\u2019s about 50% bigger than Jupiter and somehow still the second lightest planet ever found. But WASP-193b, located beyond our solar system about 1,200 light-years from Earth, isn\u2019t just a scientific oddity. The exoplanet could also be key to future research investigating atypical planetary formation, according to a study describing the find that published Tuesday in the journal Nature Astronomy. This cotton candy planet isn\u2019t alone; there are other similar planets belonging to a class scientists facetiously call \u201cpuffy Jupiters.\u201d The lightest planet ever discovered is the superpuffy Kepler 51d, which is nearly the size of Jupiter but a hundred times lighter than the gas giant. Puffy Jupiters have largely been a mystery for 15 years, said lead study author Khalid Barkaoui. But WASP-193b, because of its size, is an ideal candidate for further analysis by the James Webb Space Telescope and other observatories. \u201cThe planet is so light that it\u2019s difficult to think of an analogous, solid-state material,\u201d said Barkaoui, a postdoctoral researcher of Earth, atmospheric and planetary sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in a news release. \u201cThe reason why it\u2019s close to cotton candy is because both are mostly made of light gases rather than solids. The planet is basically super fluffy.\u201d Low-density planet presents big challenge WASP-193b, which researchers think is made up of mostly hydrogen and helium, was a huge puzzle for researchers to piece together. Because the exoplanet\u2019s density is so light for its size, calculating its mass became a challenge. Usually, scientists determine mass using a technique called radial velocity, in which researchers analyze how a star\u2019s spectrum, a graph that indicates the intensity of light emissions in wavelengths, shifts as a planet orbits it. The bigger the planet, the more the star\u2019s spectrum can shift \u2014 but this didn\u2019t work for WASP-193b, which is so light, it didn\u2019t make any pull on the star that the team could detect. Because of how small the mass signal was, it took the team four years to gather data and calculate WASP-193b\u2019s mass, Barkaoui explained. Because the extremely low numbers they found were so rare, the researchers completed multiple trials of data analysis, just to be sure. \u201cWe were initially getting extremely low densities, which were very difficult to believe in the beginning,\u201d said co-lead author Francisco Pozuelos, a senior researcher at Spain\u2019s Institute of Astrophysics of Andalucia, in a news release. Eventually the team discovered the planet\u2019s mass is a measly 14% that of Jupiter, despite being so much bigger. But a bigger size means a bigger \u201cextended atmosphere,\u201d said study coauthor Julien de Wit, an associate professor of planetary science at MIT. That means WASP-193b provides an especially useful window into these puffy planets\u2019 formation. \u201cThe bigger a planet\u2019s atmosphere, the more light can go through,\u201d de Wit told CNN. \u201cSo it\u2019s clear that this planet is one of the best targets we have for studying atmospheric effects. It will be a Rosetta Stone to try and resolve the mystery of puffy Jupiters.\u201d But it\u2019s also not clear how WASP-193b even formed, Barkaoui said. The \u201cclassical evolution models\u201d of gas giants don\u2019t quite explain the phenomenon. \u201cWASP-193b is an outlier of all planets discovered to date,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/world/cotton-candy-exoplanet-discovery-wasp-193b-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "world"}}

There\u2019s the Art Deco curved crown of the Chrysler Building, the sweeping isosceles triangles that twist around One World Trade Center, the stepped limestone and granite rectangles of the Empire State Building and the triangular prism of the Flatiron Building. And now, a multi-billion-dollar tower featuring floor-to-ceiling glass will add another dimension to the cityscape, according to new details unveiled by New York City Mayor Eric Adams this week. Stretching up 62 stories, a planned office tower at 350 Park Avenue will provide space for more than 6,000 jobs, plus 1.8 million square feet of commercial office space, according to a press release. It will be funded by Vornado Realty Trust, Kenneth Griffin, founder and CEO of global investment firm Citadel, and building and management company Rudin. White columns will frame a new public concourse at the base of the new building on Park Avenue, complete with green space, seating and art displays, images show. Above, landscaped terraces will top each section of the glass-clad tower which will house the offices for Citadel and market making firm Citadel Securities. Adams hailed the project in the release, saying it will help \u201csupercharge our economy and expand New York City\u2019s iconic skyline,\u201d building on \u201ccontinued efforts to energize Midtown Manhattan as the world\u2019s most important business address and an economic engine for working-class New Yorkers.\u201d Architects Foster + Partners have designed the building, which will replace the existing 30-story tower currently at the site in Midtown Manhattan just a few blocks away from landmarks like the Rockefeller Center, St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral and Grand Central Station. As New York continues to deal with the economic aftershocks wrought by the Covid-19 pandemic, Adams and his administration said in their respective statements that they hoped this project would continue the city\u2019s recovery. \u201cThis investment opens a new chapter for Midtown \u2014 and closes the book on those who predicted its demise,\u201d said deputy mayor for operations Meera Joshi. \u201cMidtown\u2019s revitalization is being led by its public realm \u2014 including investments in Fifth Avenue, with the crown jewels of Central Park and Bryant Park at either end. Together, with our business improvement district and parks partners, we are reintroducing Fifth Avenue to the world and creating a vibrant live, work, play community for a new era,\u201d Joshi added. Building this new office space comes at a fraught time for the commercial real estate market as businesses struggle to entice workers back to the office after years of working from home.

{"id": "travel_airplane-spotted-passenger-overhead-bin", "text": "Airplane overhead compartments. Home to luggage of all shapes and sizes, the odd coat or two, several duty-free bags, a fair bit of dust and\u2026 passengers? Last week, a video was posted on TikTok appearing to depict a traveler on a Southwest Airlines flight peering out from inside an overhead locker. The clip quickly spread across social media, although the original TikTok seems to have since been deleted. It\u2019s not the first time a video like this has hit the internet. In 2019, a flight attendant \u2013 also on a Southwest flight \u2013 was captured on film poking their head out of an overhead compartment. At the time, the airline released a statement saying the crew member was enjoying \u201ca brief moment of fun,\u201d before confirming \u201cthis is not our normal procedure.\u201d A Southwest representative told CNN Travel the airline was also \u201caware\u201d of last week\u2019s locker incident and is currently \u201clooking into it.\u201d Not a \u2018certifiable place for passengers\u2019 Given passengers are advised to stay in their seats for the duration of a plane journey \u2013 usually with their seatbelt fastened \u2013 it should go without saying that climbing into the overhead locker is a bad idea. As British flight attendant Kris Major tells CNN Travel, the overhead bin is \u201cnot a certifiable place to be as a passenger.\u201d \u201cIf we encountered turbulence they could get hurt \u2013 if they got blown out they could really get hurt and they could also hurt someone underneath them,\u201d says Major, adding that a passenger in an overhead bin also wouldn\u2019t have access to an oxygen mask in the event of an emergency. His words are echoed by Guido van Geenen, vice president of corporate communications for overhead bin supplier Diehl Aviation. Van Geenen tells CNN Travel that while the lockers are designed to accommodate \u201cquite a lot of weight\u201d that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re a safe place for passengers. \u201cClimbing in and out of an overhead bin may also be dangerous,\u201d adds van Geenen. In order to get into a locker, a person would have to clamber onto the back of the airplane seat, which could buckle under the weight. Van Geenen also makes the important point that \u201cbins do not have a way to open them from the inside\u201d \u2013 meaning if you\u2019re inside a locker and someone closes it from the outside \u201cyou have a problem.\u201d \u201cAll in all, we definitely do not recommend using the overhead bins for a nap,\u201d says van Geenen. \u201cThey are designed to safely hold the passengers\u2019 bags, but not made for a casual nap.\u201d Flight attendant\u2019s perspective Flight attendant Major\u2019s witnessed a lot in his 25 years of flying, but he\u2019s never actually seen a traveler inside the luggage bin. \u201cIf I saw a passenger trying to climb into an overhead locker, it would take me a few seconds to believe that was what was happening in front of me,\u201d he says. That said, Major admits he has \u201cseen photographs of crew in lockers\u201d and suggests it\u2019s the kind of thing that, while \u201cpretty frowned upon\u201d does happen from time to time when crew have the aircraft to themselves before boarding. While there\u2019s been a recent uptick in unruly passenger behavior on airplanes, Major says that if he encountered a passenger inside the locker, he wouldn\u2019t automatically assume they were being deliberately disruptive. His goal, first and foremost, would be to \u201cjust get them out\u201d and ensure they were safe. \u201cIt would depend on why they were up there as to my reaction,\u201d says Major. \u201cI would get them out, and then ascertain what was going on. I would assume that they were either under the influence of something, or mentally unwell.\u201d If a passenger spots another passenger inside an overhead locker, Major advises they notify a crew member, rather than intervene themselves \u2013 this same advice applies if passengers witness any untoward or unusual behavior on board. \u201cA passenger could inadvertently create a passenger disruption incident, because they could create conflict \u2013 whereas the crew are trained to de-escalate,\u201d Major says. Major also discourages passengers from filming and posting about an incident like this one. What might seem like a funny viral moment could have negative consequences, says Major, especially if the person in the video is already vulnerable. Future of overhead lockers While the airplane overhead locker is currently out of bounds for passengers, some as-yet-to-be-realized airplane cabin concepts reimagine this area as a space for travelers to stretch out and relax mid-flight. Take Toyota Boshoku\u2019s CLOUD CAPSULE concept, which envisages the area above the economy seat as an additional space for passengers to retreat to once the airplane reaches cruising altitude. In 2021, this design was nominated for a Crystal Cabin Award, a prestigious aviation design prize. While this concept might seem futuristic, the idea of passengers making use of the overhead locker space has some precedent. Way back in the 1950s, travelers who flew with Pan American Airways across the Atlantic on the Boeing 377 Stratocruiser were able to sleep in overhead compartments mid-flight. Major says flight attendants \u201calways look out for future developments,\u201d but he suggests crew are more focused on overhead lockers becoming bigger to accommodate more bags, rather than being adapted to accommodate passengers. \u201cHand luggage is one of the biggest issues facing flight attendants,\u201d says Major. \u201cIt causes problems if we can\u2019t get all those bags away or if we can\u2019t get passengers to put their bags away or if they\u2019re bringing too much on\u2026\u201d On most flights, overhead locker space is \u201cat a premium\u201d as Major puts it. Bins are so packed with travelers\u2019 bags and belongings that the idea of a person squeezing in there too is laughable. But Major is keen to stress that while the idea of someone climbing into the overhead locker might \u201cseem funny,\u201d it\u2019s important to remember an airplane cabin is a very specific environment and safety restrictions are there for a reason. \u201cYou\u2019re barrelling through the sky at 35,000 feet \u2013 500, 600 miles per hour,\u201d he says. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to create an issue on board the aircraft, it\u2019s not the place to do it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/airplane-spotted-passenger-overhead-bin/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "world"}}

A senior A-League player allegedly took instructions from the mastermind and arranged the infractions with teammates in designated games last year, according to New South Wales Police. Those arrested have not yet been named by police. Junior players would get 10,000 Australian dollars ($6,666) for getting yellow cards and conceding penalties in those games to influence results, assistant police commissioner Michael Fitzgerald said during a press conference on Friday. He said the alleged crimes happened in November and December last year, adding that \u201cthese players betrayed the trust of their supporters.\u201d Three players, age 27, 32, and 33, are set to appear in court later this month and next month, facing charges relating to \u201cconduct that corrupts a betting outcome of an event.\u201d Authorities are after a fourth player, who is currently out of state, for questioning, they added. Investigators have not disclosed the players\u2019 team, but said they are attached to a club in Sydney\u2019s south-west. Three out of 12 teams in the league are based in Sydney, but only Macarthur FC hails from south-western side of the city. Macarthur said in a statement: \u201cThe club is shocked and aware of the arrests of three A-League players by NSW Police as a result of international law enforcement coordination focused on betting corruption related to alleged yellow card manipulation in games.\u201d It added that it could not comment \u201cfor obvious reasons and given the ongoing police investigation,\u201d but will work closely with authorities on the matter. Detective Superintendent Peter Faux said police have found no indication that the senior player involved had been\u00a0threatened. Nor did they find evidence that players from other teams may have been complicit, he said. He said the bets were placed offshore, predominantly in South America, with no trace that betting has come from Australia. The league said in a statement that it was aware of the arrests. \u201cThe work to protect the integrity of our game must be unwavering and we are liaising closely with all relevant agencies on this matter,\u201d it said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/australia/australian-soccer-players-arrested-betting-plot-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_17_americas_gary-allen-srery-alberta-canada-deaths", "text": "After 48 years of investigation, Alberta Royal Canadian Mounted Police linked the deaths of four young women killed in the Calgary area in the 1970s to one man \u2013 a serial sexual offender who they believe may have committed more violent crimes until his death. Police say Gary Allen Srery killed\u00a0junior high school friends Eva Dvorak and Patricia McQueen, both 14 years old, in 1976, before killing Melissa Rehorek, 20, and Barbara MacLean, 19, in the span of a year. \u201cSrery\u2019s criminality spanned decades, over multiple jurisdictions, under numerous aliases, and the Alberta RCMP believe there may be more victims,\u201d Alberta RCMP said in a news release Friday. Crime scene DNA was seized during the initial homicide investigations, but due to a lack of DNA technology at the time, police failed to link a suspect to the killings. About 30 years later, in 2003, police were able to confirm the same suspect was linked to Rehorek and MacLean\u2019s deaths through DNA evidence. And in 2021, resubmitted crime scene evidence from the Dvorak and McQueen investigations unearthed a link with those of Rehorek and MacLean, according to RCMP. \u201cThe same unknown male DNA profile was identified on both victims that matched the unknown male DNA profile from the Rehorek and MacLean murders,\u201d police said in a news release. \u201cIn light of this new information, the RCMP believed that the same male offender was responsible for the deaths of all four victims.\u201d Advancements in forensic science technology and the use of forensic investigative genetic genealogy, which combines DNA analysis with traditional genealogy research, have allowed more breakthroughs with DNA evidence collection. Police used genetic genealogy to identify, Srery, an American who died of natural causes in an Idaho state prison in 2011 while serving a sentence for rape. \u201cWith assistance from Interpol and Idaho State Police Forensic Services, Srery\u2019s DNA was confirmed as a match to the unknown male DNA profile present on all four Calgary victims,\u201d police said. At the time of the killings, Srery was living illegally in Canada, having fled the US in 1974 after posting bail for a rape charge in California, according to RCMP. Before coming to Calgary, Srery had an extensive criminal record in the US for sexual offenses, including forcible rape, kidnapping, burglary and sexual perversion. Srery lived in Alberta and British Columbia from the mid 1970s until he was deported in 2003, police say. He used several aliases, including Willy Blackman and Rex Long. \u201cFor over forty years, investigators did not give up in their pursuit to identify those responsible for these murders,\u201d said David Hall of the Alberta RCMP. \u201cIdentifying the perpetrator does not bring Eva, Patsy, Melissa or Barbara back. It is our hope however, that the families are finally able to have some answers as to what happened to their loved ones all of those years ago,\u201d he said.

{"id": "2024_05_14_americas_venezuela-essequibo-guyana-csis-intl-latam", "text": "Venezuela continues to build up military infrastructure and hardware close to the border with Guyana as President Nicolas Maduro and his supporters scale up their threats to annex an\u00a0oil-rich piece of Guyanese land. In a report shared with CNN, the Washington-based think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) warns that while the Venezuelan government \u201chas little to gain and much to lose from a full-blown conflict\u201d it continues to play \u201ca dangerous game\u201d over its claim over the densely forested Essequibo region. \u201cThe constant drumbeat asserting \u2018the Essequibo is ours,\u2019 alongside the creation of new military commands and legal structures to oversee the defense of the region, is helping to institutionalize a sense of perpetual prewar footing,\u201d it wrote. Tension over the region, which amounts to about two-thirds of Guyanese national territory, mounted last year after a Venezuelan referendum in which voters assented to creating\u00a0a Venezuelan state within the disputed region. Guyana had called the move a step towards annexation and an \u201cexistential\u201d threat as the specter of armed conflict loomed over the region. CNN previously reported in February about an expansion of operations at Venezuela\u2019s Anacoco Island military base despite both countries agreeing in December to pursue a diplomatic avenue to resolve the conflict. Using satellite imagery and social media, CSIS found that the expansion of Anacoco Island\u2019s military base has continued. A bridge is seen being built across the Cuyuni River to connect the Venezuelan riverbank to the island, which has been a point of contention between the countries after it was awarded to Guyana in an 1899 ruling by an international tribunal. Venezuela annexed it in the 1960s. The island\u2019s airfield has expanded and now includes a small control tower, CSIS writes. Satellite imagery from March showed an area next to the airfield with more than 75 field tents, \u201cenough for a battalion-sized unit of several hundred personnel.\u201d The field tents have since been relocated to the southern side of the airfield \u201cdemonstrating the base\u2019s continued ability to provide logistics and resupply for a sizeable military force continuously for over a month,\u201d it wrote. Meanwhile, by the coast, at least two Iranian-built\u00a0Peykaap III (Zolfaghar) fast missile boats are seen at Venezuela\u2019s small coast guard station at Punta Barima, \u201cplacing Venezuelan missiles and naval forces within arm\u2019s reach of the Guyana-administered Essequibo\u201d as it just 40 miles (64 kilometers) from the Guyanese border. Maduro could \u2018fall victim to own rhetoric\u2019 The threats to Guyana have concerned its partners. Last week, two US Navy F/A-18 fighter jets flew over the capital Georgetown, demonstrating \u201cour routine security cooperation and expanding bilateral defense partnership with Guyana,\u201d the US Embassy in Guyana wrote. While smaller than Idaho, Guyana is home to vast oil reserves and is on track to become the world\u2019s highest per capita oil producer. It, however, has an army estimated to be less than 5,000 soldiers, and lacks the hardware or manpower to face possible Venezuelan aggression. All things considered, \u201cif you\u2019re if you\u2019re Guyana, and your army is 5,000 people, it doesn\u2019t seem like the Venezuelans are taking their foot off the gas,\u201d Ryan Berg, director of the Americas Program\u00a0at CSIS and lead author of the report, told CNN. There has been speculation that the upcoming Venezuelan elections at the end of July have given Maduro the motivation to escalate against Guyana, using it as a way to distract from his record: Millions of people have fled the country due to poor economic conditions, food shortages and limited access to health care. CSIS argues that instead of tamping down the aggression after the vote, \u201cMaduro may be tempted to ramp up both rhetoric and action related to the Essequibo in a true gambit to manufacture a regional crisis in the aftermath of a stolen election.\u201d It may not be in Maduro\u2019s interest to \u201cinitiate a full-blown conflict with neighbor Guyana, but his escalatory rhetoric tethers his political reputation and legitimacy to his willingness to back his words with force\u201d especially with his key internal ally, the armed forces, CSIS writes. \u201cThus, one of the most concerning possibilities is that Maduro will fall victim to his own rhetoric. He has whipped up nationalist passions without providing an escape valve.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/americas/venezuela-essequibo-guyana-csis-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_02_style_aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl", "text": "Miami has a new addition to its skyline \u2013 a 66-story residential tower built by Aston Martin, marking the British luxury sports carmaker\u2019s first foray into the residential real estate market. Comprising of 391 units, Aston Martin Residences Miami sits at the mouth of the Miami River on Biscayne Bay, the firm said in a statement Tuesday. Designed in partnership with architect Rodolfo Miani of Bodas Mian Anger and built by G&G Business Developments, the 249-meter- (818-foot-) tall building houses seven penthouses, each with private pools and terraces, as well as apartments ranging in size from one to five bedrooms. The largest unit is the \u201cUnique Triplex Penthouse,\u201d arranged over three floors at the top of the building, which remains on the market for $59 million. The property was officially opened on Tuesday. Timed to coincide with the Formula One Miami Grand Prix, the company said in a statement that it marks \u201cthe latest distinct expression of Aston Martin\u2019s ultra-luxury high performance brand.\u201d Featuring an infinity pool with a pool deck, jacuzzis and cabanas on the 55th floor, the sail-shaped complex has a two-floor fitness center, two movie theaters and a virtual golf simulator. The building has a sky bar and lounge, chef\u2019s kitchen, ballroom and private dining areas, as well as a spa, beauty salon and barber shop. Direct access to the sea via a superyacht marina is also available, plus a private butler service. Germ\u00e1n Coto, chief executive officer of G&G Business Developments, told CNN Tuesday that the firm wanted to work on a project in the \u201ccosmopolitan city\u201d of Miami, and that this piece of land was the perfect choice. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing plot with an excellent view of the river,\u201d said Coto. The structure\u2019s aerodynamic shape helps the building deal with the technical challenges presented by high winds in the area, as well as evoking the sleek shape of an Aston Martin, according to Marek Reichman, executive vice president and chief creative officer of Aston Martin. It also becomes wider from the base to the mid-section before tightening once more towards the top, making it appear to bow out over people on street level, Reichman told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the drama,\u201d he added. Challenges However, the process wasn\u2019t all plain sailing. \u201cIt was difficult to achieve what we wanted because the space and the plot is kind of small,\u201d said Coto, with the building fitting into a 1.25-acre plot of land. Meanwhile, local building regulations imposed strict standards, explained Reichman, taking into account the low-lying land and propensity for flooding. \u201cThey were some of the most amazing challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to withstand the flooding with the windows that are on street level.\u201d There were further obstacles due to the curved shape of the building, which means that units on the east side have an individual architectural structural component. Aston Martin touches Homeowners are able to customize their interior space with the help of the Aston Martin design team, with three style packages \u2013 Timeless, Covert and Indulgent \u2013 drawing on the company\u2019s British heritage, as well as the building\u2019s context. \u201cIt needs to have part of the DNA of an Aston Martin,\u201d Reichman said. \u201cBut we are in Miami, you don\u2019t have a cold November evening where you need to put the log fire on, so you\u2019ve got to be considerate of the environment that you\u2019re in.\u201d Design elements running through the building include doors with bespoke Aston Martin handles, number plinths and kestrel tan leather door tabs. Aston Martin said that 99% of the properties sold before the building was completed. Residences were sold for $1.5 million to $8.5 million, while penthouses ranged from $16 million to $59 million. The Unique Triplex Penthouse, on the market for $59 million, comes with the last remaining Aston Martin Vulcan, an 820 brake horsepower all-carbon fiber supercar, of which only 24 exist, a spokesman for the company said. Meanwhile, buyers of the 47 Signature and Penthouse units were also able to choose between an Aston Martin DBX sports SUV or the company\u2019s DB11 sportscar. Aston Martin isn\u2019t the first luxury carmaker to enter the residential property market. A 63-story building from Bentley will open in 2026 along the coastline of Sunny Isles Beach, Florida.

{"id": "2024_05_17_europe_vatican-guidance-supernatural-phenomena-scli-intl", "text": "The Vatican has tightened up its guidance on recognizing supernatural phenomena such as apparitions of the Virgin Mary and seemingly blood-soaked crucifixes. The new guidelines replace rules drawn up in 1978 and say that bishops should no longer act independently over such sightings but instead consult the Vatican. The changes made by the Vatican\u2019s doctrinal office (DDF) aim to to bring the church up to date in responding to the swift spread of claims of apparitions online. According to the document released by the Vatican Friday, the new procedure will allow for \u201cfaster decisions while respecting popular devotion\u201d when it comes to assessing claims of supernatural phenomena, which could include the appearance of stigmata and other purported miracles. Under the previous guidelines, a local bishop could rapidly declare a phenomenon\u2019s supernatural nature, the Vatican said, \u201conly for the Holy Office to express a different decision later.\u201d In other instances a bishop might decide whether or not an occurrence was supernatural only for his successor to conclude the opposite, the statement continued. The new Vatican guidelines say \u201cas a rule\u201d bishops and church officials will not declare whether alleged phenomena are supernatural or not, leaving this decision to the Pope. The head of the DDF, Cardinal Victor Manuel Fernandez, told reporters that often these events \u201chave led to a great richness of spiritual fruits, growth in faith, devotion, fraternity, and service. In some cases, they have given rise to shrines throughout the world that are at the heart of many people\u2019s popular piety today.\u201d Speaking at a Vatican press conference, the cardinal cited Lourdes, the Marian shrine in the southwest of France visited by those with physical and spiritual ailments, as a positive example. However, he went on to add that some alleged events which derive from the pursuit of \u201cprofit, power, fame, social recognition, or other personal interest\u201d may harm the faithful, potentially even to the extent of \u201cexerting control over people or carrying out abuses.\u201d Bishops will now generally be expected to issue a \u201cnihil obstat\u201d which will allow for worship but will leave open the issue of formal recognition of \u201csupernatural\u201d activity to the Vatican. However, Fernandez said that this recognition would be \u201cvery exceptional\u201d. Other options available to the bishops include the option to formally reject an experience as supernatural, as well as steps to ban or limit worship of phenomena regarded with suspicion. The guidelines state that those spreading false claims can face sanctions, including formal church penalties. Positive criteria that will be considered by the Church when making a conclusion include the credibility and reputation of those reporting the occurrence, while negative criteria include possible errors, overt pursuit of personal interest, and \u201cany psychosis (or) collective hysteria.\u201d One site of alleged Marian apparitions still under review by the Vatican is Medjugorje, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, with Cardinal Fernandez telling reporters the claims would be studied according to the new norms.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/europe/vatican-guidance-supernatural-phenomena-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_04_17_style_copenhagen-stock-exchange-fire-police-investigation-intl", "text": "Police launched an investigation Wednesday into the fire that tore through Copenhagen\u2019s famous stock exchange building, causing the collapse of its spire and damaging centuries-old artwork and architecture. The blaze was still burning on Wednesday afternoon, more than 24 hours after it began, and authorities and citizens in the Danish capital have started reckoning with the loss of one of the city\u2019s most recognizable landmarks. Local firefighters continued to try to put out the fire, which ripped through\u00a0the building \u2013 known locally as B\u00f8rsen \u2013\u00a0from early Tuesday, reaching all its floors and causing the collapse of a dragon-tail spire that had long been a symbol of the city. The walls of the building are still standing, but the interior has been significantly damaged and the roof is partially collapsed. Firefighters used cranes to hose water down into the building. Copenhagen\u00a0police meanwhile launched an investigation on Wednesday, which they said will be a \u201ccomplicated process.\u201d Police officer Brian Belling said authorities have already \u201cconducted interviews, secured surveillance and carried out a large number of investigative steps.\u201d \u201cBut of course, there is still a lot to do, especially as we have not yet had the opportunity to examine\u00a0B\u00f8rsen itself,\u201d Belling added. The 17th century building exemplified the style of the Dutch Renaissance, and housed a number of artworks, some of which were saved on Tuesday. Residents were stunned by the outbreak, which brought back memories of the fire that tore through the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris exactly five years and a day earlier. \u201cMy first thought was (that) I hope that they rebuild it \u2013 it\u2019s never going to be the same but it\u2019s iconic to\u00a0Copenhagen\u00a0and Denmark,\u201d teacher Eva Simoni Lomholdt, 58, told Reuters. Brian Mikkelsen, the CEO of the Danish Chamber of Commerce which owns the building, told the news agency that a firefighter gave him the top of the spire on Wednesday morning after it was recovered following its fall. \u201cIt gives me hope because we have decided to rebuild the stock exchange because it\u2019s part of European history as a trading continent,\u201d he said. The old stock exchange \u2013 located only a few minutes walk from Christiansborg\u00a0Palace \u2013 dates back to 1625. It was built in the Dutch Renaissance style at the request of King Christian IV and had recently been undergoing renovations with its facade covered in scaffolding and protective coverings. It has been at the heart of Danish business since then; while it no longer houses the Danish stock exchange, it serves as the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce. Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said Tuesday a \u201cpiece of Danish history\u201d was on fire, calling the building \u201cirreplaceable.\u201d Denmark\u2019s culture minister Jakob Engel-Schmidt added that 400 years of cultural heritage had been damaged. \u201cHow touching it is to see how the employees at B\u00f8rsen, good people from the emergency services and passers-by work together to rescue art treasures and iconic images from the burning building,\u201d he said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/17/style/copenhagen-stock-exchange-fire-police-investigation-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_weather_south-flooding-texas-louisiana-climate", "text": "At least four people are dead in Houston after hurricane-force winds and torrential rains tore a damaging path through the city Thursday \u2013 part of a lashing storm system that is bringing life-threatening flooding and power outages to parts of the South. Severe storms carved through parts of Texas Thursday before pushing into western Louisiana through Friday\u2019s early hours, prompting an overnight flash flood warning for New Orleans. As the sun rises Friday, several cities in the storm\u2019s path will begin to take stock of damage left in the storms\u2019 wake. One person was killed in Houston when a crane was toppled by strong winds and two other deaths were caused by fallen trees, according to Houston Fire Chief Samuel Pe\u00f1a, citing preliminary information. Violent storms in Houston blew out skyscraper windows, partially collapsed a nightclub and ripped a strip of roofing off the downtown Hyatt Regency, showering the hotel lobby with rain and debris, according to witness video. All non-essential workers are urged to stay home tomorrow and city schools are closed as widespread power outages have darkened the city and disabled traffic lights, Mayor John Whitmire said. Streets are littered with debris, downed trees and power lines, and the downtown area is dusted with glass from broken windows, he added. Major flooding has prompted water rescues in at least one Texas city. As many as 20 drivers had to be helped from rising water in Bryan, about 100 miles northwest of Houston, police said. Power outages left more than 900,000 homes and businesses in the dark across Texas as of Thursday night. More than 200,000 are also without power in Louisiana as storms batter the state. Possible tornadoes posed a risk in Texas and Louisiana, and carried the threat of destructive winds and golf ball-sized hail. A reported tornado in Convent, Louisiana, downed trees and power poles late Thursday, the Storm Prediction Center said. Parts of Texas and western Louisiana are under a rare Level 4 of 4 high risk of excessive rainfall Thursday, the Weather Prediction Center said. More than 600,\ufeff000 people live in the high-risk zone. High risk days like this only happen on 4% of days each year, but account for more than 80% of all flood damage and more than a third of all flood deaths in the United States, according to the WPC. Just three other days have reached this concerning mark this year, including the most recent one nearly three weeks ago. It\u2019s a sign the atmosphere is primed to unload extreme amounts of rain, a phenomenon that is becoming more frequent in a warming world driven by human-caused climate change. Widespread rainfall totals of 2 to 6 inches are expected from Texas to Georgia through Saturday morning. A few spots caught under multiple torrential storms may pick up 8 inches or more of rain. It\u2019s not out of the question that one or two spots could record close to a foot of rain in about 48 hours. Texas and Louisiana have been in the bull\u2019s-eye of seemingly unrelenting rounds of torrential, flooding downpours since the start of April. Rainfall in the waterlogged area over the last two weeks is over 600% of what\u2019s typical, according to the WPC. Double-digit rainfall totals between 20 and 30 inches over the region in recent weeks have soaked the ground and left rivers swollen, priming the flood threat to extreme levels. Drenched soils are not expected to soak up any of Thursday\u2019s rainfall, the WPC warned Thursday morning. Widespread flash flooding could begin minutes after heavy rain starts to fall. Flooding ramps up Thursday and threat persists Friday Storms, some severe, rumbled to life Thursday afternoon in parts of Texas and prompted flash flood warnings for multiple cities, including Waco. Powerful, heavy storms will push south and east and reach Louisiana and Mississippi late in the day. More than 800,000 outages have been reported in Harris County, where Houston is located, according to PowerOutage.us. Harris County is the third-most populous in the United States. A tornado warning had been issued earlier Thursday evening in Harris County, including downtown Houston, according to the National Weather Service. The weather service also issued a severe thunderstorm warning for Houston with the highest-level \u201cdestructive\u201d tag. At around 6:30 p.m., the weather service in Houston noted a \u201cdestructive storm\u201d with wind gusts of up to 80 mph was over the metro area, and urged residents to take cover immediately in a post on X. Winds in the city were reported as high as 71 mph, according to the weather service.\u00a0On the east side of the city, there were reports of winds up to 78 mph \u2013 equivalent to the strength of a Category 1 hurricane. Multiple steel power transmission towers in Houston have been mangled by the storms, CNN affiliate KPRC reported. Along part of US Route 290, traffic was stopped as firefighters cleared downed lines draped over the roadway. Houston Mayor John Whitmire advised residents to stay off the roads. \u201cThe mayor and first responders are asking Houstonians to stay off the roads and avoid all unnecessary travel. Many roads are impassible due to downed power lines, debris, and fallen trees,\u201d the mayor\u2019s office said in a statement Thursday evening. \u201cThere are significant power outages and reports of damage across the city. We are working with Centerpoint, METRO and other regional partners to keep everyone safe.\u201d Rainfall rates up to 3 inches per hour are possible in the heaviest storms, which could lead to life-threatening flash flooding, according to the WPC. Damaging winds, hail and a couple of tornadoes are also possible. The greatest flooding danger will come as storms train later Thursday. Training storms track through and deluge the same areas over and over, like a train pulling its cars over the same stretch of track. Serious flash flooding is likely in any areas caught under multiple storms unloading 2 to 3 inches of rain per hour. Roadways may quickly become rivers and small streams could easily overflow their banks. More than 35 million people in the South are under a Level 2 of 4 or Level 3 of 4 risk of excessive rainfall Thursday. Many areas may only endure one torrential storm, but even brief downpours will be enough to cause flooding problems given how wet the South has been recently. Drenching storms from Thursday night will last into Friday for parts of the Gulf Coast. An initial round of flash flooding is likely in the first half of Friday before rain starts to taper off in the afternoon. Another bout of heavy rain will develop Friday night and continue into the earliest hours of Saturday morning, working over the same areas hit earlier in the day. These storms could produce rainfall rates of 2 to 3 inches per hour, and quickly restart or worsen any ongoing flooding. Extremely wet start to the year The rain will only add to already extreme rainfall totals in what\u2019s been one of the wettest years to date on record across the Gulf Coast. Some Southeast cities have recorded more than half a foot of rain above what\u2019s typical for the first several months of the year. Several dozen cities from Texas to western Georgia are pacing at a top 5 wettest year to date and at least two cities in eastern Texas are experiencing their wettest year, according to the\u00a0Southeast Regional Climate Center. Dallas is experiencing its third-wettest year to date while Shreveport, Louisiana, is amid its second wettest. Excessive rainfall has largely eliminated dryness and drought conditions along the Gulf Coast, but it hasn\u2019t come without a cost. Earlier this month, nearly 2 feet of rain fell in just five days and sent parts of eastern Texas underwater. Hundreds of people and animals were rescued from flooding as some area\u00a0rivers rose to levels\u00a0not reached since Hurricane Harvey in 2017.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/weather/south-flooding-texas-louisiana-climate/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_17_world_ancient-arachnid-spiny-legs-intl-scli-scn", "text": "The idea of coming face to face with a spider-like creature unexpectedly is enough to fill any arachnophobe with horror, let alone encountering one with large, spiky legs. But that is exactly what roamed around what\u2019s currently northeast Illinois in the late Carboniferous Period about 300 million to 320 million years ago, according to a study published Friday in the Journal of Paleontology. The newly discovered long-extinct species is described as a \u201clarge spider-like arachnid\u201d with \u201cdistinctive large spines on the legs\u201d by the study\u2019s authors. They were unable to place the creature within any known arachnid order due to the specimen\u2019s lack of mouthparts, which scientists use to classify them.  \u201cYou see sort of spiny legs in some arachnids, but we\u2019ve never seen one that really has these big spines all the way along, at least the first parts of the legs. It\u2019s very, very striking,\u201d Dr. Jason Dunlop, a curator of arachnids and myriapods at Berlin\u2019s Museum f\u00fcr Naturkunde and the study\u2019s coauthor, told CNN on Friday. \u201cWe looked at it twice and said, \u2018What are we looking at here?\u2019\u201d Expert fossil preparator Bob Masek first discovered the specimen in the 1980s in the fossil deposits preserved at Illinois\u2019 Mazon Creek Lagerst\u00e4tte. (The German word is a term paleontologists use to describe an exceptional site with many perfectly preserved fossils.) \ufeffHowever, it wasn\u2019t until 2023 that it became apparent the specimen was a newfound species and fossil collector David Douglass, who had acquired it from Masek, donated it for research. Researchers then examined and photographed the fossil using a camera attached to a microscope. They found that the creature was \u201cevidently something very different from any previously described arachnid,\u201d with spiny legs that resemble some modern harvestmen arachnids but with a different type of body. The creature likely used its spines for defensive purposes rather than to attack other animals, similar to a hedgehog\u2019s spines today, Dunlop said. \u201cIt means if something tries to bite it, it catches the spines in its mouth. \u2026 We talk about handling time, which means if you want to eat something spiny, it takes longer because you\u2019ve got to break the spines off or bite the bits that haven\u2019t got spines on it,\u201d he added. \u201cWe can guess there were scorpions and other spiders around,\u201d Dunlop said, as well as primitive lizardlike animals or large amphibians that would have hunted these arachnids, but it isn\u2019t possible to know for certain. Without the mouthparts, researchers cannot pinpoint its closest relative, but they hypothesize it could belong to a wider group including spiders, whip spiders and whip scorpions. Paleontologists have only found this particular species in North America so far, but it could \u201cturn up somewhere else\u201d in Northern Europe too, Dunlop said. \u201cA huge area across a lot of what\u2019s now Europe and North America was probably a kind of giant tropical rainforest and wherever coal is found today, you\u2019ve got a reasonable chance of finding these fossils (of arachnids, plants and insects),\u201d he added. Ultimately, researchers named the species Douglassarachne acanthopoda. The genus name honors the Douglass family, who donated the specimen to Chicago\u2019s Field Museum of Natural History, and the species name references the spines that make this arachnid so distinctive.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/world/ancient-arachnid-spiny-legs-intl-scli-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "travel_mallory-disappeared-everest-summit-mystery", "text": "It\u2019s one of climbing\u2019s greatest mysteries: was Everest really conquered for the first time in 1953, or did two mountaineers make it to the summit in 1924, before dying in mysterious circumstances? British climbers George Mallory and Andrew \u201cSandy\u201d Irvine were last seen on June 8, 1924, 800 feet below the peak, before disappearing into clouds. They never reemerged. When Mallory\u2019s body was found in 1999, hopes were high that it might give a clue as to whether the pair reached the summit. But, tantalizingly, the camera he had been carrying \u2013 with which he would have documented the highest point they had reached \u2013 was not on the body. Irvine\u2019s body has never been found. But now, as the 100th anniversary of the mens\u2019 disappearance approaches, one researcher believes that he has solved mountaineering\u2019s greatest mystery. By studying the expedition weather reports, author Graham Hoyland believes that he has worked out what happened to the pair \u2013 and whether they made it to the summit before they died. Hoyland \u2013 a distant relative of another member of the expedition group, who has visited on Everest nine times searching for the remains \u2013 believes that the key to the mystery is air pressure. His relative several times removed, Howard Somervell \u2013 another mountaineer, who had got within 1,000 feet of the summit on the same expedition before a lack of oxygen meant he had to retreat \u2013 was responsible for tracking the weather during the expedition. The smoking gun? His records \u2013 which he submitted after the official report on the 1924 expedition was made, having returned to his job as a surgeon in India \u2013 show that the barometric pressure dropped between the morning of June 8 and June 9 at base camp, where Somervell was taking the readings. Somervell recorded the pressure in inches of mercury, dropping from 16.25 to 15.98. Hoyland believes that these figures equate to a 10 millibar drop in pressure. Weather-related deaths on Everest are generally associated with a drop in barometric pressure at the summit. A decrease of just 4 millibars can trigger hypoxia; a 6 millibar drop was enough to cause the incident in 1996 in which 20 people were trapped on the mountain, eight of whom died. That story is recounted in writer Jon Krakauer\u2019s book \u201cInto Thin Air.\u201d The bad weather angle was also explored in a 2010 paper by experts from the University of Toronto, led by G.W. Kent Moore. \u201cThey were climbing into an absolute s***storm \u2013 not only a blizzard but a sort of snow bomb,\u201d Hoyland told CNN. Hoyland has experienced \u201csnow bombs\u201d himself on Everest. \u201cIt\u2019s terrifying \u2013 the temperature drops hugely, you\u2019re gasping for breath. There are winds of 1,000 knots. One guy I know was blown off the mountain, and ended up further up the mountain,\u201d he said. Effectively, the drop in air pressure meant that the mountain suddenly became higher \u2013 around 650 feet higher, to be precise. Hoyland calls it \u201can invisible death trap.\u201d The pair \u2013 who were ascending along the northwest ridge \u2013 were already climbing against the odds. Mallory wrote in a letter to his wife that he put his chances of making the summit at 50 to one. Hoyland thinks it was more like 20 to one. But, he thinks, they would have had no idea what was about to hit them. \u201cMallory had seen Norton and Somervell get to to within 1000 feet of the top on 4 June using no oxygen equipment; it would have seemed reasonable to assume that it was possible to reach the summit with the apparatus,\u201d he writes in a forthcoming book. \u201cWhat he didn\u2019t know was that the rapidly falling air pressure was effectively making the mountain even higher. What\u2019s more, the storm and blizzard wouldn\u2019t just have made a drop in air pressure. The pair were wearing layers of silk, cotton and wool. Hoyland \u2013 who had a similar made-to-measure outfit on an Everest trip \u2013 says that the clothes are exceptionally comfortable but wouldn\u2019t have provided the warmth to survive a blizzard or an overnight. Previously, it has been speculated that the pair had reached the summit before dying on the way down, something that Hoyland calls \u201cwishful thinking.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d been trying to prove that Mallory had climbed Everest for years and years \u2013 I wanted to prove that I was the 16th Briton to climb it, not the 15th. But unfortunately when you read facts and they\u2019re different, you have to change your mind. You can\u2019t carry on being a wishful thinker,\u201d he says. Until Hoyland, nobody had closely studied at the weather reports, which were held at the Royal Geographical Society in London. The summit was eventually reached by Edmund Hillary, a New Zealand mountaineer, in 1953 \u2013 the first documented ascent of the peak. A century of speculation The mystery of Mallory and Irvine has intrigued adventurers for decades. In 1933, another mountaineer, Percy Wyn-Harris found an ax near the summit. It was assumed to have belonged to Irvine. In 1936, another mountaineer, Frank Smythe, believed he had seen two bodies in the distance. Using a telescope, he saw them at around 8,100 meters, or 26,575 feet. And Chinese mountaineer Wang Hongbao believed he saw a body during his 1975 ascent. Finally, an expedition in 1999, instigated by Hoyland, found Mallory\u2019s body at 26,700 feet \u20132,335 below the summit. Hoyland believes that the pair, tethered to each other, slipped while aborting the climb and returning to base camp. He thinks Mallory survived the initial fall, but took another, fatal plunge while staggering back to base camp. Irvine\u2019s body has never been found. Everest \u2018makes people mad\u2019 While some of Mallory\u2019s possessions were still to be found on his body, including a pair of goggles in his pocket \u2013 which suggests he was either in darkness or poor visibility \u2013 there was no sign of the photo of his wife which he had brought, planning to leave it on the summit. For decades, researchers have posited that, in lieu of more precise evidence, the lack of photo suggests the pair might have reached the summit and fallen while returning. However, having reviewed the new evidence, Hoyland believes this is not the case. Expedition reports noted a blizzard hitting the mountain at 2 p.m., he says \u2013 long before they could have reached the summit. The lack of photo, he thinks, means nothing. Mallory often forgot stuff, he notes. In his last letter to his wife \u2013 digitized to mark the centenary of his ascent \u2013 on May 27, Mallory wrote of \u201clooking out of a tent door onto a world of snow and vanishing hopes: and described it as \u201ca bad time altogether.\u201d Both he and Irvine were unwell, and he wrote that \u201cI\u2019m quite doubtful if I shall be fit enough.\u201d For Hoyland, who is taking part in an event at the Royal Geographical Society about the centenary, \u201cEverest makes people mad.\u201d \u201cMallory became obsessed with the desire to conquer Everest \u2013 it would have made him somebody,\u201d he said. Mallory was a teacher, but moved on the fringes of the Bloomsbury set, a group of British intellectuals, artists and thinkers centered on London in the early 20th century. \u201cEveryone he knew was a famous novelist or a Nobel prizewinner, and he got captivated by it [the idea of Everest],\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a dangerous thing called \u2018summit fever\u2019 \u2013 you see the summit, and you think, \u2018Right, it\u2019s death or glory.\u2019 You don\u2019t care if you die. \u201cI know that feeling. You get completely possessed by this mountain. Mallory was possessed by Everest and it killed him.\u201d Hoyland, who has since swapped mountaineering for extreme sailing, says that Everest has become \u201ca non-mountaineer\u2019s mountain.\u201d \u201cThere are rich men climbing it as a trophy. I wish it wasn\u2019t the highest,\u201d he said. \u201cQuite honestly I think the best thing to happen would be if the top 800 feet fell off.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/mallory-disappeared-everest-summit-mystery/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_europe_slovakia-prime-minister-fico-out-of-danger-intl-hnk", "text": "Slovakian police have charged a man, described as a politically motivated \u201clone wolf,\u201d\u00a0with the attempted murder\u00a0of Prime Minister Robert Fico, who is seriously ill in hospital after\u00a0an assassination attempt that shocked the eastern European nation. Fico was conscious and able to speak on Thursday afternoon, according to his long-time ally and the Slovakian President-elect Peter Pellegrini who visited him in the hospital. He said the prime minister was still in serious condition after being\u00a0shot five times from a close range and undergoing surgery. The assassination attempt rocked the central\u00a0European country and sparked global condemnation. Slovakia\u2019s Interior Minister Mat\u00fa\u0161 \u0160utaj E\u0161tok said the suspect told law enforcement officers that his action was motivated by his disagreement with the government and its reforms. The 59-year-old populist leader, who returned to power last year and whose controversial policy changes have sparked protests in recent weeks, was attacked on Wednesday after an off-site government meeting in the town of Handlova. \u0160utaj E\u0161tok said the police was pursuing only one investigative theory \u2013 that the attack was politically motivated. He said that the suspect told law enforcement officers that he disagreed with Fico\u2019s policies and that he decided to act after the recent presidential election, which saw a Fico ally \u2013 Pellegrini \u2013 emerge as the winner. \u201cThe reasons (the suspect gave) were the decision to abolish the special prosecutor\u2019s office, the decision to stop supplying military assistance to Ukraine, the reform of public service broadcaster and the dismissal of the judicial council head,\u201d \u0160utaj E\u0161tok said. He said the suspect is not a member of any extremist group, calling him \u201ca lone wolf\u201d who had in the past attended anti-government protests. The alleged shooter has been identified by multiple local media outlets. Asked whether the 71-year-old described in some media as Juraj C. from Levice, a town in southwest Slovakia, is the suspect, the spokesperson for the prosecutor\u2019s office, Zuzana Drobov\u00e1, told CNN on Thursday: \u201cI can confirm this is the person who has been charged.\u201d Slovakian media reported the shooter was a writer and a poet. The Slovak Writers\u2019 Association said Wednesday that the name identified in the local media was a member of the group. The prime minister had approached a small crowd of people waiting to meet him, when the suspected gunman in the crowd lunged forward and shot him five times from across a security barrier. Footage from the scene showed the injured prime minister being bundled into a vehicle by his staff, before it speeds away with him inside. Nobody else was injured in the attack. The alleged shooter has been identified by multiple local media outlets as a 71-year-old man from southern Slovakia. There has been no official confirmation of the identity of the shooter, but his face was clearly visible in some of the video footage of the attack and his subsequent arrest. Slovakian media reported the shooter was a writer and a poet. The Slovak Writers\u2019 Association said Wednesday that the name identified in the local media was a member of the group. Dramatic footage from the scene of the attack shows the gunman approaching Fico and firing at him from close range across a security barrier. The injured prime minister is then seen being bundled into a vehicle by his staff, before it speeds away with him inside. Fico was first rushed into a local hospital and then airlifted to a major trauma center in the nearby city of Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica, where he spent more than five hours in surgery, according to hospital officials. Officials said he was shot, among other places, in his stomach. Hospital director Miriam Lapun\u00edkov\u00e1 is said Thursday Fico was \u201cstabilized but in a very serious condition\u201d and that he would remain in the hospital\u2019s intensive care unit. She added that the hospital had two surgical teams operating on the prime minister. On Thursday morning, the country\u2019s Defense Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Robert Kali\u0148\u00e1k said Fico\u2019s condition \u201chas been stabilized overnight, more steps are being taken to better his health. The situation is really serious.\u201d The assassination attempt sent shockwaves across the country. Kali\u0148\u00e1k and \u0160utaj E\u0161tok delivered an emotional news conference outside the hospital on Wednesday night, saying the leader was \u201cfighting for his life.\u201d Visibly shaken and sometimes struggling for words, the two ministers appeared in deep shock over the attack. Later in the news conference, both men struck a more combative tone, blaming the attack on the \u201chatred\u201d being spread by \u201csome people\u201d and the media. Divisive figure in divided country Fico is the most powerful lawmaker in Slovakia. Unlike the president, whose role is more ceremonial and has limited scope, the prime minister holds rank as the decision-making head of government. Slovaks have been deeply divided over the country\u2019s direction and position in the world since Fico\u2019s return to power last year. Supporters see Fico as a caring leader who has their interests at heart; critics say he is a populist whose pro-Russian leanings pose major risks for the country. Slovakia\u2019s defense and interior ministers blamed rising hate speech and division for the political atmosphere in the country, which they said led to the assassination attempt. As prime minister,\u00a0Fico made a major U-turn in Slovakia\u2019s foreign policy and its previously staunch support for Ukraine, pledging to end the country\u2019s military support for Kyiv and promising to block Ukraine\u2019s NATO ambitions. The government is also trying to shut down the public service broadcaster and replace it with a new national broadcaster that would be under tighter state control.

{"id": "2024_05_17_tech_ai-high-school", "text": "At Princeton High School, students are trying to combat the rapid decline of indigenous languages with some unlikely help: a furry, wide-eyed stuffed animal named Che\u2019w. But Che\u2019w isn\u2019t a standard plush toy. He\u2019s a wildly intelligent generative AI robot that speaks Mam, a Mayan language spoken in the western highlands of Guatemala and Mexico and by a small population of the school\u2019s students.\u00a0The language is currently at risk of extinction, according to UNESCO; the students hope Che\u2019w can help change that. At a time when some high schools are restricting the use of AI in the classroom, others, like Princeton High School, are leaning into it. In the short 18 months since the launch of viral chatbot ChatGPT, generative AI has emerged as a revolutionary technology in the field of artificial intelligence. Its capabilities have impressed both users and experts with its ability to perform a range of tasks, from generating creative content, essays and games to conducting mathematical equations, summarizing complicated concepts and more. All that is already reshaping various parts of our lives, including education. But the technology has leaped ahead far faster, in many cases, than schools\u2019 understanding of how to use it. And with new products out this week from Google\u2019s XYZ initiative and OpenAI\u2019s new GPT-4o, many teachers and districts realize they cannot avoid the subject. Dr. Joy Barnes-Johnson, the science administrator for PHS, said the school is \u201ctrying to embrace AI\u201d as much as possible. \u201cIt\u2019s a tool, just like a pencil is technology that helps communication.\u201d She said the school will host an AI summit this summer with its teachers and administrators to have a conversation about how generative AI should or shouldn\u2019t be used in the classroom. \u201cIn the beginning of the school year, we talked about how AI is the world we\u2019re in now and we have a responsibility to prepare kids for the world they will inherit,\u201d she said. \u201cThe idea is that it will help people connect and learn, so we [as teachers] have to not be afraid of it.\u201d Proceeding with caution When ChatGPT launched in November 2022, teachers worried that the tool, which can generate convincing responses and essays in response to user prompts, could make it easier for students to cheat on assignments. Some also worried ChatGPT and similar tools could be used to spread inaccurate information. Not long after its launch, New York City public schools became one of the first school districts to ban students and teachers from using ChatGPT on the district\u2019s networks and devices. Other schools reacted similarly in the weeks and months that followed, including the Los Angeles Unified School District and Seattle Public Schools, which blocked access to ChatGPT on their networks. Some of these districts have evolved their policies over time. The LAUSD, for example, has since launched a chatbot named \u201cEd\u201d to act as a student advisor, with the ability to inform parents about information ranging from children\u2019s test results to their school attendance. Many schools also continue to grapple with how to best approach the technology inside the classroom. \u201cThere is acceptance by educators, but we\u2019re still seeing a lot of caution,\u201d said Noel Candelaria, the secretary-treasurer of the National Education Association who is leading the charge around the union\u2019s AI policy. \u201cThe challenge is there isn\u2019t a lot of guidance on the district level, so the concern educators have is that it\u2019s being something done to them, instead of with them.\u201d He added: \u201cThere are also major concerns around data confidentiality and where data is being pulled from.\u201d Candelaria told CNN that educators feel strongly that they want their voice to influence how it can be applied to schools. The NEA is developing a task force with educators across the country to address many of these issues. Beyond generative AI Some high schools around the country are\u00a0trying to teach students how to use other forms of artificial intelligence for a greater good. At one prestigious public school in New York City, Stuyvesant High School, students created an app for the blind that uses artificial intelligence and tactile feedback to help people detect threats and navigate obstacles.  Similarly, at STEM School Highlands Ranch in Colorado, a team of students developed an AI-powered\u00a0wildlife detection system called Project Deer to help cut down on car crashes. Although researchers have tried to combat such accidents before, studies have shown wildlife don\u2019t consistently react to any one stimulus. So the students instead derived an AI-based predictive solution to alert the driver to an imminent threat on the road. Using four $5 infrared detection sensors placed on vehicles, the students developed a system for\u00a0AI to scan the surroundings and emit a high-pitched sound when an animal\u2019s body heat is detected, a signal that may help to scare the animal away. The school, which was the\u00a0Colorado State Winner in Samsung\u2019s annual Solve for Tomorrow competition, said it is partnering with the University of Colorado in Boulder this summer to help boost its success rate. The Solve for Tomorrow contest featured more than 1,000 schools submitting STEM-based solutions to real-world problems. Samsung told CNN there was a \u201cdefinite uptick in\u201d submitted AI-powered innovations this year compared to previous years. Computer science teacher Tylor Chacon told CNN the group\u2019s big vision is to one day have the technology regulated or adopted by the state for greater use. School administration has told teachers to help create rubrics or lesson plans, Chacon told CNN. \u201cWe\u2019ve been encouraged to embrace it and look into ways we can use it to maximize our own job effectiveness and ease the burden on us,\u201d he said. It\u2019s an increasingly common trend among teachers to use AI tools to create assignments, quizzes, polls, videos and interactives for classroom use. Some are even turning to AI tools and platforms \u2014 such as ChatGPT, Writable, Grammarly and EssayGrader \u2014 to assist with grading papers or writing feedback, a practice that is also raising ethical considerations. Saving a language, learning the future Still, as schools continue to weigh the benefits or disadvantages to teaching and using artificial intelligence, some teachers and administrators feel strongly that it\u2019s the future. At Princeton High, a group of about 14 students met during school hours for months to build out Che\u2019w\u2019s conversational capabilities, drawn from artificial intelligence neural networks that are trained to recognize patterns, solve problems and understand words, sentences and phrases from spoken and written language. Che\u2019w, which translates to \u201cstar\u201d in Mam, was trained to understand the language by the students so it can serve as a personal tutor. The robot is also trained to speak Spanish and English. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t lose patience or get sick of talking to them,\u201d said Mark Eastburn, Princeton High School\u2019s science, research and engineering teacher. \u201cIt\u2019s taking [AI] off the screen and putting it onto a physical structure that looks like a friend that can help you do whatever you need to do.\u201d In April, the students were one of the top three National Winners at the Samsung Solve For Tomorrow\u2019s competition. AI is now a part of students\u2019 lives, Eastburn said. \u201cAnd it will be there when they\u2019re in college and also in their careers,\u201d he added, \u201cso they might as well learn and use it in appropriate ways in high school, if not even earlier.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/tech/ai-high-school/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "world"}}

During the second round of the PGA Championship though, it was just another hole. Having lost his club to the waters of Kentucky\u2019s Valhalla Golf Club on Friday, the Canadian golfer stood by as one overzealous fan took the plunge to return it to him. As an incredulous \u2013 but nonetheless entertained \u2013 audience of players, caddies and staff watched on, broadcast images showed the spectator strip down to his underwear and socks before paddling the short distance to retrieve the club. Emerging from the lake to applause and a hand up from the club\u2019s owner, the fan was promptly rewarded with a towel to dry himself off before play continued. Yet there was no happy ending to the hole for Hadwin, who went on to make bogey on the par-five. That didn\u2019t stop wife Jessica from making light of events involving her husband. Replying to video of the fan incident on X, she contrasted the bizarre scenes to the \u201cchill little kid free weekend\u201d she had anticipated in Louisville. A one-over-par 72 was enough to see Hadwin through to the weekend at two-under par overall, 10 strokes behind leader Xander Schauffele. How exactly the club ended up in the lake remains unclear, but the one-time PGA Tour winner has previous. At The Players Championship in March, the 36-year-old vented his frustration at finding the water for the first time in his career at \u201cthe fifth major\u201d by hurling his 8-iron into the drink. Hadwin also has a reputation for finding himself in bizarre situations. At last year\u2019s Canadian Open, the world No. 51 was mistakenly leveled by a security guard while celebrating his friend Nick Taylor\u2019s victory. Yet even he won\u2019t have experienced a situation like world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler did on Friday, with the tournament favorite arrested, charged with felony assault and released from jail before stepping up to the tee. Scheffler was given a rousing reception before returning to the clubhouse with a stellar 66, capping a surreal day that saw some fans don t-shirts imprinted with his own mugshot \u2013 one taken at the jail he had warmed up in that morning. \u201cThe fans were tremendous today. I felt like they were cheering extra loud for me,\u201d Scheffler told reporters. \u201cI\u2019ve kept myself in the tournament now with a pretty chaotic day,\u201d he added. \u201cSo I\u2019m going to go from here and focus on getting some rest and recovery and get ready for a grind the last two days.\u201d Once again, Hadwin\u2019s wife Jessica was on hand to lighten the mood, drawing comparisons between the tribulations of Scheffler and her husband. \u201cThere\u2019s only one logical next step after this latest incident,\u201d she wrote on X. \u201cHave you been wrongfully arrested and / or tackled while at your job as a professional golfer?

Microsoft employees, mostly involved with cloud computing, were recently offered the opportunity to work in the United States, Australia or Ireland, among other countries, state-run outlet The Paper said in a report Wednesday, citing an unnamed source. \u201cProviding internal opportunities is a regular part of managing our global business. As part of this process, we shared an optional internal transfer opportunity with a subset of employees,\u201d a Microsoft spokesperson told CNN on Thursday. It did not specify the number of workers who had received the offer. The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that Microsoft asked as many as 800 employees, mostly engineers with Chinese nationality working on cloud computing and AI, to consider relocating. The Journal, which cited unnamed sources, reported last year that the Biden administration was preparing to restrict Chinese firms\u2019 access to US cloud services.

{"id": "2024_05_10_americas_guyana-nigel-dharamlall-sexual-assault-allegations-intl-latam", "text": "A powerful politician in Guyana has been accused of sexual assault for the second time in less than a year, following his resignation last July over separate allegations. The accuser, economist Sarah Aneesah Hakh, told an online press conference held in the capital Georgetown that former Minister Nigel Dharamlall sexually assaulted her in 2020 and 2021. Hakh said the first alleged incident occurred during a business meeting when Dharamlall was Guyana\u2019s senior minister of regional development. \u201cThe fact that he is still in that party is mind boggling to me,\u201d Hakh said. Dharamlall, a Guyanese politician seen as a power broker in the country, was recently appointed to the executive committee of Guyana\u2019s ruling People\u2019s Progressive Party. He has been photographed recently with Guyanese President Irfaan Ali and Vice President Bharrat Jagdeo. Dharamlall rejected the allegations in a statement posted on his Facebook page, saying \u201cI wish to categorically and most vehemently deny each and every one of the allegations made.\u201d He accused Hakh of being on a \u201ccampaign to tarnish my reputation,\u201d claiming that \u201cher demeanor towards me changed fundamentally after I rebuffed her advances and spurned her attempts to engage in an intimate relationship.\u201d CNN has reached out to Dharamlall for comment and has contacted the office of Guyana President Irfaan Ali. Dharamlall resigned from Guyana\u2019s cabinet and parliament last year after an indigenous teenage girl accused him of rape in an unrelated incident, which he has denied. The girl later withdrew the claim according to officials and no charges were filed, President Ali said\u202fin a video statement\u202flast July. He emphasized at the time that his government had \u201callowed the system to work. We have not intervened; from day one,\u201d apparently referencing public criticism over how the girl\u2019s case was handled by authorities. Her withdrawal however was seen by some as a sign of government corruption, with the public speculating her family had been paid off. In a March statement, Guyanese women\u2019s rights group Red Thread criticized officials for failing the accuser. \u201cIt is of great concern that the public nature of this complaint, the powerful political status of the suspect, the discontinuance of the matter at this early stage and the haste with which this investigation was ended, will reinforce the perception of impunity, and inevitably discourage other victims of sexual violence from coming forward,\u201d it wrote. \u2018Violated against my will\u2019 Hakh, who was seen as a rising star in Guyana, said she was first assaulted by Dharamlall during what was supposed to be a meeting about her taking a role as a regional executive officer in September 2020. She alleged that Dharamlall took the then-25-year-old into his bedroom, disrobed and forcibly performed oral sex on her without her consent in the Anna Regina State House, a town on the country\u2019s coast. Hakh told reporters on Friday that she told Dharamlall to stop several times, saying she is a lesbian and \u201cthis is not something I came here expecting to do and can\u2019t offer anything.\u201d \u201cI was violated against my will by a man who exploited my situation and tried to entrap me in a compromising situation due to my future contract with the ministry,\u201d she said. Hakh also alleged that a second incident took place in 2021, in the Cummings Lodge neighborhood on the outskirts of Georgetown, when she says she met Dharamlall to discuss several grievances she had with the ministry of local government. During their meeting, Hakh alleges Dharamlall tried to remove her clothes. Hakh told CNN she didn\u2019t file a police report in 2020 or 2021 due to fears of police corruption and that she would be shunned publicly and within her family, which she says did business with Dharamlall. \u201cI knew I was going up against something that was dangerous and my whole strategy was that if I made a report that was preemptive, and it didn\u2019t go anywhere, I automatically had no credibility,\u201d she told the press conference on Friday, adding that she finally filed a police report on May 9. Hakh said she also filed cyberbullying charges against Dharamlall on May 8.\u202f CNN has contacted Guyanese police for comment. Hakh said she decided to go public with her allegation because \u201cI need to give victims the strength to know that they\u2019re not alone, and that there is no shame in what happened to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/americas/guyana-nigel-dharamlall-sexual-assault-allegations-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_04_16_style_emma-roberts-la-home-architectural-digest", "text": "While many celebrity homes look less than lived-in, ranging from spotless minimal to ostentatiously palatial, actor Emma Roberts\u2019 Hollywood Hills home is made for curling up with a good book \u2014 or several \u2014 with warm tones, comfortable couches, and antique curiosities in each room (also, a lagoon-style pool in the backyard for summer reads). Roberts, an actor who has become a mainstay of rom coms and campy horror \u2014 the latter, most recently with recurring roles in the anthology series \u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d \u2014 bought the home, which she shares with her three-year-old son Rhodes, in 2022 and hired the design firm Pierce & Ward to overhaul its interiors. In the May issue of Architectural Digest, she reveals the results of that makeover. For Roberts, having a space that feels like home is a particular priority, she explained, as she moved often as a child. So when she saw the property listed as a rental on Instagram (it has been reported as a former residence of Minnie Driver), she inquired if she could purchase it instead. \u201cI think I lived in 10 houses by the time I was 15 \u2014 so for me now, having a son, I wanted a place that felt really ours.\u201d she told AD. \u201cI have a picture of the day we moved in\u2026 I just remember feeling like we are exactly where we need to be.\u201d The designers, Louisa Pierce and Emily Ward, with whom Roberts had previously worked, are known for down-to-earth spaces that mix bohemian, mid-century modern and rustic styles. Their clients have included Roberts\u2019 \u201cMadame Web\u201d co-star Dakota Johnson as well as Kate Hudson and Leonardo DiCaprio. \u201cWe want a house to look like it\u2019s been there for 50 years,\u201d Pierce told AD in the cover story. \u201cWe never want a home to look new.\u201d In that spirit, much of Roberts\u2019 furniture, art and decor is repurposed or reupholstered. In the living room, beneath a disco ball-like globe light, paperbacks are enclosed in living room cabinets while rarer books are openly displayed. Framed photographs of Debbie Harry and Joni Mitchell rest on wooden cabinets; elsewhere, one of Roberts\u2019 most treasured artworks \u2014 a Julian Wasser portrait of Joan Didion in front of a Corvette \u2014 hangs on the wall. Though many pieces are courtesy of design studios or antique finds, Pierce and Ward don\u2019t look down on more accessible commercial brands. Roberts recalled when she asked if her new kitchen island was custom-made, they laughed and said it was from Urban Outfitters. As for a room for Rhodes, who is starting his own book collection, Roberts opted for a soothing wallpaper scene of flying ducks on the ceiling, above a lush forest-themed upholstered bed. \u201cI remember as a kid, whatever\u2019s on your wall and your ceiling is seared into your brain for the rest of your life,\u201d Roberts explained. \u201cSo I wanted to make it extra cozy and fun, but not too overwhelming.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/16/style/emma-roberts-la-home-architectural-digest/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_uk_queen-camilla-royal-warrants-intl-scli-gbr", "text": "Queen Camilla\u00a0has granted her first royal warrants to seven companies, including Shane Connolly, the designer behind\u00a0the floral arrangements at\u00a0last year\u2019s Coronation\u00a0and the King and Queen\u2019s 2005 wedding, as well as the upmarket central London department store Fortnum & Mason. The seven companies chosen by Camilla are among 145 previously selected by King Charles III when he was Prince of Wales, which have now had their warrants renewed following his ascent to the throne. Royal warrants act as a stamp of approval to indicate the preferred goods and services used by the royal household and senior members of the royal family. So, if you want to know where Charles and Camilla go hat shopping or buy their wine or organic meat from, it\u2019s worth checking out which companies made the cut. The use of royal warrants can be traced back to medieval times when Henry II first granted a Royal Charter to the Weavers\u2019 Company, according to the Royal Warrants Holders Association. In the 15th century, the first official royal warrants were granted, including to the King\u2019s printer, William Caxton. Selected companies are given permission to use the royal coat of arms on their packaging, vehicles and advertising for five years. Today, the act of officially endorsing particular brands remains one of the last remaining powers of the British monarchy not influenced by Parliament. Brand finance expert David Haigh says that customers are willing to pay between 12% and 24% extra for brands that have a royal warrant, according to research carried out by his consultancy last year. \u201cThere is no doubt that once you get a royal warrant, it does make a difference, day-to-day on the street when people are buying your products and when it comes to the sale of a company,\u201d he told CNN. They can also benefit British companies on the international stage, Haigh added. \u201cThere are plenty of situations where British brands are forging ahead in places like America, the Middle East, China, and having a royal warrant definitely helps.\u201d Royal warrants are given to a wide range of individuals and companies in various sectors, from agriculture and conservation to office supplies and clothing. Other companies on the King and Queen\u2019s latest list include Wartski, a London-based jewelry business, Corgi Hosiery Ltd, a Welsh independent sock manufacturer, and Camel Valley, a vineyard in Cornwall trusted to make sparkling wines for the royals. \u201cHer Majesty has taken a keen interest in the development of English wines,\u201d said Bob Lindo, managing director of Camel Valley, adding that she has been \u201ca terrific source of encouragement and enthusiasm.\u201d \u201cTo now have been appointed as one of her first warrant holders is very special,\u201d he said. Getting the royal seal of approval takes several years and involves a tough application process. \u201cIf you have been offering your goods to one of the royal palaces that grant these things for more than five years continuously, you are eligible to apply,\u201d Haigh says. This year there was a \u201crigorous focus on acting for a sustainable future,\u201d according to Tom Athron, CEO of Fortnum & Mason, the luxury London-based food and drinks store which was granted one of Camilla\u2019s first royal warrants. Haigh has also noticed this shift towards good environmental practice. \u201cIt seems quite clear that if there are any [Environmental, Social and Governance] problems with the company, they will not get a royal warrant,\u201d he said. \u201cNow that actually creates a bit of a double whammy of benefit to those companies. If someone in the royal family uses your product, they like it and they think it\u2019s good, that\u2019s one thing. If on the other hand they are endorsing the fact that you have high standards of ESG, in the current world, that is worth its weight in gold.\u201d ", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/uk/queen-camilla-royal-warrants-intl-scli-gbr/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_middleeast_egypt-warns-israel-dire-repercussions-rafah-operation-mime-intl", "text": "Egypt could consider downgrading relations with Israel if it presses on with a military operation in Gaza\u2019s southernmost city of Rafah on the Egyptian border, an Egyptian official told CNN. \u201cEverything is possible and is on the table, including the downgrade of the relations. But we are not there yet. We are talking to the Israelis, trying to explain and reach a consensus,\u201d the official said. The official said that coordination between the two countries on the Rafah operation, which Egypt has publicly opposed, \u201cdidn\u2019t go well. And that\u2019s why we warned Israel of dire repercussions.\u201d CNN has reached out to the Israeli foreign ministry for comment. The Wall Street Journal earlier reported that Egypt was considering downgrading ties with Israel. The two countries had been at loggerheads this week after Israel began a limited military operation in Rafah last week and seized the Palestinian side of the border with Egypt. Egypt subsequently refused to coordinate aid deliveries into Gaza with Israel. The official told CNN earlier that aid deliveries to Palestinians could be halted because Egypt can\u2019t guarantee the safety of its trucks, as they may come under attack by Palestinian militants targeting Israeli troops. The top diplomats in both countries traded blame over the closure of the Rafah crossing as aid deliveries through the key land crossing halted. Rafah had been the entry point for nearly a quarter of the relief entering the Gaza Strip before Israel\u2019s operation. On Tuesday, the US State Department warned that only 50 humanitarian aid trucks made it through to Gaza on Sunday, down from hundreds per day in previous weeks, adding that the number is \u201cnot nearly enough.\u201d Israel placed the blame for the crossing\u2019s closure on Egypt. In a statement on X, Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz on Tuesday said he had spoken to UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron and German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock \u201cabout the need to persuade Egypt to reopen the Rafah crossing to allow the continued delivery of international humanitarian aid to Gaza.\u201d The Israeli minister\u2019s comments drew backlash from Egypt\u2019s foreign minister, Sameh Shoukry, who rejected Katz\u2019 statement, calling it a \u201cpolicy of distorting the facts.\u201d Shoukry stated Egypt\u2019s \u201ccategorical rejection of the policy of distorting the facts and disavowing responsibility followed by the Israeli side,\u201d adding that Katz\u2019s remarks are \u201cdesperate attempts by Israel to hold Egypt responsible for the unprecedented humanitarian crisis facing the Gaza Strip.\u201d The crisis, Shoukry said, \u201cis a direct result of indiscriminate Israeli attacks against the Palestinians for more than seven months.\u201d Israel has said that it will never let Hamas take control of the border crossing. The Egyptian official told CNN that Egypt didn\u2019t want Hamas to be in control either, but that Israeli control is also unacceptable. \u201cIt needs to be in the hands of the Palestinians,\u201d the official said, adding that the crossing could be placed under the control of the Palestinian civil defense. \u201cThese are neither Hamas nor Fatah (a rival party to Hamas).\u201d Israeli troops at the Egyptian border Adding to tensions are Israeli military movements that have seen the Jewish state\u2019s tanks and soldiers operating on Egypt\u2019s doorstep, causing outrage in Egyptian media for alleged violations of the 1979 peace treaty signed between the two countries. Israeli troops have crossed into an area that was demilitarized in that treaty four decades ago \u2013 including parts of a border zone known as the Philadelphi Corridor, where the Rafah crossing lies. Videos released by the Israeli military last week showed Israeli flags raised on the Palestinian side of the frontier. The Philadelphi Corridor is a 14-kilometer (about 8.7 mile) long and 100-meter-wide strip of land running along the border between Gaza and Egypt. The corridor is key to the 1979 treaty, a pact that saw Egypt and Israel end their enmity and which restricted the number of troops each side can place near the other\u2019s territory. Changes to the security presence in the area must be made with mutual agreement. Over the years, amendments to security agreements between Egypt and Israel have allowed Cairo to boost its security presence in the Sinai Peninsula, which borders Israel. Israel has not disclosed the scale of its military presence in Rafah. But according to the 1979 peace treaty, which was drawn up before Israel unilaterally withdrew troops from Gaza in 2005, Israel is allowed a limited force of four infantry battalions in Zone D \u2013 where the Philadelphi Corridor lies.

{"id": "2024_05_13_europe_russia-putin-reshuffle-shoigu-belousov-intl", "text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s weekend government shakeup appears to be the triumph of competence over loyalty: The Kremlin leader has replaced his camping-and-fishing buddy head of the country\u2019s\u00a0defense\u00a0ministry\u00a0with\u00a0someone widely seen as a competent technocrat. That, at least, seems to be the immediate takeway after the Kremlin announced that Andrey Belousov, a civilian economist and former first deputy prime minister, would take over the top slot at the Russian Ministry\u00a0of Defense\u00a0from\u00a0Sergei Shoigu, who had served in the post since 2012. Alexandra Prokopenko, a former adviser at Russia\u2019s Central Bank, put the shakeup down to the growing interrelationship between the war and Russia\u2019s economy. \u201cPutin\u2019s priority is war; war of attrition is won by economics,\u201d Prokopenko wrote in a thread on X. \u201cBelousov is in favor of stimulating demand from the budget, which means that military spending will at least not decrease but rather increase.\u201d Such a move makes sense when one views the war in Ukraine as a contest between the defense manufacturers of the West, which supplies Ukraine with ammunition and military hardware, and those of Russia. US and NATO officials already concede that Russia is massively outproducing the West when it comes to production of artillery ammunition:\u00a0NATO intelligence estimates of Russian defense production shared with CNN indicate that Russia produces roughly\u00a0three times more artillery shells per year\u00a0than the US and Europe for Ukraine. Having a competent economic manager at the top of the defense ministry can be an asset for Putin, especially when the US Congress has finally turned on the taps of more military aid to Ukraine and\u00a0as\u00a0Russia\u00a0presses\u00a0forward with a new advance along Ukraine\u2019s northeastern border. Whether that advance represents a new front for Russia or an effort to divert Ukrainian forces remains unclear, but it puts more pressure on Kyiv as its allies rush to deliver more weaponry. The appointment of Belousov could also represent house-cleaning at the Ministry of Defense. In recent weeks, the ministry has been hit by a corruption scandal that led to the sacking and arrest of a former deputy to Shoigu. A game of musical chairs Prokopenko,\u00a0who is one of the most perceptive observers of the Russian economy, described Belousov as \u201cwell-versed in military-industrial complex matters\u201d in her thread on X,\u00a0adding that\u00a0he \u201cembodies\u00a0Stolypin-esque statesmanship,\u201d a reference to the reformist Prime Minister Pyotr Stolypin, who led an effort to overhaul and modernize Russia\u2019s inefficient economy after its humiliating military defeat by Japan in 1905. But the reality may be more complex. Putin has shifted Shoigu sideways to a post as the secretary of Russia\u2019s Security Council, meaning that Shoigu is not completely out of the picture. Discussing Shoigu\u2019s new appointment, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the former defense minister would remain immersed in matters of military production.\u00a0But\u00a0competent management of the wartime economy\u00a0is now\u00a0key: Peskov noted that defense spending is approaching 7% of Russian GDP, close to the level seen in the Soviet Union in the mid-1980s, when military priorities and central planning strangled the consumer economy and stifled technological innovation. \u201cToday on the battlefield, the winner is the one who is more open to innovation,\u201d\u00a0Peskov said in\u00a0a call with reporters\u00a0Sunday.\u00a0\u201cAnd therefore, it is natural that at the current stage, the president decided that the Russian Ministry of Defense should be headed by a civilian.\u201d The appointment of a civilian to the defense ministry, then, does not signal a less hawkish approach to the war in Ukraine. General Valery Gerasimov, the chief of Russia\u2019s General Staff and one of the architects of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, remains in place. The top echelons of power remain committed to Putin\u2019s brand of personalistic rule \u2014 and Putin\u2019s goal of subjugating Ukraine. Nevertheless, the newest government shakeup does hint at a\u00a0potential future\u00a0power struggle among Russia\u2019s\u00a0elite. With Shoigu\u2019s new appointment, Nikolai\u00a0Patrushev, the previous\u00a0Secretary of the Security Council, was relieved of his position and is \u201cdue to a transfer to another job,\u201d according to Peskov. Patrushev represents a class known as the\u00a0siloviki\u00a0\u2014 the men of power who graduated from the ranks of the Soviet security services. A former head of the Federal Security Service, or FSB, Patrushev has been one of the more hardline members of Putin\u2019s inner circle. And the Patrushev family name has often come up in speculation about who\u00a0may be\u00a0next in line\u00a0to\u00a0the throne after Putin dies \u2014 because, as the Russian president begins a fifth term of office, smart money has him staying on as president-for-life. Putin has no clear successor (if he dies or is incapacitated while in office, his duties will be assumed temporarily by Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin), but Kremlin-watchers keep a running list of potential aspirants for a successor. Dmitry Patrushev, the son of the former security council chief, is sometimes described as one of the \u201cprincelings\u201d who are waiting; the younger Patrushev was just made a deputy prime minister in the latest reshuffle. Despite the changes at the top,\u00a0there is no sense that the overall goals\u00a0of the Kremlin \u2014 pursuing the war on Ukraine and continuing a confrontation with the West \u2014\u00a0have changed. \u201cPutin\u2019s primary objective is to enhance the state\u2019s capacity to support military needs more effectively, while most elements of the existing \u2018structure\u2019 will stay intact,\u201d wrote political observer Tatiana Stanovaya, the founder and CEO of the analytical group R.Politik, on X. So the music may be spinning faster inside the Kremlin, but the same loyal contenders are playing musical chairs.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/europe/russia-putin-reshuffle-shoigu-belousov-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_17_tech_voice-actors-ai-lawsuit-lovo", "text": "Voice actor Paul Skye Lehrman took a job in 2020 for which he believed he was providing a set of one-off voice samples. Years later, he says he heard his voice narrating a YouTube video and then on a podcast \u2014 even though he had never recorded either of them. Now, Lehrman, along with fellow voice actor Linnea Sage, is suing AI firm Lovo for allegedly commissioning them for voice projects under false pretenses in order to create and sell AI-generated versions of their voices. The Berkeley, California based tech company advertises AI-generated voice technology to be used in marketing, education and product demos. Lehrman and Sage are suing Lovo and seeking class action status to include other people \u201cwhose voices and/or identities were stolen and used,\u201d according to the complaint filed Thursday in the Southern District Court of New York. The complaint was first reported by the New York Times. The voice actors\u2019 lawsuit is just the latest in a recent string of legal actions brought against various tech companies by creatives, writers and artists who say their work was used without their permission to train AI systems that could ultimately compete with them. Such lawsuits have added to a growing wave of concerns over how the training of AI models, which requires huge swaths of data, could run afoul of copyright and intellectual property laws. \u201cImplicit in LOVO\u2019s offerings to its customers is that each voice-over actor has agreed to LOVO\u2019s terms and conditions for customers to be able to access that actor\u2019s voice,\u201d the complaint states. But for Lehrman and Sage and any others \u201cwho have not agreed to LOVO\u2019s terms, the continued unauthorized use of Plaintiffs\u2019 voices is theft of service and misappropriation.\u201d Lovo did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit. In May 2020, Lehrman says he received a request for voice-over narrative services on the gig work website Fiverr from an account called \u201cUser25199087.\u201d When he asked what the voice sample was for, he was told it would be used \u201cfor academic research purposes only\u201d and that \u201cthe scripts would not be used for anything else,\u201d according to the complaint. He was paid $1,200 for the job, the complaint states. Two years later, Lehrman came across a YouTube video that sounded as if it had his voice narrating it, although he\u2019d never been involved in its creation, the complaint states. Then in June 2023, Lehrman claims he heard his voice being used on a podcast about the dangers of AI technologies. Similarly, Sage was offered a job on Fiverr in 2019 producing \u201ctest scripts for radio ads\u201d that she was told would \u201cnot be disclosed externally,\u201d according to the complaint. She was paid $400. Sage says she later also discovered her voice in a YouTube video: a recording of a Lovo investor presentation demonstrating its technology. Lehrman and Sage allege that the people who contacted them on Fiverr were Lovo employees who misrepresented what their voice samples would be used for and later sold or raised money on the back of the AI-version of their voices. \u201cTo be clear, the product that customers purchase from LOVO is stolen property. They are voices stolen by LOVO and marketed by LOVO under false pretenses,\u201d the complaint states. The actors are seeking more than $5 million in damages, as well as a court order blocking Lovo from continuing the alleged use of their voices.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/tech/voice-actors-ai-lawsuit-lovo/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "world"}}

Some passersby even joined emergency services to run inside the burning building and help carry large Renaissance paintings and other objects away from the blaze. Among the paintings saved was Danish artist Peder Severin Kr\u00f8yer\u2019s 1895 work \u201cFrom the Copenhagen Stock Exchange,\u201d the Chamber of Commerce said. Denmark\u2019s Deputy Prime Minister, Troels Lund Poulsen, called the fire \u201cour own Notre Dame moment,\u201d referring to the blaze that destroyed the roof and spire of the Paris cathedral, five years ago almost to the day. The fire began at around 8.30 a.m. local time (2.30 a.m. ET), a Copenhagen fire department chief told CNN, and by 11 a.m. nearly half of the building had been destroyed. The fire was still burning by late afternoon. The Chamber of Commerce said it is \u201cat a loss for words for how great a tragedy this is.\u201d It said it was \u201ca sad day for our country\u201d and that \u201cthe damage will unfortunately be very expensive.\u201d \u201cWe have tried to rescue a lot of historic paintings that were inside the building and the historic furniture,\u201d Jakob Vedsted Andersen, an executive director at the Greater Copenhagen fire and rescue service, told CNN. He said it was \u201cway too soon\u201d to speculate about the causes of the blaze. Copenhagen police have told people to avoid the area and there have been no reported injuries so far. People were in the building when the fire started but they were all evacuated, said a police spokesperson who added that military personnel were at the scene to support fire-fighting efforts. A \u201cpiece of Danish history\u201d is on fire, Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said, calling the building\u2019s cultural heritage \u201cirreplaceable.\u201d The B\u00f8rsen building has been at the heart of Danish business since the 17th century. The old stock exchange \u2013 located only a few minutes walk from Christiansborg\u00a0Palace \u2013 dates back to 1625. It was built in the Dutch Renaissance style at the request of King Christian IV and had recently been undergoing renovations with its facade covered in scaffolding and protective coverings. Denmark\u2019s culture minister Jakob Engel-Schmidt said 400 years of cultural heritage had been damaged. \u201cHow touching it is to see how the employees at B\u00f8rsen, good people from the emergency services and passers-by work together to rescue art treasures and iconic images from the burning building,\u201d he added in a post on X, formerly Twitter. Emergency services were working to control the fire but it had spread to all floors through the elevator shaft. Frank Trier Mikkelsen, operations manager at the Greater Copenhagen fire department, said the fire is burning \u201cviolently\u201d inside the building, according to TV 2, a government-owned TV channel. Forty firefighters were inside the building, with valuables being rescued, TV 2 reported. Mikkelsen told the Danish broadcaster that the fire is of a type that emergency managers dread, explaining parts of the building\u2019s roof need to be removed to extinguish it. He added machines have been called in to remove some of the copper roof, as the water just bounces off it.

Firefighters battling more than 100 blazes across the country could see temporary relief in some regions as a large mid-week storm tracks through western and central Canada, bringing increased chances of rain and blasts of cooler air. Even so, several volatile fires are raging within miles of neighborhoods. Fire officials warn slight changes in weather conditions or wind direction could quickly place nearby homes and businesses at risk. More than 6,000 people have evacuated from Fort McMurray in Alberta since Tuesday as a 51,000 acre fire burns less than 5 miles from the city\u2019s edge. Residents should plan to be away from their homes until at least May 21, possibly longer, the regional municipality said. The fire near Fort McMurray was still active Wednesday, but winds were expected to begin pushing the blaze away from the city and its major highway, Alberta Wildfire Information Officer Josee St-Onge said. Rain showers are forecast to begin in the area Wednesday night and drop up to 1 inch of rain through tomorrow. Around-the-clock firefighting efforts have helped keep the flames at bay, including water helicopters equipped with night vision. Firefighters \u2013 some of them defending their own communities \u2013 have also been pulling grueling and dangerous shifts. \u201cTo the firefighters braving the flames to defend Fort McMurray and other areas of the province, we appreciate your heroic efforts more than we can say and we pray for your safe return,\u201d Alberta Premier Danielle Smith said Wednesday. For many Fort McMurray residents, the smoke-blackened skies and anxious evacuations recall painful memories of a catastrophic 2016 fire dubbed \u201cThe Beast,\u201d which forced 90,000 people to evacuate and wrought billions of dollars in damage to homes and businesses. Resident Jocelyn Routhier, whose neighborhood has yet to be ordered to evacuate, has watched from her back porch as the scene grows eerily similar to the previous disaster. She shared two uncanny pictures of the fires taken eight years apart. \u201cThis is a d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu that I would rather not experience. Let\u2019s hope it doesn\u2019t turn into a reality,\u201d Routhier said in social media post alongside the images. \u2018It\u2019s hard to think anything but the worst\u2019 New fires are cropping up every day across Canada and several out-of-control blazes are threatening populous neighborhoods, prompting scores of evacuating residents to look for lodging in hotels, emergency shelters and camp and RV sites. Mackenzie Spenrath is among the nearly 5,000 people ordered to evacuate the Fort Nelson area in British Columbia, where the 31,000-acre Parker Lake Fire is burning just 1.5 miles from the community. He told CNN affiliate CBC he has become consumed with watching the news and scrolling social media \u201ctrying to figure out if my town is still standing.\u201d  Fort Nelson fire crews may be aided by under an inch of rain forecast Wednesday night and through Thursday evening. But that is far from the amount of precipitation needed to offset drought conditions and extinguish the fires, the British Columbia Wildfire Service said. \u201cIt\u2019s not entirely hopeless, obviously. But the fire is just so close to town that it\u2019s hard to think anything but the worst,\u201d Spenrath said. Extraordinarily dry conditions are also posing challenges for fire personnel battling a blaze that has come within a mile of the Cranberry Portage community in western Manitoba. About 580 people have been evacuated and there is no estimated time for their return. \u201cBecause the conditions are so extremely dry up there, the fires burned down deep,\u201d Earl Simmons, the director of the Manitoba Wildfire Service, told CBC. \u201cSo the firefighters have to get in there and dig really deep into the ground to put it out. And we\u2019re not just talking a few inches, we\u2019re talking meters into the ground in spots.\u201d The dry conditions driving Canada\u2019s wildfires are aggravated by warming conditions caused by human-driven climate change. \u201cThis region has experienced multiple years of drought, with a below normal snowpack this past winter,\u201d said Ben Boghean, fire behavior specialist for the BC Wildfire Service. \u201cAs a result of this, our forests in the Fort Nelson zone are very receptive\u00a0to new fire ignitions and rapid rates of spread.\u201d Declining snow, increasing temperatures and worsening droughts are all hallmarks of climate change and are projected to keep driving larger and more intense fires across Canada,\u00a0according to Environment Canada.

Ariff had traveled from his home in Singapore to Kazakhstan to attend the wedding of an old friend. This friend, like Ariff, had grown up in Malaysia. They\u2019d been close back in the day, but lost touch when Ariff moved to the UK in early adulthood. When Ariff relocated to Singapore, the two friends reconnected, and then the wedding invite followed. Ariff was touched and honored to make the guest list. Plus, his friend\u2019s soon-to-be wife was from Kazakhstan \u2013 the couple had met in Kuala Lumpur \u2013 and the celebrations were set to take place in Kazakhstan\u2019s largest city: Almaty. A keen traveler, Ariff never turned down the opportunity to explore somewhere new. Right away, he RSVPed \u201cyes.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d been to Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan before, and I thought, \u2018I\u2019ve not been to Kazakhstan. When else am I going to go?\u201d Ariff tells CNN Travel today. Ariff\u2019s friend was delighted that Ariff could make his celebrations. But before the big day, the friend took Ariff aside and gave him a firm warning. \u201cThe bridesmaid\u201d was his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s cousin. Ariff\u2019s friend wanted to avoid a potentially messy family situation, especially as he figured Ariff wasn\u2019t after anything serious. \u201cListen,\u201d said Ariff\u2019s friend. \u201cI know you don\u2019t want to get married. And I don\u2019t want to have any problems later, with my extended family. So just give her a wide berth, OK?\u201d Ariff laughed, but he agreed. Anyway, he wasn\u2019t going to the wedding to meet women \u2013 he just wanted to cheer on his friend on his big day, and experience a new country and culture. In the week leading up to the wedding, the bride and groom planned daily activities for their wedding guests \u2013 many of whom, like Ariff, were in Kazakhstan for the first time. Ariff liked Almaty right away. He recalls thinking the city seemed like \u201ca great mix of old Soviet architecture and modern shiny buildings, quiet alleys and parks, and busy bars and restaurants.\u201d \u201cIt is surrounded by beautiful mountains,\u201d he adds. \u201cWe had the chance to stay in a chalet up there for a few days, where the views were absolutely breathtaking.\u201d Then, the night before the wedding, Ariff attended a dinner hosted by the bride\u2019s side of the family. And that\u2019s when he saw Liliya Dauletaliyeva for the first time. \u201cI remember Lili walked in,\u201d says Ariff. She stood out to him right away. \u201cShe was wearing a check shirt. All the other girls were wearing evening dresses.\u201d Over dinner, Liliya was friendly, chatty and at the center of most of the conversations. To Ariff, she projected self-confidence. \u201cShe was doing the translating, between Russian and English, for everybody\u2019s benefit,\u201d Ariff recalls. But when Liliya approached Ariff and tried to make conversation, Ariff made only noncommittal, vague and decidedly awkward responses. He really wanted to talk to Liliya, find out more about her. But Ariff\u2019s friend\u2019s warning was ringing round his head. Because Liliya was \u2013 of course, inevitably \u2013 the bridesmaid Ariff had been warned to stay away from. First impressions Back in 2018, Liliya Dauletaliyeva, born and raised in Almaty, was in her early 20s and living in the Kazakh capital of Astana. She\u2019d recently finished up her bachelor\u2019s degree and enrolled in a master\u2019s program. Liliya was firmly focused on her studies and \u201cnot planning to get married\u201d any time soon. When she wasn\u2019t working late in the library, Liliya was planning future travels. She loved exploring the world, and prioritized adventures whenever she could. She\u2019d just got back from a trip to Iceland, and was looking forward to her cousin\u2019s wedding partly because she\u2019d get to meet a bunch of people from across the world. At the pre-wedding dinner, Liliya noticed her cousin\u2019s fianc\u00e9 only had a couple of friends who\u2019d flown in for the celebrations. One of the guys seemed outgoing and talkative. The other \u2013 Ariff \u2013 seemed more reserved. Liliya wondered if he was shy, or perhaps nervous. \u201cI know a lot of people, their first impression of Kazakhstan, it might be a bit of a cultural shock,\u201d Liliya tells CNN Travel. \u201cSo I thought that he must be feeling a bit weird \u2013 or maybe even awkward because he just reconnected with his friend that he hadn\u2019t seen for ages.\u201d Liliya tried to talk to Ariff to make him feel \u201cmore comfortable.\u201d But she approached him, his eyes widened and he seemed even more awkward than before. \u201cI didn\u2019t talk back,\u201d says Ariff. \u201cI had instructions to follow.\u201d The wedding the next day was \u201can almost 12-hour affair,\u201d as Ariff recalls. \u201cA Kazah wedding is very different from a Southeast Asian wedding,\u201d he says. \u201cA lot of drinks and a lot of dancing.\u201d It was a great day, and when the celebrations wrapped up at around 1 a.m., the party continued at a nearby hotel. \u201cThere was a huge karaoke venue at that hotel,\u201d says Liliya. \u201cAnd so all the young people \u2013 the bridesmaids and the friends and family, we all went there.\u201d That\u2019s how, in the early hours of the morning, Ariff and Liliya found themselves sitting side by side in the karaoke bar. \u201cAnd that\u2019s when we started talking, \u201c says Liliya. \u201cAfter all this singing and drinking and dancing. We just sat down and talked.\u201d After \u201ceight or nine hours of drinking\u201d Ariff was no longer preoccupied about his friend\u2019s warning. \u201cThe instructions went out the window,\u201d he says. Connecting at 1 a.m. At first, Liliya and Ariff talked about Kazakhstan. Liliya asked Ariff what he thought of her home country, commenting that Ariff seemed to be one of very few friends of the groom who\u2019d traveled for the wedding. \u201cWhy did you decide to come?\u201d she asked him. \u201cI know many people are like, \u2018Oh Kazakhstan, what is this place? Why would we go there?\u2019\u201d \u201cI like adventures,\u201d said Ariff. \u201cI love traveling and exploring new countries.\u201d Ariff mentioned the wedding invite had come through when he was planning a trip to Iceland. He\u2019d abandoned those plans, and prioritized Kazakhstan instead. \u201cI told him that I just came back from Iceland a couple of months before,\u201d recalls Liliya. \u201cWe realized that we both love traveling. And then just started talking about all these adventures and travel plans, where we want to go\u2026\u201d Liliya and Ariff spent the rest of the evening deep in conversation, but parted ways without exchanging contact details. Still, Ariff was hopeful they might see each other again \u2013 following the Kazak wedding, Ariff\u2019s friend and Liliya\u2019s cousin had a second wedding celebration planned in Malaysia in a few weeks time. Ariff figured Liliya, as a bridesmaid, would likely be there, although he didn\u2019t know for sure. \u201cI couldn\u2019t stop thinking about her,\u201d he said. \u201cI tried to figure out how to contact her without obviously asking my friend or his wife for help \u2013 because, you know, the instructions were to stay away from the cousin.\u201d In the end, Ariff tracked Liliya down on Facebook and dropped her a friend request and a message: \u201cHey, I hear you\u2019re coming to Malaysia this weekend for the second leg of the wedding,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf you\u2019d like to hang out or something, here\u2019s my number.\u201d \u201cAnd then we did hang out,\u201d says Ariff. It was a fun few days \u2013 Ariff showed Liliya his favorite places in Kuala Lumpur and recalls that they \u201cwere quite excited to see each other.\u201d Still, it wasn\u2019t obvious where their connection would go from there. \u201cI\u2019m not a fan of long distance,\u201d says Liliya. \u201cI kept thinking, \u2018Maybe we can be friends.\u2019\u201d Taking a risk Before she left Malaysia, Liliya \u2013 on a whim \u2013 invited Ariff to come and visit Kazakhstan again, in a month\u2019s time, for her 24th birthday party. \u201cI obviously sat on the decision for about a week and a half, because I thought, \u2018I\u2019ve just been there,\u2019\u201d recalls Ariff. He remembers turning the idea over in his mind. Ariff really liked Liliya and wanted to see her again. But traveling across the world on a bit of a whim seemed \u201ccrazy.\u201d \u201cI was kind of hesitating to go, because I thought, \u2018This is insanity,\u2019\u201d says Ariff. Ariff mentioned the dilemma to an older family friend whose opinion he trusted. Ariff\u2019s confidant told him that, some 40 years ago he\u2019d \u201cmissed an opportunity with a girl\u201d and still regretted it to that day. \u201cHe was like, \u2018Don\u2019t be me. Go and live your life,\u2019\u201d Ariff recalls. So Ariff put aside his hesitations and embarked on the 19-hour journey to visit Liliya. \u201cI took three planes,\u201d he recalls. \u201cSingapore to Bangkok, Bangkok to Almaty, Almaty to Astana.\u201d \u201cI remember I went to pick him up from the airport,\u201d Liliya says. \u201cI was so nervous. I called my friends and I was like, \u2018I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing. Why did I even agree to that? What did I sign up for? This guy, I only saw him for like, four or five days.\u2019\u201d Liliya wondered what she and Ariff were going to talk about, what were they going to do together, would it be awkward? But as soon as they were together again, Liliya and Ariff\u2019s respective worries melted away. \u201cWe literally spent every single day together. He stayed for 10 days. And every minute that I was not in school, we tried to spend together,\u201d says Liliya. \u201cIt was so much fun.\u201d Liliya also felt heartened that Ariff had followed through \u2013 she\u2019d invited him, he\u2019d said he\u2019d come, and then he did. \u201cI was pleasantly surprised,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI was like, \u2018That\u2019s the person that keeps his word, that you can rely on.\u2019 I started thinking, \u2018I wouldn\u2019t mind starting a relationship with a person like this.\u2019\u201d Deciding on the future By the end of the 10 days, both Liliya and Ariff were certain about their future. \u201cThat first trip, we decided we were going to get married,\u201d says Ariff. It wasn\u2019t really a formal conversation, says Liliya: \u201cWe were just having dinner and talking.\u201d Neither of them had been looking for love, let alone marriage. But after meeting each other, Ariff and Liliya were sure they wanted to be together, and to commit to a life side by side. They knew the whole thing was \u201cpretty nuts,\u201d as Ariff puts it today. But they were confident in their feelings and in each other. A month later, in October, Liliya went with Ariff to visit his parents in Malaysia. That Christmas, Ariff\u2019s mother invited Liliya on a family trip to the UK. Ariff\u2019s parents liked Liliya right away \u2013 and, certain marriage was on the cards, Ariff\u2019s mother suggested she and Liliya go shopping for wedding dresses while they were in London. Lilya and Ariff wanted to avoid extended periods of long distance, so around this time Liliya decided to quit her master\u2019s degree and move to Singapore to be with Ariff. \u201cObviously my family didn\u2019t approve,\u201d says Liliya. \u201cBut I thought, \u2018You know what, I can get my master\u2019s in Malaysia or Singapore, and that\u2019s probably an even better option. It\u2019s not a big deal.\u2019\u201d In general Liliya and Ariff\u2019s friends and loved ones were supportive, but a little concerned about the speed at which the romance was moving. \u201cIt was really fast,\u201d admits Liliya. \u201cSome of my friends, they\u2019re still shocked. They\u2019re like, \u2018He hadn\u2019t even proposed and his mom took you to pick a wedding dress.\u2019\u201d Liliya and Ariff shrugged off the concerns, and in December 2018, Liliya moved to Singapore. A couple of months later, Ariff formally proposed, on Valentine\u2019s Day 2019. The couple liked the idea of a \u201ca very small, intimate wedding,\u201d says Liliya. \u201cJust friends and family members, somewhere fun.\u201d \u201cMaybe somewhere in the Mediterranean, a bit of a party with friends,\u201d says Ariff. This dream wasn\u2019t to be. \u201cParents had different ideas,\u201d says Ariff, laughing. Ariff and Liliya ended up with several wedding celebrations \u2013 a small ceremony to sign the legal papers in April 2019, followed by a 300-person wedding in Malaysia in the summer \u201cwith a lot of food and alcohol\u201d and another big party in Kazakhstan. Amid all the planning \u2013 and parental negotiations \u2013 Ariff and Liliya took a break and went on a pre-wedding honeymoon. \u201cIt was great to go on a honeymoon before. We picked places where it was very hard to reach us,\u201d says Ariff. The couple returned from their vacation refreshed and ready to enjoy the August 2019 celebrations. Liliya and Ariff Kazakhstan wedding celebration incorporated a number of Kazakh traditions. \u201cWe had \u2018qyz uzatu,\u2019 a Kazakh traditional ceremony where the bride is sent off from her parental home to the groom\u2019s family, marked by a farewell party attended by close relatives and friends,\u201d says Liliya. \u201cThe event includes ceremonial rites, blessings from elders, presenting gifts to the groom\u2019s family, and the singing of traditional Kazakh songs. Parents give their blessings and advice to the bride.\u201d The Malaysian celebration also included \u201crecitations of prayers and blessings, a traditional meal, and an exchange of gifts,\u201d says Liliya. All of the celebrations were \u201ca blast,\u201d says Ariff. There was lots of laughter, and moving moments too. The family friend who encouraged Ariff to take a risk and visit Liliya was one of the witnesses when the couple signed the papers. Meanwhile, friends from across the world came to celebrate with the couple \u2013 including, of course, Ariff\u2019s childhood friend and Liliya\u2019s cousin, who\u2019d unwittingly kicked off Ariff and Liliya\u2019s love story the year before. \u201cI don\u2019t have any siblings, but I grew up with my cousin,\u201d says Liliya. \u201cWe are very close. So obviously she came to both our weddings, and we\u2019re still super close.\u201d Ariff\u2019s friend had forgiven him for breaking his promise to \u201cstay away from the bridesmaid.\u201d But he still worried, right up until the wedding, that it wouldn\u2019t work out. \u201cI think my friend was very stressed until we got married, until we legally signed the papers because he was like, \u2018Please don\u2019t mess it up,\u2019\u201d says Ariff. \u201cNow we\u2019re all part of one big family,\u201d says Liliya. Taking risks together Post-wedding, Liliya and Ariff settled into an easy rhythm in their relationship. The couple \u201cdon\u2019t have many cultural differences,\u201d says Liliya, even though they grew up in different countries. \u201cWe quickly learned that Kazakh and Malay cultures are very similar, both emphasizing the importance of family, traditions, and community,\u201d she says. Still, they like learning new things about each other\u2019s \u201chistory, people, food\u2026\u201d says Liliya. They enjoy sharing these learning moments with one another. After a few years in Singapore, in 2021 Liliya and Ariff moved to Malaysia. And another big shift occurred last year, when Liliya decided to recommence the master\u2019s course she quit back in 2018. \u201cEven after years of working, this idea of me leaving something incomplete kept bothering me, so I decided to apply again,\u201d she says. Liliya was excited to return to academia, but felt the associated upheaval would only be \u201cworth it\u201d if she was attending one of the best universities in the world. That\u2019s how she ended up accepting a place at the University of Oxford, in the UK. Liliya is loving the experience studying there. The only downside is she and Ariff are now contending with the long distance they actively avoided at the start of their relationship. That is slightly \u201cironic,\u201d admits Ariff. But he\u2019s really proud of Liliya and excited for her next career steps. He visits Oxford every month, and is able to work remotely from the UK for significant chunks of time. In between, the couple video chat regularly. \u201cI think it\u2019s actually much easier to have a long distance relationship when you\u2019ve already been in this relationship for quite some time,\u201d says Liliya. The fact Liliya and Ariff both love traveling also makes journeying back and forth a little easier. \u201cWe want to keep exploring the world and experience living in as many countries as possible,\u201d says Liliya, adding they \u201ccan\u2019t imagine their lives without the thrill of new adventures.\u201d \u201cWe like to take risks, both of us, daily,\u201d says Ariff, pointing out that mindset\u2019s woven into their love story. When they first met, they both jumped into the unknown, flying across the world to visit one another, and then deciding to be together, despite the obstacles. Today, Liliya and Ariff find it surreal to think Liliya barely knew Ariff when she moved across the world to be with him. After five years together, they\u2019re just as certain that they made the right choice. And while they know each other much better, they\u2019re still learning new things about each other. Liliya thinks that\u2019s a big part of what it means to be in love with someone. \u201cIt\u2019s just a great feeling when you feel like you just met this person, because you feel like you keep rediscovering, keep learning something new every day,\u201d she says. \u201cIt never gets boring.\u201d \u201cThinking about how all these puzzle pieces, how they all came together \u2013 I just started believing in destiny.

The two attended an event Saturday held by Nigeria\u2019s Defence Staff and \u2018Nigeria: Unconquered\u2019 \u2013 a local charity supporting wounded servicemembers inspired by the Duke of Sussex\u2019s Invictus Games Foundation. After arriving at an officer\u2019s mess late morning local time they were immediately taken to watch a sitting volleyball game. They were given scarves in the green and white colors of Nigeria as they took their seats\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0arena. Harry caused a lot of excitement when he joined in the game \u2013 his Invictus team on one side, the other led by a team of members of the Nigerian military, which won the game 25 to 21. Meghan watched from the side sat next to 9-year-old Tiwatope Akanbi, who told CNN: \u201cI\u2019m so happy I saw Meghan today and I will never forget it all my life.\u201d A group of women who called themselves the Sussex Squad Nigeria surrounded Meghan, saying: \u201cWe love you. Nigeria loves you. Welcome home.\u201d They presented her with a book and a Nigerian fabric. Meghan revealed in 2022 that she discovered she was 43% Nigerian from a genealogy test. Wounded service members shared their thoughts about the importance of the Sussexes visit. \u201cHonestly, Prince Harry and Meghan\u2019s visit to Nigeria, it means a lot to me personally,\u201d flight sergeant Ifeoma Loveleen Nwagbo told CNN. \u201cThis [Invictus] initiative is very, very fantastic because it makes me understand that yes: I can actually achieve what I couldn\u2019t achieve before in my life. And then [Harry] coming to Nigeria \u2013 Wow! I\u2019m just feeling on top of the world, because I will meet him \u2013 it\u2019s fantastic!\u201d she said. Gloria Kisitmwa Dimka, also a flight sergeant, told CNN that the Sussexes\u2019 visit tells wounded soldiers \u201cthat they are being supported and being cared for.\u201d \u201cWe really appreciate it and we are thankful. We thank them for\u2026 all the effort they are putting [in] to put laughter and smiles in the faces of all the sick and the wounded soldiers. This means a lot to us,\u201d she added. The\u00a0Duke and Duchess of Sussex\u00a0landed in\u00a0Nigeria\u00a0on Friday for a three-day private visit to the West African nation. Their first engagement on was an event hosted at a school in the Nigerian capital, Abuja, where Meghan told students: \u201cI see myself in all of you.\u201d Harry asked the children about their knowledge of mental health and reminded them to look after themselves and each other. \u201cWill you promise to us that after today, no more being scared, no more being unsure of mental health. If you are unsure, then ask. Ask your teachers. Ask your friends.

{"id": "2024_05_17_europe_hostages-recovered-gaza-idf-intl", "text": "The Israeli military announced Saturday that it had recovered the body of a hostage from the Gaza Strip, one day after saying it had retrieved the remains of three others in the besieged territory. The hostage was identified as Ron Benjamin, who was killed on October 7 at the Mefalsim intersection during the Hamas attack, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said in a news conference. Benjamin\u2019s body was abducted by Hamas and taken to Gaza, he added. The three previous hostages were identified as Shani Louk, Amit Bouskila, and Itshak Gelernter, Hagari said in a press conference in Tel Aviv on Friday. All three were taken hostage on October 7 and were\u00a0killed while escaping the Nova music festival and their bodies taken into Gaza, the IDF said. \u201cThey were celebrating life in the Nova music festival and they were murdered by Hamas,\u201d he said. The bodies were identified by authorities and the families have been informed, Hagari said, adding that the bodies had been transferred to medical professionals for forensic examination. Hagari did not disclose where the bodies were found during the press conference. He said the bodies were recovered during a joint IDF and Shin Bet operation. CNN analyst and Axios reporter Barak Ravid,\u00a0citing an IDF spokesperson,\u00a0reported\u00a0the bodies were found in a tunnel in Gaza. Nissim Louk, father of Shani Louk whose body was one of those recovered also told Israeli media his daughter\u2019s body was very well preserved because it had been kept in a \u201cdeep and very cold tunnel\u201d. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed his grief in a\u00a0post on X\u00a0on Friday. \u201cThe heart breaks for the great loss. My wife Sara and I grieve with the families. All our hearts are with them in this hour of grieving,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will return all our hostages, the dead and the alive alike. I congratulate our brave forces who, with determined action, have returned our sons and daughters home,\u201d he added. Of the three hostages, only Louk had previously been confirmed dead by the Israeli government. The 23-year-old German-Israeli woman was declared dead by the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs in late October. A source involved with her identification told CNN Louk\u2019s death was announced after forensic examiners found a bone fragment from her skull. Her lifeless body was seen on video on the back of a Hamas truck after the music festival attack. Louk\u2019s family said they feel some closure now that her body has been recovered. In a statement given to CNN, the family said the IDF came to their house on Friday and informed them that they were able to rescue Louk\u2019s body from a tunnel in Gaza and bring her back to Israel. \u201cEvery news like this brings us back to the horrific moment we had to find out that our loving daughter was brutally murdered by Hamas on the 7th of October. However,\u00a0it is also a relief to get the body back and we are now able to bury her close by. It gives us some kind of closure,\u201d the family said. \u201cWe want to remember Shani as the beautiful and peace-loving person she was, who loved music, dancing and life. She brought us and many other people in the world light and the belief in good. This is how we choose to remember Shani,\u201d the statement added. Around 240 people were taken hostage and moved to Gaza during Hamas\u2019 October 7 attack on Israel which also killed more than 1,200 people. In the seven months since that attack, Israel has launched a war in Gaza that has killed\u00a0more than 35,000 Palestinians, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. A little more than 100 hostages were freed during a release deal in November, but the IDF believes there are still 132 hostages being held in Gaza, 128 of whom were taken on October 7. The IDF believed that of those 132 hostages, 40 are believed to be dead, including two who were taken in 2014. A deal to secure the release of the remaining hostages has remained elusive for months, despite rounds of talks between Israeli and Hamas negotiating teams. Last Friday, Hamas militants said Israel\u2019s rejection of a ceasefire plan submitted by mediators at negotiations in Cairo had sent hostage release talks back to \u201csquare one.\u201d The statement came a day after the latest round of Gaza truce and hostage deal talks ended in Cairo, without a deal. The militant group also accused Netanyahu of hindering the ceasefire talks, so as to use negotiations as a cover to attack the southern Gaza city of Rafah.

{"id": "2024_05_13_americas_haiti-mss-unodc-guns-drugs-intl-latam", "text": "On the rare days that the hills surrounding Port-au-Prince fall silent, people notice. \u201cIf you can\u2019t hear shooting somewhere, the gangs are probably running low on ammunition,\u201d a police source in the\u00a0Haitian capital told CNN. \u201cBut when there\u2019s a lot of shooting, they\u2019ve definitely received a fresh shipment.\u201d For over two months, Port-au-Prince has been cut off from the world, its international seaport and airport shuttered following an explosion of gang attacks in late February. All major roads are blocked by gang checkpoints. For most people living here, there is no way out \u2013 and no way to bring in desperately needed food and medicine. Encircling the Caribbean nation is another closed perimeter, this one created by\u00a0Haiti\u2019s neighbors. The Dominican Republic has sealed the island\u2019s shared border and airspace. The Bahamas has launched\u00a0a naval blockade\u00a0to keep\u00a0Haitians from fleeing the crisis by boat; the UK has\u00a0sent a warship\u00a0to ward off anyone seeking refuge in Turks and Caicos, a British overseas territory; and the US state of Florida has\u00a0increased marine and aviation patrols. And yet guns, bullets and drugs keep pouring in, crossing international waters and airspace to reach the embattled country \u2013 most of the firepower originating from the US. \u201cHaiti\u00a0doesn\u2019t produce guns and ammunition, yet the gang members don\u2019t seem to have any trouble accessing those things,\u201d says Pierre Esperance, executive director of\u00a0Haiti\u2019s National Human Rights Defense Network. Since the start of the year, thousands of people have been killed in gang-related violence and hundreds kidnapped, including at least 21 children, UN figures show. Stopping the flow of guns to\u00a0Haiti\u00a0would likely have an immediate impact on the bloodshed, according to police and human rights experts. \u201cWe have to cut the gangs\u2019 weapons supply lines. This is absolutely the most important thing now,\u201d the police source told CNN. \u201cBecause when they don\u2019t have bullets, their machine guns become nothing more than clubs.\u201d And as a Kenyan-led multinational security support force (MSS) prepares to deploy to\u00a0Haiti, starving the gangs of ammunition should be a top priority for the US, says William O\u2019Neill, the UN Designated Expert of the High Commissioner on the situation of Human Rights in Haiti. \u201cAll of these countries that are contributing their young men and women (to the MSS), how can we make it safer for them to do their job? One way the US could help immediately and directly would be to really seriously crack down on the flow of illegal weapons,\u201d he said. \u201cThe gangs have literally nothing else; their only currency is intimidation and fear.\u201d Defying a global arms embargo Eighteen months ago, the UN Security Council imposed\u00a0an arms embargo on\u00a0Haiti, which bans the export of weapons to anyone in the country other than the government. The US has also taken independent steps to crack down on illicit exports, appointing a regional coordinator for firearms prosecution in the Caribbean and a\u00a0special unit\u00a0to investigate transnational crimes in\u00a0Haiti. Yet the guns keep coming. In January, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) warned that\u00a0Haiti-bound firearms and ammunition were being \u201croutinely incorporated into outbound shipments at warehouses near seaports and airports\u201d in Florida, citing interviews with US customs officials. The following month,\u00a0Haiti\u2019s gangs put their weapons to devastating use, taking the country hostage in an explosion of coordinated violence that forced then-Prime Minister Ariel Henry to resign, and led to the creation of a transitional governing council that has so far been mired in disagreement. \u201cThe planes have not stopped flying. There continue to be exchanges of both ammunition and arms across the border,\u201d Sylvie Bertrand, the UNODC regional representative, told CNN recently, urging the global community to enforce the arms embargo. But amid today\u2019s chaos, experts say it is likely becoming easier than ever for the gangs to resupply, as they now control major routes and infrastructure to bypass official controls. \u201cThere are always weapons coming in. There are always bullets,\u201d Vitel\u2019homme Innocent, leader of the Kraze Bary\u00e9 gang, told CNN in April, his masked entourage bristling with a globally manufactured assortment of firepower. Weapons experts who later analyzed some of CNN\u2019s images from the encounter said they could spot weapons and accessory parts originating from Israel, Turkey, the Czech Republic, probably Brazil \u2013 and, overwhelmingly, from the United States. An \u2018iron river\u2019 from the United States The guns\u00a0Haiti\u2019s gangs wield are a mix of stolen and smuggled, and the United States is by far the main source of the latter, according to UN experts. From 2020 to 2022, over 80% of the weapons seized in\u00a0Haiti\u00a0and submitted to US authorities for tracing were manufactured in or imported from the United States,\u00a0UNODC\u00a0reported in January,\u00a0citing the most-recent available tracing data. \u00a0They are typically purchased in the US from federally licensed retail outlets, gun shows or pawn shops through \u201cstraw man\u201d intermediaries, the agency also found. It\u2019s all part of a phenomenon that experts in Latin America and the Caribbean call the \u201ciron river\u201d \u2013 a flood of guns bought in US states with lax gun laws, and then shipped across the region to criminal groups. The Mexican government, which has been outspoken about the issue, currently has a $10 billion lawsuit pending against several US gun manufacturers whose products, it says, arm powerful cartels. A senior agent at the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), which investigates the diversion of lawfully purchased guns to illegal ends, told CNN that Miami is a significant source of weapons sent to\u00a0Haiti, which have historically been trafficked in small freighters by family networks. \u201cThose are difficult to enforce because they\u2019re not your typical commercial freighter\u2026 it\u2019s relatively easy to conceal a small number of firearms in those shipments,\u201d he said. Texas, Louisiana, and Georgia are also sources of weapons trafficked to the Caribbean, where the ATF has a specialized gun intelligence unit to track and stop such flows, he added. Asked whether the US was doing enough, he emphasized that combatting gun trafficking was a top priority. \u201cIt is a very high priority of the United States government and ATF\u2019s role in that, to stem the flow of illegal firearms, whether domestic or international, and particularly places like\u00a0Haiti\u00a0where the rule of law is under extreme threat.\u201d In January, Joly Germine \u2013 leader of the gang 400 Mawozo \u2013 pleaded guilty to\u00a0US charges over a gunrunning scheme\u00a0that saw dozens of rifles, handguns and a shotgun purchased legally in Florida under false pretenses, and smuggled into\u00a0Haiti. Land of mountains From above, traces of Haiti\u2019s extensive smuggling networks come into focus: the scars of a clandestine airstrip in its sun-bleached Central Plateau, a dock jutting from gang-held territory into the still waters of the Gulf of Gonave. Sea and air are the main means of transport for the guns and the drugs trans-shipments that fund more weapons purchases, experts say. And while\u00a0Haitian authorities have seen some successes in seizing illicit cargo over the years, the dramatic peaks and plains of this \u201cland of mountains\u201d add difficulty for an already understaffed police force and customs agency. Haiti\u2019s secluded and sparsely populated rural areas are ideal for landings and take-offs by small planes aiming to avoid observation. There are at least 11 known informal or clandestine airstrips in the country, according to UNODC, many originally built for humanitarian purposes following the country\u2019s devastating 2010 earthquake. \u201cHere, you don\u2019t have anything around you. So, you just go, probably in the middle of the night, with a couple vehicles parked on each side of the improvised runway so the pilot can identify the area. They land, drop off or pick up stuff, and take off again all outside of\u00a0Haitian jurisdiction,\u201d a\u00a0security expert in Port-au-Prince told CNN. The sea is the preferred option for arms smugglers given the weight of their cargo.\u00a0Haiti\u2019s roughly horseshoe shape offers\u00a0over 1,100 miles of coastline, a challenging distance to comprehensively patrol for\u00a0Haiti\u2019s coast guard. Haiti\u2019s south in particular has emerged as a strategic location for smugglers, the UNODC reported in April, offering entry points for cocaine from South America, cannabis from Jamaica and firearms from across the region. \u201cOne popular method of moving illegal products involves \u201cbanana boats,\u201d go-fast vessels that arrive at night, beach on coastal banana plantations, and are subsequently destroyed after unloading their cargo,\u201d the UNODC report details. Guns and ammunition that arrive in the south are frequently sent onward to Port-au-Prince via the gang-controlled Route National 3, it also said, identifying the Mariani gang, Grand Ravine gang, and 5 Segond gang as \u201cmajor players in the organization and distribution of arms, munitions and drugs.\u201d In 2022, 5 Segond group attacked\u00a0Haiti\u2019s largest flour mill. It would have been an incongruous target if not for its location, positioned right next to Port-au-Prince Bay with a large jetty to accept deliveries. Just about a mile inland lies a major highway, and in between the two is a massive warehouse; a perfect distribution set-up for any import entrepreneur. Today, the entire area is controlled by 5 Segond, with security sources telling CNN that they believe the mill has been taken over and no longer functions. \u201cIzo has the jetty, so he has access to the sea. And boats keep coming in and out of that area, which again is completely controlled by his gang\u2026 and is kept under tight control, with barricades in the surroundings,\u201d the same security expert said, referring to 5 Segond\u2019s rapper frontman\u00a0Andre Johnson, who often posts videos of gang members flashing guns and paramilitary gear set to music on social media. Containers and corruption Contraband arriving via secretive small boats and planes is just part of the picture. Last month,\u00a0Haitian National Police and Customs agents seized\u00a0more than two dozen firearms, including 12 assault rifles, and nearly a thousand cartridges\u00a0from a shipping container that had arrived\u00a0in Haiti\u2019s northern city of Cap\u00a0Haitien. Drugs and arms smuggling has a long history in\u00a0Haiti, much of it facilitated through official channels by government agents and even, in one 2022 case, by a rogue Episcopal church staffer who allegedly hid guns and thousands of rounds in a shipping container reportedly labeled as church donations, before it was seized by customs agents in Port-au-Prince. Customs officials\u00a0trying to do their job\u00a0on the front lines in\u00a0Haiti\u00a0can face threats to their lives. In 2018, local press reported that several customs agents at the Malpasse border crossing between the Dominican Republic and\u00a0Haiti\u00a0were burned alive after an argument erupted in the course of a cargo inspection. Allegations of smuggling and gang affiliations have also been made at the highest levels of\u00a0Haiti\u2019s government. Four former\u00a0Haitian senators\u00a0have been sanctioned by the US for alleged drug trafficking, as have multiple past presidents and prime ministers of\u00a0Haiti\u00a0for allegedly financing the country\u2019s gangs. They\u2019re part of what gang leader Innocent refers to as the country\u2019s \u201coligarchs,\u201d who historically created and armed local gangs to become their enforcers-for-hire as they profited from white-collar crime schemes. \u201cAs a\u00a0Haitian human rights defender, I can\u2019t say that all the responsibility for these guns is on the US \u2013 I think it\u2019s the\u00a0Haitian government too. They need to regain control of the port, they need to control customs. The problem is corruption,\u201d says Esperance, the human rights advocate. That\u2019s why, he says, the planned deployment of an international police force to restore calm to\u00a0Haiti\u00a0is destined to fail unless the US and global community also commit to fighting corruption, building frameworks for good governance, and closing legal loopholes abused by the country\u2019s elite. \u201cNow, of course, the government is completely destabilized, it\u2019s easy for the gangs to smuggle weapons themselves. But how did they begin? Just two years ago, smuggling was going through official channels, and it happened that way because everyone was corrupt,\u201d Esperance said. Bertrand, the UNODC representative, also emphasized the importance of building up\u00a0Haiti\u2019s institutions as its new government takes shape. Her agency is working to strengthen the country\u2019s customs authority and coast guard, for example, including providing much-needed equipment from protective gear to cargo scanners. \u201cIt\u2019s time for people in\u00a0Haiti\u00a0to live peacefully \u2013 for their kids to go back to school, for them to be able to eat every day.\u201d And that means, she says, ensuring that \u201cnational authorities are well-trained, well-equipped, and ready to face and curb down the level of violence.\u201d CNN reached out to Homeland Security Investigations, part of the US Department of Homeland Security; the US Department of Commerce\u2019s Office of Export Enforcement, Haiti\u2019s National Police and Haiti\u2019s General Customs Administration for comment.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/americas/haiti-mss-unodc-guns-drugs-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_uk_uk-sex-education-gender-schools-rishi-sunak-gbr-intl", "text": "As a general election inches closer into view, the embittered debates circulating inside British politics have entered a new arena: the classroom. New guidance unveiled by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak\u2019s government on Thursday seeks to overhaul the way sex education and gender identity is taught in England\u2019s schools, a significant intervention into a delicate topic that appeared suddenly on the front pages of Britain\u2019s newspapers a day before the announcement. The government says the revised guidance, which came amid pressure from a handful of its lawmakers, provides clarity on a complex topic, emphasizing facts over what it calls \u201ccontested views\u201d about gender identity. But critics of the plans \u2013 among them a swath of teachers and teaching union leaders \u2013 say the move is a politicized attempt to appeal to a narrow cohort of voters the government is in danger of losing, months before a general election. And they arrived amid what most see as the death throes of Sunak\u2019s flailing government, which has for months seized upon and discarded a number of divisive topics in the hopes of reversing a stubborn polling deficit. Pepe Di\u2019lasio, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders and a headteacher at a school in northern England, told CNN the plans were, in his view, driven by \u201ca political agenda at the front of a campaign season.\u201d \u201cWhen the first time you hear about those is in a headline on a tabloid newspaper, then that doesn\u2019t reassure you that the right research is taking place, and that the right level of integrity is behind the decision-making,\u201d Di\u2019lasio said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is young people, and their health and wellbeing, and their care and guidance, being used as a political football.\u201d \u2018Utterly disgraceful\u2019 The new draft guidance from the government, published Thursday, takes aim at the way sex and relationships are taught to English children in both primary and secondary schools. Those lessons have been compulsory at schools in England since 2020, but the government says it reviewed how they are taught after \u201creports of pupils being taught inappropriate content\u201d in some schools. Under the new approach, children can\u2019t be taught sex education before the age of nine, while \u201cexplicit discussion of sexual activity\u201d will be delayed until children are 13. Gender identity, or the fact that people can change gender, is meanwhile \u201chighly contested and should not be taught\u201d at all, according to the Department of Education. The government said that teaching what it calls the \u201ctheory\u201d of gender identity \u201ccould prompt some children to start to question their gender when they may not have done so otherwise\u201d \u2013 a suggestion that has been angrily contested by LGBTQ+ rights groups. \u201cIt is hard to see how rigid limits on what can be discussed and when would be in the best interests of young people \u2013 and this may even risk them seeking information from less reliable sources,\u201d Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said in a statement. Referring to the parts of the guidance that target the teaching of transgender issues, Di\u2019lasio told CNN that teachers should be allowed to discuss societal issues of the day with students, rather than have those conversations restricted. Sam Freedman, a senior adviser to the Ark education charity and a senior fellow at the Institute for Government think tank, added on X: \u201cIsn\u2019t something being highly contested a good reason to talk about it in schools - acknowledging that it is highly contested and explaining why?\u201d The plans will be subject to a nine-week consultation period, which will conclude before the start of Britain\u2019s next school year. But the uncertain timing of a general election \u2013 due by January, and expected in the second half of the year \u2013 muddies the waters further as to when, or if, the guidance will ever be implemented. And, as with many of the government\u2019s recent announcements, its unveiling was accompanied by a string of combative language that played into the \u201cculture war\u201d topics the Conservatives have increasingly sought to thrust into the national discourse. Education Secretary Gillian Keegan wrote in The Sun newspaper that \u201cteachers are there to teach children facts, not push the agendas of \u00adcampaign groups.\u201d \u201cNever again will young girls be taught they might be that \u00adlittle bit happier if they were a boy,\u201d she added. Transgender rights have been the target of heavy-handed rhetoric from the government for several months, as Sunak looks to goad his opponent, Labour leader Keir Starmer, away from debates about the economy and healthcare, and toward issues surrounding identity. Those efforts ultimately sparked huge controversy when Sunak made a transgender jibe toward Starmer in Parliament in February, while the mother of Brianna Ghey, a 16-year-old transgender girl who was murdered last year, watched from the public gallery. \u201cOne does wonder whether (the guidance) is connected to the fact that we\u2019re moving into a general election, and it is purely being used to gain votes of a particular section of society,\u201d Di\u2019lasio said. \u201cIt is utterly disgraceful that once again this government has decided to engage in private briefings and media leaks simply to grab headlines,\u201d Whiteman, the head teachers\u2019 union boss, added. \u201cThe children and young people of this country deserve better.\u201d Asked by the BBC on Thursday how widespread \u201cinappropriate\u201d teaching on gender identity was, Keegan admitted: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s widespread \u2013 I mean, I don\u2019t know, because it\u2019s not something that we\u2019ve gone and done a particular survey of.\u201d Sunak will hope this week\u2019s headlines can add ammunition to his effort to portray himself as a defender of \u201ccommon sense,\u201d a catch-all term that the prime minister frequently uses as he scrambles to maintain the support of socially conservative voters. But education specialists worry that school pupils have become the latest victim of that push. Di\u2019lasio told CNN that the guidance marked a departure from the way new instructions have historically been passed down to schools. \u201cYou may not have agreed with all of them over time, but there was always some evidence behind them. There was always some research behind them,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when a political ideology comes into it, it becomes more difficult for the whole of the education world to move behind it,\u201d he added. \u201cMy worry is that if we\u2019re not careful, there will be young people that are not cared for and not educated in the way we want them to be.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/uk/uk-sex-education-gender-schools-rishi-sunak-gbr-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "world"}}

Straphangers at bus stops clutch steaming coffees and huddle for warmth. On the horizon, views of the Andes are as spectacular as ever, their snow-capped peaks gleaming extra bright after an early-season storm. Santiago is under a record freeze. After an eight-day \u201ccold wave\u201d pushed through the capital region this week, the average temperature for May dropped to 37 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) \u2013 the coldest since 1950, according to Ang\u00e9lica Guz\u00e1man, a meteorologist with the Chilean Meteorologic Directorate.

{"id": "2024_05_16_middleeast_egypt-pyramids-nile-river-lost-ahramat-branch-scn", "text": "Egypt\u2019s Great Pyramid and other ancient monuments at Giza exist on an isolated strip of land at the edge of the Sahara Desert. The inhospitable location has long puzzled archaeologists, some of whom had found evidence that the Nile River once flowed near these pyramids in some capacity, facilitating the landmarks\u2019 construction starting 4,700 years ago. Using satellite imaging and analysis of cores of sediment, a new study published Thursday in the journal Communications Earth & Environment has mapped a 64-kilometer (40-mile) long, dried-up, branch of the Nile, long buried beneath farmland and desert. \u201cEven though many efforts to reconstruct the early Nile waterways have been conducted, they have largely been confined to soil sample collections from small sites, which has led to the mapping of only fragmented sections of the ancient Nile channel systems,\u201d said lead study author Eman Ghoneim, a professor and director of the Space and Drone Remote Sensing Lab at the University of North Carolina Wilmington\u2019s department of Earth and ocean sciences. \u201cThis is the first study to provide the first map of the long-lost ancient branch of the Nile River.\u201d Ghoneim and her colleagues refer to this extinct branch of the Nile river as Ahramat, which is Arabic for pyramids. The ancient waterway would have been about 0.5 kilometers wide (about one-third of a mile) with a depth of at least 25 meters (82 feet) \u2014 similar to the contemporary Nile, Ghoneim said. \u201cThe large size and extended length of the Ahramat Branch and its proximity to the 31 pyramids in the study area strongly suggests a functional waterway of great importance,\u201d Ghoneim said. She said the river would have played a key role in ancient Egyptians\u2019 transportation of the enormous amount of building materials and laborers needed for the pyramids\u2019 construction. \u201cAlso, our research shows that many of the pyramids in the study area have (a) causeway, a ceremonial raised walkway, that runs perpendicular to the course of the Ahramat Branch and terminates directly on its riverbank.\u201d Hidden traces of a lost waterway Traces of the river aren\u2019t visible in aerial photos or in imagery from optical satellites, Ghoneim said. In fact, she only spotted something unexpected while studying radar satellite data of the wider area for ancient rivers and lakes that might reveal a new source of groundwater. \u201cI am a geomorphologist, a paleohydrologist\u00a0looking into landforms. I have this kind of trained eye,\u201d she said. \u201cWhile working with this data, I noticed this really obvious branch or a kind of riverbank, and it didn\u2019t make any sense because it is really far from the Nile,\u201d she added. Born and raised in Egypt, Ghoneim was familiar with the cluster of pyramids in this area and had always wondered why they were built there. She applied to the National Science Foundation to investigate further, and geophysical data taken at ground level with the use of ground-penetrating radar and electromagnetic tomography confirmed it was an ancient arm of the Nile. Two long cores of earth the team extracted using drilling equipment revealed sandy sediment consistent with a river channel at a depth of about 25 meters (82 feet). It\u2019s possible that \u201ccountless\u201d temples might still be buried beneath the agricultural fields and desert sands along the riverbank of the Ahramat Branch, according to the study. Why this branch of the river dried up or disappeared is still unclear. Most likely, a period of drought and desertification swept sand into the region, silting up the river, Ghoneim said. The study demonstrated that when the pyramids were built, the geography and riverscapes of the Nile differed significantly from those of today, said Nick Marriner, a geographer at the French National Centre for Scientific Research in Paris. He was not involved in the study but has conducted research on the fluvial history of Giza. \u201cThe study completes an important part of the past landscape puzzle,\u201d Marriner said. \u201cBy putting together these pieces we can gain a clearer picture of what the Nile floodplain looked like at the time of the pyramid builders and how the ancient Egyptians harnessed their environments to transport building materials for their monumental construction endeavors.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/middleeast/egypt-pyramids-nile-river-lost-ahramat-branch-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_17_china_xi-putin-china-visit-takeaways-intl-hnk", "text": "Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin\u2019s meeting in Beijing on Thursday left no question of how closely the Chinese and Russian leaders are aligned in their vision for the world \u2013 and on bolstering the \u201cpowerful driving force\u201d of their autocratic double act. The two vowed to deepen their strategic partnership, and took aim at a United States they painted as a destabilizing aggressor. In\u00a0a sweeping 7,000-word joint statement outlining their shared view on issues from Taiwan to the war in Gaza, they proclaimed: \u201cRussian-Chinese relations stand the test of rapid changes in the world, demonstrating strength and stability, and are experiencing the best period in their history.\u201d The meeting made for a deeply incongruous split-screen. As Xi and Putin sipped tea from wicker chairs in manicured gardens of the official Zhongnanhai compound and discussed how to \u201cpromote world peace and common development,\u201d Ukrainian civilians called for evacuation from villages under assault from Russian forces. Putin\u2019s two-day state visit comes as Western leaders have leant on Xi to ensure that soaring exports from his country aren\u2019t propping up the Russian war effort \u2013 a claim Beijing denies. But even as Putin\u2019s pomp-filled welcome in the Chinese capital seemed to fly in the face of Western concerns about the partnership, Putin appeared to depart Beijing with few,\u00a0publicly acknowledged\u00a0gains \u2014 though it remains unclear what happened in discussions behind closed doors. Here are three key takeaways from the meeting. Taking aim at a US-led world order Xi and Putin used their meetings and hefty statement to take aim at what they described as a global security system defined by US-backed military alliances \u2013 and pledged to work together to counter it. \u201c[We] intend to increase interaction and tighten coordination in order to counter Washington\u2019s destructive and hostile course towards the so-called \u2018dual containment\u2019 of our countries,\u201d the leaders pledged in their joint statement. The joint statement also called on the US not to arm its allies with missile systems, and condemned US cooperation with allies as \u201cextremely destabilizing.\u201d The US considers China the \u201cmost serious long-term challenge to the international order,\u201d and Russia \u201ca clear and present threat.\u201d The strident declaration comes as both Russia and China have criticized US support for Israel and its war against militant group Hamas and sought to bolster ties across the Global South, where there is mounting backlash against Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza. On that conflict, they called for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state, while also voicing their points of alignment on a range of other contentious geopolitical issues including Taiwan and North Korea. Growing military cooperation While slamming US military alliances, the two leaders pledged to \u201cdeepen\u201d military \u201ctrust and cooperation,\u201d saying they would expand joint exercises and combat training, regularly conduct joint sea and air patrols, and improve the \u201ccapabilities and level of joint response to challenges and threats.\u201d The two nations have grown their military drills around the world in recent years, continuing after Russia launched its war in Ukraine in February 2022 \u2013 drawing concern from Western observers that the two US rivals are working to enhance their military interoperability. Putin also traveled to Beijing with top security officials who the Russian president said Thursday would join informal talks on Ukraine. Newly appointed Russian Defense Minister Andrey Belousov, and his predecessor Russian Security Council Secretary Sergey Shoigu, both attended. It wasn\u2019t clear if Chinese defense officials joined those talks, which took place, according to Russia state media, during four-hour informal negotiations behind the gates of the heavily secured Zhongnanhai compound \u2014 the residence for the leadership of the\u00a0Chinese\u00a0Communist Party. The Chinese Foreign Ministry quoted Xi as reiterating a call for a \u201cpolitical solution\u201d in Ukraine, as well as his support for a peace conference recognized by both sides. Observers say Putin was likely interested in discussing material support for Russia\u2019s war or defense industry, including dual-use items the US has said China is exporting to Russia, which power its defense industrial base. Beijing, which says it is neutral on the war, has repeatedly\u00a0defended its trade\u00a0with Russia as part of normal bilateral relations. But such negotiations may show the limits of the partnership, at least when it comes to China increasing its support to include weapons. Xi, analysts say, is seeking to keep Putin as a close partner, while not stepping over Western red lines. \u201cPutin has gone to China in order to ask for more help from China, help he is unlikely to receive \u2026 he\u2019s not going to get weapons and ammunition and other types of direct support from China for Russia\u2019s war effort,\u201d former US ambassador to NATO Kurt Volker told CNN. Broad rhetoric, few concrete pledges Despite the lofty rhetoric, information on any major deals brokered during the meeting was scant as Putin departed Beijing for the second day of the visit in northeastern China\u2019s Harbin. One deal apparently left un-inked was on plans for a \u201cPower of Siberia 2\u201d pipeline, which would funnel Russian natural gas to China. Beijing is widely seen as hesitating on the long-hyped deal, which Putin wants to replace revenue lost as Europe reduces its reliance on Russian fuels after the Ukraine invasion. Instead, the leaders in broad strokes pledged to \u201cjointly promote the implementation of large-scale energy projects,\u201d while upping energy cooperation across oil, liquified natural gas, natural gas, coal and electricity. They also called for strengthening industrial cooperation across a range of fields including civil aviation construction, electronics, chemical industry, shipbuilding and industrial equipment. These pledges, however vague, do\u00a0signpost more economic coordination in the years to come. \u201cFor Putin, it\u2019s a glory moment that Russia is still on its feet (economically) \u2026 mostly because of the lifeline provided by China,\u201d said Alexandra Prokopenko, a fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center. For that reason, she added, \u201che\u2019s okay with on-going dependency between Russia and China \u2013 and with inequality in this relationship.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/china/xi-putin-china-visit-takeaways-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_asia_new-caledonia-violence-france-vote-intl-hnk", "text": "The French government has declared a state of emergency in its South Pacific island territory of New Caledonia after deadly violence erupted for a third day Wednesday, with armed clashes between protesters, militias and police, and buildings and cars set on fire in the capital. At least four people have died in the unrest, which is considered the worst since the 1980s. In the capital Noumea, authorities have imposed a curfew and closed the main airport \u2014 usually a busy tourist hub \u2014 to commercial traffic. They have also banned public gatherings, carrying weapons and selling alcohol. The violence is the latest outburst of political tensions that have simmered for years and pitted the island\u2019s largely pro-independence indigenous Kanak communities \u2014 who have long chafed against rule by Paris \u2013 against French inhabitants opposed to breaking ties with their motherland. Protests began Monday involving mostly young people, in response to the tabling of a vote 10,000 miles (17,000 kilometers) away in the French parliament proposing changes to New Caledonia\u2019s constitution that would give greater voting rights to French residents living on the islands. On Tuesday, legislators voted\u00a0overwhelmingly\u00a0in favor of the change. \u201cThe last two days we\u2019ve seen violence of a scale we haven\u2019t seen for 30 years in New Caledonia,\u201d Denise Fisher, a former\u00a0Australian Consul-General in New Caledonia, told CNN. \u201cIt is kind of marking the end of 30 years of peace.\u201d \u201cThe Kanak people are objecting to [the vote in France] not just because it\u2019s been decided in Paris without them but also they feel that they want it to be part of a negotiation \u2026 which would include another self determination vote and a range of other things.\u201d The proposed changes to the constitution would add thousands of extra voters to New Caledonia\u2019s electoral rolls, which have not been updated since the late 1990s. Pro-independence groups say the changes are an attempt by France to consolidate its rule over the archipelago. France\u2019s interior ministry told CNN that 1,800 police officers and gendarmes are already present in New Caledonia and 500 additional police will arrive in the coming hours. The state of emergency will allow authorities to impose restrictions on movement and carry out house arrests and searches. A spokesperson for the French government said the measures were needed to \u201cdeal with the serious breaches of public order which are occurring.\u201d Lying in the South Pacific with Australia, Fiji and Vanuatu for neighbors, New Caledonia is a semiautonomous French territory \u2014 one of a dozen scattered throughout the Pacific, Caribbean and Indian Ocean. French President Emmanuel Macron called for calm, issuing a letter Wednesday to New Caledonian political leaders urging them to \u201cunambiguously condemn all this violence\u201d and inviting both pro- and anti-independence leaders to meet him \u201cface to face\u201d in Paris. Macron\u2019s administration has pushed for a pivot to the Indo-Pacific, stressing that France is a Pacific power, as China and the United States beef up their presence amid a battle for influence in the strategically important region. New Caledonia is at the center of that plan. \u201cThe stakes are high for France,\u201d Fisher added. \u201cFrance has identified an entire Indo-Pacific vision for itself.\u201d \u201cThe legitimacy of France\u2019s participation this way, having an influence in this way, is in question when you have scenes like this.\u201d The violence Three people - two men and a woman, all indigenous Kanaks - have been shot dead in the violent protests and looting, according to Charles Wea, spokesperson for\u00a0Louis Mapou, President of the Government of New Caledonia. A French police officer who was injured by gunfire in the riots also died, French interior minister\u00a0G\u00e9rald Darmanin said. Demonstrators have also set fire to buildings and cars in Noumea, defying a curfew that has been extended to Thursday. Thick plumes of black smoke covered the capital on Wednesday morning, social media video showed. Images showed burned-out cars, fires in the street, and shops vandalized and looted. \u201cSome are equipped with hunting rifles with buckshot as ammunition. Others were equipped with larger rifles, firing bullets,\u201d the French High commissioner to New Caledonia Louis Le Franc said. More than 140 people have been arrested, while at least 60 security personnel have been injured in the clashes between local nationalist groups and the French authorities, according to Le Franc. One Noumea resident told CNN affiliate Radio New Zealand of panic buying reminiscent of Covid-19. \u201cA lot of fire, violence\u2026but it\u2019s better I stay safe at home. There are a lot of police and army. I want the government to put the action for the peace,\u201d the person told RNZ, asking to remain anonymous. The vote Colonial France took control of New Caledonia in 1853. White settlement followed and the indigenous Kanak people were longtime victims of harsh segregation policies. Many indigenous inhabitants continue to live with high rates of poverty and high unemployment to this day. Deadly violence exploded in the 1980s eventually paving the way towards the Noumea Accord in 1998, a promise by France to give greater political autonomy to the Kanak community. Multiple referendums were held in recent years - in 2018, 2020 and 2021 - as part of the agreement offering voters in New Caledonia the option to secede from France. Each referendum was voted down, but the process was marred by boycotts from pro-independence groups and by Covid-19. Voter roles have been frozen since the Noumea Accord, the issue that France\u2019s parliament was seeking to address in the vote that sparked this week\u2019s violence. French lawmakers in Paris voted 351 \u2013 153 in favor of changing the constitution to \u201cunfreeze\u201d the territory\u2019s electoral rolls, enfranchising French residents who have been in New Caledonia for 10 years. The lists were frozen by the French government to appease pro-independence Kanak nationalists who believe new arrivals to the former colony, including from France, dilute popular support for independence. Both houses of France\u2019s parliament need to approve the constitutional change passed by the National Assembly. On Tuesday, French Prime Minister Gabriel\u00a0Attal said the government would not call a meeting of the parliament to vote on the motion before talks with Kanak leaders, including major independence alliance the Kanak and Socialist National Liberation Front (FLNKS). \u201cI invite New Caledonia\u2019s political leaders to seize this opportunity and come to Paris for talks in the coming weeks. The important thing is conciliation. Dialogue is important. It is about finding a common, political and global solution,\u201d\u00a0Attal said on the floor of the National Assembly. FLNKS issued its own statement Wednesday both condemning the vote at the National Assembly and calling for an end to the violence. \u201cFLNKS appeals to the youth involved in these demonstrations for appeasement and to ensure the safety of the population and property,\u201d the statement read.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/asia/new-caledonia-violence-france-vote-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "world"}}

Dressed as a yellow water lily\u00a0she twirled, sashayed and even did the splits in front of outgoing president Tsai Ing-wen, all while lip-syncing to Lady Gaga\u2019s \u201cMarry the Night\u201d and Taiwanese singer Huang Fei\u2019s \u201cChase, Chase, Chase.\u201d \u201cThis is probably the first presidential office in the world to host a drag show,\u201d Nymphia told Tsai after her performance and thanked Tsai for her service. \u201cThank you for your contributions to this country, so that I could grow up to be like this today,\u201d Nymphia added with tears in her eyes. \u201cThank you for your eight years of dedication, becoming our Taiwan mother.\u201d Taiwan is a vibrant democracy of 24 million people that Beijing\u2019s ruling Communist Party claims as its territory \u2013 despite never having controlled it. But it is not recognized as an independent country by most governments in the world and has lost a string of diplomatic allies to Beijing in recent years. Tsai and her ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) have championed LGBTQ+ rights, making it a more liberal bastion in conservative Asia.\u00a0The self-ruled island is one of the most progressive societies for sexual minorities.\u00a0In a first for the region, Taiwan legalized same-sex marriage in 2019.\u00a0Across the strait, China has been fast moving the opposite direction under Chinese leader Xi Jinping,\u00a0with crackdowns\u00a0on LGBTQ groups and content. Taipei, Taiwan\u2019s capital, hosts East Asia\u2019s largest Pride march every October. Last year, Vice President Lai Ching-te, who will take office on Monday as Taiwan\u2019s next president, became the most senior government leader ever to attend the celebration. Reactions to the spectacle on social media were largely positive. \u201cThank you for allowing us to be at the forefront so that we can proudly show the world how free we are,\u201d said one\u00a0user commenting on Nymphia\u2019s performance on Tsai\u2019s official Facebook account, which concluded with her singing to popstar Jolin Tsai\u2019s gender equality hit \u201cWomxnly\u201d and joined by five of her fellow drag queens. \u201cI wanted to cry at the end; Taiwan has come such a long way from a time where we were called feminine, to having same sex marriage legalized and drag queens performing at the presidential palace today,\u201d wrote another. Not everyone was fan. One user wrote, \u201cI don\u2019t know what drag queens are, but I don\u2019t want my kids to be like this.\u201d While on China\u2019s Weibo, some took issue of the performance taking place in front of the bust of Sun Yat Sen, who is often called the father of modern China and whose legacy is claimed by the governments of both China and Taiwan. Nymphia, the alter-ego of Taiwanese American dressmaker Leo Tsao, was the first East Asian to win \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race,\u201d and she made it a point during her time on the show to raise awareness and appreciation of her cultural background. On the show\u2019s finale she wore a dramatic outfit inspired by bubble tea, one of Taiwan\u2019s biggest cultural exports, and many of her outfits referenced Asian heritage. Nymphia is a well-established artist on Taiwan\u2019s thriving drag scene, known for over-the-top outfits that she creates herself. She has performed in Taiwanese temples and undertook a photoshoot at wet markets dressed as bananas in various stages of ripeness. The tropical fruit is a common motif in Nymphia\u2019s creations that\u2019s become a trademark of sorts. It\u2019s a cheeky reclamation of the sometimes derogatory term used to describe Asians growing up in the West, being yellow on the outside but white on the inside. As she accepted her crown and sceptre on \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\u201d she said: \u201cTo those who feel like they don\u2019t belong, just remember to live fearlessly and have courage to live your truth \u2013 and Taiwan this is for you!\u201d Tsai told Nymphia after her performance: \u201cI want to thank you for demonstrating your fearless beauty, standing up and breaking down barriers,\u201d adding that her story \u201cwill bring courage to many young people in Taiwan, so they stay fearless and stay true to their hearts.\u201d Additional reporting by Reuters.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/style/drag-queen-nymphia-wind-taiwan-president-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_18_world_dinosaurs-warm-blooded-science-newsletter-wt-scn", "text": "Dinosaur means \u201cterrible lizard.\u201d The idea that the prehistoric creatures were scaly, sluggish reptiles with sprawling postures that dragged their tails through tropical swamps is deeply imprinted in the collective imagination. However, science now has a more nuanced understanding of the diversity of dinosaur physiology. Many dinosaurs sported brightly colored feathers like birds. Dinos lived in many different ecosystems, including the Arctic, where they would have encountered snow (if not the ice caps of today) and winters devoid of light. New research this week is adding fresh detail to one of paleontology\u2019s biggest questions: Did dinosaur blood run hot or cold? Dino-mite It\u2019s hard to find evidence that unquestionably shows what dinosaur metabolisms were like. Clues from fossilized eggshells and bones have now suggested that some dinosaurs were warm-blooded and others were not. Gleaning the answer matters because it sheds light on dinosaur behavior. Warm-blooded animals, such as mammals and birds, are more active than their cold-blooded counterparts. A new study, based on fossils from 1,000 dinosaur species and paleoclimate information, found that the three main dinosaur groups adapted differently, with two of the groups evolving\u00a0the ability to regulate body temperature\u00a0in the early Jurassic Period about 180 million years ago. The research suggested that meat-eating theropods, which included T. rex, and plant-eating ornithischians, such as Triceratops and Stegosaurus, spread to live in colder climates during the early Jurassic Period, indicating that they may have evolved the ability to generate body heat internally. A long time ago Researchers have mapped a 40-mile-long extinct section of the Nile River through satellite radar imaging and analysis of sediment. Ancient Egyptians erected some 31 pyramids, including Giza\u2019s Great Pyramid, along the banks of the now-defunct arm of the river, which the builders likely used to transport stone and other construction materials. The discovery, buried deep beneath farmland and not visible in aerial photographs, may help archaeologists locate other Egyptian temples and monuments concealed by fields and desert sands that now cover the riverbed. Trailblazers In another feat of mapping, a 3D model of a cubic millimeter of brain tissue \u2014 smaller than a grain of rice \u2014 is now available in staggering detail and beauty, thanks to a collaboration between Harvard University and Google researchers. A team led by Dr. Jeff Lichtman, a professor of molecular and cellular biology at Harvard, cut the sample into thin sections one-thousandth the thickness of a human hair. Despite the fragment\u2019s tiny size, it contained 57,000 cells, 230 millimeters of blood vessels and 150 million synapses. The colorized images make the individual components more visible, but they are otherwise a truthful representation of the tissue. Eventually, the team hopes that observing the brain in this way could help scientists make sense of unresolved medical conditions such as autism. Climate changed The patterns of rings in tree trunks \u2014 affected by sunlight, rainfall and temperature \u2014 provide a climate history for each year of their lives, going back hundreds or even thousands of years. Tree-ring data from nine regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including North America and Scandinavia, have allowed scientists to reconstruct annual temperatures for Northern Hemisphere summers between the years 1 and 1849 and compare them with last summer\u2019s temperatures. The summer of 2023 was warmer than any other summer during this 2,000-year period, according to the study. The temperature then was at least 0.5 degree Celsius (0.9 degree Fahrenheit) warmer than the warmest summer during the period studied, the year 246 \u2014 when the Roman Empire still ruled over Europe and the Maya civilization dominated Central America. Fantastic creatures Marine scientists have used artificial intelligence to decode previously unknown complexity in the calls of sperm whales. The whales produced a catalog of clicking sounds, which the researchers described as akin to a \u201cphonetic alphabet\u201d for sperm whales. Sperm whales produce clicks by forcing air through an organ in their heads called the spermaceti, and these sounds can be as loud as 230 decibels \u2014 louder than a rocket launch and capable of rupturing human eardrums. What sperm whales are saying with their clicks remains a mystery to human ears, but understanding the scope of their vocal exchanges is an important step toward linking their calls with specific behavior.

He was responding to a question from CNN\u2019s Jim Sciutto about whether he holds the US responsible for the delay in aid which Russian forces have been able to take advantage of and advance further into Ukraine. Kuleba\u2019s comments come after Moscow has ramped up its offensive in northern Ukraine. Last week it\u00a0launched its most surprising operation\u00a0in two years of war, crossing the northern border in renewed attempts to take Kharkiv, the country\u2019s second most populous city. Vovchansk, in the northern Kharkiv region, has faced an onslaught, with Russian forces claiming to control surrounding villages, forcing civilians to flee. Analysts say Russia was prepared for the hiatus in Western military aid to Ukraine and has exploited it for its own gain. \u201cUkraine may need to make difficult decisions due to slowness of US action and the dilemma that is now causing,\u201d George Barros at the Institute for the Study of War in Washington previously told CNN. It comes as Kyiv\u2019s forces are thinly stretched, with much less artillery than the Russians, inadequate air defenses and a lack of soldiers. Kuleba described Ukraine\u2019s current position on the frontline as \u201ctough.\u201d \u201cRussia is strong, we are suffering from\u2026 insufficient supplies of military assistance which we are forced to compensate with heroism and sacrifice of our soldiers,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the main message remains the same: send us everything. Because we have proven over these two years that when our soldiers have everything they need, we succeed, and when we don\u2019t have everything that we need, we don\u2019t,\u201d he added. The foreign minister went on to say the situation on the battlefield would be different if countries did more to assist Ukraine, claiming that if every country were to follow Estonia\u2019s footsteps in allocating 1% of GDP to military aid for Ukraine they would be able to perform better on the battlefield. \u201cEstonia is a country that proves to the whole world that a small country with a big heart can make a big difference and it\u2019s a paradigm for everyone to follow,\u201d he said.

Instead, she\u2019s spending her days and nights at\u00a0Gaza\u2019s\u00a0European Hospital\u00a0on the outskirts of Rafah. Kattan, an anesthesiologist and specialist in critical care, is one of at least 22\u00a0American physicians trapped in Gaza after an Israeli military offensive in Rafah last week shuttered the city\u2019s critical border crossing to Egypt. Rafah had, until then,\u00a0served as the only entry and exit point for foreign aid workers into and out of Gaza. \u201cMy kids have already been texting me today saying, you said Tuesday that you were going to be home,\u201d\u00a0Kattan told CNN. \u201cThe\u00a0WHO\u00a0(World Health Organization) is trying to negotiate a safe exit for us. And it\u2019s not happening.\u201d The crossing has been closed since the Israeli military seized it early last week. Israeli and Egyptian officials have so far failed to reach an agreement on reopening it, instead trading blame for its continued closure. Meanwhile, dozens of foreign doctors are stuck in Gaza, while others are unable to get in as humanitarian conditions worsen inside the besieged enclave. FAJR Scientific, the\u00a0United States-based\u00a0nonprofit organization that brought\u00a0Kattan and 16 other physicians to Gaza, is now calling on the US government to help coordinate the team\u2019s safe exit from Gaza.\u00a0They had been due to leave on Monday. \u201cI am asking the\u00a0US government to step in and coordinate with the WHO to protect US citizens trapped in a war zone and bring them home ASAP,\u201d said Mosab Nasser, the organization\u2019s\u00a0chief executive, who is also in Gaza. At least one member of the team requires evacuation on medical grounds, he added. The 17 medics include 12 American citizens, three UK citizens, one Omani and one Egyptian. Kattan and her husband, who is also an anesthesiologist, arrived in Gaza more than two weeks ago, driven by the helplessness they felt watching the suffering in Gaza on\u00a0television\u00a0and knowing they could help. \u201cWe knew that anesthesiologists were needed for the civilians here, the women and the children. And we knew we had something we could offer,\u201d\u00a0said Kattan. \u2018This is what clean looks like in Gaza\u2019 The FAJR Scientific team recorded video diaries of their experiences\u00a0and the conditions they face\u00a0inside the European Hospital exclusively for CNN. In one video, Laura Swoboda, a nurse practitioner and wound specialist from Wisconsin,\u00a0describes\u00a0the buzz of drones overhead. \u201cEven in moments where we feel safe, the war is going on, and there\u2019s the potential for violence to resume,\u201d\u00a0she says. The dangerous conditions aren\u2019t only\u00a0to be found\u00a0outside the hospital. \u201cWe were not aware of how dire the situation is here. There wasn\u2019t soap to wash our hands between infected wounds with maggots. There wasn\u2019t\u00a0sanitizer wipes to wipe down the tables after each patient,\u201d Swoboda told CNN\u00a0in a Zoom interview. \u201cPeople were just coming in, person after person after person. We\u2019re out of gauze to clean the wounds. We\u2019re out of advanced dressings, we went through all of our cleansers, we\u2019re using whatever we can get our hands on at this point.\u201d \u201cThis is what clean looks like in Gaza,\u201d says\u00a0Kattan in\u00a0a\u00a0clip showing the state of an operating room, with plastic overalls strewn atop the operating table. Ahead of an operation to revise the amputations of a quadruple-amputee,\u00a0Kattan details the lack of anesthetics.

No way out FAJR\u00a0Scientific operates under the umbrella\u00a0of WHO which, according to\u00a0FAJR\u00a0Scientific, has been attempting to coordinate an evacuation. At least one other international medical mission is currently at the European\u00a0Hospital, organized by the Palestine American Medical Association. Of the 19 members on the PAMA medical team, 10 are US citizens. The volunteers on the\u00a0FAJR\u00a0Scientific\u00a0mission all knew the risks involved in traveling to a war zone,\u00a0said Kattan,\u00a0but getting stuck in Gaza was not a scenario they had contemplated. Now, she is torn between the desire to get back home to her\u00a0children\u00a0and the guilt she feels\u00a0for\u00a0trying to leave Gaza at a time when the Israeli military could widen its offensive and the need for medical personnel is\u00a0expected\u00a0to rise. \u201cIt\u2019s just missing my kids and waking up in the morning and realizing they\u2019re not next to me. But the harder part is knowing that I get to leave eventually. And I get to go home and be safe. And I know that my kids are safe,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve developed a lot of friends here who are the same age as me and have kids my age and they don\u2019t have those securities and those basic necessities.\u201d After\u00a0more than two weeks of\u00a0witnessing the enormous strain on one of\u00a0the last hospitals still in operation in southern Gaza,\u00a0Kattan\u00a0added that\u00a0she and her colleagues only want to leave Gaza\u00a0if they can be replaced by other physicians. \u201cWe are mothers and fathers who want to be home with their families, and sons and daughters, we are physicians here, and we have colleagues and we can\u2019t abandon them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/middleeast/american-medics-trapped-in-gaza-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "world_middleeast_dubai-worlds-biggest-waste-to-energy-facility", "text": "It\u2019s difficult to imagine that an empty cereal box, a banana peel, or a deflated football could contribute to powering your home. Yet in Dubai, nearly half of all discarded waste plays a role in household energy. Much of it ends up at a plant operated by the Warsan Waste Management Company. \u201cAround 45% percent of Dubai\u2019s total waste comes to this facility,\u201d says Tim Clarke, the company\u2019s CEO. Operational since March of this year, the Warsan plant will use 2 million metric tons of trash annually to produce electricity, enough to power approximately 135,000 homes, according to the company. It\u2019s known as a waste-to-energy plant, and about 13% of all urban waste worldwide ends up in a facility of this kind, according to the United Nations Environment Programme. This method of processing trash is widely adopted across Europe and in nations such as Japan, China, and the US. Yet the plant in Dubai distinguishes itself through its scale. \u201cIt\u2019s the largest facility of its kind in the world,\u201d says Clarke. \u201cWe operate at around 34% efficiency of producing electricity, which is much higher than would normally be expected from an energy waste plant, and that\u2019s partly because with this size we can operate at higher temperatures and higher pressures.\u201d The power of waste The process of converting waste into energy involves three steps: burning trash, using the heat to create steam, and directing the steam to drive a turbine, which generates electricity. The process has been used for more than 100 years, but modern facilities have far more control over the pollutants released as waste is incinerated. Flue gas treatment allows the plant to filter toxic substances and stop them from going into the air. \u201cWe inject reagents into [a reactor] to strip out all the harmful elements such as heavy metals, sulfur components, and they trap particles which are then taken away for disposal,\u201d explains the CEO. Not all pollutants are filtered out. Climate-warming carbon dioxide, for example, is released into the air. However, since the plant produces power, replacing the burning of fossil fuels, Warsan Waste Management believes the overall result is positive. \u201cWe emit CO2, but also we generate 200 megawatts of electricity that\u2019s not having to be produced by a fossil fuel source, which is primarily gas in the UAE,\u201d says Clarke. \u201cSo [we\u2019re] saving around 1.5 billion tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year.\u201d Facilities such as the one in Dubai also implement a few extra steps to maximize resource extraction. Metals, for instance, are separated for recycling. The mountains of ash, resulting from burning the trash, are collected and repurposed in road construction. According to Clarke, out of the 5,500 tons of waste that the facility receives per day, only 200 tons of residue that can\u2019t be reused remain after processing. Need for recycling Waste-to-Energy plants serve as an alternative to landfills, which contribute to approximately 11% of global methane emissions. \u201cIf we\u2019re globally putting more waste into open dumps, we\u2019re creating methane that is unmanaged. That methane then is creating a significant emissions challenge,\u201d explains Bryan Staley, CEO of the US-based non-profit Environmental Research and Education Foundation. \u201cAs a solution, waste-to-energy can create less emissions compared to a landfill setting,\u201d he adds. But some environmental groups, such as Zero Waste Europe, argue that burning waste to generate electricity discourages efforts to cut waste and initiatives to increase recycling. According to a document released by the government last year, the UAE recycles 20% of its treated waste, but hopes to increase that to 90% by 2050. Staley reinforces the need for recycling, as the most energy-efficient and environmentally friendly solution for waste management. \u201cThere can be this perception of, well, I\u2019ll just throw it in the trash can and it\u2019ll be taken care of,\u201d says Staley. \u201cBut your paper, your plastics, have a much better endpoint if they\u2019re recycled and recovered rather than going to a waste energy facility because you can turn those materials into products.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/world/middleeast/dubai-worlds-biggest-waste-to-energy-facility/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_17_sport_scottie-scheffler-detained", "text": "The world\u2019s top-ranked golfer, Scottie Scheffler, was arrested, charged with felony assault and released from jail before shooting a stellar 5-under par at the PGA Championship on Friday in a whirlwind few hours that upended the typically staid world of professional golf. \u201cI feel like my head is still spinning. I can\u2019t really explain what happened this morning. I did spend some time stretching in a jail cell. That\u2019s a first for me,\u201d Scheffler said Friday afternoon. \u201cI was fortunate to be able to make it back out and play some golf today.\u201d Scheffler, 27, was attempting to drive to the Valhalla Golf Club in Louisville, Kentucky, for the second round of the tournament at about 6 a.m. when he came to the scene of a fatal crash. He allegedly injured a police officer who was directing traffic and was then detained and arrested, according to police. Scheffler was charged with felony second-degree assault on a police officer, along with lesser charges of third-degree criminal mischief, reckless driving and disregarding signals from officers directing traffic, according to Jefferson County court records. He was released from jail and returned to the golf course for his tee time. Shortly after 10 a.m., he struck his first tee shot of the day, earning a round of applause from the crowd, and birdied the first hole. Scheffler began Friday tied for 12th place at 4-under par. After his arrest, he shot 5-under par in the second round and was tied for third place when he finished play. The arrest of the World No. 1 golfer \u2013 known as an \u201cupright, outstanding\u201d player who became a father just days ago \u2013 dramatically shook up one of golf\u2019s major tournaments. Scheffler won his second Masters title last month and\u00a0was the overwhelming favorite in the PGA Championship. Scheffler\u2019s attorney told CNN he plans to plead not guilty to the charges. In a statement, Scheffler called the incident a \u201cbig misunderstanding.\u201d \u201cThis morning, I was proceeding as directed by police officers.\u00a0It was a very chaotic situation, understandably so considering the tragic accident that had occurred earlier, and there was a big misunderstanding of what I thought I was being asked to do,\u201d he said in a statement on Instagram.\u00a0\u201cI never intended to disregard any of the instructions.\u00a0I\u2019m hopeful to put this to the side and focus on golf today.\u201d Speaking after his round, Scheffler declined to comment further on the specifics of what led to the arrest but said he believed it would be \u201cresolved fairly quickly.\u201d Scheffler said he was \u201cpretty rattled\u201d by the arrest and that his heart rate was up during play. Still, he praised the officers at the jail, who he said made jokes while he was fingerprinted, and said he was grateful for the police. What led to the arrest The incident began when Scheffler drove to the Valhalla Golf Club for the second round of the tournament around 6 a.m., according to ESPN\u2019s Jeff Darlington, who witnessed and filmed the arrest. Earlier in the morning, a pedestrian had been fatally struck by a bus while trying to cross the main road leading to the course, Louisville Metro Police Department spokesperson Dwight Mitchell said. Because of that, there was an increased police presence around the course\u2019s entrance. When Scheffler arrived in a marked player courtesy vehicle, he tried to drive around the crash scene on a median, according to ESPN, which first reported Scheffler\u2019s detention. \u201cA police officer instructed Scheffler to stop, but Scheffler continued to drive about 10 to 20 yards toward the entrance,\u201d ESPN said. \u201cScheffler then stopped his vehicle at the entrance to Valhalla. The police officer then began to scream at Scheffler to get out of the car. When Scheffler exited the vehicle, the officer shoved Scheffler against the car and immediately placed him in handcuffs,\u201d Darlington posted on X. Police escorted a handcuffed Scheffler into a police vehicle, Darlington\u2019s video shows. \u201cRight now he\u2019s going to jail,\u201d an officer at the scene says in the video. According to a Louisville Metro Police report, Scheffler was trying to gain access to the golf course when he was stopped by an officer wearing a full police uniform and a yellow reflective rain jacket. The officer, identified as Det. Bryan Gillis, stopped Scheffler and attempted to give instructions. \u201cSubject refused to comply and accelerated forward, dragging Detective Gillis to the ground,\u201d the report states. The detective suffered pain, swelling and abrasions to his left wrist and knee and was taken to the hospital for further treatment, the report states. His uniform pants, valued at about $80, \u201cwere damaged beyond repair,\u201d the report adds. In a statement Saturday, Louisville police echoed what Mayor Craig\u00a0Greenberg previously told CNN Saturday, saying there is no body camera footage showing the arrest of Scheffler. There is also no body cam video showing the beginning of the interaction, the mayor previously said. \u201cThe incident is under review internally and will proceed through the judicial process. We would like to restate that all parties involved are fully cooperating. LMPD is committed to a thorough investigation for all involved,\u201d the agency told CNN on Saturday. Meanwhile, other camera angles of the incident and arrest are still being reviewed by officials, Greenberg told CNN. It is not clear whether Gillis was wearing a body camera when he stopped Scheffler and, if he was, why it was not recording. The agency\u2019s policy requires officers wear body cameras \u201cwhen responding to any call for service \u2026 prior to arriving on-scene and exiting their vehicle.\u201d The LMPD did not respond to questions about whether any department policies were violated during the incident. Attorney says Scheffler \u2018did not do anything wrong\u2019 Scheffler\u2019s attorney, Steven Romines, told CNN in a statement Friday that Scheffler was headed to the golf course to prepare for his tee time at the\u00a0PGA Championship. \u201cDue to the combination of event traffic and a traffic fatality in the area it was a very chaotic situation. He was proceeding as directed by another traffic officer and driving a marked player\u2019s vehicle with credentials visible,\u201d Romines said. \u201cIn the confusion, Scottie is alleged to have disregarded a different officer\u2019s traffic signals resulting in these charges.\u201d Romines says multiple eyewitnesses have confirmed that Scheffler \u201cdid not do anything wrong\u201d but drove as directed. \u201cHe stopped immediately upon being directed to and never at any point assaulted any officer with his vehicle,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cWe will plead not guilty and litigate this matter as needed.\u201d Scheffler\u2019s arraignment is scheduled for Tuesday. PGA of America, the organizer of the PGA Championship, identified the pedestrian who died in the earlier crash as John Mills, a worker with a vendor for the\u00a0organization. \u201cOur primary concern today remains with the family of John Mills, who lost his life in a tragic accident early this morning while reporting to work,\u201d the organization said. \u201cAs it relates to the incident involving Scottie Scheffler, we are fully cooperating as local authorities review what took place. While the legal process plays out, questions should be directed to Scheffler\u2019s attorney or local authorities.\u201d In separate statements, both the Louisville mayor and Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear offered condolences to the victim\u2019s family and described the ensuing incident with Scheffler and police as \u201cunfortunate.\u201d \u201cLMPD is fully investigating this incident and the legal process will proceed.\u00a0We appreciate everyone\u2019s cooperation,\u201d Mayor Greenberg said. The man\u2019s death \u201ctruly puts everything in perspective,\u201d Scheffler said in his statement. Scheffler became father days ago Scheffler\u2019s arrest represents a stark contrast from his clean image, said David Dusek, senior writer at Golfweek. \u201cScottie Scheffler is one of the most squeaky clean, upright, outstanding, well-respected players out here on the PGA Tour,\u201d Dusek said. \u201cHe is someone who is known for having a very calm, level head on the golf course and he keeps that when he\u2019s off the golf course as well.\u201d After a stellar 2023 campaign that saw him retain the PGA Tour\u2019s Player of the Year title, Scheffler this season has only consolidated his status as the dominant force in men\u2019s golf. Just one week after a\u00a0commanding victory at The Arnold Palmer Invitational, he mounted a stunning late charge to become the\u00a0first player to ever defend The Players Championship. Since then, the 27-year-old has looked borderline unstoppable, as\u00a0victory at the RBC Heritage\u00a0\u2013 just one week on from\u00a0easing into his second green jacket\u00a0at Augusta \u2013 made it four wins in five starts. Scheffler last week stepped away from competitive action to be with wife Meredith as she gave birth to the couple\u2019s first child, Bennett. \u201cSitting at home with the girl I dated in high school with our child and then the Green Jacket sitting in the closet is a pretty insane feeling,\u201d he said, \u201cand I just wanted to be as thankful as possible.\u201d Following play Thursday in Louisville, Scheffler was looking ahead to trying to \u201cclean up a few of the mistakes,\u201d he said. \u201cI missed two putts I felt like I should have holed today, but that\u2019s going to happen when the greens get a little chewed up,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt like there was a couple things I can clean up going into tomorrow, but overall today was a solid round.\u201d Correction: An earlier version of this story had the wrong last name for attorney Steve Romines.

{"id": "2024_05_16_europe_robert-fico-shooting-analysis-violent-attacks-intl-cmd", "text": "The horrific scenes in Slovakia following the assassination attempt on Prime Minister Robert Fico are a stark and brutal reminder of the dangers facing those who seek public office. Fico, a pro-Russia left-wing populist, was recovering Thursday after being shot multiple times in the stomach. Government ministers closely aligned with the prime minister quickly called the shooting \u201cpolitically motivated,\u201d pointing the finger of blame for the toxic political atmosphere at the opposition and the media. But Fico himself has been guilty of using emotive language in the past. He claimed the country\u2019s outgoing progressive President Zuzana \u010caputov\u00e1 was an \u201cAmerican agent\u201d and accused her \u2014 without any proof \u2014 of acting in the interests of the US financier George Soros, a frequent target for\u00a0conspiracy\u00a0theories. \u010caputov\u00e1\u2019s allies said the comments have led to death threats. The issue is obviously not isolated to Slovakia. Politics across Europe and elsewhere have become bitterly divided over the past decade, with far-right and radical left-wing populists increasing their influence both in domestic politics and at a European level. Ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza have added to these tensions, as citizens look to their leaders to take a stand on highly contentious issues. These tensions exist in the same space as a political system that obliges elected officials to meet and mix with the people who vote them into office. The shooting came at a time of extreme political divisions over Slovakia\u2019s position in the world and its future. Fico is, and has always been, a highly divisive politician. His supporters see him as a caring leader who has their interests at heart. His opponents say he is a corrupt populist whose pro-Russian leanings pose major risks. Fico\u2019s comments prompted \u010caputov\u00e1 to take legal action against Fico, suing him for defamation. Despite being one of the most popular Slovakian politicians, \u010caputov\u00e1 announced last year that she would be stepping down and would not run again. She specifically cited verbal attacks against her and her family as being among the reasons why she felt she \u201cdidn\u2019t have enough strength\u201d to serve for another term. The assassination attempt against Fico came as his coalition government is trying to push through a number of divisive measures, sparking months of large-scale peaceful protests. Fico\u2019s attempts to overhaul the criminal justice system are particularly controversial. The government is seeking to reduce penalties for corruption and has abolished the special prosecutor\u2019s office, which was tasked with investigating serious and politically sensitive corruption cases, including some that concerned people directly connected to Fico and his party, SMER. The government is also trying to shut down the public service broadcaster RTVS, planning to replace it with a new national broadcaster, which would be under tighter control of the government. That plan has sparked large-scale protests in Slovakia. Slovakia is not unique in its political divisions and move towards populism. Only this week, the Netherlands came one step closer to having a coalition government with a far-right party at its helm. In 2022, Giorgia Meloni became Italy\u2019s prime minister after running on an anti-immigration, socially conservative ticket. While both these leaders are on the right and Fico is on the left, specific definitions between the left and right are becoming less helpful across Europe in the context of populism. The swing towards populism is expected to play out in the European Parliamentary elections next month. Current polls suggest there will be enough far-right Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) that they will be able to block legislation. Political division, emotive overseas conflicts, high levels of migration and struggling economies all add to a pressure cooker that makes it dangerous to be a politician these days. Politicians are especially vulnerable to violent attacks for a few reasons. They are people whose position gives them a public platform that isn\u2019t dissimilar to that of a minor celebrity. Unlike minor celebrities, they are human representations of policies that people have extremely strong feelings about. If a politician belongs to a party that won\u2019t call for an immediate ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, they support genocide in the eyes of some voters. If a politician supported Covid lockdowns, they stripped people of their liberties, in some people\u2019s thinking. If an elected representative wants to keep funding Ukraine rather than encourage talks with Russia, some will see them as a warmonger thwarting peace. Politicians are also obliged to mix with the general public. In Britain, two sitting parliamentarians were murdered while holding meetings with the people they represented. In 2016, Jo Cox, a left-wing MP who had spoken in support of Syrian refugees, was killed by a far-right white supremacist. David Amess, a Conservative MP, was killed while meeting constituents at a church hall by an ISIS sympathiser. The threat of violence can be felt by politicians far beyond\u2019s Europe\u2019s borders. Former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was shot dead in July 2022 as he gave a campaign speech. Last year, Ecuadorian presidential candidate Fernando Villavicencio \u2013 an anti-corruption campaigner and lawmaker \u2013 was shot dead during a campaign rally, 10 days before the first round of voting. As long as they have these obligations to meet and mix, there is no amount of security that would completely remove this risk for politicians. Besides, limiting access to politicians could make the disconnect between the public and their elected representatives even worse. Finally, if you are someone looking to make a political point through a public act of violence, then who better than the human representation of what you oppose? It may be horrible to admit that politically motivated violence against a politician is an effective way of gaining attention for your cause, but that is the calculation that those who carry out these attacks will make. Attacking a random member of the public will not attract the media attention that attacking a politician will. Targeting someone with a public profile who actually represents something means that you can claim to be a political martyr rather than a simple murderer. There are two obvious ways of reducing this risk: restricting access to politicians and obtaining better intelligence on potential attackers. The first, while probably more effective, runs the risk of further alienating the public from their leaders. The second is time-consuming, requires increased investment in intelligence and security operations and results are not guaranteed. The third, less obvious, way of improving the situation is to lower the temperature of political discourse. In the days following the attack on Fico\u2019s life, the public will likely hear politicians across Europe calling for civility in politics and condemning radicalism. Next month\u2019s European elections and the discourse in the run-up to them will show how serious they are about calming political tensions.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/europe/robert-fico-shooting-analysis-violent-attacks-intl-cmd/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_china_putin-xi-meeting-china-intl-hnk", "text": "Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin pledged to deepen their strategic partnership in Beijing on Thursday, in a stark show of their growing alignment as Moscow\u2019s troops advance in Ukraine. Putin \u2014 whose delegation includes top defense and security officials \u2014 was welcomed\u00a0by Xi to Beijing\u2019s Great Hall of the People earlier with full military pageantry, heralding the start of the Russian president\u2019s two-day state visit. A sweeping joint\u00a0statement released by the two leaders laid out their countries\u2019 alignment on a host of issues including energy, trade, security, and geopolitics with specific references to Ukraine, Taiwan and conflict in the Middle East. The visit \u2014 Putin\u2019s symbolic first overseas foray since starting a\u00a0new term as Russia\u2019s president\u00a0last week \u2014 is the latest sign of tightening relations as the two bind their countries closer in the face of heavy friction with the West. The statement proclaimed that China-Russian relations have stood \u201cthe test of rapid changes in the world, demonstrating strength and stability, and are experiencing the best period in their history,\u201d the two leaders calling each other \u201cpriority partners.\u201d Putin, whose country\u2019s economy has become increasingly reliant on China since his February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, hailed the countries\u2019 \u201cpractical cooperation\u201d in meetings with Xi, noting their record bilateral trade last year, while stressing the importance of bolstering energy, industrial, and agriculture cooperation, according to Russian state media Tass. Their meeting is Putin and Xi\u2019s fourth time speaking face-to-face since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine \u2014 weeks after the two declared a \u201cno limits\u201d partnership on the sidelines of the Winter Olympics in Beijing. This week\u2019s state visit comes amid mounting international concern about the direction of the war in Ukraine amid delays to aid for Kyiv and as Russia\u2019s economy and defense complex appears unbowed by Western sanctions \u2014 a situation that United States officials have alleged is linked to Chinese support, which Beijing denies. Putin says he and Xi will discuss the war in Ukraine in informal talks later Thursday evening, which are expected to include Russia\u2019s newly appointed Defense Minister Andrey Belousov and his predecessor Sergei Shoigu, now secretary of Russia\u2019s Security Council. Mounting international pressure over Ukraine Putin\u2019s red-carpet welcome to Beijing comes a day after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced via his office that he would\u00a0halt all upcoming international visits, as his troops defend against a surprise Russian offensive in his country\u2019s northeastern Kharkiv region. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was in Kyiv earlier this week to reaffirm the Biden administration\u2019s support for Ukraine after months of Congressional delay in approving American military aid to the embattled country. Blinken pledged $2 billion\u00a0in foreign military financing and said much-needed ammunition and weapons are being rushed to the front lines. Pressure has also been mounting on Xi from both the US and Europe to ensure soaring exports from China to Russia since the start of the war aren\u2019t propping up the Kremlin\u2019s war effort. White House officials in recent weeks have confronted Beijing on what they believe is substantial support for Russia\u2019s defense industrial base \u2014 in the form of goods like machine tools, drone and turbojet engines and microelectronics exported from China. Beijing has slammed\u00a0the US as making \u201cgroundless accusations\u201d over \u201cnormal trade and economic exchanges\u201d between China and Russia. Beijing has never condemned Russia\u2019s invasion, rather it claims neutrality in the conflict and has released a vaguely articulated 12-point position on its resolution. Ahead of an expected peace conference in Switzerland next month, Xi has called for peace talks that take both sides\u2019 positions into account. \u201cChina hopes for peace and stability in Europe soon, and continues to play a constructive role,\u201d Xi said in a joint press appearance with Putin. On Ukraine, Russia said in Thursday\u2019s joint statement that it welcomed the readiness of China \u201cto play a constructive role\u201d in the political and diplomatic settlement of the conflict and that \u201cit is necessary to eliminate its root causes and adhere to the principle of the indivisibility of security,\u201d in an apparent allusion to their shared view that NATO is responsible for the conflict in Ukraine. Alignment on shared frictions This week\u2019s visit marks the leaders\u2019 43rd meeting in the more than one decade that Xi has been in power. Xi and Putin, known for their close personal chemistry, have steadily expanded their countries\u2019 diplomatic coordination and economic and security cooperation in that time \u2014 as both faced mounting frictions with the US and its allies. Even as Xi seeks to repair frayed relations with Europe and stabilize his country\u2019s ties with the US, he is widely seen as unwilling to sacrifice his partnership with Putin, who the Chinese leader sees as an indispensable partner in reshaping a world order both believe is unfairly dominated by the US and seeking to contain them. This shared worldview was also on show Thursday as Xi, speaking alongside Putin, decried a lingering \u201cCold War mentality,\u201d and said \u201cunilateral hegemony, camp confrontations and power politics threaten world peace and security of every country\u201d \u2014 using language typical of Beijing and Moscow\u2019s criticisms of the US and its allies. The two leaders said in the joint statement they will \u201cdeepen trust and cooperation\u201d in the military field by expanding the scope of joint exercises and combat training, regularly conducting joint sea and air patrols and improving the \u201ccapabilities and level of joint response to challenges and threats.\u201d Putin nodded to Xi\u2019s concerns about rising engagement between NATO and like-minded countries in Asia, calling for a \u201creliable and adequate architecture of security in the Asia-Pacific region, in which there will be no place for closed military-political alliances.\u201d \u201cWe think the creation of such alliances to be counterproductive and harmful,\u201d Putin said following meetings Thursday. In the statement, the two countries also expressed \u201cvery deep concern\u201d over what they described as US military activity with allies \u201cthat have a clear anti-Russian and anti-Chinese orientation,\u201d calling the actions \u201cextremely destabilizing.\u201d The two leaders \u201creaffirmed there can be no winners in\u00a0a nuclear war and it should never be fought,\u201d and called for revisions to global security arrangements to prevent military confrontation. Besides engagements in Beijing, which are expected to include a \u201cgala\u201d marking the two countries\u2019 75 years of diplomatic ties, Putin is also expected to attend trade and cooperation forums in Harbin, the capital of China\u2019s northeastern Heilongjiang province bordering Russia\u2019s Far East. The region is historically a site of long-simmering border tensions between the two neighbors, which erupted in conflict between China and the Soviet Union in 1969. It has seen increasing connectivity with parts of Russia\u2019s Far East in recent years. Putin is also expected to meet with the students and faculty of the Harbin Institute of Technology, a university sanctioned by the US government in 2020 for its alleged role in procuring items for China\u2019s military.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/china/putin-xi-meeting-china-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "world"}}

The Irishman levelled the lowest score ever carded at a men\u2019s major with a spectacular nine-under 62 in his third round on Saturday to soar within two strokes of leading duo Collin Morikawa and Xander Schauffele, but would have posted an unprecedented 61 had his putt at the final hole settled four inches to the right. Chasing his 10th birdie of the day at Kentucky\u2019s Valhalla Golf Club, Lowry weighted his attempt at history perfectly from just inside 12-feet but was left to tap in for par as his ball cruelly arced away from the cup at the death. \u201cProbably the most disappointed anyone can ever be shooting 62. I knew what was at stake,\u201d Lowry, chasing a second major crown after Open Championship glory in 2019, told reporters. \u201cJust didn\u2019t hit the ball hard enough. Had it on a good read and [it] just broke away from the hole \u2026 I knew I just really wanted to hole it. Probably too much. \u201cIt would have been a pretty cool moment to kind of seal the deal and do it,\u201d he added. \u201cBut at the end of the day, I knew even if I didn\u2019t do it that I did what I needed to do today, and I\u2019m pretty happy with that.\u201d It marks just the fifth 62 in men\u2019s major history but the second since Thursday, when Schauffele opened with the lowest round ever seen in 106 editions of the tournament. The American had been the last golfer to achieve the feat at a major after shooting the same score at last year\u2019s US Open, with compatriot Rickie Fowler (also 2023 US Open), South Africa\u2019s Branden Grace (2017 Open Championship) \u2013 and now Lowry \u2013 the only others to ever shoot as low at one of the four flagship events. A grandstand finish looms World No. 3 Schauffele led the field heading into the weekend but was hunted down by compatriot Morikawa and a flurry of others on a low-scoring afternoon, teeing up a tantalizing grandstand finish on Sunday. A double bogey at the 15th threatened to derail Schauffele\u2019s pursuit of a first major but he recovered well with two closing birdies to card 68 and maintain pace at 15-under overall with 2020 champion Morikawa, who shot 67. \u201cYou want the lead,\u201d Schauffele told reporters. \u201cAgainst these guys, you want as many shots as you can possibly take, no matter how nerve-racking it can be.\u201d Fellow American Sahith Theegala roared back after a poor start to move within a stroke of the leading duo, pouring in five birdies across the final 10 holes \u2013 including a mesmerizing chip-in from the greenside rough at the 11th \u2013 to card 67. Lowry is among the chasing pack bunched behind the American trio, joined by 2020 US Open champion Bryson DeChambeau and Norway\u2019s world No. 7 Viktor Hovland. Just five strokes separate Schauffele and Morikawa from the six golfers level in tied-10th. Jordan Spieth posted a strong 67 but \u2013 seven shots back at eight-under overall \u2013 will need to deliver something truly special on Sunday if he is to become just sixth player to win all four majors in the modern era. Scheffler slides Yet tournament favorite Scottie Scheffler, one shot behind Spieth in tied-24th, will require even greater heroics after enduring a grueling two-over 73. The world No. 1 had looked his usual unflappable self as he shot 66 mere hours after being released from jail on Friday, but \u2013 with usual caddie Ted Scott away at his daughter\u2019s graduation \u2013 toiled from the outset of his third round. Scheffler managed to slow a nosediving start that saw him four-over par after just four holes, but struggled for consistency throughout to shoot over par for the first time since August of last year, ending a remarkable run of 41 consecutive events of par or lower. Scheffler had taken a one shot lead into the final 18 holes before easing to victory at the Masters last month, but will have overturn an eight shot deficit to make it back-to-back major wins. He will tee off alongside fellow Texan Mark Hubbard at 12:15 p.m. ET (5:15 p.m. BST) Sunday, with leading duo Schauffele and Morikawa the last pair out at 2:35 p.m. ET (7:35 p.m. BST).", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/18/sport/shane-lowry-record-pga-championship-scheffler-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_05_13_africa_meghan-nigeria-tour-int-latam", "text": "The Duke and Duchess of Sussex embarked on what was officially dubbed a 3-day private visit to Nigeria, yet it unfolded with all the grandeur and attention typically reserved for royal tours. Their first day saw them receive a red-carpet welcome complete with cultural dancers following their arrival in the Nigerian capital\u00a0of\u00a0Abuja, where they kicked off a multi-day mental health summit at Lightway Academy. There, they also unveiled a partnership between their Archewell Foundation and the\u00a0GEANCO Foundation to provide students with school supplies and menstrual products. The pair had been invited to the West African nation by the country\u2019s highest-ranking military official, Christopher Musa. After meeting him at the\u00a0Nigerian Defence Headquarters, Meghan signed a guest book thanking officials for \u201cwelcoming me home.\u201d Despite the private nature of their visit, the couple\u2019s itinerary resembled previous official tours they carried out before stepping back as senior working royals in 2020. They were warmly received everywhere they went, with Nigerians showcasing their famed hospitality. The couple were showered with gifts, including\u00a0a touching portrait of a young Harry with his mum. For both Nigeria and the Sussexes, this visit held significant weight. It was an opportunity for Nigeria to demonstrate its capability to host such high-profile guests and dispel any doubts raised by skeptics, especially considering the country\u2019s standing in the eyes of the UK\u2019s Foreign Office as one of the most dangerous countries to visit in the world. Nigeria has security issues with a terrorist insurgency in the northeast and northwest.\u00a0However, it is a huge country \u2014\u00a0 larger than the US state of Texas\u00a0 \u2014 and the other areas\u00a0visited by the royal couple over the past several days are relatively safe. Meanwhile, for Prince Harry and Meghan, this marked their first major trip to Africa since relinquishing\u00a0their official royal duties. It was a chance for them to engage in a hearts-and-minds charm offensive, which they executed with aplomb. Meghan, in particular, embraced exploring her Nigerian ancestry\u00a0after discovering several years ago\u00a0that she is 43% Nigerian\u00a0through a genealogy test. On Saturday, she co-hosted a women\u2019s leadership event with Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Director-General of the World Trade Organisation, for about 50 leading women from across Nigerian society and politics, business, media, and culture. During a panel discussion, moderated by Nigerian media mogul Mo Abudu, the duchess\u00a0spoke passionately about uncovering\u00a0her Nigerian roots and its significance to her own identity. She described Nigeria as \u201cmy country,\u201d adding\u00a0that \u201cbeing African American, part of it is not knowing so much about your lineage or background, where you come from specifically. And it was exciting \u2026 to discover more and understand what that really means.\u201d It was here that Meghan\u2019s natural ability to connect really shone through. She chatted\u00a0effortlessly with attendees, posed\u00a0for selfies and engaged\u00a0in heartfelt conversations. At another event on Sunday at the prestigious Delborough Hotel in Lagos\u00a0- where the great and good of Nigerian society had gathered to welcome the couple\u00a0-\u00a0she appeared visibly moved when three powerful traditional rulers honored her with royal titles. The Obi of Onitsha, His Majesty Igwe Nnaemeka Alfred Ugochukwu Achebe christened Meghan \u201cAda Mazi,\u201d which means \u201cthe daughter of the Igbo ancestral palace.\u201d While, the Oluwo of Iwoland, southwest, Nigeria,\u00a0Oba Abdulrasheed Adewale Akanbi christened her with the Yoruba name of \u201cAdetokunbo\u201d which means \u201croyalty from across the seas.\u201d Their engagements during the three-day visit were centered around their core passions:\u00a0sports rehabilitation,\u00a0mental health, and women\u2019s empowerment. For Harry\u2019s part, the duke\u00a0demonstrated his compassion and connection to his late mother, Princess Diana, as he visited wounded soldiers at a military hospital in Kaduna, 150 miles from Abuja. His first stop was to drop in on the governor of Kaduna state, Senator Uba Sani, where he was again welcomed by a troupe of dancers and a red carpet.\u00a0Governor Sani sat opposite him and praised Harry as a \u201csymbol of courage,\u201d and \u201cpraised his service to his country.\u201d He added, \u201cPlease give our regards to the Duchess of Sussex, Princess Meghan.\u201d Harry toured about six wards at the Nigerian Army Reference\u00a0Hospital and met young men recuperating from their injuries. Many had been shot, ambushed by Boko Haram, or lost limbs due to blasts. One moment captured by photographer Misan Harriman, showing Harry holding a wounded soldier lying on the hospital bed resonated deeply and went viral on social media. Corporal Yusef, 23, who had been shot through the knee, spoke with the duke, who\u00a0asked him about his rehab. \u201cAre you going to try for the Invictus Games team? Are you preparing for that?\u2026 We will see you there,\u201d Harry said. Their visit also extended to cultural experiences, such as witnessing a vibrant dance performance and a polo match at the historic Lagos Polo Club. Polo holds special significance for Harry and the event provided a platform to showcase his longstanding commitment to the sport and its charitable endeavors. Amid the festivities, the couple expressed gratitude for Nigeria\u2019s warm reception.\u00a0As they bid farewell to Nigeria, Meghan declared: \u201cI can\u2019t wait to come back!\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/africa/meghan-nigeria-tour-int-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_asia_south-korea-space-out-competition-intl-hnk", "text": "More than 100 people gathered silently on yoga mats over the weekend to do absolutely nothing, in a Seoul event that is part physical challenge, part art piece, and part respite from South Korea\u2019s hyper-competitive society. The annual Space-out competition, held on Sunday, finds who\u2019s best at zoning out for 90 minutes without falling asleep, checking their phone or talking. Participants\u2019 heart rates are monitored, while onlookers vote for their 10 favorite contestants. Whoever has the most stable heart rate among the 10 takes home the trophy. Among those taking part was speed skater Kwak Yoon-gy, a double Olympic silver medalist. \u201cI tried out for the Olympics five times and have never taken a proper rest while training for 30 years,\u201d said the 34-year-old short-track specialist, who took third place. \u201cI heard this place is where I can clear my mind and rest at least during this time, so I came here thinking, \u2018Wow, this is what I needed so much.\u2019\u201d More than 4,000 people applied to participate in the competition, hosted by the city government. The 117 contestants selected ranged from a child in second grade to people in their 60s. For many participants, it was a way to recover from burnout and stress, often from their work, in a country with high academic stress and extreme pressure to succeed. \u201cI usually had a lot of worries and stress, so I applied [to participate] because I thought it would be nice to blow away such stress and worries by spacing out in the competition,\u201d said 26-year-old YouTuber Kim Seok-hwan. This year marks the tenth anniversary of the Space-out competition, founded by a visual artist, who goes by the pseudonym Woopsyang, after she suffered severe burnout.  \u201cI wondered why I was so anxious about doing nothing,\u201d she recalled, adding that that\u2019s when she realized her anxiety came from comparing herself to other people leading busy lives. \u201cIn fact, those people could also be wanting to space out and do nothing like me,\u201d Woopsyang said. \u201cSo, I created a competition thinking that it would be nice to pause all together at the same place at the same time.\u201d Competitive idling \u201coverturns the social convention that spacing out is a waste of time in today\u2019s busy society and turns it into a valuable activity,\u201d she said. \u201cThis contest tells you that spacing out is no longer a waste of time but a time that you really need.\u201d The competition is also performance art, she said. \u201cAlthough the contestants are staying still inside the competition venue, the audience is constantly moving around,\u201d Woopsyang said, adding her goal was to \u201ccreate a visual contrast between a group that does nothing and a group that is busy.\u201d Since the first Space-out competition was held in Seoul in 2014, it has expanded internationally, with contests taking place in various cities such as Beijing, Rotterdam, Taipei, Hong Kong and Tokyo. This year\u2019s competition in Seoul was won by freelance announcer Kwon So-a, who works multiple jobs, and took home a trophy shaped like the Auguste Rodin sculpture \u201cThe Thinker.\u201d \u201cEspecially here in Korea, it\u2019s such a competitive country, where people think that if they do nothing that they are a little behind,\u201d Kwon, 35, said. \u201cI think everyone has to have their own pace and sometimes just slow down.\u201d Doing nothing is \u201cgood for your mental health as well as your physical health because your body has to relax, but your body can only relax when your brain relaxes,\u201d she added. \u201cFor both of these reasons, people should space out.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/asia/south-korea-space-out-competition-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_17_middleeast_gaza-floating-pier-aid-trucks-intl-hnk", "text": "Trucks carrying humanitarian aid into Gaza have begun moving ashore after arriving through the floating pier built by the US military, according to the US Central Command (CENTCOM). The pier was anchored to a beach in Gaza on Thursday and will be used to funnel aid from various countries into the besieged strip, with most border crossings to the enclave closed and a catastrophic humanitarian disaster unfolding inside. No US troops went ashore in Gaza, according to CENTCOM. The goal is to get about 500 tons of humanitarian assistance into Gaza through the pier daily, according to Adm. Brad Cooper, the commander of CENTCOM. That means about 90 trucks worth of aid a day, and the goal is to build up to 150 trucks a day. Over 300 pallets of humanitarian aid were delivered to Gaza through a new floating pier installed by the US military, according to a statement from Israel Defense Forces (IDF) on Saturday. On Friday, the UN humanitarian agency, OCHA, said Gaza was facing a \u201cdire\u201d food situation with barely more than 300 aid trucks entering the strip since Israel began its offensive in Rafah. The maritime corridor is coming at a critical moment \u2013 with the Rafah border crossing to Gaza having been closed for more than a week, preventing aid from getting through. That crossing was the only one between Gaza and Egypt \u2013 with all other border points in the strip controlled by Israel. Here\u2019s what we know about the new aid route: How was the pier built and how will it work? The US began building the floating pier in late April at a cost of $320 million and with the help of some 1,000 US soldiers and sailors. The US said that it is only a temporary measure that is \u201centirely humanitarian in nature.\u201d Pieces for the pier were loaded aboard ships on the East Coast of the US and then \u201ctransported 6,000 miles across the ocean,\u201d according to CENTCOM\u2019s Cooper. The pieces were assembled off the coast of Gaza, with final assembly taking place in the Israeli port of Ashdod. The aid delivered via the pier will go through several steps before reaching Gaza. It will arrive in Cyprus by either air or sea where it will be screened by the US and Israel and palletized before being brought by ship to a floating platform near the Gaza coast. Then it is finally transported to the floating pier and loaded onto trucks to distribute on land. The US has said the pier is not meant to replace aid that enters through land crossings, which aid workers have said are the fastest and easiest way to get relief into the territory. \u201cThis maritime route is additive and is not meant to replace land routes into Gaza,\u201d Cooper said. The UN\u2019s World Food Programme will be responsible for receiving and distributing the aid in Gaza. Why is aid being shipped this way? Most land crossings into Gaza remain either shut or congested due to lengthy inspections by Israel. That has led the US and other countries to start air-dropping aid into Gaza, which human rights organizations have criticized as insufficient. The UN has warned of famine setting in in parts of Gaza, calling on Israel to open more land crossings for aid. USAID Administrator Samantha Power, the top US humanitarian official, has also assessed it is \u201ccredible\u201d that famine is already occurring in parts of Gaza. In March, the first batch of humanitarian aid by sea was delivered in an operation separate from the US pier project. Today, only the Israeli-controlled Kerem Shalom crossing and the \u201cWestern Erez\u201d Crossing in northern Gaza are open, although the amount of aid trickling through them is nowhere close to what Gaza needs. The UN\u2019s World Food Programme however says that since May 6, when Israel launched its Rafah operation, the organization has been unable to access and receive aid from the Kerem Shalom crossing. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees\u00a0(UNRWA) said the crossing was closed between May 6-10. The Rafah crossing with Egypt, the entry point for nearly a quarter of all aid into Gaza, was also closed last week after Israel seized it as part of a ground offensive into the city, and is yet to reopen. How much aid is getting into Gaza now? The US State Department has said that \u201cnot nearly enough\u201d trucks are getting into Gaza. The UN estimates that 500 trucks are needed per day to alleviate the suffering of Gazans, but on May 11, UN figures showed that only six trucks entered. No data is available after that date. The UN agency stressed that more aid should be allowed to pass through checkpoints and enter Gaza by land. \u201cAny and all aid into Gaza is welcome by any route. However, getting aid to people in need, into and across Gaza, cannot and should not depend on a floating dock,\u201d OCHA spokesperson Jens Laerke said Friday. Israel however said on Friday\u00a0that \u201caid is flowing into Gaza by land, sea, and air\u201d and through \u201cmultiple aid routes.\u201d The Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), the Israeli body that coordinates the flow of aid into the strip, said that 365 trucks \u201cwere transferred\u201d to Gaza Thursday. The UN\u2019s OCHA on Thursday said that crossings into Gaza have either been closed, are unsafe to access or not logistically viable. \u201cAid distribution is almost impossible with no regular fuel imports, unstable telecommunication and ongoing fighting,\u201d OCHA said on X. \u201cThe impact is devastating for over 2 million people.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/middleeast/gaza-floating-pier-aid-trucks-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_17_style_unseen-photos-royal-family-gbr-scli-intl", "text": "As Queen for 70 years, Elizabeth II was probably one of the most photographed women in history. Yet almost two years after her death, new pictures of Britain\u2019s longest-reigning monarch have emerged for an exhibition opening at Buckingham Palace this week. Among the most striking is a touching image from 1964 of four royal mothers and their babies - including the Queen and her youngest son, Prince Edward. Alongside them are the Queen\u2019s sister, Princess Margaret, plus Princess Alexandra and the Duchess of Kent, all holding their newborn babies. The never-before-seen image was taken by Princess Margaret\u2019s then-husband, photographer Antony Armstrong-Jones - or Lord Snowdon as he was known as then - as a personal thanks for the royal obstetrician who delivered the four babies within two months of that year. Shown alongside it is a handwritten letter from Princess Margaret to her sister in which she asks \u201cDarling Lilibet\u201d to sign a print \u201cas a souvenir of an extraordinary two months of delivery.\u201d \u201cRoyal Portraits: A Century of Photography,\u201d which opened in The King\u2019s Gallery of the palace on Friday, has more than 150 items from the Royal Collection and Royal Archives, which chart the evolution of royal portrait photography since the 1920s. Also on show for the first time are several wartime images taken by Cecil Beaton, who captured the royal family on camera over six decades. Among them is one of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth inspecting bomb damage at the palace in 1940, while another shows them with their two daughters - Elizabeth and Margaret - around the King\u2019s desk at the Royal Lodge in Windsor. Beaton was the official photographer for Elizabeth\u2019s coronation in 1953. The exhibition features a contact sheet of proofs of the coronation sitting, alongside a note from Martin Charteris, the Queen\u2019s assistant private secretary, recommending to Prince Philip which images should be sent to the royal family and maids of honor. The picture that was subsequently chosen and sent to the Queen Mother can also be seen, signed by both the Queen, her husband and Beaton. In a week where many headlines were made about the new official painting of the King, the exhibition offers an altogether different view of Charles. It features a black and white shot of Charles, then a young prince, alongside his sister, Princess Anne, in 1956. There are numerous official photographs taken to mark royal birthdays, including a portrait by Beaton of Princess Margaret for her 25th birthday - together with her dog Pippin.  Separately, she and her sister, the Queen, can be seen laughing and talking in a contact sheet of images shot by Norman Parkinson on the occasion of their mother\u2019s 80th birthday. Another highlight is the earliest surviving color print of a member of the royal family. Taken in 1935 by pioneering female photographer Madame Yevonde, it shows Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester - sister-in-law to King George VI and Edward VIII - on her wedding day. The exhibition, which runs until October, charts the innovations in portraiture, featuring Andy Warhol\u2019s 1985 image of the Queen sprinkled with diamond dust and Rankin\u2019s 2001 photograph of the smiling monarch, superimposed against the union flag. Meanwhile, Paolo Roversi\u2019s memorable 40th birthday portrait of the Princess of Wales, shows Catherine bearing a striking resemblance to Alexandra, Princess of Wales, by Franz Xaver Winterhalter in 1864. Curator Alessandro Nasini said in a press release: \u201cThe Royal Collection holds some of the most enduring photographs ever taken of the Royal Family, captured by the most celebrated portrait photographers of the past hundred years \u2013 from Dorothy Wilding and Cecil Beaton to Annie Leibovitz, David Bailey, and Rankin. \u201cAlongside these beautiful vintage prints, which cannot be on permanent display for conservation reasons, we are excited to share archival correspondence and never-before-seen proofs that will give visitors a behind-the-scenes insight into the process of creating such unforgettable royal portraits.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/style/unseen-photos-royal-family-gbr-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "world_asia_romulus-whitaker-snakeman-india-spc-c2e", "text": "Moving from America to India as a child in the 1950s would likely be a challenging experience for most, but for Romulus Whitaker it was a dream come true \u2014 he had arrived in \u201cthe land of cobras,\u201d he explained to CNN. Whitaker would go on to earn the nickname \u201cSnakeman of India,\u201d and spend more than six decades dedicated to reptile research and conservation. He\u2019s written several books on snakes, spearheaded a lifesaving anti-venom program, and launched wildlife research stations throughout the country. His field work with snakes and crocodiles ultimately led his conservation efforts to help save India\u2019s rainforests. Today, Whitaker\u2019s focus is on educating Indians on how to protect themselves from snakes \u2014 part of a national campaign to reduce the snakebite mortality rate. CNN spoke with Whitaker recently at his home in Mysore, southwestern India, around the release of the first volume of his memoir: \u201cSnakes, Drugs and Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll: My Early Years.\u201d The following interview has been edited for length and clarity. CNN: How did you first become interested in snakes? Whitaker: I started out as a very young lad in northern New York state, turning over rocks and finding bugs and stuff, until I found a snake, and it was love at first sight. It really started then. But I must blame or thank my mother for when I first brought a snake home. She said, \u2018wow, how beautiful.\u2019 And now, which mother would do that? Not very many. Then, when my mother married Rama Chattopadhyay and we moved to India, that was something that opened up the world to me. Can you imagine an eight-year-old arriving in Bombay and being able to go out into the jungles of India? These are dreams that I had when I was a little kid, which came alive. CNN: What does a herpetologist do and what was your journey to becoming one? Whitaker: A herpetologist is a strange person who studies reptiles. I\u2019ve concentrated most of my work on snakes and crocodiles, but I am very interested in all the others \u2026 the turtles, the lizards, and of course the amphibians, the frogs and toads. I\u2019ve been doing this forever, ever since I was four years old when I picked up my first snake. [In 1960] I was going to college in America, but I flunked out. Then I got a job at the Miami Serpentarium and worked for this gentleman [Bill Haast] who handled king cobras with the greatest of ease and extracted their venom. That was part of the love affair that I generated for king cobras. But I had always yearned to come back to India and get out to Western Ghats, where I knew king cobras still lived, and start studying them. In 1969, I set up India\u2019s first snake park, the Madras Snake Park. And we\u2019ve learned more about king cobra behavior and about their wonderful lifestyle than had ever been known by anybody before. CNN: Have you ever been scared of a snake? Whitaker: I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been scared of a snake. I\u2019ve been scared of myself sometimes doing stupid things. I saw a black-tailed [snake] disappearing into the bushes, and I thought, \u2018ah, big rat snake.\u2019 And I dove on it, typical football tackle, grabbed it by the tail and suddenly this hooded snake rises up over me and I looked up and said, \u2018oh no, I think I\u2019ve caught the wrong tail.\u2019 And I let it go. It was a king cobra, the first one I had ever found. It was scary. Okay, I am scared sometimes. CNN: How did you first get involved with the indigenous Irula tribe to help create anti-venom to treat people bitten by snakes? Whitaker: The Irulas are an aboriginal tribe here in South India. Their expertise is finding and catching snakes and their specialty [was] catching snakes for their skins. But they had run out of a way to make a living because the snakeskin industry had been banned [in 1972]. So we hatched an idea together to set up a venom cooperative, the Irula Snake Catchers Cooperative, wherein they would catch snakes from the wild, extract the venom, and then release the snakes back to the wild. And the venom, it was used to make anti-venom to save millions of lives. CNN: Today a big focus of your work is preventing snakebites in the first place. Tell us more about that. Whitaker: Up until recently, we really didn\u2019t know how many people are getting killed and injured by snakes. The Centre for Global Health Research and the University of Toronto started doing this Million Deaths Study. And I\u2019m a coauthor of two of the major papers produced out of this study, and it turns out that close to 50,000 people are actually killed by snake bite every year in India. Now that we know the figure, we are working very hard right now on an educational program, which is nationwide, trying to teach people how to avoid snakes and avoid getting bitten. It\u2019s fairly simple: at night when you walk around, use a light. When you sleep, use a mosquito net. We tell people when they\u2019re working in the field, when they\u2019re doing agriculture, use a stick. Don\u2019t use your bare hand because a snake could be there. So it\u2019s just educating people. These are simple methods. CNN: At what point in your career did you get involved with conservation? Whitaker: My early, formative years were not very conservation-oriented. I was the kid with a gun, and I would go out there and instead of being a bird watcher, I was a bird shooter. The transition from being from a hunter to a conservationist happened [in the 1970s] when I realized that things were really out of hand here, and crocodiles were almost extinct by that time. And we really had to do something about it. I realized that unless I got into conservation, there\u2019s not going to be anything left. I set up field stations along with my colleagues and they are magnets for people who want to get into working with reptiles. And we\u2019ve had dozens and dozens of people who have now turned out to be some of the greatest conservationists in India we can call graduates of these stations. CNN: You\u2019re currently working on a three-part memoir. What would you like your legacy to be? Whitaker: People will remember me, like it or not, as a snake freak. But it\u2019s wonderful to think [of] the influence that I have had or that our organizations have had to engender this incredible deep interest in something which people sneered at or ran away from all their lives, but now suddenly, hey, they\u2019re interesting, they\u2019re hip, they\u2019re in. Snakes rule! And it\u2019s wonderful to realize that dozens, if not hundreds, of young people have continued to do wonderful work with reptiles. It\u2019s just wonderful.", "source": "http://cnn.com/world/asia/romulus-whitaker-snakeman-india-spc-c2e/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_12_europe_sergei-shoigu-putin-replaces-defense-minister-intl-latam", "text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin has replaced his defense minister and a long-time close ally Sergei Shoigu with an economist, a major reshuffle of military leadership more than two years after Moscow\u2019s grinding war against Ukraine has sent defense spending soaring. Andrey Belousov, a civilian who served as former first deputy prime minister and specializes in economics, was appointed to the top defense post, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Sunday. Peskov tried to downplay the move, but the reshuffle comes amid speculation about\u00a0infighting at the highest echelons of power. Just last month, one of Shoigu\u2019s long-time prot\u00e9g\u00e9s at the defense ministry was arrested and charged with corruption. Shoigu was \u201crelieved\u201d of his position by presidential decree, Peskov said, but he will remain an influential part of Putin\u2019s administration as secretary of Russia\u2019s Security Council, replacing Nikolai Patrushev, a former head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who would \u201ctransfer to another job.\u201d Shoigu will also become the deputy in Russia\u2019s Military-Industrial Commission, Peskov said, as Putin embarks on a fifth term as president. The timing of Shoigu\u2019s exit is notable, coming off the back of several significant advances by Russian troops in eastern Ukraine. Russia has launched its most serious cross-border ground assault since Ukraine recaptured the northern Kharkiv region in the late summer of 2022. There have been several months of increased Russian air attacks on the city of Kharkiv amid a grinding advance in Donetsk in the east that has seen incremental but significant progress. Shoigu had helmed the country\u2019s defense ministry for 12 years and led the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Russian troops initially caught Kyiv by surprise but were soon beaten back, exposing the weaknesses of Moscow\u2019s corruption-riddled military and its willingness to send waves of poorly trained and equipped soldiers into what Ukraine and Russian troops have both dubbed a \u201cmeat grinder.\u201d His critics have frequently described Shoigu as remote and out-of-touch with the realities of the conflict. His most forceful critic was the late Wagner chief\u00a0Yevgeny Prigozhin\u00a0who accused the Defense Ministry of starving his fighters of resources and bureaucratic incompetence before launching an unsuccessful mutiny last year and dying weeks later in a plane crash. Despite the criticism, Shoigu has remained a popular politician in Russia. Having spent two decades as the minister of emergency situations, he cultivated an image of a helpful official who brings help when it\u2019s needed. He is also a rare outsider in Putin\u2019s original inner circle, which consists mostly of the president\u2019s allies from his St. Petersburg political beginnings and his former KGB colleagues. Shoigu was born and grew up in the remote Siberian republic of Tuva and got into politics through his association with the former president Boris Yeltsin. Rising military spending and need for \u2018innovation\u2019 Belousov\u2019s appointment suggests Russia\u2019s strategy will continue to focus on outgunning Ukraine. Belousov was selected by Putin because of a need for \u201cinnovation,\u201d Peskov said in a press call, during which he highlighted the ministry\u2019s rising budget, saying it was approaching levels last seen during the Cold War. \u201cToday on the battlefield, the winner is the one who is more open to innovation,\u201d Peskov said. \u201cTherefore, it is natural that at the current stage, the president decided that the Russian Ministry of Defense should be headed by a civilian.\u201d In a reference to the war in Ukraine, Peskov said that due to \u201cwell-known geopolitical circumstances, we are gradually approaching the situation of the mid-80s when the share of expenses for the security bloc in the economy was 7.4%. It\u2019s not critical, but it\u2019s extremely important,\u201d Peskov said. The budget currently amounts to 6.7% of GDP, he said. Peskov highlighted Belousov\u2019s previous leadership experience and economic background. \u201cThis is not just a civilian, but a person who very successfully headed the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia, for a long time he was aide to the president on economic issues, and was also the first deputy chairman of the government in the previous cabinet of ministers,\u201d Peskov said. Much has been made of Belousov\u2019s civilian status, even though Shoigu himself has limited hands-on experience with the military. He holds a rank of a general as a result of his official roles and has never served in active service. Peskov added that the new appointment did not signal a shift in Russia\u2019s current military system. \u201cAs for the military component, this appointment will in no way change the current coordinate systems. The military component has always been the prerogative of the Chief of the General Staff [Valery Gerasimov], and he will continue his activities. No changes are currently envisaged\u00a0in\u00a0this\u00a0regard,\u201d he said. In his new role, Shoigu will oversee Russia\u2019s military industrial complex, Peskov said. \u201cHe is deeply immersed in this work, he knows very well the pace of production of military-industrial products at specific enterprises and often visits these enterprises,\u201d he said. The news follows the arrest last month of one of Shoigu\u2019s close allies, deputy defense minister Timur Ivanov, who was charged with taking a bribe in what was the country\u2019s highest-profile corruption scandal since Putin launched his full invasion of Ukraine more than two years ago. Ivanov has been accused of accepting a bribe of 1 million rubles (at least $10,800), according to Russian state media TASS. Former US Secretary of Defense Mark Esper told CNN in an interview Sunday that Putin\u2019s reshuffle is an \u201cimportant\u201d and \u201cinteresting move.\u201d \u201cThe bigger argument coming out of Moscow right now is that Russia is moving toward a war economy,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re on a war footing.\u201d Esper said that \u201cone of the disappointing things about Shoigu\u2019s tenure is we thought the Russian army, at least during my time at the Pentagon, we thought they were professionalizing, that they were modernizing all their equipment, their doctrine, how they train and fight, and we really haven\u2019t seen that on the battlefield.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/12/europe/sergei-shoigu-putin-replaces-defense-minister-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_12_europe_russia-kharkiv-region-offensive-ukraine-intl", "text": "Ukraine\u2019s top general says the situation in the northern\u00a0Kharkiv region\u00a0has \u201csignificantly worsened\u201d after Russia claimed to have captured four further villages as it expanded its surprise cross-border offensive. A Ukrainian regional official insisted Russia\u2019s progress was not yet \u201csignificant\u201d but admitted ground fighting in the area was spreading. Meanwhile, speaking on British television, UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron acknowledged it was an \u201cextremely dangerous moment,\u201d adding that Russia had effectively \u201cinvaded [Ukraine] again.\u201d The precise goal of Russia\u2019s new push \u2013 which began in the early hours of Friday morning \u2013 is unclear. It may be to create a buffer zone designed to reduce Ukrainian attacks on Russian territory, or possibly even a renewed assault on the city of Kharkiv, 30 kilometers (18 miles) to the south. Equally, it could be an attempt to draw Ukrainian forces away from other key Russian objectives further south \u2013 which was the rationale Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky offered in his Sunday evening address. \u201cThe idea behind the attacks in Kharkiv region is to stretch our forces and undermine morale and the motivational foundations of Ukrainians\u2019 ability to defend ourselves,\u201d he said. According to information from the Defense Ministry in Moscow, Russia now claims control over nine Ukrainian border villages, which are clustered in two areas, now just a few dozen kilometers apart, to the northeast of Kharkiv city. A Ukrainian military blogger, Myroshnykov, said Sunday afternoon that Russian troops had now pushed south and entered the town of Vovchansk, though the pace of advance there had slowed in the face of Ukraine\u2019s defending forces. Myroshnykov went on to predict an attempt by Russia to make its numerical advantage count and throw large numbers of infantry soldiers into the battle. \u201cThey will try to seize the area with a lot of cannon fodder,\u201d he wrote on his Telegram channel, referencing previous Russian offensives which reports suggest have resulted in many Russian troops killed. A Ukrainian military spokesman later denied reports Russian forces were inside Vovchansk, saying Ukraine\u2019s armed forces had succeeded in keeping them at bay. Ahead of any stepped-up Russian actions, Ukrainian officials have been evacuating hundreds of local residents to safety. An idea of the destruction being wrought on the town and surrounding villages came from regional Ukrainian leader, Oleh Syniehubov, who said Saturday that Russia had dropped more than 20 huge glide bombs on the area in under two days. These bombs have a minimum weight of 250 kgs, but can go up to 1,500 kgs, and are among the most destructive mass-produced devices currently used by Russia in the war. They have previously been used as a precursor to a major attempt to seize ground. Oleksandr Syrskyi, Ukraine\u2019s army chief, told readers of his social media channels on Sunday that defensive operations were ongoing and that battlefield conditions were difficult. \u201cThis week, the situation in Kharkiv Oblast has significantly worsened. Currently, there are ongoing battles in the border areas along the state border with the Russian Federation,\u201d he wrote on Telegram. Syniehubov, the head of the Kharkiv Regional Military Administration, insisted control over the border villages was still contested rather than ceded, however the influential DeepStateMap group \u2013 a Ukrainian organisation monitoring developments on the battlefield \u2013 showed seven Ukrainian villages under either full or partial Russian control. So far, Russian gains are not sufficient to put its big artillery pieces within range of Kharkiv city, but residents there admit the situation is frightening. One woman, Anna Ivanova, speaking to Reuters, said: \u201cOf course it is scary, we keep on monitoring the situation, following the news but we remain home and are not planning to go anywhere. All depends on what happens.\u201d Another Kharkiv resident, Olena Pidhirna, said: \u201cDespite all those attacks, air raid alarms, we live normal lives, everyone keeps going out, playing, going to school, enjoying themselves, working. Life goes on, as normal.\u201d It is not just in Ukraine\u2019s north that Kyiv\u2019s armed forces are losing ground. DeepStateMap also shows Russia making further gains in two other key areas, most notably towards the town of Chasiv Yar, which has become an important forward military position, and further south in the industrial town of Krasnohorivka, where Russian troops are now in control of the town\u2019s main facility, a brick factory. Meanwhile, Russian authorities say eight people are known to have died in an explosion in a residential building in Belgorod. CCTV video of the blast shows a huge plume of dark grey smoke emerging from one of the building\u2019s lower floors, before part of the building collapses on itself. Russian television later broadcast video of rescuers at work looking for survivors among the rubble. Russian officials said the blast was caused by a Ukrainian missile attack. And in a separate development, a fire briefly broke out at the\u00a0Volgograd\u00a0oil\u00a0refinery, the largest oil\u00a0refinery\u00a0in southern\u00a0Russia, after a Ukrainian drone attack overnight into Sunday, according to the region\u2019s governor. \u201cOn the night of May 12, air defense and electronic warfare forces repelled a UAV attack on the territory of the\u00a0Volgograd\u00a0region,\u201d Andrey Bocharov said in a post on Telegram. \u201cAs a result of the consequences of a UAV crash with subsequent detonation, a fire broke out at the\u00a0Volgograd\u00a0Refinery\u00a0site,\u201d he said.

{"id": "2024_05_17_world_black-holes-einstein-plunging-region-scn", "text": "Albert Einstein was right: There is an area at the edge of black holes where matter can no longer stay in orbit and instead falls in, as predicted by his theory of gravity. Using telescopes capable of detecting X-rays, a team of astronomers has for the first time observed this area \u2014 called the \u201cplunging region\u201d \u2014 in a black hole about 10,000 light-years from Earth. \u201cWe\u2019ve been ignoring this region, because we didn\u2019t have the data,\u201d said research scientist Andrew Mummery, lead author of the study published Thursday in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. \u201cBut now that we do, we couldn\u2019t explain it any other way.\u201d It\u2019s not the first time that black holes have helped confirm Einstein\u2019s grand theory, which is also known as general relativity. The first photo of a black hole, captured in 2019, had previously strengthened the revolutionary physicist\u2019s core assumption that gravity is just matter bending the space-time fabric. Many of Einstein\u2019s other predictions have turned out to be correct over the years, among them gravitational waves and the universal speed limit. \u201cHe\u2019s a tough man to bet against at this point,\u201d said Mummery, a Leverhulme-Peierls Fellow in the department of physics at the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom. \u201cWe went out searching for this one specifically \u2014 that was always the plan. We\u2019ve argued about whether we\u2019d ever be able to find it for a really long time,\u201d Mummery said. \u201cPeople said it would be impossible, so confirming it\u2019s there is really exciting.\u201d \u2018Like the edge of a waterfall\u2019 The observed black hole is in a system called MAXI J1820 + 070, which is made up of a star smaller than the sun and the black hole itself, estimated at 7 to 8 solar masses. The astronomers used NASA\u2019s space-based NuSTAR and NICER telescopes to collect data and understand how hot gas, called plasma, from the star gets sucked into the black hole. NuSTAR is short for the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array, which orbits Earth, and NICER, formally known as the Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer, is located on the International Space Station. \u201cAround these black holes there are big discs of orbiting material (from nearby stars),\u201d Mummery said. \u201cMost of it is stable, which means it can happily flow. It\u2019s like a river, whereas the plunging region is like the edge of a waterfall \u2014 all of your support is gone and you\u2019re just crashing headfirst. Most of what you can see is the river, but there\u2019s this tiny region at the very end, which is basically what we found,\u201d he added, noting that while the \u201criver\u201d had been widely observed, this is the first evidence of the \u201cwaterfall.\u201d Unlike the event horizon, which is closer to the center of the black hole and doesn\u2019t let anything escape, including light and radiation, in the \u201cplunging region\u201d light can still escape, but matter is doomed by the powerful gravitational pull, Mummery explained. The study\u2019s findings could help astronomers better understand the formation and evolution of black holes. \u201cWe can really learn about them by studying this region, because it\u2019s right at the edge, so it gives us the most information,\u201d Mummery said. One thing that\u2019s missing from the study is an actual image of the black hole, because it is too small and far away. But another team of Oxford researchers is working on something even better than a picture: the first movie of a black hole. To achieve that, the team will first need to build a new observatory, the Africa Millimetre Telescope in Namibia, which Mummery expects to be online within a decade. The telescope, which will join the international Event Horizon Telescope collaboration that captured the groundbreaking 2019 image of the black hole, will enable scientists to observe and film large black holes at the center of the Milky Way galaxy and beyond. A link to the past According to Christopher Reynolds, a professor of astronomy at the University of Maryland, College Park, finding actual evidence for the \u201cplunging region\u201d is an important step that will let scientists significantly refine models for how matter behaves around a black hole. \u201cFor example, it can be used to measure the rotation rate of the black hole,\u201d said Reynolds, who was not involved in the study. Dan Wilkins, a research scientist at Stanford University in California, calls it an exciting development, and points out that in 2018 there was an enormously bright outburst of light from one of the black holes within our galaxy, paired with an excess of high-energy X-rays. \u201cWe had hypothesized at the time that this excess was from the hot material in the \u2018plunging region,\u2019 but we did not have a full theoretical prediction of what that emission would look like,\u201d said Wilkins, who also was not involved with the new study. This study actually performs that calculation, he added, using Einstein\u2019s theory of gravity to predict what the X-rays emitted by material in the \u201cplunging region\u201d would look like around a black hole, and compares it with the data from that bright outburst in 2018. \u201cThis will be prime discovery space over the next decade or so,\u201d Wilkins said, \u201cas we look towards the next generation of X-ray telescopes that will give us more detailed measurements of the innermost regions just outside the event horizons of black holes.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/world/black-holes-einstein-plunging-region-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "world"}}

Health care lags other industries such as big financial institutions and energy providers when it comes to IT security, according to some experts. \u201cIndustry has successfully demanded voluntary cybersecurity for years \u2014 and this is what we get,\u201d Joshua Corman, a cybersecurity expert who has focused on the health sector for years, told CNN. Sen. Ron Wyden, the Oregon Democrat who chairs the finance committee, told CNN that \u201cevery new devastating hack hammers home the need for mandatory cybersecurity standards in the health care sector, particularly when it comes to the largest companies that millions of patients depend on for care and medicine.\u201d Without action, the senator said, \u201cpatients\u2019 access to care and their personal health information will be compromised and ransomed by hackers over and over again.\u201d In 2023, 46 hospital systems in the US, comprising 141 hospitals, were impacted by ransomware,\u00a0according\u00a0to a tally from cybersecurity firm Emsisoft.\u00a0That\u2019s up from 25 hospital systems hit by ransomware in 2022, according to the firm. The two ransomware attacks hit different nerves of the health care system. In February, cybercriminals broke into an unsecured computer server used by Change Healthcare, an insurance billing giant that processes about 15 billion health care transactions annually. The hack cut off health care providers from billions of dollars of revenue, snarled service at pharmacies across the US and\u00a0may have compromised\u00a0the personal data of a third of Americans. In early May, cybercriminals used a different type of ransomware in an attack on Ascension, a St. Louis-based nonprofit network that includes 140 hospitals and 40 senior living facilities in 19 states. The hack\u00a0forced\u00a0the health network to divert ambulances from some hospitals. The Biden administration is preparing to issue minimum cybersecurity requirements for US hospitals, senior White House cyber official Anne Neuberger confirmed this month. The details of that proposal have yet to be finalized. But the American Hospital Association, which represents hospitals across the United States, opposes the proposal, saying it would effectively re-victimize victims of cyberattacks by imposing penalties after they are hacked. Officials at the Department of Health and Human Services previously said\u00a0they are willing to use a number of measures,\u00a0including\u00a0imposing\u00a0monetary fines, to both force and encourage health care organizations to better secure their systems. Momentum is also growing on Capitol Hill to force health care organizations to meet basic cybersecurity standards. A bill\u00a0introduced\u00a0in March by Sen. Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, would allow \u201cadvanced and accelerated\u201d Medicare payments to be sent to hacked health care providers as long as those providers and their contractors meet minimum cybersecurity standards. An unhealthy situation The ransomware attacks on Change Healthcare and Ascension have spotlighted the health sector\u2019s cybersecurity weakness like no other events before it, experts told CNN. And even if there are new regulatory requirements for cybersecurity, the sector \u201cwill continue to struggle from such attacks if the business of providing\u00a0healthcare remains financially fraught [and forces] leaders to prioritize only revenue generating investments,\u201d Carter Groome, chief executive of cybersecurity firm First Health Advisory, told CNN. The Change Healthcare ransomware attack, in particular, has brought fresh attention from policymakers and experts on what many see as the over-consolidation of the US health care industry. If hackers can defeat security measures at one company, millions of patients who rely on that health network can be affected. \u201cUS healthcare is in a death spiral,\u201d said Corman, who co-founded I am the Cavalry, a volunteer group that focuses on cybersecurity for resource-poor organizations in the health sector, among others. \u201cDistressed hospitals get acquired into too-big-to-fail conglomerates. Ransoms cause distress for the little ones, and multi-week, multi-state outages for the ones \u2018saved\u2019 by the big ones.\u201d Any new cybersecurity regulations should be strong enough to force meaningful improvements in the sector\u2019s cybersecurity, Corman argued. \u2018Yes. cybersecurity is costly,\u201d he said. \u201cAs we can clearly see\u2026 neglect is more costly.\u201d Change Healthcare\u2019s parent firm, UnitedHealth Group, owns a significant portion of the US health care market. The company, which reported $371 billion in revenue last year, handles one in three American patient records,\u00a0according\u00a0to the American Hospital Association. Optum, a UnitedHealth subsidiary, employs about 90,000 physicians. \u201cYour revenues are bigger than some countries\u2019 GDP,\u201d Sen. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican,\u00a0told\u00a0UnitedHealth Group CEO Andrew Witty in a Senate hearing this month.\u00a0\u201cAnd how in heaven\u2019s name did you not have the necessary redundancies so that you did not experience this attack and find yourself so vulnerable?\u201d The Justice Department has been pursuing an antitrust investigation into UnitedHealth Group, the Wall Street Journal\u00a0reported\u00a0in February. More broadly, the Justice Department last week\u00a0announced\u00a0a\u00a0task force to examine \u201chealth care monopolies and collusion\u201d that will guide the department\u2019s approach to \u201ccivil and criminal enforcement in health care markets,\u201d where warranted.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/tech/damaging-hacks-expose-the-weak-underbelly-of-americas-health-care-system/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_18_weather_houston-storms-power-severe-weather-south", "text": "As officials assess the damage from destructive storms in the Houston area that killed at least seven people and knocked out power amid rising temperatures, residents in the Southeast and Gulf Coast face a severe weather threat through Saturday that could bring another round of excessive rainfall and severe thunderstorms. A complex of storms with winds up to 100 mph and a tornado left a trail of destruction Thursday across the Houston area that damaged multiple skyscrapers, caused a sewage spill and triggered power outages that could stretch on for weeks amid soaring temperatures. At least four people died from the storm in Houston, including two killed by fallen trees and a third who died in a crane accident, Houston Fire Chief Samuel Pe\u00f1a said Thursday. Another three storm deaths were reported in Harris County on Friday evening. One man collapsed while trying to move a downed electrical pole, and a woman died after lightning struck the trailer she was inside and sparked a fire, Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said in a post on X. Gonzalez said another victim who had lost power reportedly went out to his truck to plug in his oxygen tank and was found unresponsive Friday morning. \u201cHeartbreaking! My condolences go out to the families that lost a loved one during yesterday\u2019s severe weather event,\u201d Gonzalez said. The damaging storms will be followed by high temperatures in the 90s through the weekend and beyond while many are without air conditioning. Over 531,000 customers in Harris County remain without power early Saturday following the line of storms, according to PowerOutage.us. Authorities have warned that restoring power to all customers will be a lengthy process. CenterPoint Energy \u2013 the primary electrical provider in the area \u2013 said the storm system caused \u201cextensive damage to the company\u2019s transmission and distribution electric systems.\u201d Thousands of workers are being deployed to help with restoration efforts, the company said. The rainfall, combined with high winds and power outages, also resulted in the spillage of more than 100,000 gallons of domestic wastewater, otherwise known as sanitary sewage. The spillage occurred in three separate locations across the city, but Houston Public Works assured residents that drinking water from the City of Houston remains safe. With burgeoning heat, the City of Houston opened cooling centers for residents on Friday, officials said in a news release. The heat index, which measures what the body actually feels, could hit triple-digits by next week, raising health risks from weather\u2019s deadliest threat. \u201cThe weather pattern is shifting into a hot and dry pattern starting on Saturday, so it is going to be important to have a way to stay cool,\u201d the National Weather Service warned on Friday. Houston Mayor John Whitmire, who signed a local state of disaster declaration for the city on Friday, toured the downtown area and said the \u201cdevastation is significant.\u201d \u201cWe urge everyone to stay away from the area for your safety and to allow public works personnel to do their vital jobs,\u201d Whitmire said. The weather service classified the line of severe storms that moved through Texas and Louisiana Thursday as a derecho, a potentially destructive weather event characterized by widespread wind damage associated with a long-lived line of thunderstorms. Derechos have consistent wind gusts of 58 mph or greater along a path of at least 400 miles, along with several well-separated wind gusts of greater than 75 mph. The determination was made based on the path\u2019s length and intensity. More flash floods and damaging wind gusts possible Saturday Excessive rainfall and severe thunderstorm chances will persist across parts of the Southeast through Saturday, the National Weather Service said. From the Southeast to the north-central Gulf of Mexico, newly developing thunderstorms will bring the potential for more flash flooding and damaging wind gusts on Saturday, according to the National Weather Service. A slight level 2 of 5 risk of severe thunderstorms has been issued across parts of the Southeast into the Carolinas on Saturday, according to the Storm Prediction Center. \u201cIsolated to scattered severe thunderstorms appear possible across portions of the Southeast and Carolinas on Saturday, and parts of the Upper Midwest,\u201d the center said. \u201cDamaging winds should be the main threat, but occasional severe hail and a tornado or two may also occur.\u201d A slight level 2 of 4 risk of excessive rainfall has also been issued for part of the northern Gulf Coast Saturday due to the threat of flash, urban and riverine flooding, the weather service said. Heavy rain is also forecast to continue into Saturday across the Mid-Atlantic and central Appalachians, where scattered instances of flash flooding could occur. On Sunday, thunderstorms are expected to form over the central High Plains and spread east in the evening. The greatest chances for severe weather are across parts of Nebraska and Kansas, with a slight level 2 of 5 risk of severe thunderstorms issued by the Storm Prediction Center. \u201cLarge hail and damaging gusts will be the main hazards, though a tornado or two also will be possible,\u201d the center said. By the end of the weekend, thunderstorm chances will diminish for most of the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic, the weather service said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/18/weather/houston-storms-power-severe-weather-south/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_americas_new-york-city-chinese-migrants-flushing-intl-latam", "text": " A simple act of walking into a mosque with his wife and two children in New York City is what made the past six months of struggle worth it for Ye Chengxiang \u2013 even if not everyone is celebrating his arrival. \u201cIt\u2019s only been over two months here, but we can feel the spirit of freedom, inclusiveness, and equality,\u201d he said over a bowl of noodles. It was his only day off from working 12-hour shifts at a Chinese restaurant in New York City. The slim former restaurant owner left China last October. The ruling Communist Party\u2019s crackdown on his Hui Muslim ethnic group and growing restrictions on personal life gave his family no choice, he says. \u201cWhen I was in China, I had a pent-up feeling in my heart,\u201d he said of living as a Muslim in China, where his children were banned from entering a mosque. Ye and his wife drained $40,000 of their life savings and illegally crossed the United States\u2019 southern border in December after an exhausting weeks-long journey that saw the family take a hazardous boat journey from Colombia to the edge of the Darien Gap, a mountainous rainforest region that connects South and Central America. His anxieties melted away as Ye crossed into the US, which he described as entering a warm embrace. \u201cI felt like I was home, and that feeling was very real,\u201d he said. Their destination was New York City\u2019s Flushing neighborhood, home to a Chinese community going back generations. The city has integrated\u202fmillions\u202fof migrants over the decades, and it continues to inspire newcomers like Ye \u2013 even as the arrival of such migrants has turned into a flashpoint in US politics ahead of the November elections. After arriving in New York, Ye spent a week in a Manhattan shelter. Then, with the help of a group of other Chinese Muslim\u202fasylum\u202fseekers, he found a place to live and a job making noodles as his family proceeded through the religious\u202fasylum claim process.\u202f Their first court date is in October He is exhausted, barely having time to learn English or explore the new city. But he is happy. The first time that he walked to a mosque in Flushing with his wife and daughters, \u201cI immediately felt that rock, that lump in my heart, dissolve away,\u201d he told CNN. On downtown Flushing\u2019s Main Street, people hand out fliers offering help, for a fee, for the undocumented to secure drivers\u2019 licenses. Alongside the street vendors hawking vegetables, undocumented migrants walk into buildings with employment agencies offering restaurant and sales jobs. This is what draws Chinese migrants toward enclaves like Flushing and Sunset Park, where immigrant networks, legal service centers, job markets and nonprofits form a vital support system. For Chinese\u202fasylum\u202fseekers like Ye, there is a well-trodden route to residency in the US. Chinese nationals have the\u202fhighest\u202fnumber of asylum claims granted\u202f\u00a0in the US compared to other nationalities, because their \u201cpathway to claiming political\u202fasylum\u202f[for Chinese nationals] is more codified,\u201d said Amy Hsin, a sociology professor at Queens College in New York, who specializes in immigration and social inequality.\u00a0 The US expanded\u202fasylum\u202fpathways\u202ffor Chinese citizens in the past due to geopolitical events and policies, like the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre and the one-child policy, she explained. Recently, growing restrictions on freedoms in China and its stuttering economy have led to this new influx of disillusioned Chinese citizens. More than 37,000 Chinese citizens were picked up by law enforcement crossing illegally from Mexico in 2023, US government data shows. That\u2019s up from around 3,800 people the year before, and many of them were headed to New York City, according to experts. In a statement to CNN, China\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that it is on \u201ca human rights development path suited to its national conditions,\u201d emphasizing the country\u2019s stunning economic transformation over the past few decades. \u201cAs a country under the rule of law, the Chinese government protects its people\u2019s freedom of speech and freedom of religious belief in accordance with the law,\u201d it also said. \u2018America is better\u2019 On the fourth floor of an old mall, migrant workers walk into a legal service center. They say they have lost their passports, or had them confiscated, in the melee of voluntarily turning themselves in for\u202fasylum\u202fwith the Customs and Border Protection. The office, which helps them in their\u202fasylum\u202fapplications, also connects them with the Chinese Embassy to apply for new travel documents. In the waiting room, migrants told CNN how videos on social media, providing detailed instructions on how to cross Central America to the US, inspired them to make the journey. They spoke of the socio-economic pressures back in China, made worse by pandemic restrictions and its lack of economic rebound, forcing them to leave the country. The center\u2019s owner, who declined to be named in this story because he does not have a license to practice law in the US, has helped more than 100 Chinese nationals since opening the office two years ago. The burden of proof for\u202fasylum\u202fclaims in the US is high and the owner said many of his clients have struggled to provide concrete evidence of political and religious repression they faced in China. Many go on to protest against the Chinese government once in the US, freed from Chinese authorities and its censors, he said. Dressed simply in jeans and a black jacket, Jiang Zhen said the\u202fsweeping crackdown\u202fon free speech, civil society and religion was suffocating him in China. He believes he was blacklisted for criticizing China\u2019s government on social media sites, his accounts banned or suspended. Poverty in rural China, like in his hometown in Hunan province, had become unbearable, with relatives and parents of friends \u201cdrinking pesticides, drowning themselves in rivers, or hanging themselves \u2026 especially when they are suffering from diseases like cancer and have no money for treatment,\u201d he said, adding that the Chinese government ignores \u201cthe living conditions of the lower classes.\u201d As he waits for his work permit, which can take up to 18 months to approve, the 33-year-old now works illegally cleaning dishes at a Cantonese restaurant in Queens. He earns $4,000 a month, slightly more than what he earned as a business owner in the coastal Chinese province of Guangdong. Next to him, a woman in a pearl-colored puffer jacket, who asked to remain anonymous because she works illegally in the country, said the US was not what she had imagined. She joked that China\u2019s infrastructure bests what she has seen in New York. \u201cFrom movies I watched when I was younger, I remembered Chinatowns being bustling and beautiful,\u201d she said. \u201cBut after coming here, I found that Chinatown is in a state of\u202f\u200b\u200bdisrepair. It\u2019s broken and dirty. I was so surprised,\u201d she said as the room burst out in laughter. When asked why she has chosen to remain in the US, she replied: \u201cBecause the US is actually more powerful, despite sometimes the broken appearance,\u201d she said. \u201cI am not starving in China, but everyone wants a better life. Obviously, America is better.\u201d Anti-China measures Both China and US authorities have been concerned with the uptick in migration to the southern border \u2013 but for entirely different reasons. A Chinese government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to comment publicly, told CNN that they believed some new Chinese migrants are participating in violent anti-China demonstrations in the US to help with their asylum cases.\u00a0The official pointed to clashes between anti-China protesters and pro-China supporters in San Francisco in November, when Chinese leader Xi Jinping was attending a forum in the city. In the US, a\u202frecord number\u202fof migrants at the southern border has been seized upon by Republicans who claim it as proof of the Biden administration\u2019s impotence, pushing immigration control to a top election issue. While most migrants at the southern border hail from Latin American countries, some politicians have focused on Chinese migration as a security concern; Republican Rep. Mark Green of Tennessee, who chairs the House Homeland Security Committee, claimed last May that some Chinese migrants at the border had military experience,\u202faccording to his blog, though he did not offer evidence. Wan Yanhai, a human rights activist based in New York, said the implication that the Chinese\u202fasylum\u202fseekers could be soldiers or spies was \u201cdiscriminatory.\u201d There would be little reason for the Chinese government to embed spies among southern border arrivals, he pointed out, considering migrants are not the demographic that would gain access to state secrets in the US. \u201cThese migrants in the US are doing low-level jobs and don\u2019t speak the language, so they can\u2019t do this kind of work. \u2026 It\u2019s impossible for them to be spies.\u201d But the rhetoric around the rise of undocumented Chinese migrants highlights growing tensions between the US and Chinese governments. Geopolitical and security concerns\u202fhave led an increasingly hawkish Biden administration\u202fto unravel years of technological and economic integration with its chief rival in the Pacific. But Jiang, the\u202fasylum\u202fseeker who believes he was blacklisted by Beijing, is unfazed by the growing intergovernmental tensions. \u201cIt\u2019s not really anti-China, it\u2019s anti-Communist Party. I\u2019m also against the Communist Party, I don\u2019t have a good impression of them either, right?\u201d \u2018Deportation can\u2019t stop me from embracing freedom\u2019 Wan, a prominent former\u202fHIV activist in China, had to leave the country in 2010 due to harassment by Chinese authorities, he says. He received permanent US residence a year later and has gone on to help Chinese migrants in Flushing. Many of the new arrivals head to the enclave\u2019s unlicensed hostels, he said. He worries that rising hostel prices \u2013 upwards of $20 per night \u2013 could lead to a rise in homelessness, especially for the low-income elderly population in Flushing. Li Jiada lives in one of those hostels, sharing a cramped room with five other men, sparsely decorated except for a calendar hanging above his single bed. Life has not been easy for the 26-year-old, soft-spoken former fashion photographer since he arrived in the US on January 2023. He had spent three months in an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention center after failing an initial screening for\u202fasylum\u202fwhen he crossed the southern border. He was released this year pending deportation proceedings expected within the next year. He initially struggled to find a job in New York. When he found one, he says, he was sexually harassed by a client and has since found a new role as a manicurist, earning $2,000 a month. His costs are higher than what he earns, but he says, \u201cThere\u2019s no regret because coming here has given me more options.\u201d He is desperate to stay in the US and thinks Christianity, which he discovered while in detention, will save him from deportation. The Communist Party\u202fsees any large\u202fgroup outside its dominion as a threat, has banned the online sale of Bibles, and has arrested Christians for \u201cinciting subversion of state power.\u201d \u201cMaybe my only way forward is through Jesus,\u201d he said. Li plans on filing a new\u202fasylum\u202fapplication based on his new-found religion. Sitting in a Baptist church in Flushing, Li spoke about the stress of the looming deportation and thinks back about the first thing he did when he arrived in New York: seeing the Statue of Liberty, a sculpture that has become a symbol of hope for millions of immigrants before him. \u201cAfter the treacherous journey to get here, I needed to see the embodiment of my beliefs: democracy, freedom, equality, and rule of law,\u201d he said. \u201cThe US has yet to accept me, but deportation can\u2019t stop me from embracing freedom.\u201d The ethnic enclave has largely shielded the migrants CNN spoke to from a recent\u202frise\u202fin anti-Asian crimes in the city. Still, Li thinks he may have been targeted for being Chinese: Someone threw a full can of soda at him as he waited for a train back to Flushing from Manhattan, he said. And like a true New Yorker, he gave the assailant a piece of his mind. \u201cAt that moment, I felt like I could suddenly speak English fluently,\u201d he joked. \u201cMy talent was unleashed, and I said: \u201cWhat the f**k?\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/americas/new-york-city-chinese-migrants-flushing-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_middleeast_israel-gaza-yoav-gallant-intl-latam", "text": "Israel\u2019s Defense Minister Yoav Gallant has called on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u00a0to publicly rule out Israeli governance over Gaza and to lay out his\u00a0post-war plans, warning that he opposes Israeli rule in the Palestinian enclave. \u201cThe \u2018day after Hamas,\u2019 will only be achieved with Palestinian entities taking control of Gaza, accompanied by international actors, establishing a governing alternative to Hamas\u2019 rule,\u201d Gallant said during a news conference at the Kirya, Israel\u2019s military headquarters Wednesday. \u201c\u2060I call on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to make a decision and declare that Israel will not establish civilian control over the Gaza Strip, that Israel will not establish military governance in the Gaza Strip, and that a governing alternative to Hamas in the Gaza Strip will be raised immediately,\u201d he added. Gallant\u2019s remarks come as serious questions about Israel\u2019s long-term strategy in Gaza are being raised both inside and outside of Israel after the Israeli military sent troops back into areas of northern Gaza it had withdrawn from months ago to battle Hamas militants who had returned amid a power vacuum. Israeli military officials have quietly warned that the lack of a long-term strategy for post-war governance will result in this pattern repeating throughout Gaza. And top US officials are doing so publicly, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken warning Wednesday that Israel must \u201cfocus on what the future can and must be\u201d to avoid \u201canarchy and a vacuum that\u2019s likely to be filled by chaos.\u201d Gallant has previously said he opposes Israeli control over post-war Gaza, but his remarks Wednesday were his most direct on the topic as he warned of the consequences of a long-term Israeli military presence in Gaza and called out Netanyahu directly. \u201cI will not agree to the establishment of Israeli military rule in Gaza. Israel must not establish civilian rule in Gaza,\u201d he said, warning that a military occupation of the Palestinian territory would take a heavy toll in \u201cbloodshed and victims, as well as a heavy economic price,\u201d he warned. Netanyahu appeared to respond to Gallant\u2019s remarks later on Wednesday, saying in a video statement posted to social media that neither Hamas nor the Palestinian Authority would be acceptable entities to govern Gaza. \u201cI\u2019m not willing to replace Hamastan with Fatahstan,\u201d he said, referring to Fatah, the Palestinian political party that dominates the Palestinian Authority. Netanyahu also said that a complete routing of Hamas would be his prerequisite for a new civilian government in Gaza.\u00a0\u201cAs long as Hamas remains in place, no other entity would enter Gaza to administer the civilian aspects, especially not the Palestinian Authority,\u201d he said. Gallant\u2019s remarks set off a political firestorm in Israel, with a number of right-wing lawmakers condemning\u00a0Gallant\u2019s statement and some even urging Netanyahu to remove him from his position. War cabinet member Minister Benny Gantz meanwhile has endorsed Gallant\u2019s stance, saying he was \u201cspeaking the truth\u201d. The public clash between Gallant and Netanyahu follows repeated calls by the US for Israel to produce a clear plan for post-war Gaza. \u201cWe do not support and will not support an Israeli occupation. We also of course, do not support Hamas governance in Gaza,\u201d US Secretary of State Antony\u00a0Blinken\u00a0told journalists at press conference\u00a0in\u00a0Kyiv, Ukraine, on Wednesday, adding, \u201cWe also can\u2019t have anarchy and a vacuum that\u2019s likely to be filled by chaos.\u201d \u201cThere needs to be a clear and concrete plan, and we look to Israel to come forward with\u00a0its\u00a0ideas,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/middleeast/israel-gaza-yoav-gallant-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_17_style_mona-lisa-setting-italian-town-claim", "text": "Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s Mona Lisa \u2014 one of the most famous paintings in the world \u2014 is shrouded in mystery; from questions around the figures identity, to her puzzling, enigmatic expression. Now, at least one of the artwork\u2019s secrets has been revealed, according to a geologist based in Italy. Ann Pizzorusso, who is both a geologist and an art historian specializing in Leonardo and the Renaissance era, believes she has deduced the location of the Mona Lisa using her geological expertise. Three decades ago, Pizzorusso visited the town of Lecco on the southeastern shore of Lake Como in Italy \u2014 where she believes the painting is set \u2014\u00a0to retrace Leonardo\u2019s steps, armed with diary entries and drawings from the artist. \u201cIn his notebook he mentions being in Lecco,\u201d she told CNN in a phone interview. \u201cHe was working as an engineer.\u201d According to Pizzorusso, the project Leonardo was working on was canceled, but his geological field sketches remained (one red chalk drawing of a mountain range near Lecco belongs to the Royal Collection at Windsor, London). While Pizzorusso is not the first to have theorized on the location of the Mona Lisa (in 2011, an art historian attributed the painting\u2019s scenery to a small town called Bobbio, while another to Arezzo) she believes she is the first geologist. Previous calculations have concentrated on the arched bridge over the Mona Lisa\u2019s right shoulder. However, Pizzorusso insists more can be gleaned from the unique rock formation in the horizon. \u201cBridges are fungible,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you look in the background, you\u2019ll see pinnacles. It\u2019s a type of erosion that happens in limestone that has fractures in it and breaks off in blocks, almost like a sawtooth pattern\u2026 We can show limestone exists in (Lecco). When you look at the Mona Lisa, there\u2019s a series of mountains in the background that have this sawtooth pattern.\u201d Similarly, the body of water behind Mona Lisa is geologically specific, believed by Pizzorusso to be Lake Como \u2014 a subalpine glacial lake dating back around 10,000 years. \u201cIf you look behind her you have the elongated glacial lakes that have a particular form like fingers,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause when the glacier moved it scoured out certain pieces of land.\u201d Despite her confidence, Pizzorusso kept her inkling quiet for 30 years, telling only other Leonardo scholars in casual conversation. She returned to Lecco this week, still assured that \u201ceverything added up,\u201d and will now present her findings at a geology conference in the town. While the pairing of earth science and art history may seem disparate, Pizzorusso argues the interdisciplinary approach can enrich the viewing experience of Leonardo\u2019s work. \u201cBotticelli, even Michelangelo did terrible backgrounds because they felt the figures were more important,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cIf the background is painted right, it gives you more of an appreciation for nature.\u201d Though Pizzorusso admits she is surprised at the widespread interest. \u201cMaybe (Leonardo) was trying to channel me for the environmental movement or something,\u201d she joked. \u201cIt\u2019s a testament to how much people love this painting.\u201d But the discovery may only lead to more mystery. If the location is Lecco, as Pizzorusso suggests, more questions remain as to why the renowned painter chose that particular spot, for this particular portrait. \u201cWe don\u2019t know who (Mona Lisa) is, some believe she was a rich Tuscan merchant\u2019s wife,\u201d she said, referring to a popular historical theory that proposes the figure was based on Italian noblewoman Lisa Gherardini. \u201cWhy did he put her in this wild, untamed environment? This is not Tuscany. What was he trying to tell us by putting this serene, enigmatic lady in this rugged, alpine environment?\u201d Said Pizzorusso. \u201cI\u2019m really intrigued as to what his message was to us.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/style/mona-lisa-setting-italian-town-claim/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_14_europe_georgia-foreign-agents-bill-passed-intl", "text": "Georgia\u2019s parliament has passed a controversial \u201cforeign agents\u201d bill despite widespread domestic opposition and warnings from the European Union that its enactment would imperil the country\u2019s chances of joining the bloc. The new law will require organizations receiving more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as \u201cagents of foreign influence\u201d or face crippling fines. Opponents say that the legislation was modeled after similar laws in Russia that the Kremlin has used to increasingly snuff out opposition and civil society. The law was approved on Tuesday by 84 lawmakers voting in favor to 30 against. After the vote, riot police moved on protesters in Tbilisi after some individuals smashed down the barriers and broke into the grounds of the parliament. Many Georgians fear their foreign agents bill will be used the same way in their country. Georgia\u2019s parliament now has 10 days to send the bill to President Salome Zourabichvili, who has already vowed to veto it. Zourabichvili has two weeks to do so, but parliament can override her objection with a simple majority. The bill has become a cultural flashpoint in a country which, like Ukraine, finds itself caught between Russia and Europe. Polls show that an estimated 80% of Georgians want to join the EU, but Moscow\u2019s geopolitical orbit has proven tough to exit. Speaking to CNN\u2019s Christiane Amanpour, Zourabichvili said the upcoming elections in October will give the population a chance to \u201creverse\u201d the bill. \u201cWe have to use this mobilization of the society and this consolidation of the political parties to go and win those elections because that\u2019s the European way,\u201d she said. Georgia applied for membership of the bloc in 2022 and was granted candidate status in December, a move seen as an effort to reverse the former Soviet republic\u2019s drift toward Russia. However, EU leaders have made it clear that the foreign agents bill\u2019s passage would jeopardize Georgia\u2019s chances of accession. The United States also voiced concerns about the bill and \u201cdemocratic backsliding\u201d in the country, which is nestled in the Caucasus Mountains, bordered by Russia to the north and Turkey, Armenia and Azerbaijan to the south. Georgian Dream, the ruling party that pushed through the legislation, has hit back at criticism, saying the move will promote transparency and national sovereignty. But the party has long been suspected of harboring pro-Russian sympathies, especially given that its founder, the billionaire former Prime Minister Bidzina\u00a0Ivanishvili, made his fortune in the Soviet Union. President Zourabichvili called the legislation a \u201cRussian law,\u201d adding that Georgians are \u201cvery well aware of these old Russian Soviet propaganda tricks, so it doesn\u2019t work. They see what\u2019s happening and they\u2019re going to stop it from happening.\u201d The movement of the bill has ignited a feverish response, including in parliament, where scuffles and shouting matches broke out during the hours-long debate that preceded the law\u2019s passage on Tuesday. Masked officers engaged with the crowds shortly afterwards, as riot police appear to be preparing to disperse the protesters. Similar scenes played out last month when an opposition lawmaker punched a key Georgian Dream member in the face,\u00a0sparking a wider brawl. Many anti-Russian, pro-European Georgians remain angry over Russia\u2019s invasion in 2008 and the fact that the Kremlin still occupies about 20% of Georgia\u2019s internationally recognized territory \u2013 about the same proportion that Russia occupies in Ukraine. Nightly protests have been shutting down the capital, Tbilisi, for about a month. About 50,000 people\u00a0came out Sunday evening in the city of 1 million people to speak out against what they\u2019ve dubbed \u201cthe Russian law.\u201d \u201cIt is a Russian law. It is an exact duplicate of the Putin law that was adopted a few years ago and then complemented in order to crush civil society,\u201d Zourabichvili, the Georgian president and a longstanding opponent of Georgian Dream, told CNN in an interview. Zourabichvili told CNN she would veto the law, but the country\u2019s parliament can override that with a simple majority. Levan\u00a0Khabeishvili, a protester who was seriously hurt after being beaten by police, told CNN that the law is yet another example of Moscow trying to assert its authority in the region. CNN has reached out to authorities for more information on why police used excessive force against him. \u201cWe know that this law is dangerous for our future. It threatens our partnership with the West,\u201d Khabeishvili said. The Kremlin has claimed that the law was being used to \u201cprovoke anti-Russian sentiments.\u201d Dmitry Peskov, Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s spokesman, said on Tuesday that criticism of the bill was tantamount to \u201cundisguised interference in Georgia\u2019s internal affairs.\u201d Current Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze\u2019s office declined an interview request from CNN. CNN\u2019s Christian Edwards, Anna Chernova  and Vasco Cotovio contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/europe/georgia-foreign-agents-bill-passed-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_17_americas_dominican-republic-election-explainer-intl-latam", "text": "The Dominican Republic is days away from\u00a0a general election that will see voters elect new lawmakers and the president\u00a0as they weigh the nation\u2019s economy and security. Among those seeking the Caribbean nation\u2019s highest office\u00a0on May 19\u00a0are the current president, a former president, and a mayor. If no presidential candidate receives over 50% of the vote, a second round will be held on June 30. Here\u2019s a look at the candidates and issues: President Luis Abinader promises \u2018the change continues\u2019 The Dominican Republic\u2019s current president, Luis Abinader, is seeking re-election for a second term that would keep him in office until 2028.\u00a0The 56-year-old\u00a0economist and businessman first assumed the presidency in 2020, in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic \u2013 following in the footsteps of his senator father, a three-time presidential candidate. Leading the ballot of the Modern Revolutionary Party (PRM) with his slogan \u201cThe change continues,\u201d\u00a0the popular leader\u00a0is now\u00a0promising four more years of economic growth and stability.\u00a0During his\u00a0first\u00a0term\u00a0from\u00a02020\u00a0to\u00a02024, the\u00a0Dominican Republic\u00a0established a new record\u00a0in the tourism industry,\u00a0with more than 10 million tourists visiting the island in\u00a02023. Experts now expect Abinader to focus on the priorities of his first term, expanding on development, reform, and the fight against corruption. He has promised reforms for the National Police, health sector, and education. Abinader\u2019s\u00a0government\u00a0has shown a commitment to addressing long-standing challenges\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0energy\u00a0sector.\u00a0But the World Bank says\u00a0the Dominican Republic\u00a0has more work to do\u00a0in\u00a0increasing transparency, accountability, and efficiency in the sector; continuing with the diversification of\u00a0the energy matrix among others. \u201cAbinader has a first rate and well-coordinated economic team,\u201d says economist and former\u00a0Dominican\u00a0ambassador to the US, Bernardo Vega.\u00a0But\u00a0Vega\u00a0notes that\u00a0increased\u00a0losses in the electric distribution system\u00a0\u2013\u00a0and\u00a0a resulting\u00a0increase in\u00a0external\u00a0debt\u00a0\u2013\u00a0have not\u00a0reflected well on his administration. Abinader\u2019s handling of\u00a0a spiraling\u00a0political and social crisis\u00a0in\u00a0neighboring Haiti\u00a0has also had mixed reviews.\u00a0For\u00a0voters living close to the border, the question of whether measures like deportations and closing the country\u2019s border to Haiti have been effective in insulating the Dominican Republic from shocks in Port-au-Prince will be top of mind, according to political analyst Rosario Espinal. During his\u00a02020\u00a0campaign run,\u00a0Abinader\u00a0promised to fight corruption, and later appointed what he described as\u00a0the\u00a0country\u2019s\u00a0\u201cfirst independent\u201d\u00a0\u00a0attorney\u00a0general. \u00a0Critics\u00a0argue that his administration\u2019s anti-corruption push\u00a0focused\u00a0disproportionately on members of the Dominican Liberation Party,\u00a0which held power for many years\u00a0before Abinader\u2019s election. Nevertheless, experts say the crackdown on corruption, along with his handling of the pandemic, are widely seen as achievements. Former President Leonel Fern\u00e1ndez seeks re-election \u2013 for the fourth time A familiar face to voters will be Leonel Fern\u00e1ndez, 70, who has already held the Dominican presidency three times: from 1996 to 2000, from 2004 to 2008 and from 2008 to 2012. Fernandez is most known\u00a0modernizing the Dominican Republic\u2019s\u00a0state institutions and justice system, including the constitutional reform that led to the 2010 Constitution, according to experts. One of his major contributions was during his first term when Fernandez privatized the energy distribution sector and\u00a0sold shares to private investors in the\u00a0electricity\u00a0companies that until then\u00a0had been\u00a0owned by the government,\u00a0according to\u00a0Vega. The ex-president is also recognized\u00a0in the Dominican Republic\u00a0for\u00a0advancing and building national\u00a0infrastructure,\u00a0such as\u00a0the subway system\u00a0that\u00a0transformed the capital city of Santo Domingo.\u00a0As a result,\u00a0Fernandez\u2019s presidencies\u00a0had\u00a0a\u00a0major impact on tourism in the eastern region, experts\u00a0say. But many voters will also likely remember that government corruption ran high during\u00a0his 12 years as head of state, Vega\u00a0says. Today,\u00a0Fernandez\u00a0heads the ticket of the\u00a0Force of the People\u00a0party, which he founded in November 2019 after losing the party primaries of his former party, the Dominican Liberation Party. Recently, Fernandez has promised to push forth public policies aimed at reducing poverty, the construction of decent homes, better education, comprehensive health, and citizen security, among others. His\u00a0platform has focused on inequality in the country, with \u201ccalls for wealth redistribution and social justice,\u201d according to Americas Quarterly. The five-time presidential candidate has also reportedly said he would back a new United Nations peacekeeping mission to Haiti. Abel Mart\u00ednez: From prosecutor, deputy, mayor to trying to win the presidency Abel Mart\u00ednez, 51, is a Dominican politician, educator and lawyer with a wide-spanning career in public service. Most recently the mayor of Santiago until last month, Martinez got his start as deputy prosecutor in capital city Santo Domingo, and then as a prosecutor in Santiago in the 1990s. He later became a deputy to the country\u2019s National Congress, serving three terms from 2002 to 2016 and presiding over the Chamber of Deputies for six years. Martinez is focused on heightening tech across multiple sectors, per Americas Quarterly,\u00a0as well as strengthening\u00a0the country\u2019s prison system and surveillance at the border with Haiti. Martinez is focused on ending hunger and poverty, better education for students and teachers, and fighting\u00a0crime and citizen safety. The youngest candidate running for president\u00a0also campaigns\u00a0against illegal immigration, especially of Haitians. Crime and safety and inflation on the ballot Crime and safety are among the biggest concerns of Dominicans\u00a0in this election, according to several surveys, although government data indicates that crime has decreased in the first quarter of this year compared to the same period in 2023, with\u00a0the\u00a0homicide\u00a0rate falling by 30.2%. Since June 2023, the US State Department\u00a0has\u00a0maintained\u00a0a\u00a0Level 2 travel advisory for\u00a0the\u00a0Dominican Republic and recommends tourists exercise increased caution\u00a0due to crime. Pablo Flores resides in Santo Domingo and has his own business, a mini market. At one point, rampant crime forced him to temporarily shutter the business, he recalls. Today, for fear of being robbed, he has taken his own precautions; a fence protects the entire perimeter of his small business. \u201cIf I don\u2019t take care of myself, who is going to take care of me? Crime must go down because it\u2019s very high,\u201d says Flores. Hand-in-hand with street crime are the Dominican Republic\u2019s economic woes. According to\u00a0the World Bank, over the last two decades, the Dominican Republic has been one of the fastest-growing economies in Caribbean. Yet the drivers of this exceptional growth\u00a0appear to be\u00a0reaching their limit due to low productivity growth in recent years, insufficient human capital to meet the needs of the business sector, climate change-related disasters, and distortions in key markets, including the inefficient allocation of tax exemptions,\u00a0according to\u00a0the World Bank. And while the\u00a0Dominican economy grew by 4.9% last year,\u00a0high inflation rates in\u00a0both\u00a02022\u00a0(8.8%)\u00a0and 2023 (4.8%)\u00a0have taken a toll on the population\u2019s quality of life. Yoely Escarlante, a mechanic, says he is struggling to support his four children, and keeps his small workshop in Santo Domingo open rain or shine. There are days when he can earn up to $100 (between 5,000 and 6,000 Dominican pesos) in a day, according to his calculations. But some days, he doesn\u2019t earn a dime, he says. The economic situation is also of great concern for Ney Segura, a public transportation driver. \u201cThe money just doesn\u2019t cut it,\u201d\u00a0he\u00a0says. In his view, \u201cthe poor are poorer.\u201d More than 40% of Dominicans are economically vulnerable and are at risk of falling into poverty due to climate-related impacts and economic crises, according to the World Bank. Likewise, gender gaps in jobs and wages, shorter working lives, and higher unemployment and unpaid roles contribute to increased poverty among women in particular, it says.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/americas/dominican-republic-election-explainer-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "world"}}
