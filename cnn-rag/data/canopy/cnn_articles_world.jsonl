{"id": "2024_06_03_style_franz-kafka-letter-writers-block-auction-intl-scli", "text": "A letter giving a rare insight into Franz Kafka\u2019s struggle with writer\u2019s block is going up for auction. Best-known for the 1915 novella \u201cThe Metamorphosis,\u201d the Prague-born Jewish writer struggled throughout his short life with anxiety, hopelessness and isolation \u2013 themes that came to define his work \u2013 but little has been known about his creative process. The one-page letter, which is expected to sell for \u00a370,000 to \u00a390,000 ($89,000 to $115,000) at Sotheby\u2019s in London, is dated to spring 1920, according to the auction house. This means it would have been written while Kafka was undergoing treatment for tuberculosis, with which he was diagnosed three years earlier. He took intermittent sick leave from his job with an insurance company and would often spend periods at sanatoriums. He retired in 1922 and died in a clinic near Vienna two years later. \u201cI haven\u2019t written anything for three years, what\u2019s published now are old things, I don\u2019t have any other work, not even started,\u201d Kafka lamented in the letter, written in German and addressed to his friend, the Austrian poet Albert Ehrenstein. Giving a reason for this literary dry spell, Kafka wrote: \u201cWhen worries have penetrated to a certain layer of inner existence, writing and complaining obviously cease, indeed my resistance was not too strong.\u201d The letter was written in response to Ehrenstein asking him to contribute to his magazine, Sotheby\u2019s said in a media statement issued Monday. Ehrenstein made the request after seeing a newly published work by Kafka \u2013 probably the 1919 short story collection \u201cEin Landarzt\u201d (\u201cA Country Doctor\u201d). \u201cThe life and works of Franz Kafka have long been a source of fascination throughout the world,\u201d Sotheby\u2019s Books & Manuscripts specialist Gabriel Heaton said in the release. \u201cThe letter reveals how writing made intense demands on him, and required deep reserves of inner strength, as he grappled with deep insecurity and worry about the futility of his work. We can also all be thankful that Kafka would continue to pick up his pen despite his crippling writer\u2019s block,\u201d he added. At the time the letter was written, Kafka had also begun an intense love affair with Czech journalist and writer Milena Jesensk\u00e1. So, despite his physical health continuing to decline, Kafka was given renewed confidence with Jesensk\u00e1\u2019s support and was able to begin his final literary endeavors, including \u201cA Hunger Artist\u201d and \u201cThe Castle,\u201d according to the release. Both these books were published posthumously, in 1924 and 1926, respectively \u2013 despite Kafka requesting that his unpublished manuscripts be destroyed upon his death. Though he was sought out by avant-garde publishers during his life, Kafka\u2019s greatest literary acclaim came posthumously. His works, all written in German, were rediscovered in Germany and Austria after 1945, and he began to have a huge influence on German literature that extended globally by the 1960s. They have been widely adapted for the cinema, TV and theater. The auction will run from June 26 to July 10.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/style/franz-kafka-letter-writers-block-auction-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_30_tech_elon-musk-byd-china-nightcap", "text": "The most important carmaker in the world right now is the Chinese-owned, Warren Buffett-backed company that has Elon Musk in a pickle. BYD, a carmaker Musk once laughed at, overtook Tesla at the end of last year as the top seller of electric vehicles on the planet (Tesla overtook it in the first quarter of this year, but they\u2019re neck and neck). And now it\u2019s giving Toyota a run for its money, unveiling a new hybrid powertrain that BYD says is capable of taking you from New York to Miami without refueling. That\u2019s 1,300 miles in one go \u2014 hundreds of miles beyond the standard ranges for other hybrids on the market. According to The Wall Street Journal, ranges of major global hybrid carmakers typically top out just above 680 miles. BYD\u2019s Hong Kong shares shot up more than 5% on Wednesday. There are a few reasons why all of that matters. One: Tesla is America\u2019s best-selling EV, but it\u2019s losing market share overseas to foreign competitors that can make their cars cheaper. And while Tesla is an EV pioneer, it hasn\u2019t rolled out any significant innovations in recent years that would help justify its loftier price point. That\u2019s why BYD \u2014 which makes both EVs and hybrids \u2014 is now eating Tesla\u2019s lunch on the global stage. China is the world\u2019s biggest auto market, and BYD is its top seller, surpassing Volkswagen last year. On top of all that, BYD\u2019s sedans are cheap. The two models that will boast the new drivetrain start at around $14,000. (For comparison, the best-selling hybrid in the US, the Toyota Prius, starts at $28,000.) BYD\u2019s evolution from a small producer of clunkers to a global powerhouse brand has surprised its skeptics, including Musk, who roundly dismissed BYD in a 2011 Bloomberg interview. In that exchange, Musk responds to an honest question about BYD rivaling Tesla with a smug laugh. \u201cHave you seen their car?\u201d he asks the interviewer rhetorically. When the reporter presses him, he clarifies that he thinks BYD\u2019s product is not \u201cparticularly attractive\u201d and that the technology is \u201cnot very strong.\u201d Of course, a lot happened in the decade that followed, and Musk ate his words this January, saying on an earnings call that he believes Chinese EV makers could \u201cpretty much demolish most other car companies in the world\u201d unless stronger trade barriers are put in place. (They were two weeks ago.) Meanwhile, BYD has another edge that Tesla lacks: It makes hybrids. Hybrid cars like the Prius were supposed to be the short-lived stepping stone to our all-electric future. But in the United States, at least, EV sales are flagging in part because the nation\u2019s roads lack the infrastructure to support them. EV ranges have come a long way \u2014 most get more than 300 miles of range per charge, which is more than most people would drive before stopping even in a traditional car. Problem is, we don\u2019t have enough charging stations along the roads or within cities to make customers comfortable with the idea. The top reason US customers won\u2019t consider an EV \u2014 cited by 52% of consumers in a recent JD Power survey \u2014 is lack of charging station availability. Instead, we\u2019re buying more hybrids, which are largely cheaper than EVs, reduce the cost of fuel over the long term and are ever so slightly better for the environment than regular engines. (Emphasis on slightly\u2026 Hybrids still run on fossil fuels, they\u2019re not doing much to help the world meet its climate goals the way mass adoption of EVs would.) For now, Tesla and other US carmakers are being thoroughly shielded from Chinese competition via strict tariffs and major regulatory hurdles. But it\u2019s not clear how long those protections will hold if American consumers begin demanding the cheaper options available overseas.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/tech/elon-musk-byd-china-nightcap/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_02_europe_zelensky-ukraine-shangrila-address-intl-hnk", "text": "China\u2019s support to Russia will extend the war in Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky said Sunday, as he called on countries across the Asia-Pacific to join an upcoming peace summit he accused Russia of trying to thwart. Zelensky made the comments in Singapore during a surprise appearance at a meeting of defense chiefs from across the Asia-Pacific, including China and the US. It comes ahead of\u00a0the international peace\u00a0conference on Ukraine slated to be held June 15-16 in Switzerland. \u201cWith China\u2019s support to Russia the war will last longer. That is bad for the whole world, and the policy of China \u2013 who declares that it supports territorial integrity and sovereignty and declares it officially. For them it is not good,\u201d Zelensky said during a press conference. China claims neutrality in the conflict and has said it is a proponent of peace, even as it has emerged as a key economic lifeline and tightened its already close strategic and diplomatic partnership with Russia since the country\u2019s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The US has also alleged that China\u2019s export of dual-use goods to Russia is powering the warring country\u2019s defense industrial base and warned Beijing of consequences for such support \u2013 a claim Beijing has refuted, saying it has not provided weapons to either side and maintains tight export controls on dual use goods. Zelensky alluded to such support in comments Sunday, saying certain elements that make up parts of Russia\u2019s weaponry \u201ccome from China.\u201d The Ukrainian leader\u00a0also warned that Russia was attempting to pressure countries not to join the upcoming international peace summit \u2013 with China\u2019s help. \u201cRussia is trying to disrupt the peace summit and that is true \u2026 (Russia) is now traveling around many countries in the world threatening them with the blockade of the agricultural goods, of the food products, of chemical products \u2026 it is simply pushing the other countries of the world so that they\u2019re not present on the summit,\u201d Zelensky said after delivering an address at the defense conference. When asked later about China\u2019s statement it would not attend the peace summit, the Ukrainian leader accused Russia of using Chinese diplomats to disrupt it. \u201cRegrettably, it is unfortunate that such big independent powerful country as China is an instrument in the hands of Putin,\u201d Zelensky said, speaking through an interpreter. The Ukrainian leader added that he had not had any meetings with Chinese representatives in Singapore, despite interest on the Ukrainian side for more dialogue. China last week said it would not send a delegation to the peace summit, saying any international peace conference should have \u201crecognition by both Russia and Ukraine, equal participation by all parties, and fair discussion of all peace plans.\u201d Chinese Minister of National Defense Dong Jun in an address earlier Sunday said China had been \u201cpromoting peace talks with a responsible attitude.\u201d  Dong also appeared to respond to US allegations that China is bolstering Russia\u2019s defense industrial base with dual-use exports, saying in his remarks\u00a0that China has not provided weapons to either side in the conflict and had put \u201cstricter control\u201d on dual-use exports. US defense chief Lloyd Austin raised those transactions with Dong during a sideline meeting Friday, where he warned of consequences for any Chinese support of Russia\u2019s military. When asked about Zelensky\u2019s comments dur\ufeffing a regular press briefing in Beijing Monday, a spokesperson for China\u2019s Foreign Ministry defended China\u2019s trade with Russia as \u201cabove board,\u201d adding it was \u201ccertainly not against the peace summit\u201d and there was \u201cno pressure on other countries.\u201d \u201cWe also attach great importance to our relations with Ukraine \u2026 China and Ukraine have maintained communication and cooperation since the Ukrainian crisis escalated,\u201d spokesperson Mao Ning said. \u2018Time is running out\u2019 The Ukrainian leader\u2019s in-person appeal at the Shangri-La Dialogue comes as Ukraine\u2019s troops scramble to repel a major Russian advance into its northeast region of Kharkiv amid shortages of weaponry and manpower more than two years into Russia\u2019s invasion \u2013 raising the urgency for Kyiv to bolster international support for its peace plan. Zelensky\u2019s plan\u00a0calls for the full withdrawal of Russian forces and a restoration of Ukraine\u2019s internationally recognized borders. The Ukrainian leader has previously said he won\u2019t negotiate with Russia until its forces withdraw. \u201cTime is running out\u201d including for Ukrainian children taken by Russia, Zelensky told a packed hall during an address on the closing day of the three-day security meeting. The summit, he said, would address three points of his peace formula, including \u201cnuclear security, food security, and the release of prisoners of war,\u201d as well as \u201cUkrainian children abducted by Russia\u201d and enable countries to come to a consensus on peace in Ukraine that could be \u201cpassed to Russia.\u201d The International Criminal Court in The Hague last year\u00a0issued an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin for an alleged scheme to deport Ukrainian children to Russia. Russia has referred to the peace conference as \u201ctrickery\u201d designed by the United States, with a Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson last week saying the \u201creal \u2018peace formula\u2019\u201d was for Western countries to stop providing Ukraine with weaponry. So far more than 100 countries and international organizations have committed to join the gathering, Zelensky said. The upcoming peace summit and Ukraine\u2019s defense were also key topics for Zelensky as he held sideline meetings since arriving in Singapore on Saturday. Those included talks with US Defense Secretary Austin, Indonesia\u2019s President-Elect Prabowo Subianto, and Timor-Leste\u2019s President Jos\u00e9 Ramos-Horta, as well as a delegation of American lawmakers. In his meeting with Zelensky Sunday morning, Austin reiterated \u201cunwavering US support for Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression\u201d and provided an update on American security assistance to Ukraine, according to a readout from Pentagon press secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder after the meeting. Zelensky said in a post on Twitter that the two sides discussed \u201cthe defense needs of our country, bolstering Ukraine\u2019s air defense system, the F-16 coalition, and drafting of a bilateral security agreement.\u201d He also thanked US President Joe Biden for \u201can important decision\u201d regarding defensive strikes with American weapons, in reference to the White House\u2019s decision, as reported by CNN, to permit Ukraine to use American munitions for limited strikes within Russian territory.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/02/europe/zelensky-ukraine-shangrila-address-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "world"}}

The flames consumed some 4,000 dunams (1,000 acres or 400 hectares) of the northern region, chief of the Tiberias fire station Boris Eisenberg said. Israel Fire and Rescue Services said multiple firefighting teams, including an air firefighting squadron, had been deployed, working through the night. On Tuesday, Israel Fire and Rescue Services in the north of the country dealt with two blazes. Twelve teams were deployed to Keren Naftali, where a fire had spread in several directions, while 10 teams had been deployed to the Biria Forest in the Upper Galilee area, where a falling Israeli interceptor missile caused a second blaze.  \u201cWe saw the interception and responded with increased forces and high intensity, we are operating on the spot and trying to contain the fire,\u201d spokesperson Uri Cohen told CNN. \u201cWe are dealing with extreme weather conditions, changing winds, high dryness with low humidity, high temperature. All these conditions together accelerate the development of the fire,\u201d Cohen said. By late Tuesday, all major fires in the north had been brought under control, according to the rescue authority. Authorities had begun evacuating residents as fires broke out at noon local time on Monday in the mountainous Galilee region, Israeli police said. Israeli police said they helped to evacuate homes in Kiryat Shmona, a northern city near the Lebanese border. The blazes came after authorities warned the public Monday that a heatwave was expected and cautioned against lighting fires in forests. Lebanon-based Islamist group Hezbollah said Monday that it launched a \u201cswarm of drones\u201d at an Israeli military command center in the Galilee, causing fires in the building. The group said they were a response to Israeli strikes on Hezbollah forces as well as homes in southern Lebanon, adding that three Hezbollah fighters were killed on Monday. Thousands of Israeli residents have been displaced after cross-border hostilities began between Hezbollah and the Israeli military in October. The Lebanese group said its attacks on northern Israel were in response to Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. During a tour of some of the most heavily damaged areas, the Israel Defense Forces Chief of Staff Major General Herzi Halevi said the IDF was ready to respond if called on. \u201cWe are approaching the point where a decision will have to be made, and the IDF is prepared and very ready for this decision,\u201d Halevi said. \u201cWe have been attacking here for eight months and Hezbollah is paying a very, very high price.\u201d \u201cWe are prepared after a very good process of training \u2013 up to the level of a military exercise \u2013 to move to an attack in the north.

{"id": "2024_05_29_tech_ransomware-attacks-hospitals-patients-danger", "text": "A ransomware attack on a major US hospital network that began three weeks ago is endangering patients\u2019 health as nurses are forced to manually enter prescription information and work without electronic health records, nurses at two hospitals affected by the cyberattack told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s putting patients\u2019 lives in danger,\u201d said a nurse who works at Ascension Providence Rochester Hospital, a 290-bed facility about 25 miles north of downtown Detroit. \u201cPeople have too many patients for what is safe. Nurses are taking on five or six patients dealing with all of this paper charting.\u201d Another nurse, who works who works at a 409-bed Ascension hospital in Birmingham, Alabama, told CNN: \u201cIt is frightening how many safety guardrails [have been] out of service without any computers.\u201d The nurses spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect their jobs. The cyberattack hit Ascension, a St. Louis-based nonprofit that oversees 140 hospitals across 19 states, on May 8, but the healthcare network is still working to bring its systems back online. Ransomware attacks that cut off access to electronic health records are a grimly regular occurrence in American life. The health care sector\u00a0reported\u00a0249 ransomware attacks to the FBI last year, more than any other sector, with some cases affecting patient records. But the Ascension incident is raising concerns about the threat to patient health posed by cybercriminals in a way that numerous other ransomware attacks on US health providers haven\u2019t, according to interviews with nurses and cybersecurity experts. The two Ascension nurses said in separate interviews that they felt overwhelmed by the abrupt shift to paper records following the cyberattack, underwhelmed by their hospitals\u2019 plans for dealing with the situation and worried that they or their colleagues will make mistakes entering a patient\u2019s vital medical information. \u201cI don\u2019t have any orders in the computer,\u201d the Rochester, Michigan-based nurse said. \u201cI can\u2019t see what labs are ordered and their results.\u201d OPEIU Local 40, a union that represents nurses at Ascension Providence Rochester Hospital, distributed an online\u00a0petition\u00a0on Friday saying union members were \u201cdeeply concerned about the current challenges faced by our healthcare professionals\u201d because of the cyberattack, and urged the hospital to take a series of remediating steps, including limiting the nurse-to-patient ratio. Mac Walker, Ascension\u2019s director of media relations, did not answer CNN\u2019s questions about the petition or the nurses\u2019 comments on patient safety. Instead, Walker emailed this statement on Wednesday morning. \u201cRestoring EHR [electronic health records] access has been among the top priorities of our recovery process,\u201d Walker said. \u201cDue to the hard work of our teams over the past several days, we have successfully restored EHR access in our first market and are actively progressing against a plan to restore access across our network on a rolling basis.\u201d Walker did not respond when asked what Ascension\u2019s \u201cfirst market\u201d meant. Ascension, the fourth largest hospital network in the country\u00a0by some measures, said in a public statement Friday that it has been working\u00a0\u201caround the clock with industry-leading cybersecurity experts to safely restore operations across our network.\u201d In the wake of the Ascension hack and another ransomware attack in February that disrupted insurance billing at pharmacies across the US, Biden administration officials say they\u00a0are preparing\u00a0to release a set of minimum cybersecurity requirements for US hospitals.\u00a0But the cybersecurity challenges in the health sector are legion and beyond the scope of any one policy prescription, experts say. Senior officials from the White House and Department of Health and Human Services plan to meet with cybersecurity executives from health care companies on Wednesday to discuss how to better protect hospitals from hackers, three sources familiar with the meeting told CNN. \u2018Exorbitant\u2019 wait times for lab results In statements to the press, Ascension has said that its staff are \u201cappropriately trained to maintain high quality care during downtime.\u201d But the nurses interviewed by CNN say that the shift to paper records and manual operations is taking a toll on hospital operations. With computers down, doctors have been writing paper prescriptions for patients that nurses take to a machine to manually enter without a cross-check from the local pharmacy, according to the two nurses. \u201cThey have to put an override in there to get the medication out,\u201d said Dina Carlisle, president of OPEIU Local 40. \u201cThere\u2019s no second safety check from the pharmacy.\u201d It has also taken an exorbitantly long time to get lab results because of the hack, the nurse in Birmingham, Alabama, told CNN. A \u201cstat lab,\u201d or lab work needed to make quick decisions on patient care, that normally takes 30 minutes to an hour to process has taken hours, the nurse said. A growing problem for hospitals Ransomware attacks in the US\u00a0routinely force hospitals\u00a0to divert ambulances and cancel appointments. That causes a strain on neighboring hospitals that pick up the slack. But a lack of clear public understanding of how cyberattacks on hospitals directly impact patient care is undercutting the urgency needed to deal with the problem, according to health advocates and cybersecurity experts. Researchers are increasingly quantifying how lethal ransomware can be. Roughly 3 in 100 hospitalized Medicare patients will die in the hospital under normal conditions, but during a ransomware attack, that number increases to 4 out of 100 because of the strain on hospital resources,\u00a0according\u00a0to scholars at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health, who studied 374 ransomware attacks on health providers. Part of the problem,\u00a0experts say, is that some hospitals have failed basic tests of cybersecurity \u201chygiene,\u201d or sound defensive measures, while many small clinics lack the resources to secure themselves. And, perhaps more than any other sector, health care firms hold an enormous volume of sensitive data that is ripe for targeting and extortion schemes. The number of sensitive data records held by the health care sector grew by more than 63% last year \u201cfar surpassing any other industry and more than five times the global average,\u201d according to a study by security firm Rubrik. In February, cybercriminals broke into an unsecured computer server used by Change Healthcare, an insurance billing giant that processes about 15 billion health care transactions annually. The hack cut off health care providers from billions of dollars of revenue and snarled service at pharmacies across the US. Andrew Witty, the CEO of\u00a0UnitedHealth Group, which owns Change Healthcare,\u00a0apologized\u00a0in a recent congressional hearing for the security lapse and said he authorized a $22 million ransom payment to hackers to try to protect patient data. Yet a third of Americans could have had their data stolen in the hack, he said. \u201cWe routinely decline healthcare entities unwilling to address things like unpatched critical vulnerabilities, misconfigurations or uneven application of MFA [multi-factor authentication] \u2014 the very things hackers leverage to breach systems. And then we regularly see them breached later,\u201d Sezaneh Seymour, head of regulatory risk and policy at cyber insurance firm Coalition, told CNN. (She said her firm had no specific insights into the Change Healthcare or Ascension ransomware attacks.) Health care providers also make attractive targets for cyber extortionists because hospitals can ill-afford to be offline for long because of the disruptions it causes to operations. \u201cWhen we look at ransomware targeting, it\u2019s: who is the most easily targetable, who can afford little downtime and who has the highest willingness to pay,\u201d Bryan Vorndran, the FBI\u2019s senior most cyber-focused official, said in an interview. \u201cAnd where there\u2019s low-downtime environments, you have obviously a willingness to pay more so than in environments where they can afford downtime,\u201d Vorndran told CNN. \u201cI think all of that is relevant not just to the healthcare sector but to some other sectors as well.\u201d He declined to comment when asked about the Ascension hack.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/tech/ransomware-attacks-hospitals-patients-danger/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_04_china_china-change6-moon-lift-off-intl-hnk", "text": "China\u2019s Chang\u2019e-6 lunar probe departed from the far side of the moon on Tuesday, moving a step closer to completing an ambitious mission that underlines the country\u2019s rise as a\u00a0space superpower. In a symbolic moment before takeoff, China also reportedly became the first country to display its national flag on the moon\u2019s far side, which permanently faces away from Earth. The probe, carrying the first lunar rocks ever collected from the far side of the moon, took off and entered lunar orbit early Tuesday\u00a0Beijing time, following successful sample collection over the previous two days, according to a statement from the China National Space Administration (CNSA). Its return journey to Earth is estimated to take about three weeks, with a landing expected in China\u2019s Inner Mongolia region around June 25. The successful return of the samples would give China a head start in harnessing the strategic and scientific benefits of expanded lunar exploration \u2013 an increasingly competitive field that\u00a0has contributed to what\u00a0NASA chief Bill Nelson calls\u00a0a new \u201cspace race.\u201d This is the second time China has collected samples from the moon, after the Chang\u2019e-5 brought back rocks from the near side in 2020. Earlier this year, Nelson appeared to acknowledge China\u2019s pace \u2013 and concerns about its intentions \u2013 were driving the American urgency to return to the moon, decades after its Apollo-crewed missions. A photo posted by CNSA Tuesday and trending on China\u2019s X-like Weibo platform shows the drilled surface in a shape resembling the Chinese character \u201czhong,\u201d or \u201cmiddle\u201d in English\u00a0\u2013 the first character in the Chinese word for \u201cChina.\u201d The Chang\u2019e-6 probe withstood \u201cthe test of high temperatures\u201d and collected the samples by drilling into the moon\u2019s surface and scooping the soil and rocks up with a mechanical arm, CNSA said. After collecting the specimens, Chang\u2019e-6 extended a robotic arm to raise the Chinese flag, according to an animation released by CNSA. The flag, made from the volcanic rock basalt, was designed to resist corrosion and the extreme temperatures on the far side of the moon with an eye on future lunar missions, a Chang\u2019e-6 engineer told state-broadcaster CCTV. The rock \u201cwas crushed, melted and drawn into filaments about one third of the diameter of a human hair, then spun into thread and woven into cloth,\u201d said engineer Zhou Changyi. \u201cThe lunar surface is rich in basalt,\u201d Zhou added. \u201cSince we\u2019re building a lunar base in the future, we will most likely have to make basalt into fibers and use it as building materials.\u201d Historic mission Chang\u2019e-6 successfully landed on Sunday morning in the South Pole-Aitken Basin, the moon\u2019s oldest impact basin formed some 4 billion years ago. It marked the second time a mission has successfully reached the far side of the moon, after China first completed that historic feat in 2019 with its Chang\u2019e-4 probe. If all goes as planned, the mission \u2014 which began on May 3 and is expected to last 53 days \u2014 could be a\u00a0key milestone in China\u2019s push to become a\u00a0dominant space power. The country\u2019s plans include landing astronauts on the moon by 2030 and building a research base at its south pole, a region believed to contain water ice. Samples collected by the Chang\u2019e-6 lander could provide key clues into the origin and evolution of the moon, Earth and the solar system, experts say\u00a0\u2013 while the mission itself provides important data and technical practice to advance China\u2019s lunar ambitions. \u201cThe enigmatic lunar far side is so different from the lunar nearside in so many ways, that without returned samples, lunar scientists can\u2019t fully understand the moon as an entire planetary body,\u201d said\u00a0James Head, a professor emeritus at Brown University who has\u00a0collaborated with\u00a0Chinese scientists leading the mission. \u201cReturned samples from Chang\u2019e 6 will permit major strides to be made in solving these problems.\u201d The far side of the moon is out of range of normal communications, which means Chang\u2019e-6 must also rely on a satellite that was launched into lunar orbit in March, the Queqiao-2. China plans to launch\u00a0two more missions\u00a0in the Chang-e series as it nears its 2030 target of sending astronauts to the moon. Space race Multiple nations are expanding their lunar programs, with a growing focus on securing access to resources and further deep-space exploration. Last year,\u00a0India landed\u00a0a spacecraft on the moon for the first time, while Russia\u2019s first lunar landing mission in decades ended in failure when its\u00a0Luna 25 probe crashed\u00a0into the moon\u2019s surface. In January, Japan became the fifth country to land a spacecraft on the moon, though its\u00a0Moon Sniper lander\u00a0faced power issues due to an incorrect landing angle. The following month, IM-1, a\u00a0NASA-funded mission\u00a0designed by Texas-based private firm Intuitive Machines, touched down close to the lunar south pole. That landing \u2013 the first by a US-made spacecraft in over five decades \u2013 is among several planned commercial missions intended to explore the lunar surface before NASA attempts to return US astronauts there\u00a0as soon as 2026\u00a0and build its scientific base camp.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/china/china-change6-moon-lift-off-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_03_style_taiwan-celebrities-political-pressure-china-intl-hnk", "text": "As Taiwan\u2019s biggest rock band took to the stage in Beijing late last month, their home island was reckoning with the latest act of Chinese aggression. For two days, the self-governing democracy was encircled by Chinese warships and fighter jets in the largest military exercises in over a year. Addressing the tens of thousands of fans at the sold-out Bird\u2019s Nest stadium, Mayday\u2019s lead singer Ashin did not mention the aggression. But what he did say has since caused no less friction. \u201cWe Chinese people must eat roast duck when we come to Beijing!\u201d he said. It may sound like an innocuous travel tip, but his choice of words was freighted with political meaning. Ashin \u2013 one of Taiwan\u2019s biggest music stars \u2013 had referred to himself as Chinese, instead of Taiwanese. The choice of words delighted the crowd, but sparked immediate anger back home \u2013 reflecting the precarious position of Taiwanese stars with mainland appeal. Growing numbers of people in Taiwan \u2013 especially the younger generation \u2013 view themselves as distinctly Taiwanese. Many have no desire to be part of China, whose authoritarian ruling Communist Party views the self-ruled island as its territory, despite having never controlled it. Beijing has long sought to bolster its claims by emphasizing the cultural and historical ties between the two sides, but polls show only\u00a03% of Taiwan\u2019s population identify primarily as Chinese\u00a0\u2013 while 67% see themselves as primarily Taiwanese, and less than 10% now support an immediate or eventual unification with China. Under the leadership of Xi Jinping,\u00a0Beijing has become more aggressive toward Taiwan, and has abandoned official ties since the island\u2019s ruling Democratic Progressive Party came to power in 2016. But there is still considerable cultural overlap. Both sides speak Mandarin, meaning musicians from Taiwan \u2013 population 23 million \u2013 often seek to enter the lucrative market of 1.4 billion across the strait. As Beijing and Taipei have drifted further apart politically, these artists have come under increasing pressure to toe Beijing\u2019s political line. The same evening that Mayday was playing in Beijing,\u00a0Taiwanese pop queen Jolin Tsai proclaimed on stage that fans in \u201cour Chinese city of Nanchang\u201d were the most passionate, as she performed in the southern city. The phrase was taken by some Chinese fans as implying she and her audience were compatriots. Meanwhile on Weibo, China\u2019s X-like platform, dozens of Taiwanese actors, musicians, and celebrities reposted a state media post championing Beijing\u2019s claims of sovereignty over the island. \u201c\u2018Taiwan independence\u2019 is a dead end, and the reunification of the motherland is unstoppable!\u201d broadcaster CCTV said in the post, which has been retweeted nearly\u00a018 million times since it was published last Wednesday. On Douban, a popular site for reviewing movies, books and music, users compiled a list of nearly 100 Taiwanese celebrities, detailing whether each of them had shared the post. Despite her on-stage expression of kinship, some lashed out at Tsai for not reposting it. A comment with 14,000 upvotes called for authorities to suspend her concerts in China, because she \u201chad never spoken out directly.\u201d CNN has reached out to Tsai for comment. On Saturday, CCTV publicly endorsed Taiwanese celebrities who shared its post, sharing the screenshots of 36 such reposts \u2013 fueling a further backlash against those who hadn\u2019t. \u201cThose who didn\u2019t endorse and take a stand, can you not come to the mainland to make money?\u201d said a top comment with 55,000 upvotes. Lin Chen-yu, a lecturer at Cardiff University who specializes in China\u2019s censorship of Taiwanese music, said acts such as Tsai and Mayday were facing problems because \u201cboth the government and private sectors are increasingly reacting to and engaging with digital nationalism.\u201d And the marketing apparatus that can launch mainland careers is equally set up to avoid upsetting Beijing authorities. \u201cFor instance, management or touring contracts for activities in China increasingly include clauses that ban celebrities from making statements against the ideologies of the Chinese state,\u201d she said. \u201cThis, of course, includes any pro-Taiwan statements.\u201d Celebrities deemed as crossing Beijing\u2019s political red lines are often blocked from the Chinese market, with their names and works erased from television and online platforms. \u201cFor example, musicians\u2019 work can be easily removed from streaming platforms (in China), often automatically, if their names become keywords for censors on these platforms and media,\u201d Lin said. Backlash at home Mayday appear to have avoided upsetting officials in China during their Beijing show, but many Taiwanese fans say they are deeply disappointed. A whole generation of Taiwanese people grew up listening to the band\u2019s happy-go-lucky, pop-infused rock songs about the hope and heartbreak of youth, so much so that the 25-year-old band is sometimes dubbed the \u201cAsian Beatles.\u201d \u201cAs much as I used to like you, now I\u2019m just as disappointed,\u201d said a comment on Mayday\u2019s Facebook page, after the Beijing concert. \u201cI\u2019m Taiwanese. Goodbye.\u201d a fan said on Ashin\u2019s Facebook page. CNN has reached out to Mayday\u2019s record company B\u2019in Music for comment. On Monday, Taiwan\u2019s Mainland Affairs Council weighed in, accusing the Chinese Communist Party of requiring Taiwanese artists to express a political stance. \u201cSuch political maneuvers will not win over the hearts and minds of Taiwanese people, and will only deepen Taiwanese society\u2019s resentment towards the Chinese Communist regime,\u201d the council said in a statement. The remarks and retweets by Taiwanese artists of the CCTV unification post came against the backdrop of China\u2019s largest show of force around the island in more than a year. The Chinese military called the drills a \u201cstrong punishment\u201d for Taiwan\u2019s so-called \u201cseparatist acts\u201d and said they were designed to test its ability to \u201cseize power.\u201d That military muscle-flex was sparked by the inauguration of Taiwan\u2019s new President Lai Ching-te, who is openly loathed by Beijing for championing the island\u2019s sovereignty and distinct identity. As the backlash mounted in Taiwan against the musicians, Lai struck a conciliatory tone. \u201cThis is not the first time, and probably not the last, that Taiwanese artists are forced to make a political stand in China,\u201d said the leader. \u201cUnder the roof of others, it\u2019s one thing what our artists say, but what\u2019s more important is what they truly feel in their hearts. We should offer them understanding and empathy.\u201d Beijing officials said the Taipei administration was wrong to say artists were being coerced. Zhu Fenglian, a spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office, said Taiwanese celebrities who reposted the Weibo \u201creunification\u201d message wanted \u201cto express that both sides of the Taiwan Strait are both Chinese.\u201d \u201cThese are natural expressions of true feelings,\u201d Zhu said. Taiwanese acts in the Chinese market will continue to endure an invidious position, said Lin, of Cardiff University. \u201cHowever, it is time for the industries in Taiwan to re-evaluate what this means for our society,\u201d she said. \u201cThe circulation of these works comes with a price \u2013 a significant loss of freedom and autonomy.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/style/taiwan-celebrities-political-pressure-china-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_03_middleeast_israeli-hostages-dead-intl-latam", "text": "The Israel Defense Forces says its representatives have informed the families of four hostages being held in Gaza \u201cthat they are no longer alive.\u201d The IDF said it had told the families of Chaim Peri, Yoram Metzger, Amiram Cooper, and Nadav Popplewell \u201cwho were brutally abducted to the Gaza Strip on October 7, that they are no longer alive and that their bodies are held by the Hamas terrorist organization.\u201d The IDF said the decision to pronounce the four hostages dead was based on intelligence and was confirmed by a Ministry of Health expert committee, in coordination with the Ministry of Religious Services and the Chief Rabbi of Israel. The circumstances of their deaths in Hamas captivity are still under examination, according to the IDF, which says it uses a \u201ca wide variety of methods to gather information about the hostages who remain in the Gaza Strip.\u201d Chief spokesperson for the IDF, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, said \u201cTheir loved ones were killed a few months ago during Hamas captivity in Gaza and their bodies are still being held by Hamas. We assess that the four of them were killed while together in the area of Khan Younis during an operation there against Hamas.\u201d In May, Hamas said Popplewell, an Israeli-British citizen, had died from wounds following a strike by Israeli fighter jets on his place of detention over a month earlier. CNN is not able to independently verify the claim by Hamas. More than 250 people were taken hostage and moved to Gaza during Hamas\u2019 October 7 attack on Israel but more than 100 were released during a temporary truce last year. The Israeli Prime Minister\u2019s Office believes there are still 124 hostages, living and dead, in Gaza \u2013 four of whom were taken before October 7. Of the remaining 120 who were taken on October 7, Israel now believes 41 are dead. Israeli War Cabinet minister and Chairman of Israel\u2019s National Unity Party, Benny Gantz sent condolences to the families of those declared dead on Monday, saying on his Telegram channel the news was \u201ca painful reminder of our supreme moral duty to continue to fight against terrorism and to do everything to return all the hostages home as soon as possible, even at painful costs.\u201d The latest deaths are likely to increase pressure on the Israeli leadership to secure a ceasefire proposal outlined by US President Joe Biden last week. Following news of the four deaths, the Hostage and Missing Families Forum in Israel reiterated its demand to the Israeli government to immediately approve the proposal. The organization called the news of the four deaths a mark of disgrace and a sad reflection on the significance of delaying previous deals. \u201cThe Israeli government must send out a negotiating delegation this evening and return all 124 hostages, both living and murdered, to their homes,\u201d the group said in a statement Monday. \u201cChaim, Yoram, Amiram, and Nadav were kidnapped alive, some of them were with other hostages who returned in the previous deal \u2013 and they should have returned alive to their country and their families,\u201d the statement added. The three-phase proposal outlined by Biden on Friday would secure the release of hostages paired with a ceasefire. The US president outlined the plan \u2013 which he said was proposed by Israel \u2013 in unusual detail in what appears to have been an attempt to pressure both Israel and Hamas into an agreement. On Monday, leaders from the Group of 7 (G7) nations added to that pressure by endorsing the proposal, calling on Hamas to accept it, and claiming that \u201cIsrael is ready to move forward\u201d with it. However, whether Israel is, in fact, \u201cready to move forward\u201d with the plan laid out by Biden remains something of an unknown, as the Israeli government has offered a series of non-committal statements that have created a degree of uncertainty about the plan. British Foreign Secretary David Cameroon also noted the proposal in a post on the social media platform X, in which he said he was \u201cgreatly saddened\u201d by the death of Israeli-British citizen Popplewell. \u201cMy thoughts are with his loved ones at this terrible time for them,\u201d Cameron\u00a0wrote. \u201cWith a new deal on the table, we reiterate our demand for Hamas to send all hostages home.\u201d Husbands, fathers, brothers The Hostage and Missing Families Forum released the following information on the four hostages declared dead Monday. Nadav Popplewell: 51, from Kibbutz Nirim, a family man of distinction and a generous friend, a lover of books and science fiction. Nadav was kidnapped from his home\u2019s safe room along with his mother, Channa Peri, who was released after 49 days in captivity. His older brother, Roy, was murdered on October 7. Amiram Cooper: 84, one of the founders of Kibbutz Nir Oz. He was kidnapped together with his wife, Nurit, who was released from Hamas captivity after 17 days. Amiram saw the establishment of the kibbutz as his life\u2019s mission. He was an economist, poet, and composer. He is survived by his wife, three children, and nine grandchildren. Yoram Metzger: 80, from Kibbutz Nir Oz, kidnapped from his home along with his wife, Tamar, who was released from Hamas captivity after 53 days. Yoram was a man of family and people, stories and humor. He was one of the founders of the Nir Oz Winery. Yoram is survived by his wife Tamar, three children, and seven grandchildren. Chaim Peri: 80, from Kibbutz Nir Oz, a man of peace, art, and cinema. He taught in schools in the area and at Sapir College. He established and built the art gallery in the kibbutz and the sculpture garden. He was one of the founders of the Nir Oz Winery. Chaim was abducted from the safe room in his home while protecting his wife, Osnat. He is survived by his wife, five children, and 13 grandchildren.

{"id": "2024_06_04_middleeast_iran-military-adviser-killed-israel-syria-intl", "text": "Israeli airstrikes near the Syrian city of Aleppo early Monday killed an Iranian military adviser, Iranian media reported, two months after the Middle East came to the brink of a major war as Israel and Iran engaged in unprecedented direct attacks on each other\u2019s soil. Saeed Abiyar, an adviser to Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) in Syria, died in the attack, Iran\u2019s semi-official Tasnim news agency reported. Syrian state news agency SANA said the incident occurred around 12.20 a.m. local time on Monday after Israel launched an aerial attack with missiles, targeting \u201ca number of points\u201d in the vicinity of Aleppo, without providing information on fatalities. CNN has requested comment from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), which does not usually acknowledge such strikes. Abiyar is the first member of the IRGC to be reported killed by Israel since April, when Israel is suspected to have bombed the Iranian embassy compound in Damascus, killing several commanders, including the top IRGC commander in charge of relations with Syria and Lebanon. The Islamic Republic retaliated to that attack by launching a barrage of drones and missiles toward Israel, most of which were intercepted. Israel fired back, a US official told CNN, targeting a major Iranian military airbase near the city of Isfahan. Iran has deployed military advisers to Syria in support of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad since civil war broke out there in 2011. Israel is believed to have launched several strikes on Iranian and Hezbollah targets in Syria in recent years, particularly since the start of its war with Hamas in Gaza. It has warned that Iran is turning it into \u201ca base for aggression against Israel.\u201d What happens next? After the tit-for-tat exchange in April, Iran said it had created \u201ca new equation\u201d with Israel, pledging to retaliate every time Israel attacks its interests in the future. \u201cThe era of strategic patience is over,\u201d said Mohammad Jamshidi, deputy chief of staff to the Iranian president. Monday\u2019s attack suggests that Iran\u2019s \u201cnew equation,\u201d indicating that it has restored deterrence, may not have been achieved, said Trita Parsi, a Washington DC-based Iran analyst and executive vice president of the Quincy Institute think tank, adding that this is the first attack of its kind since April\u2019s exchange of fire. It took place at a time of domestic turbulence for Iran. Former President Ebrahim Raisi was killed last month in a helicopter crash along with Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian and other Iranian officials. Iran is now in the process of electing a new leader. \u201cThe Israelis may very well have calculated that this is an opportune time to strike,\u201d Parsi told CNN, adding that the attack may leave Iranian officials in a quandary on how to respond. The killing also occurred as Israel faces growing isolation on the world stage for its devastating war in Gaza, as pressure mounts from multiple fronts for it to end hostilities. Last week, US President Joe Biden joined the chorus of world leaders to call for an end to the war. Abiyar\u2019s killing raises the stakes of a repeat of April\u2019s unprecedented tit-for-tat direct strikes between Iran and Israel. But escalation is not a given. What triggered Iran\u2019s ire in April was likely a combination of escalatory factors, that the strike took place on its consulate in Damascus, which is technically Iranian soil. Israel contested this, claiming the target was an Iranian military headquarters. Monday\u2019s strike doesn\u2019t reach the same threshold. Neither country, in April or now, appears to want escalation. Tehran will have a choice to make, Parsi said. \u201cOn the one hand, they\u2019re going to have pressure to respond in order to claim that their deterrence has been restored. On the other hand, do they want to have an escalation in the midst of this very sensitive election?\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/middleeast/iran-military-adviser-killed-israel-syria-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_03_americas_haiti-mss-pentagon-contracts-intl-latam", "text": "As preparations accelerate for a multinational security force to deploy to Haiti, federal contract opportunities from the US Department of Defense detail the minutiae of US involvement in planning for the mission. The Multinational Security Support mission, widely referred to as the MSS, aims to bolster local police in combatting the gangs currently overrunning Haiti\u2019s capital Port-au-Prince. After several delays, the Kenya-led mission is expected to arrive in the Caribbean nation in the coming weeks. The US \u00a0has championed the mission, offering to\u00a0provide hundreds of millions of dollars\u00a0in funding and resources, though drawing a line at boots on the ground. Recent contract opportunities posted to a US General Services Administration website by\u00a0the Defense Department (DOD)\u00a0illustrate how closely the US is involved in kitting out the multinational security\u00a0force \u2014 from security for their still-under-construction base to toothbrushes and internet. On Tuesday May 21, the Defense Department published a contract opportunity for commercial internet service providers capable of supporting about 1,400 users in Haiti, according to the website. Contract opportunities published the same day also advertise opportunities for vendors to provide \u201csundry items\u201d\u2014shampoo, toothbrushes, lotions, and other items\u2014and bedding for 1,300 people in Haiti. As conditions for the mission come together, US security contractors are already on the ground in Haiti, about 150 people as of now, a source familiar with the operation told CNN. A posting on the same website also shows that the\u00a0DOD awarded a $30 million contract to GardaWorld Federal Services LLC for private security and protection\u00a0services in Haiti for contractors preparing the\u00a0mission\u00a0base. GardaWorld, a Canadian company which\u00a0provides logistical, medical, and security services to government and commercial clients, told CNN\u00a0that they were contracted to provide these services at the housing site. The firm has previously been involved with protecting US diplomatic facilities in Afghanistan\u2014a role that is the subject of ongoing litigation initially brought by a former employee, Justin Fahn, who alleges in a whistleblower lawsuit\u00a0the company misled the US about its\u00a0employees\u2019 training. GardaWorld denies these claims in court records, and a spokesperson for the company\u00a0told CNN that it is employing \u201chighly trained security professionals\u201d to guard the facility in Haiti. \u201cBeyond the contract information made publicly available in the\u00a0sam.gov\u00a0platform, we would not have additional details to provide at this time,\u201d a Pentagon spokesperson said when reached for comment by CNN. A long-delayed mission Gang violence has wreaked havoc in Haiti, stifling civilians\u2019 access to food, water, and fuel. Armed groups control large swathes\u00a0of Haiti\u2019s capital city and forced the international airport in Port au Prince to shut down; after nearly three months, commercial flights resumed in mid-May. The MSS base is expected to be located close to Toussaint Louverture International Airport in capital city Port-au-Prince.\u00a0Satellite imagery captured on May 20 by\u00a0Maxar Technologies, obtained by CNN, shows a significant construction close to the\u00a0airport\u00a0since\u00a0mid-May.\u00a0The\u00a0expansion appears to include at least\u00a0five new structures and newly cleared land at the eastern end of the tarmac. US President Joe Biden\u00a0has said that he is working with Congress to provide $300 million for the mission and an additional $60 million for equipment to the country. \u201cThere\u2019s\u00a0going to be US\u00a0forces not on the ground, but we\u2019re going to supply logistics, intelligence, and equipment. Matter of fact, some equipment has already arrived,\u201d Biden said last week during a joint press conference with Kenyan\u00a0President William Ruto. In response to a question later in the briefing, Biden also sought to explain why the US isn\u2019t putting boots on the ground. \u201cFor the United States to deploy forces in the hemisphere just raises all kinds of questions that can be easily misrepresented about what we\u2019re trying to do\u2026 we want to do everything we can without once again looking like America is stepping over, deciding this is what must be done,\u201d Biden said. According to documents seen by CNN, the mission will be helmed by a Kenyan police commissioner and a Jamaican police lieutenant, with other top posts filled by Kenyan staff. The Bahamas, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belize, Benin, Chad, and Jamaica have also promised to contribute personnel to the mission. May 23 was the informal deadline for a contingent to be on the ground, but the initial deployment was delayed last week after a Kenyan delegation assessed that equipment on the ground was insufficient, according to sources in Haiti and DC. Sources said a primary concern for the Kenyan assessors \u2013 including several high-ranking police commanders \u2013 was whether there would be helicopters at the ready for medical evacuation. The MSS was authorized last year\u00a0by the United Nations Security Council\u00a0to\u00a0assist Haitian National Police in fighting gang violence and provide stability in the Caribbean country, following a request for military intervention by its government.\u00a0Police unions and law enforcement sources in Haiti have however complained about a lack of clear planning for how they will coordinate with the foreign force. CNN has reached out to the Haitian National Police for comment on the delay of the mission and logistical preparations for Haiti.

{"id": "2024_06_03_americas_mexico-election-result-first-female-president-intl-hnk", "text": "Mexico has elected its first female president,\u00a0with preliminary results showing Claudia Sheinbaum, a climate scientist and Mexico City\u2019s former mayor, is on track to win the country\u2019s largest election in history. Sheinbaum has won between\u00a058.3% and 60.7% of the vote,\u00a0according to what is known as Quick Count, an exercise that the National Electoral Institute (INE) carries out based on a statistical sample of ballots from polling stations. The 61-year-old rode the wave of popularity of her\u00a0longtime political ally, the outgoing leftist Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, and their Morena party. Sheinbaum is not only set to be Mexico\u2019s first female president, but also the country\u2019s first Jewish leader, although she rarely speaks publicly about her personal background and has governed as a secular leftist. Sheinbaum said her administration would govern all Mexicans \u201cwithout distinction.\u201d \u201cEven though many Mexicans do not fully agree with our project, we will have to walk in peace and harmony to continue building a fair and more prosperous Mexico,\u201d she told crowds of supporters that filled the main square in Mexico City, the Z\u00f3calo, in the early hours of Monday. She spoke about the historical significance of becoming the first female president of the country. \u201cI am also grateful because, for the first time in 200 years of the republic, I will become the first woman president of Mexico,\u201d she said. Trailing Sheinbaum is opposition candidate X\u00f3chitl G\u00e1lvez, backed by a coalition of the National Action (PAN), Institutional Revolutionary (PRI) and Democratic Revolution (PRD) parties,\u00a0with between 26.6% and 28.6% of the votes. In third place is the Citizens\u2019 Movement candidate, Jorge \u00c1lvarez M\u00e1ynez, with\u00a0between 9.9% and 10.8% of the votes. According to the quick count results, participation in the presidential election\u00a0was\u00a0between 58.9% and 61.7% of the electorate of nearly 100 million people. Obrador, the outgoing president and Sheinbaum\u2019s political mentor, congratulated Sheinbaum on her win. \u201cWith all my affection and respect I congratulate Claudia Sheinbaum who came out victorious with an ample margin. She will be the first (female) President of Mexico\u2026 but also the President, possibly, with most votes obtained in all of the history of our country,\u201d he said in a\u00a0video\u00a0posted on X. Sheinbaum\u2019s projected win is a remarkable moment for a country that is a world leader when it comes to gender equality in elected office, a position it cemented in 2019 with constitutional reform. It\u00a0outflanks\u00a0several countries in\u00a0terms of women\u2019s\u00a0parliamentary representation. Yet Mexico remains a dangerous place to be a woman: it has\u00a0sky-high femicide\u00a0rates with around 10 women\u00a0murdered in Mexico every day. Sheinbaum ran Mexico\u2019s most important city for\u00a0five years until her resignation last June to run for the presidency. She is also the co-author of a Nobel-winning\u00a0Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report\u00a0and is married to Jes\u00fas Mar\u00eda Tarriba Unger. She is seen as a continuation of the status quo left by L\u00f3pez Obrador, whose\u00a0social welfare programs boosted the Morena party\u2019s\u00a0popularity and had a positive impact on the lives of poorer Mexicans. Under the Mexican constitution, presidents can only be elected to one term and cannot run again. Sheinbaum has pledged to continue her predecessor\u2019s policies, including a pension for all senior citizens, scholarships for more than 12 million students and free fertilizers for small farm owners, but has rejected criticism of her close political alignment with\u00a0L\u00f3pez Obrador. She is set to be replaced as the mayor of Mexico City by another women, Clara Marina Brugada Molina from Scheinbaum\u2019s Morena party. She secured between 49% and 52.8% of the votes, according to the Quick Count, while the opposition Santiago Taboada got 37.2% to 40.5% of the votes. Largest election Sunday\u2019s poll was the largest election in the country\u2019s history. More than 98 million voters were registered to cast a ballot, and 1.4 million Mexicans were eligible to vote abroad. In addition to the presidency, more than 20,000 positions\u00a0were being contested by an estimated 70,000 candidates vying to become senators, mayors and governors. But the elections were plagued by immense violence. There have been more than 20 political killings since September, according to the Mexican government. By some estimates though, that number is even higher. According to Mexican consultancy firm Integralia, at least 34 candidates were murdered in the run-up to the vote. Voting was suspended for several hours on Sunday in the southeastern Mexican town of Coyomeapan due to violence at the polling centers, according to state electoral authorities. And while\u00a0the murder rate fell\u00a0in Mexico\u00a0between 2019 and 2022, in absolute numbers the country is still reeling from historically high levels of around 30,000 homicides\u00a0each year. The true number is likely higher, experts say. The violence appeared to have been a top concern for voters as cartels extend their grip through Mexico. Sheinbaum has been coy about her security proposals but has pointed to her record as Mexico City mayor, when, according to her team, she improved the police force\u2019s working conditions and intelligence-gathering abilities. One big challenge for her will be\u00a0convincing voters that she can end the culture of impunity in Mexico, where around 95%\u00a0of all crimes nationwide\u00a0went unsolved in\u00a02022, according to think tank\u00a0Mexico Evalua. After the final results come in, the Electoral Tribunal of the Judicial Branch of the Federation (TEPJF) must receive and analyze any possible challenges to the process, as well as qualify the presidential election no later than September 6. If the court validates the election, Sheinbaum will take office on October 1. Her term will last six years, from 2024 to 2030.

North Korea\u2019s vice-defense minister Kim Kang Il said that the country will \u201ctemporarily halt dropping trash over the border,\u201d after claiming to have sent a total of 15 tonnes of trash to its neighbor, according to his statement released by state media KCNA on Sunday. Kim said the balloon were \u201cstrictly a responsive act\u201d to South Korea\u2019s years-long practice of sending balloons with anti-North Korea leaflets the other way. \u201cWe\u2019ve let the South Koreans experience enough of how dirty it feels and how much joint effort it takes to clean up spread-out rubbish,\u201d Kim said. A South\u00a0Korean official pledged his country would take\u00a0\u201cunendurable measures\u201d against North\u00a0Korea for sending more trash balloons this weekend, which will be \u201cspecified in the coming days.\u201d The official from the presidential office added that the government \u201cwill\u00a0not rule out the issue of resuming [playing] loudspeakers\u201d that used to blast propaganda across the demilitarized zone, but had been turned off since a military agreement was signed in 2018. South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff\u00a0said \u201cno substances harmful to safety\u201d were found among the hundreds more balloons that reached the country on Saturday evening \u2013 unlike just a few days ago when used toilet paper was found in some of the about 150 balloons that crossed the border. The latest photos released by the JCS show a large sack containing what appears to be paper left on the roadside, while other images show officers inspecting the garbage strewn on the ground. Others showed burned-out cigarette butts. According to images released by authorities, the packages are conveyed by large, gas-filled balloons. South Korea said its military is working with the police, local government, safety ministry, and the United Nations Command to safely retrieve the balloons and the debris. The balloons were found in the capital Seoul, as well as the provinces of Gyeonggi and Chungcheong. Some were even spotted more than 300 kilometers (over 185 miles) south of the capital, in Gyeongsang province. The two neighboring countries\u00a0have been cut off from each other since the end of the\u00a0Korean War in 1953\u00a0with an armistice. They are still technically at war. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un\u2019s sister Kim Yo Jong \u2013 a senior official in the reclusive regime \u2013 called the balloons \u201csincere presents,.\u201d North Korea is almost completely closed off from the rest of the world, with tight control over what information gets in or out. Foreign materials including movies and books are banned, with only a few state-sanctioned exceptions; those caught with foreign contraband often face severe punishment, defectors say. Earlier this year a South Korean research group released rare footage that it claimed showed North Korean teenagers\u00a0sentenced to hard labor\u00a0for watching and distributing K-dramas. Restrictions softened somewhat in recent decades as North Korea\u2019s relationship with China expanded.

{"id": "2024_05_31_weather_power-grid-outages-us-texas-climate", "text": "Picture this: It\u2019s a Thursday night in Houston and thunderstorms are rolling in. Suddenly, winds roar past 100 mph. Trees snap, windows shatter and the city darkens as power flickers out. Even after it\u2019s over, it takes days for the lights to come back on in parts of the city. A week and a half later, the Tuesday morning commute is just getting underway in Dallas. Thunderstorms rush through the city, unleashing hurricane-strength wind gusts and torrential rain. Trees and power lines topple to the ground, cutting power to hundreds of thousands of people. Many homes and businesses remain without power days later. That\u2019s exactly the scenario that played out in Texas over the past few weeks, and these kinds of outages are happening more frequently as destructive extreme weather thrashes the aging electric grid. From 2000 to 2023, 80% of all major US power outages were due to weather, according to analysis by Climate Central, a non-profit research group. The number of weather-related outages from 2014 to 2023 doubled compared to outages at the start of the century. Being without power is not only expensive \u2013 keeping people out of work and school, and keeping businesses closed \u2013 it\u2019s dangerous. There doesn\u2019t need to be a heat wave in Texas for summertime temperatures to soar to unhealthy levels. Heat is particularly dangerous without A/C at night, which is when the body needs to cool itself after a hot day. Experts say there could be ways to keep the lights on in the face of extreme conditions, even if there\u2019s no single perfect solution. Why can\u2019t the lights stay on? Power generation, transmission and distribution within the US happens on a power grid, an interconnected series of power plants, power lines and electrical substations. But the grid\u2019s infrastructure is aging fast and struggling to keep up with modern power demands, according to the US Department of Energy. It\u2019s also struggling as extreme weather gets more intense as the planet warms. \u201cOur (power) infrastructure was built for the weather of the past,\u201d Michael Webber, a professor of engineering at the University of Texas said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t built for the weather of the future, and the weather of the future is already here.\u201d A majority of the US electric grid was built in the 1960s and 1970s, but some of the first parts of the system were constructed in the early 1900s. And 70% of transmission lines in the US are approaching the end of their 50- to 80-year lifecycles, according to the DOE. Every element within the power grid is vulnerable in some way to extreme weather, Webber told CNN. Power is largely distributed by above-ground power lines from large transmission towers to smaller \u2013 and abundant \u2013 power poles. Most outages happen because of failures with power lines and poles, making them a \u201cbig weakness\u201d in the overall system, according to Webber. Severe weather \u2013 defined as thunderstorms, high winds, heavy rain and tornadoes \u2013 was far and away the main cause of weather-related major outages at 58%, according to Climate Central. And it directly impacts these exposed lines. Power lines and poles can be brought down by falling tree limbs, topple over in fierce winds and be snapped by heavy ice. Extreme events, like the derecho and tornado that tore through the Houston in mid-May, can turn massive transmission towers into mangled metal. Hurricanes, like 2021\u2019s Ida, inflict damage at a colossal scale. When infrastructure can\u2019t withstand extreme weather, it not only disrupts power, it also creates its own disasters: The massive Smokehouse Creek Fire ignited earlier this year after a \u201cdecayed\u201d power pole toppled in strong winds, according to a report from the Texas House of Representatives. But it\u2019s not just power lines and power poles under attack from extreme weather; the things that generate power can also take a beating. Blasts of frigid cold can freeze necessary equipment, leaving it unable to keep up with demand. Historic cold shuttered power plants and froze non-winterized wind turbines in Texas in 2021. The resulting power outages were vast and deadly in the brutal cold. Meanwhile, searing heat sends electricity demands skyrocketing as cooling needs surge. If power needs cannot be met, blackouts and brownouts arise. Equipment also overheats and fails if temperatures soar too high. Modernized equipment can keep the A/C running \u2013 for a price In order to keep power flowing during extreme weather, or restore it quickly in the aftermath, the US grid needs to be upgraded and fortified on a vast scale. It will cost trillions of dollars to do this well, according to Webber. Power poles, power lines and transmission equipment need to be built or rebuilt stronger and operate at a higher capacity to keep larger amounts of power flowing, even when demand spikes. At the most basic level, a wooden power pole is less durable and has a shorter lifespan than a metal pole. Installing sturdy, metal poles means more stay upright in extreme weather, but they could come at an environmental cost, given how energy intensive it is to make steel. Fortified power lines above ground will still sometimes be knocked over by violent storms, so another solution is to put power lines underground. Parts of the US are already doing this, including cities like Anaheim, California, and Fort Collins, Colorado. But burying electricity isn\u2019t perfect solution, either. Running power lines underground is often 10 times more expensive than building overhead wires, and the lines are susceptible to flooding and can be difficult for crews to service, according to Rob Gramlich, founder and president of Grid Strategies, a power grid consulting firm. Modernization of outdated power lines costs around $100,000 per mile, while new power lines can run anywhere from $1 million to $10 million per mile depending on geography and whether they are above or underground, according to Webber. But it\u2019s an investment that will pay for itself when fewer power lines spark devastating wildfires or outages that cost up to billions of dollars are avoided, Webber contends. A stronger grid also has to have smarter controls to rapidly reroute power where it\u2019s needed when outages do occur. \u201cAny number of things can happen to power generation in any one area,\u201d Gramlich told CNN. \u201cBut if you have fortified inter-regional transmission, you have an insurance policy against many risks.\u201d The US is designed so that if power needs in one region spike because of increased demand or power generation fails, another region steps in to help handle the load. Renewable energy sources like solar and wind make the grid more resilient by diversifying the number of ways power is generated if another method fails. But, the energy generated by renewable means is still delivered via the same vulnerable infrastructure as all other power. It may be an insurmountable task to eliminate weather-related power outages completely, but it should be possible to eradicate major, multi-day outages. \u201cUltimately, I think it really should be extremely rare to have a multi-day power outage,\u201d Gramlich said. \u201cWe can plan the whole electricity system so that never happens.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/weather/power-grid-outages-us-texas-climate/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "world"}}

The NBA star\u2019s congratulatory message on Tuesday was for Anthony Claytor of Akron, Ohio, who graduated from Kent State University in May, becoming the first student from James\u2019 I Promise School to earn a bachelor\u2019s degree. \u201cCONGRATULATIONS ANTHONY!!!! SO PROUD OF YOU YOUNG [prince],\u201d James wrote on X. Claytor is a member of the inaugural class of the I Promise School, which opened in 2018, and is part of James\u2019 efforts to offer education and opportunities to at-risk children and their families in Northeast Ohio. In 2020, all 193 students in that inaugural class were given four years of free tuition to attend Kent State University, as well as one year of room and board fully paid for. Claytor made the most of his opportunity, graduating early with a Bachelor of Arts in criminology and justice studies with a minor in sociology. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for the LeBron James Family Foundation, I don\u2019t know if I would have gone to college,\u201d Claytor said. \u201cI don\u2019t know where I would be.\u201d The 21-year-old Claytor added: \u201cIf I went \u2026 somewhere else, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to live on campus and meet new people, develop relationships or join organizations.

{"id": "2024_06_04_sport_xabi-alonso-bayer-leverkusen-season-spt-intl", "text": "In life, as in soccer, it\u2019s often said that it\u2019s not the destination, it\u2019s the journey. Xabi Alonso and Bayer Leverkusen are a living, breathing testament to that. This season, they\u2019ve taken their fans on a journey the likes of which they could only have dreamed about. A season which has defied all expectations, rewritten the history books and set new standards the likes of which the modern European game has never witnessed before. An unprecedented unbeaten domestic league season and two trophies have led to a full rebrand from the derided \u2018Neverkusen\u2019 to the lauded \u2018Neverlusen.\u2019 \u201cFor sure, it\u2019s been quite a journey [\u2026] Very challenging, very demanding,\u201d Alonso told CNN Sport\u2019s Amanda Davies at the inaugural Globe Soccer Awards Europe Edition in Sardinia, Italy. \u201cDuring the first weeks of the competition, I had a good feeling that we could make a good season. \u201cFor sure, I was not that optimistic that we could fight until the last week, but that we could have a good season? Yes.\u201d Foundations for success Prior to his arrival at the BayArena in October 2022, Alonso had coached Real Madrid\u2019s Under-14 team and Real Sociedad\u2019s B team. He says it was at Sociedad where he came to understand the importance of player development, knowledge sharing and tactical adaptability; principles which he hoped to instill in his Leverkusen side. \u201cComing back to the roots, coming back to the work with the young players [at Real Sociedad] gave me this vision that is not always the elite, elite, elite where I had been playing, [but] to come back to a few levels behind and to try to talk on their level,\u201d explained Alonso. \u201c[It] helped me a lot to develop as a coach, as a manager and I don\u2019t want to forget that.\u201d The Spaniard joined a team languishing second from last in the Bundesliga, in desperate need of fresh ideas and a clear vision for upward mobility. A successful, strategically planned transfer window last summer fused together with Alonso\u2019s desire to home in on nurturing talent was key to laying the groundwork for a remarkable turnaround in fortunes. Bringing in experience and guile in the form of midfielder Granit Xhaka, harnessing the explosive abilities of full-back \u00c1lex Grimaldo and unleashing the lethal striking ability of forward Victor Boniface, combined with the existing talent of the masterful Florian Wirtz and Jeremie Frimpong, created a blend of grit and dynamism that would carry the team across three competitions this season. \u201cLast year, it was a difficult year for the club [\u2026] When I came, the second part of the season was better. We try to get back [to] where we thought that we could make it. The goal [this year] was to make Champions League,\u201d he said. Expectation vs. reality As it turned out, Champions League would be the bare minimum of what they would achieve. Week after week, the Leverkusen juggernaut rolled on in the Bundesliga. Statement victories over an inconsistent Bayern Munich side \u2013 the winner of the last 11 league titles \u2013 a propensity for last-gasp winners and demolition jobs on all other teams who stood in their way gave growing belief in what was only once but a dream: an unbeaten season. \u201cIn the team, [the talk] wasn\u2019t that much the unbeaten run, it was more like the spectacular numbers that we were doing,\u201d he said. \u201c[From] all the media, there\u2019s this excitement of what\u2019s happening that [Leverkusen] are: \u2018One more game, one more game. 42, 43 and it continues.\u2019 So that adds some kind of pressure [\u2026] We prefer to think about short goals than more in the long term.\u201d Since winning the German Cup in 1993, Leverkusen had a propensity for falling at the final hurdle \u2013 be it finishing runner-up in the league multiple times or on the European stage, most famously to Real Madrid in the 2002 Champions League final. But not this year; after 29 games unbeaten in the league, the 31 year trophy drought was over and the club\u2019s first ever Bundesliga title had been won in dominant circumstances. Victory against Augsburg on the final day of the season completed a never before seen in Germany \u2018Invincibles\u2019 league season and extended the overall unbeaten run to 51 games, eclipsing the previous record of 48 games set by Benfica between 1963-65. \u201cWe\u2019re really proud of it. We need some time to reflect, to deal with it, to observe, to analyze properly. But for the future, I think that some of the principles that we have sustained, those are going to be really meaningful for the future.\u201d Treble hurt However, there was little time to bask in the glory of a maiden title for Alonso. A tantalizing treble was still on the cards with two defining finals in the space of four days. Firstly, Atalanta in the Europa League followed by Kaiserslautern in the German Cup. Could Leverkusen become just the second German team in history to complete a treble after Bayern Munich? Alas, the perfect season wasn\u2019t to be. Leverkusen\u2019s historic run came to a dramatic ending in the Europa League final as Ademola Lookman\u2019s hat trick delivered the Italians their second major trophy in the club\u2019s 116-year history. Redemption, though, would be served a few days later as Granit Xhaka\u2019s strike saw Alonso and his team complete a domestic double. So close, yet so far from eternity. \u201cIt\u2019s football. The exception has been the 52 that we made. To deal with the defeat it\u2019s part of our job. It\u2019s not the first time, [and] it\u2019s not going to be the last time,\u201d a reflective Alonso said. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I have the intuition that that game [against Atalanta] will make me a better coach, better manager than if we would have won the treble. \u201cFor sure, those games you don\u2019t forget, and you can use that for the future. \u201cAt the moment, it hurts. It hurts so much, but I have that feeling that it will be more useful for my development than winning the treble.\u201d Competitive edge Perhaps the bigger feat achieved by Alonso, Leverkusen and the Bundesliga as a whole this season has been to remind the wider footballing world of the league\u2019s quality and competitiveness. Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich reached the Champions League final and semifinals alongside Leverkusen\u2019s astonishing exploits. Derided in some quarters as a \u2018Farmers League\u2019 for lacking apparent star power and marketing, Alonso believed German clubs\u2019 performances on the domestic and European stages this season give the Bundesliga a platform to entice a captive global audience and once again challenge, if not surpass, its European competitors. \u201cThere has always been that pride [in German football],\u201d said Alonso. \u201cThe league is so competitive. We know that. I know that pretty well because I have to work on a weekly basis on that! \u201cFor the whole of Europe or even the whole world to see how good the teams are, how good the players are \u2026 it\u2019s really, really important. \u201cI think that we need to push the Bundesliga to have this, not German projection, [but] this world projection. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be our biggest push for the league if we are able to be known worldwide [like] La Liga, as the Premier League\u2026 to not be left behind.\u201d So how does he believe the league goes about achieving that objective? \u201cPerforming, reaching finals, playing good football, helping spectacular players that they have an impact on the young kids in Leverkusen, in Dortmund but as well in San Francisco or in Delhi,\u201d he explains. \u201cWe have Florian Wirtz. We have [Jeremie] Frimpong. We have these young ones that they have a really good impact in these young kids that we have right now.\u201d Liverpool links It\u2019s perhaps no surprise that the Spaniard\u2019s rapid rise through the footballing ranks and achievements this season have garnered him many suitors. During the season, the 42-year-old was linked to then managerial vacancies at two of his former teams \u2013 Bayern Munich and Liverpool \u2013 jobs which have now been filled by Vincent Kompany and Arne Slot, respectively. Yet did Alonso give any consideration to the Liverpool job following J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s announcement in January that he\u2019d be stepping down at the end of the season? \u201cAll these decisions, they need to be thorough. You need to really think about them. And it was more about what I had, not what I\u2019m missing,\u201d he explained. \u201cFor sure, my bond with Liverpool is there and it\u2019s still there. So there\u2019s no, any kind of issue with that.\u201d Asked whether he\u2019d spoken to the Merseyside club, Alonso responded: \u201cThat\u2019s kind of behind the curtains.\u201d For how much longer those curtains will stay closed remains to be seen.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/sport/xabi-alonso-bayer-leverkusen-season-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "world"}}

King\u2019s College Hospital, Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 have all been affected, as have numerous primary care providers in the UK capital, a spokesperson for the National Health Service (NHS) said Tuesday. The hospitals and providers affected are all partnered with Synnovis, a company that provides lab services to the NHS. The company said Tuesday it had been hit by a ransomware attack that affected all its IT systems \u201cresulting in interruptions to many of our pathology services.\u201d Among the services most disrupted were those involving blood tests or transfusions. Oliver Dowson, 70, was prepared for an operation from 6 a.m. on June 3 at the Royal Brompton hospital \u2013 a specialist heart and lung center managed by Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 \u2013 but was told by a surgeon at about 12.30 p.m. that it would not be going ahead, the PA news agency reported. \u201cThe staff on the ward didn\u2019t seem to know what had happened, just that many patients were being told to go home and wait for a new date,\u201d he told the agency. Vanessa Welham, from Streatham in south-west London, told the PA her husband\u2019s blood test at Gracefield Gardens health centre was cancelled Monday evening and he was informed that local centers were not taking bookings for an \u201cindefinite period of time.\u201d The NHS said the attack was having \u201ca significant impact on the delivery of services\u201d at hospitals in London, but added that emergency care continues to be available. The NHS spokesperson apologized \u201cfor the inconvenience this is causing to patients and their families.\u201d \u201cWe are working urgently to fully understand the impact of the incident with the support of the government\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre and our Cyber Operations team,\u201d the spokesperson said. Ransomware attacks typically involve hackers using malicious software, or malware, to block access to a server until a ransom is paid. Attacks on the health system in the UK are relatively rare, experts say. Ciaran Martin, former head of the UK government\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre, told CNN that UK healthcare services suffered \u201ccomparatively less disruption than the US\u201d from ransomware attacks. \u201cThat\u2019s partly because so much of British healthcare is state run, and the government never pays,\u201d Martin said. \u201cBut this is an attack on a private supplier to the NHS. And it shows that the horrors of healthcare cybercrime disruption can hit these shores too.\u201d \u201cThe details are still emerging, but this seems a very serious incident with potential consequences for patient care,\u201d Martin added. Mark Dollar, the CEO of Synnovis, said the company was \u201cincredibly sorry for the inconvenience and upset this is causing to patients, service users and anyone else affected. We are doing our best to minimize the impact and will stay in touch with local NHS services to keep people up to date with developments.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/europe/cyberattack-london-hospitals-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "world"}}

Presidential aide Bayo Onanuga dismissed these demands as \u201cunreasonable,\u201d in a post on the social media platform X. The government had proposed a 100% increase to 60,000 naira ($44.89), which the unions rejected, seeking a 1,547% increase instead, Onanuga added. Despite being Africa\u2019s fourth-largest economy, Nigeria\u2019s minimum wage is not among the continent\u2019s top ten, lagging far behind countries like Seychelles, where workers receive a minimum wage of $465.4 monthly. Health care system disrupted The strike has severely affected travel, leaving passengers stranded at major airports in Lagos and Abuja. Airport workers confirmed to CNN that all incoming and outgoing flights have been grounded, further compounding the crisis. Healthcare services have also been severely impacted, a Nigerian doctor Olusina Ajidahun told CNN. \u201cI\u2019m worried because the state of the healthcare system is on the verge of collapse,\u201d he said, adding that his medical facility located in southwest Nigeria was unable to power crucial hospital equipment due to the shutdown of the national grid. \u201cComing in the morning, the emergency (unit) and everywhere was dark. Patients and healthcare workers were all in darkness.\u201d Nigerian Justice Minister Lateef Fagbemi has declared the strike illegal in a letter to the labor unions, calling it \u201cpremature and ineffectual,\u201d in a statement posted by Onanuga. The strike has elicited mixed reactions from Nigerians on social media, with some declaring support, others saying it is detrimental to citizens. \u201cI support the strike action by the NLC. 30k or 60k minimum wage in 2024 Nigeria is unsustainable and unacceptable,\u201d wrote lawyer Festus Ogun in a post on X. \u201cThe NLC should refrain from actions that punish the common man \u2013 the average Nigerian. Electricity, roads, airports and other critical infrastructure should be left to function as normal,\u201d argued management consultant Dipo Awojide. Controversial expenditure Nigeria faces numerous economic challenges, including the devaluation of its currency which has dropped to record lows in recent months, as well as a cost-of-living crisis marked by soaring prices for food, transport, and health care. Inflation has reached 33.69%, according to the country\u2019s data office, the highest in nearly three decades. President Bola Tinubu\u2019s administration has faced criticism for controversial spending of public funds which has fueled public anger. Last month, the president approved a 90 billion-naira ($67 million) subsidy for Muslims attending the Hajj pilgrimage, and previously, he authorized multimillion-dollar budgets for luxury SUVs and renovations for presidential residences, as well as vehicles for the First Lady\u2019s office, which is not formally recognized under Nigerian law. Presidential spokesman Ajuri Ngelale admitted that the current wage is \u201cunsustainably low\u201d but warned that the unions\u2019 proposed increase would have severe economic consequences, including significantly higher school fees and potential mass retrenchment if schools and other institutions cannot afford the increased wages. \u201cNigerian parents will now have to grapple with school fees that are 10 times more than what they are paying today \u2026 you are going to mandate schools to pay cooks, janitors, and others 20 times more in wages?\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/africa/nigerian-workers-declare-nationwide-strike-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_04_india_india-election-modi-victory-declaration-intl-hnk", "text": "India\u2019s\u00a0transformative yet divisive Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared victory in national elections on Tuesday evening, but his\u00a0goal of winning an unassailable majority lies in tatters with early results showing voters delivered a shock result that reduces the extent of his party\u2019s grip on power. \u201cToday is a glorious day\u2026 National Democratic Alliance (NDA) is going to form the government for the third time, we are grateful to the people,\u201d Modi told cheering supporters at his party headquarters in New Delhi, referring to the initials of his political alliance. \u201cThis is a victory for the world\u2019s largest democracy.\u201d Modi is set to form a government with the help of his NDA allies \u2013 a third consecutive term and a landmark that makes him one of the most successful politicians in post-independence India. But preliminary figures from the election commission indicate Modi\u2019s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party had fallen short of securing the 272 seats needed to win an outright majority in parliament, a stunning upset that leaves them reliant on coalition partners to form a government. This is a personal blow to Modi, who had triumphantly vowed to win a 400-seat supermajority in this year\u2019s election \u2013 and romped to victory the last two contests with a simple majority for the BJP, turning his Hindu nationalist right-wing party into an electoral juggernaut. India\u2019s opposition, who had largely been written off in the polls and by many analysts, portrayed the result as a rejection of Modi\u2019s divisive style. Rahul Gandhi, the leader of India\u2019s National Congress, said early election results showed that the \u201ccountry has unanimously and clearly\u201d stated that it does not want Modi and his party to run the country. \u201cWe do not appreciate the way they have run this country for the last 10 years so that is a huge message for Mr. Narendra Modi,\u201d he said outside his party\u2019s headquarters in New Delhi. Congress led an alliance of opposition parties that tried to topple Modi. While they look set to have failed in that task, they have dented his previous aura of electoral invincibility. Preliminary results also suggest they have chipped away at BJP seats, including in some of the ruling party\u2019s traditional strongholds. Election authorities are still counting votes and final results are expected in the coming hours. Meanwhile Indian stocks plunged Tuesday as Modi\u2019s dream of a landslide victory slipped away, raising doubts about his ability to push through more aggressive economic reforms. \u2018Sent by God\u2019 To his millions of supporters in the Hindu majority nation, 73-year-old Modi is an icon whose policies have transformed ordinary people\u2019s lives and helped realize the nascent promise of social mobility in a country once left impoverished by colonialism now embracing the 21st century with economic growth and confidence. When he ran for office in 2014, he said he was a \u201cservant\u201d to India\u2019s 1.4 billion citizens. Five years later, he positioned himself as the nation\u2019s \u201cchowkidar\u201d or \u201cwatchman,\u201d promising to guard them from all possible threats. This year, he claimed to have been sent by god, chosen by the divine to \u201crepresent all the people of India.\u201d But to many religious minorities in the diverse democracy, that final statement is both loaded and fearsome. Religious persecution and Islamophobia have increased sharply on his watch, with critics accusing him of tacitly endorsing sectarianism to bolster his party\u2019s Hindu-nationalist dreams. They say the prime minister is dragging India away from the constitutionally secular roots and transforming India into a majoritarian Hindu state, an evolution with potentially profound implications in a giant nation with a troubled history of explosive inter-communal violence. Given India\u2019s strategic position in Asia and its booming economy, Modi\u2019s victory will reverberate far beyond its borders, capturing the attention of the United States, China and Russia in particular. Washington has long seen New Delhi as a regional crucial bulwark against an increasingly assertive China. But at the same time India remains close to Moscow and has thirstily snapped up cheap Russian oil despite the invasion of Ukraine and western-led sanctions. Modi now sets his sights on deepening his transformation of India, with the goal of turning the vast country into a developed nation by 2047, the centenary of independence from colonial British rule. He inherited a rising economy and India\u2019s growth remains impressive, filled with a populous young workforce. But that same workforce is also chronically underemployed, with youth unemployment spiraling and much of the country\u2019s growing wealth distributed unequally. From April 19 to June 1, more than 640 million people cast their vote at polling stations across the country, from the high peaks of the Himalayas to the remote jungles of the west. And though turnout slightly dipped from the record levels of 2019, that a democratically elected leader won a third term speaks to his levels of popularity. \u201cNo one can do for us what our Prime Minister Modi can,\u201d said BJP worker Rajgopal Kashyap, from the party\u2019s headquarters in New Delhi. \u201cHe has come to us as an instrument of God. He will take our country forward and is the only one who can run the country.\u201d No modern Indian politician has been able to establish the cult-like following that Modi has. At his rallies, tens of thousands gather in religious devotion to glimpse a man they say they hope never loses his grip on power. His face is plastered on buses and billboards across the country, and his voice enters the homes of millions every month via his flagship radio program and increasingly pliant media landscape. \u201cLook at the way he has projected his personality,\u201d his unofficial biographer Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay told CNN. \u201cVery finely manicured, (someone) who exudes power. He is a very performative political leader. He is no less than a rock star on the stage.\u201d Supporters say he is the best person to cement the country\u2019s rank as a major global player. \u201cFor us middle-class people, (Prime Minister Narendra Modi) is the only one who has done anything, who has shined India\u2019s name abroad,\u201d said Surjeet Singh, a driver in New Delhi. Political scientist Christophe Jaffrelot says such sentiment \u201ccan be seen across the board.\u201d There\u2019s a feeling that Modi makes Indians \u201cproud again,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a sense in India of vulnerability, lack of self-esteem. So, to be recognized as a great power despite everything is attributed to him.\u201d \u2018We won\u2019t be safe\u2019 Modi projects himself as an outsider from humble origins. The son of a tea seller from a small town in Gujarat state, his story, his colleagues say, resonates with millions. \u201cHe comes from a poor background and that helps him understands the people of India,\u201d Varanasi BJP president Dileep Patel previously told CNN. Over the last decade his administration has upgraded the country\u2019s aging transport network, building highways to connect small villages with major cities. He has overseen the development of new power plants and maritime projects and, according to recent remarks from Modi himself, subsidized the construction of some 40 million concrete homes for improvised families. His decade in power has not been without controversy. Modi faced widespread criticism early in his tenure when he banned India\u2019s 500 and 1,000 rupee bank notes, deeming them \u201cworthless pieces of paper,\u201d sparking panic in the cash heavy economy. In 2019, he faced the wrath of angry farmers when they took to the streets to demand guaranteed prices for their crops in the biggest protests the country has ever seen. Two years later, critics blamed him for mismanaging the country\u2019s response to the Covid-19 pandemic, which led to more than half a million deaths, according to official figures. And for some observers, a troubling, divisive pattern has also emerged through the years. Another five years of Modi, said Congress supporter Sunita Gautam, will be \u201chorrible plight for women\u201d and minorities. \u00a0\u00a0\u201cWe won\u2019t be safe. It\u2019s horrible for Muslims. It\u2019s horrible for Dalits. Who is it good for?\u201d she asked. \u201cModi promised employment for youth but look at the number of people unemployed.\u201d This breaking news story has been updated.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/india/india-election-modi-victory-declaration-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_04_middleeast_israel-assault-bureij-gaza-intl-latam", "text": "The Israeli military launched a new ground and air assault in central Gaza on Tuesday, as its forces ramp up attacks amid a deepening humanitarian crisis. The IDF claimed Tuesday afternoon local time that fighter jets were attacking Hamas targets in the Bureij area \u201cat the same time as ground forces that are operating in a targeted manner and with intelligence guidance,\u201d in the same area. CNN cannot independently verify the IDF\u2019s statement. The Ministry of Health in Gaza said that 15 people had been killed and dozens injured during the Israeli operation, with the casualties occurring east of the Bureij and Al-Maghazi displacement camps. It said the local Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital was overwhelmed with admissions. A CNN producer in the area said that at least six bodies had been brought to the hospital, along with more than 30 injured people. Among those killed were a father and his 12-year-old son, when an artillery shell hit an apartment building east of Al Bureij, according to the CNN producer, as well as a boy and a girl. A woman in her 20s was also killed. The ministry said the number of patients was more than three times the hospital\u2019s normal capacity and that it was unable to bear receiving more martyrs and injuries in light of this dangerous aggression against civilians, children and women.\u201d It called on the World Health Organization to visit the hospital. Witnesses say civilians started to leave the Bureij area \u2013 heading towards the coast \u2013 after military activity there intensified. Another CNN producer reported tank-fire in recent days from the east-west Netzarim corridor that the IDF has carved through central Gaza towards neighborhoods south of Gaza city. He said there had been a limited ground incursion in the same neighborhoods over the past three days. News of the latest assault comes as the former Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett told CNN the war with Hamas had lost momentum and that Israel should pressure Hamas by pushing on with its controversial operations in Gaza\u2019s southernmost city of Rafah. \u201cWe need to act much quicker. This whole war is going on way too long. We could\u2019ve done Rafah three, four months ago. I think a combination of poor execution of the Israeli government and the American administration\u2019s constant slowing down of Israel coupled together made for a very slow and prolonged war,\u201d Bennett told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper. He said that prolonging the war is what Hamas wants, and the only way to get a ceasefire and hostage deal on the table is to put more pressure on Hamas and push harder in Rafah, adding that operations there have not concluded. He said Israel is \u201cpaying an international price\u201d as other countries criticize the war\u2019s humanitarian toll. \u201cWe are trying to conduct the most just war in history,\u201d Bennett said, but \u201ceverybody in the world is double-guessing and telling us how to do it and how they would do it better, but they\u2019re not in our shoes, and we have to defend our citizens first.\u201d Israel launched its military offensive in Gaza on October 7 after the militant group Hamas, which governs Gaza, killed at least 1,200 people and abducted more than 250 others. Israeli attacks in Gaza have since killed at least\u00a036,550\u00a0Palestinians and injured another\u00a082,959\u00a0people, according to the Ministry of Health there. CNN cannot independently confirm the figures.

{"id": "travel_article_best-nude-beaches-world", "text": "2024 is already shaping up to be another banner year for nudity around the world with a nude cruise and nude beach weddings on the horizon. Earlier this year, tour and travel company Bare Necessities announced an 11-day voyage from Miami to the Caribbean in collaboration with Norwegian Cruise Line. It\u2019s due to set sail in February 2025. With stopovers in the Bahamas and Puerto Rico, \u201cThe Big Nude Boat\u201d is billed as a \u201conce in a lifetime experience\u201d with amenities designed to \u201cfit everyone\u2019s style of bare cruising.\u201d  And couples will soon be able to tie the knot sans clothes at Is Benas Beach in Sardinia, which has a naturist-designated area. The news was confirmed in May by Luigi Tedeschi, mayor of San Vero Milis, the closest town to the beach. \u201cNudity has nothing to do with sex. For [naturists], it\u2019s a philosophy of life, and is linked to nature,\u201d Tedeschi said. \u201cIt should be respected \u2013 so why not?\u201d Meanwhile, there are more places than ever to sun, swim or build sandcastles au naturel at clothing-optional beaches around the world.  From rocky coastlines to talcum-powder fine sands and big city bays to secluded shores, there are now hundreds of beaches where it\u2019s perfectly legal (or at least de facto legal) to frolic beside the sea in nothing more than your birthday suit.   \u201cSoft, smooth sand, warm ocean breeze, gentle ocean waves and lots of other naturists makes for a great clothing-optional beach,\u201d says Nicky Hoffman of The Naturist Society, who\u2019s also the managing editor of Nude & Natural magazine and co-author of \u201cThe World\u2019s Best Nude Beaches & Resorts.\u201d  While clothing-optional beach destinations may seem like a modern invention, it\u2019s actually quite an old idea, a product of the otherwise prudish Victorian era. During the 1880s, American poet Walt Whitman extolled the virtues of the \u201cAdamic air bath\u201d \u2013 his nude walkabouts and swims along Timber Creek in New Jersey, writing of \u201cthe free exhilarating ecstasy of nakedness in Nature.\u201d Channeling that same vibe, the naturist movement took off in Europe and North America during the first half of the 20th century, with city parks, camp grounds and eventually beaches established for those who wanted to experience nature nude in their most natural state.  One of the spin-offs of the socially and sexually liberal 1960s was a \u201cfree beach\u201d movement that saw a proliferation of nude beaches around the world. And their popularity continues today, with more and more popping up each year. Here are 24 of the best nude beaches you can visit around the world in 2024:  Playa Naturista Chihuahua, Uruguay  Located about a 30-minute drive from Punta del Este, Uruguay\u2019s best-known nude beach overlooks Portezuelo Bay on the Atlantic coast.  Photogenic dunes and water temperatures that reach 25 Celsius (77 F) and higher even in the Southern Hemisphere winter add to the strand\u2019s allure.     After decades as an unofficial naked getaway, Chihuahua finally achieved legal status in 2000.  Since then, amenities have expanded to include the Hotel El Refugio Nudista Naturista clothing-optional resort. Playa Naturista Chihuahua, Avenida Las Amarras, 20003 Chihuahua, Uruguay   Nida Nude Beach, Lithuania The chilly Baltic Sea may not seem like the most obvious place to skinny dip. But this gorgeous strand on the long, sandy Curonian Spit offers one of Europe\u2019s most picturesque spots to take it all off. With its wildflower-covered dunes (among the highest in Europe) and shoreline forest, the beach was the focus of a 19th-century artists\u2019 colony that attracted many of the leading painters, poets and writers of the time.  Walk far enough south along the strand and you eventually come to a fence that marks the Lithuania-Russia border.  Nida Nude Beach, Nidos-Smiltyn\u0117s pl., Nida, Lithuania Agesta Beach, Sweden Sweden may be home to many beaches where nudity is accepted, but Agesta Beach, located roughly 15 kilometers (9 miles) south of Stockholm, is its only official nude beach.  Based in the southern end of the lake Magelungen, Agesta Beach\u2019s sandy shores are popular with locals as well as visitors looking for an escape from the bustling capital city. Open from May to September, this beach is very well looked after, with picnic tables, BBQ areas, public bathrooms and play areas for children available. Agesta Beach, Huddinge, Sweden Little Palm Beach, Waiheke, New Zealand  Although it\u2019s technically legal to go naked on any beach in personal-liberty-loving New Zealand, the nation\u2019s naturists tend to congregate at well-known clothing-optional spots like Little Palm Beach on Waiheke Island.  Reaching the secluded strand entails a 40-to-60-minute ferry ride from Auckland, a taxi or rideshare to the island\u2019s north shore, and then a short downhill hike.  You can top or tail your beach adventure at Waiheke\u2019s many wineries, restaurants, and art galleries.    Little Palm Beach, Miro Road, Waiheke Island 1081, New Zealand   Nugal Beach, Croatia Flanked by sheer cliffs and shades by pine trees, this remote beach on the mainland opposite Bra\u010d island is reached via a narrow path that seems ready made for goats rather than people seeking an apparel-free escape on the Adriatic.   Be sure to bring a thick towel or even a beach chair \u2014 like many Croatian beaches the surface is pebbles rather than sand.  Nugal is about a half-an-hour walk from the nearest town, although it can also be reached by boat or sea kayak from Makarska or Tu\u010depi. Nugal Beach, 21300 Makarska, Croatia   Moshup Beach, Martha\u2019s Vineyard, Massachusetts Perched at the island\u2019s western extreme, Moshup is a long curving strand that wraps around a headline crowned by the historic Gay Head Lighthouse (built in 1799).  Located right below the ancient light, the clothing optional portion lies beneath rust-colored sandstone cliffs that were declared a National Natural Monument in 1966.  Moshup is open free of charge to anyone who wants to take their clothes off, as opposed to Lucy Vincent, the island\u2019s private nude beach.    Moshup Beach, 71 Moshup Trail, Aquinnah, MA 02535  Black\u2019s Beach, La Jolla, California Set beneath the high cliffs of Torrey Pines, Blacks has been the Golden State\u2019s favorite place for all-over tans for more than 50 years and was once the only legal nude beach in the entire United States.  Long, wide and blessed with great surf, the beach is reached via the zig-zag Ho Chi Minh Trail from La Jolla Farms Road or the Citizens Trail from Torrey Pines Gliderport near the University of California, San Diego. Black\u2019s Beach, Torrey Pines Scenic Drive, San Diego, CA 92037 Lady Bay Beach, Sydney, Australia  Although it sometimes seems like just about any beach in Australia is clothing optional, there are a number of official nude beaches here such as Lady Bay. (also known as Lady Jane Beach.)  Perched just inside the South Head of Sydney Harbour, it\u2019s small and narrow, but incredibly secluded for such a big city location.  The rocky ledges around South Head are also used for nude sunbathing.  Lady Bay Beach, Watson\u2019s Bay, Sydney, Australia Buhne 16, Sylt, Germany \u201cGrin and bare it\u201d might well be the motto for nudists on this North Sea island, where the average water temperature in summer is a chilly 17 C (63 F).  Technically all of the beaches on Sylt are clothing optional, but Buhne 16 was the first and is still the foremost location for nude sunbathing along the German shore.   It\u2019s a place where beachgoers can chill in the famous blue and white striped wicker beach chairs or let it all hang out at summer beach parties.  Buhne 16, Listlandstr 133b, 25980 Kampen (Sylt), German Wreck Beach, Vancouver, Canada Billed as one of the world\u2019s longest nude beaches at 7.8 kilometers (4.9 miles) long, Wreck Beach is actually a series of sandy strands, pebble flats and rocky outcrops wrapped around the end of Point Grey.  With the University of British Columbia just across the street, a steady stream of students and teachers have shed their clothes on this beach since the early 1970s, when it first became popular.  Evergreen trees along the shore and snowcapped peaks across the water complement the Canadian ambiance.  Wreck Beach, Vancouver, British Columbia; Canada Red Beach, Crete, Greece This secluded shore on the south side of Crete is a hotspot for nude sunbathing in Greece.  Named after its ocher-colored sand and cliffs, Red Beach (or Kokkini Ammos) is reached via a 20-minute hike from Matala or a very short boat ride from the village waterfront. Pioneered by Euro hippies during the 1960s, the beach offers chair and umbrella rentals and is home to a funky little bar called Yianni\u2019s that\u2019s renowned for its mojitos.  Note: the mysterious rock carvings at the end of the beach are a modern creation and definitely not ancient Minoan relics.    Red Beach, Matala, Crete 702 00, Greece  Callantsoog Beach, Netherlands Callantsoog is the oldest nudist beach in the Netherlands, having been officially recognized as a nudist beach since 1973.  Situated 60 kilometers (37 miles) north of Amsterdam, near the coastal town of Callantsoog, this beautiful stretch of sand enjoys Blue Flag status and is a great place to spot seals.  Its designated nudist section is marked between two poles. Those keen to get even closer to nature can pay a visit to the nearby Zwanenwater, a protected nature reserve and home to the largest natural dune lakes in Europe. Callantsoog Beach, Strandslag Dorpsplein, 1759 Callantsoog, Netherlands Anse de Grande Saline, St. Barts While the Caribbean may be full of wonderful, chilled out beaches, this wild, white sand strand on the rear side of St. Barts is one of the few places on the islands where public nudity is tolerated (although sunbathing naked is technically prohibited in St. Barts.) Anse de Grande Saline (or Saline Beach) is another self-catering beach. Visitors will need to bring along everything they need for a day at the shore, especially sunscreen, as there is no shade to speak of.  L\u2019Esprit, an excellent French restaurant, is within walking distance of Grand Saline and well worth a visit. Just make sure to put your clothes back on before heading over. Anse de Grande Saline, St. Barth\u00e9lemy Platja des Cavallet, Ibiza, Spain Set between the deep blue Mediterranean and multicolored salt pans near Ibiza\u2019s southernmost point, official nudist beach Es Cavallet is separated into various different sections, including a beach club party section, a gay scene and a more secluded, middle section where the clothing-free crowd hang out.  However nude sunbathers aren\u2019t the only beings who frequent this area. Those bright pink things you\u2019ll see pacing in the background aren\u2019t sunburned tourists, but rather flamingos that like to gather in the shallow salines.    Platja des Cavallet, 07818, Balearic Islands, Spain Little Beach, Maui, Hawaii Flanked by ancient lava flows and backed by a volcanic cinder cone, Little Beach would be super-cool even if you couldn\u2019t take your clothes off.  Part of Makena State Park on the island\u2019s southeast coast, it overlooks a national marine sanctuary renowned for its sea turtles, dolphins, whales and tropical fish.  Gnarled trees behind the sand provide a modicum of shade and the cove is well protected for swimming.  Additionally, a drum circle and fire dancers entertain the crowd during Sunday sunsets. Little Beach, Makena State Park, Makena Rd, Kihei, HI 96753, USA Cap d\u2019Agde beach, France Sometimes called the \u201cNaked City,\u201d Cap d\u2019Agde Naturist Village is the world\u2019s largest clothing-optional beach resort, attracting as many as 40,000 guests on any given day during high season. Visitors are free to be naked wherever they want \u2013 restaurants and stores, post offices or banks, sailing their boat or lounging on the long public beach (where nudity is obligatory, even for those not staying at the resort).  Non residents can stay overnight at the naturist hotel, camp ground or rental units.  Cap d\u2019Agde Naturist Village, Rond-Point du Bagnas, 34300 Agde, France Is Benas Beach, Sardinia, Italy Situated along Sardinia\u2019s west coast close to the town of San Vero Milis, Is Benas is known for its remoteness and pristine environment. The idyllic beach has had a partially hidden naturist-designated area for the past two years. Mayor Luigi Tedeschi of nearby San Vero Milis recently confirmed that local authorities had given the go ahead for couples to say their vows there au naturel at Is Benas in the future. \u201cWe have this beach, a place that lends itself brilliantly to naturism,\u201d Tedeschi told CNN. \u201cAnd then we thought, let\u2019s make a beach for weddings. If people want to marry nude, they can.\u201d The beach is right next to the more famous Is Arenas Beach, while the ruins of Tharros, a Roman city dominating a thin peninsula, can also be found nearby. Is Benas Beach, Province of Oristano, Sardinia, Italy Mpenjati Beach, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa  South Africa\u2019s only official nude beach \u2013 and perhaps the only legal clothing-not-obligatory strand on the entire African continent \u2013 is located in the Mpenjati Nature Reserve south of Durban.  Its legal status was achieved in 2014, but this came with a list of prohibitions including no staring, no photography, no suggestive behavior, etc.  Local clergy and others continue to mount protests (legal and otherwise) against the naked designation. Mpenjati Nature Reserve, Palm Beach, Port Edward, South Africa Playa Zipolite, Oaxaca, Mexico  Live your \u201cY Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambi\u00e9n\u201d fantasies at the beach where so many of the scenes from the sensuous 2001 Mexican movie starring Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal were shot on location. Pioneered by Mexican and American hippies during the 1960s, the strand stretches about two kilometers with rocky bluffs at either end, and is famed as a clothing-optional beach (although it isn\u2019t legal here.) While the main beach here is backed by budget hotels and cafes, a tiny sliver of sand at the eastern end called Playa del Amor offers far more privacy. Playa Zipolite, San Pedro Pochutla, Oaxaca, Mexico  Metsoke Dragot, Israel Float nude in the warm, ultra-buoyant salty water and smear your entire naked body with soothing, mineral-infused black mud at this rocky beach on the western shore of the Dead Sea.  Perhaps the only place in the Middle East where any kind of public nudity is tolerated, Metsoke Dragot is located about an hour\u2019s drive from Jerusalem and requires a short but rough drive along an unpaved road to reach the shoreline. Primitive camping is aloud along the shore. The only nearby hotel and bar is the cliff top Metzoke Dragot Travelers Village.

A two-hour drive north of Salvador, the nude beach is about a one-kilometer walk from the parking lot along the shoreline flanked by coconut palms, rolling dunes and very surfable waves.  Praia Massarandupi\u00f3, Bahia, Brazil  Spiaggia di Guvano, Vernazza, Italy  Located on the gorgeous Cinque Terre, this primo Italian nude beach looks like something out of a movie (think \u201cSwept Away \u201d \u2013 the 1974 version directed by Lina Wertm\u00fcller.) Adding to the beach\u2019s mystique is the fact that it can only be reached via kayak or motorboat or hiking down a steep and somewhat treacherous trail that involves scrambling over rocks.  Guvano is totally primitive, with no facilities of any kind, so bear this in mind when planning your visit. The beach is also pebble rather than sand, but the water is clear, clean and gorgeous.

Based close to the capital city of Riga and a relatively short walk from Vecaki train station, it\u2019s known for its shimmering waters, stunning sunsets and of course, its nudist section. The zone, which happens to be the biggest nudist beach area in the country, includes a beach volleyball area that\u2019s a big hit with local residents.

{"id": "2024_06_03_asia_shangrila-dialogue-china-trump-intl-hnk", "text": "Any tourist wandering through the glitzy lobby of Singapore\u2019s Shangri-La Hotel this weekend would have stumbled on a rather bizarre scene. Military officers from around the world thronged the halls of the luxury hotel, their shoulders dripping with gold braids and epaulets, complicated colored bars lined up on the chests of their dress uniforms like some martial game of Tetris. Every few minutes a defense minister strode purposely through the mix, surrounded by a phalanx of aides and escorts. This gathering is an annual spectacle that to the uninitiated might seem surreal. But the topics being discussed here are deadly serious. The annual Shangri-La Dialogue is one of the few places in the world where you can watch warriors who spend their careers preparing for armed conflict, engaged in polite, carefully-moderated debate. The stakes this year could hardly be higher. War rages in both the Middle East and Europe. Meanwhile China\u2019s increasingly assertive moves has much of the Asia-Pacific on edge. The Singapore summit brought key players together. Where else would you have the President of the Philippines, a nation whichdo has seen its vessels increasingly targeted by Chinese coast guard ships in the disputed South China Sea, deliver a keynote address on the same stage that, two days later, Beijing\u2019s new Defense Minister makes his debut appearance? There was even a surprise appearance from Ukraine\u2019s embattled president Volodymyr Zelensky \u2013 and a first face-to-face meeting between US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and his Chinese counterpart Adm Dong Jun. Given its location in the city-state of Singapore, events in Asia \u2013 and in particular China\u2019s behavior in the region \u2013 stalked the conference. In his keynote speech, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. issued a stark warning about the ongoing confrontations between Philippine and China Coast Guard vessels in a contested part of the South China Sea. \u201cIf a Filipino citizen is killed by a willful act,\u201d he said, \u201cthat is I think, very, very close to what we define as an act of war.\u201d Two days later, China\u2019s Adm Dong fired back from the same stage, accusing the Philippines of \u201cblackmail\u201d in the maritime dispute. \u201cThere is a limit to our restraint,\u201d said Admiral Dong Jun. \u201cI saw that as a threat,\u201d said Dewi Fortuna Anwar, a research professor at Indonesia\u2019s National Research and Innovation Center who has been attending the Shangri-La Dialogue since its founding twenty-one years ago. \u201cIn decades past, the Chinese only came in a small number and they were extremely quiet,\u201d she said.\u00a0 \u201cNow they\u2019re very self confident\u2026they intervene in all the sessions.\u201d The open nature of the Shangri-La Dialogue provides delegates with a unique opportunity to ask blunt questions of speakers. After his speech on Sunday, China\u2019s Dong received many questions from audience members on Beijing\u2019s increased threats towards self-governing Taiwan as well as its disputed claims in the South China Sea, and he replied in unapologetic terms. The \u201cseparatists\u201d in Taiwan\u2019s newly-elected government would\u00a0be \u201cnailed to the pillar of shame in history,\u201d he said. But equally, Chinese military officers also used Q&A sessions at other key moments to make their views known. Senior Colonel Yanzhong Cao of China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army asked US Secretary of Defense asked US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin whether the US was trying to build a NATO-like alliance in the Asia-Pacific region, adding the claim \u201cthe eastward expansion of NATO has led to the Ukraine crisis.\u201d \u201cI respectfully disagree,\u201d Austin replied, the audience in the ballroom then erupting into a rare burst of applause. \u201cThe Ukraine crisis obviously was caused because Mr. Putin made a decision to unlawfully invade his neighbor,\u201d Austin continued. \u201cThis was brought on because of a decision by Mr. Putin.\u201d Later that day, Ukrainian leader Zelensky got a borderline rock star welcome when he made a surprise appearance at the conference, dressed in his trademark fatigues and black t-shirt. \u201cWe stand with you,\u201d Ng Eng Hen, Singapore\u2019s minister of defense, later said to Zelensky. But the large contingent of Chinese army officers present at other sessions was notably absent during Zelensky\u2019s speech and the Ukrainian leader said he failed to secure a one-on-one meeting with Chinese officials during his Singapore visit. He also accused Beijing of aiding Ukraine\u2019s mortal enemy. \u201cWith China\u2019s support to Russia, the war will last longer.\u00a0\u00a0That is bad for the whole world, and the policy of China \u2013 who declares that it supports territorial integrity and sovereignty and declares it officially. For them it is not good,\u201d Zelensky told journalists. It was not clear whether Zelensky succeeded in securing new support for Kyiv from non-aligned south-east Asian countries like Malaysia and Indonesia. Instead, Indonesian president-elect and retired general Prabowo Subianto \u2013 the new leader of the world\u2019s most populous Muslim majority nation \u2013 spent much of his speech calling for an end to the on-going carnage in Gaza and an investigation into recent Israeli attacks that killed dozens of displaced civilians in Rafah. Another political elephant in the room was what direction might the United States be heading in. The Singapore gathering began just hours after a 12-person jury in a court-room in New York City\u00a0convicted former US President Donald Trump on of all 34 counts of falsifying business records in his hush money criminal trial. Asia is watching very closely for whether Trump will return to office in November and what impact that might have on the world\u2019s most populous continent and a region already fraught with very real geopolitical fault lines. In a sign of clear discomfort with the news,\u00a0a US lawmaker Michael McCaul, Chairman from the House Foreign Affairs Committee, abruptly cancelled filming a previously scheduled interview with CNN. His fellow Republican Senator Dan Sullivan also requested not to discuss Trump during a meeting with journalists, instead directing reporters to a press release. \u201cThis is a very sad day for American and the rule of law,\u201d Sullivan\u2019s statement said, calling the verdict a \u201cgross abuse of our justice system.\u201d But speaking to journalists, the Senator from Alaska also celebrated what he called America\u2019s \u201ccommitment to liberty and democracy,\u201d saying this marked a competitive advantage over \u201cauthoritarian aggression led by China, Russia, Iran and North Korea.\u201d Sullivan was part of a bi-partisan delegation seeking to demonstrate Congressional commitment to US allies in Asia. \u201cThe dictators we are allied against\u2026are ally poor,\u201d Sullivan said. But there are clearly concerns about US reliability. An academic from Japan \u2013 Washington\u2019s closest ally in Asia \u2013 asked defense chiefs from Singapore and Malaysia about Trump\u2019s possible re-election.\u00a0 He called it a \u201cnightmare\u201d scenario. That triggered nervous laughter from the audience and on stage. Singapore\u2019s Dr. Ng Eng Hen gamely responded, \u201cwe will work with any administration in any country if we can find common ground.\u201d I vividly remember collective nervousness at the 2017 Shangri-La Dialogue, held just months after Trump\u2019s inauguration. Trump\u2019s then secretary of defense James Mattis clearly sought to reassure American defense partners worried about the new mercurial president. \u201cBear with us,\u201d Mattis told the audience, after being asked whether the \u201cAmerica First\u201d commander-in-chief would contribute to the destruction of the post-World War II order. \u201cOnce we\u2019ve exhausted all possible alternatives, the Americans will do the right thing.\u00a0 We will still be there.\u201d Seven years later, uncertainty over the political future of the US is just one of many challenges facing policy makers. One by one, the leaders of armies and navies shared their fears about climate change, nuclear proliferation, wars in Europe and the Middle East and concerns that a miscalculation between the US and Chinese militaries could spiral out of control \u201cThe world cannot withstand a third geopolitical shock,\u201d Singaporean defense chief Dr. Ng warned, after invoking the Gaza and Ukraine conflicts. In this tense geopolitical environment, it\u2019s far better for commanders to put on their dress uniforms and rub shoulders in the halls of a five-star hotel, than aim at each other over gun barrels on the battlefield.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/asia/shangrila-dialogue-china-trump-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_30_asia_japan-whaling-mothership-kangei-maru-intl-hnk", "text": "Wearing a toy whale hat, whale tie and a whale motif shirt, Hideki Tokoro spends much of his days thinking about the world\u2019s largest mammals. But he doesn\u2019t want to protect them. He wants to hunt them. To do that his company Kyodo Senpaku has built and launched a brand-new whaling $48 million \u201cmothership\u201d \u2013 the Kangei Maru. \u201cWe are proud of catching whales and are very proud of this ship which will allow us to begin offshore mothership-style whaling this year,\u201d Tokoro told reporters as he escorted them around the 370-foot, 9,300-ton vessel that set sail last Saturday for an eight-month tour of the country\u2019s northern waters. The new ship replaces the Nisshin Maru, the infamous whaling factory vessel dubbed by activists as a \u201cfloating slaughterhouse\u201d that was decommissioned in 2020 after more than 30 years of service, during which it frequently clashed with anti-whaling activists. The Kangei Maru is bigger and faster than its predecessor, the company says, and is equipped with state-of-the-art drones able to travel a reported 100 kilometers (62 miles) to allow crews of smaller boats to quickly locate and kill whales. But activists say the ship\u2019s high-powered features, including a cruising range of 13,000 kilometers (more than 8,000 miles) and its ability to sail for up to 60 days, suggests that Japan is setting its sights on whales far beyond its northern waters. \u201cJapan has never given up on its whaling ambitions,\u201d veteran anti-whaling activist Paul Watson told CNN. \u201cThe only purpose of a vessel like that is so it can travel long distances to the Southern Ocean to hunt whales, (and) what the whalers are doing right now is really just a test run. They are testing out the new ship in their waters.\u201d \u2018We need to cull whales\u2019 The Kangei Maru boasts a slipway large enough to haul 85-foot whales from the sea that leads to an indoor flensing deck the size\u00a0of two basketball courts. There, workers will strip away the blubber before cutting up the whale flesh on enormous cutting boards, before vacuum-packing and storing the meat in 40 industrial freezers, ready for sale. \u201cWhales are at the top of the food chain. They compete with humans by eating marine creatures that should be feeding other fish,\u201d Tokoro said on the tour. \u201cWe need to cull whales to keep the balance of the ecosystem \u2013 it\u2019s our job and mission to protect oceans for the future.\u201d He also told CNN that most of the ship\u2019s catch would be killed \u201calmost instantly\u201d by cannons at sea. \u201cWe aim for perfection, but some of them may suffer. In such cases, we will use a rifle to finish the job.\u201d Besides objecting to the slaughter one of the ocean\u2019s most majestic creatures, marine conservation groups and scientists have highlighted the important role which whales play in helping to tackle the climate crisis through sequestering and storing planet-heating carbon emissions. \u201cWhales are not just consumers in ocean eco-systems \u2013 they recycle a ton of nutrients into the environment which helps stimulate plant-life growth,\u201d\u00a0said marine ecologist Ari Friedlaender, also rejecting pro-whaling arguments that commercial hunts could be \u201csustainable.\u201d \u201cHumans have a very long history of killing whales and have not done a good job of being able to sustainably harvest animals,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no way to sustainably harvest a wild animal like that.\u201d Why is Japan so determined to keep whaling? Commercial whaling was banned in 1986 under a moratorium by the International Whaling Commission (IWC) after whale populations were almost driven to extinction by humans. Japan is one of three countries \u2013 along with Norway and Iceland \u2013 that continues to hunt whales, and officials argue that the industry is an important part of its culture and history \u2013 and also provides food security. Iceland, which has fiercely defended commercial whaling, said it would end whaling in 2024, citing falling demand for whale meat as well as \u201chigh operation costs and little proof of any economic advantage.\u201d Commercial whaling continues in Norway, which experts say has quietly become the world\u2019s leading whaling nation \u2013 killing more whales than Japan and Iceland combined. For decades, Japan has justified whaling under the guise of \u201cscientific research.\u201d In 2018, it tried one last time to persuade the IWC to allow it to resume commercial whaling \u2013 and failed. So, it withdrew from the body and resumed commercial whaling months later, in defiance of international criticism. \u201cJapan is no longer party to the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling and can argue that it is no longer bound by provisions and constraints,\u201d Donald Rothwell, an international law professor at the Australian National University (ANU), told CNN. \u201cWithin its waters, it\u00a0has the absolute authority to control the management of living resources \u2013 and that includes whales.\u201d Under Japanese law, three species of whale are permitted to be hunted in its territorial waters and exclusive economic zones \u2013 endangered sei whales and threatened minke whales and Bryde\u2019s whales, with endangered fin whales set to be added to kill lists. \u201cWhales are important food resources and should be sustainably utilized based on scientific evidence,\u201d said government spokesperson Yoshimasa Hayashi this month, as he announced a proposal to hunt fin whales, the second-largest species of whales after blue whales. The World Cetacean Alliance (WCA) marine conservation group said that whale watching in Japan was \u201ca far more successful industry\u201d than harvesting whale meat. \u201cCommercial whaling in the 21st century is unjustifiable,\u201d it said. \u00a0\u201cThe whaling industry in Japan recognizes that it is a challenge to increase whale meat consumption and there is currently no market,\u201d WCA said. \u201cSo why keep slaughtering these wonderful and intelligent animals?\u201d Tokoro ruled out whale watching. \u201cWe will not switch to whale watching but eating whale meat while watching whales might be quite a nice touch,\u201d he told CNN. Demand for whale meat in Japan Over the years, Kyodo Senpaku has launched aggressive public relation campaigns to promote whale meat and win over new generations of young diners. Tokoro says he eats whale meat every day. \u201cWhale meat is not only delicious, it\u2019s good for you,\u201d Tokoro told reporters during the tour of his ship, as he talked\u00a0up the purported \u201chealth benefits\u201d of eating whale, claiming that the meat could cure hair loss and cancer. \u201cI can definitely say whale meat and rice is a really good (combination) for Japanese people. There is no doubt about that, much better than beef and bun.\u201d Last year Tokoro, again wearing his whale hat, launched controversial whale meat vending machines, offering whale sashimi, whale steak and whale bacon. The company has also sponsored influencers from countries such as Russia, Thailand and South Korea \u2013 hosting them at a local izakaya in Osaka, where they sampled dishes like whale sashimi and skewers and encouraging them to take the message back to their followers that whale meat was delicious and acceptable. Japan may have a long and storied history of whaling dating back to the Edo period in the 1600s, but experts say whale meat consumption only really peaked after World War II \u2013 when food sources, especially protein, were scarce. Today, whale meat is now\u00a0considered more of a \u201cluxury\u201d dish, said Nobuhiro Kishigami, a professor at the National Museum of Ethnology, one of the country\u2019s largest research institutes. \u201cThe fact is that there is little interest in whaling and whale meat among Japanese people as a whole,\u201d Kishigami told CNN. \u201cMost young people, especially the majority that live in cities, do not know or care much about whaling and its history and remain indifferent.\u201d The same goes for dolphin meat, he added. \u201cIt\u2019s just a sign of the times. But if we were asked to stop eating blue fin tuna, there would be a huge uproar. We would react very badly to that.\u201d Japan\u2019s fisheries ministry estimates that between 1,000 and 2,000 tons of whale meat are consumed annually in the country, compared to average annual totals of more than 230,000 tons during the 1960s. \u201cThere is still certainly a market (for whale meat in Japan) but market size and production volume have shrunk dramatically,\u201d economics professor Mitsuhiro Kishimoto from the Shimonoseki City University told CNN, noting that several major whaling companies had since withdrawn from the trade. \u201cThe demand for whale blubber disappeared after the discovery of oil and petroleum products, so many countries stopped whaling and with international regulations, the number of caught whales decreased and as a result, whale meat production decreased while beef, pork and chicken became more popular,\u201d he said. Scientists have also expressed\u00a0concern about the risks of consuming whale meat, with studies pointing to high levels of mercury found in whale and dolphin meat, which could prove dangerous to consumers \u2013 especially pregnant women and young children. Could Japanese whalers return to the Southern Ocean? Located in deep waters surrounding the entire continent of Antarctica, the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary hosts dozens of whale species including humpbacks, blue whales and fin whales. It was established by the IWC in 1994 to protect whale species after centuries of hunting, but until 2019 Japan took regular trips to the region to hunt for self-stated \u201cscientific research\u201d purposes. Japanese whalers killed 333 minke whales in the Southern Ocean in 2018/2019, according to the IWC, before abandoning the region after it left the international body. Takaaki Sakamoto, director of the Whaling Affairs Office in Japan\u2019s Fisheries Agency, told CNN that Japan sent ships to the Antarctic last year to collect numbers and skin surface samples, but those expeditions did not involve killing whales. He said they planned to return this year to do the same. Tokoro told CNN that the Kangei Maru is not planning on killing whales beyond Japanese waters because it doesn\u2019t make economic sense. \u201cCommercial whaling is not profitable,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will take 50 days to get to the Antarctic and back and we are not confident we can make a profit by paying the wages of employees and fuel for 50 days. However, I will go only when the government orders me to go \u2026 Until then, I will not go commercial whaling at all.\u201d But\u00a0activists aren\u2019t convinced. \u201cGiven the ship\u2019s long-range capabilities and drones, and recent announcements from Japan\u2019s fisheries ministry that it is keen to start hunting fin whales, we believe there is a high likelihood that Japanese whalers will return to the Southern Ocean,\u201d said James Anderson, activist and founder of the Whale Defense Agency (WDA). \u201cThe Southern Ocean is a critical habitat for many whale species that provides a safe haven for breeding and feeding \u2026 protecting it is more important than ever due to the increasing threats posed by climate change and illegal whaling.\u201d Rothwell, from ANU, said that if Japan looks to kill whales beyond its territorial waters, it can expect an international response. \u201cIt would immediately trigger global interest and action about the conservation and protection of whales, especially in waters sanctioned by the IWC as a whale sanctuary,\u201d Rothwell said. Watson, the veteran anti-whaling activist, told CNN he\u2019s prepared to mount a physical response \u2013 with a former Japanese fisheries patrol vessel he\u2019s acquired in anticipation of Japanese whalers returning to the Antarctic by the end of the year. \u201cIt\u2019s called the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary for a reason \u2013 you don\u2019t kill whales there,\u201d Watson said. \u201cWe want to be able to track them down and intercept them like we\u2019ve done before \u2013 and we are more than prepared to do it again.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/asia/japan-whaling-mothership-kangei-maru-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "world"}}

As well as announcing Marcano\u2019s punishment, the MLB also on Tuesday banned four other baseball players for a year apiece for violating betting rules. According to an MLB investigation, Marcano placed 387 baseball bets, including 231 MLB-related ones, over two periods in 2022 and 2023 while he was a member of the Pittsburgh Pirates and while he was on the injured list. He gambled more than $150,000 on baseball, with $87,319 of that on MLB-related bets. The MLB investigation found that 25 of those bets included Pirates games while Marcano was assigned to the Major League club. The MLB probe found that \u201calmost all of Marcano\u2019s Pirates bets were on which club (the Pirates or their opponent) would win the game or whether there would be more or less than a certain number of runs scored in the game.\u201d The MLB investigation said that \u201cthere is no evidence to suggest \u2014 and Marcano denies \u2014 that any outcomes in the baseball games on which he placed bets were compromised, influenced, or manipulated in any way.\u201d In a statement sent to CNN, the Padres said: \u201cWe cannot comment on violations that occurred outside of our organization. We fully support MLB\u2019s sports betting policy and the need to adhere to all provisions of Rule 21. We will continue to educate all members of our organization regarding their obligations under the policy.\u201d The Pirates said in a statement sent to CNN that it was \u201cextremely disappointed of Tucupita\u2019s actions and [the team is] fully supportive of Major League Baseball\u2019s ruling. \u201cThe Pirates, along with MLB, Players Association, and every Club, work to ensure all involved within our game are aware of the rules and policies around gambling. While the thorough investigation revealed no evidence of any games being compromised, influenced, or manipulated in any way in this case, protecting the integrity of our game is paramount.\u201d The four other players were banned for one year for betting on baseball games while in the minor leagues. Those players are Oakland Athletics pitcher Michael Kelly, Padres minor league pitcher Jay Groome, Philadelphia Phillies minor league infielder Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez and Arizona Diamondbacks minor league pitcher Andrew Saalfrank. The MLB said that none of the players are appealing their discipline. According to MLB rules, a player found guilty of betting on baseball games involving teams other than their own are subject to a one-year suspension. A player gambling on their own team\u2019s games will receive a lifetime ban. \u201cThe strict enforcement of Major League Baseball\u2019s rules and policies governing gambling conduct is a critical component of upholding our most important priority: protecting the integrity of our games for the fans,\u201d MLB commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement. \u201cThe longstanding prohibition against betting on Major League Baseball games by those in the sport has been a bedrock principle for over a century. We have been clear that the privilege of playing in baseball comes with a responsibility to refrain from engaging in certain types of behavior that are legal for other people. \u201cSince the Supreme Court decision opened the door to legalized sports betting, we have worked with licensed sports betting operators and other third parties to put ourselves in a better position from an integrity perspective through the transparency that a regulated sports betting system can provide,\u201d added Manfred. \u201cMLB will continue to invest heavily in integrity monitoring, educational programming and awareness initiatives with the goal of ensuring strict adherence to this fundamental rule of our game.\u201d Oakland pitcher Kelly was found to have placed 10 bets involving nine MLB games for a total of $99.22. He did not appear in any of the games on which he bet, and he did not make any bets involving his assigned team. The A\u2019s said in a statement they were \u201cdisappointed to learn\u201d about Kelly\u2019s betting infringements. \u201cWhile we cannot comment on the details, this violation occurred prior to Michael joining the A\u2019s organization and we fully support MLB\u2019s sports betting policy and the need to adhere to all provisions of Rule 21,\u201d the A\u2019s said in a statement. \u201cWe will continue to educate all members of our organization regarding their obligations under the policy.\u201d Phillies minor leaguer Rodr\u00edguez placed 31 baseball bets, comprised of three bets on college baseball games and 28 MLB-related bets totaling $749.09. The team said it was \u201cdisappointed to learn of the matter\u201d involving their player. CNN has reached out to the Diamondbacks for comment.

{"id": "2024_05_31_europe_us-weapons-ukraine-strike-russia-kharkiv-intl", "text": "The story of the past 27 months since Russia invaded Ukraine has been one of crumbling taboos. After repelling Russia\u2019s initial march on Kyiv, Ukraine has asked its Western allies for greater and greater support: first ammunition, then tanks, then cluster munitions, then fighter jets. Each time, the West has agonized over whether to grant Kyiv\u2019s latest request, fearing escalation and a potential Russian response. Each time, the taboo was broken \u2013 and nothing happened. What seemed beyond the pale one week had become banal the next. But the rhythm of deliberation and delay has been hard to shake. Despite securing more weapons from the United States last month, Ukraine has not been able to use them as it pleases. As Moscow this month launched its surprise assault on the northeastern Kharkiv region, Washington forbade Kyiv from using US weapons to strike targets inside Russia. This too crumbled. President Joe Biden this week gave Ukraine permission to carry out limited strikes using US weapons in Russian territory around Kharkiv, after several European nations had removed restrictions on how the weapons they have given to Kyiv can be used. \u201cOver the past few weeks, Ukraine came to us and asked for the authorization to use weapons that were provided to defend against this aggression\u201d near Kharkiv city, \u201cincluding against Russian forces that are massing on the Russian side of the border,\u201d US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Friday on a visit to Prague, the Czech capital. He confirmed Biden had approved Ukraine\u2019s request. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky praised the decision as a \u201cstep forward\u201d which will help his forces to defend the embattled Kharkiv region. While the decision may mark a new phase of the war, analysts have questioned whether the new freedoms will significantly bolster Ukraine\u2019s ability to repel Russia\u2019s invasion. Some are bullish. This month, the calls for the US to remove the restrictions became more desperate, as Russia continue to pummel Kharkiv city with missiles and make gains elsewhere in the region. In a CNN op-ed, Adam Kinzinger and Ben Hodges described the bizarre effect of the US taboo: \u201cWe have heard Ukrainian soldiers repeatedly tell stories of Russian columns attacking, being repelled, and retreating to safe Russian territory to regroup, have a hot meal, plan and attack again.\u201d \u201cUkraine cannot win if Russians can attack civilian targets with impunity and call \u2018time out\u2019 in their own territory,\u201d they wrote, urging Biden to call his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin\u2019s bluff. But military analysts have tempered expectations, partly because the US is standing firm in not allowing Ukraine to use the most formidable munition it has been given to fire into Russia: the long-range missiles known as ATACMS that can hit targets 300 kilometers (nearly 200 miles) away. Instead, Ukraine can only use shorter-range missiles known as GMLRS, which have a range of around 70 kilometers (around 40 miles). Kateryna Stepanenko, an analyst at the Institute for the Study of War in Washington, told CNN the policy change will \u201cblunt\u201d Russia\u2019s offensive in Kharkiv, but still \u201cpreserves the majority of Russia\u2019s sanctuary space.\u201d \u201cThe policy still protects Russia\u2019s operational and deep rear sufficiently that this change near Kharkiv Oblast is insufficient to bring about a turning point in the war. Ukraine particularly needs the capacity to strike deep rear areas to defeat the Russian ground and air threats, as many Russian airfields that support strikes against Ukrainian cities are located outside of the allowed GMLRS range,\u201d she said. Franz-Stefan Gady, an associate fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, told CNN the GMLRS cross-border strikes will allow Ukraine \u201cto hit some Russian staging areas, command and control centers, as well as supply depots. It will not stop but complicate Russian military operations against Kharkhiv.\u201d \u201cWe need to be realistic about what can be expected from this policy change, since the Russian armed forces have already adapted to the introduction of ground-based precision fires,\u201d he said. Mathieu Boulegue, a researcher at the Center for European Policy Analysis, said the policy change would allow Ukraine to \u201cbe more efficient when it comes to repelling attacks and pushing back preemptively.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not a game changer, per se. It\u2019s an add-on, a steroid, an extra booster for Ukraine to defend itself,\u201d he said. Red lines fade The US is joining the United Kingdom, France, Germany and several others in removing restrictions on how Ukraine uses the weapons it is given. Before Biden gave the green light, Putin had made veiled nuclear threats to countries considering allowing Ukraine to strike Russia with their weapons. He warned the move could lead to \u201cserious consequences,\u201d particularly for \u201csmall and densely populated countries.\u201d As well as making nuclear threats, Putin also signaled earlier this month that he was open to peace talks. \u201cAll of these false narratives deliberately aimed to discourage Western decisionmakers from allowing Ukraine to preempt Russia\u2019s attack on Kharkiv city,\u201d Stepanenko said. While the removal of this taboo appears to mark a new chapter in the war, Russia has previously experienced Ukrainian strikes with Western weapons on territory it considers its own. Ukraine has frequently targeted occupied Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, using \u201cStorm Shadow\u201d missiles provided by the UK. Ukraine also launched strikes on Kharkiv and Kherson in late 2022, as it sought to liberate the regions occupied by Russia in the early weeks of the full-scale invasion. In both cases, Russia had warned Ukraine and its Western allies not to cross its red line. In both cases, Ukraine and its Western allies ignored the warning. \u201cThe Kremlin already regards strikes against occupied Crimea and Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhia oblasts as \u2018strikes against Russia,\u2019 but the reality is that there are few things that Russia can do to further escalate its war in Ukraine without incurring major risks,\u201d Stepanenko said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/europe/us-weapons-ukraine-strike-russia-kharkiv-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_25_style_zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk", "text": "Above Beijing\u2019s imperial center rises Jingshan, or Prospect Hill. From a pagoda at its modest peak, a panoramic view of the city presents itself. To the south, the dull golden roofs of the Forbidden City crest and fall, pulling the eye southward to Tiananmen \u2014 the Gate of Heavenly Peace \u2014 and the vast square of the same name just beyond. To the east stand the smooth metallic skyscrapers of the city\u2019s business district. To the north, at the top of Beijing\u2019s central axis \u2014 its so-called dragon\u2019s vein \u2014 sit the Bell and Drum Towers, which once acted as the city\u2019s collective timepiece. And stretching all along the western periphery are the calm, tree-lined waters of the manmade lakes, dug by hand for the pleasure of past emperors. It\u2019s this aerial view of \u201cZhongnanhai,\u201d meaning \u201cmiddle and southern seas,\u201d and the surrounding buildings that today\u2019s Chinese leaders prefer you did not see. That\u2019s because the 1,500-acre site of repurposed imperial pavilions and temples, along with gray modern offices has formed the leadership compound for the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP)  since 1950. As the seat of power, Zhongnanhai is often thought of as China\u2019s equivalent to the White House, or the Kremlin. Synonymous with China\u2019s communist party elite, and among the country\u2019s most secretive places, it is ringed by a centuries-old red ochre wall, with countless CCTV cameras periscoping above it \u2014 and patrolled assiduously by security forces in both plain clothes and uniform. A peaceful getaway For Chinese leader Xi Jinping\u2019s imperial forebears, the site served a somewhat different function. While emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties ruled their vast kingdom from within the Forbidden City, they built temples, halls and living quarters in Zhongnanhai; less grandly ceremonial than those of the palace, they were often oriented to take advantage of the views afforded by the area\u2019s tranquil waters and carefully planned gardens. Many of these emperors came to favor passing their days surrounded by drooping willows in the cool and quiet of this cultivated pleasure garden. A story relayed by the scholar Geremie Barm\u00e9 in his book \u201cThe Forbidden City\u201d tells of the 18th-century Qianlong Emperor\u2019s daily routine at Zhongnanhai: Each morning, after a first breakfast of cold swallows nest soup, he would travel by heated palanquin to the gardens\u2019\u00a0Studio of Convivial Delight,\u00a0a pavilion he built to capitalize on the view of the South Lake, where he would breakfast again on a meal of\u00a018 dishes. As the historian and author of \u201cThe Shortest History of China,\u201d Linda Jaivin, told CNN via email: \u201cThere is something outrageous and yet poetic about the incredible coordination and effort required of a team of bearers, cooks and attendants, just so that an emperor could come, catch a view of the magnificent Ocean Terrace, scoff his food and (leave).\u201d The first ruler to view Zhongnanhai as primarily a place to govern from, not simply relax in, was the Empress Dowager Cixi, who effectively controlled China for almost five decades from 1861. She lived for many years in the gardens\u2019 Hall of Ceremonial Phoenixes, which became the center of political authority in China. She would die there in 1908. The serene surroundings of Zhongnanhai also became, under Cixi, a place of punishment and confinement. In 1898, following attempted reforms that displeased her, Cixi imprisoned her nephew, the Guangxu Emperor, on Yingtai Island, which juts out into the southern lake. Built as a miniature version of the mythical Penglai island, home to the immortals of Chinese legend, the tiny piece of land would become the emperor\u2019s home for most of his life, bar a brief period when the Boxer rebellion of 1900 forced the whole court to flee the capital. He would die on Yingtai Island from arsenic poisoning the day before the Empress Dowager herself. His imprisonment and death, said writer M. A. Aldrich, author of \u201cThe Search for a Vanishing Beijing: A Guide to China\u2019s Capital Through the Ages,\u201d perhaps adds a touch of poignancy for any subsequent resident of Zhongnanhai. \u201cIn addition to being a site that preserves sites of imperial splendor,\u201d he told CNN, \u201cit also functions as a reminder to the political elite about the consequences for stepping out of line.\u201d For Aldrich, however, the Zhongnanhai compound also represents the destructive impulses of the CCP towards its adopted capital in the years after 1949, when Mao Zedong proclaimed the foundation of the People\u2019s Republic. \u201cAs a political symbol of the New China, it has been torn up, rebuilt, expanded, and revamped so many times that its connection with its elegant past has been lost,\u201d Aldrich said. Architectural changes There have been serious revisions to the architecture of Zhongnanhai since the end of imperial rule in 1912. After the last emperor abdicated the throne, China\u2019s new president Yuan Shikai granted him the right to live on the northern section of the Forbidden City \u2014 and then took Zhongnanhai to be his new administration\u2019s headquarters. The changes he made to the imperial gardens were disparaged by many of the Westerners who visited them. \u201cWhatever may be one\u2019s opinion as to whether Yuan Shikai \u2018exalted his aim\u2019 in his political career, he certainly cannot be said to have done so as builder and architect,\u201d wrote L.C. Arlington and William Lewisohn in their 1935 book \u201cIn Search of Old Peking,\u201d \u201cfor all the buildings that have been erected or restored by him are in the worst possible taste.\u201d Most notable of these changes \u2014 at least to ordinary Beijingers \u2014 was the repurposing of a two-story pavilion at the very south of the gardens. Known as the Precious Moon Tower, it had been built decades earlier by the Qianlong Emperor for a homesick lover, a Muslim woman from Xinjiang, taken to Beijing as part of the spoils of war. The concubine would gaze south from the tower toward a mock mosque and bazaar the emperor had especially constructed to assuage her longing for home. Yuan refashioned this pavilion into the main entrance to his presidential compound, and established a tall watchtower just to its east. The gate was named Xinhuamen, or the Gate of New China. Today, the structure remains coated in the same deep red that graces the walls of all Beijing\u2019s imperial buildings, with a roof of glazed yellow tiles and detailing that runs below the roofline, picked out in blue and gold. The gate is now flanked by two red banners that speak to its modern purpose as China\u2019s political and party headquarters: \u201cLong Live the Great Communist Party of China\u201d reads one; and \u201cLong Live the Invincible Mao Zedong Thought\u201d on the other. On a screen wall recessed behind the entrance way, Chinese characters written in Mao\u2019s own calligraphic style declare: \u201cServe the People.\u201d Facing out onto Beijing\u2019s main east-west thoroughfare, the gate remains the most conspicuous part of Zhongnanhai. The rest of the compound has, since 1989, been firmly off-limits to the Chinese public. Seat of power Initially, after the communist victory in China\u2019s civil war in 1949, Mao Zedong took up residence at Shuangqing Villa in Fragrant Hills, another former imperial garden to the west of Beijing. Though wary of establishing himself in the imperial heart of Beijing \u2014 it is said that he refused ever to enter the Forbidden City, for fear of being associated with the power structures of old, feudal China he had fought to overthrow \u2014 Mao ultimately moved into Zhongnanhai and, in late 1949, he set up in the\u00a0Garden of Abundant Beneficence,\u00a0a large courtyard compound favored by both the Qianlong and Kangxi emperors, where he would hold court with dignitaries\u00a0and live\u00a0until 1966. Having re-established Zhongnanhai as a center of political power in the new China, Mao set about rebuilding the compound according to his tastes. \u201cSince 1949, an assortment of new architecture styles has encroached into Zhongnanhai, with a tennis court, gymnasium, swimming pools and Western buildings topped off with Chinese eave roofs adding a discordant note that would not have been appreciated by its traditionally-minded original owners,\u201d said Aldrich. In 1966, Mao moved from the Garden of Abundant Beneficence to a specially built house beside his beloved indoor swimming pool. He often summoned officials to speak to him as he bobbed in the water \u2014 and famously received Russian leader Nikita Khrushchev at his pool during a 1958 visit. \u201cTheir interpreters had to pace alongside the edge of the pool,\u201d said Jaivin. \u201cThe Russian couldn\u2019t swim and had to wear water wings. Mao loved both swimming and putting Khrushchev in his place. Finally, Khrushchev got sick of it, and clambered out to sit on the edge, dangling his feet in the water.\u201d In the residence next door, Mao lined his rooms with bookshelves housing an extensive library of Chinese classical literature. \u201cIt was here,\u201d noted Aldrich, \u201cwith the background trappings of a scholar, that he met Nixon and Kissinger in 1972.\u201d Most subsequent leaders have preferred to keep a house outside the Zhongnanhai compound. Deng Xiaoping lived, from 1977, in a courtyard house on a nearby lane adjacent to Beihai, the \u201cNorthern Sea\u201d of central Beijing\u2019s chain of lakes. While not officially disclosed, it is believed that more contemporary leaders, including Xi Jinping and his predecessors Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, have maintained homes in an exclusive gated compound in Jade Spring Hill, sometimes called the \u201cback garden\u201d of Chinese politics, out to the city\u2019s west. Aldrich noted that those leaders and party cadres who used Zhongnanhai as their primary residence often attracted unwelcome scrutiny for their activities, particularly during years of political turbulence. \u201cIn his memoirs, Chairman Mao\u2019s physician, Li Zhisui, commented that (the complex\u2019s) residents were always under surveillance,\u201d Aldrich said. \u201cDuring the Cultural Revolution, the simple act of making a fire would bring down the wrath of the security guards on the perpetrator. It was believed that such a fire was proof that incriminating or seditious materials were being destroyed.\u201d The imperial gardens offering vistas of Zhongnanhai\u2019s lakes have, today, been filled in with dozens of gray offices and meeting halls, many of which date to 1970s, when Zhongnanhai underwent significant razing and renovation \u2014 the rebuilding was so extensive that one visitor in 1979 described the grounds resembling a construction site, with muddy roads that were impossible to walk on. The contemporary compound splits roughly in two, with the northern buildings, on the banks of the \u201cmiddle lake,\u201d used as the headquarters of China\u2019s top executive body, the State Council. It is here that foreign dignitaries are admitted. Around the \u201csouthern lake,\u201d meanwhile, are the headquarters of the CCP, including, within Qinzheng Hall (the Hall of Diligent Government), the offices of the general secretary of the party (a post currently held by Xi). Many of the most historically significant political events to occur at Zhongnanhai have taken place in Huairen Hall, or the Hall of Cherished Compassion, on the western side of the Middle Lake. The hall was added to the imperial park during the late Qing dynasty, but was then extensively remodeled by the CCP in the early 1950s to impart a more august socialist grandeur. It is a broad, imposing ceremonial hall with staggered roofs of glazed green tiles falling in curved lines to upturned corners; the facade of austere grey brick is interrupted by red wooden pillars, windows and doors. The building\u2019s capacious interior houses a large auditorium, as well as numerous smaller meeting rooms. The hall has, for decades, served as the main meeting place for China\u2019s Politburo, the party\u2019s decision-making body usually comprising about two dozen members. On occasion, it has also hosted the Politburo\u2019s Standing Committee, the core of China\u2019s political elite, (the power of both bodies has notably dwindled in the era of Xi), though they most commonly meet in Qinzheng Hall, close to the general secretary\u2019s office. During the tumult of the Cultural Revolution vital discussions and debates occurred at Huairen Hall, and, in the months after its conclusion, it was there that three of the so-called Gang of Four \u2014 the political faction that included Mao\u2019s wife held responsible for the worst excesses of the era \u2014 were arrested, tricked into attending a meeting they thought was about the publication of the fifth volume of Mao\u2019s Selected Works. In April 1989, former party head Hu Yaobang suffered a heart-attack during a Politburo meeting at Huairen; his death a week later would trigger the Tiananmen Square protests that the government forcibly cracked down on in early June of that year. However, the compound hasn\u2019t always been so forbidden for the masses following the collapse of China\u2019s imperial dynasty. In the late 1920s, it became a park, with tourists allowed to boat on and swim in the lakes, while in the 1980s, the public could access some of its scenic and historical spots, including\u00a0Mao\u2019s\u00a0former residence, on\u00a0organized weekend tours.\u00a0Even early in 1989, a journalist for the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0was able to casually\u00a0drive\u00a0a senior official into the compound and drop him off inside.\u00a0During a period of warmer US and China relations in 2011, former Chinese president\u00a0Hu Jintao\u00a0invited\u00a0a group of American high school students to Zhongnanhai. Modern security concerns Today, Zhongnanhai is more closely-guarded than ever, though the inexorable development of the city has caused problems in maintaining the compound\u2019s secrecy. When an annex to the nearby Beijing Hotel was built in\u00a01973, authorities were panicked by the realization that from its upper floors one could quite easily see \u2013 and potentially target a sniper rifle \u2013 into Zhongnanhai. A building was hastily erected on the western edge of the Forbidden City to restrict this view. Likewise in 2018, when Beijing\u2019s new tallest building was\u00a0completed\u00a0\u2013 the 528-meter Citic tower, better known as the \u201cZun\u201d \u2013 the country\u2019s national security apparatus reportedly requisitioned the top floors amid fears that visitors or occupants might be able to spy into the compound. Beijing authorities did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on the security situation at the time. Zhongnanhai\u2019s entrance, Xinhuamen, has also been the site of repeated demonstrations in recent decades; in 1989, it was a gathering point for students taking part in the Tiananmen protests, whilst in 1999, more than 10,000 members of the since-banned Falun Gong gathered on the sidewalks near Zhongnanhai to protest their treatment at the hands of the government. So, while Zhongnanhai is sometimes compared to the White House, Aldrich argues that the paranoia with which the compound is today guarded makes it more like the imperial palace of centuries past: \u201cSince ordinary people are not allowed to enter Zhongnanhai, it is probably more appropriate to describe it as a \u2018New Forbidden City\u2019 for China\u2019s ruling elite rather than a place with a personal political resonance for the average citizen,\u201d he said. \u201cHeck, even the Kremlin is open to tourists!\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/style/zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "world"}}

Defending champion Djokovic was aiming to win his 25th grand slam singles title at Roland Garros, but pain in his right knee flared up during a bruising, five-set contest against Cer\u00fandolo. \u201cI played with my heart and gave my all in yesterday\u2019s match and unfortunately, due to a medial meniscus tear in my right knee, my team and I had to make a tough decision after careful consideration and consultation,\u201d Djokovic said on\u00a0Instagram confirming his withdrawal Tuesday. \u201cI wish the best of luck to the players competing this week and sincerely thank the incredible fans for all of the love and continued support.

The 37-year-old\u2019s hard-fought victory against Cer\u00fandolo came just two days after he played another five-set match against Lorenzo Musetti in the third round, which finished just after 3 a.m. local time. And while Djokovic showed phenomenal resolve and perseverance to come back and win against Cer\u00fandolo, he later admitted to having concerns about pain in his right knee, which he said only subsided once his medication had kicked in near the end of the match. \u201cAt one point, I didn\u2019t know, to be honest, whether I should continue or not with what\u2019s happening,\u201d Djokovic told reporters on Monday. He added that he had felt \u201cslight discomfort\u201d in the knee prior to the tournament but said it wasn\u2019t \u201can injury that would be concerning me at all.\u201d After dominating the first set, Djokovic tweaked his knee at the start of the second and took a medical timeout. The 37-year-old later acknowledged that his movement was hampered, particularly when he was forced to make a sudden change of direction or race to the net to retrieve a drop shot. It was only near the end of the fourth set when Djokovic was able to seemingly move without pain and raise his game. He said that persistent rain in Paris had made the courts more slippery than usual and that his request for the clay to be swept more regularly during the match was rejected. \u201cI slipped way too many times,\u201d Djokovic told reporters. \u201cThat is quite unusual \u2026 I\u2019ve slipped and fallen on the clay many times in my life, and on grass as well, but this was just too many times today. \u201cCould this injury have been prevented?\u201d he added. \u201cPossibly, if there was just a little bit more frequent care of the court during the set. That\u2019s basically all I asked for.\u201d CNN has contacted French Open organizers for further comment. Djokovic\u2019s withdrawal means that his scheduled quarterfinal opponent, Norwegian Casper Ruud, will progress to the semifinals, while Jannik Sinner, the reigning Australian Open champion, will rise to the top of the world rankings for the first time in his career.

It\u2019s a Russian S-300. On Russian territory. The first days after permission to use Western weapons on enemy territory,\u201d Ukrainian government minister Iryna Vereshchuk posted on Facebook alongside a picture purporting to show the strike. This comes just days after US President Joe Biden gave Ukraine permission to carry out limited strikes using US weapons in Russian territory around Kharkiv, after several European nations had removed restrictions on how the weapons can be used. It is unclear if the weapons used in the strike described by Vereshchuk were US-supplied. Ukraine had for months pleaded with Washington to allow it to strike targets on Russian soil with US weapons, as Moscow launched a brutal aerial and ground assault on Kharkiv, safe in the knowledge that its troops could retreat back to Russian soil to regroup and its weapons depots could not be targeted with Western arms. The permission granted by the US was both groundbreaking and bold, but tentative and highly conditional. Ukraine can only hit targets around Kharkiv, and the US is standing firm in not allowing Ukraine to use the most formidable munition it has been given to fire into Russia: the long-range missiles known as ATACMS that can hit targets 300 kilometers (nearly 200 miles) away. Instead, Ukraine can only use shorter-range missiles known as GMLRS, which have a range of around 70 kilometers (around 40 miles).

With results in from 22% of polling stations at 4 p.m. local time, support for the ANC stood at 43.5%. The official opposition party, the Democratic Alliance (DA), had 24.7% of the vote, while the far-left Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) \u2013 a splinter party of the ANC \u2013 had 8.9%, data from the country\u2019s electoral commission showed. The respected research group CSIR modeled the ANC winning less than 45% of the national poll as of mid-morning on Thursday. Officials of the Independent Electoral Commission have stressed that the official tally could take several days and some larger voting wards could take more time to be tallied. In past elections, results from rural areas \u2013 where the ANC has major strongholds \u2013 have come in later, boosting results for the party. Once all the votes are counted, if the ANC remains below 50% it will be forced to enter a coalition with one or more parties. Depending on how low its support dips, it may need to form a deal with one of the larger opposition parties such as the DA or EFF to remain in power. Another ANC splinter party, the uMkhonto weSizwe Party (MK), led by former President Jacob Zuma appears to be on course to do well in KwaZulu-Natal, the eastern coastal province where Durban is located. At 10am local time, it had 42.3% of the votes there compared to 20.1% for the ANC. Zuma \u2013 a fierce critic of current ANC leader and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa \u2013 was forced to\u00a0resign as leader in 2018\u00a0and served a brief stint in jail in 2021 for contempt of court.

This year, the commission has set Sunday, June 2, as the final results day.

{"id": "2024_05_30_europe_iceland-volcano-eruption-grindavik-intl-hnk", "text": "A volcano in southwestern Iceland erupted Wednesday for the fifth time since December, spewing massive lava flows that threatened to cut off the town of Grindav\u00edk and prompting the evacuation of the world-famous Blue Lagoon. The eruption began around 1 p.m. local time (9 a.m. ET) Wednesday following an earthquake at the Sundhn\u00faks crater, Iceland\u2019s public broadcaster RUV reported. Iceland\u2019s Meteorological Office had earlier warned that a volcanic eruption was likely following \u201cintense seismic activity\u201d at the crater and a build-up of magma in its underground reservoir. Dramatic video and images from the scene showed fountains of red-hot lava shooting into the air along a 3.4-kilometer (two-mile) fissure near Mount Hagafell on the Reykjanes Peninsula. Lava flows initially cut off two out of three roads leading to the fishing town of Grindav\u00edk and were steadily moving along a defensive barrier built to save the town and key infrastructure from being destroyed, Iceland\u2019s Meteorological Office said. But the situation had improved by Thursday, the mayor of Grindav\u00edk said. The town remains without electricity, but both hot and cold water are running in the town with no apparent damage to the piping system, RUV reported. \u201cI like the situation quite well compared to how it looked at the beginning of the eruption yesterday,\u201d Mayor Fannar J\u00f3nasson said. Initial monitoring by the Met Office warned the start of the eruption was \u201cmore vigorous\u201d than previous times, but the lava activity had \u201csignificantly decreased overnight,\u201d it said. Just hours before, V\u00ed\u00f0ir Reynisson, from Iceland\u2019s Civil Defense, had told RUV that \u201clava is flowing outside the defense walls at Grindav\u00edk in several places, and lava is also starting to flow outside the walls at Svartsengi.\u201d He warned that Grindav\u00edk was at risk of becoming completely cut off, though he added that the defense barriers were holding. \u201cThe houses in the west and farthest part of the town would have gone under the lava if it weren\u2019t for the defensive walls, but they are still standing and defending,\u201d Reynisson reportedly said. Grindav\u00edk, a town of about 3,000 people,\u00a0was mostly evacuated before a previous eruption in December. Residents and responders who remain in the town have been urged to leave while they still can, though police told RUV that three residents are refusing to evacuate. Electricity to Grindav\u00edk was cut on Wednesday as a protective measure as lava flows closed in on high-voltage lines and hot and cold pipes in the ground, Kristinn Har\u00f0arsonar, production manager at energy company HS Orka, told RUV. \u201cMost of the high-voltage lines are gone, the pylons are badly damaged and some are on fire,\u201d the Civil Defense\u2019s Reynisson later said. Benedikt \u00d3feigsson, from the Met Office, told RUV that the beginning of this eruption was more powerful than previously due to more accumulated magma in the chamber. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot more lava flow than we\u2019ve seen before,\u201d he reportedly said. \u201cThis is reflected in today\u2019s massive lava flows.\u201d Iceland\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a post on X that there was no disruption to international or domestic flights. But for the third time in just over two months, the country\u2019s famous geothermal spa and tourist hotspot the Blue Lagoon was evacuated, according to its operations manager. Just under an hour\u2019s drive from Iceland\u2019s capital and largest city Reykjavik, the Blue Lagoon is one of the country\u2019s most popular tourist attractions. The site is part of southwest Iceland\u2019s Reykjanes Peninsula \u2014 a thick finger of land pointing west into the North Atlantic Ocean from Reykjavik. Iceland is one of the most active volcanic areas on the planet. Rather than having a central volcano, the Reykjanes Peninsula is dominated by a rift valley, with lava fields and cones. The environment agency\u2019s air quality meters are \u201cgreen\u201d across\u00a0Iceland, indicating there is currently no air pollution from the eruption, the monitoring website\u00a0shows. However,\u00a0Iceland\u2019s national police warned a westerly wind could carry gas pollution from the eruption eastward on Thursday into Friday, which might affect areas in South\u00a0Iceland. \u201cAccording to the\u00a0Icelandic Met Office, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the amount of gas emissions from the eruption site,\u201d the police said in a\u00a0statement. While the gas pollution forecasted in Reykjav\u00edk on Wednesday never materialized, police encouraged residents to monitor real-time air pollution levels online.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/europe/iceland-volcano-eruption-grindavik-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_04_10_style_graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers", "text": "Climbing up abandoned, unfinished floors and tightrope walking across balcony ledges, backpacks clanging with cans of alkyd and acrylic, a collective of Los Angeles graffiti artists have transformed their craft beyond urban aesthetics to champion community issues. Their choice of canvas: Oceanwide Plaza in Downtown LA. Occupying over a full square city block, the plaza was imagined as a vast mixed-use building project, offering city residents over 500 lavish condominiums, a five-star hotel, retail spaces, restaurants and a private 2-acre park. However, construction on the $1 billion project, which began in 2015, was shelved after the Chinese-backed contractor Oceanwide Holdings ran out of funding\u00a0in 2019 \u2014 and it has lain unfinished ever since. The plaza\u2019s status \u2014 and potential \u2014 as an eye-catching venue for their work spread by word of mouth within the graffiti community in recent months. Security at the site was known to be lax, an important detail as accessing the plaza\u2019s towers and other buildings constitutes trespassing. (The Los Angeles City Attorney confirmed to CNN that, as of April 3, criminal charges have been filed against 23 individuals, for violations including trespassing and possession of vandalism tools.) \u201cIt was like a gift from the graffiti gods\u2026 A giant canvas in the middle of downtown,\u201d tagger ENDEM told CNN, speaking on behalf of himself and his graffiti crew, NCT. \u201cWe were like, \u2018Let\u2019s do it right. Let\u2019s do it as if the whole world is going to see this.\u2019\u201d Historically, graffiti has often been used as protest art. While the practice dates back thousands of years, it\u2019s most commonly viewed in a contemporary context (within graffiti\u2019s \u201cmodern\u201d era, which dates back to the 1960s and 70s) as a creative vehicle for challenging societal norms and inequities \u2014 whether on the Berlin Wall in Germany or subway cars in New York City; whether painted by anonymous artists or well-known figures like Keith Haring or Banksy, even if the latter is, technically, anonymous himself. Still, neither ENDEM nor any of the other artists involved realized how famous their work on the Oceanside towers would become. Sharing his artwork on Instagram on January 31, a video from ENDEM quickly racked up tens of thousands of views: Vibrant images of bright block lettering splayed across the building\u2019s exterior paired with footage from the inside \u2014 the artist posing with shots of his spray paint cans, poised above the cityscape. The viral footage, among other visuals shared on social media, quickly opened the floodgates. Hitting Oceanside became a mark of credibility in the graffiti world; by mid-February, the number of tags and other graffiti pieces there were multiplying overnight. \u201cIt was an open house people going in and out. It was beautiful. It was like graffiti paradise,\u201d ENDEM said. \u201cIt felt exactly like the streets, but concentrated.\u201d Transformed in part into an art installation, Oceanwide became an opportunity for the graffiti artists to leave a message to the city below, and a call-out to policy makers who leave buildings to rot. \u201cGraffiti shows you where the city hurts,\u201d Roger Gastman, owner and founder of the LA-based arts organization Beyond the Streets, told CNN. Renowned for its large-scale exhibitions, immersive educational programs, pop-up events and partnerships, Beyond the Streets works to educate and celebrate the diverse dimensions of graffiti as a medium. To him, the mission of graffiti is clear: to challenge, educate, and redefine public perception of the medium. Earl Ofari Hutchinson, president of The Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable, a nonpartisan public policy forum\u00a0for civic participation and education,\u00a0sees the abandoned towers as amplifying the social issues of the community they are situated in, connecting the graffiti-laden structures to the urban blight that surrounds them in LA\u2019s Skid Row. Skid Row is a 50-block sector of downtown LA where between 8,000 and 11,000 unhoused people live in challenging, often squalid conditions. \u201cYou\u2019ve got tens of thousands of people displaced because of over urban development. And as a result of that, they\u2019re on the streets,\u201d Hutchinson told CNN, noting that the homeless population in Los Angeles is continuing to grow. (The Los Angeles Housing Services Authority reports a 9% increase in homelessness in LA county in 2023 and a 10% increase in the city from 2022.) \u201cNow, set right in the middle of that, you have\u2026 a development that will never be completed.\u201d \u201cWhat you have here is a classic urban nightmare brought on by very poor policies \u2014 fiscal, financial, budgetary and political problems (in) a city that has just gone off the rails in terms of over-development and lack of affordability,\u201d Hutchinson added. Still, Hutchinson is no fan of the graffiti either. To him, and many other LA residents who have said they disapprove of the \u201cvandalism,\u201d the plaza is a sore sight for eyes. \u201cThe problem is you\u2019re talking about violating public space and with no permission\u2026 that doesn\u2019t fly with me,\u201d Hutchinson said. \u201cThe fact of the matter is, the public has not given you approval. (And) the general public has to pay for the removal.\u201d Costs currently borne by the taxpayer at the Oceanwide Plaza site include the security details provided by the LAPD as well as the graffiti cleanup Hutchinson highlights. (\u201cThis has strained our deployment,\u201d LAPD Chief Michel Moore said during a February meeting of the Los Angeles City Council. \u201cWe have called in some officers on an overtime basis so that we can provide for these added patrols or station them at that site to deter vandals and others from gaining access.\u201d) Clean teams working in the neighborhoods surrounding Oceanwide remove on average some 2,000 square feet of graffiti per week, with that figure growing in recent months. \u201cPeople forget that people live here. People own businesses here and they don\u2019t want to have to spend the time and money to clean it up,\u201d said Blair Besten, executive director of the Historic Core of Downtown Los Angeles, an organization which works to improve the quality of life in downtown neighborhoods. The Historic Core prioritizes street sweeping, trash collection \u2014 and graffiti removal. \u201cI would hardly call what they\u2019re doing art,\u201d Besten argued of the Oceanwide taggers. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty sloppy and quick. They come in fast and they knock it out and they leave.\u201d But to Gastman, graffiti is a powerful form of expression, and a call-to-action \u2014 particularly for those who emanate from struggles within home life, gang life or societal turmoil. Graffiti culture can offer an unexpected support system for those the city has abandoned, Gastman said. It becomes a platform for them to make their voices heard. \u201cIn graffiti culture, a lot of us know each other. We\u2019re all friends. We have the same mentality \u2014 we\u2019re just trying to get up. We\u2019re just trying to get noticed,\u201d explained ENDEM. In the midst of an addiction that led to his rock bottom, graffiti became his lifeline, he explained. \u201cI was at my lowest of lows, still trying to stay sober, I needed some type of outlet,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cGraffiti is something that you can hold on to. Its bigger than me, its everyone, it\u2019s a community.\u201d In this, ENDEM believes that the beauty of Oceanwide isn\u2019t tangible. Rather, it lies in the birth of a new generation of graffiti writers. \u201cThey can erase the graffiti on buildings, but they can never erase the impact that it has on the city of Los Angeles and the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to it. Yes, it\u2019s vandalism. Yes, it\u2019s art, and it\u2019s everything in between,\u201d Gastman concluded. \u201cThis is a real culture. It\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/10/style/graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "travel_maya-45-inch-screen-business-class-seat", "text": "Now that we carry around personal devices with high resolution, 4K screens in our back pockets, the seatback screens on airplanes can seem more than a little disappointing. Even if you\u2019ve opted for the priciest seats on the airplane, your inbuilt cabin screen is likely going to be poorer quality than the screen on your iPhone. That\u2019s where airplane seat manufacturer Collins Aerospace and inflight entertainment provider Panasonic Avionics step in. The two aviation powerhouses recently joined forces to reimagine the future of airplane TV and movie-viewing, via a swanky concept called MAYA. MAYA, which stands for \u201cMost Advanced Yet Achievable,\u201d is an ergonomic business class seat that comes equipped with an Astrova Curve 45-inch ultra-wide, ultra-high-definition OLED display. The screen syncs up with passengers\u2019 personal devices, offering an impressive headphone-less audio system. It all adds up to what Andrew Masson, vice president of product management and strategy at Panasonic Avionics, calls a \u201cmost immersive experience for the passenger.\u201d Collins and Panasonic\u2019s concept was one of the buzziest innovations on show last week at Aircraft Interiors Expo (AIX) in Hamburg, Germany \u2013 a major annual aviation show. According to Masson, the concept was well-received by industry insiders at AIX. \u201cIt was seen by many as [a] major step forward in premium travel, and aligned with their needs for innovating the passenger experience,\u201d he tells CNN Travel. Cinema experience Not only is MAYA\u2019s curved screen three times larger than classic business class seat options, Panasonic also envisages the seat offering an Ultra-Widescreen CinemaScope (21:9) display \u2013 a screen format more commonly found in cinemas. With that in mind, Masson calls the screen the \u201ccinematic centerpiece\u201d of MAYA\u2019s design, but stresses the screen\u2019s not only designed for movies. Passengers will also be able to use the screen to request meal orders, view maps and connect to their own personal device. Of course, some might be put off by the screen\u2019s dominance in the suite \u2013 not everyone spends their flight watching movies, and it\u2019s quite an intense feature. But for those who save up their favorite films to watch at 30,000 feet, MAYA will definitely have an appeal. When asked about the potential for the super high tech display to quickly become obsolete in today\u2019s fast-changing technology driven world, Masson suggests the screen\u2019s \u201cupgradable over time\u201d and built upon \u201ca sustainable technology path.\u201d \u201cWith such an integral role within the suite, we do not see any risk of obsolescence,\u201d he says. For now, MAYA remains a product concept \u2013 and specification, production processes and timeframes are still to be defined and developed. But Masson and his team are confident in the concept\u2019s future. \u201cWe showcased MAYA to many airlines at AIX, and their feedback was overwhelmingly positive,\u201d he says.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/maya-45-inch-screen-business-class-seat/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_04_weather_germany-floods-intl", "text": "Five people have died and thousands were evacuated in southern Germany after heavy rainfall hit the region and caused vast floods, prompting warnings from senior officials that the climate crisis was set to worsen extreme weather in the country. Two people and a firefighter have been confirmed dead in Bavaria state, Juergen Weiss of the Bavarian firefighters\u2019 association told CNN. One of those killed was washed away in her car, while the cause of death for the second civilian is not yet known. The firefighter died when his inflatable rubber boat capsized on Saturday. Meanwhile, two more people died in their basement in the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, police said. Authorities believe they perished while trying to pump water out of their basement. Six people and a 22-year-old firefighter remain missing, regional authorities say. After heavy rainfall, the German Armed Forces has sent 800 personnel to the region to help with rescue efforts. The German weather service has forecast no more heavy rainfall. The River Danube is the center of concern for rescue efforts, with high levels of water passing through the city of Regensburg on Tuesday morning, following an evacuation effort the evening before. On Tuesday morning, the level of the Danube had reached 31.5 feet (9.6 meters) in Passau, according to the Bavarian State Environmental Office, almost double the normal level for this time of year. Three rivers meet in the historic university town, where authorities have stopped motorized traffic and emptied underground car parks. In Bavaria, more than 52,000 emergency workers have been deployed, most of them volunteers, the firefighters\u2019 association said. But it added the vast area of flooding posed challenges for them. Climate change to blame German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said during a visit to the flood areas on Monday that increased flooding was an indication of climate change. \u201cWe are very clear about the fact that this is not just an event that has been happening for centuries, but that there are already more and more cases where we have to deal with disasters, floods in particular,\u201d\u00a0Scholz said. Economy Minister and Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck also noted Sunday that climate change is causing more severe weather events. \u201cWhat we are seeing is that the frequency of these events is increasing significantly. Record floods occur every few years \u2026 record rainfall every few years,\u201d Habeck, of the Greens Party, told broadcaster n-tv. Deadly floods hit Western Europe in 2021, with at least 220 people killed between July 12 and 15, mostly in Germany. Analysis into that event by climate scientists found that the record rainfall which triggered the deadly floods was made between 1.2 and nine times more likely by human-caused climate change. Other areas of Europe have also been affected by heavy rainfall in recent days. Firefighters near the city of Udine in Northeastern Italy said Sunday they recovered the bodies of two young women who were swept away by strong currents in the Natisone river, which was swollen by the precipitation. Firefighters say they are looking for the body of a third person. Slovenia was hit by flooding Monday evening. The Radenci and Gornja Radgona municipalities, near the Austrian border, were the worst affected in the country, according to public broadcaster RTV SLO. Likewise, flooding and landslides hit Croatia\u2019s Krapina-Zagorje county, in the north of the country on the border with Slovenia, following heavy rainfall on Monday, according to public news agency HINA.

{"id": "2024_06_04_style_gregory-crewdson-photos-suburbia-retrospective", "text": "By now, the famed photographer Gregory Crewdson\u2019s well-oiled, large-scale shoots are well documented. He has shut down areas of small towns and built soundstages of shadowy home interiors to get at what lays beneath the suburban facade, encapsulating a disquieting view of America. His weekslong productions include a full crew (and costs) comparable to small independent films,\u00a0as well as a casting process to find subjects who have a particular sense of melancholy. But for his earliest bodies of work, made in the late 1980s and early \u201990s, Crewdson hacked it the best he could. As a student at Yale\u2019s MFA photography program, he shot what he could find in homes in Connecticut and Western Massachusetts, directing families to act out scenes of creeping unease. He built uncanny table-top sets and tableaus of animals in nature akin to museum dioramas, using forced perspective to make them seem larger-than-life. For his formative images of small-town landscapes, he procured a tree surgeon\u2019s crane to get high above the rooftops, and \u2014 dangerously \u2014 pirated electricity from homes to light scenes rather than rent generators. \u201cIt was such a ragtag team,\u201d Crewdson recalled in a video call with CNN. \u201cIt was a bit like the Wild West \u2014 we had very few permissions or permits. We were just out there improvising, and it felt so exciting.\u201d Three decades later, Crewdson is reflecting across all his work as a major retrospective opens at the Albertina museum in Vienna, showing all his series together (minus his commercial work) for the first time. Among them, the self-titled show\u00a0brings together his grand, eight-year endeavor \u201cBeneath the Roses\u201d from the mid-2000s, his earlier low-budget black-and-white images of \u201cHover\u201d from 1996, and his meditative return to photography after a difficult period of divorce and transition, \u201cCathedral of the Pines\u201d in 2013. The show\u2019s curator, Walter Moser, framed the exhibition and catalog around Crewdson\u2019s long dialogue with cinema, including inspirations such as David Lynch, Steven Spielberg and Alfred Hitchcock. \u201cHe really is quoting popular culture,\u201d Moser said in a phone call with CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s a visual language we all know\u2026 so we can connect to that. At the same time, his topics are very in the present.\u201d When Crewdson began his career, he was among a set of postmodernist photographers \u2014\u00a0including Jeff Wall, Cindy Sherman and Philip-Lorca diCorcia \u2014 who were concerned with the artificiality of photography, often blurring truth and fiction. \u201cThey analyze how we perceive reality, and how reality is constructed in photography,\u201d Moser said. With Crewdson\u2019s work, he added: \u201cIt\u2019s completely staged, and every detail is thought through. But at the same time, it\u2019s also documentary in the sense that he\u2019s really reflecting the state of society.\u201d From the beginning, the now-familiar elements in his work were already present. Consider an image taken in the late \u201980s made in Pittsfield, Massachusetts \u2014 a city he has continually returned to, including amid its industrial decline for 2018\u2019s \u201cAn Eclipse of Moths.\u201d In the cool glow of nighttime, he photographed the view of a lit baseball field outside of a bedroom window, gauzy curtains pushed back. The composition of mysterious lighting, nighttime stillness and window \u2014 motifs that he\u2019s often returned to in the years since \u2014 clicked something into place, he said, a sense of something \u201cthere but not there\u201d that he\u2019s strived for ever sense. (The phrase is also the title of a 2017 documentary short directed by his studio manager and romantic partner, Juliane Hiam.) \u201cI remember taking it and knowing that it felt meaningful to me. There was something beautiful to me about looking through a window at something that\u2019s slightly outside of reach,\u201d Crewdson explained. \u201cWhen I look at the work I made when I was 25 or 26, it\u2019s like \u2014 in a very early stage \u2014 it\u2019s not that far from what I even did last week,\u201d he added. A \u2018hyperreal\u2019 environment Desire and disconnection have served as the architectural foundations on which neighborhoods are built in Crewdson\u2019s world, which he described as sitting \u201cpartially outside of reality.\u201d His final images are composites of multiple frames, allowing\u00a0for every area of the image\u00a0to be sharp, making them appear \u201chyperreal,\u201d as Moser described. Lost in thought or memory, the characters Crewdson places together rarely interact in these exaggerated environments. Instead, they are often confronted with strangeness cutting through the banality of the day in the form of a blinding spotlight, blazing fire or blood in the sink\u00a0\u2014 a callback to Spielberg\u2019s aliens lurking off-screen in \u201cClose Encounters of the Third Kind,\u201d or the found severed ear in Lynch\u2019s \u201cBlue Velvet.\u201d Artists such as Sherman, Edward Hopper and William Eggleston, who played a role in Crewdson\u2019s take on the American psyche, are also all apparent. But by now, the photographer\u2019s highly recognizable and inimitable style has helped shape the country\u2019s image, too. Some of his forays into pop culture were by his own hand, like when he teamed up with HBO\u2019s \u201cSix Feet Under\u201d \u2014 another uncanny, iconic study of the American family \u2014 to shoot a verdant kitchen scene with the cast for the promotion of the show\u2019s third season. Another, his lone editorial commission, \u201cDream House,\u201d for the New York Times Magazine in 2002, cast A-List actors Julianne Moore, Tilda Swinton, Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Gwyneth Paltrow as nameless residents of a\u00a0Vermont home, nearly obscuring their celebrity. But\u00a0his vision permeates elsewhere, too, through direct or presumed nods from other creatives: the eeriness of life in the small town of \u201cStranger Things,\u201d or the surreal floral-laden bedroom scenes of Taylor Swift\u2019s music video \u201cLavender Haze\u201d (with the latter parallels spotted by Swifties on TikTok). \u201cThat\u2019s the way culture works; it\u2019s like a two-way street,\u201d Crewdson said of unexpected references to his work. \u201cAnd sometimes it can be a little beguiling, but\u2026 you just have let that be part of the equation.\u201d Though Crewdson\u2019s body of work spans societal shifts that have included political polarization, an epidemic of loneliness, suburban anxiety and rural decline, he refrains from making specific commentary \u2014 though he contends \u201cit\u2019s in the work.\u201d He also avoids markers of place or time, switching out street signs or storefront text, and favoring non-distinct cars and clothing. Nor is his view of America a particularly wide one, shot primarily in Massachusetts, as well as New York and Connecticut, in the areas where he\u2019s lived, studied and taught his whole life. (Crewdson is\u00a0now the director of the graduate program he attended at Yale in New Haven, and resides in the Berkshires). Over time, he\u2019s revisited streets or buildings he\u2019s previously photographed and recast some of the same characters, creating subtle narrative connections across his series. \u201cThere are photographers who chronicle the American landscape in a vast way \u2014 for me, it\u2019s always been going back over and over again to the same towns,\u201d he said. \u201cPart of that\u2019s practical, because once you become a known figure in the town you can shut down streets and work with the fire department for wet downs,\u201d he explained, referring to the method to drench a set for atmospheric or weather effects. \u201cBut the bigger part is psychological. I have a connection to this place in terms of an aesthetic response \u2014 it feels familiar to me.\u201d Chasing stillness Even when Crewdson began his career, he knew his love for cinema would guide his work, though he has always stuck with teasing out the enigmatic narratives of still pictures rather than moving into film. But he didn\u2019t foresee that his productions would eventually become so immense. \u201cIt built slowly and organically, until all of the sudden you realize, \u2018This is kind of crazy, all these people,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cBut you have to block all that out and think about the picture in the end.\u201d He hasn\u2019t been behind the camera himself since \u2018Hover\u2019 in the 1990s; Instead, his longtime director of photography, Rick Sands, has that honor, while Crewdson prefers to have the scene come together in front of his eyes. \u201cThis might sound disingenuous, but it\u2019s the only way I really know how to make a picture now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s how I\u2019ve figured out how to reflect what I see in my head.\u201d In the 2017 documentary short \u201cThere But Not There,\u201d he describes the tranquility that occurs as the chaos of production comes together into that \u201celusive\u201d moment \u201cwhen the picture actually works,\u201d he said. It\u2019s that moment \u2014 not the final picture \u2014 that he\u2019s always chasing, he reiterated on the call. It doesn\u2019t always come easily, though; in a recent shoot, it happened, \u201cbut barely,\u201d he added with a laugh. Crewdson acknowledges that many of the themes he\u2019s returned to repeatedly, including the sense of being both \u201cpresent yet absent,\u201d are reflections of himself. His desire for a moment of stillness has wider implications in his own life. \u201cWe live our lives in like partial chaos. There are so many things that are destabilizing in life, and I have a lot of anxiety day to day \u2014 that\u2019s just a condition of being alive,\u201d he said. \u201cI think part of why we are drawn to art in general is to feel a certain sense of order or meaning. Even though my pictures can feel dystopic or sad, there\u2019s that moment where everything just comes together, and it feels like it makes sense.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/style/gregory-crewdson-photos-suburbia-retrospective/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_31_africa_south-africa-election-results-intl", "text": "South Africa\u2019s ruling African National Congress party has lost its majority for the first time in 30 years after national elections this week, marking the biggest political shift in the country since the end of apartheid. Nelson Mandela\u2019s party suffered a seismic blow at the polls, final election results announced on Sunday confirmed. Support for the ANC dropped to 40.18%, a huge slump from the 57.5% it received in the last election in 2019. The official opposition party, the centrist Democratic Alliance (DA), received 21.8% of the vote. Former President Jacob Zuma\u2019s newly formed uMkhonto weSizwe Party (MK) had nearly 14.59% of the vote. Another ANC splinter party \u2013 the far-left Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) \u2013 had nearly 10%, with results at 9.52% The blow to the ANC comes after\u00a0years of corruption scandals and economic mismanagement.\u00a0\u00a0As a result,\u00a0the ANC will be forced to form a coalition to govern\u00a0the world\u2019s most unequal country. Cyril Ramaphosa, the president of South Africa and the ANC \u2013 and once Mandela\u2019s favorite to succeed him as leader \u2013 promised a \u201cnew dawn\u201d when he took over in 2018 from disgraced former president Jacob Zuma. But many feel those promises never\u00a0materialized\u00a0and the\u00a0election\u00a0results reflect\u00a0a population deeply frustrated with the country\u2019s direction. South Africans could now face weeks of political uncertainty, as the ANC seeks to strike a coalition deal with former rivals. \u201cOur people have spoken, whether we like it or not they have spoken,\u201d Ramaphosa told an audience after the official results were announced. He added that the voices of the people had been \u201cheard\u201d and \u201cwe must respect their choices and their wishes.\u201d The\u00a0rebuke to the ANC\u00a0was hardly unexpected,\u00a0mirroring widespread dissatisfaction with the ruling party.\u00a0But the scale of the losses surprised some. \u201cWhat we have seen is voters are unhappy with the ANC\u2019s recent history. In particular\u00a0what happened in the Zuma years and what followed on from that,\u201d analyst and former ANC MP Melanie Verwoerd told CNN. There has been \u201ca general arrogance and loss of connection with the general voter from the ANC side,\u201d Verwoerd said, adding that parties like MK and the EFF have capitalized on\u00a0that discontent. Zuma \u2013 a fierce critic of Ramaphosa \u2013 was forced to\u00a0resign as leader in 2018\u00a0and served a brief stint in jail in 2021 for contempt of court.\u00a0The Constitutional Court barred the\u00a082-year-old\u00a0from running for parliament\u00a0in May, but\u00a0his face remained on the MK party ballot. The results from Wednesday\u2019s poll were officially announced despite protests from Zuma and his MK party. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer a recount. We want a total revote,\u201d the party\u2019s spokesperson Nhlamulo Ndhlela said Saturday evening. Zuma told a press briefing the party wanted a chance to present its case before the results were announced. South Africa\u2019s electoral commission had already extended the deadline for submissions of objections and appeals to 6 p.m. local time on Saturday. It received more than 500 objections. ANC in uncharted territory Substantial bargaining for the coalition government will now begin.\u00a0Political parties will have two weeks to form a coalition before a new parliament must convene to elect the nation\u2019s president.\u00a0If they fail, new elections will need to be held. ANC Secretary-General Fikile Mbalula admitted Sunday there was \u201cnothing to celebrate\u201d following the party\u2019s blow at the polls. \u201cWe wish to assure the people of South Africa that we have heard them. We have heard their concerns, their frustrations and their dissatisfaction,\u201d Mbalula told a media briefing. However, he warned potential coalition partners if they demand party leader Ramaphosa must step down \u201cthis is not going to happen.\u201d DA leader John Steenhuisen told CNN during an interview at the election\u2019s National Results Center that he had \u201cno sympathy for Mr. Ramaphosa and his party.\u201d \u201cIt is their spinelessness to deal with the prospect of Mr. Zuma and his sins of omission and commission that has led to him being a political force now that has come and wiped them out in places like KwaZulu-Natal and other parts of the country.\u201d The populous coastal eastern province of KwaZulu-Natal, where the major city of Durban is located and which is Zuma\u2019s home province, has traditionally been a stronghold of the conservative Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP). This time around, the MK party earned almost 46% of the provincial vote, but failed to get a majority and will be forced to find a coalition partner if it wants to govern the province. Zuma has faced\u00a0hundreds of corruption, fraud and racketeering charges\u00a0over the years. He has always denied all of them and became known as the \u201cTeflon President\u201d because few politicians could have survived the scandals he has faced and weathered. Analysts CNN spoke to, including Verwoerd,\u00a0believe the most likely coalition is between the ANC and DA. But others are more sceptical of that outcome.\u00a0They all agree that the country is in uncharted territory. Steenhuisen told CNN he wants to be part of a governing coalition and he believes a coalition \u201ccan work.\u201d Before\u00a0the election, the DA had already formed a\u00a0bloc with smaller opposition parties called the Multi-Party Charter. What he labels a \u201cdoomsday coalition\u201d is one of the other options on the table: a deal between the ANC-EFF\u00a0or\u00a0even\u00a0the\u00a0MK. But with such disdain inside those breakaway parties for\u00a0Ramaphosa, it would be quite some negotiation. The EFF is led by\u00a0former ANC youth leader Julius Malema. It espouses the expropriation of land without compensation and sweeping state nationalism.\u00a0The MK party\u2019s manifesto\u00a0holds\u00a0broadly\u00a0similar ideas and demands\u00a0an overhaul of the country\u2019s constitution\u00a0to restore more powers to traditional leaders. Not since the dawn of democracy in 1994 has South Africa\u2019s political landscape been so unclear. But\u00a0some analysts believe \u2013 despite the uncertainty \u2013\u00a0that\u00a0the results of this election could be a win for democracy. \u201cIt\u00a0is probably a maturity in the democracy, we needed change and it is never good to have such a one-party dominance in a country,\u201d Verwoerd said. \u201cIt might be a little bit more unstable as we go into the future. But for\u00a0democracy\u2019s\u00a0sake, it is most probably a good thing.\u201d Ramaphosa appeared to make a similar point in his post results speech, saying the announcement \u201cin many ways represents a victory for our democracy as South Africans. It also represents a victory of our constitutional order\u201d and a \u201cvictory for all the people of South Africa.\u201d Verwoerd said that the ANC\u2019s prospects dropped dramatically under the previous president. \u201cOnce the Jacob Zuma years happened, it became pretty inevitable that there was going to be a slide,\u201d she added. A country going backwards The ANC swept to power in 1994 on a\u00a0pledge\u00a0to \u201cbuild a better life for all,\u201d winning almost 63% of the vote in the country\u2019s first democratic election. Fast forward three decades and rampant corruption, soaring joblessness, crippling\u00a0power cuts,\u00a0and feeble economic growth are severely impacting South Africans. The economy has gone backward over the past decade, evidenced by a sharp fall in living standards. According to the\u00a0World Bank, gross domestic product per capita has fallen from a peak in 2011, leaving the average South African 23% poorer. South Africa has the highest rate of unemployment in the world, according to\u00a0the\u00a0World Bank. \u00a0Inequality is also the world\u2019s worst. Black South Africans, who make up 81% of the population, are at the sharp end of this dire situation. Unemployment and poverty remain concentrated in the Black majority, in large part due to the\u00a0failure of public schooling, while most White South Africans have jobs and command considerably higher wages. Any coalition government will\u00a0be a bitter pill to swallow for the ANC and Ramaphosa,\u00a0who could soon be fighting for his political life. Leading analysts believe that the ANC was depending on its legacy too much. \u201cThe ANC was campaigning on three decades of its existence. But nobody was looking at the current president,\u201d said TK Pooe, a senior lecturer at Wits School of Governance in Johannesburg. He believes Ramaphosa is \u201cunder pressure\u201d. \u201cHistorically, it is an embarrassment for him. He always styles himself as the next Nelson Mandela,\u201d Pooe told CNN. But \u201clast recollection, Nelson Mandela never lost an election.\u201d Pooe said, with this election, voters have told the ANC three things: \u201cjobs, jobs, jobs.\u201d Whether a coalition government can deliver for the people is deeply uncertain, but one thing is clear:\u00a0South Africa and the ANC \u2013 Mandela\u2019s former liberation movement that triumphed over apartheid \u2013 will never be the same.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/africa/south-africa-election-results-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_04_17_style_copenhagen-stock-exchange-fire-police-investigation-intl", "text": "Police launched an investigation Wednesday into the fire that tore through Copenhagen\u2019s famous stock exchange building, causing the collapse of its spire and damaging centuries-old artwork and architecture. The blaze was still burning on Wednesday afternoon, more than 24 hours after it began, and authorities and citizens in the Danish capital have started reckoning with the loss of one of the city\u2019s most recognizable landmarks. Local firefighters continued to try to put out the fire, which ripped through\u00a0the building \u2013 known locally as B\u00f8rsen \u2013\u00a0from early Tuesday, reaching all its floors and causing the collapse of a dragon-tail spire that had long been a symbol of the city. The walls of the building are still standing, but the interior has been significantly damaged and the roof is partially collapsed. Firefighters used cranes to hose water down into the building. Copenhagen\u00a0police meanwhile launched an investigation on Wednesday, which they said will be a \u201ccomplicated process.\u201d Police officer Brian Belling said authorities have already \u201cconducted interviews, secured surveillance and carried out a large number of investigative steps.\u201d \u201cBut of course, there is still a lot to do, especially as we have not yet had the opportunity to examine\u00a0B\u00f8rsen itself,\u201d Belling added. The 17th century building exemplified the style of the Dutch Renaissance, and housed a number of artworks, some of which were saved on Tuesday. Residents were stunned by the outbreak, which brought back memories of the fire that tore through the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris exactly five years and a day earlier. \u201cMy first thought was (that) I hope that they rebuild it \u2013 it\u2019s never going to be the same but it\u2019s iconic to\u00a0Copenhagen\u00a0and Denmark,\u201d teacher Eva Simoni Lomholdt, 58, told Reuters. Brian Mikkelsen, the CEO of the Danish Chamber of Commerce which owns the building, told the news agency that a firefighter gave him the top of the spire on Wednesday morning after it was recovered following its fall. \u201cIt gives me hope because we have decided to rebuild the stock exchange because it\u2019s part of European history as a trading continent,\u201d he said. The old stock exchange \u2013 located only a few minutes walk from Christiansborg\u00a0Palace \u2013 dates back to 1625. It was built in the Dutch Renaissance style at the request of King Christian IV and had recently been undergoing renovations with its facade covered in scaffolding and protective coverings. It has been at the heart of Danish business since then; while it no longer houses the Danish stock exchange, it serves as the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce. Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said Tuesday a \u201cpiece of Danish history\u201d was on fire, calling the building \u201cirreplaceable.\u201d Denmark\u2019s culture minister Jakob Engel-Schmidt added that 400 years of cultural heritage had been damaged. \u201cHow touching it is to see how the employees at B\u00f8rsen, good people from the emergency services and passers-by work together to rescue art treasures and iconic images from the burning building,\u201d he said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/17/style/copenhagen-stock-exchange-fire-police-investigation-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_31_tech_fcc-affordable-connectivity-program-acp-close", "text": "The Affordable Connectivity Program, which helped low-income Americans get online, is no more. On Friday, the US government announced the final closure of the broadly popular federal program, which has helped tens of millions of households afford internet service, after Republicans in Congress ignored calls by consumer advocates and Democratic lawmakers to approve more funding this spring. The program\u2019s lapse threatens to throw nearly 60 million Americans into financial distress,\u00a0CNN has reported. The program officially ends on June 1, said the Federal Communications Commission, which administered the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) to approximately 1 in 5 households\u00a0across the country and\u00a0on tribal reservations. The 2.5-year-old ACP provided eligible low-income Americans with a monthly credit off their internet bills, worth up to $30 per month and as much as $75 per month for households on tribal lands. The pandemic-era program was a hit with members of both political parties and served tens of millions of seniors, veterans and rural and urban Americans alike. Program participants received\u00a0only partial benefits\u00a0in May ahead of the ACP\u2019s expected collapse. \u201cThe Affordable Connectivity Program filled an important gap that provider low-income programs, state and local affordability programs, and the Lifeline program cannot fully address,\u201d said FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel in a statement, referring to the name of another, similar FCC program that subsidizes wireless and home internet service. \u201cThe Commission is available to provide any assistance Congress may need to support funding the ACP in the future and stands ready to resume the program if additional funding is provided.\u201d Some US lawmakers proposed bipartisan legislation to extend the ACP in the months leading up to the deadline. But the bills languished in the face of inaction by Republican leaders who showed little interest in engaging with the issue. President Joe Biden and Democratic lawmakers have\u00a0publicly blamed\u00a0GOP leadership for allowing the ACP to end. A spokesperson for House Speaker Mike Johnson didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. On Friday, Biden reiterated his calls for Congress to pass legislation extending the ACP. He also announced a series of voluntary commitments by a handful of internet providers to offer \u2014 or continue offering \u2014 their own proprietary low-income internet plans.The list includes AT&T, Comcast, Cox, Charter\u2019s Spectrum and Verizon, among others. Those providers will continue to offer qualifying ACP households a broadband plan for $30 or less, the White House said, and together the companies are expected to cover roughly 10 million of the 23 million households relying on the ACP. The ACP was initially funded by Congress with a one-time budget of $14 billion. Biden has asked for $6 billion to continue the program and one bipartisan bill proposed renewing the ACP with $7 billion in additional funding. Kathryn de Wit, director of the Pew Charitable Trust\u2019s broadband access initiative, said reaching the deadline without a solution from Congress was a \u201cdisheartening\u201d outcome. \u201cWithout intervention, households participating in the program will immediately see their internet bills go up,\u201d de Wit said. \u201cWe know cost is a key barrier to connecting low-income families to the internet, so without ACP we can expect most participating households to either downgrade or drop their plans altogether.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/tech/fcc-affordable-connectivity-program-acp-close/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "weather_us-leads-tornado-numbers-tornado-alley-xpn", "text": "The US averages over 1,150 tornadoes every year. That\u2019s more than any other country. In fact, it\u2019s more than Canada, Australia and all European countries combined.  Within the US, every state has had at least one tornado, and some have dozens each year.  The US is special in terms of producing so many tornadoes, especially violent ones. In the US, the average number of tornado fatalities per year is 73. But in Europe, where the tornadoes are usually much weaker, the fatalities are estimated to be between 10 and 15 annually. Some states are deadlier than others Texas on average has 140 tornadoes every year \u2013 the most of any state. Kansas, Florida, Oklahoma, and Nebraska round out the top five. But the total number of tornadoes does not always tell the whole story. For example, despite Alabama having on average 42 tornadoes per year \u2013 more than three times fewer than Texas \u2013 it is at the top of the list for tornado fatalities. Alabama averages 14 tornado fatalities per year, almost double the next highest \u2013 Missouri with eight deaths per year. The time of day and the topography where the tornado occurs makes a big difference in the fatality rate. The topography in Alabama and other Southern states often includes rolling hills, plateaus, and many more trees than the Plains states like Kansas, Texas, and Nebraska, where a tornado often can be seen from miles away. The more likely a tornado can be seen often leads to the tornado being reported faster, allowing more time for people to be warned and seek shelter. Southern states such as Tennessee, Kentucky and  Arkansas also see more tornadoes overnight versus any other state. This can lead to higher fatalities, since many people are sleeping and unaware that a tornado is approaching.  \u201cTornadoes in the Southeast tend to be more dangerous than their Great Plains counterparts,\u201d says Brandon Miller, CNN Meteorologist.  \u201cThere are a number of reasons for this, some weather and some geographic. Southeastern tornadoes often travel faster, moved by a faster jet stream.\u201d  All of these factors can lead to higher fatality rate in Southern states compared to the Plains. But all of these states have a few things in common: the ideal atmospheric conditions for tornadoes to form. \u201cThe basic ingredients for severe thunderstorms that can make tornadoes are warm, moist air near the ground, relatively dry, cool air aloft (about 10,000 to 30,000 feet), and horizontal winds in the environment the storm forms in that increase as you go from the ground up and change direction with height, blowing from the equator near the ground and from the west aloft,\u201d says Dr. Harold Brooks, senior scientist with the NOAA National Severe Storms Laboratory. Low pressure systems in the US pull warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico and cool, dry air aloft from the Rocky Mountains or the High Desert in the southwest. The states that fall in between those two regions end up being in the ideal location for severe weather to ignite.  \u201cNo place else in the world has the large warm water on its equatorward side with a wide high range of mountains extending from north to south to the west of it,\u201d Dr. Brooks said. \u201cAll the other tornado prone regions have at least one feature suboptimal.\u201d  The US leads every other country for tornadoes Other countries experience tornadoes, including Germany, Australia, South Africa, eastern China, Japan, Bangladesh, Argentina, and more. Europe as a whole is comparable to the size of the US, but there is a vast difference in number of tornadoes and tornado fatalities.  From 2011 to 2020, the US averaged a preliminary total of 1,173 tornadoes per year, and Europe around 256. However, Dr. Pieter Groenemeijer, Director of the European Severe Storms Laboratory (ESSL), cautions that the European number may be on the low side. \u201cWeaker tornadoes are likely still under-reported in some countries, such as France and the UK,\u201d Groenemeijer says. European Russia (which is the part of the country west of 58 degrees East longitude), tops the list at 86 tornadoes annually. Germany comes in second with an average 28 tornadoes annually. The peak density of tornado reports coincides with the high population density over Belgium, the Netherlands, and northern Germany, according to a study on severe storms in Europe published in December 2020. The study also reports that thunderstorms are twice as frequent over the United States, with as many as four times more storm reports, compared to Europe. One thing most countries have in common is the time of day that tornadoes occur, which is most frequently during the afternoon and early evening. But the peak season is not the same. In the US, spring is the peak for tornado activity. For central and northern Europe the main tornado season is in summer, whereas it is autumn for the western and central Mediterranean region, and winter in the eastern Mediterranean. Outside of the US, Canada actually ranks second on the list for most tornadoes, with an average of 100 per year. Tornadoes are not limited to the Northern Hemisphere. Australia has dozens every year, and South Africa also reports annual occurrences. South America, much like other continents, has its own tornado hotspot, known as \u201cpasillo de los tornados.\u201d This tornado corridor includes Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, and a portion of Brazil.  According to the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research in New Zealand, tornadoes are relatively rare there. On average, around seven to 10 moderate to strong tornado events are reported in New Zealand every year.

{"id": "2024_06_03_americas_mexico-claudia-sheinbaum-profile-intl-hnk", "text": "Known as \u201cla Doctora\u201d for her glittering academic credentials, Claudia Sheinbaum is a physicist with a doctorate in energy engineering, the former mayor of one of the world\u2019s most populous cities, and was part of the United Nations panel of climate scientists that received a Nobel Peace Prize. And on Sunday, she became the first woman, and the first Jewish person, to be elected president of Mexico. Sheinbaum won around 60% of the vote in the largest election in Mexico\u2019s history, marking a historic achievement in a mostly Catholic country known for its deeply patriarchal culture. The 61-year-old is set to replace the outgoing President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, her longtime ally whose social welfare programs lifted many Mexicans out of poverty, making their leftist Morena party favorite in the polls. \u201cOur duty is and will always be to look after every single Mexican without distinction,\u201d Sheinbaum said in a speech early Monday morning. \u201cEven though many Mexicans do not fully agree with our project, we will have to walk in peace and harmony to continue building a fair and more prosperous Mexico.\u201d After her maternal grandparents emigrated from Europe to escape the Holocaust, Sheinbaum was born in Mexico City in 1962 \u2013 a city she would go on to serve in various roles across decades. While studying for her undergraduate degree at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), she became immersed in student politics, protesting against the privatization of public education. After graduating, she studied energy engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, where she became fluent in English and earned a Master\u2019s degree, before returning to UNAM for doctoral studies. Sheinbaum entered politics in 2000, when she was appointed environment secretary of Mexico City by Obrador, then the head of the city\u2019s government. After leaving the role in 2006, Sheinbaum committed herself to the study of energy, joining the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and becoming part of the team that received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007. In 2015, she became the first woman elected head of the Tlalpan district of Mexico City, serving until 2017. The next year, she was elected head of the government of the whole city \u2013 again, the first woman to do so \u2013 only stepping down in June 2023 to embark on her run for president. Sheinbaum has two children and one grandchild. Her partner, Jes\u00fas Mar\u00eda Tarriba, whom she met at university while both were studying physics, is a financial risk specialist at the Bank of Mexico. What challenges lie ahead? Had the constitution allowed it, Mexico would likely have re-elected Obrador, one of those rare politicians who \u2013 like FDR and JFK \u2013 is known simply by his initials, AMLO. After riding the wave of AMLO\u2019s popularity, some have questioned whether Sheinbaum will be able to distance herself sufficiently from her longtime ally. One of Sheinbaum\u2019s biographers, journalist Jorge Zepeda, has argued that, once in office, Sheinbaum will likely unfurl her own platform gradually: she will first act as \u201cthe faithful disciple of the leader,\u201d before offering \u201cglimpses\u201d of her own program, taking care not to stoke instability in the movement\u2019s base. But Zepeda has also noted clear differences between the two leaders. In an article for the Spanish daily El Pais, Zepeda recalled asking Sheinbaum what sets her apart from other politicians. \u201cI\u2019m someone who makes decisions based on the data,\u201d she told him. By contrast, Zepeda claimed Obrador could sacrifice data for party loyalty. \u201cIf (a piece of) data gets in the way, another piece is chosen,\u201d he said, whereas Sheinbaum allows herself to be guided by the science. Obrador will leave office with broad support and an impressive record of alleviating poverty, but his premiership was marred by his \u201chugs, not bullets\u201d policy of not confronting cartels, allowing violence to spiral. Violence has loomed large in this election, the bloodiest in Mexico\u2019s history. Dozens of political candidates and applicants have been killed by criminal organizations\u00a0trying to influence\u00a0those coming into power. Mexico\u2019s\u00a0homicide rate\u00a0is among the highest in the world, and\u00a0more than 100,000 people remain missing in the country. It also remains a dangerous place to be a woman, with\u00a0sky-high femicide\u00a0rates for\u00a0the region \u2013 with figures showing around 10 women\u00a0are murdered every day. Sheinbaum will have to act quickly on Mexico\u2019s organized crime and security issues, said Will Freeman, a fellow for Latin America studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cIt\u2019s stunning that the governing party could win re-election by a landslide as it seems\u2026 given the sweeping violence, the thing is the opposition didn\u2019t seem to put\u00a0together a much more credible\u00a0set of proposals about what\u00a0they would do,\u201d Freeman said. Sheinbaum comes with a team from her time as Mexico City mayor that has a proven record on improving security but it remains to be seen if she can replicate that on a national scale, Freeman said. US-Mexico relations Both Mexico and the US are holding elections in 2024, something that happens only once every 12 years \u2013 and comes at a time of transition in the relationship between the two countries. Sheinbaum will assume office just a month before Americans head to the polls in November, where immigration is a top issue on the ballot for Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Mexico is a key US ally on a range of issues, from trade to cracking down on drug trafficking to managing migration. Current and former US officials have frequently described the relationship between President Joe Biden and Mexico\u2019s President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador as friendly and professional \u2014 and anticipate a productive relationship with Mexico\u2019s next president. But Mexico\u2019s election also comes at a critical time for the Biden administration. In recent months, the US has relied heavily on Mexico to step up immigration enforcement and help stem the flow of migration to the US southern border. The election in Mexico has raised uncertainty in the minds of some Biden officials about what, if anything, will change with a key partner when it comes to border cooperation. One of the considerations in rolling out a new border executive action was doing so after Mexico\u2019s election. The administration will likely need buy-in and assistance from Mexico to execute the order. Officials expect that a new administration in Mexico would likely continue cooperating with the US on migration given years of partnership, but it\u2019s unclear how migrants \u2014 and especially, smugglers \u2014 might plot their next moves in a moment of government transition.

{"id": "2024_06_02_middleeast_israeli-ministers-biden-ceasefire-plan-intl", "text": "Two far-right Israeli ministers have threatened to resign and bring down the governing coalition of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu if he accepts a peace proposal laid out by US President Joe Biden. Biden unveiled on Friday what he said was a three-phase Israeli proposal to end the conflict in Gaza that would pair a release of hostages with a \u201cfull and complete ceasefire.\u201d During a speech at the White House, Biden said Hamas had been degraded to a point where it could no longer carry out the type of attack seen on October 7 that launched the current war in Gaza. \u201cIt\u2019s time\u00a0for this war to end,\u201d he said, a clear indication that \u2013 as far as he is concerned \u2013 Israel\u2019s war goals have been met. But the Israeli government\u2019s two most prominent far-right members, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, made it explicitly clear they reject an immediate ceasefire. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has also signaled he is not ready either, casting doubt over Biden\u2019s proposal. In a statement on social media, Smotrich said he had \u201cmade it clear\u201d to Netanyahu that he would not \u201cbe part of a government that will agree to the proposed outline and end the war without destroying Hamas and returning all the hostages.\u201d Smotrich demanded the fighting to continue until the \u201cdestruction of Hamas and the return of all the hostages,\u201d as well as the \u201ccreation of a completely different security reality in Gaza and Lebanon.\u201d National Security Minister Ben Gvir meanwhile described the deal as \u201creckless\u201d and \u201ca victory for terrorism,\u201d as well as a security danger to Israel. \u201cIf the prime minister implements the reckless deal under the conditions published today, which mean the end of the war and the giving up on the elimination of Hamas, Otzma Yehudit will dissolve the government,\u201d he said, referring to the far-right party he leads and which helps prop up Netanyahu\u2019s majority in parliament. Biden had alluded to the tensions in the Israeli government in his speech, making a direct appeal to ordinary Israelis to voice their support. \u201cI know there are those in Israel who will not agree with this plan and will call for the war to continue indefinitely. Some, some are even in the government coalition,\u201d he said. Netanyahu under pressure The proposal would first see hostages freed and Israel withdrawing from \u201call populated areas of Gaza,\u201d and eventually culminate in a reconstruction plan for Gaza, which has been left in ruins from the fighting. The plan has been widely welcomed, with the UN and other international powers urging Israel and Hamas to accept it. Hamas said it viewed the plan \u201cpositively\u201d and was ready \u201cto deal positively and constructively with any proposal based on a permanent ceasefire.\u201d Less than an hour after Biden detailed the proposal, Netanyahu insisted Israel will not end the war in Gaza until it had achieved all of its goals, including the destruction of Hamas. The extent to which Netanyahu agrees with the plan is unclear, as the statement also said that the \u201cexact outline\u201d of Israel\u2019s proposal allows Israel to \u201cmaintain these\u00a0principles.\u201d On Sunday, the Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant warned Israel will \u201cnot accept\u201d any deal to end the war which would allow Hamas to rule over Gaza. During a visit to the Israeli military\u2019s Southern Command headquarters on Sunday, Gallant said options for a \u201cgoverning alternative to Hamas\u201d are being considered. \u201cWe will not accept the rule of Hamas in Gaza at any stage in any process aimed at ending the war,\u201d Gallant said, according to a readout from his office. However, Hamas has made it clear it will not accept any other group governing Gaza. On May 16, the group\u2019s political leader Ismail Haniyeh noted that, in regards to \u201cthe day after the war,\u201d there had been \u201ccalls to remove Hamas.\u201d \u201cWe say that Hamas is here to stay,\u201d Haniyeh responded. On Sunday the White House National Security Council spokesperson John\u00a0Kirby said the administration was currently \u201cwaiting for an official response from Hamas\u201d on the Israeli ceasefire proposal. Pressed on whether there would be a situation in which Hamas would agree to the proposal but Israel would not, speaking on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d Kirby said that the Biden administration has \u201cevery expectation\u201d that Israel would agree. \u201cWe have every expectation that if Hamas agrees to the proposal, as was transmitted to them, an Israeli proposal, that Israel would say yes,\u201d Kirby added. Netanyahu faces pressure from more than just within his own coalition. On Saturday protesters again took to the streets, demanding his resignation and early elections. Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid has offered to back Netanyahu in accepting the proposal, and condemned the comments by Smotrich and Ben Gvir. \u201cThe threats of Ben Gvir and Smotrich are the neglect of national security, of the hostages and of the residents of the north and the south,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the worst and most reckless government in the country\u2019s history. For them, there will be a war here forever, zero responsibility, zero management, a complete failure. Netanyahu\u2019s government is facing growing international calls to end the war in Gaza as the conflict approaches its ninth month. The war was triggered by Hamas attacks on Israeli civilians on October 7, which left around 1,200 people dead and saw more than 200 people taken hostage. The Israeli campaign in Gaza since then has killed more than 36,000 people.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/02/middleeast/israeli-ministers-biden-ceasefire-plan-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_29_africa_south-africa-elections-polls-open-intl", "text": "Millions of South Africans are voting in what is expected to be the most pivotal general election since the end of apartheid. For months, polls have shown the ruling African National Congress (ANC) party could lose its majority for the first time since Nelson Mandela led it to power in 1994. While polling can be challenging in South Africa, most analysts believe that the ANC faces its stiffest challenge yet with a population deeply frustrated by the country\u2019s direction. If support for the ANC drops below 50% for the first time, the party will be forced to enter into a coalition government. ANC leader and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa called Wednesday\u2019s vote \u201cone of the most important elections in our nation\u2019s history,\u201d while addressing a crowd of thousands at Soweto\u2019s FNB soccer stadium on Saturday. \u201cOur people will decide whether our country continues moving forward with the ANC towards a better, brighter future or backwards to a terrible past,\u201d Ramaphosa said. The South African leader, who cast his ballot at a polling station in Soweto, told reporters on Wednesday that he has \u201cno doubt whatsoever\u201d that voters will again trust in the ANC. \u201cThis is the day when South Africa decides, decides on the future of our country, (on) who should lead the government of South Africa, and I have no doubt whatsoever in my heart of hearts that the people will once again invest confidence in the African National Congress to continue to lead this country,\u201d Ramaphosa\u00a0said. South Africa is the most unequal country in the world, according to the World Bank. Citizens are also contending with the highest sustained rate of unemployment in the world, rampant corruption, feeble economic growth, crippling power cuts and\u00a0rising violent crime. Black South Africans, who make up 81% of the population, are at the sharp end of this dire situation. Unemployment and poverty remain concentrated in the Black majority, in large part due to the\u00a0failure of public schooling, while most White South Africans have jobs and command considerably higher wages. Voters in Johannesburg told CNN they headed to vote shortly after polls opened at 7 a.m. local time (1 a.m. ET) on Wednesday, and many expressed their hopes that the country would move in a different direction. \u201cWe want to see the change,\u201d said Sydney Radebe. \u201cThis is a rich country but people don\u2019t have anything,\u201d the 66-year-old actor and filmmaker added. \u201cWe don\u2019t have land, we don\u2019t have property\u2026 you cannot own nothing and say you are \u2018free.\u2019\u201d Radebe was among the first early morning voters at one of the biggest polling stations in Johannesburg. On a crisp morning as the Southern Hemisphere heads into winter, the line of voters gradually began to grow inside Joubert Park. Events worker Newton Ugboh, 20, was voting for the first time. \u201cI\u2019m looking for change so I came early in the morning,\u201d he said. Ugboh said that some of his friends didn\u2019t want to vote as \u201cthey think things aren\u2019t going to change at all,\u201d but that there are \u201cbig issues\u201d facing young people in the country. The \u201cunemployment rate is crazy,\u201d he said, adding that it\u2019s a \u201cbig-time struggle to find work, most of my friends are unemployed.\u201d Healthcare worker Roselyne Tswakae, 46, said she\u2019s worried about the future of South Africa\u2019s youth and also believes \u201cit\u2019s time for change.\u201d \u201cYoung South Africans were promised that education would be the key to success, they went to university but they are unemployed and often end up getting involved in drugs, drinking, smoking,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are hoping for the light,\u201d Tswakae added. Land surveyor David Ngobeni, 31, also said \u201cthere isn\u2019t much hope\u201d for young people in South Africa. He says unemployment, inflation, crime and corruption are the \u201cbig issues facing everyone right now.\u201d \u201cIf you have a job, you are very lucky,\u201d Ngobeni told CNN. He added that he hopes the outcome of this election will lead to inflation going down and boost the economy. At the very end of a long line in Joubert Park was 40-year-old Ncumisa Xabanisa. She said she has been voting for the same party since 1994 and is very loyal to the ANC. \u201cit\u2019s only one party for me, it\u2019s from home, it\u2019s from my grandmother, I grew up knowing them,\u201d Xabanisa told CNN. She said the major problem the country is facing is a lack of jobs. \u201cSome of us we went to school, we graduated but we have the certificates like it\u2019s a display. It\u2019s hurting.\u201d The mother-of-two added that she is educated but is currently sitting at home most of the time, and sells plastic food containers to make a living. There are 52 parties on this election\u2019s national ballot, including new parties formed by previous ANC members such as former President Jacob Zuma\u2019s uMkhonto weSizwe Party (MK). Zuma was forced to\u00a0resign as president in 2018\u00a0and served a brief stint in jail in 2021 for contempt of court. The 82-year-old was barred from running for parliament last week after the country\u2019s Constitutional Court ruled that five years must have elapsed since the completion of his sentence. However, his party will still contest the election and his face will remain on the ballot. Capping off a heated few months of election campaigning, many of the largest parties held their final rallies this weekend, including the Democratic Alliance (DA), the official opposition party. \u201cOn Wednesday, the ANC will lose the outright majority it has abused for decades to subject the people of this country to unemployment, corruption and misrule\u2026 we close the ANC chapter of our history,\u201d DA leader John Steenhuisen told supporters in the town of Benoni, east of Johannesburg. The DA has formed a coalition bloc with smaller opposition parties called the Multi-Party Charter. This is the seventh general election South Africa has held since the end of white minority rule 30 years ago. A record 27.79 million people are registered to vote \u2013 the highest number to date, according to the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC.) The country\u2019s electoral commission (IEC) said that, by 11 a.m. in South Africa, a \u201csignificant majority\u201d of voters had already cast their ballots, as lines to vote had formed before the polls opened. \u201cThis, we think, is testament to the enthusiasm of South Africans to record their political choice,\u201d the IEC\u2019s deputy CEO Masego Sheburi added during a briefing at the National Results Center. Sheburi said that some voting stations opened late, but by midday \u201cgood progress\u201d was made with \u201cminimal incidences\u201d across the country. One of the issues some polling stations faced was late delivery of ballot papers, mainly in the Johannesburg area, according to the IEC.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/africa/south-africa-elections-polls-open-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_31_europe_donald-trump-conviction-european-allies-reaction-intl", "text": "European allies of former US President Donald Trump have rallied around him in support following his historic conviction on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. The conviction \u2013 which has been heralded as a somber moment for America with wide-reaching implications \u2013 has been painted by Trump\u2019s allies in Europe as political persecution, aimed at derailing his bid to return to White House. Italy\u2019s Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini called Trump\u2019s conviction \u201cjudicial harassment\u201d in a post on X, while Hungarian President Viktor Orban urged him to \u201ckeep on fighting\u201d for the presidency. But other countries declined to comment on the development \u2013 a conventional response for governments when asked about another nation\u2019s domestic matters. A Manhattan jury\u00a0found Trump guilty\u00a0of all 34 charges\u00a0of falsifying business records on Thursday, an unprecedented verdict that makes\u00a0him the first former president in American history to be convicted of a felony. The\u00a0verdict\u00a0was announced after jurors deliberated for nearly 12 hours over two days. It will ultimately be up to voters in November to decide the significance of the guilty verdict delivered by 12 ordinary New Yorkers, which, on a legal basis, does not prevent him from being elected president again. Salvini, who is a long-time supporter of the former president and visited him in Philadelphia,\u00a0Pennsylvania during his first presidential campaign, said Trump was a \u201cvictim of judicial harassment and a process of political nature.\u201d He wrote on X that \u201cin Italy, we are sadly familiar with the weaponization of the justice system by the left,\u201d which he said has for years tried to \u201celiminate political opponents through legal means.\u201d \u201cI hope Trump wins; it would be a guarantee of greater balance and hope for world peace,\u201d he added. Orb\u00e1n said he knew Trump to be \u201ca man of honour.\u201d \u201cAs president, he always put America first, he commanded respect around the world and used this respect to build peace,\u201d he said Friday in a\u00a0post\u00a0on \u2018X\u2019. \u201cLet the people make their verdict this November! Keep on fighting, Mr. President!\u201d he added. Meanwhile, Russia suggested there was a political conspiracy at play, despite Trump being convicted by a jury. \u201cIn general, if we talk about Trump, it is obvious that political rivals are being eliminated there through all legal and illegal means,\u201d President Vladimir Putin\u2019s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said in a daily call to journalists. \u201cThis is visible to the whole world with the naked eye.\u201d Other countries, sticking to protocol, declined to comment on Trump\u2019s conviction. Asked in a press briefing Friday whether he would potentially be willing to work with a convicted felon, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak avoided the question, stating that his focus was \u201csquarely on the election here at home, talking to people across the country about the choice at our election.\u201d Germany\u2019s Foreign Office spokesperson Christian Wagner, meanwhile, told journalists in a daily briefing: \u201cWe do not comment on this.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/europe/donald-trump-conviction-european-allies-reaction-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_30_europe_spanish-parliament-amnesty-law-catalan-intl", "text": "The Spanish parliament has approved a controversial amnesty law that paves the way for hundreds of people facing prosecution for their roles in the failed independence bid in Catalonia to be pardoned. The Socialist Party of Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez put forward the amnesty last year as a way of securing the support of Catalan separatist parties after inconclusive elections. The government has portrayed the bill as a way of moving on from the crisis of 2017, when separatist leaders attempted to push forward with Catalan secession with a referendum ruled illegal by Spain\u2019s Constitutional Court and followed it up by declaring independence. The bill has infuriated Spain\u2019s right, triggering large protests. But it passed by 177 votes in favor to 172 against, helped by crucial support from two Catalan separatist parties, Junts (Together) and Esquerra Republicana (Republican Left). After the vote, Sanchez said in a social media post that \u201cin politics, as in life, forgiveness is more powerful than resentment.\u201d Spain\u2019s main opposition conservative Popular Party and the far-right Vox party voted against the measure. Just before the vote, the Madrid regional government president Isabel Diaz Ayuso, of the Popular Party, vowed to appeal against the new law to Spain\u2019s Constitutional Court, the highest in the land. Spain\u2019s amnesty law would benefit 309 people facing prosecution for their roles in the failed Catalan independence bid, including political leaders. In addition to them, 73 police officers would be covered by the amnesty\u00a0after they faced charges for their actions while trying to defend the law and the Constitution, a government source at the prime minister\u2019s compound told CNN last November. The amnesty law would also allow exiled independence leader Carles Puigdemont, of the Junts party, to return to Spain, as he would no longer face judicial charges. In addition, Oriol Junqueras, of the Catalan separatist Esquerra Republicana party, would no longer be barred from holding public office, a government source told CNN last November. Puigdemont is a former president of the Catalan regional government who fled to Belgium in October 2017 after the failed independence bid. He participated in talks with a top S\u00e1nchez aide\u00a0in Belgium last November to secure the votes of his Junts party\u2019s seven seats in Spanish parliament for Sanchez\u2019s investiture. Oriol Junqueras is a former vice president of the Catalan regional government who was arrested in Spain\u00a0in November 2017 and later sentenced to 13 years in prison for his role in the independence attempt, the Esquerra Republicana party\u2019s website says. Junqueras\u00a0was pardoned in 2021 by S\u00e1nchez\u2019s Socialist government, along with some other jailed independence leaders. The Esquerra Republicana party\u2019s seven seats in Spanish parliament also voted for Sanchez\u2019s investiture last November. S\u00e1nchez\u00a0and Socialist leaders have said the amnesty law would help close the conflict in the sharply divided Catalan society and pave a way forward for the wealthy region in northeastern Spain. But leaders of the conservative Popular Party, Alberto Nu\u00f1ez Feijoo, and the Vox party, Santiago Abascal, both criticized the government\u2019s move, calling it \u201cpolitical corruption,\u201d in their respective speeches in parliament Thursday against the law. They said it amounted to a deal for Sanchez to stay in power\u00a0in exchange for concessions to the Catalan separatists. The legislation will take effect when it\u2019s published \u201cin the coming days\u201d in the Official State Bulletin, Felix Bola\u00f1os, Minister of Justice and a top aide to Sanchez, told reporters at parliament after the vote. Asked about the planned appeal by the conservative Madrid regional government against the new law, Bola\u00f1os said that Spain \u201cis a state of law that guarantees the right of appeal.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/europe/spanish-parliament-amnesty-law-catalan-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "world"}}

But\u00a0when\u00a0she formally takes office in October,\u00a0how\u00a0will\u00a0she\u00a0tackle the biggest challenges facing the country as concerns about its security and the future of its democracy loom large? Complicating her administration\u2019s debut,\u00a0Sheinbaum will also have to contend with the shadow of her polarizing mentor, the outgoing President Andres Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, from the same Morena party. Sunday\u2019s vote was widely seen as a referendum on L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s term. And while his popular social welfare policies have helped push many Mexicans above the poverty line, experts say his security measures have done little to address the expanding reach of organized crime in the country. In a speech following the election, Sheinbaum promised to govern for all and to be an investor-friendly president. \u201cWe know that dissent is part of democracy. And although the majority of the people support our project, our duty is and will always be to look after each and every one of the Mexicans without distinction,\u201d she said as she struck a conciliatory tone at the end of the highly partisan race. \u201cSo, although many Mexicans do not fully agree with our project, we will have to walk in peace and harmony to continue building a fair and more prosperous Mexico.\u201d She promised a government \u201cwithout corruption or impunity\u201d and guided by \u201crepublican austerity, financial and fiscal discipline and autonomy of the Bank of Mexico.\u201d A victory for the Morena party While Sheinbaum\u2019s victory was widely expected this weekend, the \u201cbiggest story of last night\u201d was that the Morena party looked set to gain supermajorities in both houses of Congress,\u00a0said\u00a0Carin Zissis, a Mexico expert, and editor-in-chief of the Americas Society/Council\u2019s website. On Monday morning, the Mexican peso slipped roughly 3% against the US dollar amid rising concern that the ruling party will have a clear path to pass controversial constitutional reforms sought by L\u00f3pez Obrador. The reforms include a range of issues in areas like pensions and the energy sector, but they also include controversial judicial and institutional reforms,\u00a0which critics say\u00a0would weaken the separation of powers and see the disappearance of some independent regulatory agencies. \u201cWe have to see what happens when she comes into office: There has been a history of Mexican presidents breaking the path of their predecessors, even when their predecessors more or less selected them,\u201d Zissis said, adding: \u201cThough, [Sheinbaum] has pledged throughout her campaign to continue his legacy.\u201d L\u00f3pez Obrador has pushed back on suggestions that he would be giving Sheinbaum cues, saying on Monday that he would not \u201cinfluence\u201d his prot\u00e9g\u00e9.\u00a0Sheinbaum is now \u201cthe one empowered to make all the decisions,\u201d he said. One of Sheinbaum\u2019s biographers, journalist Jorge Zepeda, has\u00a0speculated\u00a0that, once in office, Sheinbaum will unfurl her own platform gradually: she will first act as \u201cthe faithful disciple of the leader,\u201d before offering \u201cglimpses\u201d of her own program, taking care not to stoke instability in the movement\u2019s base. Gang violence and security Violence has dominated this year\u2019s election, with dozens of candidates murdered in the run-up to the vote and gangs trying to influence who was coming to power. Sheinbaum inherits a tragic epidemic of unsolved disappearances in the country:\u00a0More than 100,000 Mexicans and migrants have disappeared, with no explanation of their fate for families.\u00a0According to the think tank\u00a0Mexico Evalua,\u00a0around 95%\u00a0of all crimes nationwide\u00a0went unsolved\u00a0in the country in\u00a02022. Mexico also remains a dangerous place to be a woman and is \u201csadly, known for high levels of femicide gender-based violence where the number of disappeared women has gone up and up year to year,\u201d Stephanie Brewer, Mexico Director at the Washington Office for Latin America (WOLA), told CNN. With security at the top of voters\u2019 concerns, Sheinbaum\u00a0has pointed to her record as Mexico City mayor, with her team crediting her for improvements to the police\u2019s pay, working conditions and intelligence-gathering capabilities \u2013 although there is some debate as to how much impact these measures had on bringing down the crime rate, experts said. But will\u00a0Sheinbaum\u2019s tactics as mayor of\u00a0Mexico City\u00a0be replicable\u00a0at the federal level and in Mexico\u2019s 31 states, home to more than 126 million people?\u00a0She will have to tackle a landscape\u00a0where criminal groups have expanded their reach. An hour away from Mexico City, in the state of Morelos, Will Freeman, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said he was told that organized criminal groups had \u201ctheir own political candidates\u201d in the town of Cuautla who could rely on armed wings to intimidate other people. Gangs in the country have also diversified to sectors beyond the illicit manufacture of drugs.\u00a0\u201cThey\u2019re doing illegal logging, illegal mining. They\u2019re taking control of the water supply, which is increasingly scarce,\u201d Freeman said. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s\u00a0term saw the expansion of the militarization of public security to tackle crime, a two-decades-long approach that\u00a0has coincided with historically high levels of homicides. A\u00a0May\u00a0report by the Crisis Group\u00a0found official corruption and collusion was hampering effective law enforcement. (CNN has yet to receive comment from Mexican Secretary of Defense and the president\u2019s office over the findings.) Sheinbaum has largely remained coy about her security programs, but has said \u201cthat at the national level we can advance even more in terms of security,\u201d she said in a\u00a0tweet on X, which listed out her security strategy that included the consolidation of the National Guard, strengthened intelligence and research, and better\u00a0coordination between the police, state prosecutors\u2019 offices and the attorney general\u2019s office. Where Washington and Mexico City meet Sheinbaum has\u00a0previously signaled\u00a0the importance of the US-Mexico relationship, especially around trade. \u201cWith the United States there will be a relationship of friendship, respect, mutual respect and equality as it has been until now, and we will always defend the Mexicans who are on the other side of the border,\u201d she said late on Sunday, local time. But analysts note there will probably be differences between US and Mexico when it comes to foreign policy.\u00a0Sheinbaum is from the ideological and political left, and \u201cI think she will be as friendly as L\u00f3pez Obrador towards Cuba, Venezuela, Nicaragua [and] will not probably take the geopolitical positions the US would hope for\u201d over Gaza and Ukraine, Freeman said. L\u00f3pez Obrador has angered advocates\u00a0on both sides\u00a0of the Israel and Gaza conflict.\u00a0Mexico has ruled out breaking diplomatic relations with Israel, in contrast to some of its Latin American counterparts, but it has also sought to join South Africa\u2019s genocide case against Israel. Sheinbaum\u00a0condemned\u00a0the violence following Hamas\u2019 October 7 attack on Israel and has\u00a0previously\u00a0called for a Palestinian state. In a 2009 letter to the editor of a Mexican newspaper, Sheinbaum wrote that many of her relatives from her grandparent\u2019s generation \u201cwere exterminated in the concentration camps.\u201d She added that \u201cbecause of my Jewish origin, because of my love for Mexico and because I feel like a citizen of the world, I share with millions the desire for justice, equality, fraternity and peace, and therefore, I can only see with horror the images of the state bombings,\u201d referring to an Israeli bombing campaign of Gaza that year. \u201cNo reason justifies the murder of Palestinian civilians,\u201d she wrote in\u00a0La Jornada. A partner to the US on migration? Sheinbaum will assume office just a month before Americans head to the polls in November, where immigration is a top issue on the ballot for candidates President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump \u2013\u00a0both of whom have\u00a0relied heavily on Mexico to step up immigration enforcement and help stem the flow of migration to the US southern border. While migration across the countries\u2019 1,933 miles long border is a shared concern,\u00a0migration is not a major issue among Mexican voters, Zissis said. Still, under L\u00f3pez Obrador, the Mexican government has accepted US deportations of tens of thousands of non-Mexican citizens under a 2023 Biden administration rule. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s administration\u00a0also stepped up efforts to block the path of migrants heading to the US by transporting large numbers of people from the north of Mexico to the south. But while Mexico\u2019s policies may have become a \u201cmajor factor\u201d\u00a0in reducing\u00a0some\u00a0migrant crossing\u00a0at\u00a0the United States\u2019 southern border, Brewer said it is \u201cnot a sustainable model for anyone\u201d \u2013 especially\u00a0not for\u00a0migrants who\u00a0are often targeted for\u00a0violence in Mexico. Will Sheinbaum keep up Mexico\u2019s assistance to US immigration policy?\u00a0The transition of power\u00a0is likely now\u00a0raising\u00a0uncertainty in the minds of some Biden officials about what\u00a0could\u00a0change\u00a0with its key partner\u00a0at the border.

{"id": "travel_fog-mist-airplane-humidity-explainer", "text": "It\u2019s a phenomenon you might be familiar with if you\u2019ve ever boarded an airplane on a humid day. Hot, muggy air from the outside meets the cool air on the inside that\u2019s blasting from the aircraft air conditioning vents \u2013 temporarily creating what looks like mist or fog inside the cabin. A couple weeks ago, TikTok user Savannah Gowarty posted a video of inflight mist and condensation on a domestic US flight. The video garnered over 13.1 million views, with amazed and confused commentators questioning what was going on. Short answer: it\u2019s a natural occurrence that usually only lasts a short while, and it\u2019s nothing to worry about. \u201cOn hot and relatively humid days, cold air from the aircraft\u2019s air conditioning system mixes with the warmer, humid cabin air and lowers it to the dew point, creating fog,\u201d a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) spokesperson tells CNN Travel.\u00a0 \u201cThe fog is generally short-lived as the cooled air quickly warms above the dew point.\u201d Scientific explanation When an airplane is waiting on the ground pre-departure, the aircraft cabin air is kept cool \u201ceither from an external ground air conditioning unit or the aircraft\u2019s own Auxiliary Power Unit (APU),\u201d as the FAA spokesperson explains. \u201cBoth provide cold air (usually much cooler than the ambient temperature) which can temporarily lower the dew point of the aircraft cabin air enough to create fog.\u201d Climate scientist Indrani Roy, who works at University College London, says that the environment on board an airplane also creates perfect conditions for condensation in the cabin. That\u2019s why cabin surfaces \u2013 and people \u2013 might feel damp. Condensation occurs when water vapor in the air - which is \u201cprone to sticking,\u201d as Roy puts it \u2013 comes into contact with any cooler solid surfaces, and there are plenty of solid surfaces inside an aircraft. \u201cHence condensation is more likely in the cold solid surface areas of the cabin,\u201d Roy says. Roy also emphasizes that neither mist nor any resulting condensation is \u201ccause for alarm.\u201d But although humidity-fueled fog is perfectly safe, passengers can sometimes be \u201cconcerned,\u201d especially when they experience it for the first time, says US-based flight attendant Rich Henderson. It\u2019s usually because they\u2019ve mistaken the fog for smoke, Henderson tells CNN Travel. \u201cBut a quick explanation usually helps to ease any nerves that they may have,\u201d says Henderson, adding that, generally speaking, passengers \u201cdon\u2019t get too upset very often.\u201d \u201cMostly they are just confused about what it is. But once you explain to them it\u2019s just condensation from the cold air of the aircraft\u2019s air conditioning system meeting the warm humid air of the cabin, they understand pretty quickly.\u201d Passengers usually see the humorous side too, Henderson adds. \u201cI usually make a joke that it\u2019s just like we\u2019re in an \u201880\u2019s music video and that usually gets people laughing about it pretty quickly.\u201d Gone in seconds For flight attendants, judging whether passengers would prefer a slightly longer, scientific explanation or a more humorous shorter take is a part of their skillset they hone on the job. Henderson says such people skills aren\u2019t something that\u2019s particularly really taught in training, but it\u2019s something you quickly pick up on when you\u2019re interacting with different people, with different perspectives, daily. Anything that\u2019s \u201cunfamiliar to passengers can cause some anxiety from time to time,\u201d says Henderson \u2013 pointing to unexplained noises or engine sounds as another culprit. \u201cA simple explanation and a little joke usually does the trick.\u201d So there you have it \u2013 airplane fog is nothing to worry about, and just a chance for you to embrace your inner \u201880s pop star. And while you might be concerned about the fog ruining your blow dry, \u201caircraft cabin fog usually dissipates very quickly,\u201d the FAA spokesperson explains. \u201cThis is due to the colder air (which lowered the cabin air temperature to its dew point) quickly warms back above the dew point. Once that happens, the fog will disappear. Many times, the fog only appears as it comes out of the vent, exists for 1-2 seconds and then is gone.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/fog-mist-airplane-humidity-explainer/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_02_india_india-heatwave-poll-worker-deaths-intl-hnk", "text": "Extreme heat in India has killed at least 77 people over the past 10 days, including dozens of poll workers, as voting wrapped up in the world\u2019s largest general election. India has endured a scorching summer \u2014 with a part of the capital of Delhi recording the country\u2019s highest-ever temperature of 49.9 degrees Celsius (121.8 degrees Fahrenheit) on Tuesday last week \u2014 as voters have hit the polls over a six-week election. At least 33 poll workers died in a single day in India\u2019s most populous state of Uttar Pradesh, the state\u2019s chief election officer, Navdeep Rinwa, told reporters Sunday. Their families will receive $18,000 each in compensation, he said. Despite being fitted out with water dispensers, mist machines and shaded areas, polling stations in Delhi were unusually quiet on Saturday, the penultimate day of voting. For some, casting a ballot was not worth the risk. Others urged eligible voters to try and tolerate the heat. Standing on the sweltering streets, a Delhi resident called Haseem told CNN that voting is \u201ca fundamental right and the foremost duty for every citizen of any republic or any democracy. We should be coming out, whatever the weather.\u201d A woman selling lemonade on the streets of Delhi told the AFP French news agency: \u201cThe heat is so harsh here, that when the wind comes, it feels like someone is slapping your face.\u201d With the peak of summer still weeks away, temperatures are expected to rise further. \u201cI don\u2019t know what we will do,\u201d she said. Home to more than 1.4 billion people, about 969 million Indians were eligible to cast their vote in the election \u2014 more than the populations of North America and the European Union combined. Around 642 million showed up, the most ever to participate, Chief Election Commissioner Rajiv Kumar told a press conference on Monday. Voters and election workers have endured an extended period of extreme heat since polls opened on April 19, in a mammoth democratic exercise that ended Sunday. Polls suggest Prime Minister Narenda Modi will secure a rare third consecutive term in office, with results expected Tuesday. To carry out such a huge election, India relies on a network of some 15 million polling officials and security staff, with some of these election workers traveling via road, boat, camel, train and helicopter to reach citizens across the vast nation. But the event has been marred by the deaths of dozens of poll workers and voters. Some 20 people were reported dead due to \u201csun stroke\u201d between May 31 and June 2 in the eastern state of Odisha, according to the state\u2019s disaster management agency. \u201cIn Odisha we have been experiencing severe temperatures the last few days, the heat here isn\u2019t as high as northern India but here high humidity is also a factor,\u201d Satyabrata Sahu, Odisha\u2019s special relief commissioner told CNN Monday. Sahu said rainfall over the weekend could reduce the heat in the coming days. Another 24 people died across the capital territory of Delhi, the eastern Indian states of Bihar and Jharkhand and the western Indian state of Rajasthan since May 24, local officials said. Election duty is compulsory in India for public sector employees, who are assigned by the election commission before polling begins. \u201cHeat wave conditions over Northwest, Central & East India are likely to continue with reduced intensity during next 3 days,\u201d the Indian Meteorological Department said on Sunday. India is among the countries expected to be worst affected by the climate crisis, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), threatening its development while risking reversing its progress on poverty alleviation, health and economic growth. The country often experiences heat waves during the summer months of May and June, but in recent years they have arrived earlier and become more prolonged. Experts say the climate crisis is only going to cause more frequent and longer heat waves in the future, testing India\u2019s ability to adapt.

{"id": "style_worlds-largest-3d-printer-homes-maine-hnk-spc-intl", "text": "Dozens of 3D-printed homes have been built across the world \u2013 to house a family in the US state of Virginia or members of an impoverished community in rural Mexico. The world\u2019s largest 3D-printed neighborhood is currently under construction outside of Austin, Texas. The technology could be especially handy in a place like the US state of Maine, where approximately 80,000 new homes will be needed by 2030 to address a shortage, according to a report released last year by three state agencies. \u201cPeople can\u2019t find homes, they\u2019re very expensive. We also have an aging population \u2026 so there\u2019s less and less people who are electricians, plumbers, or builders,\u201d Habib Dagher, the executive director of the University of Maine\u2019s Advanced Structures and Composites Center (ASCC), told CNN via video call. He says he\u2019s got a solution. Last month, the ASCC unveiled what it says is the world\u2019s largest polymer 3D printer. Dagher hopes the-so-called \u201cFactory of the Future 1.0\u201d can help address the state\u2019s housing crisis \u2013 and revolutionize 3D-home-printing in the process. \u201cThe approach we\u2019ve taken is quite different from what you\u2019ve seen, and you\u2019ve been reading about for years,\u201d he says. A home every 48 hours In recent years, 3D-printing has been used to build everything from businesses to bridges to mosques. One non-profit is even working on printing schools in a war zone. Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, holds the Guinness World Record for the world\u2019s biggest 3D-printed structure and aims to have 25% of new buildings constructed with 3D printing technology by 2030. A great majority of current printing relies on concrete, with a robotic arm equipped with a nozzle layering wet concrete into the right shape. ASCC is flipping the script. Its giant printer, and its predecessor, which in 2019 was certified by Guinness World Records as the \u201clargest prototype polymer 3D printer,\u201d are the only printers building homes with wood residuals, says Dagher. The technology has already been tested. In late 2022, the university unveiled the \u201cBioHome3D,\u201d a 600-square-foot single-family unit which it says is the world\u2019s first 100% bio-based 3D-printed home, built from local wood fiber and bio-resin materials. \u201cWhen they\u2019re doing concrete, they\u2019re only printing the walls,\u201d says Dagher. He adds that the floor, roof and walls of the BioHome3D were all printed. Concrete homes also need to be built on site, he says. That can be problematic, especially during the snowy New England winter. \u201cWhen the weather goes bad for two weeks at a time, you can\u2019t print,\u201d he adds. By contrast, ASCC printed prefabricated modules at the university and bolted them together on site to create BioHome3D. The new printer can produce objects as large as 96 feet long by 32 feet wide by 18 feet\u202fhigh and can print up to 500 pounds per hour. Dagher says that the goal is to be able to print 1,000 pounds of material in an hour. At that rate, it could reproduce the BioHome3D in 48 hours, he says. If they can reach that target, their 3D-printed homes will be \u201cvery competitive with current housing construction costs,\u201d he adds. But it can be difficult to process wood materials at such a high speed. Even ASCC\u2019s record-breaking printers sometimes jam. While printing BioHome3D, for example, the printer stopped working due to a dust buildup. \u201cNobody\u2019s ever done this before with these kinds of materials,\u201d says Dagher. \u2018When can I have one?\u2019 The BioHome3D\u2019s warm wooden floors and walls give it the look of a sleek, modern Scandinavian-inspired log cabin. \u201cMany people feel concrete is a cold thing to look at and it\u2019s not necessarily where you want to live,\u201d says Dagher. The BioHome3D, however, is \u201cvery warm and inviting.\u201d It\u2019s also sustainable. When a home is no longer needed or wanted it can be ground up and used to print something else. ASCC is using wood residuals from Maine\u2019s sawmills in its research, and looking into scaling up production using these local byproducts. Thousands of people have toured the prototype on the university\u2019s Orono, Maine campus, and Dagher says it\u2019s a rare occurrence when a visitor doesn\u2019t ask, \u201c\u2019When can I have one?\u2019\u201d \u201cWe hear, \u2018You know, I\u2019m retiring, and I want to downsize. Can I put one of these up?\u2019\u201d Dagher says. There are some obstacles to overcome first. \u201cIt takes years for codes to change,\u201d says Dagher, referring to building codes that construction companies must meet. The printer won\u2019t displace traditional home construction, but in the future 3D printed homes are likely to comprise a larger share of the world\u2019s housing stock, he predicts. The ASCC is now doing work on how to incorporate conduits for wiring and plumbing \u201cexactly where an architect would want them\u201d into the printing process, he adds. The printer\u2019s next big project is a nine-home neighborhood for people experiencing homelessness. ASCC is partnering with a local NGO to design the structures, and printing is set to kick off in 2025.", "source": "http://cnn.com/style/worlds-largest-3d-printer-homes-maine-hnk-spc-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "world"}}

The ceremonial display on June 8 is the traditional dress rehearsal for the King\u2019s official birthday parade known as Trooping the Colour, which takes place a week later on June 15. It is not yet clear if Kate will also miss that annual military spectacle \u2013 a highlight of the royal calendar full of pomp and pageantry \u2013 at Horse Guards Parade in the British capital. It had been widely hoped that the popular 42-year-old royal might oversee proceedings at the run-through in her capacity as Colonel of the Irish Guards. The regiment will be trooping its colour \u2013 presenting its regimental flags \u2013 at this year\u2019s ceremony. Lt. Gen. James Bucknall will step in to take the salute in Kate\u2019s absence.

However, in March, she revealed her cancer diagnosis and that she had started chemotherapy. Following the announcement, a royal source told CNN that she would not be returning to frontline royal duties until she has been cleared to do so by her medical team. There had also been speculation over whether King Charles would participate in next month\u2019s Trooping the Colour as he continues his own cancer treatment. However, Buckingham Palace has now confirmed his attendance. In a slight change from last year, the 75-year-old monarch will inspect troops from a carriage rather than on horseback. He will conduct the review in an Ascot Landau carriage seated alongside his wife, Queen Camilla. The adjustment reflects previous guidance from the royal household that each engagement involving the King would be reviewed, with adaptations made based on doctors\u2019 recommendations. Charles announced his own cancer battle in February but recently resumed public-facing royal engagements as he continues his treatment.

{"id": "2024_06_03_middleeast_netanyahu-hostage-deal-government-survival-hamas-analysis-mime-intl", "text": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu may soon be forced to choose: Agree to a ceasefire deal with Hamas or keep his government in power. But as he confronts that choice, Netanyahu is also looking for a way to avoid it altogether. For months, Netanyahu has gingerly balanced these competing imperatives by refusing to even contemplate a permanent ceasefire as he blamed Hamas\u2019s \u201cdelusional demands\u201d for the collapse of previous rounds of negotiations. But after US President Joe Biden publicly outlined Israel\u2019s latest ceasefire proposal on Friday \u2013 one that could lead to a permanent truce and which Hamas may be prepared to accept \u2013 Netanyahu is now out of time. \u201cI think that Bibi is cornered now,\u201d said Aviv Bushinsky, a former adviser to Netanyahu, using the prime minister\u2019s nickname. Biden is \u201cforcing Bibi to take off his mask and say: \u2018OK, now is the money time. Are you in favor of a deal?\u2019,\u201d he said. As Israel awaits Hamas\u2019 response to the latest proposal, National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir and other far-right members of Netanyahu\u2019s coalition are already threatening to bolt from the government and cause its collapse if the prime minister follows through. Amid the chorus of threats from his right flank, Netanyahu is trying to reframe the latest ceasefire proposal, insisting to Ben Gvir and others that the terms of the deal are not as Biden defined them. While Biden squarely framed the proposal as a way to end the war, Netanyahu is insisting Israel will not end the war until and unless Hamas is eliminated. Netanyahu told the Knesset\u2019s Foreign Affairs and Security Committee on Monday that \u201cthe claim that we agreed to a ceasefire without our conditions being met is not true.\u201d He appeared to be referring to the permanent ceasefire outlined in the second phase of the proposal, the conditions of which Israel and Hamas would need to negotiate during the first phase \u2013 a point Netanyahu has sought to emphasize in recent days. According to Biden, the three-phase proposal would pair a release of hostages with a \u201cfull and complete ceasefire.\u201d But Netanyahu\u2019s spokesperson told journalists at a briefing Monday that Biden had presented only a \u201cpartial\u201d outline of the deal Israel had offered Hamas. \u201cThe war will be stopped for the purpose of returning hostages and then we will proceed with further discussions. There are other details that the US President did not present to the public,\u201d the spokesperson added. The spokesperson reiterated Israel\u2019s refusal to agree to any ceasefire until all hostages had been released, until Gaza no longer posed \u201ca threat\u201d to Israel, and until Hamas\u2019s \u201cgoverning and military capabilities\u201d in Gaza had been eradicated. \u201cThe notion that Israel will agree to a permanent ceasefire before these conditions are fulfilled is a non-starter. It\u2019s not an option,\u201d said the spokesperson. Netanyahu\u2019s efforts to convince the far-right ministers in order to avoid choosing between a ceasefire deal and the survival of his government have so far fallen flat. Ben Gvir said Monday that Netanyahu\u2019s office refused to follow through on a commitment to show him the draft proposal, leaving him convinced the prime minister has something to hide. If Ben Gvir or Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich don\u2019t back off their threats to leave the government, Netanyahu will be back to the binary choice that is beginning to materialize before his eyes. Opposition leader Yair Lapid has offered to provide a \u201csafety net\u201d to keep the government in power in order to achieve a ceasefire deal, but doing so would also be handing Lapid the keys to forcing early elections once the deal is implemented. Just as it has been over the past eight months, Netanyahu\u2019s political survival may be wrapped up in the continuation of the war and his elusive pursuit of total victory over Hamas. Netanyahu is confronting the choice between his government\u2019s survival and a hostage deal at a time when his political fortunes have begun to improve. For the first time this year, Netanyahu edged out his chief political rival Benny Gantz as the preferred choice for prime minister for Israelis, 36% to 30%, according to a Channel 12 survey last week. And a smattering of recent polls have shown Gantz\u2019s National Unity party faltering, while Netanyahu\u2019s Likud is making modest gains. National Unity would still win a plurality of seats in the Knesset, Israel\u2019s parliament, but the party\u2019s 19-seat advantage over Likud in December has dropped to a four-seat advantage in last week\u2019s Channel 12 poll. The improvement in Netanyahu\u2019s political standing coincided with a surge of international condemnation of Israel\u2019s war effort in Gaza and the International Criminal Court\u2019s decision to seek an arrest warrant for Netanyahu, all of which have positioned Netanyahu domestically as Israel\u2019s defender, a familiar and comfortable role for Israel\u2019s longest-serving prime minister. Meanwhile, Gantz\u2019s threat to leave the war cabinet over Netanyahu\u2019s lack of long-term strategy in Gaza appears to be the cause of his drop in support. A poll by Israel\u2019s Channel 11 on Monday put the Israeli public\u2019s support for the ceasefire deal currently on the table at 40%, with 27% opposed and 33% unsure. But if Netanyahu is now contemplating whether there is more upside to continuing the war than reaching a ceasefire deal, Biden\u2019s speech last week didn\u2019t just force Netanyahu to confront that choice \u2013 it was also aimed at countering the pressure Netanyahu is now facing to abandon his own government\u2019s proposal. \u201cI know there are those in Israel who will not agree with this plan and will call for the war to continue indefinitely. Some are even in the government coalition,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve urged the leadership in Israel to stand behind this deal, despite whatever pressure comes.\u201d Despite Netanyahu\u2019s remarks that the conditions for ending the war \u201chave not changed,\u201d the US State Department said Monday it was \u201ccompletely confident\u201d Israel would go along with the proposal laid out by Biden. \u201cThe only thing standing in the way of an immediate ceasefire today is Hamas,\u201d Matthew Miller told a press briefing. But one key question remains: Will Hamas force Netanyahu to make the choice he now confronts? Or will Yahya Sinwar, Hamas\u2019s leader in Gaza, offer Netanyahu an escape hatch of his own making? Hamas said it viewed Biden\u2019s speech about the latest Israeli proposal \u201cpositively,\u201d but has yet to submit its official response. While the latest proposal makes major concessions to close the gap with Hamas\u2019s demands \u2013 including by offering a clear pathway to a permanent ceasefire \u2013 it still falls short of meeting all of the demands. It allows an initial 6-week ceasefire period to be extended for as long as the parties need to negotiate a permanent truce that includes the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza in a second phase of the deal. But it does not require Israel to commit to a permanent ceasefire upfront. Hamas\u2019s refusal to compromise on that point and sign off on this deal could let Netanyahu off the hook, and plunge Gaza into many more months of war.

{"id": "2024_05_02_style_aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl", "text": "Miami has a new addition to its skyline \u2013 a 66-story residential tower built by Aston Martin, marking the British luxury sports carmaker\u2019s first foray into the residential real estate market. Comprising of 391 units, Aston Martin Residences Miami sits at the mouth of the Miami River on Biscayne Bay, the firm said in a statement Tuesday. Designed in partnership with architect Rodolfo Miani of Bodas Mian Anger and built by G&G Business Developments, the 249-meter- (818-foot-) tall building houses seven penthouses, each with private pools and terraces, as well as apartments ranging in size from one to five bedrooms. The largest unit is the \u201cUnique Triplex Penthouse,\u201d arranged over three floors at the top of the building, which remains on the market for $59 million. The property was officially opened on Tuesday. Timed to coincide with the Formula One Miami Grand Prix, the company said in a statement that it marks \u201cthe latest distinct expression of Aston Martin\u2019s ultra-luxury high performance brand.\u201d Featuring an infinity pool with a pool deck, jacuzzis and cabanas on the 55th floor, the sail-shaped complex has a two-floor fitness center, two movie theaters and a virtual golf simulator. The building has a sky bar and lounge, chef\u2019s kitchen, ballroom and private dining areas, as well as a spa, beauty salon and barber shop. Direct access to the sea via a superyacht marina is also available, plus a private butler service. Germ\u00e1n Coto, chief executive officer of G&G Business Developments, told CNN Tuesday that the firm wanted to work on a project in the \u201ccosmopolitan city\u201d of Miami, and that this piece of land was the perfect choice. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing plot with an excellent view of the river,\u201d said Coto. The structure\u2019s aerodynamic shape helps the building deal with the technical challenges presented by high winds in the area, as well as evoking the sleek shape of an Aston Martin, according to Marek Reichman, executive vice president and chief creative officer of Aston Martin. It also becomes wider from the base to the mid-section before tightening once more towards the top, making it appear to bow out over people on street level, Reichman told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the drama,\u201d he added. Challenges However, the process wasn\u2019t all plain sailing. \u201cIt was difficult to achieve what we wanted because the space and the plot is kind of small,\u201d said Coto, with the building fitting into a 1.25-acre plot of land. Meanwhile, local building regulations imposed strict standards, explained Reichman, taking into account the low-lying land and propensity for flooding. \u201cThey were some of the most amazing challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to withstand the flooding with the windows that are on street level.\u201d There were further obstacles due to the curved shape of the building, which means that units on the east side have an individual architectural structural component. Aston Martin touches Homeowners are able to customize their interior space with the help of the Aston Martin design team, with three style packages \u2013 Timeless, Covert and Indulgent \u2013 drawing on the company\u2019s British heritage, as well as the building\u2019s context. \u201cIt needs to have part of the DNA of an Aston Martin,\u201d Reichman said. \u201cBut we are in Miami, you don\u2019t have a cold November evening where you need to put the log fire on, so you\u2019ve got to be considerate of the environment that you\u2019re in.\u201d Design elements running through the building include doors with bespoke Aston Martin handles, number plinths and kestrel tan leather door tabs. Aston Martin said that 99% of the properties sold before the building was completed. Residences were sold for $1.5 million to $8.5 million, while penthouses ranged from $16 million to $59 million. The Unique Triplex Penthouse, on the market for $59 million, comes with the last remaining Aston Martin Vulcan, an 820 brake horsepower all-carbon fiber supercar, of which only 24 exist, a spokesman for the company said. Meanwhile, buyers of the 47 Signature and Penthouse units were also able to choose between an Aston Martin DBX sports SUV or the company\u2019s DB11 sportscar. Aston Martin isn\u2019t the first luxury carmaker to enter the residential property market. A 63-story building from Bentley will open in 2026 along the coastline of Sunny Isles Beach, Florida. Featuring 216 units, the property will have an elevator designed to take residents up to their doorstep while seated inside their cars.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/02/style/aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_03_china_tiananmen-square-tank-man-photo-intl-hnk", "text": "The shot is iconic: an unidentified man in a white shirt, hands full of bags, facing off against a column of tanks on Beijing\u2019s Avenue of Eternal Peace, after the Chinese Communist Party ordered a bloody military crackdown on pro-democracy protesters. The photo and footage of the so-called \u201ctank man\u201d became the defining image of the Tiananmen Square crackdown whose 35th anniversary passed on Tuesday. On the night of June 3, 1989, after nearly two months of demonstrations by students and workers demanding faster political reform and an end to corruption, convoys of armed troops entered central Beijing to clear the square. It was a bloodbath; witnesses described tanks driving over unarmed protesters, and soldiers firing indiscriminately into the crowd. To this day the massacre remains one of the most sensitive political taboos in mainland China, with all mention of it strictly censored. Commemoration can lead to imprisonment. Chinese authorities have not released an official death toll, but estimates range from several hundred to thousands. Still, each June 4 since, diaspora communities and surviving protesters in exile around the world have commemorated the event\u00a0\u2013 often resharing the historic photo by Jeff Widener, then a photographer for the Associated Press (AP), as well as footage shot by CNN\u2019s crews. The journey of the photograph, too, captured the tension and fear of the time \u2013 involving smuggling equipment and film past authorities and across borders. By that point, the Chinese government was trying desperately to control the message going out to the world \u2013 and was trying to stop all American news outlets, including CNN, from broadcasting live from Beijing. These interviews, excerpted from \u201cAssignment China: An Oral History of American Journalists in the People\u2019s Republic\u201d by Mike Chinoy, CNN\u2019s Beijing bureau chief during the crackdown, offer the behind-the-scenes story of perhaps the most famous moment in the crisis. Chinoy was there, broadcasting live from a balcony overlooking the scene, and spoke to witnesses during and after the historic event. Sneaking in and smuggling equipment It was Monday, June 5, 1989, and Beijing was reeling from the crackdown the day before. Liu Heung-shing, the photo editor for the AP in Beijing, asked Widener to help get photos of Chinese troops from the Beijing Hotel \u2013 which had the best vantage point of the square, now under military control. Widener had flown in from the news agency\u2019s Bangkok office a week before to help with coverage, and was hurt when the crackdown began, he told CNN previously \u2013 after having been hit in the head by a rock, and laid low with the flu. He set off, with his camera equipment hidden in his jacket \u2013 a long 400-millimeter lens in one pocket, a doubler in another, film in his underwear and the camera body in his back pocket. \u201cI\u2019m biking towards the Beijing Hotel and there\u2019s just debris and charred buses on the ground,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of a sudden, there\u2019s four tanks coming, manned by soldiers with heavy machine guns. I\u2019m on my bicycle thinking I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m doing this.\u201d \u201cI hear rumors that other journalists had had their film and cameras confiscated. I had to figure out a way to get into the hotel,\u201d he added. \u201cI look inside the darkened lobby, and there\u2019s this Western college kid. I walked up to him and whispered, \u2018I\u2019m from Associated Press, can you let me up to your room?\u2019 He picked up on it right away and said, \u2018Sure.\u2019\u201d That young man was Kirk Martsen \u2013 an American exchange student who snuck Widener into his sixth-floor hotel room. From there, Widener began photographing the tanks rolling by on the roads below \u2013 sometimes hearing the ring of a bell that signified a cart passing by with a body, or an injured person being taken to the hospital, he said. Capturing the shot Other journalists were at the hotel, too \u2013 including Jonathan Schaer, CNN\u2019s US-based cameraman who flew into Beijing to support his exhausted colleagues. He\u2019d set up a camera on the balcony of CNN\u2019s room at the hotel, where the network had been broadcasting live reports of the crackdown throughout the weekend. \u201cAnother cameraman said, \u2018Hey, look at the guy in front of the tanks!\u2019 I just zoomed in and started videotaping,\u201d Schaer recalled. \u201cWhen the column stopped and the man blocked the tanks, they were trying to scare him off by shooting over his head. Well, shooting over his head was basically where our position was. The bullets were so close you could hear them whizzing by.\u201d Back in Martsen\u2019s room, Widener was at the window, preparing to photograph the column of tanks coming down the road, when \u201cthis guy with shopping bags walks out in front and starts waving the bags,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just waiting for him to get shot, holding the focus on him, waiting and waiting.\u201d The tank stopped and tried to go around the man. The man moved with the tank, blocking its path once again. At one point during the standoff, the man climbed aboard the lead tank and appeared to speak to whoever was inside. But Widener had a problem \u2013 the scene was too far away for his 400-mm lens. His doubler, which would allow him to zoom in twice as much, lay on the bed, leaving him a choice: Should he go grab the doubler, and risk losing the shot in those precious seconds? He took the chance, got the doubler on the camera, took \u201cone, two, three shots. Then it was over,\u201d he said. \u201cSome people came, grabbed this guy, and ran off. I remember sitting down on this little sofa next to the window and the student (Martsen) said, \u2018Did you get it? Did you get it?\u2019 Something in the back of my mind said maybe I got it, but I\u2019m not sure.\u201d Liu remembers getting the call from Widener, and immediately firing off instructions: roll up the film, go down to the lobby, and ask one of the many foreign students there to bring it to the AP office. The pictures were soon transmitted over telephone lines to the rest of the world. Widener did, sending the student bicycling away with the film hidden in his underwear. Forty-five minutes later, \u201can American guy with a ponytail and a backpack showed up with an AP envelope,\u201d said Liu. They quickly developed the film, \u201cand I looked at that frame \u2013 and that\u2019s the frame. It went out.\u201d Schaer, the CNN photojournalist, didn\u2019t initially realize what they had captured on tape. This was in the early days of email, which didn\u2019t yet handle large video \u2013 so CNN was using a \u201cgizmo that could send video \u2026 a prototype that Sony had given us to try out,\u201d which took an hour to scan one frame of video and send it over a phone line, he said. So they sent five frames, made copies of the tape and sent it to the airport in Beijing \u2013 where they enlisted a tourist to take the tape to Hong Kong, which at the time was still a British colony and not subject to Chinese rule. Several media outlets took a photo of \u201cTank Man,\u201d but Widener\u2019s shot was the most used. It appeared on the front pages of newspapers all around the world, and it was nominated that year for a Pulitzer Prize. Widener said he didn\u2019t know the image had made such an impact until the next morning, when he arrived at the AP office to find messages from viewers and journalists all over the world. To this day, we don\u2019t know who the man is and what happened to him. But he remains a powerful symbol of the individual standing up to the power of the state. \u201cI suppose for a lot of people it\u2019s something personal, because this guy represents everything in our lives that we\u2019re battling, because we\u2019re all battling something,\u201d Widener said. \u201cHe\u2019s really become a symbol for a lot of people.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/china/tiananmen-square-tank-man-photo-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_03_weather_california-heat-dome-wildfires-west-climate", "text": "Daily temperature records will tumble as sizzling early season heat from a summerlike heat dome sends thermometers skyrocketing into the triple digits in parts of California and the West this week. The official start of summer is just a few weeks away, but it will feel like July in much of the West as temperatures climb 20 degrees or more above average, the highest temperatures of the year so far for many locations. Excessive heat warnings are in effect for more than 17 million people in California, Nevada, Utah and Arizona this week. The warnings are the most extreme form of heat alert issued by the National Weather Service and are used when widespread, dangerous heat is expected. The soaring temperatures are being caused by a heat dome, a large area of high pressure that parks over an area, traps air and heats it with abundant sunshine for days or weeks. The resulting heat becomes more intense the longer a heat dome lasts. TELL US: Worried about affording air conditioning this summer? Share your story Dangerous heat will get underway Tuesday afternoon in parts of California and expand its reach into more of the Southwest by Wednesday and as a heat dome parks over the West. It will then reach the Pacific Northwest by late-week. The most extreme heat will avoid major population centers along the coast, but Los Angeles will still be 5 to 10 degrees warmer than normal this week. Temperatures will soar into the upper 90s and low 100s Tuesday in California\u2019s Central Valley \u2013 including where the Corral Fire is burning near Tracy. Sacramento is forecast to hit triple digits Tuesday for the first time this year. California\u2019s capital typically hits this threshold in early June, but last year it didn\u2019t happen until the end of the month. Triple-digit temperatures will become widespread in the Central Valley Wednesday and stick around into the weekend. Conditions will also sizzle in Southern California\u2019s desert regions. Death Valley, the hottest place in the world, is likely to reach a high temperature of at least 120 degrees by Thursday. Even the brutal desert landscape doesn\u2019t typically get this hot until mid-to-late June. The Southwest will start to bake by Wednesday as temperatures in parts of southern Arizona and far southern Nevada approach 110 degrees. Phoenix will likely have hit 110 degrees for the first time this year by Thursday even though the city doesn\u2019t typically encounter these temperatures until mid-June. High temperatures are forecast to climb into the low 110s in Las Vegas, more than three weeks earlier than the city typically exceeds this threshold. The early summerlike heat will threaten daily high temperature records across a significant portion of the West this week. Phoenix; Las Vegas; Flagstaff, Arizona; Reno, Nevada; and Fresno, California, are just a handful of cities where the day\u2019s high temperature record could fall. By Friday, records could be broken in parts of Oregon, Washington, Idaho and Colorado as heat expands north and east. Fire danger will also rise while the heat is at its peak. Sizzling temperatures and low levels of humidity will dry out short-fuse fuels such as grasses and brush, making them more prone to burn. Breezy winds will develop at times, especially in California into midweek. The combination of these factors will make it easier for fires to ignite and spread. Corral Fire blazing in California\u2019s Central Valley The Corral Fire has consumed more than 14,000 acres of land in California\u2019s San Joaquin county since it ignited south of Tracy Saturday afternoon. Residents were ordered to evacuate over the weekend as the fire \u2013 initially fueled by gusty winds and dry, hot conditions \u2013 threatened communities. Firefighters gained an upper hand as winds eased Sunday and Monday and the blaze was\u00a090% contained by Tuesday morning, according to CAL Fire. Evacuation warnings were lifted Monday evening as containment increased, according to CAL Fire. Officials urged residents to remain vigilant and be ready for potential changes to the fire risk level. Two Alameda County firefighters were injured while responding to the\u00a0fire,\u00a0Cal Fire Battalion Chief Josh Silveira told CNN early Sunday morning. They had minor to moderate injuries and were transported to a local hospital for evaluation and treatment, Silveira said. A section of I-580 was closed in both directions over the weekend as the fire\u2019s thick smoke enveloped the roadway. All lanes were reopened Sunday night, according to the California Department of Transportation. The cause of the fire is under investigation, according to CAL Fire. Gusty winds up to 30 mph are possible Tuesday, which could complicate ongoing containment efforts. Temperatures will also surge well into the 90s from Tuesday through the weekend. An excessive heat warning is in effect for the region from Tuesday through Thursday.

{"id": "2024_06_04_europe_slovenia-recognizes-palestinian-state-intl-latam", "text": "Slovenia has become the latest European country to formally recognize Palestinian statehood, after the country\u2019s parliament approved the move with a majority vote on Tuesday. The decision follows those of Spain, Ireland and Norway, who formally recognized Palestinian statehood in late May. The growing momentum in Europe is likely to bolster the global Palestinian cause, but could further strain relations with Israel. Most of the world already recognizes Palestinian statehood. More than 140 out of 193 member states of the United Nations have made their recognition official. But only some nations in the 27-member European Union are among them. The vote passed with 52 votes in favor and zero against, Slovenia\u2019s national broadcaster RTV Slovenija reported. The vote passed during an extraordinary parliament session after numerous procedural hurdles, according to the outlet. \u201cToday is a historic day! The National Assembly of Slovenia has officially recognized Palestine, making Slovenia the 147th country to do so,\u201d Slovenia\u2019s Foreign Minister Tanja Fajon said in a series of posts on social media. \u201cThis recognition is an expression of our commitment to peace and justice. Slovenia is on the right side of history, contributing to the two-state solution for lasting peace,\u201d Fajon said. Israel launched its military offensive in Gaza on October 7 after the militant group Hamas, which governs Gaza, killed at least 1,200 people and abducted more than 250 others. Israeli attacks in Gaza have since killed at least\u00a036,550\u00a0Palestinians and injured another\u00a082,959\u00a0people, according to the Ministry of Health there. CNN cannot independently confirm the figures. Amid the rising toll, Israel has come under increasingly fierce criticism. Earlier this month, a panel of independent UN experts\u00a0condemned\u00a0\u201cthe continued and systematic onslaught of violence committed against Palestinians in Gaza.\u201d The agency has repeatedly called for a ceasefire\u00a0in Gaza\u00a0and the release of hostages taken\u00a0by Hamas. Slovenia\u2019s foreign minister said the country believes only a two-state solution can lead to a lasting peace in the Middle East and that her country \u201cwill tirelessly continue to work on the security of both nations, Palestinians and Israelis.\u201d The two-state solution has been the goal of the international community for decades, with many nations believing it is the only way out of the long-running conflict.

{"id": "2024_06_02_china_china-accuses-mi6-government-spies-intl-hnk", "text": "China on Monday accused Britain\u00a0of recruiting a married couple employed by\u00a0the Chinese central government to spy for its MI6 intelligence service, as the two countries trade allegations of espionage. In a statement, China\u2019s civilian spy agency, the Ministry of State Security (MSS), said it had recently cracked a \u201cmajor espionage case\u201d involving MI6, in which it uncovered two important moles \u201cplanted by the British side within our ranks.\u201d The allegation comes just weeks after British police charged three people with spying for Hong Kong\u2019s intelligence service, following charges laid in April against two other people accused of spying for China, including a former researcher for a prominent lawmaker in the ruling Conservative Party. Those charges in the United Kingdom came after China\u2019s MSS said in January it had detained the head of a foreign consultancy who had allegedly spied for MI6. Under Xi Jinping, China\u2019s most authoritarian leader in decades, the country\u2019s notoriously secretive spy agency has drastically raised its public profile and broadened its remit. From a shadowy organization without any discernable public face, the MSS has been transformed into a highly visible presence in public life. Over the last six months the MSS has made regular public declarations of dismantling foreign spying operations, claims which are impossible to verify given their nature but paint the agency in a positive light and provide regular reminders to Chinese citizens to be wary. In its latest statement Monday, the MSS detailed its allegations against the married couple. It said an alleged spy, identified by his surname Wang, was working at a position \u201cwith access to core confidential information\u201d in an unnamed central state organ. In 2015, Wang\u2019s application to study in the UK under an exchange program was \u201cswiftly approved\u201d because MI6 valued his access, according to the MSS. While studying in Britain, Wang was allegedly invited to meals and tours arranged by MI6 to understand his \u201ccharacter weaknesses and personal interests,\u201d MSS said. After finding out Wang had \u201ca strong desire for money,\u201d the British spy agency used an alumnus to lure him into a part-time consulting opportunity with high remuneration, MSS said. \u201cThe British side started with open research projects and gradually moved into core internal matters of our central state agencies, paying him a fee significantly higher than normal consulting rates. Although Wang was somewhat wary of this, he continued to provide so-called \u2018consulting\u2019 services to the British side under the lure of large sums of money,\u201d the MSS statement said. After a while, MI6 personnel approached Wang to work for the British government with promises of higher monetary rewards and security guarantees, the MSS alleged. Wang allegedly agreed to the terms and received espionage training before he was told to return to China to gather intelligence, the statement said. The MSS claimed MI6 also repeatedly urged Wang to persuade his wife \u2013 who worked at a \u201ccore\u201d government agency \u2013 to join the espionage, offering to double the money. Despite his initial hesitation, Wang and his wife, surnamed Zhou, eventually agreed, MSS alleged. The case is under further investigation, according to MSS. CNN has asked for comment from Britain\u2019s Foreign Office, which handles media enquiries for the Secret Intelligence Service, the official name for MI6. In August last year, the MSS made its social media debut: it launched an official account on WeChat, China\u2019s most popular social app, with a rallying call for \u201call members of society\u201d to join its fight against foreign infiltration. Its posts regularly rack up hundreds of thousands of views and are widely shared by state media outlets. According to the MSS, foreign spies are omnipresent and infiltrating everything \u2013 from mapping apps to weather stations. The ministry has previously posted details of what it claims are espionage activities carried out by Western spy agencies, and detailed how Chinese nationals studying or working abroad have allegedly been recruited by the CIA.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/02/china/china-accuses-mi6-government-spies-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_03_africa_burkina-faso-most-neglected-crisis-intl", "text": "Burkina Faso has been named the world\u2019s most neglected displacement crisis by the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) for the second year. In its\u00a0annual report, released Monday, the NRC said the West African country saw a record-high 707,000 new displacements in 2023, driven by escalating violence and a worsening humanitarian crisis. Nine out of the 10 most neglected crises outlined in the report were in Africa, with Cameroon, Central African Republic, Mali, and Niger holding the second to fifth positions respectively. The NRC said in a\u00a0press release Monday\u00a0its criteria for neglected displacement crises are: \u201clack of humanitarian funding, lack of media attention, and a lack of international political and diplomatic initiatives compared to the number of people in need.\u201d The NCR report said 2023 saw a record-breaking shortfall in aid budgets of around $32 billion, leaving more than half of humanitarian needs worldwide unmet. Neglect now \u2018the new normal\u2019 The report said media coverage of the displacement crisis in Burkina Faso and international political engagement with the crisis were \u201cnegligible\u201d in 2023, adding that only 37% of requested humanitarian funding had been received by the country, leaving a significant gap in aid. \u201cThe utter neglect of displaced people has become the new normal,\u201d said Jan Egeland, Secretary General of NRC. \u201cThe local political and military elites disregard the suffering they cause, and the world is neither shocked nor compelled to act by stories of desperation and record-breaking statistics. We need a global reboot of solidarity and a refocus on where needs are greatest.\u201d The report added that media coverage in Burkina Faso also declined as \u201caccess became more difficult for both journalists and humanitarian organisations.\u201d Burkina Faso is currently under military rule after a junta staged a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in July 2022. Its junta, headed by acting president Captain Ibrahim Traore, has prioritized security due to the multiple lives claimed by attacks. But in April this year, a Human Rights Watch\u00a0(HRW) report found\u00a0that more than 200 people were killed by the country\u2019s military in a campaign against civilians accused of collaborating with armed groups, alleging these could amount to war crimes. Burkina Faso said it \u201cfirmly rejects and condemns such unfounded accusations,\u201d in a\u00a0government press release. The country\u2019s\u00a0media regulatory body, the Superior Council for Communication, announced in the following days it was temporarily suspending broadcasting and access to websites of some western news organizations including the French\u00a0TV5 Monde and Le Monde, the Guardian,\u00a0as well as BBC Africa and VOA. The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) remained one of the most neglected crises for the eighth consecutive year, with around 6.9 million people displaced by the end of 2023, mainly in the eastern provinces, the report said. A lack of aid forced people to resort to negative coping mechanisms, including exchanging sexual favors for food, money, and other survival needs, the report stated. Sudan came in at number ten. Although the war which broke out in April last year has resulted in a death toll in the tens of thousands, more than eight million people internally displaced and nearly 25 million people in need of aid, the NRC remarked the crisis has been \u201cgrossly neglected.\u201d Recurrent attacks Violence-related deaths in Burkina Faso doubled in 2023, according to the NRC. The country faces recurrent attacks often blamed on \u201cterrorists.\u201d In February last year, the murder of two Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) aid workers led the organization to suspend activities in the region. By the end of the year, up to two million people were trapped in 36 blockaded towns, with over 40,000 facing catastrophic food insecurity, according to the report. A displaced mother in northern Burkina Faso, Asseta, shared her struggle with NRC researchers: \u201cWhen we have nothing to cook, I pick leaves and boil them in water,\u201d she said, as quoted in the organization\u2019s release. Egeland emphasized the growing difficulty in reaching those in need due to dangerous roads and the prohibitively expensive minimal air services. \u201cDonors and humanitarians must prioritize areas that are out-of-sight to ensure they do not become out-of-mind,\u201d he urged. The NRC says around 6.3 million people will need humanitarian assistance in 2024, with over two million remaining internally displaced. Hundreds of civilians have already been killed in attacks this year, including around 170 in three villages in March, and approximately 30 in separate mosque and church attacks in February. The NRC\u2019s report noted that many neglected crises are interconnected, with ripple effects beyond borders affecting neighboring countries and sometimes causing broader regional impacts. Competition over resources between refugees and local communities, driven by a lack of funds, can also cause tension.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/africa/burkina-faso-most-neglected-crisis-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "world"}}

There\u2019s the Art Deco curved crown of the Chrysler Building, the sweeping isosceles triangles that twist around One World Trade Center, the stepped limestone and granite rectangles of the Empire State Building and the triangular prism of the Flatiron Building. And now, a multi-billion-dollar tower featuring floor-to-ceiling glass will add another dimension to the cityscape, according to new details unveiled by New York City Mayor Eric Adams this week. Stretching up 62 stories, a planned office tower at 350 Park Avenue will provide space for more than 6,000 jobs, plus 1.8 million square feet of commercial office space, according to a press release. It will be funded by Vornado Realty Trust, Kenneth Griffin, founder and CEO of global investment firm Citadel, and building and management company Rudin. White columns will frame a new public concourse at the base of the new building on Park Avenue, complete with green space, seating and art displays, images show. Above, landscaped terraces will top each section of the glass-clad tower which will house the offices for Citadel and market making firm Citadel Securities. Adams hailed the project in the release, saying it will help \u201csupercharge our economy and expand New York City\u2019s iconic skyline,\u201d building on \u201ccontinued efforts to energize Midtown Manhattan as the world\u2019s most important business address and an economic engine for working-class New Yorkers.\u201d Architects Foster + Partners have designed the building, which will replace the existing 30-story tower currently at the site in Midtown Manhattan just a few blocks away from landmarks like the Rockefeller Center, St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral and Grand Central Station. As New York continues to deal with the economic aftershocks wrought by the Covid-19 pandemic, Adams and his administration said in their respective statements that they hoped this project would continue the city\u2019s recovery. \u201cThis investment opens a new chapter for Midtown \u2014 and closes the book on those who predicted its demise,\u201d said deputy mayor for operations Meera Joshi. \u201cMidtown\u2019s revitalization is being led by its public realm \u2014 including investments in Fifth Avenue, with the crown jewels of Central Park and Bryant Park at either end. Together, with our business improvement district and parks partners, we are reintroducing Fifth Avenue to the world and creating a vibrant live, work, play community for a new era,\u201d Joshi added. Building this new office space comes at a fraught time for the commercial real estate market as businesses struggle to entice workers back to the office after years of working from home. This has left vast tranches of office space vacant or underused, causing the value of such buildings to plummet at the same time as historically high interest rates have made it harder for real estate developers \u2014\u00a0who often take out huge loans to finance projects \u2014\u00a0to make good on their repayments. The project will begin the city\u2019s public review process early next year and the tower is expected to be completed by 2032, according to the release.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/20/style/park-avenue-skyscraper-new-york-skyline-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_04_asia_cambodia-lloyd-austin-china-intl-hnk", "text": "US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin traveled to Cambodia on Tuesday to meet with the country\u2019s prime minister and defense minister, as Washington becomes increasingly concerned that Phnom Penh\u00a0may grant China\u2019s military exclusive access to a key naval base. Austin\u2019s trip to the Cambodian capital marks his second visit to the Southeast Asian country as Secretary of Defense but is the first time a United States defense chief has traveled to Cambodia specifically to hold a bilateral meeting with his counterpart, Defense Minister Tea Seiha. The outreach reflects the US\u2019 desire to forge a better relationship with Cambodia, defense officials said, particularly as Beijing\u2019s influence over the country has only continued to grow in recent years. \u201cWe believe there is potentially an opportunity, with leadership transition in Cambodia, for us to sit down and talk about how our relationship might have a more positive and optimistic path in the future,\u201d a senior defense official told reporters, referring to Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet, who took office last year following his father Hun Sen\u2019s nearly four-decade rule. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a visit that is about significant deliverables and achievements.\u201d Austin did express the US\u2019 concerns, however, about China\u2019s funding of and presence at Cambodia\u2019s Ream Naval Base on the Gulf of Thailand, officials said. In December, China docked two warships at the base, which is in a highly strategic position close to the South China Sea. Cambodian officials have repeatedly denied the facility would be used by China as a naval base, insisting the project is in line with Cambodia\u2019s constitution, which bars foreign military bases on its territory. Chinese officials, meanwhile, have described the base as an\u00a0\u201caid project\u201d\u00a0to strengthen Cambodia\u2019s navy and called assertions otherwise \u201chype\u201d with \u201culterior motives.\u201d Beijing claims \u201cindisputable sovereignty\u201d over almost all of the 1.3-million-square-mile South China Sea, a characterization the US and many of its Indo-Pacific allies reject. Chinese vessels and aircraft have been widely documented harassing others operating in the area, including American ships and planes. The US has been particularly alarmed in recent weeks by China\u2019s attacks on Philippine vessels in the South China Sea using powerful water cannons. China also carried out large-scale military drills around the self-governing island of Taiwan last week as \u201cpunishment\u201d for its inauguration of a new president, who is openly loathed by Beijing for championing the island\u2019s sovereignty. The behavior underscores why the US is worried about the possibility that China could establish a new military outpost so close to the key waterway. \u201cThere are no doubts about where our concerns are,\u201d a Pentagon spokesperson said following Austin\u2019s meetings, when asked about Ream. \u201cMeeting face-to-face gives us a chance not only to speak clearly about our concerns, but to talk about how we might work together in the future to strengthen our relationship. And we don\u2019t ask any country to choose between partners.\u201d But as China and Cambodia have reaffirmed their military cooperation, relations between Washington and Phnom Penh have grown increasingly strained. Cambodia canceled military exercises with the US in 2017 and demolished a US-built facility at Ream in 2020, as the US has repeatedly condemned the country\u2019s poor human rights record and democratic backsliding. Last year, the Biden administration\u00a0imposed sanctions on Cambodian individuals in response to Cambodia\u2019s election, which the State Department characterized as \u201cneither free nor fair.\u201d On Tuesday, however, Austin met with former Prime Minister Hun Sen, who now serves as president of Cambodia\u2019s Senate after\u00a0transferring power to his son,\u00a0a military general. Defense officials are particularly hopeful that Austin can forge a relationship with Prime Minister Hun Manet, who, like Austin, attended the US Military Academy at West Point and is seen as more westernized than his father. In a readout following Austin\u2019s meetings, the Pentagon said\u00a0the \u201cofficials\u00a0discussed opportunities to strengthen the US-Cambodia bilateral defense relationship in support of regional peace and security, including through the resumption of military training exchanges on disaster assistance and United Nations Peacekeeping, training and exchanges on de-mining and unexploded ordnance clearance, and Cambodia\u2019s access to US PME [professional military education] programs. They also welcomed continued discussions about these issues between their respective defense establishments.\u201d Austin\u2019s visit to Phnom Penh capped a five-day trip to Asia, where he attended the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore and warned of China\u2019s \u201ccoercive\u201d activities in the region while working to deepen the US\u2019 relationships with key Asian leaders. In a meeting with China\u2019s Defense Minister Dong Jun last week, their first face-to-face, Austin said the US wants to keep military-to-military channels open with the Chinese to avoid misunderstandings and escalation. In a combative speech later on, Dong appeared to agree with that, but he also slammed \u201cexternal interfering forces\u201d for selling arms and having \u201cillegal official contacts\u201d with Taiwan \u2014 a thinly veiled reference to the US, which maintains close yet unofficial ties with the island democracy. In the same remarks, however, Dong said Beijing \u201cnever acts from the so-called position of strength.\u201d A senior US official told CNN that the speech was \u201cat complete odds with the reality\u201d of\u00a0China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army\u2019s\u00a0\u201ccoercive activity across the region.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/asia/cambodia-lloyd-austin-china-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "world"}}

With Jakarta, the current capital of 10 million, overcrowded and plagued by massive traffic jams as well as chronic flooding and sinking land, Indonesia is building a new capital, called Nusantara, in the jungles of East Kalimantan on Borneo \u2013 an island shared with Malaysia. \u201cThe President has appointed the public works and housing minister and deputy agrarian minister as the acting head and deputy head,\u201d State Secretariat Minister Pratikno said on Monday. He said the appointments would speed up construction and the resignations had long been discussed. In his official Instagram account, Indonesia\u2019s President Joko Widodo on Monday ensured the public that the project\u2019s development would continue. \u201cThe development of new capital will be continued in line with the shared vision that has been established,\u201d he said. Bambang Susantono, a former official at the Asian Development Bank who was heading the project and his deputy Dhony Rahajoe, an architect and former real estate developer, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Its consistent wind makes it a hotspot for kitesurfing enthusiasts, but a new port, currently halfway through construction, could turn the area into a gateway for trade. The $1.2 billion megaproject is expected to complete in 2028. Spanning 1,650 hectares, the complex will include a trade port with an oil terminal, a fishing port and a shipyard. There will be a bridge linking the port to the land and a 7-kilometer road that connects the port with a national highway that runs along the coast as far north as Tangier and as far south as the border with Mauritania. \u201cWe\u2019re constructing an ecosystem,\u201d Nisrine Iouzzi, the director of construction for the Dakhla Atlantic Port, tells CNN. Once operational, she expects the port to handle 35 million tons of goods a year. This will not only boost Morocco\u2019s economy, she says, but it could help the country become a maritime hub for worldwide trade, connecting regions such as West Africa, the Middle East, Europe, North America, the Canary Islands and even South America. \u201cThe geographic location is key (to) the success of the port,\u201d she says, adding that the project has attracted significant foreign investment, including from the United Arab Emirates. Gateway to Africa The project is part of Morocco\u2019s national port strategy, which aims to modernize and strengthen port infrastructure by 2030, in order to enhance its role in global supply chains. Seaports such as Casablanca, Tanger-Med and Agadir have already been or are being upgraded, but because of its location, the Dakhla port is seen as particularly significant in opening up\u00a0other parts of the African continent for the world to trade with. \u201cWe strongly believe that with this infrastructure \u2013 port infrastructure, road infrastructure, renewable energy \u2013 we will be very attractive for investors that aim to get to one of the fastest growing markets, which is the West African market,\u201d says Mounir Houari, general manager of Dakhla\u2019s Regional Investment Center. With the implementation of Africa\u2019s continental free trade agreement, which aims to create a single market for goods and services, the port could encourage the processing of raw materials within the continent. \u201cLess than 5% of African natural resources are processed in Africa because there is no industrial infrastructure and exporting infrastructure,\u201d says Houari. The Dakhla port \u201cwill encourage many Africans to start processing natural resources in Africa, allowing African countries to create more jobs to improve their skills and know-how and strengthen their own industries.\u201d The Sahel region, especially landlocked countries such as Mali, Chad, Niger and Burkina Faso, are expected to benefit. Houari explains that Morocco has granted the region access to its road and port infrastructure, providing \u201ca door to the Atlantic maritime trade.\u201d Turloch Mooney, head of port intelligence and analytics at research firm S&P Global Market Intelligence, says the development could be beneficial to the region. \u201cIt is very positive to see modern port and trade infrastructure being developed in the Western Sahara where there is potential to support a large hinterland in West Africa and the Sahel,\u201d he says. \u201cQuality port infrastructure and efficient port operations is part of the package of assurance for foreign direct investment and has been a key factor in the successful growth strategies of many developing countries.\u201d But Western Sahara and the Sahel region has a long history of unrest. \u201cLocal disputes can make developing port infrastructure and reliable logistics much more challenging,\u201d says Mooney.

That morning \u2013 on 5 December \u2013 the shells found me,\u201d the 43-year-old bearded soldier, who now uses a wheelchair, told CNN in Berlin, as he pointed\u00a0to where his legs should be. Instead, there are two stumps: One of his legs is amputated just below the knee joint, the other is amputated above the knee. Fellow Ukrainian soldier Vitaliy Sayko-Kazakov, 42, served in the 19th Separate Rifle Battalion in Chervonopopivka, on the front line where Ukraine\u2019s Luhansk and Donetsk regions meet. His left leg was torn off during a battle with Russian forces on July 1 last year. \u201cI immediately put a tourniquet on myself and luckily remained conscious. On adrenaline, I guess, I saved myself,\u201d he said. His right leg sustained serious injuries with an open fracture and eventually had to be amputated in Lviv, he told CNN earlier this month in Berlin. For three months he was confined to his hospital bed. Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine has killed tens of thousands and left even more with lost limbs and other life-altering injuries since the full-scale invasion began in February 2022. German officials estimate there are between 30,000 and 50,000 Ukrainian amputees as a result of the conflict. Obtaining adequate prosthetic limbs and care is tough inside Ukraine. Now a German non-governmental organization is working to bring wounded Ukrainian soldiers to Berlin so they can be fitted with custom-made artificial limbs and given treatment that will allow them to lead as normal a life as possible. Kushnirov and Sayko-Kazakov are among the first of 60 severely wounded Ukrainian soldiers who will receive treatment in Germany, thanks to the Berlin-based NGO \u201cLife Bridge Ukraine.\u201d They hope to start what they see as a new life soon. \u201cMy doctor called and said there was an opportunity to go abroad for me to receive prosthetics. So, I said OK,\u201d Vitaliy said. \u201cOnce there were hundreds of us, now there are thousands of people like me.\u201d Limbs amputated quickly to save lives Marko G\u00e4nsl, from German health care company Seeger,\u00a0is among five orthopedic technicians in Berlin who build custom-made prostheses for the soldiers. When CNN visited the wounded soldiers in their accommodation center for the first time, G\u00e4nsl was assessing the new patients. Bending over Kushnirov\u2019s leg stumps, he softly felt along them. \u201cAre you in pain?\u201d he asked.\u00a0Kushnirov shook his head as a translator relayed the question. \u201cLet me know if anything hurts,\u201d G\u00e4nsl said, taking out a tape to measure the stumps. He and other orthopedic technicians assessed the condition of Kushnirov\u2019s limbs. Battlefield conditions in Ukraine mean limbs must often be amputated quickly to save soldiers\u2019 lives. \u201cThe severity of the amputations often leave the survivors with stumps that won\u2019t allow for the fitting of regular-sized prosthetics,\u201d said G\u00e4nsl. \u201cAnd of course we are dealing here with completely different requirements (than what orthopedic technicians are used to in Germany).\u201d It will be relatively easy to provide a prosthesis for Kushnirov\u2019s right leg, G\u00e4nsl\u00a0said. However, his left leg will be more difficult to treat because it was amputated above the knee. G\u00e4nsl moved on to inspect the next patient: 27-year-old Valerii Omelchenko, who was drafted into the war three months after Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. \u201cI was on duty defending my country on November 23 last year when a Russian drone flew over me and a grenade exploded right in front of me,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cI jumped away and pulled my legs into my chest to protect myself from the explosion which I knew was coming. But look at my legs, they are injured badly.\u201d Sitting in a wheelchair with his left leg amputated and the other one badly bruised and shattered, Omelchenko added: \u201cBut at least I am still alive.\u201d Keen to save his damaged leg, doctors in Germany kept it in a metal frame, or external fixator, at first while it healed. That has just been removed and he will be fitted with a prosthesis on the other leg soon. A bridge between two capitals Janine von Wolfersdorff, a Berlin-based financial expert who became involved in humanitarian aid work in Ukraine after Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion, is the initiator of Life Bridge Ukraine, a project\u00a0which is being run in partnership between the German and Ukrainian capitals. Under its auspices, experts in workshops in Berlin will make new limbs and teach the 60 patients chosen for treatment how to walk and move again. Von Wolfersdorff traveled\u00a0to Ukraine herself with a medical team to assess some of the most seriously injured soldiers. \u201cIt\u2019s a challenge to find the right patients in Ukraine. There are so many complex cases. At the same time, there are too few orthopedic technicians in Ukraine to provide all war victims with fast, adequate and good care,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cWe want to give Ukrainian war-wounded soldiers a new life\u00a0\u2013\u00a0and simultaneously want to train six Ukrainians for three months here in Berlin, who will learn to build very good quality prosthetics so that they can do it themselves in Kyiv.\u201d Von Wolfersdorff is collaborating closely with Kyiv\u2019s Mayor Vitali Klitschko and Berlin\u2019s Governing Mayor Kai Wegner on the project, hoping that a prosthetics center will be opened in Kyiv later this year. Ultimately,\u00a0her group wants to open further prosthetics centres in other Ukrainian cities as well. \u201cThe trainees learn here first-hand when a stump may need another amputation, another surgery, when a scar needs to be attended to again, and other issues that arise during this very complex process,\u201d Von Wolfersdorff\u00a0said. CNN met with Ukrainian trainee Volodymyr Havrylov in the Seeger workshop. \u201cIt takes time to train to do it correctly and get every detail right,\u201d he said. In the past few weeks, he has learnt that \u201csurgeons need to make a good stump. The better the stump is, the easier for us to make a stump receiver.\u201d Each patient requires a different treatment, Havrylov said, explaining that \u201csometimes the limb is too short, sometimes it is long\u00a0\u2013\u00a0sometimes there is not enough space for the fitting. Sometimes patients still have pain somewhere.\u201d Oftentimes there are other medical conditions that could influence the fitting of prosthetic limbs. Havrylov said he wants to learn \u201cas much as possible from the Germans and maybe even get better at it so that we can open our center in Kyiv and help there. Unfortunately, there will be more people with injuries. We need good workshops to provide our Ukrainians with a good life. We need to bring them back into society.\u201d Life Bridge Ukraine has collected around $600,000 in donations for the project, including for the care of the soldiers in Berlin. \u201cIt is a long process of recuperation,\u201d Von Wolfersdorff said. \u201cWe seek a holistic treatment approach:\u00a0In addition to a lot of physiotherapy, patients are offered psychological help, as well as nutritional advice, to reintegrate themselves into as\u00a0normal as possible\u00a0a\u00a0life.\u201d \u2018Completely new way of learning to walk\u2019 A few weeks later, CNN joined Kushnirov and Sayko-Kazakov for their first fittings in Seeger\u2019s Berlin workshop. Vitaliy looked at his new artificial limbs and smiled. \u201cThese are my two legs,\u201d he said, pointing at his new prosthetic limbs. \u201cOne and two. We are going to fit them today.\u201d With the help of the medical and orthopedic technician teams Sayko-Kazakov took his first steps\u00a0using them.\u00a0\u201cThese are cool feet. Really fine work.\u201d For Kushnirov, the initial fitting was trickier because of the artificial knee joint on one limb. \u201cUnfortunately walking will be more difficult for him,\u201d G\u00e4nsl explained. \u201cIt is a completely new way of learning how to walk.\u201d Kushnirov knows his rehabilitation process will take time, but he is determined to keep trying. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame I am losing so much time getting rehabilitated and I know it will still take me a lot of time. But of course, my life will improve,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s hard to say what life will be like after my prosthetics fittings. I know it will be different.\u201d Sayko-Kazakov, Kushnirov and the other soldiers with new artificial limbs will receive a lot of training on how to move again in the coming weeks in Berlin. Any final adjustments that are needed will be made before they receive their permanent prosthetic fittings and leave to be cared for back home in Ukraine. \u201cIt is a lot of fun working together with our highly motivated patients and Ukrainian trainees, we see so much progress,\u201d G\u00e4nsl said. However, there will be challenges ahead for these soldiers even with their final artificial limbs. \u201cProsthetic fittings need to be adjusted again and again. It is a lifelong process,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter all, bodies change. Just as we occasionally put on weight over Christmas or lose weight when exercising, a stump does not grow with you.\u201d Both Sayko-Kazakov and Kushnirov are determined to return to Ukraine soon, walking comfortably with their new artificial limbs. They say they\ufeff are ready to support their units back home as they fight to fend off Russian forces. \u201cThe war is not yet over. Our work is not yet finished,\u201d Sayko-Kazakov said. \u201cI\u00a0often think of the guys who worked with me at the front line. So many lost their lives. So many I carried out on my shoulders. It hurts. When we go back, we can be useful on the home front, for example assembling drones.\u201d Kushnirov acknowledges his limitations\ufeff. \u201cI know I won\u2019t be able to walk again just like others do. I won\u2019t be able to fight at the front line anymore,\u201d he said, \u201cbut there are a lot of other things I can do: I could operate a drone or take care of repair and maintenance works. Wherever I can help, I will do so. I will continue to fight for Ukraine.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/europe/ukraine-soldiers-germany-prosthetic-limbs-intl-cmd/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_03_style_becoming-karl-lagerfeld-show", "text": "\u201cI like anonymity,\u201d designer Karl Lagerfeld (played by Daniel Br\u00fchl) tells Jacques de Bascher (actor Th\u00e9odore Pellerin) in the first episode of \u201cBecoming Karl Lagerfeld,\u201d a new six-part series based on Rapha\u00eblle Bacqu\u00e9\u2019s novel \u201cKaiser Karl.\u201d De Bascher \u2014 a fledgling writer and Lagerfeld\u2019s eventual love interest \u2014 has accompanied him to the fashion show of his friend and rival Yves Saint Laurent (played by Arnaud Valois). \u201cOf course,\u201d de Bacher deadpans. \u201cYou dress like the Sun King to go unnoticed.\u201d The Sun King was the nickname of King Louis XIV, who ruled over 17th and 18th century France in a procession of exaggerated sleeves, flowing ruffles and intricately patterned fabric. While Lagerfeld leaves off the tumbling dark wig, de Bacher\u2019s comparison is not unfounded. His wardrobe \u2014 which may occasionally inspire vague comparisons to Caesar Flickerman (Stanley Tucci\u2019s character in \u201cThe Hunger Games\u201d) \u2014 is a parade of flared trousers and elaborate tie pins; cravats matched to pocket squares, heeled boots, and a selection of ties that would put Chuck Bass (Ed Westwick in \u201cGossip Girl\u201d) to shame. It is a rich palette of jewel and earth tones; petrol blues and pinstripes. And while his signature starched collar and fingerless gloves are yet to make an appearance, his looks are already topped off with another of his soon-to-be trademarks: a pair of dark aviator sunglasses. Opening in 1972, \u201cBecoming Karl Lagerfeld\u201d \u2014 which premieres on Hulu June 7 \u2014 follows its namesake\u2019s love life and career throughout the decade and into the spring of 1981, halting just before he began working with Chanel in 1983. Having joined ready-to-wear champion Chlo\u00e9 in 1966, Lagerfeld became the brand\u2019s lone designer in 1974. The show follows his drawn-out power struggle with Chlo\u00e9\u2019s founder Gaby Aghion (played by Agn\u00e8s Jaoui), who first discovered his talents but whose stubbornness prevents him from truly showing off his artistic, haute couture genius. It is a noticeable choice by the series creators to portray Lagerfeld so sympathetically. In 2023, when the Metropolitan Museum of Art hosted its gala and corresponding exhibition in Lagerfeld\u2019s honor, critics were quick to point out the numerous controversial statements the designer had made about weight, women, immigrants, victims of sexual assault and gay marriage. In \u201cBecoming Karl Lagerfeld\u201d he is brooding, combative and ambitious, sure \u2014 but we are equally encouraged to root for him. It is instead Saint Laurent who suffers the worst PR: in the love triangle that takes over the plot he is every inch the tortured artist, fawning desperately and pathetically over de Bascher; Lagerfeld, on the other hand, plays the aloof scorned lover. A man\u2019s world? One of the show\u2019s standout lines does point to Lagerfeld\u2019s sexist tendencies. \u201cFashion has nothing to do with women, or there wouldn\u2019t be so many gays in the business,\u201d he tells de Bascher at the same YSL show in the first episode. \u201cIt\u2019s a way of embodying the zeitgeist, of reflecting society\u2019s true nature.\u201d He is then roundly contradicted by Marlene Dietrich (played by Sunnyi Melles) who co-opts his own metaphor in the following episode to tell him, flatly, that \u201ca fashion designer is just a mirror for the woman he\u2019s dressing\u2026 You only exist if the reflection in the mirror pleases me.\u201d These might not be direct quotes from the real life Lagerfeld or Dietrich, but they do show the ego underlying Lagerfeld\u2019s character \u2013 and also pose the interesting question of how gender and power operate within the fashion industry. Despite Dietrich\u2019s protestations, the creators of \u201cBecoming Karl Lagerfeld\u201d seem to side with their muse. Nearly all the female characters across the series appear as emotional support or pretty backdrops \u2014 canvases from which Lagerfeld and Saint Laurent may suspend their art. Parisian fashion in the 1970s was, \u201cBecoming Karl Lagerfeld\u201d suggests, a scene broadly gatekept by a handful of squabbling men. The history of high fashion isn\u2019t that simple, though. Haute couture \u2014 where Lagerfeld was so eager to make his name \u2014 did not exist until 1858, and its arrival upset the existing trend of having female dressmakers. \u201cThe notion of haute (couture) and the client didn\u2019t exist until (Charles Frederick) Worth,\u201d Claire Wilcox, senior curator of fashion at London\u2019s Victoria and Albert Museum, told CNN over the phone. \u201cIt was an important break in fashion history.\u201d Worth opened the very first house, earning the status of haute couture\u2019s \u201cfather\u201d. In a 2014 essay, historian Abigail Joseph wrote that before Worth, women were largely responsible for dressing other women, having first been given the right to enter the industry by \u2014 coincidentally \u2014 Louis XIV in 1675. By the time Worth opened his doors, women designers were so normalized that the idea of a male dressmaker raised eyebrows: Joseph described the accusations of effeminacy and \u201cinappropriate masculinity\u201d leveled at Worth; in Pierre Larousse\u2019s famed encyclopedia of the 19th century, he protested that fashion needed \u201cfairy-like fingers, not the build of an athlete, to be practiced properly and above all decently.\u201d By 1889, however, the tide had turned again: an edition of the \u201cPeterborough Express\u201d declared the name Worth \u201csynonymous with the center of the fashionable world\u201d. The \u201cLeitrim Advertiser,\u201d six years later, heralded his designs as \u201cdestined to revolutionize the world of feminine dress.\u201d The 20th century then saw a boom in couture houses modeled on Worth\u2019s example. While the likes of Chanel and Schiaparelli also made names for themselves, many of the biggest names were men, including Dior and Balmain in the 1940s and Givenchy in 1952. Neither this context nor women\u2019s relation to fashion is given much attention after Dietrich\u2019s diatribe, as the focus shifts increasingly to Lagerfeld and de Bascher\u2019s tumultuous relationship. \u201cBecoming Karl Lagerfeld\u201d is, stylistically, a luxurious tribute to \u201870s flair: gorgeous to look at and offering an aggressively humanized look at some of fashion\u2019s biggest names. But pulling harder at the thread of fashion\u2019s gendered power dynamics might have added a welcomed complexity.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/style/becoming-karl-lagerfeld-show/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "world"}}
