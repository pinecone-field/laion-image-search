{"id": "2024_06_08_middleeast_four-israeli-hostages-freed-gaza-intl", "text": "The Israeli military rescued four hostages in a special operation in the Nuseirat refugee camp, central Gaza, that Gazan authorities said killed 236 people and injured more than 400 others. Noa Argamani, Almog Meir Jan, Andrey Kozlov, and Shlomi Ziv, were rescued by the Israeli military, intelligence and special forces from two separate locations in Nuseirat, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Saturday. All four were kidnapped from the Nova music festival on October 7. \u201cThey are in good medical condition and have been transferred to the \u2018Sheba\u2019 Tel-HaShomer Medical Center for further medical examinations,\u201d the IDF added. An\u00a0Israeli\u00a0policeman from a special\u00a0counter-terrorism\u00a0unit was killed in Saturday\u2019s rescue operation, according to\u00a0Israeli\u00a0police. News of the rescue came soon after Israel\u2019s military said it was operating in Nuseirat and other areas of central Gaza, where heavy shelling and artillery fire was reported. At least 236 people have been killed as a result of the rescue operation and more than 400 injured, hospital officials in Gaza said Saturday. The killed and wounded were taken to two hospitals in Gaza, Al-Awda Hospital in Nuseirat and Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir Al-Balah. Al-Awda Hospital director Dr Marwan Abu Nasser told CNN that 142 bodies had been counted at the medical facility by late Saturday, while Al-Aqsa Hospital in Deir al-Balah said 94 bodies had been counted. CNN has no way of verifying casualty numbers reported by Palestinian officials in Gaza. Medical records in the war-torn enclave do not differentiate between civilians and militants killed. An Israeli military spokesperson put the number of casualties from the operation at \u201cunder 100,\u201d and had no information on how many of those were civilians. Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said Israeli forces had to enter civilian areas to reach hostages as this was where Hamas had embedded itself. He said the hostages had been locked in two separate apartments in civilian multi-story buildings about 200 meters (650 feet) apart, with Argamani held in a different building to the three males. He said the IDF had received intelligence on their location beforehand, noting that hostages in Gaza were frequently moved around and Argamani had previously been held elsewhere. Similar raids had been called off at the last minute \u201cmore than three or four times\u201d due to unfavorable conditions, he added. The first phase of Saturday\u2019s operation saw the IDF target militant infrastructure with pre-planned strikes, Hagari said. For the rescue, the IDF had opted for a daytime operation because of the element of surprise, he added, and it had prepared by building models of the apartments the hostages were held in. Hagari said that the IDF had come under intense fire, especially after withdrawing from the apartments, but did not provide evidence for his claims. Saturday was an \u201cemotional and happy day for the state of Israel and the IDF,\u201d Hagari said, though he cautioned that most of the remaining hostages were not being held in conditions that would allow for similar operations. Following Saturday\u2019s announcement, the total number of hostages still held in the Gaza Strip from October 7 is now 116, of which at least 41 are dead. \u2018It is hell on earth\u2019 On the ground in Gaza, locals described scenes of carnage following the strikes that led up to the rescue. Nidal Abdo, was shopping in Nuseirat on Saturday when he described a \u201ccrazy bombardment\u201d hitting. \u201c[It was] something we never witnessed before, maybe 150 rockets fell in less than 10 minutes, while we were running away more fell on the market,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are children torn apart and scattered in the streets, they wiped out Nuseirat, it is hell on earth,\u201d he said. Another local, Abu Abdallah, said the strike hit while people were sleeping, adding: \u201cDogs were eating people\u2019s remains. We pulled out six martyrs, all torn up children and women, we risked our lives to get them to the hospital.\u201d Footage from Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital shows trucks and ambulances transferring injured people and bodies to the hospital. Inside the hospital, people can be seen waiting on the  floor. Graphic video shows many Palestinians, including children, injured with blood on their faces and clothes. Footage from the hospital also shows people screaming and crying, huddled over bodies covered in blankets. Hamas described the operation as a \u201cbrutal crime, devoid of the values of civilization and humanity,\u201d saying the Israeli military \u201ccommitted a horrific massacre against innocent civilians.\u201d Hamas said the rescue would not change Israel\u2019s \u201cstrategic failure in the Gaza Strip,\u201d as the group still holds a large number of other hostages after eight months of fighting. The group\u2019s leader Ismail Haniyeh said, \u201cOur people will not surrender, and the resistance will continue to defend our rights in the face of this criminal enemy.\u201d Abu Obaida, the spokesman for the group\u2019s armed wing, the Al-Qassam Brigades, also claimed some hostages had been killed during the rescue mission, but provided no proof and did not elaborate on the identities of who had purportedly died. In a post on Telegram, he said the rescue raid \u201cposed a great danger\u201d to the remaining hostages and \u201cwill have a devastating impact on their conditions and lives.\u201d Asked about the claim, the Israel Defense Forces said, \u201cHamas is a terrorist organization that uses psychological terrorism in order to achieve its goals, accordingly its statements should be taken with limited credibility.\u201d Hostage rescues are rare: this is only the third such successful operation. IDF Corporal Ori Megidish was rescued in October last year from the northern Gaza Strip. In another operation on February 12 this year, Fernando Marman and Louis Har were rescued from southern Rafah. A symbol of October 7 One of the rescued group, 25-year-old Noa Argamani, became one of the symbols of the October 7 attacks, after video emerged of her shouting and pleading from the seat of a motorbike as a group of Hamas fighters drives away with her in tow. In the video, Argamani\u2019s boyfriend, fellow Israeli citizen Avinatan Or, is also led away by Hamas fighters. Noa\u2019s mother Liora Argamani is a Chinese citizen who has been grappling with late stage brain cancer. In a video released last November, she made a desperate plea to be able to see her daughter one more time. \u201cI don\u2019t know how long I have left. I wish for the chance to see my Noa at home,\u201d her mother said, calling on US President Joe Biden to push for her daughter\u2019s release. A spokesperson for Ichilov Hospital in Tel Aviv confirmed on Saturday that Argamani had been transferred there so that she could be treated alongside her mother. Argamani\u2019s family had previously received signs that she was still alive. She appeared in a series of Hamas propaganda videos released in January this year. Video showed Argamani embracing her father after her release. She also held a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who told her \u201cwe didn\u2019t give up on you for a moment.\u201d Of the others freed: \u2013 Almog Meir Jan, 22, is from the small city of Or Yehuda, outside Tel Aviv. He was due to start a new job at a technology company on October 8. \u2013 Shlomi Ziv, 41, was working as a security guard at the Nova festival when he was kidnapped on October 7. Ziv had been living in the local moshav or agricultural settlement for 17 years with his wife Miren. \u2013 Andrey Kozlov, 27, is a Russian citizen who move to Israel a year ago. He was also working as a security guard at the Nova festival. \u2018We can\u2019t forget\u2019 the others Relatives of the rescued hostages said they felt happy and blessed to be reunited with their loved ones but also called on the Israeli government to bring back the remaining captives. \u201cI couldn\u2019t stop hugging him,\u201d Orit Meir, mother of Almog Meir Jan, told a news conference Saturday. \u201cTomorrow is my birthday so I got my present.\u201d Meir thanked the Israeli military and government for the rescue, but also urged the government to secure the release of the dozens of captives that remained in Gaza. \u201cWe want a deal now. We want them to come back home as soon as possible,\u201d she said. Jennifer Master, the girlfriend of Andrey Kozlov, echoed those sentiments, saying, \u201cThank you for saving our loved ones. And we wish that all the loved ones will come back home safe and sound and there will be a deal soon.\u201d Yaakov Argamani, father of Noa Argamani, added: \u201cWe can\u2019t forget there are 120 hostages. We must do everything, but everything, as soon as possible to bring them home, so that their families can embrace them in happiness.\u201d Rozi Ziv, mother of Shlomi Ziv, said, \u201cMy dream came true. I wish for the other hostages that their dreams will come true, too.\u201d Meanwhile, following news of the rescue, thousands of demonstrators gathered across Israel, calling on the government to secure a deal to free the remaining hostages. In Tel Aviv, demonstrators gathered at a plaza informally known as Hostages Square, many  holding up pictures of the hostages with signs that read, \u201cBring them home now.\u201d Earlier, the crowd cheered the Israeli military for its rescue operation. Many are calling for new elections, calling for Netanyahu\u2019s government to step down.

{"id": "2024_06_06_americas_cuba-russian-ships-submarine-visit-intl-latam", "text": "A group of Russian naval ships, including a nuclear-powered submarine, will visit Cuba next week as part of \u201chistorically friendly relations,\u201d Cuba\u2019s government said Thursday. The Russian \u201cfrigate Gorshkov, the nuclear-powered submarine Kazan, the fleet oil tanker Pashin, and the rescue tug Nikolai Chiker\u201d will visit the port of Havana between June 12 and 17, according to the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces in a statement published by the Foreign Ministry. Cuba says none of the ships carry nuclear weapons and insists their stopover does not represent a threat to the region. \u201cVisits by naval units from other countries are a historical practice of the revolutionary government with nations that maintain relations of friendship and collaboration,\u201d the statement added. Moscow has not confirmed the information provided by Cuba. CNN has reached out to the Russian government for comment. It\u2019s not the first time Russian Navy ships have been sent to Cuba, a key ally to the former Soviet Union during the Cold War that briefly hosted nuclear missiles at Moscow\u2019s behest during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. Last July, the Russian Navy\u2019s training class ship Perekop sailed into Havana for a four-day visit. The latest visit appears to be the largest of its kind in years. Cuba is increasingly reliant on Russian oil and aid as the communist-run country weathers its worst economic crisis in decades. Cuba\u2019s announcement comes days after US President Joe Biden gave Ukraine permission to carry out limited strikes inside Russian territory with American munitions. In response, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Western countries \u201csupplying weapons to a conflict zone is always a bad thing.\u201d \u201cIn the end, if we see that these countries become involved in a war against us, what they are doing makes them directly involved in a war against the Russian Federation, we reserve the right to act the same way,\u201d Putin said on Wednesday. Putin added that as a response, \u201cwe will improve our air defense systems to destroy the missiles.\u201d He also asked why Russia would \u201cnot have the right to supply our weapons of the same class to those regions of the world where there will be strikes on the sensitive facilities of those countries that are doing this against Russia?\u201d \u2018No direct threat\u2019 Russia\u2019s military is expected to increase its naval and air activity near the United States this summer as part of routine maneuvers in the lead up to a global naval exercise in the fall, according to the US State Department and the Pentagon. \u201cRussia is likely to send combat naval vessels to the Caribbean, with potential port calls in Cuba and possibly Venezuela,\u201d Pentagon spokesperson Maj. Charlie Dietz said on Thursday. \u201cAircraft deployments or flights in the region are also anticipated. These deployments are part of Russia\u2019s routine naval operations and pose no direct threat to the United States.\u201d Alongside Russian ships this summer will also be one of the Russian Navy\u2019s Severodvinsk II-class submarines, Dietz said. The port call for that submarine was approved \u201cat least in part due to Havana\u2019s displeasure\u201d over the visit of a US nuclear submarine to the US\u2019 Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba last year, he said. Cuba has hosted Russian ships every year between 2013 and 2020, Dietz said, adding that the exercises \u201cimpose a significant cost on the Russian Navy, which faces challenges in maintaining readiness and conducting deployments with an aging fleet.\u201d \u201cGiven Russia\u2019s long history of Cuban port calls, these are considered routine naval visits, especially in the context of increased US support to Ukraine and NATO exercises,\u201d Dietz said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/americas/cuba-russian-ships-submarine-visit-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_06_africa_sudanese-government-accuses-militia-massacre-intl", "text": "At least 150 people were killed and 200 injured in an attack by rebel forces in Sudan, local officials and witnesses said, in the latest atrocity in the year-long war that has displaced more than 7 million people. Eyewitnesses told CNN Thursday how fighters from Sudan\u2019s paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) descended upon Wad al-Nour village in the central Al-Jazira state on Wednesday. They described scenes of terror and carnage as over 40 armed vehicles stormed the village, unleashing heavy weaponry on its inhabitants, killing and wounding mostly civilians, among them children and women. Fighting is still ongoing just a few kilometers away, with terrified villagers fearful of further escalations, the witness said. Another eyewitness reported the ongoing grim task of counting the dead and injured. \u201cSo far, we\u2019ve buried more than 120 people in a mass grave in the middle of the village,\u201d he said. CNN cannot independently verify the exact number of casualties. Footage shared on social media Wednesday, and geolocated by CNN, shows a large crowd in Wad Al-Noura village surrounding dozens of dead bodies, shrouded in white, as preparations were being made for their burial. Another video allegedly shows the RSF militia firing heavy and medium weapons towards the village. Both the Sudanese army and the RSF have faced damning accusations of civilian massacres since the civil war broke out in April 2023. The RSF acknowledged the attack in a statement Wednesday and said it was a pre-emptive attack on\u00a0Sudan\u2019s Armed Forces (SAF),\u00a0camps in Wad Al-Noura in response to a planned attack by the army.\u00a0They did not acknowledge the civilian deaths reported. According to the RSF, eight of its fighters were killed, others injured, and they seized vehicles, weapons, and military equipment during the operation. However, eyewitnesses told CNN that there is no military presence in the village, adding that the Sudanese army operates a military base about 30 km (19 miles) southwest of Wad Al-Noura, which is being cited as a possible reason for the attack. CNN has contacted both RSF and the Sudanese Army for comment. The leader of the SAF vowed to retaliate after arriving in a city near the attack where he visited survivors, according to state news agency SUNA. \u201cThe response to the militia\u2019s crimes against the martyrs of [Wad al-Nour] will be severe and harsh,\u201d warned Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, SAF Commander-in-Chief and President of the Sudanese Transitional Sovereignty Council. A strategic target Wad al-Nour village lies about 160 kilometers south of Sudanese capital Khartoum and is now the latest epicenter of violence in a country ravaged by internal conflict. The village has long been a strategic target for the RSF, given its close location to Al-Manaqil, where the Sudanese army maintains its only presence in Al-Jazira state. This was not the first attempt by the RSF to control Wad al-Noura, as they have tried several times to take the village. Thousands have perished since fighting erupted between forces loyal to two rival generals \u2013 army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, leader of the SAF, and General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, head of the RSF. Since the conflict started, both the Sudanese army and the RSF have faced damning accusations of civilian massacres. The RSF has specifically targeted villages in Al-Jazira, Sudan\u2019s agricultural heartland, to swell its ranks through forced conscription and using hunger as a weapon, eyewitnesses have said. In March, eyewitnesses told CNN\u00a0that more than 700 people, including dozens of children, were forcibly recruited from the state by the militia group after being ordered to \u201cenlist or die.\u201d The RSF denied this claim. International outcry and humanitarian crisis The Sudanese Transitional Sovereignty Council condemned the RSF\u2019s actions, describing them as part of a systematic campaign of violence against civilians. \u201cThis heinous crime is added to the series of crimes committed by this rebel militia in many states of Sudan. These are criminal acts that reflect the systematic behavior of these militias in targeting civilians, plundering their property, and forcibly displacing them from their areas,\u201d the Council stated. A UN representative on Thursday expressed deep concern over the reported violence and called for a thorough investigation and accountability for those responsible. \u201cEven by the tragic standards of Sudan\u2019s conflict, the images emerging from Wad Al-Noura are heart-breaking. Wars have rules that need to be respected, no matter what,\u201d UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Sudan Clementine Nkweta-Salami said. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) has warned that \u201cthe number of people displaced by conflict inside Sudan could top 10 million in the coming days.\u201d \u201cThe world\u2019s worst internal displacement crisis continues to escalate, with looming famine and disease adding to the havoc wrought by conflict,\u201d IOM said in a statement on Thursday. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs noted that over 8.8 million people have fled their homes, and 24.8 million urgently need assistance. Last week at the UN Security Council, Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide Alice Wairimu Nderitu warned, \u201cThe situation today bears all the marks of risk of genocide, with strong allegations that this crime has already been committed.\u201d CNN\u2019s Avery Schmitz contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/africa/sudanese-government-accuses-militia-massacre-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_04_19_style_graham-sutherland-winston-churchill-portrait", "text": "\u201cThat is not a painting, it\u2019s a humiliation!\u201d Winston Churchill (played by John Lithgow) angrily tells the renowned painter Graham Sutherland (actor Stephen Dillane) in the first season of \u201cThe Crown,\u201d Netflix\u2019s six-series dramatization about the English monarchy. Churchill is talking about his own portrait, commissioned to celebrate his 80th birthday, as it is unveiled in London\u2019s Westminster Hall in November 1954. Churchill goes on to describe his appearance in the painting as \u201ca broken, sagging, pitiful creature,\u201d Sutherland as \u201ca Judas wielding his murderous brush,\u201d and concludes the whole work is \u201ca betrayal of friendship, and an unpatriotic, treacherous, cowardly assault by the individualistic left!\u201d The episode ends with Churchill\u2019s wife Clementine (played by Harriet Walter) watching it burn on a bonfire outside their home. Evidently, he was not a fan. While \u201cThe Crown\u201d is not a documentary, it is true that the 80th birthday portrait \u2014described by Churchill as \u201cfilthy and malignant\u201d in a letter to his personal doctor \u2014 was burned. \u201cI think he was quite vain about his image,\u201d Andre Zlattinger, Deputy Chairman UK and Head of Modern British & Irish Art at Sotheby\u2019s, explained during a press briefing. \u201cHe\u2019d had a stroke in 1953 so for him (how he was perceived) was important at that time. He\u2019d won the election in 1951 by a narrow margin, and there was quite a lot of debate about him and his leadership.\u201d While the painting itself was destroyed, a painted study of Churchill \u2014 created by Sutherland in preparation for the infamous birthday portrait \u2014 had been on display at the UK\u2019s Blenheim Palace in April, in the room where Churchill was born 150 years ago. Sutherland gave the study to his friend Alfred Hecht, who kept it for the rest of his life before gifting it to the current owner.\u00a0After its stint at the palace, it travelled to Sotheby\u2019s in New York and London ahead of it\u2019s first ever auction on June 6, where it fetched \u00a3660,000 ($842,490); lower than it\u2019s estimate of \u00a3800,000 ($1,024,000), but still the second highest price for a portrait of Churchill. \u201c(Sutherland) caught him in a much more relaxed, intimate way,\u201d Zlattinger said of the study, a small canvas painted in oils. \u201cIt\u2019s a very different depiction to the (later) painting which obviously Churchill didn\u2019t like and was later destroyed.\u201d Controlling the narrative Churchill was far from the only leader to micromanage his image, though; rulers have been controlling and falsifying their images for centuries. Sculptures of Ancient Egyptian pharaohs were stylized in ways to demonstrate their power. The female pharaoh Hatshepsut of the Eighteenth Dynasty diverted from reality completely by having herself depicted with a male torso. In the UK, Queen Elizabeth I is perhaps the most obvious example of a ruler distorting their image. Robert Blyth, Senior Curator of World and Maritime History at Royal Museums Greenwich, told CNN that after her 40s Elizabeth \u201csimply didn\u2019t age\u201d. In The Rainbow Portrait, one of her most famous paintings, any wrinkles a woman in her 60s might have had are carefully smoothed over. Queen Victoria, crowned more than 250 years after Elizabeth, also used painting to disguise her age, though the academic Ira B. Nadel wrote that her interest in photography eventually made her \u201cintolerant of idealized or inaccurate portraits.\u201d Blyth explains that, like Churchill, \u201ca touch of vanity\u201d drove monarchs\u2019 tightly controlled image; \u201cWho would want to have their portrait painted and look exactly as they do?\u201d, he joked.\u202fHowever, leaders also needed to provide political stability. Elizabeth I was \u201cthe end of the Tudor line\u201d, Blyth noted. \u201cThe idea of her image reflecting any frailty would have caused suspicion.\u201d Dr Caroline Rae, an associate lecturer in History of Art at University College London, agreed. \u201cIt was a period of big changes, people being beheaded,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cMortality is something which causes instability. (Elizabeth) knows things are maybe not as stable as one might think. She\u2019s in a precarious position.\u201d Altering public perceptions Churchill himself faced political precarity. An already tumultuous career landed him in Downing Street during the Second World War, but he was voted out almost as soon as it was over. He did become Prime Minister for a second time in 1951, but his Conservative Party only had a 17-seat majority and, in April 1955, six months after the birthday portrait debacle, Churchill resigned over ill health. \u201cThere was the Suez crisis happening, and Stalin had died in 1953, so there was a lot of stuff going on,\u201d Zlattinger said. \u201cHis health and political position at that time contributed to him being particularly controlling about how that portrait was created and perceived,\u201d Bryn Sayles, Head of Sale, Modern & Post-War British Art at Sotheby\u2019s, told CNN. \u201cBut even on earlier commissions, Churchill was quite famously a very tricky sitter and wanted to be depicted in a particular way. For instance, he made sculptor Jacob Epstein take out a bit of flab from underneath his chin (in a work), so from the beginning, Churchill understood the importance of his image as a politician and was very clear about how he felt that image should be presented to the public.\u201d Historic photographs of the UK\u2019s royal family were also regularly altered, however, not everyone was happy about it. Swiss historian Alexis Schwarzenbach reported that Queen Elizabeth, wife of King George VI and mother of Queen Elizabeth II, returned her 50th birthday photo to photographer Cecil Beaton in 1950, with instructions to reduce the amount of retouching done to her lips and chin. Just four years later, Churchill\u2019s very different reaction to his own \u2018imperfections\u2019 led to the scene now immortalized in \u201cThe Crown\u201d \u2014 a factor which Sayles explains has ironically piqued buyers\u2019 interests in owning his portraits. \u201cAfter \u201cThe Crown\u201d episode and Gary Oldman\u2019s portrayal of Churchill in the \u201cDarkest Hour\u201d movie, we literally had new collectors coming in the market looking for Churchill paintings because there was a renewed interest in him.\u201d While Churchill certainly would not have appreciated fresh attention on his hated portrait, buyers appetite for the study proves that the legacy of one of the UK\u2019s most famous leaders is far from over yet.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/19/style/graham-sutherland-winston-churchill-portrait/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "travel_harry-styles-holmes-chapel-tour", "text": "Before 2010, Holmes Chapel was but another quiet leafy village in northern England. There was the little train station with services to Manchester and Crewe, a handful of local shops and, a short walk out of town, the 180-year-old Twemlow Viaduct on the banks of the River Dane. Then a teenager with dimples and curly hair, who worked part-time at the local bakery, went down to London to audition for \u201cThe X Factor\u201d TV show. That teen was Harry Styles, who became part of bestselling boy band One Direction before scaling new heights with his solo career. Holmes Chapel\u2019s fame began when it appeared in the 2013 One Direction documentary \u201cThis Is Us\u201d and, for Styles\u2019 legions of dedicated fans around the world \u2013 known as \u201cHarries\u201d \u2013 his youthful haunts were anointed as new shrines on a pop pilgrimage. The prime destination is the viaduct, where the pop star had his first kiss and, in the documentary, wrote his name on the wall in chalk. But, say locals, with an estimated 5,000 international fans visiting the 6,700-population village each year, road safety has become a concern. Harry Styles rescued a baby mole So, a year on from introducing a free map with safe walking routes around the village, the Holmes Chapel Partnership community group has this weekend launched Harry\u2019s Home Village Tour. It\u2019s a leisurely 2.5-to-three-hour stroll around Harry hotspots \u2013 allowing plenty of time for selfies and social content \u2013 guided by trained experts in both local history and Harry lore, some of whom share stories of their brushes with the man himself. \u201cMy favorite Harry Styles memory was when he helped me rescue a baby mole that my cats had brought into the house, and it had burrowed underneath the carpet,\u201d recalls tour guide Jill Booth, 58, who, as a former neighbor with a son the same age, has known Styles since he was a young child. There were 150 applicants for the tour guide roles, many from overseas, and the interview process involved an 80-question quiz on both the star and his home town, as well as a trial presentation at the viaduct. Other guides, such as 21-year-old Isabella Boughey from nearby Stoke-on-Trent, are from the Harry fanbase. As a child, Boughey watched \u201cThe X Factor\u201d with her mother and he\u2019s held a special place in her heart ever since. \u201cI just love how he embodies happiness and positivity,\u201d she tells CNN Travel. \u2018The best job in the world\u2019 The tour starts at Holmes Chapel train station, where station master Graham Blake has for years been welcoming fans who\u2019ve traveled from everywhere from Australia to Mexico and beyond. Blake remembers Styles being at the station weekly as he traveled down to London as he got through the stages of \u201cThe X Factor\u201d reality show. He was a \u201clovely lad,\u201d he recalls. \u201cHe was always ahead with the fashion and everything. He\u2019d wear these jeans with his Calvin Klein boxers and his little bobbly hat.\u201d He shows us the sixth edition of the train station\u2019s visitor book, which is overflowing with heartfelt messages from fans. Harry Styles\u2019 father Des stops by from time to time to pick up the completed books to pass onto his son. Of his role as a mentor to Harry fans, he says, \u201cIt\u2019s made my job the best job in the world now, because I get to meet people from all over the world who come in and have a chat.\u201d The ticket office is bedecked with Harry Styles-themed memorabilia, including a lifesize cutout, and another 2D Harry greets us at W. Mandeville bakery, where staff and customers alike aren\u2019t fazed by the press scrum, plainly accustomed to the village\u2019s new-found fame. In shop windows there are Harry Styles coloring books; bars advertise \u201cWatermelon Sugar\u201d cocktails. It\u2019\u2019d be a tough town for any locals with Styles fatigue. Navigating the English countryside After picking up doughy treats in W. Mandeville, fans have been known to attempt to meander down to the Twemlow Viaduct along the busy A305 road, where cars travel at 50 miles per hour and there are no sidewalks. The safer route, and the one Harry Styles and other local children would have taken, is an idyllic jaunt through green fields and along the river. And on the way to the viaduct, visitors would also do well to have an understanding of the Countryside Code of England and Wales, with its guidance on navigating private land and local livestock. It\u2019s busy at the viaduct while we are there, our tour group clutching the slate hearts we\u2019ve been given to write messages on, to discourage adding to the Harry-inspired graffiti that covers the brickwork. It doesn\u2019t dissuade a herd of cattle from wandering among us, at risk of trampling the blanket upon which fans are sat making friendship bracelets. Friends Phoebe Hodges and Mia Tesolin, both 18, have traveled from Canberra, Australia, to see Harry Styles\u2019 hometown. \u201cI like all the greenery and all the houses,\u201d says Hodges. Tesolin agrees, \u201cThe scenery is definitely really beautiful.\u201d The tour has yet to be officially endorsed by Harry Styles himself, although Peter Whiers, chair of the Holmes Chapel Partnership, tells CNN that they\u2019ve reached out to his management team via his mother. (CNN has also contacted his music label for comment.) This isn\u2019t the first time Whiers has been linked to Styles through road safety. \u201cI probably oversaw his cycling skills when he was about 10,\u201d he says, having been in charge of preparing children from his school for their cycling proficiency test, a national bike safety program. \u2018Messages of love\u2019 One location that the tour doesn\u2019t take in is the newly reopened Fortune City Chinese restaurant, which \u2013 when we peer in through the darkened windows on a Friday afternoon \u2013 resembles any other small-town dining spot. It is, however, where 18-year-old Harry Styles took his then girlfriend, 23-year-old Taylor Swift, for a date way back in 2012. A photo capturing the moment was shared on Twitter at the time, with Styles looking considerably more enthusiastic about the night out than Swift. Whiers tells CNN that the fan base is predominantly girls and young women and that they\u2019re \u201cgenerally very respectful.\u201d \u201cI think, when you look at the messages that they write in Graham\u2019s book at the station and also the messages they leave on the wall, they\u2019re all messages of love,\u201d he says. The Harry Styles song \u201cTreat People with Kindness\u201d has been picked up as a mantra by fans and our tour around Holmes Chapel has been notably wholesome. The price of the tour, \u00a320 ($25), feels steep, but the partnership only introduced it after first producing free walking maps. The tour maps come with discounts to local businesses and they\u2019re hoping for a hot trade in tour t-shirts. From Japan to Austria to the Balearics, there are small communities in revolt against their villages being taken over by tourists. When life gives you lemons, make lemonade. In Holmes Chapel, when life gave them watermelons, they made watermelon sugar.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/harry-styles-holmes-chapel-tour/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_08_tech_hong-kong-uber-taxis-intl-hnk", "text": "They hire their Uber through the app just like any other passenger, and hop in the back of the car. But halfway through the ride, the mood changes and they reveal their identity. \u201cPull over here. It\u2019s you. You are in trouble for driving an Uber,\u201d the passenger tells his driver, during one of a few recent encounters captured in video and circulated online in Hong Kong. The passengers aren\u2019t traffic cops. They are vigilante taxi drivers taking direct action, having become increasingly frustrated about Hong Kong authorities\u2019 failure to regulate the ride-hailing platform. After the car pulls over, they hand over the driver, often still reeling in shock, to the police officers they have called. \u201cYou may say this is provocative. But without these videos, people may think we inflate the numbers of \u2018white-plate vehicles\u2019 out there,\u201d one of the taxi drivers who took part in a sting operation, and asked to be only identified as Ka Chun, told CNN. \u201cWhite-plate vehicles\u201d is how taxi drivers colloquially refer to Uber. \u201cWe just want the government to enforce the law.\u201d Uber (UBER) remains technically illegal in Hong Kong, which it entered in 2014. But it has thrived under the ambiguous approach of officials keen to project an image of technological modernity. \u201cUber is often framed as innovation, which seems to contribute to the \u2018smart city\u2019 vision \u2013 something that the Hong Kong government has strived to be,\u201d said Oliver Chan, an assistant communications studies professor who specializes in the gig economy at Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK). Ads for the US-headquartered company are widespread, and its drivers are highly unlikely to face problems with the authorities. Taxi drivers have for years complained about how Uber has flouted local laws, upended the market, and chipped away their already modest earnings. But their recent acts of vigilantism appear to have backfired. Instead of rallying public support, the cabbies were on the receiving end of a backlash, with passengers taking to social media to share their bad experiences of rude taxi drivers, ride rejections and opportunistic charging during heavy rains and the city\u2019s regular summer typhoons. \u201cThey charge arbitrarily and refuse to take passengers. And yet, they have the audacity to go on sting operations,\u201d one person wrote on LIHKG, a popular local internet forum, adding: \u201cShameless people know no bounds.\u201d Others have retaliated by reporting law-breaking taxi drivers to police. Pictures of taxis parking in restricted areas flooded the internet in posts calling for people to report them. WhatsApp groups set up by Uber drivers also discuss how to retaliate, one driver told CNN. So tense is the backlash that Hong Kong leader John Lee, when asked about the furor by reporters last week, acknowledged the \u201cfierce public debate\u201d and appealed for calm. He urged taxi drivers to stay away from any vigilante acts. As with New York\u2019s amber-painted medallion taxis and London\u2019s black hackney cabs, Hong Kong\u2019s 15,000 red urban taxis are emblematic of the city. But they are not exactly known for their friendliness or reliable service. Passenger Lau Chi-tim recalled being charged double during a typhoon a few years ago. Drivers often charge a little more because their insurance does not cover extreme weather conditions. But Lau said: \u201cThe trip lasted only 15 minutes and most of the journey was inside a tunnel anyway. Where is the risk?\u201d Another passenger lamented how selective taxi drivers can be. \u201cPeople with pets, a pram, wanting to cross the harbor, or going anywhere that may be crowded\u2026 they just reject you,\u201d Jason Chan said. Similar complaints abound, despite refusal to take passengers being an offense under the Hong Kong law. Those who prefer Uber see it as an alternative to the poor service they have long tolerated and would rather pay a little more for a smoother ride. An Uber driver, who gave only his name Mo for fear of being identified by authorities, said passengers told him they preferred Uber drivers\u2019 manners, and quality of driving. \u201cWe don\u2019t dare swerve around on the road because it\u2019s our own vehicle,\u201d he said. But for Ka Chun, the driver who went undercover, it\u2019s about defending their interest and an institution that he and his fellow cabbies invested time and money to be part of. \u201cThey have an impact on us because these white-plate vehicles can take passengers without a taxi license,\u201d he said, speaking of a permit that can cost a fortune in the city where properties, and even parking spaces, are traded as speculative commodities. Hong Kong\u2019s transport authority has issued some 18,000 taxi licenses \u2013 including for non-urban blue and green cabs - and they are currently traded for up to $400,000 (HK$3.2 million) in a free market. Annual insurance for a taxi also costs up to 10 times that for private vehicles. Drivers who don\u2019t own a taxi pay rental of 550 Hong Kong dollars (about $70) for a 12-hour shift, almost a third of what they make on an average day, according to Ka Chun. \u201cUber drivers don\u2019t need any capital whatsoever as they are using their own car to take passengers,\u201d he said. Patrick Tam, secretary general of the Hong Kong Taxi & Public Light Bus Association, acknowledged the complaints against some unruly taxi drivers, and said he supported the police going after them. \u201cThese taxi drivers should face tough punishment. But it doesn\u2019t make vehicles operating without a proper license less of a problem,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just want fair treatment.\u201d So far, Hong Kong police have said they had not arrested any Uber drivers ensnared in the amateur sting operations. Estyn Chung, general manager of Uber in Hong Kong, noted that the company launched its Uber Taxi service in 2020 to give riders the option to get a taxi on its app. \u201cWe know from elsewhere around the world that taxi and ride-sharing services can thrive alongside each other. Hong Kong is not an exception,\u201d he said. Creating harmony between traditional cabbies and gig-economy drivers can be tricky. And CUHK\u2019s Chan said that, after years of ambiguity, Hong Kong is already playing catch-up. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to say the extent to which the government wants to promote Uber, and more broadly, ride-hailing platforms at this point,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Hong Kong\u2019s ride-hailing regulations lag behind, for example, Singapore.\u201d The city government is expected to unveil a study on online ride-hailing services in July. A spokesman said it is \u201copen-minded\u201d on the apps, though \u201cthey must be in compliance with the relevant law and regulations.\u201d \u201cThe government should require them to get a different driver permit and insurance even if it legalizes their operation,\u201d said Ka Chun. \u201cOtherwise, why should I get a taxi license? I could drive white-plate vehicles.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/08/tech/hong-kong-uber-taxis-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "world"}}

Fighters from the Rapid Support Forces (RSF)\u00a0plundered the facility on Saturday stealing an ambulance among other supplies, the aid agency said. \u201cOn Saturday, MSF and the Ministry of Health suspended all activities in South Hospital, El Fasher, North Darfur, after RSF soldiers stormed the facility, opened fire, and looted it, including stealing an MSF ambulance,\u201d MSF Sudan said on social media Saturday. The hospital was the only one in the region \u201cequipped to deal with mass casualties\u201d and \u201cwas the main referral hospital for treating war-wounded.\u201d It was also one of the two hospitals in El Fasher with surgical capacity, according to MSF. As a result, patients are being moved to Paediatric and Saudi hospitals \u201cwhich were unprepared for such an influx,\u201d it added. The NGO added on X, formerly known as Twitter, there were only ten patients and a reduced medical team at the hospital at the time. Medical teams had already began transferring patients and services to other facilities earlier in the week due to intensified fighting in the region, it added. CNN has reached out to the RSF for comment. MSF said most patients and the remaining medical team, which included all MSF staff, were able to flee the violence but they are unable to say for certain if there were any casualties due to the chaos that ensued. The medical facility had already been hit by mortar shells and bullets multiple times in the preceding weeks between May 25th\u00a0and June 3rd\u00a0resulting in two deaths and 14 injuries among patients and caretakers, according to MSF. \u201cIt is outrageous that the RSF opened fire inside the hospital. This is not an isolated incident, as staff and patients have endured attacks on the facility for weeks from all sides, but opening fire inside a hospital crosses a line,\u201d said MSF\u2019s Head of Emergencies Michel Lacharite, as quoted by MSF Sudan on X Saturday. \u201cWarring parties must halt attacks on medical care. Hospitals are closing. Remaining facilities can\u2019t handle mass casualties. We are trying to find solutions. The responsibility is on warring parties to spare medical facilities,\u201d Lacharite added. Spokesperson for Foreign Affairs & Security Policy of the EU Nabila Massrali\u00a0said on X Sunday,\u00a0\u201cThe EU is appalled by RSF-Janjaweed assault of staff at the El Fasher South Hospital in Darfur also looting it, as it did with many other hospitals in Sudan.\u201d \u201cWe remind again the [RSF] to show restraint and respect International Humanitarian Law,\u201d she added. The United Nations (UN) has said\u00a0that El Fasher hosts around 1.8 million people who are at \u201cimminent risk of famine.\u201d The UN\u2019s International Organization for Migration (IOM)\u00a0said an escalation in fighting from April 1st\u00a0this year between the warring RSF and Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) was monitored across El Fasher, displacing almost 130,000 people in just April and May this year. Civil war in Sudan between the SAF and RSF broke out in April 2023.

In a statement, the IDF claimed freed hostages Almog Meir Jan, Andrey Kozlov and Shlomi Ziv were held by journalist Abdallah Aljamal and his family members at their home in the central Gaza camp. The three men, who were kidnapped by Hamas militants from the Nova music festival\u00a0on October 7, were\u00a0rescued after being held captive for 246 days, in an IDF special operation on Saturday along with a fourth hostage, Noa Argamani. There are varying reports on the number of Palestinians killed during the operation. The latest figures from Gazan authorities say 274 Palestinians were killed and 698 injured \u2013 which would mark one of the deadliest days in months for people living in Gaza. The IDF has disputed those numbers, saying it estimated the number of casualties from the operation was \u201cunder 100.\u201d CNN cannot independently verify either side\u2019s figures. Aljamal was killed in the IDF operation along with his wife and father, according to Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor chairman Ramy Abdu, citing initial testimony gathered by the group documenting the IDF\u2019s alleged killings in the Nuseirat camp on Saturday. Aljamal lived on the first floor of a multi-story building, according to Euro-Med. The IDF said the hostages were found on the third floor. CNN is attempting to reach out to people familiar with Aljamal. Israeli claims The IDF statement claimed Aljamal was a Hamas operative and a journalist for\u00a0Al Jazeera. The allegations come a month after Israel expelled the Qatar-based network from the country under a new wartime law that allows the Israeli government to ban foreign media it deems harmful to its security. In a statement Sunday,\u00a0Al Jazeera called Israel\u2019s allegations \u201ccompletely unfounded\u201d and \u201ca continuation of the process of slander and misinformation aimed at harming Al Jazeera\u2019s reputation, professionalism, and independence.\u201d Aljamal never worked for the network but had once contributed to an opinion piece published on its website, Al Jazeera said. Al Jazeera\u2019s website credits Aljamal as the author of an op-ed\u00a0published in 2019. His biography page on the site describes him as a \u201cGaza-based reporter and photojournalist.\u201d Aljamal was a freelance contributor to The Palestine Chronicle, according to the US-based online outlet. The Chronicle said it was saddened by Aljamal\u2019s death, noting his reports \u201chave focused entirely on the humanitarian situation in Gaza.\u201d Meanwhile, an X account linked to Israel\u2019s Foreign Ministry claimed Aljamal was a spokesperson for the Palestinian Ministry of Labor, citing unnamed sources in Gaza. Without providing evidence, the Israeli X account also claimed that Argamani was held in Aljamal\u2019s home, before later saying the three men were held captive there. \u2018Hell on earth\u2019 The Israeli military operation Saturday to free the four hostages took place mid-morning, when the streets were teeming with people shopping at a nearby market. It left a trail of devastation in civilian areas, where the IDF claimed\u00a0Hamas militants were embedded. Residents described the Israeli attack as \u201chell on earth,\u201d with scenes of carnage following the strikes that led up to the rescue. Eyewitnesses described civilians being struck down by airstrikes and shrapnel. Footage from\u00a0the nearby Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital showed trucks and ambulances transferring injured people and bodies to the hospital. Graphic footage shows many Palestinians, including children, injured with blood on their faces and clothes, and the hospital\u2019s emergency room overwhelmed. The four rescued hostages are in \u201cgood medical condition\u201d and are receiving medical attention, according to the IDF. More than 70 hostages held in Gaza since Hamas\u2019 deadly surprise attack on October 7 are believed to be alive.\u00a0Intensive negotiations over a ceasefire and a deal to swap hostages for Palestinian prisoners have stalled recently following months of talks. Hostage freeing operations are extremely rare. More than 100 hostages were freed under a temporary truce last year, while Israel has rescued seven hostages by military means. However, Saturday\u2019s operation shows such operations are still possible and may encourage further efforts from the Israeli military, given a major goal of Israel\u2019s Gaza offensive is to rescue the remaining hostages. In a video address following the operation, IDF spokesperson Rear Adm.\u00a0Daniel Hagari commended Israeli special forces for successfully rescuing the four hostages, and said the military would not lose sight of those still held by Hamas. \u201cWe will not stop fighting for their freedom,\u201d he said. Israel last month pressed ahead with its ground operation in central Rafah despite\u00a0international condemnation\u00a0for its escalation in the southern Gaza city where some\u00a01.3 million Palestinians\u00a0were taking shelter before Israel began its operation there.

{"id": "2024_06_05_europe_putin-russia-western-nations-ukraine-intl-hnk", "text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned Western countries they\u2019re taking a \u201cvery serious and dangerous step\u201d by supplying weapons to Ukraine, which could result in Moscow arming their enemies. Ukraine has relied heavily on arms supplied by Western allies to beat back Russian forces since Putin\u2019s full-scale invasion began more than two years ago. And last week, US President Joe Biden for the first time gave Kyiv permission to use American munitions to carry out limited strikes inside Russian territory, after several European nations removed restrictions on how weapons they supply can be used. \u201cSupplying weapons to a conflict zone is always a bad thing,\u201d Putin told editors from international news agencies on the sidelines of the annual economic forum in St. Petersburg on Wednesday. \u201cEspecially if this is linked to the fact that those who supply them are not only delivering weapons but managing them.\u201d Putin also warned that Russia could retaliate if Western countries are deemed to have become directly involved in the Ukraine conflict. \u201cIn the end, if we see that these countries become involved in a war against us, what they are doing makes them directly involved in a war against the Russian Federation, we reserve the right to act the same way,\u201d he said. \u201cOverall, it leads to some serious problems.\u201d And he raised the prospect of retaliatory action\u00a0by asking why Russia would \u201cnot have the right to supply our weapons of the same class to those regions of the world where there will be strikes on the sensitive facilities of those countries that are doing this against Russia?\u201d The Ukrainian military has started using US-supplied HIMARS rocket systems to hit Russian air defense systems, weapons depots and other military targets\u00a0on Russian territory, a member of the Ukrainian Parliament told CNN on Wednesday. Yehor Cherniev, deputy chairman of the Ukrainian Parliament\u2019s Committee on National Security, Defense and Intelligence,\u00a0said the American weapons had allowed them \u201cto significantly reduce the shelling of Kharkiv by Russian S-300 missiles.\u201d In his comments Wednesday, Putin said Russia would improve air defense systems to destroy incoming missiles. He also singled out Berlin for criticism, following remarks last week from the leaders of France and Germany that Ukraine should be allowed to use their weapons against targets inside Russia from which Moscow attacks Ukraine. The appearance of German tanks in Ukraine had resulted in an \u201cethical shock\u201d in Russia, where the attitude toward Germany had previously been \u201cvery good,\u201d Putin said. \u201cNow, when they say that some more missiles will appear that will strike targets on Russian territory, this, of course, is ultimately destroying Russo-German relations,\u201d he added. Speaking alongside French President Emmanuel Macron on May 28, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Ukraine was allowed to defend itself as long as it respected the conditions given by the countries that supplied the weapons \u2013 including the United States \u2013 and international law. \u201cUkraine has every possibility under international law for what it is doing. That has to be said explicitly,\u201d Scholz said. \u201cI find it strange when some people argue that it should not be allowed to defend itself and take measures that are suitable for this.\u201d Ukraine had for months pleaded with Washington to allow it to strike targets on Russian soil with US weapons, as Moscow launched a brutal aerial and ground assault on Kharkiv, knowing that its troops could retreat to Russian soil to regroup and its weapons depots could not be targeted with Western arms. The US is standing firm in not allowing Ukraine to use the most formidable munition it has been given to fire into Russia: the long-range missiles known as ATACMS that can hit targets 300 kilometers (nearly 200 miles) away. Instead, Ukraine can only use shorter-range missiles known as GMLRS, which have a range of around 70 kilometers (around 40 miles).", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/europe/putin-russia-western-nations-ukraine-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "world"}}

And at next month\u2019s upcoming Games, Louis Vuitton are hoping they too will become a hallmark of the same grand occasion. The luxury house\u2019s distinctive Damier checkerboard trunks will house the Olympic torch as it travels across France, and Vuitton has created medal cases for the Olympic and Paralympic Games. Seven French athletes \u2014 from fencer Enzo Lefort and swimmer L\u00e9on Marchand to wheelchair tennis champion Pauline D\u00e9roul\u00e8de and para-cyclist Marie Patouillet \u2014 will also act as ambassadors for the brand. The Olympics, and the extraordinary journeys that athletes take to reach them, closely align with the values at the heart of the French luxury fashion house, its chairman and CEO Pietro Beccari told CNN in an interview at the brand\u2019s headquarters in Paris. \u201cWe talk about excellence, we spoke about quality, we spoke about being prepared for every challenge, and that is something that is very close to our heart,\u201d Beccari said, adding that Louis Vuitton is \u201cvery proud to be a French group\u201d and willing to support its home Olympics in the \u201cmost beautiful city in the world.\u201d As one would expect from a company who also designs the trophy trunks for such events as the soccer World Cup and the F1 Grand Prix de Monaco, these are no ordinary pieces of luggage. The interiors of both trunks are lined with matte black leather; one featuring circular \u201csockets\u201d in its base and lid to safely house and transport the Olympic torch, while the other contains enough drawers to store hundreds of medals. LVMH \u2013 the luxury conglomerate that owns Louis Vuitton \u2013 spent \u20ac150 million ($163 million) on its sponsorship deal with the Olympics, Vogue reported citing sources, though calculating the precise returns on this investment is \u201cdifficult,\u201d said Beccari.  \u201cWe believe this campaign is building values, building desirability,\u201d he said. \u201cQuantifying it is very difficult, not that we didn\u2019t try but it\u2019s very very difficult or impossible.\u201d The fashion house has long associated itself with sport, sponsoring nautical events like the Americas Cup, as well as launching a recent campaign centered around the friendship of tennis legends Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. \u201cWe are very close to sport,\u201d Beccari said, recalling the slogan \u201cVictory travels in Louis Vuitton,\u201d the fashion house used when one of its trunks housed the FIFA World Cup in 2010. \u201cI think it incarnates very well the DNA of Louis Vuitton, of what I was saying before, the challenges, the willingness to overcome yourself, to reach your destination and to be willing to go and discover more.\u201d This messaging underpinned a new campaign with Federer and Nadal sitting on a Louis Vuitton case on a snowy mountain in the Dolomites, discussing their rivalry, their biggest achievements and their sporting heroes. They\u2019re \u201ctwo beautiful young people that started from their little villages respectively in two different parts of Europe,\u201d Beccari said, \u201cand they became who they became so it\u2019s really part of this philosophy of excellence, of quality, of envy to surpass yourself over time again.\u201d While Louis Vuitton posted record profits last year and LVMH outperformed other luxury brands, the current economic environment with rising inflation leaving consumers with less disposable income poses challenges ahead, though Beccari downplayed such difficulties. \u201cIn terms of crisis, you always have to have the courage to see the opportunities and that\u2019s what we do,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there is a curve, and we like to do the curve with speed, so when the road will be straight again we\u2019ll have sufficient speed to be ahead of the others.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/style/louis-vuitton-pietro-beccari-olympics/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "world"}}

Excessive heat warnings are in effect for more than 18 million people in California, Nevada, Arizona and Utah. A majority of these warnings, which are the most extreme form of heat alert issued by the National Weather Service, remain active through Friday. Heat has already taken its toll. Multiple people in different parts of the US have died due to heat-related illnesses since last weekend. Four migrants died \u201cfrom heat stroke and dehydration\u201d while triple digit temperatures baked the US-Mexico border last weekend, according to the US Border Patrol, El Paso Sector. In the East, a 59-year-old man died of heat-related complications in Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland, officials said Wednesday. Additional details about the man\u2019s death, which was the state\u2019s first heat-related death of the year, were not released. Heat also proved challenging for firefighters battling a blaze in California\u2019s Napa County Wednesday. Four firefighters were sent to area hospitals for injuries related to difficult terrain and \u201chot summer conditions,\u201d according to\u00a0CAL Fire\u2019s Sonoma-Lake-Napa Unit. All four are expected to make full recoveries. More than a dozen daily high temperature records fell earlier this week in the West as the heat dome strengthened. A few dozen more could be broken through the weekend. Flagstaff, Arizona; Reno, Nevada; and Fresno, California, are just a handful of cities where the day\u2019s high temperature record could fall on one or more days this week. Phoenix sizzled Wednesday but fell just short of its first 110-degree day of the year, a threshold it blew past Thursday as it soared to 113 degrees, also smashing the city\u2019s previous record for the day by 2 degrees. High temperatures hit 111 degrees in Las Vegas, tying this year with 2010 for the earliest such reading on record in the city. Death Valley, the hottest place in the world, clocked in with a temperature of 122 degrees, topping a daily record of 121 degrees it set back in 1996. Even the brutal desert landscape doesn\u2019t typically get this hot until mid-to-late June. Triple-digit temperatures will persist in California\u2019s Central Valley into the weekend with 110s sticking around in desert areas of California, Nevada and Arizona. Summerlike heat will expand northward Friday and reach the Northwest. Records could be broken in parts of Oregon, Washington and Idaho from Friday through the weekend. While it won\u2019t be record-breaking, Seattle will contend with high temperatures in the upper 70s Friday and could come close to 80 degrees on Saturday. Highs like these are 10 degrees warmer than what\u2019s typical for early June.

There\u2019s the Art Deco curved crown of the Chrysler Building, the sweeping isosceles triangles that twist around One World Trade Center, the stepped limestone and granite rectangles of the Empire State Building and the triangular prism of the Flatiron Building. And now, a multi-billion-dollar tower featuring floor-to-ceiling glass will add another dimension to the cityscape, according to new details unveiled by New York City Mayor Eric Adams this week. Stretching up 62 stories, a planned office tower at 350 Park Avenue will provide space for more than 6,000 jobs, plus 1.8 million square feet of commercial office space, according to a press release. It will be funded by Vornado Realty Trust, Kenneth Griffin, founder and CEO of global investment firm Citadel, and building and management company Rudin. White columns will frame a new public concourse at the base of the new building on Park Avenue, complete with green space, seating and art displays, images show. Above, landscaped terraces will top each section of the glass-clad tower which will house the offices for Citadel and market making firm Citadel Securities. Adams hailed the project in the release, saying it will help \u201csupercharge our economy and expand New York City\u2019s iconic skyline,\u201d building on \u201ccontinued efforts to energize Midtown Manhattan as the world\u2019s most important business address and an economic engine for working-class New Yorkers.\u201d Architects Foster + Partners have designed the building, which will replace the existing 30-story tower currently at the site in Midtown Manhattan just a few blocks away from landmarks like the Rockefeller Center, St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral and Grand Central Station. As New York continues to deal with the economic aftershocks wrought by the Covid-19 pandemic, Adams and his administration said in their respective statements that they hoped this project would continue the city\u2019s recovery. \u201cThis investment opens a new chapter for Midtown \u2014 and closes the book on those who predicted its demise,\u201d said deputy mayor for operations Meera Joshi. \u201cMidtown\u2019s revitalization is being led by its public realm \u2014 including investments in Fifth Avenue, with the crown jewels of Central Park and Bryant Park at either end. Together, with our business improvement district and parks partners, we are reintroducing Fifth Avenue to the world and creating a vibrant live, work, play community for a new era,\u201d Joshi added. Building this new office space comes at a fraught time for the commercial real estate market as businesses struggle to entice workers back to the office after years of working from home. This has left vast tranches of office space vacant or underused, causing the value of such buildings to plummet at the same time as historically high interest rates have made it harder for real estate developers \u2014\u00a0who often take out huge loans to finance projects \u2014\u00a0to make good on their repayments. The project will begin the city\u2019s public review process early next year and the tower is expected to be completed by 2032, according to the release.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/20/style/park-avenue-skyscraper-new-york-skyline-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_10_sport_carlos-alcaraz-french-open-tennis-spt-intl", "text": "As a child, Carlos Alcaraz used to run home from school to watch the French Open on TV, dreaming of one day playing on the tournament\u2019s clay courts and becoming champion. That dream became a reality on Sunday as the Spaniard defeated world No. 4 Alexander Zverev in five sets to lift his third grand slam title \u2013 all at the age of only 21. In a gritty and often unpredictable performance on Court Philippe-Chatrier, Alcaraz showed his trademark fight and resilience against Zverev, coming back from two sets to one down to become the youngest man to win major titles on clay, grass and hard courts. \u201cHonestly, first of all, I\u2019m exhausted,\u201d Alcaraz told CNN Sport\u2019s Amanda Davies the day after claiming his first title at Roland Garros. \u201cIt was a really tough one. It is a dream come true for me. I really wanted to lift this trophy one day, and then to be able to do it is a great feeling. \u201cThis tournament, I\u2019ve watched it since I was five, six years old \u2026 Being in this position right now is so, so special,\u201d he added. With Alcaraz\u2019s latest success comes yet another tattoo. He already has the dates of his grand slam wins at the US Open and Wimbledon \u2013 the latter alongside a strawberry synonymous with the tournament \u2013 inked on his skin, and now plans to get the Eiffel Tower and Sunday\u2019s date on his left ankle. It seems a fitting choice: after his victory in the City of Light, Alcaraz shared an old photo of himself aged 12, watching the tournament on a big screen in the shadow of the Paris landmark. Is he worried about running out of skin space, should he continue to accumulate more grand slam titles? \u201cThis is good news if that happens,\u201d said Alcaraz. \u201cI said to my family and to my team that it\u2019s going to be the first grand slam. If I win another French Open, I\u2019m not going to get a tattoo.\u201d With his victory over Zverev, the world No. 2 joins a long line of Spanish men to have lifted the French Open title. Rafael Nadal leads the way with a record-breaking 14 titles, while Juan Carlos Ferrero, Albert Costa, Carlos Moy\u00e1 and Sergi Bruguera have all been champions since 1993. \u201cI really wanted to put my name on that list as well,\u201d said Alcaraz, who is now coached by 2003 winner Ferrero. Having sustained an arm injury ahead of this year\u2019s French Open, the Murcia native withdrew from the Italian Open but has exceeded his expectations physically over the past two weeks, winning four of his seven matches in three sets. It was only against Zverev and new world No. 1 Jannik Sinner that Alcaraz went the distance \u2013 the first man in the Open Era to win the final and the semifinal of the French Open in five sets. After losing the third set against Zverev, letting slip a 5-2 lead, he had to dig deep into his energy reserves and raise his intensity, racing around the court and chasing down every shot. The two highlights were a so-called \u201cbanana\u201d forehand \u2013 made famous by Nadal \u2013 in the fourth set and a stunning backhand passing shot when Alcaraz had seemed certain to lose the point in the deciding set. \u201cIf I lost, I wanted to do it fighting until the last ball, running, playing my best tennis,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s all I thought about in that moment: to keep trying to find solutions.\u201d Alcaraz\u2019s attention now turns to Wimbledon, where he will defend the title he won in dramatic fashion against Novak Djokovic last year, and then the Olympics in Paris, which will mean a return to Roland Garros. There, he hopes to play doubles alongside Nadal \u2013 potentially one of the 22-time grand slam champion\u2019s final tournaments \u2013 as well as going for a gold medal in the singles competition. \u201cI\u2019ve won Roland Garros and I\u2019m going for the Olympics,\u201d said Alcaraz. \u201cI\u2019m going to try to get both.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/sport/carlos-alcaraz-french-open-tennis-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_07_asia_japan-birth-rate-population-dating-app-intl-hnk", "text": "Japan\u2019s fertility rate, which has seen a precipitous fall for many years, has reached another record low as the government ramps up efforts to encourage young people to get married and start families\u00a0\u2014\u00a0even launching its own dating app. The nation of 123.9 million people only recorded 727,277 births last year, according to new data released by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare on Friday. The fertility rate \u2013 defined as the total number of births a woman has in her lifetime \u2013 dropped from 1.26 to 1.20. For a population to remain stable, it needs a fertility rate of 2.1. Anything above that will see a population expand, with a large proportion of children and young adults, as seen in India and many African nations. But in Japan, the fertility rate has been well below that stable marker of 2.1 for half a century, experts say \u2013 it fell below that level after the 1973 global oil crisis pushed economies into recession, and never recovered. The downward trend has accelerated in recent years, with the number of deaths overtaking births each year and causing the total population to shrink \u2013 with far-reaching consequences for Japan\u2019s workforce, economy, welfare system and social fabric. In 2023, the country recorded 1.57 million deaths, according to the Health Ministry \u2013 more than double the number of births. And Japan\u2019s not having much matrimonial luck, either \u2013 the number of marriages fell by 30,000 last year, while the number of divorces rose. Experts say the decline is expected to continue for at least several decades\u00a0and is to some extent irreversible due to the country\u2019s population structure. Even if Japan were to boost its fertility rate tomorrow, its population will keep falling until the skewed ratio of young people to older adults balances out. Still, the government is now racing to soften the impact, launching new government agencies to focus specifically on this problem. It has launched initiatives such as expanding child care facilities, offering housing subsidies to parents, and in some towns, even paying couples to have children. In the capital Tokyo, local officials are trying a new tack: launching a government-run dating app, which is in early testing phases and will be fully operational later this year. \u201cPlease use it as \u2018the first step\u2019 to begin marriage hunting,\u201d the app\u2019s website says, adding that the AI-matchmaking system is provided by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government. Users are asked to take a \u201cvalues diagnostic test\u201d but there\u2019s also an option to put in the desired traits of a future partner. \u201cBased on your values and the values you seek in a partner, which can be determined by taking a diagnostic test, AI will introduce you to a compatible person,\u201d it said. \u201cWhat cannot be measured by appearance or conditions alone may lead to unexpected encounters.\u201d The app even caught the eye of billionaire Elon Musk, who wrote on X, formerly Twitter: \u201cI\u2019m glad the government of Japan recognizes the importance of this matter. If radical action isn\u2019t taken, Japan (and many other countries) will disappear!\u201d Experts have told CNN this scenario is unlikely \u2013 the fertility rate is expected to even out at some point, and the country will adjust. Japan may look very different at that point, from its demographic makeup to its economy and domestic policies, but it won\u2019t simply vanish. \u201cMarriage is a decision based on one\u2019s own values, but the Tokyo Metropolitan Government is working to build momentum for marriage so that those who think they \u2018intend to get married eventually\u2019 can take that first step,\u201d says the dating app\u2019s website. Users must be single, over 18 years old \u201cwith a desire to get married,\u201d and be living or working in Tokyo, the website says. It also lists the government\u2019s other measures to support couples \u2013 such as providing information on work-life balance, child care and housing support, men\u2019s participation in housework and child-rearing, and career counseling. \u201cWe hope that every single one of you who wishes to get married will think about what being in a \u2018couple\u2019 means to you,\u201d it says.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/asia/japan-birth-rate-population-dating-app-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_07_middleeast_un-israel-global-list-children-intl-latam", "text": "United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has added Israel\u2019s military to a global list of offenders that have committed violations against children, his spokesman confirmed on Friday. Israel had been told it is being placed on the list in the secretary-general\u2019s annual report on children in armed conflict, to be sent to the UN Security Council next Friday, Stephane Dujarric told a press briefing. Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad were also added to the list, according to a diplomatic source, along with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). Dujarric added that the Israeli UN mission was called by Guterres\u2019 chief of staff on Friday, a courtesy afforded to countries that are newly listed. \u201cIt is done to give those countries a heads-up and avoid leaks,\u201d he said. Israeli Ambassador to the UN Gilad Erdan recorded a video of himself making a phone call from his office, apparently to a UN official, and leaked part of it on social media. In the video, Erdan expressed outrage at the UN decision, calling the IDF \u201cthe most moral army in the world.\u201d \u201cThe only one who is blacklisted today is the secretary-general, whose decisions since the war started, and even before, are rewarding terrorists and incentivizing them to use children for terror acts\u2026 Shame on him!\u201d Dujarric said it was \u201cshocking and unacceptable\u201d that Erdan had apparently published the private call, saying it was \u201csomething he had never seen in my 24 years serving this organization.\u201d Israel\u2019s inclusion on the list comes after eight months of war in Gaza, in which more than 15,500 children have been killed, according to the Ministry of Health in the enclave. The war was sparked by a Hamas-led assault on Israel on October 7, which killed 1,200 people and saw some 250 others taken hostage. Many are still in captivity and Hamas\u2019 top leadership is still at large despite the Israeli onslaught. The UN\u2019s so-called blacklist has previously included countries such as Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian envoy to the UN, said the decision to add Israel to the list \u201cwill not bring back tens of thousands of our children who were killed by Israel over decades and will not restore normal life for the children who were permanently disabled by its actions.\u201d \u201cBut it is an important step in the right direction towards ending the double standards and the culture of impunity Israel has enjoyed for far too long and that left our children vulnerable to its consequences.\u201d The annual report will go to the Security Council on June 14. The official report will be published on June 18. It will be discussed at a debate in the council on June 26. Asked about ramifications, the UN spokesman said it will be up to the members to decide any action. The war has seen Israel-UN relations reach historic lows with Israeli diplomats using their platforms at the UN to denounce the world body. Israel\u2019s quarrel with the UN has gone beyond the secretary-general. Israeli officials have also criticized the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), the World Health Organization, UN Women, and the UN\u2019s Special Rapporteur for the Occupied Palestinian Territories Francesca Albanese. Meanwhile,\u00a0dozens of UN staffers\u00a0have been killed in Gaza since the conflict began, the largest loss in the world body\u2019s history. Israel has long accused UNRWA of anti-Israeli incitement, which UNRWA has repeatedly denied, and\u00a0in 2017, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sought\u00a0to dismantle the UN body, saying it should be merged with the main UN refugee agency. Since the October 7 attack, Israeli journalists and news outlets have refocused their attention on UNRWA and have\u00a0amplified stories\u00a0questioning its role in the war.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/middleeast/un-israel-global-list-children-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_04_10_style_graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers", "text": "Climbing up abandoned, unfinished floors and tightrope walking across balcony ledges, backpacks clanging with cans of alkyd and acrylic, a collective of Los Angeles graffiti artists have transformed their craft beyond urban aesthetics to champion community issues. Their choice of canvas: Oceanwide Plaza in Downtown LA. Occupying over a full square city block, the plaza was imagined as a vast mixed-use building project, offering city residents over 500 lavish condominiums, a five-star hotel, retail spaces, restaurants and a private 2-acre park. However, construction on the $1 billion project, which began in 2015, was shelved after the Chinese-backed contractor Oceanwide Holdings ran out of funding\u00a0in 2019 \u2014 and it has lain unfinished ever since. The plaza\u2019s status \u2014 and potential \u2014 as an eye-catching venue for their work spread by word of mouth within the graffiti community in recent months. Security at the site was known to be lax, an important detail as accessing the plaza\u2019s towers and other buildings constitutes trespassing. (The Los Angeles City Attorney confirmed to CNN that, as of April 3, criminal charges have been filed against 23 individuals, for violations including trespassing and possession of vandalism tools.) \u201cIt was like a gift from the graffiti gods\u2026 A giant canvas in the middle of downtown,\u201d tagger ENDEM told CNN, speaking on behalf of himself and his graffiti crew, NCT. \u201cWe were like, \u2018Let\u2019s do it right. Let\u2019s do it as if the whole world is going to see this.\u2019\u201d Historically, graffiti has often been used as protest art. While the practice dates back thousands of years, it\u2019s most commonly viewed in a contemporary context (within graffiti\u2019s \u201cmodern\u201d era, which dates back to the 1960s and 70s) as a creative vehicle for challenging societal norms and inequities \u2014 whether on the Berlin Wall in Germany or subway cars in New York City; whether painted by anonymous artists or well-known figures like Keith Haring or Banksy, even if the latter is, technically, anonymous himself. Still, neither ENDEM nor any of the other artists involved realized how famous their work on the Oceanside towers would become. Sharing his artwork on Instagram on January 31, a video from ENDEM quickly racked up tens of thousands of views: Vibrant images of bright block lettering splayed across the building\u2019s exterior paired with footage from the inside \u2014 the artist posing with shots of his spray paint cans, poised above the cityscape. The viral footage, among other visuals shared on social media, quickly opened the floodgates. Hitting Oceanside became a mark of credibility in the graffiti world; by mid-February, the number of tags and other graffiti pieces there were multiplying overnight. \u201cIt was an open house people going in and out. It was beautiful. It was like graffiti paradise,\u201d ENDEM said. \u201cIt felt exactly like the streets, but concentrated.\u201d Transformed in part into an art installation, Oceanwide became an opportunity for the graffiti artists to leave a message to the city below, and a call-out to policy makers who leave buildings to rot. \u201cGraffiti shows you where the city hurts,\u201d Roger Gastman, owner and founder of the LA-based arts organization Beyond the Streets, told CNN. Renowned for its large-scale exhibitions, immersive educational programs, pop-up events and partnerships, Beyond the Streets works to educate and celebrate the diverse dimensions of graffiti as a medium. To him, the mission of graffiti is clear: to challenge, educate, and redefine public perception of the medium. Earl Ofari Hutchinson, president of The Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable, a nonpartisan public policy forum\u00a0for civic participation and education,\u00a0sees the abandoned towers as amplifying the social issues of the community they are situated in, connecting the graffiti-laden structures to the urban blight that surrounds them in LA\u2019s Skid Row. Skid Row is a 50-block sector of downtown LA where between 8,000 and 11,000 unhoused people live in challenging, often squalid conditions. \u201cYou\u2019ve got tens of thousands of people displaced because of over urban development. And as a result of that, they\u2019re on the streets,\u201d Hutchinson told CNN, noting that the homeless population in Los Angeles is continuing to grow. (The Los Angeles Housing Services Authority reports a 9% increase in homelessness in LA county in 2023 and a 10% increase in the city from 2022.) \u201cNow, set right in the middle of that, you have\u2026 a development that will never be completed.\u201d \u201cWhat you have here is a classic urban nightmare brought on by very poor policies \u2014 fiscal, financial, budgetary and political problems (in) a city that has just gone off the rails in terms of over-development and lack of affordability,\u201d Hutchinson added. Still, Hutchinson is no fan of the graffiti either. To him, and many other LA residents who have said they disapprove of the \u201cvandalism,\u201d the plaza is a sore sight for eyes. \u201cThe problem is you\u2019re talking about violating public space and with no permission\u2026 that doesn\u2019t fly with me,\u201d Hutchinson said. \u201cThe fact of the matter is, the public has not given you approval. (And) the general public has to pay for the removal.\u201d Costs currently borne by the taxpayer at the Oceanwide Plaza site include the security details provided by the LAPD as well as the graffiti cleanup Hutchinson highlights. (\u201cThis has strained our deployment,\u201d LAPD Chief Michel Moore said during a February meeting of the Los Angeles City Council. \u201cWe have called in some officers on an overtime basis so that we can provide for these added patrols or station them at that site to deter vandals and others from gaining access.\u201d) Clean teams working in the neighborhoods surrounding Oceanwide remove on average some 2,000 square feet of graffiti per week, with that figure growing in recent months. \u201cPeople forget that people live here. People own businesses here and they don\u2019t want to have to spend the time and money to clean it up,\u201d said Blair Besten, executive director of the Historic Core of Downtown Los Angeles, an organization which works to improve the quality of life in downtown neighborhoods. The Historic Core prioritizes street sweeping, trash collection \u2014 and graffiti removal. \u201cI would hardly call what they\u2019re doing art,\u201d Besten argued of the Oceanwide taggers. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty sloppy and quick. They come in fast and they knock it out and they leave.\u201d But to Gastman, graffiti is a powerful form of expression, and a call-to-action \u2014 particularly for those who emanate from struggles within home life, gang life or societal turmoil. Graffiti culture can offer an unexpected support system for those the city has abandoned, Gastman said. It becomes a platform for them to make their voices heard. \u201cIn graffiti culture, a lot of us know each other. We\u2019re all friends. We have the same mentality \u2014 we\u2019re just trying to get up. We\u2019re just trying to get noticed,\u201d explained ENDEM. In the midst of an addiction that led to his rock bottom, graffiti became his lifeline, he explained. \u201cI was at my lowest of lows, still trying to stay sober, I needed some type of outlet,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cGraffiti is something that you can hold on to. Its bigger than me, its everyone, it\u2019s a community.\u201d In this, ENDEM believes that the beauty of Oceanwide isn\u2019t tangible. Rather, it lies in the birth of a new generation of graffiti writers. \u201cThey can erase the graffiti on buildings, but they can never erase the impact that it has on the city of Los Angeles and the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to it. Yes, it\u2019s vandalism. Yes, it\u2019s art, and it\u2019s everything in between,\u201d Gastman concluded. \u201cThis is a real culture. It\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/10/style/graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "world"}}

The Lakers\u00a0offered\u00a0the coach of\u00a0the reigning back-to-back NCAA champion Huskies a\u00a06-year, $70 million contract, according to ESPN, to fill the team\u2019s coaching vacancy. \u201cI am humbled by this entire experience. At the end of the day, I am extremely proud of the championship culture we have built at Connecticut,\u201d Hurley said in a statement emailed to CNN Monday. \u201cWe met as a team before today\u2019s workout and our focus right now is on getting better this summer and connecting as a team as we continue to pursue championships.\u201d ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski was the first to report the news. Hurley chose to stay at UConn so he can have an opportunity to chase winning a third straight NCAA championship, sources told Wojnarowski, and become the first men\u2019s program to accomplish the feat since UCLA won a seventh straight title in 1973. CNN has reached out to the Lakers for comment. Hurley led UConn to consecutive national titles and has an 141-58 record in six seasons. \u201cWe are thrilled that Dan Hurley has made the decision to stay at UConn and continue building upon our championship tradition,\u201d David Benedict, UConn athletic director, said in a\u00a0statement. \u201cHe has helped return our men\u2019s basketball program back to the pinnacle of the sport, including back-to-back NCAA Championships, and we\u2019re grateful for his loyalty to UConn. \u201cWe look forward to Dan\u2019s continued leadership on and off the court at UConn.

{"id": "world_africa_bananas-artificial-hair-cheverux-organique-spc", "text": "During a visit to a local farm while working with development agency USAID, Ugandan entrepreneur Juliet Tumusiime realized that a huge amount of banana stems are left over from banana cultivation and simply discarded. Looking for a way to use the waste, she struck upon an innovative business idea. Almost a decade later, now aged 42, Tumusiime is the chief executive and co-founder of Cheveux Organique, which manufactures hair made from banana fibers as an alternative to synthetic extensions. Fashion trends among the younger population and growing purchasing power have boosted the market for hair extensions and wigs in the Africa and the Middle East, which could be worth $710 million by 2028, according to Research and Markets. Extensions are typically made from human hair, or synthetic materials such as nylon, polyester, acrylic and PVC. Synthetics are popular in Uganda because they\u2019re much cheaper, but they\u2019re not biodegradable or easy to recycle. Some people complain that synthetic hair can irritate their scalp and a study of synthetic hair in Nigeria found the presence of potentially harmful heavy metals and chemicals. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to friends, colleagues, both men and women and asked them how they dispose of their hair when they take it out,\u201d Tumusiime says. \u201cA lot of the time it is just thrown in the trash. The level of awareness is really low - most people don\u2019t realize that they are wearing plastic on their head which can irritate the skin and cause pollution. \u201cOur mission is to transform the beauty industry by providing alternatives that benefit their health and the environment. We want to empower women to make informed decisions about what hair they use and what\u2019s best for them.\u201d Tumusiime says that, unlike synthetic hair, her product is biodegradable, durable and can be easily styled, treated and colored. It can also be rewashed with warm water and conditioned with detangling cream. When dry, the hypoallergenic hair can be oiled and can withstand dryers and heat up to 400 degrees, lasting weeks longer than synthetic alternatives, according to Tumusiime. Since it\u2019s made from discarded banana stems, she adds, it\u2019s also a way to help curb that waste. Uganda is Africa\u2019s largest producer and consumer of bananas, producing about 10 million metric tons of bananas per day. Ugandans consume almost one kilogram of the fruit per person, per day, with more than 75% of the population relying on bananas as a staple food, according to the World Economic Forum. Cheveux Organique works closely with local banana farmers, buying stems that would otherwise be discarded. The stems are split and the fibers extracted by machine. The extracted fibers are then dried and treated, before being combed out, resulting in the hair-like texture. The \u201chair\u201d is dyed into three shades: Cheveux Black, Cheveux Brown and Cheveux Blonde. Tumusiime says it has a natural sheen, is soft to the touch and can be used for braiding and styling. It\u2019s also suitable for warm and humid climates, she notes. The company isn\u2019t unique in creating plant-based hair. In the US, St.Louis-based Rebundle also sells hair extensions made from banana fibers, while Nourie Hair offers a hair alternative for braiding made from Ginseng root extract and rosemary. However, turning banana waste into a premium product does not come without challenges for Cheveux Organique. \u201cThe labor-intensive process, from picking the stems, transporting them to the facility, extracting the stems, treating them and the power needed to use this \u2013 it causes the product to become pricey,\u201d Tumusiime says. Cheveux Organique sells its plant-based hair in Uganda, and as fair afield as the US, France and the UK. It retails for $50 for 150 grams (5.3 ounces), which Tumusiime says is cheaper than a typical $185 for a similar amount of human hair. But synthetic hair can be bought for as little as $1 for a bundle. \u201cThis is something that we are hugely concerned about, and we are trying to find ways to mechanize the business and produce volumes of hair whilst continuing to break even,\u201d Tumusiime says. \u201cThe people paying these prices are getting a premium product at the end of it \u2013 and it\u2019s about the long-term benefits that this product brings.\u201d Tumusiime says her startup, which currently employs 25 permanent staff members and 100 part-time workers for waste gathering, is in the process of creating regional hubs, which will function as extraction centers, as well as an education point for young people. The hubs will train future generations on the positive impacts of waste management, as well as giving young people skillsets \u2013 such as extraction and machine operation \u2013 that will equip them for future careers. \u201cWe want to make sure that this brand is a household name,\u201d Tumusiime says. \u201cWe want to become leaders in this industry despite challenges. But I\u2019m passionate about what I\u2019m doing. I\u2019m not about to give up. I do everything possible to make sure that I achieve my objectives and achieve the vision for which I started this organization.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/world/africa/bananas-artificial-hair-cheverux-organique-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_10_tech_tesla-self-driving-cars-china-hnk-intl", "text": "Tesla is one step closer to launching full-self driving (FSD) technology in China after it clinched an agreement with Baidu to upgrade its mapping software. The Chinese tech giant said Saturday that it was providing lane-level navigation services for Tesla cars. Baidu (BIDU) says this level of navigation can provide drivers with detailed information, including making lane recommendations ahead of upcoming turns, to enhance safety. Experts said during Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk\u2019s surprise visit to China at the end of April that one of his main hurdles in securing government approval to rollout the company\u2019s FSD software was reaching a mapping and navigation deal with Baidu. \u201cWith the support of Baidu\u2019s lane-level map, Tesla\u2019s navigation can accurately render lane changes on the road the user is currently on, upgrading from providing road-level guidance to providing lane-level guidance,\u201d Baidu said in the statement. China\u2019s answer to Google has been been providing mapping services to Tesla since 2020. But prior to Saturday\u2019s announcement, its services had been limited to \u201croad-level\u201d information, which is less precise than lane-level navigation. A day earlier, Tesla launched its new software upgrade for users in urban areas in China, the world\u2019s biggest car market, saying in a statement on WeChat that such detailed road information was being made available \u201cfor the first time.\u201d CNN has reached out to Tesla for comment. On Monday, Baidu declined further comment. Virtually all Teslas have a driver-assistance system called Autopilot, while the more robust FSD feature comes at a premium price. Autopilot is available in China, but not the full FSD feature. Teaming up with Baidu would remove an obstacle, as the Chinese firm has key mapping credentials that can be applied to driver-assistance functions. According to Chinese regulations, all self-driving systems must obtain mapping qualifications before operating on public roads. Foreign car companies need to partner with licensed Chinese companies to qualify for surveying and mapping. Partnering with Baidu would allow Tesla to run its full self-driving system on China\u2019s public roads, with its vehicles able to collect surrounding data, such as road layout, traffic signs and buildings. It could also accelerate Tesla\u2019s global development of its self-driving technology, as data from China could be used to train Tesla\u2019s algorithms needed for fully autonomous vehicles. Car owners have long complained on social media about Tesla\u2019s previous navigation services, which were also provided by Baidu, saying they often have to rely on other maps available on smartphones while driving. \u201cThis time, you can really remove your mobile phone holders (mounted in the car),\u201d Tesla said in its Friday announcement, suggesting drivers no longer need other maps for navigation. The news went viral on Chinese social media on Monday. \u201cAfter the system upgrade, I no longer need to use my mobile phone to navigate,\u201d said one Weibo user. \u201cTesla\u2019s (own) navigation system can finally be used.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u201d Introducing the FSD system could provide a revenue boost to Tesla, which is having a tough time in China. In April, it slashed prices across its car product lines in the country, hoping to bolster sales in the face of slowing demand and increased competition.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/tech/tesla-self-driving-cars-china-hnk-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "world"}}

His ribs and collarbones are sticking out, his belly is sunken, his shoulder and hip joints clearly visible under his pale skin. Gorilyk\u2019s extreme emaciation appears to be the result of the two years he spent in Russian captivity. The former checkpoint guard at the Chernobyl nuclear plant in northern Ukraine was detained by Russian troops in March 2022, shortly after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

{"id": "2024_06_07_weather_heat-dome-wave-record-temperatures-southwest", "text": "A dangerous heat wave is expanding into new areas of the West and lingering in others Friday, bringing with it record-breaking temperatures and a serious risk of heat-related illness. The searing heat has already taken its toll. Since last weekend, multiple people in different parts of the US have died or have been hospitalized due to heat-related illnesses. The worst of the heat peaked Thursday for much of California and the Southwest, but unseasonably hot conditions will stick around in these areas and expand into the Pacific Northwest at least through the weekend. Heat alerts are in effect for more than 16 million people in California, Nevada, Arizona, Utah and New Mexico. Most will last through Friday but alerts in Las Vegas and Death Valley, California, last into Saturday. Several notable temperature records were broken Thursday in California, Arizona and Nevada. In California, a high of 122 degrees in Death Valley broke a daily record set in 1996. And in Fresno, a 121-year-old record was tied Thursday when the city maxed out at 107 degrees. Phoenix recorded its first high of 110 degrees or more this year when thermometers topped out at a daily record-setting 113 degrees Thursday. Las Vegas soared to 111 degrees Thursday, the earliest in the year the city has reached the mark, breaking the daily record of 110 degrees set in 2010. Several people across US have died from heat-related illnesses Six people believed to be migrants have died because of the heat in the past week along the US-Mexico border from southwestern Texas to New Mexico, according to US Border Patrol and the Sunland Park, New Mexico, fire department. Four people died \u201cfrom heat stroke and dehydration\u201d while triple-digit temperatures baked the area last weekend, the US Border Patrol, El Paso Sector said. Two more people were discovered in a desert area about six miles from the border in Sunland Park and were pronounced dead Wednesday, Sunland Park fire chief Daniel Medrano told CNN. Sunland Park is around 10 miles northwest of El Paso, Texas, along the New Mexico-Mexico border. Excessive heat is the leading weather related killer in the US, according to the National Weather Service. \u201cThis is especially true in the urban centers, where population density, the urban heat island, and building construction exacerbate the effects of excessive heat,\u201d the weather service says. \u201cA combination of high heat and humidity can lead to heat related illness, including heat cramps, heat exhaustion, and heat stroke.\u201d In the East, a 59-year-old man died of heat-related complications in Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland, officials said Wednesday. Additional details about the man\u2019s death, which was the state\u2019s first heat-related death of the year, were not released. Heat proved challenging for firefighters battling a blaze in California\u2019s Napa County Wednesday. Four firefighters were sent to area hospitals for injuries related to difficult terrain and \u201chot summer conditions,\u201d according to CAL Fire\u2019s Sonoma-Lake-Napa Unit. All four are expected to make full recoveries. Phoenix emergency responders on Thursday say they hospitalized 11 people due to heat exhaustion while they were attending a Donald Trump rally at the Dream City Church. With the risk of heat-related illnesses increasing for millions across the country, officials in several states are trying to keep residents safe during the smoldering heat. In California, cooling centers have been set up for those affected by triple-digit heat. As Texas contends with both severe storms and excessive heat, a state disaster declaration remains active. Hazardous heat expected into weekend Heat will continue through the weekend before easing off a bit early next week. However, many typically hot areas in the West will still have to contend with temperatures up to 10 degrees above normal and warm nighttime lows will make it difficult for those vulnerable to extreme conditions to be able to cool off. The Las Vegas metro area is at \u201cextreme\u201d risk from the heat through Saturday, according to a scale from the National Weather Service that gauges heat\u2019s potential impact on people\u2019s health. The highest level on the heat risk scale means residents without enough cooling and hydration will be impacted, and \u201cimpacts are likely in most health systems, heat-sensitive industries and infrastructure.\u201d Several more large metro areas in Arizona, California, New Mexico and Texas will face a \u201cmajor\u201d Level 3 of 4 heat risk. Summerlike heat will expand north and east Friday and reach the Northwest and parts of the Rockies. Records could be broken in parts of Oregon, Washington and Idaho from Friday through the weekend.

{"id": "2024_06_10_weather_summer-forecast-disasters-fema-climate", "text": "The United States has been rocked by an extraordinary number of tornadoes and devastating storms this year that have already left a staggering price tag. Now heading into what forecasters say will be an extreme summer \u2013 from punishing heat waves to severe weather and hurricanes \u2013 the nation\u2019s disaster relief agency is expected to run out of money before it\u2019s even over. The US has been thrashed with 11 extreme weather disasters with costs exceeding $1 billion so far this year, with a total price tag of $25.1 billion, according to an updated tally from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. It\u2019s tied for the second-most such disasters on record and doesn\u2019t even include the extreme weather in the second half of May, said\u00a0Adam Smith, an applied climatologist with NOAA. That is worrying news for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, whose major disaster relief fund could slip into the red by the end of summer \u2013 a more than $1.3 billion shortfall in August, according to a May report. Florida\u2019s two Republican senators recently wrote a letter to FEMA asking the agency how much more money it would need to respond to hurricane season. In a statement to CNN, a FEMA spokesperson didn\u2019t address exactly how much funding it would need to get through hurricane season, but said the agency is continuing to work with Congress \u201cto ensure sufficient funding is available\ufeff.\u201d \u201cWithout additional funding, FEMA will take steps prior to funding exhaustion to ensure resources are available to support ongoing lifesaving and life sustaining activities,\u201d the spokesperson said. In the event of a major catastrophe like a hurricane, the agency would have a funding reserve set aside for initial response and recovery operations. FEMA\u2019s tenuous balance sheet reflects how many destructive storms have already lashed the US. This spring produced the second-most tornadoes to-date since records began in 1950, according to the Storm Prediction Center. Tornado activity skyrocketed from late April through May, with more than 780 confirmed tornadoes cutting across the central and eastern US during April and May, the SPC said. Some storms have been deadly. An EF4 that ripped through Greenfield, Iowa, killed five. Another tornado in Cooke County, Texas, later in the month killed seven people. Severe thunderstorms have been extremely destructive, with hail wreaking havoc across the central US.\u00a0Severe thunderstorms blasted multiple cities with hurricane-force wind gusts in May. A derecho with 100 mph wind turned debris into projectiles and shattered glass windows in downtown Houston skyscrapers. Nearly a million homes and businesses were left without power, many for days, after violent winds mangled massive electrical transmission towers. And scientists are warning this summer could continue the destruction as the dramatic warming of the planet and oceans from burning fossil fuels set the stage for a supercharged hurricane season and dangerous heat. The climate crisis\u2019 favorite season Summer historically is the season with the most billion-dollar disasters because it is \u201ca transition period of many extremes historically, as the severe storm season continues while the prospect of hurricane season approaches,\u201d Smith said. A chorus of expert voices are calling for an above-average Atlantic hurricane season as anxiety-inducing conditions in the atmosphere and oceans align. Record-breaking ocean heat is expected to\u00a0feed hurricanes, helping them form, strengthen and survive. El Ni\u00f1o is predicted to give way to La Ni\u00f1a and create more favorable atmospheric conditions for storms to thrive. Just about every kind of extreme weather is possible during summer, including more severe thunderstorms. June is the third-most active month for tornadoes in the US, according to the SPC. It\u2019s also the most-active month for destructive and costly severe hail, a 2012 study found. While the connection between hurricanes and climate change is strong, scientists are less sure whether there\u2019s a link to stronger or more frequent tornadoes but are sure it is making heat waves more intense and frequent. Above-average temperatures are expected over nearly every square mile of the Lower 48 this summer, and it began early: It\u2019s already been the hottest start to June on record in Las Vegas, as the West gets hit with a series of early-season heat waves. Prolonged, intense heat dries out soil and can lead to\u00a0drought and billions of dollars in costs due to crop losses. Last year, a series of heat domes seared the South and produced the worst drought on record for Louisiana and one of the state\u2019s worst fire seasons on record. Heat can dry out grass and create a tinderbox for fast-moving wildfires, particularly in the central and western US. California\u2019s fire season could get a late start because of another exceptional wet season, according to Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles. But as heat takes its toll, wildfire activity could \u201creally amp up\u201d in California in late summer as the bounty of grass and brush from the wet season dries out, Swain said. He also highlighted the Great Basin in Nevada and Utah as a spot that normally doesn\u2019t see wildfire but could, due to a \u201chuge proliferation of grass.\u201d According to Swain, wildfire activity could really kick off in late summer, and if that holds up, emergency response could stretch well into the fall. It\u2019s shaping up to be another year of year-round extreme weather.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/weather/summer-forecast-disasters-fema-climate/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_08_americas_edmundo-gonzalez-venezuela-profile-intl-latam", "text": "Restraint is a rare quality for a politician, especially in Venezuela, a country whose recent leaders have been synonymous with vitriolic populism. Hugo Chavez, the late president who still casts a formidable shadow across the country more than ten years after his death, used to speak for hours on his television show,\u00a0Hello President!, while his firebrand successor, incumbent President Nicolas Maduro, is equally capable of clocking 60-plus minutes of uninterrupted oratory when the mood takes him. So it\u2019s telling that the man tasked with challenging Maduro in Venezuela\u2019s presidential election next month is a man of few words. Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia, the official candidate of a large opposition coalition known as the Democratic Unitary Platform, has a habit of answering his questions in single sentences, often stopping before the interviewer has the time to think of a follow-up. It\u2019s an unexpected approach from a presidential candidate aiming to drum up voter enthusiasm in order to take on an authoritarian leader who in the last ten years has dug into power by allegedly rigging elections and\u00a0violating human rights. But Gonzalez is not your typical Venezuelan politician. After decades in the foreign service (he was an ambassador to Algeria and Argentina) and then as a back bench manager for Venezuela\u2019s opposition, Gonzalez was only selected as a coalition candidate because two other opposition leaders \u2013 Maria Corina Machado and Corina Yoris \u2013 had been barred from running and a deadline was looming. \u201cI never imagined I would find myself in this situation,\u201d he told Venezuelan media in late April, shortly after his candidature was formalized. Yet since then, his poise and calm have helped him build a comfortable lead against Maduro, according to recent polls. Opposition, a dangerous business Challenging Maduro\u2019s near total grip on power can be a dangerous business. Over the years, he has jailed or exiled dozens of opposition leaders, some of them for years. And hundreds of people have been killed in political violence in Venezuela in the past decade, often at the hands of state security forces. But most analysts agree Gonzalez represents the best chance that Venezuela\u2019s political opposition has had to dislodge Maduro from power since 2013. His name is already on the ballot for the July 28 presidential vote, and the government has so far shown little appetite for going after him. In October, the Maduro government and the opposition, along with representatives from the United States, signed a comprehensive agreement in Barbados where Maduro pledged to hold free and fair elections in exchange for sanctions relief from Washington. Since then, there have been mixed signals on both sides about the extent of the deal: US-imposed oil sanctions have only partially been lifted and most of Maduro\u2019s close circle is still subject to individual sanctions, while on May 28, Caracas withdrew an invitation for the European Union to send electoral observers to monitor the upcoming vote. Gonzalez claims he\u2019s not worried about possible persecution, telling CNN En Espa\u00f1ol that he is \u201cvery calm, confident although aware of the enormous challenge\u201d the opposition is up against. Asked about the prospect of a repeat of the 2018 election, which Maduro won amid widespread allegations of vote-rigging and a boycott by the opposition, Gonzalez says he hopes pressure from other countries will force Maduro\u2019s hand. Most experts say the international community is unlikely to intervene in Venezuela again after the debacle of the 2019 opposition uprising led by Juan Guaido, the then-opposition leader who swore himself in as interim president and was recognized by more than fifty countries \u2013 only for Maduro to retain power and ride out the storm unscathed. But Gonzalez seems buoyant nonetheless. \u201cFraud, vote rigging, and threats are nothing new for us,\u201d Gonzalez told CNN En Espa\u00f1ol, \u201cBut we\u2019re confident that on the day the opposition vote will be so massive our victory will be indisputable.\u201d His family is not so tranquil. \u201cWe are worried, no doubt,\u201d Gonzalez\u2019s daughter Mariana told CNN. \u201cBut we\u2019re trying to live one day at a time, because if we start thinking of what could happen, this or that, we stop moving,\u201d she said. The biggest question But how to convince an authoritarian government entrenched in power for decades to voluntarily give up control and lead a democratic transition? Gonzalez has never offered an answer to the question that hangs the July vote. Instead of detailing a roadmap to democracy, he has only hinted at what steps he would take should he win in July and the electoral authority effectively certify the result. He said his biggest priorities would be\u00a0taming\u00a0inflation, another of Venezuela\u2019s chronic ills\u00a0and\u00a0currently running at 64% year on year, and restoring trust in\u00a0the\u00a0institutions of power\u00a0such as the judiciary, currently stacked by Maduro\u2019s sympathizers. The fate of the incumbent and his closest allies \u2013 several of whom are under investigation in the Hague for crimes against humanity \u2013 remain in the balance. But amnesty for outgoing officials could be on the table, Gonzalez told CNN en Espa\u00f1ol. \u201cIn all political transitions and political crises, you have amnesty agreements and transitional justice. All the countries who have gone through situations like ours have ended up granting it, so I don\u2019t rule out we could take a similar measure in Venezuela,\u201d he said. While the election is slated for late July, Venezuela law mandates that the winning candidate won\u2019t take office before January 2025 \u2013 creating a delicate 6-month handover period that Gonzalez would have to manage carefully if he wins. \u201cThose six months will be key for him as a president-elect, while the entire state apparatus remains under the control of the regime,\u201d said Sadio Garavini di Tullio, a classmate of Gonzalez who also served in the foreign office and helped manage the opposition in the Chavez years. \u201cEdmundo however can be that person; he can give a lot of guarantees to everyone involved with the regime.\u201d \u201cHe will not be the president of the opposition government, he\u2019ll be the president of the transition government,\u201d Garavini di Tullio said. George Eickhoff, a German diplomat who served as director of the Konrad Adenauer Foundation in Caracas between 2008 and 2013 and remains close to Gonzalez, made a similar point. \u201cEdmundo is a public servant, he knows there cannot be any revenge [against the government],\u201d Eickhoff told CNN. \u201cHe has already started to speak to the other side: for the opposition, Machado is the firebrand messenger to galvanize its base, while Edmundo is an extension of the soft message, he\u2019s very realistic about his task.\u201d Asked about the possibility of vote-rigging by the Maduro regime, Gonzalez was sanguine. \u201cWe\u2019re aware we\u2019re facing an enemy,\u201d he began \u2013 then corrected himself, softening the message: \u201cAn adversary that has no qualms about using any advantage the system gives them.\u201d Grandfather figure The dual message has been visible throughout this first month of the political campaigning period, with Machado, a long-time conservative politician who first ran for president in 2012, holding public rallies in every street, while Gonzalez has dispensed calmness from his home in Caracas. When Gonzalez\u2019s candidature was formalized in April, a portrait of him by Bloomberg photographer Gaby Oraa went viral in Venezuela. It shows the candidate feeding four colorful tropical parrots called\u00a0guacamayas, typical of Caracas. Across the city, citizens routinely feed these wild birds who can display a pet-like loyalty. \u201cThey come every day, two, three, four\u2026 sometimes even ten. They are his friends,\u201d said Mariana, Gonzalez\u2019s daughter. \u201cThe\u00a0guacamayas\u00a0come in the morning and in the evening, he can spend hours just feeding them sunflower seeds. He takes care of them.\u201d His other passions, according to those who know him well, are baseball, the Real Madrid football club, family barbecues, and reading. Fans see in him a grandfather-of-the-nation type figure who could usher in a new era after the political violence of the last decade, pointing to his electoral slogan \u201cEdmundo, president for all\u201d, as well as his age (73) and family situation (he has four grandchildren). Two of those grandchildren now live in Spain, among the more than seven million Venezuelans who have fled the country in recent years.

{"id": "2024_05_02_style_aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl", "text": "Miami has a new addition to its skyline \u2013 a 66-story residential tower built by Aston Martin, marking the British luxury sports carmaker\u2019s first foray into the residential real estate market. Comprising of 391 units, Aston Martin Residences Miami sits at the mouth of the Miami River on Biscayne Bay, the firm said in a statement Tuesday. Designed in partnership with architect Rodolfo Miani of Bodas Mian Anger and built by G&G Business Developments, the 249-meter- (818-foot-) tall building houses seven penthouses, each with private pools and terraces, as well as apartments ranging in size from one to five bedrooms. The largest unit is the \u201cUnique Triplex Penthouse,\u201d arranged over three floors at the top of the building, which remains on the market for $59 million. The property was officially opened on Tuesday. Timed to coincide with the Formula One Miami Grand Prix, the company said in a statement that it marks \u201cthe latest distinct expression of Aston Martin\u2019s ultra-luxury high performance brand.\u201d Featuring an infinity pool with a pool deck, jacuzzis and cabanas on the 55th floor, the sail-shaped complex has a two-floor fitness center, two movie theaters and a virtual golf simulator. The building has a sky bar and lounge, chef\u2019s kitchen, ballroom and private dining areas, as well as a spa, beauty salon and barber shop. Direct access to the sea via a superyacht marina is also available, plus a private butler service. Germ\u00e1n Coto, chief executive officer of G&G Business Developments, told CNN Tuesday that the firm wanted to work on a project in the \u201ccosmopolitan city\u201d of Miami, and that this piece of land was the perfect choice. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing plot with an excellent view of the river,\u201d said Coto. The structure\u2019s aerodynamic shape helps the building deal with the technical challenges presented by high winds in the area, as well as evoking the sleek shape of an Aston Martin, according to Marek Reichman, executive vice president and chief creative officer of Aston Martin. It also becomes wider from the base to the mid-section before tightening once more towards the top, making it appear to bow out over people on street level, Reichman told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the drama,\u201d he added. Challenges However, the process wasn\u2019t all plain sailing. \u201cIt was difficult to achieve what we wanted because the space and the plot is kind of small,\u201d said Coto, with the building fitting into a 1.25-acre plot of land. Meanwhile, local building regulations imposed strict standards, explained Reichman, taking into account the low-lying land and propensity for flooding. \u201cThey were some of the most amazing challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to withstand the flooding with the windows that are on street level.\u201d There were further obstacles due to the curved shape of the building, which means that units on the east side have an individual architectural structural component. Aston Martin touches Homeowners are able to customize their interior space with the help of the Aston Martin design team, with three style packages \u2013 Timeless, Covert and Indulgent \u2013 drawing on the company\u2019s British heritage, as well as the building\u2019s context. \u201cIt needs to have part of the DNA of an Aston Martin,\u201d Reichman said. \u201cBut we are in Miami, you don\u2019t have a cold November evening where you need to put the log fire on, so you\u2019ve got to be considerate of the environment that you\u2019re in.\u201d Design elements running through the building include doors with bespoke Aston Martin handles, number plinths and kestrel tan leather door tabs. Aston Martin said that 99% of the properties sold before the building was completed. Residences were sold for $1.5 million to $8.5 million, while penthouses ranged from $16 million to $59 million. The Unique Triplex Penthouse, on the market for $59 million, comes with the last remaining Aston Martin Vulcan, an 820 brake horsepower all-carbon fiber supercar, of which only 24 exist, a spokesman for the company said. Meanwhile, buyers of the 47 Signature and Penthouse units were also able to choose between an Aston Martin DBX sports SUV or the company\u2019s DB11 sportscar. Aston Martin isn\u2019t the first luxury carmaker to enter the residential property market. A 63-story building from Bentley will open in 2026 along the coastline of Sunny Isles Beach, Florida. Featuring 216 units, the property will have an elevator designed to take residents up to their doorstep while seated inside their cars.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/02/style/aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_06_europe_european-parliament-elections-2024-explained-intl", "text": "One of the world\u2019s largest democratic exercises is underway, with some 373 million people across the European Union eligible to vote in elections for the next European Parliament. Voters in the 27 nations of the EU head to the polls from Thursday to Sunday to elect 720 members of the parliament, which will play a crucial role in shaping the priorities and political direction of the bloc for the next five years. The vote comes at a pivotal moment for the EU, which is grappling with issues ranging from the wars in Ukraine and Gaza to immigration and climate change. Polls have predicted big gains for hard-right parties in a number of countries, which could have long-term implications for the continent. Here\u2019s what you need to know about the world\u2019s biggest multi-country election. How do the elections work? The elections are held over four days every five years in June. This year, they are taking place between\u00a0June\u00a06\u00a0and\u00a09. They are held over multiple days because, despite being elections to an EU institution, they are still arranged and managed as national\u00a0ballots\u00a0by each of the EU\u2019s 27 member states.  In some countries, they may all be\u00a0held\u00a0on a single day, whereas others take place over several days. Because the elections are managed at a national level, they are not all carried out in the same exact way. However, they must all employ a proportional representation system\u00a0\u2013where the number of lawmakers\u00a0elected\u00a0to the parliament directly correlates to the percentage of people who voted for them. Once all the votes have been counted, each national political party will be assigned a number of\u00a0members of European Parliament (MEPs)\u00a0relative to their vote share. It is up to the member states to determine how this is assigned. Once they have been appointed to the parliament, MEPs can then join a European political party, which allows them to sit in a group in the parliament. These parties and groupings are multinational and based on a loose set of shared beliefs.\u00a0The bigger the grouping, the more influence it has in parliament. Results will start to come in late on Sunday, but full results will not be known until at least Monday. What\u2019s the point of the European Parliament and what do MEPs do? The European Parliament sits primarily in Brussels, Belgium, but moves roughly once a month to Strasbourg, France. It is the legislative branch of the EU and one of the bloc\u2019s three main institutions \u2013 along with the European Commission, which is the executive branch, and the European Council, which is made up of ministers from the governments of the 27 member states. It is the only EU institution where\u00a0representatives\u00a0are directly elected,\u00a0and MEPs pass laws which are applied all over the bloc. In order for any legislation to be implemented, both the council and parliament have to agree. One of the parliament\u2019s most crucial roles is approving the makeup of the commission, which is ultimately responsible for the political direction of the world\u2019s largest trading bloc, and it has the final say on who is appointed as president of the commission. Currently the top job is filled by Germany\u2019s Ursula von der Leyen, who is seeking a second term at the helm. The parliament also has\u00a0ultimate approval\u00a0over\u00a0the billions of euros allocated in the EU budget. It often has the final\u00a0word\u00a0on major policy issues\u00a0such as\u00a0the budget, trade\u00a0and\u00a0sanctions on foreign nationals. The parliament can also put major international objectives in the deep freeze. For example, A comprehensive mutual investment agreement between the EU and China is effectively on hold while some MEPs are under sanctions from China. The parliament as a whole has refused to advance the agreement until the sanctions are lifted. What are the biggest issues in this vote? Since this week\u2019s election is in effect 27 individual national elections, some\u00a0issues are in play in some countries but not in others. Broadly speaking, immigration, climate change, security and support for Ukraine are issues that matter across the bloc. While\u00a0irregular\u00a0migration figures are lower than they were\u00a0during\u00a0the 2015-2016\u00a0refugee\u00a0crisis, it is still a sensitive issue across the EU, as some countries\u00a0bear a disproportionate share of\u00a0the burden\u00a0while\u00a0others are loathe to\u00a0do their part. Slowing the effects of climate change and making Europe greener has been a priority for a long time. However, some countries now balk at the cost of\u00a0cutting fossil fuel emissions. The EU is largely united on its support for Ukraine, but that too could be affected if populists like\u00a0France\u2019s Marine\u00a0Le Pen are elected\u00a0to lead national governments. What are the political groupings? If the\u00a0720 MEPs representing 27 countries and hundreds of different domestic political parties\u00a0were all left to their own devices, things would\u00a0get very complicated. To simplify the work of the parliament, leaders of national governments form alliances with each other based on their shared political beliefs \u2013 the European political parties. If\u00a0a politician is\u00a0a member of, for example, French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s Renaissance party in France,\u00a0he or she\u00a0will stand for that party as an MEP at a national level. If\u00a0they\u00a0are then elected to the European Parliament,\u00a0they\u00a0will join the centrist, liberal European party, Renew Europe \u2013\u00a0which currently has members from 24 of the 27 EU members. Once\u00a0seated\u00a0in parliament,\u00a0they\u00a0will sit alongside the other MEPs from Renew parties in other countries as a political grouping. There are seven main groupings, ranging from the extremes of the far right to the far left. The two dominant groupings are the center-right conservative European People\u2019s Party (EPP) and the center-left\u00a0Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D). Due to proportional representation, no single group has anything resembling a majority and therefore\u00a0they\u00a0must form broad coalitions\u00a0to get anything done in parliament. The EPP and S&D (or their previous incarnations) have dominated this coalition\u00a0for decades. While these two parties are still expected to be the largest after the elections, all eyes are on the other main right-wing groups,\u00a0the\u00a0European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) and the hard-right, populist Identity and Democracy (ID). What\u2019s likely to happen in the election? It is expected that the EPP and S&D centrist coalition will largely hold. However, it is also expected that ECR and ID will make significant gains that result\u00a0in more power in the next parliament. The two hard-right parties have not said they will work together and the leaderships of the two groups are known to dislike each other. Giorgia Meloni, the Italian prime minister and president of the ECR\u00a0bloc, has an eye on working with the mainstream right at an EU level, for instance. During\u00a0the\u00a02022 Italian\u00a0general\u00a0election, much was made of Meloni\u2019s right-wing rhetoric. She was a hardliner on immigration,\u00a0and\u00a0had\u00a0questioned LGBTQ+ rights, among other things. However, since winning she has been pragmatic in working with\u00a0those in power\u00a0at a European level \u2013 most notably\u00a0von der Leyen, the commission\u2019s president, who is herself a member of the more mainstream EPP. Von der Leyen even went so far as\u00a0to visit\u00a0the Italian island of Lampedusa, which has\u00a0been\u00a0an arrival point for\u00a0large numbers of irregular\u00a0migrants, to set out a\u00a010-point EU plan\u00a0to support Italy with the influx. Critics say that\u00a0Meloni\u00a0has sold out; supporters say that she has played her cards perfectly and managed to pull the EU\u2019s center in her direction.\u00a0Evidence of this might be the EU\u00a0having\u00a0finally\u00a0agreed a deal\u00a0earlier\u00a0this year\u00a0on how it would share the\u00a0weight\u00a0of irregular migration, after years of deadlock and negotiation. How could the election affect European politics? The\u00a0possibility\u00a0that the EU\u2019s political center might be up for grabs\u00a0is the most important context of these elections. The opaque and fluid nature of politics at a European level means that a lot can change over the course of a five-year period. Between the EPP and S&D, there might be a centrist coalition on day one of this\u00a0new\u00a0parliament. But these are not formal coalitions, rather loose alliances that vote together, issue by issue. This is where the idea of a\u00a0right-wing\u00a0ECR and ID axis becomes significant. The rise of the far-right\u2019s influence in European Parliament follows a similar trend at the national level in a number of major EU member states. National\u00a0elections\u00a0are\u00a0set to take place in France in 2027,\u00a0in which\u00a0right-wing populist\u00a0Le Pen could emerge victorious. She is the chair of ID and has recently made obvious efforts to detoxify the\u00a0bloc\u00a0by expelling\u00a0lawmakers from\u00a0the far-right Alternative for Germany\u00a0(AfD)\u00a0from\u00a0its ranks\u00a0following accusations of antisemitism.\u00a0 A\u00a0victory in the French presidential election would\u00a0of course\u00a0make Le Pen a much bigger major player in European politics. That might not mean any formal coalition between the center-right EPP and ID, but the politics of the European Parliament is a sliding scale of sorts and, if France shifts right, it\u2019s fair to say the center-right will take note. There are EPP members (and certainly ECR members) who will agree with ID members on\u00a0matters\u00a0such as\u00a0immigration and climate change. When those issues come up and the parliament has a role to play, it\u2019s not implausible that\u00a0the\u00a0ECR and ID could\u00a0then put\u00a0huge pressure on EPP lawmakers to vote the same way. It is, after all, always worth remembering that these people must still answer to their domestic voters, who can sack them at the next election.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/europe/european-parliament-elections-2024-explained-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_06_07_style_nicola-coughlan-bridgerton-lotw", "text": "(CNN) \u2014 \u201cBridgerton\u201d fans haven\u2019t been able to stop talking about that long-awaited carriage scene that closed out the first half of the hit Regency-era romance series\u2019 third season on Netflix. And now, as stars Nicola Coughlan and Luke Newton, who play love interests Penelope Featherington and Colin Bridgerton (Polin, to the shippers), promote the remaining episodes, Coughlan is pulling out all the sartorial stops to match the romance of the season. At the Toronto red-carpet premiere earlier this week, Coughlan stepped out in a structured lavender mini dress rippling with petal-like silk organza, paired with a voluminous red gathered cloak fit for early 19th-century yearning. The couture ensemble is by designer Sara Mrad and served as another example of Coughlan\u2019s stylist, Aim\u00e9e Croysdill, playing up the Irish actress\u2019s curves with exaggerated silhouettes. Coughlan has long been admired for her bold red-carpet looks \u2014 including her debut at the Met Gala in 2022 in an extravagant pink and black Richard Quinn ball gown \u2014 but she\u2019s amplified her style on her \u201cBridgerton\u201d press tour. In April, she glimmered at a London event in a sculptural 22-karat gold-plated corset by MISHO that featured an anatomical heart. Last month, she wore a dramatic white peplum hourglass gown by Danielle Frankel to the New York premiere. (Nearly all her looks have also been accessorized with a red pin that signals her support for a ceasefire in Palestine, too). This season has been a milestone for her character Penelope, who takes the spotlight at court, and Coughlan. As the former \u201cDerry Girls\u201d actor has stepped into the role of leading lady, she\u2019s intentional about how she wants to be portrayed. \u201cThere\u2019s one scene where I\u2019m very naked on camera, and that was my idea, my choice. It just felt like the biggest \u2018f*** you\u2019 to all the conversation surrounding my body; it was amazingly empowering,\u201d she told Stylist magazine earlier this year, which was reported on by BuzzFeed. And though Coughlan\u2019s power dressing can speak for itself, the actor has been candid with her fans about what\u2019s appropriate and what isn\u2019t, writing on Instagram earlier this year that \u201cit\u2019s really hard to take the weight of thousands of opinions on how you look being sent directly to you every day.\u201d But she\u2019s also responded with wit that rivals Penelope\u2019s. At the Dublin premiere, she was asked about her \u201cbravery\u201d in showing her body on screen. She replied: \u201cYou know it is hard because I think women with my body type \u2013\u2014 women with perfect breasts \u2014 don\u2019t get to see ourselves on screen enough.\u201d \u201cI hope you enjoy them,\u201d she added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/style/nicola-coughlan-bridgerton-lotw/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_10_asia_north-korea-trash-balloons-south-korea-loudspeakers-intl-hnk", "text": "North Korea sent a new wave of trash-laden balloons toward its southern neighbor late Sunday, after Kim Jong Un\u2019s powerful sister warned of further responses if the South keeps up its \u201cpsychological warfare.\u201d The new balloons, which Seoul has previously slammed as \u201cbase and dangerous,\u201d come in apparent retaliation for the decision by South Korea to resume broadcasting anti-North Korean\u00a0propaganda over loudspeakers in border areas. Kim\u2019s sister and government spokeswoman Kim Yo Jong warned the resumption of loudspeaker broadcasts was \u201ca prelude to a very dangerous situation.\u201d In a statement carried by North Korean state media, Kim said South Korea would be subject to an unspecified \u201cnew counteraction\u201d\u00a0from the North if it continued with the loudspeaker broadcasts and failed to prevent activists from\u00a0sending anti-North Korean propaganda leaflets over the border. \u201cI sternly warn Seoul to stop at once this dangerous act,\u201d Kim said, adding that Seoul is creating a \u201cnew environment of crisis.\u201d South\u00a0Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS)\u00a0has maintained North\u00a0Korea\u00a0is \u201cfully responsible\u201d for the current situation and urged the North to \u201cimmediately stop such mean acts like sending waste balloons.\u201d In a statement Monday, a JCS spokesman would not say whether the South would continue to broadcast over the loudspeakers, noting only that\u00a0the military would conduct missions \u201cwith flexibility according to the strategic and operational situation.\u201d The escalating tit-for-tat has sparked concerns of potential retaliatory military action. Last week, the South Korean government suspended a 2018 deal\u00a0to reduce military tensions with the North, allowing it to resume propaganda broadcasts and potentially restart military exercises along the border. South Korea\u2019s military once routinely deployed propaganda broadcasts as a means of psychological warfare against the North, until it withdrew the equipment following the 2018 deal. The broadcasts inform North\u00a0Korean soldiers and residents of the \u201creality of North\u00a0Korea,\u201d and the development of\u00a0South\u00a0Korea, and modern Korean culture, according to the JCS. Tit-for-tat balloons In recent weeks, the North has floated more than a thousand trash-filled balloons across the heavily fortified border, in what it claims is a response to the years-long practice among South Korean activist groups of sending\u00a0balloons with anti-North Korea leaflets in the other direction. As of Monday morning, the South Korean military had found \u201caround 50 balloons\u201d that fell into its territory overnight Sunday. Many other balloons are believed to have flown back into\u00a0North\u00a0Korea due to the wind, according to the JCS spokesman. On Thursday, South Korean activists sent balloons across the border toward the North, carrying hundreds of thousands of leaflets condemning leader Kim Jong Un and 5,000 USB sticks containing K-pop and K-dramas. For decades, North Korea has been almost completely closed off from the rest of the world, with tight control over what information gets in or out. Foreign materials including movies and books are banned, with only a few state-sanctioned exceptions; those caught with foreign contraband often face severe punishment, defectors say. Earlier this year a South Korean research group released rare footage that it claimed showed North Korean teenagers\u00a0sentenced to hard labor\u00a0for watching and distributing K-dramas. Restrictions softened somewhat in recent decades as North Korea\u2019s relationship with China expanded. Tentative steps to open up allowed some South Korean elements, including\u00a0parts of its pop culture,\u00a0to seep into the hermit nation \u2013 especially in 2017 and 2018, when relations thawed between the two countries. But the situation in North Korea deteriorated in the following years and diplomatic talks fell apart \u2013 prompting\u00a0strict rules to snap back\u00a0into place in the North.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/asia/north-korea-trash-balloons-south-korea-loudspeakers-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_09_middleeast_israel-hostage-rescue-gaza-intl-hnk", "text": "Four hostages have been rescued in an Israeli operation that took weeks of planning \u2013 but killed scores of Palestinians in Gaza and left behind a trail of devastation. At least 274 Palestinians were killed in the operation and hundreds injured, Gazan authorities said, who do not distinguish between civilian and military casualties. While there has been euphoria for the families of the four rescued \u2013 Noa Argamani, Almog Meir Jan, Andrey Kozlov, and Shlomi Ziv, eight months after they were kidnapped from the Nova music festival on October 7 - celebrations could be brief. Israel\u2019s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu remains under intense pressure, with his goal of destroying Hamas and rescuing the remaining hostages still distant. He has refused to sign up to the latest peace plan, presented by US President Joe Biden last week, and the toll among Palestinians continues to rise. Here\u2019s what we know about Saturday\u2019s operation. What happened in the raid? Unusually, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) opted for a daytime raid on the Nuseirat camp in central Gaza on Saturday - saying that it allowed them a greater element of surprise. As part of their preparations, the military built models of the apartments the hostages were held in after receiving intelligence regarding their location. \u201cIsraeli forces have been preparing for this rescue mission for weeks. They underwent intensive training,\u201d Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari told a press briefing. Hagari said Israeli forces had to enter civilian areas to reach hostages as this was where Hamas had embedded itself. Some of the special forces were disguised as displaced Palestinians and as members of Hamas\u2019s military wing, according a witness as well as reporting from CNN analyst Barak Ravid, citing eyewitnesses in the refugee camp. CNN has\u00a0reached out to the IDF for comment. Without the cover of darkness, the IDF ran a greater risk of failing to get in and out of Gaza safely. One officer was shot and killed during the operation, according to Israeli police. Hagari said the IDF had received intelligence on the location of the hostages beforehand, noting that hostages in Gaza were frequently moved around and Argamani had previously been held elsewhere. Similar raids had been called off at the last minute \u201cmore than three or four times\u201d due to unfavorable conditions, he added. The first phase of Saturday\u2019s operation saw the IDF target militant infrastructure with pre-planned strikes, Hagari said. Hagari said that the IDF had come under intense fire, especially after withdrawing from the apartments, but did not provide evidence for his claims. \u201cWhile under fire, under fire inside the buildings, under fire on the way out from Gaza, our forces rescued our hostages,\u201d he said. Ravid, the CNN analyst, also reported there was a \u201crobust firefight\u201d after the hostages were rescued. Why was the Palestinian toll so high? The raid took place mid-morning, meaning the streets were teeming with people shopping at a nearby market. The hostages were held in civilian buildings, according to the IDF, in the midst of the densely populated camp. Hagari said the hostages had been locked in two separate apartments in multi-story buildings about 200 meters (650 feet) apart, with Argamani held in a different building to the three men. There were early indications of an ongoing mission when Israel announced ahead of the news on Saturday morning it was operating in Nuseirat, but it had launched a new offensive in the area midweek. Heavy bombardment was reported during the Israeli rescue mission. There are varying reports on the number of Palestinians killed. The latest figures from Gazan authorities say 274 Palestinians were killed and 698 injured \u2013 which would mark one of the deadliest days in months for people living in Gaza. The IDF has disputed those numbers, saying it estimated the number of casualties from the operation was \u201cunder 100.\u201d CNN cannot independently verify either side\u2019s figures. But local residents described the attack as a \u201chell on earth,\u201d with scenes of carnage following the strikes that led up to the rescue. Eyewitnesses have described civilians being struck down by airstrikes and shrapnel. One local Palestinian\u00a0man named Abu Abdallah told a CNN stringer on the ground that people were struck in their homes at around 5am local time. \u201cWe tried to get ambulances, but no\u00a0one could enter as it was already a military zone,\u201d he said. \u201cDogs were eating people\u2019s remains, we pulled out six martyrs, all torn up children and women, we risked our lives to get them to the hospital. The soldiers told us to go back but we had to continue,\u201d he added. Another local resident, Nidal Abdo, said he was shopping at\u00a0Nuseirat\u00a0market before \u201ca crazy bombardment started hitting everywhere.\u201d \u201c[It was] something we never witnessed before, maybe 150 rockets fell in less than 10 minutes, while we were running away more fell\u00a0on\u00a0the market,\u201d he said. Footage from\u00a0Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, in nearby Deir al-Balah, shows trucks and ambulances transferring injured people and bodies to the hospital. The hospital\u2019s emergency room is overwhelmed. People can be seen in the footage waiting\u00a0on\u00a0the hospital floor. Graphic video shows many Palestinians, including children, injured with blood on their faces and clothes. Footage from the hospital\u00a0also shows people screaming and crying, huddled over bodies covered in blankets. What\u2019s the reaction been? Families of the hostages expressed their overwhelming joy at having their loved ones returned safely. Orit Meir, mother\u00a0of\u00a0Almog Meir Jan, said at a news conference Saturday that she was excited to hug her son again. \u201cI couldn\u2019t stop hugging him,\u201d she said. \u201cTomorrow is my birthday so I got my present.\u201d Argamani was reunited with her terminally ill mother, who suffers from Stage 4 cancer. Netanyahu - who met with the rescued hostages and their families at Sheba Hospital on Saturday - called the operation \u201cheroic,\u201d adding that the government would continue \u201cto do everything we can\u201d to recover all those being held in the enclave. The operation was \u201ca great light in the terrible\u00a0darkness,\u201d Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid said Saturday. Avi Marciano, father of Corporal Noa Marciano, a 19-year-old hostage who died in captivity, said Netanyahu\u2019s public celebrations over the hostage releases contrasted with how he reacted when the outcome was not as positive. \u201cI am truly happy from the bottom of my heart for the families that were fortunate and able to hug their loved ones. I\u2019m also envious,\u201d Haaretz quoted him as saying. \u201cThis emphasizes how bad our ending was. When the ending is bad, the prime minister doesn\u2019t show up. He doesn\u2019t call, either.\u201d Hamas meanwhile accused\u00a0Israel\u00a0of committing \u201ca horrific massacre\u201d on civilians in Nuseirat. The militant group said\u00a0Israel\u2019s killing of scores of people as it mounted a hostage rescue operation was a \u201cbrutal crime, devoid of the values of civilization and humanity.\u201d   Palestinian\u00a0leader\u00a0Mahmoud Abbas has called for an emergency session of the\u00a0UN\u00a0Security Council while several MIddle Eastern countries condemned the operation. After the rescue mission, US national\u00a0security adviser\u00a0Jake Sullivan said an \u201cenduring ceasefire\u201d deal\u00a0between Israel and Hamas is \u201cthe only credible path forward.\u201d Sullivan acknowledged the civilian toll of Israel\u2019s military operation Saturday while saying Hamas, which took the hostages during its deadly October 7 attacks on Israel, was putting Palestinians in harm\u2019s way. What does it mean for the war? Hostage rescues are rare. This is only the third such successful operation of the conflict. Saturday\u2019s operation shows they are still possible and may encourage further efforts from the Israeli military, given a major goal of Israel\u2019s Gaza offensive is to rescue the remaining hostages. However some have pointed to a ceasefire deal as a much more effective way of freeing the hostages. More than 100 hostages were freed under a temporary truce last year, while Israel has rescued seven hostages by military means. Hagai Levine, of the health team at the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, said operations such as the one seen on Saturday were \u201cnot a way we can bring 120 hostages back home. \u201cWe must, all of us together, the world, follow President Biden speech and go with the deal that will enable all of them, dead or alive, come back home with a ceasefire.\u201d Instead, Levine called for a ceasefire deal that would \u201cenable all of [the hostages], dead or alive\u201d to be brought back home. There are warnings that the IDF\u2019s deadly operation on Saturday may have further set back a potential ceasefire agreement. An Egyptian official told CNN that Israel\u2019s operation will have a \u201cnegative effect\u201d on negotiations to end the war in Gaza. \u201c[It] won\u2019t be easy,\u201d the Egyptian official, who is familiar with the talks, told CNN. Egypt, along with Qatar, has been helping to coordinate negotiations between Israel and Hamas. On Sunday, the US called for a vote on its UN Security Council resolution backing the proposal for a permanent ceasefire and release of the hostages in\u00a0Gaza. \u201cIsrael has accepted this proposal and the Security Council has an opportunity to speak with one voice and call on Hamas to do the same,\u201d Nate Evans, the spokesperson for the US Mission to the UN, said in a statement Sunday. \u201cDoing so would help save lives and the suffering of civilians in\u00a0Gaza\u00a0as well as the hostages and their families,\u201d he said. Since November, intensive negotiations over a ceasefire and a deal to swap hostages for Palestinian prisoners have landed in a stalemate. Israel last month pressed ahead with its ground operation in central Rafah despite\u00a0international condemnation\u00a0for its escalation in the southern Gaza city where some\u00a01.3 million Palestinians\u00a0were taking shelter before Israel began its operation there.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/09/middleeast/israel-hostage-rescue-gaza-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_06_10_middleeast_iran-presidential-election-candidates-announced-intl", "text": "The Iranian election committee has approved a slate of mostly hardline candidates to run in the presidential election on June 28, following the helicopter crash that killed President Ebrahim Raisi and other officials last month. Out of 80 initial candidates, only six individuals were approved in a vetting process by Iran\u2019s Guardian Council, a powerful 12-member body charged with overseeing elections and legislation. There were four women on the longer list and none was approved. The slate includes hardline parliament speaker and former Revolutionary Guards commander Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf and Saeed Jalili, ex-chief nuclear negotiator and former head of the Supreme National Security Council, Iran\u2019s top security body. Competition is expected to be fierce between Qalibaf and Jalili, both of whom backed Raisi in the 2021 presidential election. \u201c(Qalibaf) and Jalili are on competing conservative poles and are unlikely to withdraw in favor of the other,\u201d wrote Sina Toossi, a DC-based Iran analyst and senior fellow at the Center for International Policy, in a post on X. The list also includes Amir Hossein Ghazizadeh Hashemi, Alireza Zakani, and Mostafa Pour Mohammad, all of whom are also hardliners. The Guardian Council has, however, also approved Masoud Pezeshkian, a reformist lawmaker who served as parliament deputy speaker from 2016 to 2020. Pezeshkian is expected to have a slim chance in the race. On Sunday, reformist newspaper Shargh Daily posted a photo of the six candidates with the caption, \u201cOne against five.\u201d During the Mahsa Amini protests in September 2022, Pezeshkian said in an interview, \u201cIt is our fault. We want to implement religious faith through the use of force. This is scientifically impossible.\u201d However, \u201cif the conservative vote is split, Pezeshkian could secure over 50% of the vote and win in the first round,\u201d said Toossi, adding that the outcome nonetheless \u201chinges on the turnout of the traditional reformist base, which has boycotted the past several elections.\u201d Notably absent from the list of approved candidates are two-term president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and former parliament speaker Ali Larijani. Both men were also previously disbarred by the Guardian Council. Raisi\u2019s death and the nearing vote come at a delicate time for a country facing unprecedented challenges at home and from abroad. The Islamic Republic\u2019s economy remains crippled by American sanctions, its young population is becoming growingly restive, and the nation faces increasingly belligerent adversaries in the Middle East and beyond. The June 28 poll\u00a0also comes amid dwindling trust in the establishment, leading to plummeting electoral turnouts in a country that has traditionally boasted exceptionally high voter participation.

{"id": "2024_05_25_style_zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk", "text": "Above Beijing\u2019s imperial center rises Jingshan, or Prospect Hill. From a pagoda at its modest peak, a panoramic view of the city presents itself. To the south, the dull golden roofs of the Forbidden City crest and fall, pulling the eye southward to Tiananmen \u2014 the Gate of Heavenly Peace \u2014 and the vast square of the same name just beyond. To the east stand the smooth metallic skyscrapers of the city\u2019s business district. To the north, at the top of Beijing\u2019s central axis \u2014 its so-called dragon\u2019s vein \u2014 sit the Bell and Drum Towers, which once acted as the city\u2019s collective timepiece. And stretching all along the western periphery are the calm, tree-lined waters of the manmade lakes, dug by hand for the pleasure of past emperors. It\u2019s this aerial view of \u201cZhongnanhai,\u201d meaning \u201cmiddle and southern seas,\u201d and the surrounding buildings that today\u2019s Chinese leaders prefer you did not see. That\u2019s because the 1,500-acre site of repurposed imperial pavilions and temples, along with gray modern offices has formed the leadership compound for the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP)  since 1950. As the seat of power, Zhongnanhai is often thought of as China\u2019s equivalent to the White House, or the Kremlin. Synonymous with China\u2019s communist party elite, and among the country\u2019s most secretive places, it is ringed by a centuries-old red ochre wall, with countless CCTV cameras periscoping above it \u2014 and patrolled assiduously by security forces in both plain clothes and uniform. A peaceful getaway For Chinese leader Xi Jinping\u2019s imperial forebears, the site served a somewhat different function. While emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties ruled their vast kingdom from within the Forbidden City, they built temples, halls and living quarters in Zhongnanhai; less grandly ceremonial than those of the palace, they were often oriented to take advantage of the views afforded by the area\u2019s tranquil waters and carefully planned gardens. Many of these emperors came to favor passing their days surrounded by drooping willows in the cool and quiet of this cultivated pleasure garden. A story relayed by the scholar Geremie Barm\u00e9 in his book \u201cThe Forbidden City\u201d tells of the 18th-century Qianlong Emperor\u2019s daily routine at Zhongnanhai: Each morning, after a first breakfast of cold swallows nest soup, he would travel by heated palanquin to the gardens\u2019\u00a0Studio of Convivial Delight,\u00a0a pavilion he built to capitalize on the view of the South Lake, where he would breakfast again on a meal of\u00a018 dishes. As the historian and author of \u201cThe Shortest History of China,\u201d Linda Jaivin, told CNN via email: \u201cThere is something outrageous and yet poetic about the incredible coordination and effort required of a team of bearers, cooks and attendants, just so that an emperor could come, catch a view of the magnificent Ocean Terrace, scoff his food and (leave).\u201d The first ruler to view Zhongnanhai as primarily a place to govern from, not simply relax in, was the Empress Dowager Cixi, who effectively controlled China for almost five decades from 1861. She lived for many years in the gardens\u2019 Hall of Ceremonial Phoenixes, which became the center of political authority in China. She would die there in 1908. The serene surroundings of Zhongnanhai also became, under Cixi, a place of punishment and confinement. In 1898, following attempted reforms that displeased her, Cixi imprisoned her nephew, the Guangxu Emperor, on Yingtai Island, which juts out into the southern lake. Built as a miniature version of the mythical Penglai island, home to the immortals of Chinese legend, the tiny piece of land would become the emperor\u2019s home for most of his life, bar a brief period when the Boxer rebellion of 1900 forced the whole court to flee the capital. He would die on Yingtai Island from arsenic poisoning the day before the Empress Dowager herself. His imprisonment and death, said writer M. A. Aldrich, author of \u201cThe Search for a Vanishing Beijing: A Guide to China\u2019s Capital Through the Ages,\u201d perhaps adds a touch of poignancy for any subsequent resident of Zhongnanhai. \u201cIn addition to being a site that preserves sites of imperial splendor,\u201d he told CNN, \u201cit also functions as a reminder to the political elite about the consequences for stepping out of line.\u201d For Aldrich, however, the Zhongnanhai compound also represents the destructive impulses of the CCP towards its adopted capital in the years after 1949, when Mao Zedong proclaimed the foundation of the People\u2019s Republic. \u201cAs a political symbol of the New China, it has been torn up, rebuilt, expanded, and revamped so many times that its connection with its elegant past has been lost,\u201d Aldrich said. Architectural changes There have been serious revisions to the architecture of Zhongnanhai since the end of imperial rule in 1912. After the last emperor abdicated the throne, China\u2019s new president Yuan Shikai granted him the right to live on the northern section of the Forbidden City \u2014 and then took Zhongnanhai to be his new administration\u2019s headquarters. The changes he made to the imperial gardens were disparaged by many of the Westerners who visited them. \u201cWhatever may be one\u2019s opinion as to whether Yuan Shikai \u2018exalted his aim\u2019 in his political career, he certainly cannot be said to have done so as builder and architect,\u201d wrote L.C. Arlington and William Lewisohn in their 1935 book \u201cIn Search of Old Peking,\u201d \u201cfor all the buildings that have been erected or restored by him are in the worst possible taste.\u201d Most notable of these changes \u2014 at least to ordinary Beijingers \u2014 was the repurposing of a two-story pavilion at the very south of the gardens. Known as the Precious Moon Tower, it had been built decades earlier by the Qianlong Emperor for a homesick lover, a Muslim woman from Xinjiang, taken to Beijing as part of the spoils of war. The concubine would gaze south from the tower toward a mock mosque and bazaar the emperor had especially constructed to assuage her longing for home. Yuan refashioned this pavilion into the main entrance to his presidential compound, and established a tall watchtower just to its east. The gate was named Xinhuamen, or the Gate of New China. Today, the structure remains coated in the same deep red that graces the walls of all Beijing\u2019s imperial buildings, with a roof of glazed yellow tiles and detailing that runs below the roofline, picked out in blue and gold. The gate is now flanked by two red banners that speak to its modern purpose as China\u2019s political and party headquarters: \u201cLong Live the Great Communist Party of China\u201d reads one; and \u201cLong Live the Invincible Mao Zedong Thought\u201d on the other. On a screen wall recessed behind the entrance way, Chinese characters written in Mao\u2019s own calligraphic style declare: \u201cServe the People.\u201d Facing out onto Beijing\u2019s main east-west thoroughfare, the gate remains the most conspicuous part of Zhongnanhai. The rest of the compound has, since 1989, been firmly off-limits to the Chinese public. Seat of power Initially, after the communist victory in China\u2019s civil war in 1949, Mao Zedong took up residence at Shuangqing Villa in Fragrant Hills, another former imperial garden to the west of Beijing. Though wary of establishing himself in the imperial heart of Beijing \u2014 it is said that he refused ever to enter the Forbidden City, for fear of being associated with the power structures of old, feudal China he had fought to overthrow \u2014 Mao ultimately moved into Zhongnanhai and, in late 1949, he set up in the\u00a0Garden of Abundant Beneficence,\u00a0a large courtyard compound favored by both the Qianlong and Kangxi emperors, where he would hold court with dignitaries\u00a0and live\u00a0until 1966. Having re-established Zhongnanhai as a center of political power in the new China, Mao set about rebuilding the compound according to his tastes. \u201cSince 1949, an assortment of new architecture styles has encroached into Zhongnanhai, with a tennis court, gymnasium, swimming pools and Western buildings topped off with Chinese eave roofs adding a discordant note that would not have been appreciated by its traditionally-minded original owners,\u201d said Aldrich. In 1966, Mao moved from the Garden of Abundant Beneficence to a specially built house beside his beloved indoor swimming pool. He often summoned officials to speak to him as he bobbed in the water \u2014 and famously received Russian leader Nikita Khrushchev at his pool during a 1958 visit. \u201cTheir interpreters had to pace alongside the edge of the pool,\u201d said Jaivin. \u201cThe Russian couldn\u2019t swim and had to wear water wings. Mao loved both swimming and putting Khrushchev in his place. Finally, Khrushchev got sick of it, and clambered out to sit on the edge, dangling his feet in the water.\u201d In the residence next door, Mao lined his rooms with bookshelves housing an extensive library of Chinese classical literature. \u201cIt was here,\u201d noted Aldrich, \u201cwith the background trappings of a scholar, that he met Nixon and Kissinger in 1972.\u201d Most subsequent leaders have preferred to keep a house outside the Zhongnanhai compound. Deng Xiaoping lived, from 1977, in a courtyard house on a nearby lane adjacent to Beihai, the \u201cNorthern Sea\u201d of central Beijing\u2019s chain of lakes. While not officially disclosed, it is believed that more contemporary leaders, including Xi Jinping and his predecessors Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, have maintained homes in an exclusive gated compound in Jade Spring Hill, sometimes called the \u201cback garden\u201d of Chinese politics, out to the city\u2019s west. Aldrich noted that those leaders and party cadres who used Zhongnanhai as their primary residence often attracted unwelcome scrutiny for their activities, particularly during years of political turbulence. \u201cIn his memoirs, Chairman Mao\u2019s physician, Li Zhisui, commented that (the complex\u2019s) residents were always under surveillance,\u201d Aldrich said. \u201cDuring the Cultural Revolution, the simple act of making a fire would bring down the wrath of the security guards on the perpetrator. It was believed that such a fire was proof that incriminating or seditious materials were being destroyed.\u201d The imperial gardens offering vistas of Zhongnanhai\u2019s lakes have, today, been filled in with dozens of gray offices and meeting halls, many of which date to 1970s, when Zhongnanhai underwent significant razing and renovation \u2014 the rebuilding was so extensive that one visitor in 1979 described the grounds resembling a construction site, with muddy roads that were impossible to walk on. The contemporary compound splits roughly in two, with the northern buildings, on the banks of the \u201cmiddle lake,\u201d used as the headquarters of China\u2019s top executive body, the State Council. It is here that foreign dignitaries are admitted. Around the \u201csouthern lake,\u201d meanwhile, are the headquarters of the CCP, including, within Qinzheng Hall (the Hall of Diligent Government), the offices of the general secretary of the party (a post currently held by Xi). Many of the most historically significant political events to occur at Zhongnanhai have taken place in Huairen Hall, or the Hall of Cherished Compassion, on the western side of the Middle Lake. The hall was added to the imperial park during the late Qing dynasty, but was then extensively remodeled by the CCP in the early 1950s to impart a more august socialist grandeur. It is a broad, imposing ceremonial hall with staggered roofs of glazed green tiles falling in curved lines to upturned corners; the facade of austere grey brick is interrupted by red wooden pillars, windows and doors. The building\u2019s capacious interior houses a large auditorium, as well as numerous smaller meeting rooms. The hall has, for decades, served as the main meeting place for China\u2019s Politburo, the party\u2019s decision-making body usually comprising about two dozen members. On occasion, it has also hosted the Politburo\u2019s Standing Committee, the core of China\u2019s political elite, (the power of both bodies has notably dwindled in the era of Xi), though they most commonly meet in Qinzheng Hall, close to the general secretary\u2019s office. During the tumult of the Cultural Revolution vital discussions and debates occurred at Huairen Hall, and, in the months after its conclusion, it was there that three of the so-called Gang of Four \u2014 the political faction that included Mao\u2019s wife held responsible for the worst excesses of the era \u2014 were arrested, tricked into attending a meeting they thought was about the publication of the fifth volume of Mao\u2019s Selected Works. In April 1989, former party head Hu Yaobang suffered a heart-attack during a Politburo meeting at Huairen; his death a week later would trigger the Tiananmen Square protests that the government forcibly cracked down on in early June of that year. However, the compound hasn\u2019t always been so forbidden for the masses following the collapse of China\u2019s imperial dynasty. In the late 1920s, it became a park, with tourists allowed to boat on and swim in the lakes, while in the 1980s, the public could access some of its scenic and historical spots, including\u00a0Mao\u2019s\u00a0former residence, on\u00a0organized weekend tours.\u00a0Even early in 1989, a journalist for the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0was able to casually\u00a0drive\u00a0a senior official into the compound and drop him off inside.\u00a0During a period of warmer US and China relations in 2011, former Chinese president\u00a0Hu Jintao\u00a0invited\u00a0a group of American high school students to Zhongnanhai. Modern security concerns Today, Zhongnanhai is more closely-guarded than ever, though the inexorable development of the city has caused problems in maintaining the compound\u2019s secrecy. When an annex to the nearby Beijing Hotel was built in\u00a01973, authorities were panicked by the realization that from its upper floors one could quite easily see \u2013 and potentially target a sniper rifle \u2013 into Zhongnanhai. A building was hastily erected on the western edge of the Forbidden City to restrict this view. Likewise in 2018, when Beijing\u2019s new tallest building was\u00a0completed\u00a0\u2013 the 528-meter Citic tower, better known as the \u201cZun\u201d \u2013 the country\u2019s national security apparatus reportedly requisitioned the top floors amid fears that visitors or occupants might be able to spy into the compound. Beijing authorities did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on the security situation at the time. Zhongnanhai\u2019s entrance, Xinhuamen, has also been the site of repeated demonstrations in recent decades; in 1989, it was a gathering point for students taking part in the Tiananmen protests, whilst in 1999, more than 10,000 members of the since-banned Falun Gong gathered on the sidewalks near Zhongnanhai to protest their treatment at the hands of the government. So, while Zhongnanhai is sometimes compared to the White House, Aldrich argues that the paranoia with which the compound is today guarded makes it more like the imperial palace of centuries past: \u201cSince ordinary people are not allowed to enter Zhongnanhai, it is probably more appropriate to describe it as a \u2018New Forbidden City\u2019 for China\u2019s ruling elite rather than a place with a personal political resonance for the average citizen,\u201d he said. \u201cHeck, even the Kremlin is open to tourists!\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/style/zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_06_asia_north-korea-balloons-activists-kpop-intl-hnk", "text": "South Korean activists sent balloons carrying K-pop and K-dramas on USB sticks to their northern neighbor on Thursday, days after North Korean balloons of trash and \u201cfilth\u201d floated in the opposite direction. The activist group Fighters for a Free North Korea (FFNK) released the giant balloons in the early hours of Thursday morning, with videos showing them floating away, some dragging giant posters visible from afar while others carried smaller plastic packages. Inside the packages were 200,000 leaflets condemning North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, 5,000 USB sticks containing South Korean music videos and television shows, and 2,000 one dollar bills, according to FFNK. Groups such as FFNK have been sending these kinds of balloons for years, carrying items prohibited in the isolated totalitarian dictatorship \u2013 including food, medicine, radios, propaganda leaflets and pieces of South Korean news. In May, North Korea responded by sending its own giant balloons back south \u2013 containing trash, soil, pieces of paper and plastic, and what South Korean authorities described as \u201cfilth.\u201d Pyongyang claimed to have sent a total of 3,500 balloons carrying 15 tonnes of trash to its neighbor, according to state media KCNA, citing North Korea\u2019s Vice Defense Minister Kim Kang Il. Those balloons began landing in the South last week, temporarily disrupting flights and prompting authorities to warn residents to stay indoors. As of Monday, the South Korean military had found about 1,000 balloons. South Korean activists say they will continue to send the balloons north \u2013 even though doing so was banned by the government years ago. FFNK leader Park Sang-hak, a North Korean defector who fled to the South years ago, described the materials they sent as \u201cletters of truth and freedom.\u201d As a young man in North Korea, these balloons had offered him a rare glimpse into the outside world, he said. He recalled being in a public square in 1992 when \u201cI heard a huge balloon in the sky.\u201d \u201cThis round thing suddenly popped with a loud bang, then leaflets fell from the sky. I knew I wasn\u2019t supposed to look at those things, so I put one in my pocket and went to the bathroom to check it out,\u201d he said. The leaflet he pocketed contained stories about North Korean defectors and their escapes, some of whom had crossed into China before heading toward South Korea. Eight years later, Park fled the North \u2013 arriving in South Korea in 2000, and beginning his mission to send balloons across the border in 2006. The leaflets he sends carry information about the Kim family, including the assassination of the leader\u2019s half-brother Kim Jong Nam \u2014 as well as booklets about South Korea\u2019s economic and political development, including photos of the main Seoul airport and the country\u2019s fighter jets. \u201cSouth Korea is not an American colony or a wasteland of humanity like I learned in North Korea,\u201d he told CNN on Wednesday. \u201cWe sent money, medicine, facts, truth, and love, but to send filth and trash in return? That\u2019s an inhumane and barbaric act.\u201d Meanwhile, some South Korean residents living near the border are now on edge. \u201cI lived through the Korean War and other difficulties, and I was worried \u2026 What if we have another war?\u201d said 84-year-old Song Kwang-ja, a resident of Yongin city, on Thursday. \u201cThat reminded me of the old days. I still get goosebumps thinking and talking about it,\u201d she said, adding that the balloons \u201cfelt like a childish prank.\u201d The incident has also worsened strained relations between the two countries. South Korea announced this week it would resume \u201call military activities\u201d near the demarcation line \u2013 suspending a 2018 agreement signed by both nations at a brief time of relatively warm relations.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/asia/north-korea-balloons-activists-kpop-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "world"}}

In a statement Friday, the Dutch Defense Ministry said two Chinese fighter jets circled the frigate HNLMS Tromp several times, while its marine patrol helicopter was \u201capproached\u201d by two Chinese warplanes and a helicopter during a patrol. \u201cThis created a potentially unsafe situation,\u201d the statement said. CNN has asked the Chinese government for comment on the Dutch accusations. The Tromp was operating in the East China Sea in support of a multinational coalition enforcing United Nations sanctions on North Korea, known as the Pacific Security Maritime Exchange (PSMX), according to a statement from the European Union. The UN Security Council has passed multiple resolutions since 2006 imposing sanctions on North Korea for its nuclear weapons program. PSMX partner nations include Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, the United Kingdom and the United States, according to the US State Department. Before patrolling in the East China Sea, the Dutch frigate had made a port call in Busan, South Korea, where it participated in exercises with the South Korean Navy, the EU statement said. Tromp joins a growing list of vessels and aircraft that have accused China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army of conducting possibly unsafe maneuvers in the East and South China Seas and beyond in recent years. Last month, Australia accused a Chinese fighter jet of firing flares into the path of a naval helicopter operating from the destroyer HMAS Hobart over international waters of the Yellow Sea. The Hobart was also enforcing UN sanctions on North Korea. \u201cThis was an unsafe maneuver which posed a risk to the aircraft and personnel,\u201d a statement from Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles said at the time. China defended that action by its military and rejected Australia\u2019s claim that the interception was unsafe. \u201cUnder the guise of implementing United Nations Security Council resolutions, Australian warships and aircraft deliberately approached China\u2019s airspace to cause trouble and provocation, endangering China\u2019s maritime and air security,\u201d Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian told reporters at a regular briefing last month. \u201cAs a warning, the Chinese military took necessary measures at the scene. Relevant operations are legal, compliant, professional and safe.\u201d The incident was similar to\u00a0an encounter\u00a0in late October, when Canada said a Chinese fighter jet fired flares into the path of a Canadian military helicopter over the South China Sea. \u201cThe risk to a helicopter in that instance is the flares moving into the rotor blades or the engines so this was categorized as both unsafe and non-standard, unprofessional,\u201d Maj. Rob Millen, air officer aboard the Royal Canadian Navy frigate HMCS Ottawa, told CNN after the October incident. China also defended its actions in that incident and accused Canadian forces of conducting an unspecified \u201cmalicious and provocative act with ulterior motives.\u201d Two weeks before the South China Sea encounter, a Royal Canadian Air Force patrol plane reported an unsafe intercept by a Chinese jet while it was supporting the UN enforcement of sanctions on North Korea. China, which says its forces act in accordance with international law while protecting Chinese interests, has repeatedly claimed that US-led alliances in the Pacific are a threat to its security. Earlier this month in a speech to the Shangri-La Dialogue defense summit in Singapore, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Washington had made \u201chistoric progress\u201d in developing alliances and partnerships that have enhanced security in Asia in the past three years. In a Q&A session, a Chinese colonel asked Austin whether the US is planning to build a NATO-like alliance system in the Asia-Pacific region, and also blamed NATO for the Ukraine war. Hours later, a Chinese military spokesman accused the United States of \u201ccreating division and provoking confrontation\u201d in the region. \u201cThe US keeps creating chaos and has become the source of risks, as well as the destroyer to peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region,\u201d Jing Jianfeng, deputy chief of the Joint Staff Department at China\u2019s Central Military Commission, told reporters in Singapore.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/asia/chinese-military-harass-dutch-warship-intl-hnk-ml/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_09_asia_north-korea-balloons-response-intl-hnk", "text": "North Korea has yet again sent hundreds of trash-laden balloons toward its southern neighbor, reigniting a tit-for-tat exchange after South Korean activists sent floating packages in the other direction carrying K-pop and K-dramas on USB sticks. About 330 balloons carrying bags of trash had been sent by North Korea since Saturday night, of which about 80 have landed in South Korea, Seoul\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said on Sunday. Waste paper and plastic were found in the packages and there were no substances hazardous to safety, the JCS said. Around 1,060 balloons from the North have made it into South Korean territory since May 28, according to a CNN tally. South Korea\u2019s National Security Council held an emergency meeting Sunday to discuss responses to the latest wave of balloons. Last week, Pyongyang claimed to have sent a total of 3,500 balloons carrying 15 tonnes of trash to its neighbor, according to state media KCNA, citing North Korea\u2019s Vice Defense Minister Kim Kang Il. The South Korean military responded on Sunday afternoon local time by playing a loudspeaker broadcast into North\u00a0Korea, according to the JCS. South Korea\u2019s military once championed the propaganda broadcasts as part of psychological warfare against the North, until it withdrew the equipment following a 2018 summit between the neighbors. The broadcasts inform North\u00a0Korean soldiers and residents of the \u201creality of North\u00a0Korea,\u201d the development of\u00a0South\u00a0Korea, and\u00a0Korean culture, the JCS said, adding that it is \u201ccapable of immediately performing its mission within a few hours if necessary.\u201d The JCS said that North\u00a0Korea\u00a0is \u201cfully responsible\u201d for the current situation and urged the North to \u201cimmediately stop such mean acts like sending waste balloons.\u201d Whether the military plays another loudspeaker broadcast again is \u201cfully up to North\u00a0Korea\u2019s action,\u201d the JCS warned. Senior North\u00a0Korean official Kim Yo Jong, the sister of leader Kim Jong Un, said Seoul\u2019s resumption of loudspeaker broadcasts were \u201ca prelude to a very dangerous situation,\u201d in a statement carried by KCNA. She also called Pyongyang\u2019s recent balloon activities \u201clegitimate.\u201d The countries\u00a0have been cut off from each other since the\u00a0Korean War ended with an armistice in 1953. They are still technically at war, and the balloon feud has been going on for decades. Groups such as Fighters for a Free North Korea have long sent balloons carrying items prohibited in the isolated totalitarian dictatorship \u2013 including food, medicine, radios, propaganda leaflets and pieces of South Korean news. In May, North Korea responded by sending its own giant balloons south \u2013 containing trash, soil, pieces of paper and plastic, and what South Korean authorities described as \u201cfilth.\u201d Kim said the balloons were \u201cstrictly a responsive act\u201d to South Korea\u2019s years-long practice of sending balloons with anti-North Korea leaflets the other way. The minister said last week that North Korea would \u201ctemporarily halt dropping trash over the border,\u201d but on Thursday South Korean activists sent balloons to their northern neighbor carrying hundreds of thousands of leaflets condemning leader Kim Jong Un and 5,000 USB sticks containing K-pop and K-dramas. South Korea\u2019s JCS said Saturday night that North Korea was \u201cboosting its presumed trash balloons,\u201d and warned that the wind direction may lead to balloons moving south. It advised people to be careful of falling objects, not to touch the fallen balloons, and to report any they find to the nearest military base or to police.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/09/asia/north-korea-balloons-response-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_03_21_climate_wildfire-grass-risk-west-us", "text": "A ubiquitous, resilient and seemingly harmless plant is fueling an increase in large, fast-moving and destructive wildfires in the United States. Grass is as plentiful as sunshine, and under the right weather conditions is like gasoline for wildfires: All it takes is a spark for it to explode. Planet-warming emissions are wreaking havoc on temperature and precipitation, resulting in larger and more frequent fires. Those fires are fueling the vicious cycle of ecological destruction that are helping to make grass king. \u201cName an environment and there\u2019s a grass that can survive there,\u201d said Adam Mahood, research ecologist with the US Department of Agriculture\u2019s research service. \u201cAny 10-foot area that\u2019s not paved is going to have some kind of grass on it.\u201d Grass fires are typically less intense and shorter-lived than forest fires, but can spread exponentially faster, outrun firefighting resources and burn into the growing number of homes being built closer to fire-prone wildlands, fire experts told CNN. Over the last three decades, the number of US homes destroyed by wildfire has more than doubled as fires burn bigger and badder,  a recent study found. Most of those homes were burned not by forest fires, but by fires racing through grass and shrubs. The West is most at risk, the study found, where more than two-thirds of the homes burned over the last 30 years were located. Of those, nearly 80% were burned in grass and shrub fires. One part of the equation is people are building closer to fire-prone wildlands, in the so-called wildland-urban interface. The amount of land burning in this sensitive area has grown exponentially since the 1990s. So has the number of houses. Around 44 million houses were in the interface as of 2020, an increase of 46% over the last 30 years, the same study found. Building in areas more likely to burn comes with obvious risks, but because humans are also responsible for starting most fires, it also increases the chance a fire will ignite in the first place. More than 80,000 homes are in the wildland-urban interface, in the sparsely populated parts of Kansas and Colorado that Bill King manages. The US Forest Service officer said living on the edge of nature requires an active hand to prevent destruction. Property owners \u201cneed to do their part too, because these fires \u2013 they get so big and intense and sometimes wind-driven that they could spot miles ahead even if we have a huge fuel break,\u201d King said. \u2018A perfect storm\u2019 for fire Climate change-fueled fire is attacking the western half of the US on all fronts. \u201cGlobally, the places that burn the most are places that have intermediate precipitation,\u201d said John Abatzoglou, a climate professor at the University of California, Merced. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit like Goldilocks. Not too wet, not too dry, just right, with plenty of ignition.\u201d In America\u2019s grassy heartland, the typically dry and often windy Plains, a series of compounding extremes across seasons are creating ideal fire fuel conditions in perennial grasses. Grass is more plentiful here than in other regions in the US, offering more continuous fuel for fires to feed off. The region is seeing more megafires like Texas\u2019s largest fire, the Smokehouse Creek Fire, and more destructive ones like Colorado\u2019s Marshall Fire, which burned through more than 1,000 homes in 2021. Rainy springs fuel more grass growth. Then it goes dormant, or plays dead, in the winter. Warmer winters with less snow cover, especially in the Northern Plains, expose the grass to warmer, drier spells in the late winter and early spring, according to King and Todd Lindley, a fire weather expert for the National Weather Service in Norman, Oklahoma. Grass is uniquely flammable because of its sensitivity to weather, Lindley said. Unlike in forests, it doesn\u2019t take long spells of warm, dry weather to turn grass to tinder. Moisture can be sapped from the plant in as little as an hour and even a day after rain. Throw in a spark, strong winds and invasive shrubs that burn hotter and longer and you have a recipe for grass fire disaster. \u201cThese compound extremes, these sequences of extremes that follow one another, if you get the right sequence, it can be game on for this sort of wildfire,\u201d Abatzoglou said. \u201cBasically, you\u2019re creating a perfect storm for the fire to spread there.\u201d Grass invasion Extreme drought and years of forest neglect are creating larger and more intense fires in western forests, King said. \u201cWhen I started 30 years ago, a big fire was 30,000 acres, and now that\u2019s normal, that\u2019s typical,\u201d said King. \u201cI\u2019d have maybe one a year, one every couple of years of that size, and now we hear of 1-million-acre forest fires.\u201d Grass exists in forest systems, too, and acts like a fuse to connect easier-to-ignite finer fuels to larger, drought-impacted tree systems, creating and spreading more intense fires. When the trees die, grass moves in. Grass recovers from fire much faster than other plants and can burn again, sometimes within a matter of months. King has seen this firsthand. \u201cYou could have green grasses coming up in a burned-grass landscape within a day or two, that\u2019s how fast it rejuvenates,\u201d King said.\u201cForest recovery could take years or generations, or never recover in our lifetime, or our generation\u2019s.\u201d As more vegetation in the West burns, it\u2019s being replaced by both native and nonnative grass. In the desert, it\u2019s creating fire where it wasn\u2019t before, USDA\u2019s Mahood said. The same drought-fueled fires are now becoming bigger in deserts because of annual grasses, which unlike the perennial grasses in the Plains, don\u2019t exist year-round.  These grasses take advantage of rare bursts of rain to propagate, then die, forming a carpet of fire fuel on the desert floor. Two recent fires in California\u2019s Mojave National Preserve are perfect examples, Mahood said. Those fires took advantage of invasive red brome grass and burned hundreds of thousands of acres of Mojave Desert and over a million iconic Joshua Trees. The increasing hot and dry conditions then suppress native plant recovery.\u00a0 The result is more grass. The West\u2019s stubby, iconic sagebrush is the single biggest ecosystem in the Lower 48, but half of it has been lost or degraded over the last 20 years. A roughly Delaware-sized area of sagebrush falls victim to grass, fire and other stressors each year, a USGS study found. With more grass and a complex web of climate stressors comes more fire risk now and increasingly in the future. \u201cIt may seem bad now, but this will probably not seem nearly as bad in the next decade,\u201d Mahood said. \u201cThink about how bad the fire season was two decades ago \u2013 now, that seems like nothing.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/21/climate/wildfire-grass-risk-west-us/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "world"}}

The announcement comes after US President Joe Biden unveiled executive action that would bar people who cross the US-Mexico border illegally from requesting asylum, during periods when there is a high volume of illegal crossings. Unless they meet certain exemptions, the asylum-seekers would be turned away to Mexico or returned to their home countries. The\u00a0president\u2019s proclamation, announced Tuesday, still allows for the normal flow of commerce and legal immigration across the border. Asked whether Biden\u2019s plan could lead to a potential increase of migrants on the Mexican side of the border, Mexico\u2019s president said, \u201cWe are seeking an agreement that if they (the US) make the decision to deport, they do so directly.\u201d L\u00f3pez Obrador added that he is not worried about Mexican border towns being overwhelmed by asylum seekers pushed back by the US. \u201cThey come to Mexico. We have no problem. We treat them all very well (\u2026) but why not a direct agreement?\u201d he said. Biden and L\u00f3pez Obrador also held a phone call on Tuesday, which the Mexican president described as \u201crespectful\u201d and \u201cvery amicable,\u201d saying they spoke about the need to support Latin American nations. A \u2018virtual wall\u2019 While some critics argue Biden\u2019s sweeping migration measure\u00a0doesn\u2019t go far enough in responding to the large numbers of people showing up at the US southern border, others warn that closing the\u00a0border\u00a0to\u00a0asylum\u00a0seekers\u00a0will endanger vulnerable people. In practice, the new rule would imply \u201cclosing the border\u201d to the thousands of refugees who are in Mexico waiting to reach the United States, Tonatiuh Guill\u00e9n, professor at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) and former commissioner of the National Migration Institute of Mexico, told CNN. \u201cIt implies a kind of virtual wall because people are going to be in a scenario where they are going to be rejected. On the other hand, if this measure is implemented, it leaves thousands of people without the possibility of shelter,\u201d Guillen said. Mexican authorities have largely played down any expected impact. A source at Mexico\u2019s asylum commission COMAR also told CNN that the agency is not very concerned about a potential increase in refugee applications \u201cbecause normally, the migrants who reached the northern border of Mexico are not interested in requesting asylum in Mexico.\u201d L\u00f3pez Obrador said what he \u201cliked the most\u201d about his call with Biden was the US\u2019 plan to build three new border bridges. \u201cThis is going to help a lot in the economic and commercial development throughout the region,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/americas/mexicos-us-deportation-country-of-origin-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_07_americas_panama-migrants-darien-gap-intl-latam", "text": "Panamanian figures show at least 174,513 migrants crossed the treacherous Dari\u00e9n Gap, a mountainous rainforest region connecting South and Central America, from January to June 6 of this year. The latest figures are higher than around the same period in 2023, when more than 166,000 crossings were reported, according to Panama\u2019s National Migration Service. The Dari\u00e9n Gap, which a decade ago was seen as an almost impassable barrier, has continued to see an increase in the number of migrants willing to risk their lives and safety to cross it. According to migration service figures, a record 520,000 people crossed the jungle last year. Experts say many continue to journey towards the United States in search of better opportunities. The National Migration Service of Panama said Thursday that in the first six days of June 2024, at least 4,499 people \u2013 3,598 adults and 901 minors \u2013 arrived in the country. This comes as the number of children crossing the Dari\u00e9n Gap has increased by 40% this year, putting the route on track to see record levels of child migration for the fifth consecutive year, according to a report by the United Nations\u2019 children\u2019s agency. The UNICEF report added that in the first four months of 2024, over 30,000 children crossed the Dari\u00e9n Gap, and that 2,000 were unaccompanied or separated from their families. This comes as Panamanian politicians seek to harden the country\u2019s borders. During his election campaign, Panama\u2019s president-elect Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino said that he wanted to \u201cclose the Dari\u00e9n,\u201d citing safety concerns. He explained in early May that he had proposed to initiate \u201ca repatriation process with full respect for human rights\u201d for the hundreds of thousands of migrants who pass through the area each year. \u201cSo that those from there, and those who would like to come, know that those who arrive here will be returned to their country of origin,\u201d Mulino said. Mulino\u2019s plan may prove unfeasible given that the jungle is 266 kilometers (165 miles) long. Discouraging migrants from crossing could be a tough challenge since many of them pay human smugglers operating on both sides of the borders. \u201cIn practical terms, trying to reduce migration through the Dari\u00e9n is a difficult task. The complexity is not just about entry points, but how to manage and have better information on who is helping migrants get through,\u201d Ariel Ruiz, a policy analyst at the Washington-based Migration Policy Institute, told CNN. The 66-mile (106-kilometer) hike through the Darien Gap brings migrants from Colombia to Panama and is a crucial passage for those hoping to reach the United States and Canada. Mass migration across the Western Hemisphere has\u00a0fueled a growing number\u00a0of people moving north. The journey carries multiple risks for migrants, including robberies, assaults, kidnappings, diseases, wild animal attacks, and accidents in a jungle full of rivers, mountains, and mud flats, according to the UN Refugee agency, UNHCR.

{"id": "2024_06_10_middleeast_inside-israels-hostage-rescue-intl-dst", "text": "Two days after an Israeli military operation rescued four hostages being held by Hamas in Nuseirat refugee camp, central Gaza, killing more than 270 Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials, new details are emerging about what was one of the most dramatic and deadly events since the war started. The daytime rescue operation, which took weeks of planning, caught militants holding hostages in two different buildings in a densely packed civilian area off guard. It appeared to have been carried out by Israeli forces using non-military vehicles, including a white Mercedes van, according to eyewitnesses, whose accounts tallied with videos analyzed by CNN. Eyewitnesses also said that they saw Israeli forces in disguise \u2013 dressed as Hamas fighters or civilians. \u201cThey were dressed in military uniforms like resistance fighters, carrying helmets and wearing signs of the [Hamas] resistance, giving the impression to people that they were resistance fighters, but in reality, they were an Israeli special forces unit,\u201d Khalil Al Tirawi, a local resident, told CNN. The Israeli military denied using civilian vehicles, but declined to say whether the officers conducting the rescue were disguised as militants or dressed as Palestinian civilians. The Israeli military had previously used civilian clothing as a tactic in its operations. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the units on the ground were given the \u201cgo\u201d at 11 a.m. local time and, by 11:25 a.m., began the raids simultaneously on both buildings where militants were holding the hostages \u2014 Noa Argamani, Almog Meir Jan, Andrey Kozlov and Shlomi Ziv, all of whom were taken on October 7 from the Nova music festival in Hamas\u2019 deadly cross-border terror attack. The Israeli soldiers managed to reach the apartment where guards were holding Argamani \u2014 pictured in a viral video being driven to Gaza on the back of a motorbike \u2013 undetected. \u201cIn Noa Argamani\u2019s building, we surprised them completely,\u201d Adm. Daniel Hagari, an IDF spokesman, said. But soon after the mission got underway, Israeli soldiers and militants began to exchange fire, according to eyewitness accounts and statements from the Israeli military. Eyewitnesses said that heavy bombardment followed, with missiles and rockets raining down on the densely packed camp, home to thousands of displaced families. A 45-second edited helmet camera video released Monday by the Israeli police and the Israeli Security Agency showed the moment the three male hostages were rescued. Heavy gunfire could be heard throughout the video, intensifying after the hostages left the building, and two soldiers were seen wearing uniforms. By the time that the hostages, referred to by the code name \u201cdiamonds,\u201d\u00a0were brought to the Mediterranean coast and successfully evacuated in two helicopters, the operation had left a deadly trail of destruction in its wake. The latest figures from Gazan authorities say 274 Palestinians were killed and 698 injured \u2013 which would mark one of the deadliest days in months for people living in Gaza. The IDF has disputed those numbers, saying it estimated the number of casualties from the operation was \u201cunder 100.\u201d CNN cannot independently verify either side\u2019s figures. Gaza\u2019s health ministry does not distinguish between civilians and militants. \u2018We felt like it was the apocalypse\u2019 The IDF said that two teams from an Israeli police counter-terrorism special forces unit were sent into the two apartment buildings in the camp to retrieve the hostages simultaneously out of concern that if Hamas realized\u00a0there was a rescue operation ongoing in one building, they might kill the hostages in the other. As Argamani was extracted by Israeli forces, in the other apartment 200 meters away, where the three male hostages were being held, a gunfight broke out, according to the IDF. The IDF said a counter-terrorism special forces squad commander in the Yamam (National Police Counter-Terrorism Unit), Arnon Zamora,\u00a0was fatally wounded in that gunfight. Al Tirawi and another man, both of\u00a0whom are living across from where part of the rescue operation took place, in the center of Nuseirat refugee camp, said that they saw Israeli soldiers arrive in civilian cars in disguise. Abdullah Jouda, who was displaced from Jabalia to Nuseirat camp during the war, told CNN that he heard noises on the street around 11:30 a.m. and went to see what was happening. When he opened the door, he said he saw\u00a0men, who he believes were Israeli forces, leaving a Mercedes van dressed in all black and wearing the emblem for Hamas\u2019 military wing Al Qassam Brigades. \u201cI saw special forces, as soon as they left the vehicle, they had ladders on the balcony and [were] climbing them \u2026 I only saw them for approximately two seconds because if I looked at them longer, I could have been killed,\u201d Jouda said. \u201cThere was heavy gunfire \u2026 almost everything was being fired on. Warplanes were firing, drones were firing, sound grenades. It was terrifying, we felt like it was the apocalypse.\u201d CNN could not independently verify his claims, but a\u00a0video showed a white Mercedes van, with mattresses, plastic bags and other objects strapped to its roof \u2013 a frequent sight in the camp, where many people have sought shelter from the war, their belongings in tow \u2013\u00a0was parked on a street where the operation unfolded. Two ladders could be seen leaning up against a multistorey building next to the van, reaching up to a higher floor. A body appears to be visible on the ground in front of the truck. \u201cThere they are. They are still there!\u201d a woman filming the 6 second clip can be heard saying. The video of the hostage rescue shared by Israeli police and the Israeli Security Agency was geolocated to the same location by CNN. The IDF said its forces came under heavy fire from militants, including with rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs), and that it responded with strikes to support the team on the ground as the extraction efforts continued. \u201cThey were firing RPGs and firing at our forces \u2026 the cynical way that Hamas is using the population to fire at our forces, embedding themselves in the civilians is tragic,\u201d Hagari said, adding that there was \u201cso much fire was on our forces, we needed to fire from the air and from the street.\u201d In one video shared with CNN by local journalist Fadi Thabet, two US-made air-to-ground hellfire missiles can be seen flying in different directions at 11:28 a.m., according to its metadata. One appears to hit the opposite side of the building where the white Mercedes van was parked outside, while the other impacts another building nearby. Footage from the aftermath of the strike shows both the van and building destroyed. Two explosive weapons experts, Trevor Ball, a former US army explosive ordnance disposal technician, and Richard Weir, senior crisis and conflict researcher at Human Rights Watch, confirmed the munitions. The intense aerial bombardment destroyed apartment buildings and vehicles throughout Nuseirat camp, according to witnesses and video footage. \u201cGunfire was coming from multiple sources, but we couldn\u2019t witness everything as anyone who tried to look would be at risk of being killed,\u201d Al Tirawi said.\u00a0\u201cIt is beyond imagination \u2013 a barrage of heavy gunfire, artillery missiles, rockets.\u201d Another local resident, Nidal Abdo, was buying groceries at the market in Nuseirat when he said the strikes intensified.\u00a0\u201cMaybe 150 rockets fell in less than 10 minutes, while we were running away more fell on the market,\u201d he said, adding that he had never witnessed anything like it in Gaza before.\u00a0\u201cThey wiped out Nuseirat, it is hell on earth.\u201d \u2018The diamonds have taken off\u2019 In another video from Al Jazeera, verified by CNN, a truck emblazoned with a brand of dishwashing soap, resembling a vehicle commonly used to bring aid in Gaza, could be seen traveling on a road accompanied by a tank and Israeli armored vehicles about a mile from the refugee camp. The vehicles headed away from the camp and in the direction of an area near the US military\u2019s floating pier on the Mediterranean coast, where the extraction took place. CNN was not able to verify the time the video was filmed, so could not determine whether it took place before or after the raid. The Israeli military denied using the US-built pier in the operation. A senior Biden administration official tells CNN that Israeli forces did not use an aid truck in the operation. As for the use of the US pier, the official said: \u201cThey landed close to the pier but not on it.\u201d The IDF said two helicopters were used to evacuate the hostages, one of which they later shared footage of. The first helicopter evacuated Argamani and the second transported the three male hostages along with the then-wounded, Zamora, who later died in hospital. A video geolocated by CNN shows a helicopter taking off from the beach in Gaza, close to the US floating pier. The IDF released a video on Sunday capturing the moment that military officials first heard that the three male hostages had also been successfully rescued. In it,\u00a0Maj. Gen. Yaron Finkelman, who commands the Southern Command of the IDF, can be heard saying, \u201cThe three diamonds have just taken off to the landing towards the country.\u201d The IDF said it got intelligence on the location of the hostages through different avenues, including from the United States. A US official told CNN that an American cell in Israel supported the efforts to rescue four Israeli hostages, working with Israeli forces on the operation, referring to a team that\u2019s been in place supporting Israel since October 7 with information gathering about the hostages. \u201cThere were no US forces, no US boots on the ground involved in this operation,\u201d national security adviser Jake Sullivan told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash on \u201cState of the Union.\u201d Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office said that the prime minister had approved the rescue operation last Thursday and was present in the command room during the operation. Preparations for the raid began weeks ago and hundreds of personnel from the Israeli military, domestic intelligence service and police special unit were involved, Hagari said, adding that they opted to carry it out during the day to afford them a greater element of surprise. As part of their preparations, the military built models of the apartments the hostages were held in after receiving intelligence regarding their location Hagari told journalists Saturday that similar raids had been called off at the last minute \u201cmore than three or four times\u201d due to unfavorable conditions for Israeli special forces. He did not specify whether those operations concerned the same four hostages or others held in Gaza. Most of the other hostages are not being held in conditions that would allow for similar operations, he said. Hostages being held in Gaza are frequently moved to different locations, Hagari said, adding that Argamani had previously been held elsewhere. After their evacuation, the hostages were then flown to Sheba Medical Center in Ramat Gan, near Tel Aviv. Argamani was later transferred to Ichilov Hospital in Tel Aviv to be treated alongside her mother who has late-stage brain cancer.

{"id": "2024_04_17_style_copenhagen-stock-exchange-fire-police-investigation-intl", "text": "Police launched an investigation Wednesday into the fire that tore through Copenhagen\u2019s famous stock exchange building, causing the collapse of its spire and damaging centuries-old artwork and architecture. The blaze was still burning on Wednesday afternoon, more than 24 hours after it began, and authorities and citizens in the Danish capital have started reckoning with the loss of one of the city\u2019s most recognizable landmarks. Local firefighters continued to try to put out the fire, which ripped through\u00a0the building \u2013 known locally as B\u00f8rsen \u2013\u00a0from early Tuesday, reaching all its floors and causing the collapse of a dragon-tail spire that had long been a symbol of the city. The walls of the building are still standing, but the interior has been significantly damaged and the roof is partially collapsed. Firefighters used cranes to hose water down into the building. Copenhagen\u00a0police meanwhile launched an investigation on Wednesday, which they said will be a \u201ccomplicated process.\u201d Police officer Brian Belling said authorities have already \u201cconducted interviews, secured surveillance and carried out a large number of investigative steps.\u201d \u201cBut of course, there is still a lot to do, especially as we have not yet had the opportunity to examine\u00a0B\u00f8rsen itself,\u201d Belling added. The 17th century building exemplified the style of the Dutch Renaissance, and housed a number of artworks, some of which were saved on Tuesday. Residents were stunned by the outbreak, which brought back memories of the fire that tore through the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris exactly five years and a day earlier. \u201cMy first thought was (that) I hope that they rebuild it \u2013 it\u2019s never going to be the same but it\u2019s iconic to\u00a0Copenhagen\u00a0and Denmark,\u201d teacher Eva Simoni Lomholdt, 58, told Reuters. Brian Mikkelsen, the CEO of the Danish Chamber of Commerce which owns the building, told the news agency that a firefighter gave him the top of the spire on Wednesday morning after it was recovered following its fall. \u201cIt gives me hope because we have decided to rebuild the stock exchange because it\u2019s part of European history as a trading continent,\u201d he said. The old stock exchange \u2013 located only a few minutes walk from Christiansborg\u00a0Palace \u2013 dates back to 1625. It was built in the Dutch Renaissance style at the request of King Christian IV and had recently been undergoing renovations with its facade covered in scaffolding and protective coverings. It has been at the heart of Danish business since then; while it no longer houses the Danish stock exchange, it serves as the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce. Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said Tuesday a \u201cpiece of Danish history\u201d was on fire, calling the building \u201cirreplaceable.\u201d Denmark\u2019s culture minister Jakob Engel-Schmidt added that 400 years of cultural heritage had been damaged. \u201cHow touching it is to see how the employees at B\u00f8rsen, good people from the emergency services and passers-by work together to rescue art treasures and iconic images from the burning building,\u201d he said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/17/style/copenhagen-stock-exchange-fire-police-investigation-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "travel_worlds-50-best-restaurants-for-2024", "text": "Any doubts that Spain remains the fine dining center of the world may just have evaporated with the revealing of the World\u2019s 50 Best Restaurants for 2024 list. Five eateries from the European nation made the list \u2013 three of them in the top five. The awards\u00a0\u2013 considered the Oscars of global fine dining \u2013 were handed out at a ceremony at the Wynn in Las Vegas on Wednesday evening, with Barcelona\u2019s Disfrutar walking away with the top prize. Ranked number two last year, it\u2019s owned and run by chefs Oriol Castro, Eduard Xatruch and Mateu Casanas. The fact that this trio met while working at the legendary El Bulli should provide a few clues as to what diners can expect \u2013 imaginative and playful dishes executed with technical mastery, such as the caviar-filled Panchino doughnut, the frozen gazpacho sandwich and squab with kombu spaghetti, almond and grape. Coming in at number two was Asador Etxebarri of Atxondo, not far from the Spanish port city of Bilbao. Under the leadership of chef Victor Arguinzoniz, it\u2019s famed for offering unbeatable barbecue that lets the quality of the ingredients shine, such as a red Palam\u00f3s prawn that\u2019s simply grilled and served on its own. But you can never count Paris out.\u00a0The French capital\u2019s Table by Bruno Verjus\u00a0squeezed into third place, while yet another restaurant from Spain \u2013 Madrid\u2019s Diverxo \u2013 took the fourth spot. Coming in at fifth was Lima\u2019s Maido, one of three restaurants from the city to make the list, giving the Peruvian capital\u2019s reputation as South America\u2019s premier dining destination yet another boost. Mexico was the big winner in North America, earning three restaurants on the list, led by Mexico City eatery Quintonil, which came in seventh. The rest of the list Securing five restaurants on the list was enough to make Spain the biggest winner of the night in Vegas. In terms of cities, Paris and Bangkok tied for first, each with four restaurants on the list. Gaggan Anand, at number nine, was the Thai capital\u2019s top entry. As for the event\u2019s host country, the US had two restaurants on this year\u2019s 50 Best list. New York City\u2019s Atomix came in 6th this year, rising two spots since last year. SingleThread, in the town of Healdsburg in California\u2019s Sonoma Valley, landed in 46th place. Three restaurants from Tokyo were awarded, with eatery S\u00e9zanne\u00a0(voted Asia\u2019s best restaurant in 2024) ranking the highest in the Japanese capital, at 15. Hong Kong saw two of its restaurants hit the list, with both making impressive moves. Wing was the city\u2019s highest new entry on the entire list, at 20, while The Chairman was the highest climber, moving from last year\u2019s 50th spot into number 26. The list is compiled based on the votes of the\u00a0The World\u2019s 50 Best Restaurants Academy, which is made up of\u00a0 1,080 international restaurant industry experts including food writers and chefs, in 27 regions around the world. Restaurants can only win the top prize once, after which they\u2019re entered into a separate \u201cBest of the Best\u201d program. Members of that elite group include Geranium and Noma in Copenhagen, as well as New York\u2019s Eleven Madison Park, The Fat Duck near London, Osteria Francescana in Modena, Italy, and Mirazur in Menton, France. Last year\u2019s winner, Central of Lima, Peru, now joins them on that list. The world\u2019s 50 best restaurants 2024 1. Disfrutar\u00a0(Barcelona, Spain) 2.

{"id": "2024_06_10_tech_hospital-cyberattack-google-microsoft", "text": "Microsoft and Google will offer free or discounted cybersecurity services to rural hospitals across the United States to make them less vulnerable to cyberattacks that have disrupted patient care and threatened lives, the White House and those tech firms said Monday. Microsoft said in a statement to CNN that it would provide free security updates for eligible rural hospitals, as well as security assessments and training for hospital staff. Google will provide free cybersecurity advice to rural hospitals and start a pilot program to match the firm\u2019s cybersecurity services with the needs of rural hospitals. The nation\u2019s roughly 1,800 rural community hospitals are among the most vulnerable to dangerous ransomware attacks because they often lack IT security resources and cybersecurity-trained staff. And they may be the only hospitals within dozens of miles, meaning a ransomware attack that prevents a hospital from accepting ambulances can put patients\u2019 lives at risk. The new announcement is\u00a0the result of private discussions between the tech firms and officials at the White House National Security Council who have growing increasingly concerned about cyber threats to hospitals. It\u2019s an effort to use the broad reach of Microsoft and Google\u2019s software, which is used in hospitals across the United States, to help plug a gap in the defense of the health care sector. \u201cWe\u2019re in new territory as we see \u2026 this wave of attacks against hospitals,\u201d Anne Neuberger, the top cyber official at the White House National Security Council, told reporters on Sunday. The Biden administration is also preparing to issue minimum cybersecurity requirements for US hospitals. The details of that proposal have yet to be finalized. But the American Hospital Association, which represents hospitals across the United States, opposes the proposal, saying it would impose penalties on the victims of cyberattacks after they are hacked. A growing problem The number of ransomware attacks against the US healthcare sector increased by 128% in 2023 compared to 2022,\u00a0according to data\u00a0released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. And recent ransomware attacks have brought the sector\u2019s vulnerability into sharp relief. A February ransomware attack on a major health insurance billing firm\u00a0cut off health providers\u00a0from billions of dollars and put some health clinics on the brink of bankruptcy. UnitedHealth Group, whose subsidiary was hacked, paid a $22 million ransom to the hackers to try to recover patient data. One third of Americans may have had their data stolen. Another ransomware attack, in May, on one of America\u2019s largest hospital chains,\u00a0put patients\u2019 lives in danger\u00a0as nurses were forced to manually enter prescription information, multiple nurses at affected hospitals told CNN. The FBI and its international allies have conducted a series of crackdowns on ransomware gangs, seizing the computers they use and unlocking some of the victim computers that hackers have encrypted. But ransomware remains a flourishing business, in part, US officials say, because many of its perpetrators operate with impunity from Russia. The health care sector is a particularly enticing target because hospitals under duress to restore patient services\u00a0are sometimes willing\u00a0to pay the ransom. \u201cWe do see a much more permissive environment in Russia by both hacktivists and criminals, and it\u2019s of concern,\u201d Neuberger, the White House official, told reporters. \u201cWe also see more and more companies paying ransoms. And every ransom payment feeds the beast and drives further attacks.\u201d Cleveland cyberattack shuts City Hall Cyberattacks have frequently shut down other vulnerable services. The\u00a0City of Cleveland is\u00a0investigating a cyber incident, according to a statement from mayor Justin\u00a0Bibb. As a precaution, the city said it closed City Hall Monday, and it will keep City Hall closed Tuesday. Cleveland also shut down all of its internal systems and software. But city and emergency services like the Department of Public Safety, 911, police, the fire department, ambulances and the Department of Public Utilities, will remain operational, Bibb\u2019s office said. However, the mayor said the emergency services are functioning with limited IT capabilities. \u201cOver the weekend, the city identified some abnormalities,\u201d Commissioner Kimberly\u00a0Roy-Wilson, with the city\u2019s Division of Information Technology Services, said. \u201cWe have moved into our protocols and procedures with regards to containment and we are now investigating the nature and scope of those abnormalities.\u201d Bibb would not say how many or which agencies are helping with the investigation.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/tech/hospital-cyberattack-google-microsoft/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_10_africa_boko-haram-nigerian-girls-neglected-amnesty-says-intl", "text": "Girls and young women freed from Boko Haram terrorists in northeast Nigeria\u00a0continue to suffer severe hardships, including unlawful military detention, neglect, and inadequate support to start over, according to a new Amnesty\u00a0International report. While protracted military detention has decreased recently, the report\u00a0released Monday\u00a0noted that many women still experienced mistreatment. Titled, \u201c\u2018Help us build our lives\u2019: Girl Survivors of Boko Haram and Military Abuses in Northeast Nigeria,\u201d it probes how girls and young women have been abducted, forced into marriage, and subjected to sexual violence by Boko Haram. Survivors recounted giving birth to children fathered by Boko Haram fighters, often when they were still minors themselves. One young woman revealed that she twice witnessed Boko Haram members execute women who had taken contraceptive pills. Based on 126 interviews with women and girls aged between 12 and 48 years old,\u00a0including 82 who survived being abused while children,\u00a0the report details the atrocities carried out by Boko Haram.\u00a0The interviews were conducted between 2019 and 2024 in northeast Nigeria, with the majority undertaken in the past year. Amnesty\u00a0has contacted several global partners about its findings, including the office of the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, urging it to investigate\u00a0\u201ccrimes under international law committed by all parties during the conflict in north-east Nigeria.\u201d Amnesty\u00a0researchers say they spoke to nearly 50 girls and young women who escaped Boko Haram\u00a0and found their way to government-held territory, risking their lives\u00a0and those of their children\u00a0in the process. However, their horrific experiences at the hands of their captors were further compounded by the hardship they faced once they regained their freedom. \u00a0\u201cThese girls, many of whom are now young women, had their childhood stolen from them and suffered a litany of war crimes and other human rights abuses. They are now showing remarkable bravery as they seek to take control of their future,\u201d said Samira Daoud, Amnesty\u00a0International\u2019s regional director for West and Central Africa. \u2018Wives of Boko Haram\u2019 Among the 126, the Amnesty\u00a0team spoke to 31 girls and young women who described being unlawfully imprisoned in military custody between 2015 and mid-2023 for periods ranging from a few days to over four years, accused of having allegiances with Boko Haram. They described being humiliated by soldiers who called them \u201cwives of Boko Haram\u201d and accused them of being behind killings carried out by the terror group. Several told Amnesty\u00a0researchers of enduring beatings while detained by the military. One of them, named NV in the report, said she fled Boko Haram in 2021 when she was around 20. She said she was held for two months in Madagali, Adamawa State, by soldiers. NV said: \u201cWhen they [soldiers] brought food\u2026 they gave us a portion in our hand and soup in one bowl for all of us to share\u2026 As a toilet, they gave us a plastic bag.\u201d Another, called GN in the report, said Nigerian soldiers detained her after they raided the camp where she and others were held by Boko Haram, before being taken to an internally displaced persons (IDP) camp.\u00a0She had been forcibly married to a Boko Haram fighter while in captivity but remarried while living in the IDP for an extended period. She\u00a0later\u00a0received a call from her Boko Haram \u201chusband\u201d asking her to come back to him, which aroused suspicion from a neighbor who reported her to security forces, GN said. \u201cNigerian soldiers detained her in Bama Prison for around one month in the second half of 2021 and beat her with a cane for three days. She was pregnant at the time. The soldiers blindfolded her and transferred her to Giwa Barracks in Maiduguri. GN was unlawfully detained there for around one year, during which she gave birth,\u201d the report stated. By the time she regained her freedom, her Boko Haram \u201chusband\u201d had sued her and her new husband in sharia (Islamic) court and they were ordered to pay him money, it added. Amnesty\u00a0International said it had communicated its findings to Nigerian federal and state authorities. In response, the Nigerian Defense Headquarters in a statement sent to CNN Monday said the Armed Forces of Nigeria AFN \u201cmakes it unequivocally clear that, it is a professional military force that operates within the ambit of International law of armed conflict.\u201d Adding that it would encourage Amnesty \u201cto approach the military high command to substantiate their allegations. The military has self regulating mechanisms with which it administers the military justice system to address any proven case of misconduct of personnel.\u201d CNN has contacted the\u00a0Nigerian Army and the Borno State authorities for comment on the allegations. The\u00a0Borno State government, under an initiative to reintegrate fleeing and surrendered Boko Haram fighters, gave reassurances that they would not be prosecuted but allowed to stay with their families, including their wives, according to the report. \u201cBorno State Governor Babagana Zulum promised that Boko Haram fighters would not be handed over to the military and would be provided with services and allowed to stay with their families, including their \u2018wives,\u2019\u201d the report said. When Amnesty asked girls and young women about the screening process conducted by the military or government authorities after they had exited Boko Haram, \u201cnone of the interviewees said they were asked whether they had married or joined Boko Haram freely.\u201d This failure to attempt to identify victims of forced marriage or trafficking makes it even harder for the women and girls to access the support they are entitled to, the report said. A decade-long reign of terror Since 2009, the armed Islamist group\u00a0Boko Haram\u00a0has waged an insurgency estimated to have killed more than 35,000 people and displaced two million people in the country\u2019s northeast, according to the UN. During a reign of terror that spanned more than a decade, Boko Haram launched attacks on families in the northeast of Nigeria, with tactics including\u00a0\u201csuicide bombings, abductions, torture, rape, forced marriages, and recruitment of child soldiers,\u201d according to the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect. One of Boko Haram\u2019s most notorious abductions was the kidnapping of the Chibok schoolgirls in 2014, when nearly 300 students were taken from their school in Chibok, Borno State. This event prompted global outrage and spotlighted the insurgent group\u2019s brutal tactics. Since the Chibok abductions, many more girls have been abducted; most of them were forced into marriage. According to the report, Boko Haram engages in child and forced marriage. The interviewees described harsh treatment and public punishments and at least 31 girls told Amnesty\u00a0researchers they were forced to witness lashings, amputations, and beheadings. One girl referred to as GH in the report, was held captive for about 10 years. She recounted often being forced to watch violent punishments.\u00a0\u201cSometimes I dream about the corpses that I saw or the stoning of the women that I saw. Once I open my eyes, I can\u2019t go back to sleep again,\u201d she\u00a0said in the report. Many\u00a0survivors of Boko Haram\u00a0told Amnesty\u00a0that they witnessed Boko Haram killing their relatives. One\u00a0young woman, named as\u00a0CB\u00a0in the report,\u00a0said she was abducted at around\u00a0age\u00a013 in 2014. \u201cOne day, Boko Haram \u2026 came into our house. They told our father we were non-believers. They shot my father in the back of his head, and the bullet came through his eyes. We started crying. They said if we\u00a0don\u2019t\u00a0keep quiet, they\u00a0will\u00a0kill my mother too,\u201d she told researchers. Kidnapped girls were also forced into sexual slavery and domestic servitude as \u201cwives,\u201d with at least 33 survivors telling Amnesty\u00a0they were raped by the men they were forced to marry. One teenager, named as HA in the Amnesty\u00a0report, said she agreed\u00a0to get married to a Boko Haram militant to save her father\u2019s life. She added that she was frequently raped and beaten\u00a0during the \u201cmarriage,\u201d with other Boko Haram fighters helping her husband as he forced himself on her. Consequently, many of the girls and young women face long-term issues relating to their health,\u00a0have had\u00a0limited access to education, and\u00a0suffer\u00a0stigma from their loved ones and their community.

{"id": "2024_06_08_europe_ukraine-stabilizes-north-pressure-east-russia-intl", "text": "Ukraine\u00a0has\u00a0stabilized the\u00a0northern Kharkiv front\u00a0after Moscow launched an offensive a month ago,\u00a0thanks to more weapons and permission\u00a0to use them\u00a0to target positions within Russia. But\u00a0its forces are being stretched elsewhere along the 1,000km (620 miles) long front line and\u00a0are\u00a0defenseless against Russia\u2019s deadly aerial glide bombs. A senior\u00a0officer in\u00a0Ukraine\u2019s\u00a0Security Service\u00a0(SBU),\u00a0who goes by the call sign Bankir,\u00a0and is\u00a0currently fighting in the\u00a0Kharkiv\u00a0region, told CNN the ability to hit Russian targets across the border\u00a0was\u00a0already having a positive impact. \u201cIt is now possible to conduct local counter-attack operations and recapture the territories that, for example, were captured by the enemy a week ago,\u2019 the SBU officer said. For much of the war,\u00a0Ukraine has been constrained when it comes to using powerful Western weapons against Russia. Kyiv\u2019s allies have\u00a0long\u00a0been adamant that their fighting machines\u00a0must\u00a0not strike within Russian territory for fear of provoking Moscow,\u00a0limiting their use to targets within Ukraine, including in occupied areas. But that changed in the wake of the Kharkiv offensive. First, European countries including France and Germany allowed Ukraine to strike targets within Russia, then, most significantly, the US gave the go ahead for Ukraine to use its weaponry around Kharkiv. \u201cOur policy using long-range strike weaponry to go into Russia hasn\u2019t changed, but what we have done is provide Ukraine the ability to counterfire, to fire back at those Russian troops that are firing at them and to be able to take out their artillery batteries as they\u2019re firing at the Ukrainians and I think that\u2019s going to prove to be very, very helpful to Ukraine going forward,\u201d Secretary of Defense Lloyd\u00a0Austin told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer. The US HIMARS system has become the go-to weapon system to hit the Russian positions, according to Yehor Cherniev, deputy chairman of the Ukrainian Parliament\u2019s Committee on National Security, Defense and Intelligence. Due to the threat of being hit by HIMARS, the Russians have begun to use S-300 and S-400 missile systems much less to fire at the Kharkiv region but glide bombs remain an issue. These are dropped from so high they are out of range of Ukrainian defenses. \u201cUnfortunately, we do not yet have permission to hit Russian aircraft at airfields with American weapons and we do not have permission to use ATACMS missiles on Russian territory,\u201d\u00a0said Cherniev,\u00a0referring to a long-range missile system.\u00a0\u201cBecause of this, we have not yet been able to resolve the problem of glide bomb strikes on our territory. Kharkiv and other border areas are still suffering from bombing attacks, and a lot of civilians die.\u201d While the Russian advance has slowed as assessed by the US and Ukraine, Moscow\u2019s forces continue to press along the new front line\u00a0in the north. Russians are focusing on trying to push through the village of Hlyboke north of Kharkiv. If Russian forces manage to take hold there they could push through to the village of Lyptsi which sits 30 kilometers north of Kharkiv \u2013 bringing the city with historic, cultural and industrial importance within artillery range. Northeast of Kharkiv, Russian forces continue to maintain a foothold in the town of\u00a0Vovchansk. The fighting has turned to close combat, with units fighting street by street, according to Nazar Voloshyn,\u00a0a Ukrainian military spokesman in the east.\u00a0But\u00a0\u201cmost of the city is under the control of the Ukrainian Defense Forces\u201d Voloshyn told CNN. \u201cTo disperse the forces and means of our defense forces, the enemy launched an additional Kharkiv campaign\u2026 they partially succeeded, but the defense forces stabilized the situation,\u201d said Yurii Fedorenko, a company commander with the 92nd Separate Mechanized Brigade currently fighting in the Kharkiv region. The UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) recorded a \u201csignificant increase\u201d (31%) in civilians killed in Ukraine in May compared to April. According to HRMMU, more than half of the casualties occurred in the new northern front and because of \u201cair-dropped bombs and missiles in populated areas such as communities near the front line and Kharkiv city.\u201d To counter the Russians\u00a0in Kharkiv, Ukraine has to\u00a0divert men and arms\u00a0from other parts of the front line in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. A main goal for Russia has been to exert complete control over the two eastern regions. And that\u2019s exactly where Russia has been pressing quite actively, according to Voloshyn. In the east, Moscow had set its sites on on the town of Chasiv Yar in the Donetsk region. Russian troops have made some advances. Further south along the eastern front line, Russians have made advances to the west of the city of Avdiivka which fell to Russian forces in February. \u201cThe Russian army is trying to do everything possible on the front line before the arrival of US aid to Ukraine and is trying to use this window of opportunity in all possible ways,\u201d according to Voloshyn. Russians are trying to seize the momentum as the weather and daylight hours make conditions more conducive to ground operations. They are also in race against the clock before more arms arrive from Ukrainian partners, particularly as the West is slowly coming around to allowing Ukraine to use the weapons on Russian territory. NATO F16s are expected to arrive shortly and France has pledged to equip Ukraine wih its Mirage\u00a02000-5 fighter jets. Western weapons and a new push to draft more soldiers in to the Ukrainian military could give Ukraine the boost it needs.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/08/europe/ukraine-stabilizes-north-pressure-east-russia-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_08_style_jewel-art-music-healing-exhibition-crystal-bridges", "text": "Walking through \u201cThe Portal\u201d \u2014 the immersive art experience that I have created at Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, Arkansas \u2014 is like stepping into a mandala. It embodies my true life\u2019s work: how to heal a broken heart. Working with the team at Crystal Bridges to bring this experience to life reminded me of when I was 18 years old, and was \u201cdiscovered\u201d singing in a small coffee shop in San Diego, California. Back then, Atlantic Records president Danny Goldberg saw something in me, and decided to believe in me. An entire record label ended up rallying behind me and fought alongside me to make my first album, \u201cPieces Of You,\u201d work against all the odds. It was magic. I\u2019m now old enough to know that a person doesn\u2019t always get a magical moment in their life, much less two \u2014 I know the art world has not been sitting around hoping that a folk singer will paint. Or sculpt. Or create an experience weaving together music, behavioral health and wellness, in a fine-art museum, no less. Yet director Rod Bigelow, curator Alejo Benedetti and the entire Crystal Bridges team also chose to believe in me, and work incredibly hard to bring this vision to life. The gratitude I felt standing before the museum\u2019s front doors on opening night nearly brought me to my knees. It did bring me to tears. A journey of art, and affirmation At 40 years old, I decided to take a step back from my career. I quit touring and recording; I was a single mom coming out of a difficult divorce, and I was still recovering financially from the ruin I found myself in after my mom and I parted ways. I had no good strategy for picking myself up again and expecting a different outcome \u2014 I was waving the white flag. I surrendered to going within and learning how to heal in a new way. I created behavioral exercises; I painted and I wrote. But not for the world. For me. Art has always been a medicine I made to heal. Since I was young, I dove into journaling, poetry, and music to help myself understand the painful blows life dealt. I turned to melodies to comfort me at night when I left home at 15. I wrote many of my biggest hits during this time \u2014 songs like, \u201cAngel Standing By,\u201d \u201cHands,\u201d \u201cWho Will Save Your Soul,\u201d and \u201cYou Were Meant for Me.\u201d I also began to carve marble, mold clay and draw around the same time I began writing songs. It helped me synthesize my pain, and I found the different mediums all worked like their own unique tincture. Art is how I turned the poison into medicine, the snake bite into an antidote.\u00a0It helped me understand the world around me \u2014 and who I was independent of it, from the inside out. And so for \u201cThe Portal,\u201d I wanted to focus on that moment when I hit pause on my life, and to bring audiences on my journey from that point to today, 10 years later. It is a journey through what I call the \u201cThree Planes,\u201d a personal philosophy I\u2019ve developed centered around the idea that we each travel through three realms of reality each and every day, often without knowing it: The \u201cInner Plane,\u201d representing our thoughts and feelings; the \u201cSeen Plane,\u201d representing our physical lives \u2014 jobs, families, finances, nature, structure; and the \u201cUnseen Plane,\u201d representing whatever gives a sense of awe and wonder. For some, it\u2019s a clearly-defined spiritual belief or relationship, for others it\u2019s just a feeling, like getting goosebumps when you see images from the James Webb Space Telescope. Multidisciplinary mindfulness Walking through the experience, visitors are guided by a variety of different artworks I have selected to help them define what these realms mean to them (and to me). First, they are greeted by \u201cListen,\u201d a holographic video installation \u2014 brought to life by Protohologram, and pictured above \u2014 I designed to represent the \u201cUnseen Plane.\u201d It incorporates spoken words of a poem I wrote when I pushed that pause button and asked for help. In that moment, I felt like I was not alone. I was comforted, and I was guided to listen with my heart. In the museum\u2019s contemporary art wing, they\u2019ll see an original oil painting, called \u201cDouble Helix,\u201d representing the \u201cSeen Plane.\u201d This is the first time I have ever shown my art; to get to do so in such a prestigious museum setting is a major pinch-me moment. The painting is about my devotion to my son, and of letting go of my music career so I could be fully present for him. After my divorce, I knew my son needed me in a way that was essential \u2014 and I knew if I did not prioritize that need, I would look back and regret it. And I had faith that when it was time to re-start my creative career, I would be led to find a way forward. Here, there is also a sculpture I made titled \u201cCHILL,\u201d made of lucite and filled with a variety of medications. It represents the \u2018Inner Plane,\u2019 and is about the intersection of wellness and medicine; about longevity of life versus quality of life, and my own inner journey of learning how to unwind. Next, visitors are given a journal and invited to walk through the contemporary gallery, in which I was honored to curate 10 pieces from the museum\u2019s permanent collection. It\u2019s here \u2014 and inspired by these artworks \u2014 where I ask them to write down answers to prompts and questions that helped me heal over this past decade. One such prompt, for example is to fill in the blanks to a sentence that changed my life: \u201cI sacrifice my attachment to _____ and I dedicate it to _____.\u201d I use this prompt every day; what I have chosen to work on is sacrificing my attachment to perfectionism and dedicating it to noticing what is going right. The journal is for each visitor to keep. It has open space to draw and reflect more if they choose. One of my goals in this part of the experience was not just to help provide some structure and behavioral health tools, but to create space for community, connection and conversations.\u00a0 It was so rewarding for me to see couples, families and even strangers engaged in meaningful discussions with one another \u2014 I saw parents with tears in their eyes because they got a glimpse into their child\u2019s inner world; grown men hugging after a shared experience neither of them knew the other carried. Finally, visitors are brought outside to watch a 200-piece drone show flown by Nova Sky Stories. In the night sky, these drones create sculptural shapes, choreographed to an original 10-minute piece of music. I feel this music is the most dynamic and interesting of my career. It goes from spoken word to cinematic soundscapes,\u00a0and in and out of several new songs. Why drones? I used them because I know they have the power to create a sense of awe. There is a lot of science behind the power of awe. For me, creating this show and seeing 300 people all with their faces turned to the sky in wonder, their mouths agape, was a magical moment. It is my hope that people leave feeling more connected to themselves and those around them. What it has done for me personally is to finally allow these three areas of my life to come together in one space: to bring my music forward in a new way, to let my visual art be seen by the world for the first time, and to share the tools I\u2019ve created and used to heal. We do not heal through therapy alone. We do not heal through art alone. We do not heal through connection to self or community alone. It happens all together.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/08/style/jewel-art-music-healing-exhibition-crystal-bridges/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_10_europe_wwii-vet-marries-intl-scli", "text": "Together, the collective age of the bride and groom was nearly 200. But World War II\u00a0veteran Harold Terens\u00a0and his sweetheart Jeanne Swerlin proved that love is eternal as they tied the knot Saturday inland of the D-Day beaches in Normandy, France. Their respective ages \u2014 he\u2019s 100, she\u2019s a youngster of just 96 \u2014 made their nuptials an almost double-century celebration. Terens called it \u2033the best day of my life.\u2033 On her way\u00a0into the nuptials, the bubbly bride-to-be said: \u201cIt\u2019s not just for young people, love, you know? We get butterflies. And we get a little action, also.\u2033 The location was the elegant stone-worked town hall of Carentan, a key initial D-Day objective that saw ferocious fighting after the June 6, 1944, Allied landings that helped\u00a0rid Europe of Adolf Hitler\u2019s tyranny. Like other towns and villages across the Normandy coast where nearly 160,000 Allied troops came ashore under fire on five code-named beaches, it was an effervescent hub of remembrance and\u00a0celebration on the 80th anniversary\u00a0of the deeds and sacrifices of young men and women that day, festooned with flags and bunting and with veterans feted like rockstars. As the swing of Glenn Miller and other period tunes rang out on the streets, well-wishers \u2013 some in WWII-period clothes \u2013 were already lined up a good hour before the wedding, behind barriers outside the town hall, with a rousing pipe and drum band also on hand to serenade the happy couple. After both declaring \u201coui\u201d to vows read by Carentan\u2019s mayor in English, the couple exchanged rings. \u201cWith this ring, I thee wed,\u201d Terens said. She giggled and gasped, \u201cReally?\u201d With champagne flutes in hand, they waved through an open window to the crowds outside. \u201cTo everybody\u2019s good health. And to peace in the world and the preservation of democracy all over the world and the end of the war in Ukraine and Gaza,\u201d Terens said as he and his bride then clinked glasses and drank. The crowd yelled \u201cla mari\u00e9e!\u201d - the bride! \u2013 to Swerlin, who wore a long, flowing dress of vibrant pink. Terens looked dapper in a light-blue suit and pink kerchief in his breast pocket. And they enjoyed a very special wedding-night party: They were invited to the state dinner at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace on Saturday night with\u00a0President Emmanuel Macron and US President Joe Biden. \u201cCongratulations to the newlyweds,\u201d Macron said, prompting cheers and a standing ovation from other guests during the toast praising French-American friendship. \u201c(The town of) Carentan was happy to host your wedding, and us, your wedding dinner,\u201d he told the couple. The wedding was symbolic, not binding in law. Mayor Jean-Pierre Lhonneur\u2019s office said he wasn\u2019t empowered to wed foreigners who aren\u2019t residents of Carentan, and that the couple, who are both American, hadn\u2019t requested legally binding vows.However, they could always complete those formalities back in Florida if they wished. Lhonneur likes to say that Normandy is practically the 51st state of the US, given its reverence and gratitude for Allied soldiers and the sacrifices of tens of thousands who never made it home from the Battle of Normandy. \u201cLove is eternal, yes, maybe,\u201d the mayor said, referring to the newlyweds, although his comments also fittingly describe the feelings of many Normans for veterans. \u201cI hope for them the best happiness together.\u201d Dressed in a 1940s dress that belonged to her mother, Louise, and a red beret, 73-year-old Jane Ollier was among spectators who waited for a glimpse of the lovebirds. The couple, both widowed, grew up in New York City: she in Brooklyn, he in the Bronx. \u201cIt\u2019s so touching to get married at that age,\u2019\u2019 Ollier said. \u201cIf it can bring them happiness in the last years of their lives, that\u2019s fantastic.\u201d The WWII veteran first visited France as a 20-year-old US Army Air Forces corporal shortly after D-Day. Terens enlisted in 1942 and, after shipping to Britain, was attached to a four-pilot P-47 Thunderbolt fighter unit as their radio repair technician. On D-Day, Terens helped repair planes returning from France so they could rejoin the battle. He said half his company\u2019s pilots died that day. Terens himself went to France 12 days later, helping transport freshly captured Germans and just-freed American POWs to England. Following the Nazi surrender in May 1945, Terens again helped transport freed Allied prisoners to England before he shipped back to the US a month later. Swerlin made it abundantly clear that her new centenarian husband doesn\u2019t lack for\u00a0rizz. \u201cHe\u2019s the greatest kisser ever, you know?\u201d she proudly declared before they embraced enthusiastically for TV cameras. \u201cAll right! That\u2019s it for now !\u201d Terens said as he came up for air. To which she quipped: \u201cYou mean there\u2019s more later?\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/europe/wwii-vet-marries-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_09_middleeast_benny-gantz-resignation-post-war-plan-gaza-intl-latam", "text": "Israeli war cabinet member Benny Gantz has resigned from Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government, delivering a blow to the prime minister who has been celebrating the rare rescue of hostages held in Gaza. \u201cNetanyahu prevents us from moving forward to a real victory [in Gaza],\u201d Gantz said in a televised statement Sunday in which he described leaving the government as a \u201ccomplex and painful\u201d decision. \u201cThat is why we are leaving the emergency government today with a heavy heart, but with a whole heart,\u201d he said. Gantz \u2013 considered Netanyahu\u2019s main political challenger \u2013 said he was quitting eight-months after the October 7 Hamas attacks because \u201cthe situation in the country and in the decision-making room has changed.\u201d He accused Netanyahu of putting his own personal political considerations ahead of a post-war strategy for the Gaza Strip, claiming that \u201cfateful strategic decisions are met with hesitancy and procrastination due to political considerations,\u201d and urged the prime minister to hold an election in the coming months. \u201cI call on Netanyahu: set an agreed election date. Do not let our people be torn apart,\u201d Gantz said. The decision by Gantz fulfils an ultimatum he gave the prime minister last month calling on him to lay out a new plan for the war against Hamas by June 8. Gantz had been expected to resign on Saturday, but postponed the announcement following news that Israeli forces had rescued four hostages in an operation Gazan officials said left more than 270 Palestinians dead. His resignation comes despite Netanyahu calling on Gantz to stay in Israel\u2019s emergency government, saying this is the time for unity, not division. Following Gantz\u2019s announcement, Netanyahu urged him to change his mind. \u201cBenny, this is not the time to abandon the campaign \u2013 this is the time to join forces,\u201d Netanyahu said to Gantz in a post on X. \u201cCitizens of Israel, we will continue until victory and all the goals of the war have been achieved, most importantly, the release of all our hostages and the elimination of Hamas,\u201d Netanyahu said. Netanyahu said his door remained open to any political party that is ready to share in the burden of fighting the war against Hamas, and will \u201chelp bring victory over our enemies and ensure the security of our citizens.\u201d Gantz\u2019s decision does not put Netanyahu\u2019s government in immediate danger \u2013 his party was not part of the prime minister\u2019s coalition, which retains a majority with 64-seats in the 120-member Knesset, Israel\u2019s parliament. It would however leave the war cabinet, set up four days after Hamas\u2019 October 7 attack, without representation from any party other than Netanyahu\u2019s Likud. Besides the prime minister, the only other remaining member of the emergency government with decision-making power is Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, also from Likud. (Though following Gantz\u2019s announcement, the far-right Israeli National Security Minister Ben Gvir demanded to join the war cabinet). Gantz\u2019 decision comes as Netanyahu faces growing calls from Israel\u2019s Western allies and families of hostages held in Gaza to end the war and bring back the captives. Eight months since the war started, Israel is yet to achieve its stated objectives as most of Hamas\u2019 top leadership remains at large and more than 100 hostages are held in the enclave. The United States has repeatedly called on the prime minister to present a tangible post-war plan for Gaza. US President Joe Biden, who laid out a three-pronged Israeli peace deal proposal last week, has suggested that Netanyahu is likely benefiting from prolonging the conflict. Gantz, a 64-year-old former defense minister, said last month that Netanyahu should submit a plan that should include the elimination of Hamas, the return of hostages from Gaza, the establishment of an alternative government in the enclave, the return of displaced Israelis from the north of the country, and a plan to make progress on normalization with Saudi Arabia. Netanyahu had rejected Gantz\u2019s threat, saying his ultimatum would harm Israel. In April, Gantz called for early elections to be held as soon as September, ahead of the one-year anniversary of the war, saying \u201cIsraeli society needs to renew its contract with its leadership.\u201d Gantz often surpasses the prime minister in popularity, according to opinion polls. A survey published Friday by the Israeli Maariv newspaper showed support for Gantz at 42%, compared to 34% for Netanyahu. The war cabinet, which Gantz was a member of, operates independently from the broader Israeli government. It is responsible for making decisions related to the fighting in Gaza. \u201cHe (Gantz) joined the government four days after October 7 in order to balance things out with the far right, prevent reckless decision-making,\u201d Alon Pinkas, a former Israeli diplomat, wrote in Israel\u2019s Haaretz newspaper. \u201cIn his mind, he was the responsible adult in a government filled with inept and messianic misfits.\u201d As the war dragged on, with displaced residents of northern Israel unable to return home and hostages remaining captive in Gaza, Gantz may have realized he would lose popularity by staying in the cabinet, Pinkas said. \u201cThe longer Gantz remains in the government, the weaker Gantz will get,\u201d Pinkas wrote. \u201cThe more identical his positions are to those of the prime minister, the more he\u2019ll lose on both sides. Right-wingers will return home and centrists will seek other options.\u201d This is a developing story. More to come.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/09/middleeast/benny-gantz-resignation-post-war-plan-gaza-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_weather_tornado-maryland-dc", "text": "Damaging storms and tornadoes hit parts of at least three states, including a Washington, DC, suburb Wednesday, killing at least one person and injuring others. A tornado ripped through the Detroit suburb of Livonia, Michigan, during the afternoon and toppled a tree onto a home, killing a 2-year-old and severely injuring the child\u2019s mother. \u201cThis is a terrible tragedy for our community,\u201d Livonia Mayor Maureen Miller Brosnan said in a\u00a0news release. \u201cOur hearts are broken, too, and we send our deepest sympathies.\u201d The storm that tracked through Livonia tore a 5.5-mile path and was rated an EF1 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale, with peak winds of 95 mph, according to a preliminary survey from the National Weather Service in Detroit.  Storms intensified as they tracked through West Virginia and Maryland Wednesday evening and produced more than 10 reports of tornadoes in the two states. A tornado tracking through the Washington, DC, suburb of Gaithersburg, Maryland, trapped five people in a ranch-style home after it collapsed in the storm. One person was taken to a hospital with traumatic injuries, Montgomery County Fire and Rescue Assistant Chief David Pazos told CNN. Two other homes in the densely packed suburb with about 70,000 residents were significantly damaged by trees, according to the fire department\u2019s chief spokesperson Pete Piringer. Several people were removed from damaged structures and transported to hospitals, emergency officials said. At least seven tornadoes have been confirmed in the Baltimore area, with notable tornadoes in both Montgomery\u00a0County and Baltimore County receiving EF1 ratings after reaching winds of 105 mph, the National Weather Service said. A tornado was also seen near Baltimore, in Arbutus, Maryland at around 8:55 p.m. ET, the National Weather Service office there said. Details about what damage that tornado caused, if any, to structures were not immediately available. The US Storm Prediction Center said numerous trees and power lines were down in the area. In the Sykesville, Maryland, area, there were no immediate reports of injuries but at least 10 structures were damaged, mostly by the high winds, according to fire department spokesperson Bill Rehkopf. One was significantly damaged by a tree. Survey teams with the National Weather Service are visiting the hard-hit areas to assess the damage to determine how many tornadoes there were and how strong they were. Weak tornadoes are not uncommon in the DC region, but only a handful in recorded history have been EF3 or stronger. In 2002, an EF4 tornado devastated parts of La Plata, Maryland, south of DC. That storm killed three people and caused more than $100 million in damage, according to data from the National Weather Service. Tornadoes were also seen in Alabama and Ohio as storms across the country exceeded forecast expectations. A possible tornado also caused damage in Frazeysburg, Ohio, around 50 miles east of Columbus. Photos show debris littered streets, snapped power poles and some partially collapsed structures. Nine people were injured, including at least four taken to a nearby hospital, according to CNN affiliate WBNS.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/weather/tornado-maryland-dc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "world"}}

Rescue operations have ended and authorities will investigate what caused the crash in the city of Pardubice, police said Thursday. About 380 people were traveling aboard the passenger train, the Fire Rescue Service said. It was traveling overnight from Prague to the city of Chop in western Ukraine, according to operator RegioJet\u2019s website. CNN has reached out to RegioJet for comment.

{"id": "2024_06_05_africa_jacob-zuma-comeback-south-africa-elections-intl", "text": "South Africa\u2019s African National Congress (ANC) party faces a mammoth challenge as it needs to form a government with its political rivals after suffering a seismic blow in last week\u2019s election. On Wednesday, the ANC\u2019s national spokesperson insisted that any coalition government would be in the interests of unity and stability and hinted at a government of national unity of some kind. \u201cThe ANC has taken the position that we must all act in the interest of our country and its people, and work on a national consensus on the form of government that is best suited to move South Africa forward at this moment in our history,\u201d Mahlengi Bhengu-Motsiri told a press briefing. Still, some of the same parties that sought the ANC\u2019s demise will now have to play a part in governing South Africa. For decades, the ANC could rule alone, but support for the the party plummeted to around 40% in last Wednesday\u2019s elections, down from 57% in 2019. Analysts and opinion polls had forecast losses for the ANC but a pivotal factor in the party\u2019s staggering decline was former President Jacob Zuma and his newly formed uMkhonto weSizwe (MK) party, which capitalized on widespread discontent within the ANC\u2019s traditional voter base. Zuma\u2019s revenge Zuma \u2013 a fierce critic of current ANC leader and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa \u2013 was forced to resign as president in 2018 and has been looking for political revenge ever since. His MK party, named after the ANC\u2019s former armed wing, appears to have achieved just that \u2013 formed just five months ago, it is now the third-largest party in South Africa, receiving almost 15% of the vote. Zuma positioned MK as \u201ca party that is meant to restore the ANC to its former glory,\u201d said political analyst Tessa Dooms, programmes director at the Rivonia Circle non-profit organization/political think tank in Johannesburg. She says many MK voters saw this ballot as a protest vote. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen with the MK party is the use of a vote to send a signal to the ANC of the level of unhappiness, not only of the country itself but within its ranks who\u2019ve supported it over the last 30 years,\u201d Dooms told CNN. Despite Zuma being barred from running for parliament by the Constitutional Court because of a previous contempt of court violation, the 82-year-old\u2019s\u00a0face remained on the ballot paper. Zuma is no stranger to controversy or the courtroom. He\u202fhas faced\u202fhundreds of corruption, fraud and racketeering charges\u202fover the years. He has always denied all of them and became known as the \u201cTeflon President\u201d because few politicians could have survived the scandals he weathered. Ramaphosa replaced him as president when Zuma was finally forced to resign. Later revelations of \u201cstate capture\u201d \u2013 or rampant corruption riveted the nation in an anti-corruption commission. Much of the focus was on Zuma\u2019s relationship with the influential and wealthy Gupta brothers. With the ANC\u2019s popularity now at an all-time low and as Ramaphosa\u2019s political future hangs in the balance, Zuma could have the last laugh. But it is too early to tell. Due to the poor election showing, South Africa\u2019s political landscape has been fundamentally altered, leaving the ANC with the daunting task of forming a coalition government. In many countries, coalition talks can take months, but South Africa\u2019s constitution gives rival parties a short window to do something they have never really done before: come together. According to the constitution, rival parties have a mere 14 days to create a coalition after the final election results are announced. The outcome of these talks will likely\u00a0determine Ramaphosa\u2019s future as president. Ramaphosa\u2019s\u00a0allies\u00a0in the party are digging in. On Sunday, ANC Secretary-General Fikile Mbalula warned potential coalition partners that the president\u2019s resignation is \u201cnot going to happen.\u201d \u201cI think the ANC has many factors to consider in terms of how it forms a government \u2013 both the stability of the country at large but also for the sake of having a government that still holds to the values of the ANC that it has long said that it serves,\u201d Dooms told CNN. The potential coalition partners present starkly different political ideologies and policy priorities. A marriage of convenience First, there is the official opposition Democratic Alliance (DA), a broadly centrist and pro-business party that has heavily criticized the ANC for many years. Led by John Steenhuisen, it is seen by many\u00a0as a party for White South Africans, something the DA rejects. Steenhuisen has not ruled out going into a coalition with the ANC. A DA-ANC alliance, however it would form, would likely keep Ramaphosa in his job, say analysts. \u201cThe only way Ramaphosa stays is through a DA-ANC coalition.\u00a0Outside that,\u00a0the other parties, MK and EFF\u00a0(Economic Freedom Fighters), have made it clear the first point of negotiation is he must go,\u201d said TK Pooe, a senior lecturer at Wits School of Governance. If the ANC were to pair with the DA, which\u202freceived 21.8% of the vote, their combined support would amount to more than 60%, an outright majority. However, this relationship would require both parties to make some major compromises. While in government, the ANC\u2019s flagship policy for driving economic inclusion and racial equality in post-apartheid South Africa has been its Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment policy, known as triple-BEE or simply BEE. The\u202fBEE policy has been criticized\u202fby some as neither broad-based, nor empowering. In contrast, the DA has\u202fsaid\u202fit would replace BEE with an \u201cEconomic Justice Policy\u201d that \u201ctargets the poor black majority for redress, rather than a small, connected elite.\u201d The DA is also against the ANC\u2019s flagship National Health Insurance Act (NIH) in its current form. The act, which was signed into law two weeks before the election, seeks to provide universal health care for all and gradually limit the role of private health insurers. However, both parties believe in the primacy of South Africa\u2019s constitution and both have promised to crack down on corruption. Awkwardly, the DA is currently\u202fpressing corruption charges\u202fagainst the ANC\u2019s deputy president,\u00a0Paul Mashatile. In a move to appease internal critics, the ANC-DA coalition could be expanded to include smaller parties, or the ANC could form a minority government with a \u201cconfidence-and-supply\u201d agreement with opposition partners like the DA and the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), where they remain outside of government but support it on key votes in exchange for policy concessions. A bitter pill to swallow? If the ANC decides\u00a0to pursue coalition talks with MK, then Zuma will want Ramaphosa out, solidifying his revenge. However, if South Africa\u2019s president maintains his grip on the ANC, a coalition with MK is unlikely. The MK party\u2019s manifesto also\u00a0demands an overhaul of the country\u2019s constitution to restore more powers to traditional leaders. Zuma \u201cunapologetically focused his campaign around Zulu nationalism and that was a constituency that was easy for him to target,\u201d\u202fpolitical\u00a0analyst and former ANC\u00a0lawmaker\u00a0Melanie Verwoerd told CNN. By appealing to his Zulu base, Zuma\u2019s party has also stirred ethnic and tribal tensions, a strategy that, while electorally effective, risks deepening divisions in South Africa, Verwoerd added. The ANC\u2019s policies, grounded in the principles of non-racial and non-tribal governance, are at odds with this approach. It is also currently unclear how much MK actually wants to govern. Despite doing well at the polls, the party has demanded a re-run, threatened court action, and suggested boycotting the first sitting of Parliament. However,\u00a0it has provided no evidence of\u00a0voting\u00a0irregularities. The other option for a coalition is the EFF,\u00a0led by former ANC youth leader Julius Malema, who was expelled from the party more than a decade ago. The breakaway party espouses land expropriation without compensation and sweeping state nationalism, including nationalizing the Reserve Bank. Malema has said\u202fhe would give the EFF vote to the ANC on the condition that his deputy, Floyd Shivambu, becomes Minister of Finance in an effort to control fiscal policy. South Africa\u2019s business community and middle class are broadly nervous about an EFF\u2013ANC coalition and its effect on investor confidence. The DA calls it part of a\u00a0\u201cdoomsday\u201d option because of the potential impact on investment and trade. The EFF won just under 10% of the vote, so any coalition with the ANC would need to include at least another party in the mix to give it a healthy majority. The IFP, with almost 4% of the vote, could be such a kingmaker. Aside from a classic coalition deal or a \u201cconfidence and supply\u201d agreement, another hypothetical option on the table would be a \u201cgovernment of national unity\u201d (GNU), bringing in all the major parties. This scenario would hark back to the post-apartheid era when South Africa operated under a GNU to oversee the new constitution,\u00a0led by Mandela as president and FW de Klerk and Thabo Mbeki as deputy presidents,\u00a0between April 1994 and February 1997. With less than two weeks\u00a0to finalize coalition agreements, South Africa\u2019s political future remains uncertain; the ANC must navigate this complex landscape to form a stable government and address the challenges that have led to its diminished support, while Ramaphosa\u2019s leadership hangs in the balance amidst Zuma\u2019s dramatic comeback.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/africa/jacob-zuma-comeback-south-africa-elections-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "world"}}

Rice and Southern Methodist University player Theodore Knox are now both facing charges of one count of aggravated assault, one count of collision involving serious bodily injury and six counts of collision involving injury, according to Dallas police. While speaking to reporters on Saturday at a youth football camp in Kansas City, the 24-year-old Rice said: \u201cI\u2019ve learned so much from that. All I can do is mature and continue to grow from that. This is a step in a better direction for me.\u201d Dallas police had issued arrest warrants for Rice and\u00a0Knox after a Corvette and a Lamborghini crashed in the far-left lane of the North Central Expressway on March 31. Both men later turned themselves in to local police. Six vehicles in total were involved in the crash, authorities said. \u201cThe Lamborghini traveled onto the shoulder and hit the center median wall, causing a chain reaction collision involving four other vehicles,\u201d spokesperson Kristin Lowman told CNN. \u201cThe occupants of the Lamborghini and the Corvette all ran from the scene without stopping to determine if anyone needed medical help or providing their information.\u201d Rice\u2019s attorney has said his client\u00a0was driving the Lamborghini. Dallas police\u00a0confirmed that\u00a0and said Knox was driving the Corvette. Players convicted of a crime are subject to discipline under the NFL\u2019s personal conduct policy.

In four playoff games, he added another 26 catches for 262 yards and a touchdown, setting the rookie record for receptions in one postseason.

{"id": "2024_06_10_style_photographer-juergen-teller-the-myth", "text": "After having sex, some women hoping to get pregnant will immediately raise their legs up high, for a few minutes or longer, in the hope that gravity will assist conception. Though the impact of such contortion is not actually grounded in science, it persists as a familiar trope in movies and TV, and has long been passed down generationally as fertility lore. So when photographer Juergen Teller and his wife and creative partner Dovile Drizyte were trying for a baby while on vacation in Sicily two years ago, Teller recommended the practise. \u201cI said to Dovile, \u2018It\u2019s a better chance to get pregnant afterwards, if you put your legs up,\u2019\u201d he recalled in a joint video interview with CNN. With another couple, the suggestion might have just resulted in a quick Google search and a laugh over the old wives\u2019 tale. But for Teller and Drizyte, who have had a fruitful artistic collaboration for the past few years \u2014 including, recently, their now 1-year-old daughter Iggy recreating her dad\u2019s most famous fashion shoots \u2014 the exchange led to a tongue-in-cheek body of work. Now a published book, \u201cThe Myth\u201d is a portrait series featuring a nude Drizyte set against the 94 rooms of the neoclassical and art deco Grand Hotel Villa Serbelloni in Lake Como, Italy. Against damask wallpaper, ornate gold bedframes and plush chaise longues, Drizyte\u2019s legs rise in every photograph. She splays out on beds and floors, balances herself on small chairs, and overlooks the picturesque views of the mountainous region from atop a balcony table, all with her feet hovering in midair. As they explored the villa, they were delighted to find symbols of fertility, femininity and motherhood in the hotel\u2019s art collection. From Madonna and Child icons to baptismal scenes to sensual nude drawings, the works became a throughline in the \u201cThe Myth.\u201d \u201cIt was a very interesting surprise \u2014 it seemed like the hotel was helping us with the project,\u201d Drizyte said. What lies ahead In each frame Drizyte is seemingly post-coital, though she noted that it was important for none of the poses to look sexualized. \u201cIt was more (about) waiting for the baby,\u201d she explained of the compositions. \u201cWhat is coming? What is approaching? \u2026Of course, there\u2019s a bit of humor because you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen; your life really changes.\u201d \u201cDovile had to be very serene,\u201d Teller added, emphasizing how mentally \u2014 and for Drizyte, physically \u2014 exhausting the five-day shoot was as they entered each hotel room to decide on a new variation of the scene. By the time they had arranged the shoot with the hotel, Drizyte was already pregnant \u2014 and starting to show, adding \u201ca bit of time pressure\u201d to the project, she said. Teller had previously stayed in the villa, even photographing a 2019 campaign for YSL there (also with a focus on legs, albeit in sheer hosiery), and the owners enthusiastically gave them free rein as staff prepared to close for the off-season, the photographer explained. \u201cWe became a part of the hotel going into hibernation,\u201d Drizyte recalled. \u201cThe maids were coming and cleaning these rooms and taking beds out.\u201d \u201cGuests disappeared and it became more ghostlike,\u201d Teller added. \u201cIt was wonderful, romantic and beautiful.\u201d He added that the experience helped them concentrate and think about what laid ahead for them as parents. Despite the fact that becoming pregnant was straightforward for Drizyte,\u00a0she emphasized how much of it is luck. \u201cIt\u2019s like a lottery, almost, whether it\u2019s all quick and easy, or it takes longer, or there are complications,\u201d she said. \u201cYou start really believing and asking or praying or contemplating\u2026 (or putting) your legs up \u2014 surely that helps?\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/style/photographer-juergen-teller-the-myth/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_07_asia_japan-host-club-debt-exploitation-intl-hnk-dst", "text": "Yu felt a rush of excitement as she walked into his bar for the first time \u2013 eager to meet the charming young host she\u2019d been following for years online. On that cold January night last year, they chatted over champagne \u2013 the first of many meetings that would have Yu fast falling in love. Yu, 41, a clinician and divorced mother of two, soon began spending every spare minute with him at the bar in Tokyo\u2019s main red-light district, dropping thousands of dollars on heavily marked-up alcohol. In return, he showered Yu with attention and small gifts, celebrating her birthday with her and even promising to buy her a ring. \u201cHe said, \u2018You are my girlfriend,\u2019\u201d said Yu, who CNN is identifying by a pseudonym to protect her privacy. \u201cI believed him.\u201d Yu says the host, handsome and in his 20s, encouraged her to run up a bar tab that quickly spiraled out of control. Then, her money ran out \u2013 and everything changed. With no way for Yu to pay the 25 million yen (about $165,000) she owed to the bar, he said he would take care of the debt. But now she would have to repay him \u2013 with sex work the only way to raise the cash. Yu is one of hundreds of women coerced to sell their bodies after frequenting Japan\u2019s so-called \u201chost clubs,\u201d experts told CNN. There are more than 300 of these venues in Tokyo\u2019s neon-lit Kabukicho district, offering male companionship to lonely women. Though not all hosts exploit their female clients, authorities say some clubs are linked to organized crime, while activists say loose regulation of the industry has allowed abuse to fester. Under current laws, anybody over the age of 18 can enter the clubs, and efforts by lawmakers to introduce stronger protections have so far failed. Cases of extreme debt, exploitation and sex trafficking surged after Covid restrictions were lifted in 2023, activists say, with women flocking to host clubs following several years of business closures and isolation. Last year, Tokyo police arrested 140 people for alleged prostitution in Kabukicho, according to public broadcaster NHK \u2013 a threefold increase from the previous year. Of those detained, 40% told police they were soliciting to repay debts run up at host clubs, NHK reported. With such cases mounting, authorities set up helplines for victims and arrested hosts for allegedly coercing indebted customers into sex work. In December, Tokyo police inspected 176 host clubs in Kabukicho, NHK reported \u2013 finding regulatory violations in 75% of the venues, mainly for not clearly displaying the price of alcohol and for placing menus out of sight. \u201cIt\u2019s a romance scam, basically,\u201d said Ayaka Shiomura, a member of Japan\u2019s upper house of parliament, who has unsuccessfully pushed for better safeguards against exploitative host clubs. \u201cSome of these women are brainwashed into thinking they\u2019re dating these hosts. It\u2019s a vicious, bad cycle.\u201d The price of love For many victims, that cycle begins online, especially on social media \u2013 where hosts built their fanbase when pandemic restrictions forced their clubs to close. Mikami Rui, 28, has worked as a host for the past 10 years \u2013 and says for much of his career, the clubs weren\u2019t very well known. But \u201cawareness is spreading in Japan\u201d because of platforms like Instagram, TikTok and X, where hosts are \u201cworking very hard to become more visible,\u201d he said. While he insists he has never forced a customer into sex work, he admits to previously persuading women to spend far beyond their means. Now, he claims, \u201cI entertain women without pressuring them for money \u2026 I stick to what they can afford.\u201d On these apps, hosts identify and flirt with prospective customers to entice them to visit the clubs, said Hidemori Gen, an advocate in Tokyo who provides a drop-in consultation service for victims of sexual abuse and gang violence. Often, hosts target vulnerable young women, draining them of their savings and then coercing them into sex work to repay their bar debts, Gen said. Yu had watched the host\u2019s YouTube videos for two years before going to his club \u2013 that first meeting laying the groundwork for a one-sided relationship of false promises. After that night, he reached out asking to see her again \u2013 so Yu visited the club once more. Soon, he was treating her at restaurants and hookah bars, paying her special attention \u201cover other girls,\u201d she said. He talked about going to the places she wanted to visit, like Disneyland or Japan\u2019s popular island destination Okinawa. This kind of special attention is why victims \u2013 some as young as 18 \u2013 often genuinely believe the hosts are their boyfriends, said Shiomura, the national assembly member. Hosts may have sex with their customers \u201cearly on\u201d to establish intimacy, saying things like \u201cI love you\u201d and \u201clet\u2019s get married\u201d \u2013 some even going as far as meeting the women\u2019s parents, she said. The whole time, Yu was racking up bills she couldn\u2019t pay. Host clubs often offer steep discounts for new customers, luring them in with cheap drinks then jacking up the prices once they\u2019re hooked \u2013 with some bottles of alcohol costing as much as $6,000. Many hosts also encourage clients to keep their bar tab open for weeks at a time \u2013 which is how debts can balloon out of sight. \u201cHe asked me, \u2018How are you going to pay me back?\u2019 and when I said I didn\u2019t know, he said, \u2018Go abroad for sex work,\u2019\u201d Yu said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to. But he said it was the only way and that I could make 8 million yen (about $53,000) a month.\u201d Desperate and depleted of her savings, Yu began working as a prostitute in Japan and the Chinese territories of Macao and Hong Kong. It didn\u2019t feel like she had a choice, she said. \u201cWe worked 10-hour-plus shifts. Every hour, there was a show and I would get picked, then bought. It made me really sad to see about 100 girls, including myself, be bought,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen my body was exhausted or I felt weak, I thought it\u2019d be easier to die. I thought about that a lot.\u201d Overcome with shame and anger at herself, she didn\u2019t tell friends or family about her predicament. Shiomura, the lawmaker, said even when being exploited, many women still view the hosts as their boyfriends and want to support them. \u201cI think it tells you how this mind control runs deep,\u201d she said. No regulations, no relief Gen, who runs the consultation service for abuse victims, says he has seen a fivefold increase of cases like Yu\u2019s in the past year alone. \u201cLast spring, when we came out of the pandemic and the masks came off, that\u2019s when consultations about host clubs increased dramatically,\u201d he said. And laws lag the surge in cases, allowing exploitative host clubs to continue their shady practices. Shiomura last year proposed a bill in parliament that called for government investigations, public awareness campaigns, counseling services and employment assistance for victims. Rejected by the ruling party, the bill failed to pass, with some critics arguing female customers bear responsibility for visiting host clubs and spending irresponsibly. That means it\u2019s largely up to hosts and host clubs to self-regulate \u2013 which some have promised to do.\u00a0Since April, more than a dozen host club operators in Tokyo \u2013 each owning several venues \u2013 said they would refuse entry to women under the legal drinking age of 20 and prevent customers from running up massive debts. Rui, the host, welcomed the measure, saying clubs that break the guidelines should be shut down. But there are far more clubs beyond those owned by the 13 operators that have pledged to follow the new self-imposed rules \u2013 and no such commitment on a national level. Even within Tokyo, Shiomura voiced doubts about whether clubs would honor their promises, and said she would resubmit the rejected bill if the problem continued. \u201cA lot of people say that it is the woman\u2019s self-responsibility. But I wouldn\u2019t dare think that,\u201d she said. \u201cI think there\u2019s a problem with Japanese society that looks at the bodies of such young women, young women in their teens and 20s, as products.\u201d And there is little relief for victims whose lives have already been upended. Yu is no longer seeing the host, who she says released her from her debt after she\u2019d paid back most of it. But with bills to cover and heavy credit card debt, she still feels trapped. \u201cI\u2019m still doing sex work because I can\u2019t afford to leave. I don\u2019t want to do this work. I feel like I\u2019m going to fall apart,\u201d Yu said. \u201cI\u2019ve hit rock bottom. I don\u2019t know if I can start over again.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/asia/japan-host-club-debt-exploitation-intl-hnk-dst/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "world"}}

Walt Disney World\u2019s new ride, inspired by the movie \u201cThe Princess and the Frog\u201d and its heroine Tiana, is currently in preview mode for groups including employees and annual passholders and has already elicited mixed reactions in the midst of the culture wars. The structure of the log-flume ride has not changed, but the theme has been completely redone four years after Disney first announced the project in 2020, during the same season of nationwide protests over the death of George Floyd. The original Splash Mountain ride \u2014 which first opened at Disneyland in 1989, and at Disney World and Tokyo Disneyland in 1992 \u2014 was based on characters from \u201cSong of the South,\u201d a 1946 Disney movie that has long been criticized as racist for its stereotypical portrayals of African Americans and a romanticized view of the antebellum South. Turning Splash Mountain into Tiana\u2019s Bayou Adventure is also happening at Disneyland in Anaheim, California, with an opening date yet to be announced. Tokyo Disneyland is also home to a Splash Mountain ride, but the theme in that location is not changing. Disney has kept \u201cSong of the South\u201d from being re-released and has even kept the movie off its streaming platform, Disney+. \u2018It\u2019s finally happened\u2019 Victoria Wade, a theme park content creator, got to try Tiana\u2019s Bayou Adventure in early June as a guest of an employee. Wade, who is Black, told CNN it was powerful to finally experience a Disney attraction where the characters look like her. \u201cI got very emotional immediately towards the finale scene of the ride in particular\u2026 it was just nice to be seen,\u201d\u00a0she said. She added that she would have loved to see that kind of representation when she was a child. For her little cousins and the children she babysits, \u201cThey can just go there and see themselves in a positive light \u2014 in a positive representation. So it just, it warmed my heart. It was just like, finally, we had to beg for all these years for this to happen. And it\u2019s finally happened.\u201d Wade said she found the scenes colorful and vibrant, and she could tell how much the Disney team had researched\u00a0Louisiana culture to create the new theme. \u201cYou can even see bits and pieces of that within the queue,\u201d Wade said, referring to the area where riders wait in line and see fictional letters written during World War I, when Princess Tiana\u2019s father, James, served in the military. In a blog post, Disney has said \u201cthe photos that served as reference for the expanded backstory of James were those of soldiers who served in 369th Regiment, one of the first African American regiments to serve with the American Expeditionary Forces during World War I. This unit was renowned for its bravery and many members were awarded the prestigious Croix de Guerre medal by the French government for their valiant service in action.\u201d That reference had special significance for Disney\u2019s project lead Charita Carter, whose father served in the US Air Force. She and a team of Disney staff had visited New Orleans to create an authentic visual style for the ride. They met with Stella Reese Chase, whose mother Leah Chase was a renowned New Orleans chef and TV personality. Chase visited Walt Disney Imagineering in April alongside CNN and other media\u00a0to see this ride\u2019s advanced animatronics, the likes of which had yet to debut in a US Disney park. As Chase watched Princess Tiana wave and talk for the first time in 3D, she said, \u201cI\u2019m just amazed, you know. What can I say? I\u2019ve never seen anything like it. This is really a wild experience.\u201d Lukewarm waters While fans have agreed that the new technology on the ride, including projection mapping and the fluidity of characters\u2019 movements, is far superior to the prior version, criticism has centered around lack of plot. Disney has said that the ride\u2019s story takes place chronologically after the movie ends and involves Princess Tiana inviting guests to a big celebration in the bayou. Jack Kendall, host of the theme park fan podcast DSNY, also experienced the new ride recently as a guest of an employee. He said that for an attraction based on the suspense of a 50-foot drop, \u201cthere\u2019s no kind of antagonist within the attraction to have that kind of push and pull of that trepidation building up the lift hill and going down the other side,\u201d noting that people are saying \u201cthere\u2019s no real story to it.\u201d Kendall added, \u201cTo be honest, it\u2019s a lovely collection of scenes, of show scenes, very beautifully put together, but there\u2019s not really much of an impetus for why we\u2019re going on this journey now.\u201d Big drop into the culture wars But online vitriol has sometimes gone far beyond the merits of the ride. Several petitions on change.org over the years have attempted to \u201csave\u201d Splash Mountain. One such petition organized by Eric Thibeault stated: \u201cIt is absurd to pander to a small group of \u2018Disney haters\u2019 that dont [sic] understand the story, and re-theme such a nostalgic ride. The characters in Splash Mountain do not specifically generalize any race or group of people, they are nothing more than caricatures based on the turn-of-the-century America. \u201cModifying Splash Mountain will not change history and will only encourage the \u2018easily offended\u2019 to continue making desperate attempts at finding offence in additional attractions.\u201d Disney has rethemed or modified old rides before, garnering similar attention from fans who resisted change. In recent years, for example, a woman in red featured in a Pirates of the Caribbean ride scene was changed from a wench \u201cfor sale\u201d to a pistol-carrying pirate. Kendall said that the opening of the rethemed ride\u00a0is a culmination of the culture wars in which the Disney company has been entangled over the last several years, including a battle with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis over a controversial bill that restricts certain instruction about sexual orientation and gender identity in the classroom. He said he thinks that those who were upset at losing the Splash Mountain theme had largely already decided they would dislike the new theme. \u201cIf you took the attraction of Tiana\u2019s Bayou Adventure, all the theming, all the scenes, all the technology behind it, and put it in its own new attraction building, people wouldn\u2019t be speaking about this attraction like they are,\u201d Kendall\u00a0said. \u201cThey\u2019d be saying it\u2019s fantastic. One of the best things that Disney\u2019s done \u2026 But it\u2019s because it\u2019s being somewhat unfairly compared to what was there before. So I think that\u2019s where a lot of this online discourse is coming from.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/tiana-bayou-adventure-disney-world/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_09_europe_european-parliament-far-right-surge-intl", "text": "Far-right parties are predicted to win a record number of seats in the European Parliament, a result that, if confirmed, would deliver a stinging rebuke to Brussels\u2019 political mainstream and add uncertainty to Europe\u2019s future direction. After three days of voting across the European Union\u2019s 27 member states, an exit poll showed that far-right parties were set to win around 150 of the parliament\u2019s 720 seats, which will likely make it harder for mainstream parties to form majorities needed to pass laws. In a speech late Sunday, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the results showed her European People\u2019s Party (EPP) \u2013 predicted to secure the most seats \u2013 could still act as an \u201canchor of stability,\u201d but called on her political allies to help guard against extremist parties. \u201cThe center is holding. But it is also true that the extremes on the left and on the right have gained support, and this is why the result comes with great responsibility for the parties in the center,\u201d she told an audience in Brussels. The full results will trickle in on Monday, when the process of coalition-building will begin as Europe\u2019s centrists seek to put aside their differences to see off a resurgent far right. Most of the far-right gains were concentrated in countries that elect large numbers of seats: France, Italy and Germany. After an exit poll showed Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Rally (RN) party is expected to trounce his own candidates, French President Emmanuel Macron dissolved his parliament and called a risky snap election, with the first round on June 30. RN won 36.8% of the vote, according to official results from the French Interior Ministry on Monday, followed by Macron\u2019s pro-European list on 14.6% and the center-left Socialist Party with 13.8%. In a celebratory speech at the RN headquarters before Macron\u2019s shock announcement, party leader Jordan Bardella said the \u201cunprecedented defeat for the current government marks the end of a cycle, and Day 1 of the post-Macron era.\u201d Like Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz also suffered a stinging blow in the exit poll, as his Social Democrats (SD) scored their worst-ever result of 14%, while the mainstream Christian Democrats Party (CDU) came top with 29.5% of the vote and the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) came second with 16.5%. While the results will shape the political direction of the EU for the next five years, this cluster of national elections is often seen as a de facto referendum on the incumbent domestic governments, which could spell trouble for Macron in France\u2019s 2027 presidential election and for Scholz in Germany\u2019s federal elections next year. A lot has changed in Europe since the last parliamentary elections in 2019, after Britain left the bloc in 2020 and Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, putting much of the continent on a war footing as it sought to send desperately needed supplies to Kyiv and member states shored up their own defenses. \u201cOf course, this election does not take place in a vacuum. The world around us is in turmoil. Forces from the outside and from the inside are trying to destabilize our societies, and they are trying to weaken Europe,\u201d von der Leyen said. While the far-right surge may further complicate Brussels\u2019 bid for unity, the far-right parties themselves remain relatively divided. The AfD is politically homeless: it was removed from the far-right Identity and Democracy (ID) party after its main European candidate, Maximilian Krah, said he did not consider all members of the Nazi group the SS to be criminals. Several other far-right parties are among the non-aligned (NI) group, predicted to secure 45 seats. Responding to the exit poll, Roberta Metsola, president of the European Parliament, said the results showed Brussels\u2019 political establishment needed to \u201cunderstand how people voted\u201d and take decisions \u201cthat have an impact on citizens\u2019 daily lives.\u201d \u201cWe can see that the constructive, pro-European center has held,\u201d she said, but stressed there remains \u201ca responsibility of the groups to come together to form a majority.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/09/europe/european-parliament-far-right-surge-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "world"}}

The Panthers took the Game 1 with a commanding 3-0 victory at home. The Oilers had their chances to get back into the game and outshot Florida 32-18, but Panthers goaltender Sergei Bobrovsky made 32 saves to leave Edmonton scoreless in Game 1.

{"id": "2024_06_08_travel_teton-pass-crack-landslide-collapse", "text": " The major highway near Grand Teton National Park that was closed after a \u201ccatastrophic\u201d collapse Saturday could partially reopen in a matter of weeks, according to the Wyoming Department of Transportation. \u201cCurrently, WYDOT geologists and engineers are confident they can build a safe, temporary detour around the slide area using local fill material and paving two temporary lanes,\u201d the agency\u00a0announced\u00a0Monday. \u201cThey are hoping to have a temporary detour open to the public, likely with some strict weight and width restrictions, in a few weeks.\u201d The transportation department says there is still no firm timeline for when construction on permanent repairs could begin on the critical highway linking Idaho and Wyoming. Road crews are simultaneously working to clear a mudslide on the same highway, about two miles from the landslide. The initial crack appeared Thursday morning across both lanes of travel, the department said\u00a0in a\u00a0post\u00a0on Facebook at the time. The crack across lanes dropped vertically roughly 8 inches in some places, causing unsafe driving conditions.\u00a0A patch was put in place and traffic resumed until a mudslide in a different location on Friday closed the road. Saturday morning, the roadway where the initial crack happened collapsed, the department\u00a0said, adding the roadway had \u201ccatastrophically failed, and a long term closure is expected.\u201d \u201cWYDOT crews, along with contract crews from Evans Construction, were working in the area to construct a detour around the damage, but the landslide continued to move, taking out the whole road,\u201d the department said Saturday\ufeff. \u201cNo crews were hurt in the process, and no equipment was damaged.\u201d Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon said Saturday he had met with the transportation department and Wyoming Office of Homeland Security officials to coordinate a response to the \u201ccatastrophic landslide.\u201d \u201cI am grateful for the efforts of WYDOT staff to protect public safety during this developing situation, and am thankful no one was injured during this incident,\u201d the governor said. Work to repair the cracked roadway and mudslide had been anticipated to last into Saturday, according to the department, and then the cracked section of the roadway collapsed. \u201cWYDOT engineers, surveyors and geologists mobilized quickly to try to maintain highway viability as long as possible, but catastrophic failure could not be avoided. WYDOT remains on site decisively engaged on fixing the road and restoring connectivity to the Teton Valley,\u201d Darin Westby, the department\u2019s director, said in a statement. Department officials said they are reviewing long term solutions and repairs to the highway and Westby urged the public to stay away from the site until it was stabilized.

{"id": "2024_05_31_europe_far-right-european-election-intl", "text": "This is a historic and pivotal year for democracy across the globe. Around\u00a070 countries\u00a0\u2013 from the\u00a0United States\u00a0to\u00a0South Africa, via\u00a0Mexico\u00a0and\u00a0Taiwan\u00a0\u2013 will hold elections in 2024. After India\u2019s huge and ongoing six-week ballot, however, the biggest election in terms of voter numbers takes place this week, when 373 million Europeans can go to the polls and elect 720 members of the next European Parliament. Once the votes have been tallied from across the 27-nation bloc, it is widely expected that the results will show a significant shift to the right, which could have major implications for the political direction of the European Union at a time\u00a0when it is battling\u00a0multiple crises,\u00a0many of them global. From the war in Ukraine to coping with mass migration, the rise of China to the threat of climate change, it\u2019s hard to see how a bloc of\u00a0diverse\u00a0countries could possibly speak with one voice. Of course, differences in opinion among\u00a0the\u00a0member states is nothing new. EU politics has always relied on awkward alliances between countries and political ideologies that represent vastly different electorates. The EU\u2019s political center has undeniably moved to the right over the past two decades,\u00a0however. The European Parliament is the place where this is most visible at an EU level. Most\u00a0of the lawmakers (known as MEPs)\u00a0belong to a political party in their own country.\u00a0Once they enter\u00a0the European Parliament\u00a0in the Belgian capital of Brussels, they sit in loose, multinational political groupings that broadly have similar political interests. These groupings then form even looser coalitions,\u00a0which\u00a0usually results with a majority grouping of centrists from the center-left, center-right and liberals somewhere in the middle. The rightward shift of the political center in this coalition has been gradual. In 1994, the main socialist group S&D had the most MEPs. In 1999,\u00a0it was\u00a0overtaken by the center-right European People\u2019s Party (EPP). The EPP, best explained as conservatives in the mold of former German Chancellor Angela Merkel,\u00a0has\u00a0been the dominant force in\u00a0EU\u00a0politics ever since. While the EPP has been able to lead a mainstream centrist coalition with the left and liberals at a European level, MEPs are still beholden to domestic politics happening back in their own countries. For example, it\u2019s not easy for a conservative to work with a liberal on a pan-EU policy that would share the burden of asylum seekers if voters back home are becoming attracted to loud, anti-immigration populists. The louder the domestic noise \u2013 and the greater the risk of losing their own seat in parliament \u2013 the trickier cross-party politics at a Brussels level becomes. The anticipated influx of\u00a0lawmakers into groups\u00a0to the EPP\u2019s right will\u00a0certainly\u00a0complicate matters. While the\u00a0right-wing\u00a0European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) and\u00a0far-right\u00a0Identity and Democracy (ID)\u00a0groups\u00a0are expected to finish fourth and fifth respectively in terms of seat numbers, their combined tally, which could be upwards of 140,\u00a0according to the Politico Poll of Polls, will be hard for the EPP to ignore.\u00a0The EPP is currently predicted to win 165 seats to 143 for the socialist S&D. ECR and ID are typical of European\u00a0Parliament\u00a0parties in that they are home to a pretty broad group of conservatives. The ECR, for example, was founded by former British Prime Minister David Cameron who campaigned against Brexit. Its current chair is Italian PM Giorgia Meloni, who garnered lots of attention during the 2022 Italian election for her opposition to\u00a0LGBTQ+\u00a0rights,\u00a0promises to curb migration and general anti-globalist rhetoric. However, since\u00a0Meloni\u2019s\u00a0election, she has been seen as considerably more moderate and has supported many key EU initiatives, including support for Ukraine. She has also resisted allowing\u00a0authoritarian\u00a0Hungarian\u00a0leader\u00a0Viktor Orban to join the ECR after he left the EPP. Hungary has been the most pro-Russia EU voice since the start of the war. Whether or not it was deliberate on Meloni\u2019s part, resistance to Orban has made working with her and the ECR more palatable to the Brussels establishment, including EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. ID, too, has sought to moderate its image. It\u00a0recently expelled\u00a0the German far-right AfD party from its ranks after one of its most senior MEPs told an Italian newspaper\u00a0that he didn\u2019t see all members of the SS, the notorious Nazi paramilitary group, automatically as criminals. There is quite a wide range in opinion from the moderate wing of the ERC to the fringes of ID, but political\u00a0currents\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0desire for influence\u00a0can result in some\u00a0odd bedfellows, especially in the opaque and fluid world of European politics. It is unlikely that the EPP would be willing to work directly with ID any time soon, but that doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t be important. History has shown us repeatedly that it\u2019s possible to influence policy from outside the tent. Suppose\u00a0that\u00a0parties associated with ID start putting center-right\u00a0politicians\u00a0under pressure in their own countries. You might find the center adopts their policy ideas \u2013\u00a0as has previously happened in France, the\u00a0United Kingdom\u00a0and Germany. And there are\u00a0more than\u00a0enough hot topics in Europe now for the right to get its teeth stuck into. Migration, climate change, border security, military spending, rule of law \u2013 all of these have been flashpoints in pan-Europe politics for a long time and are not going away any time soon. And it is ultimately the newly-elected Parliament that vets and approves the\u00a0make-up\u00a0of the\u00a0European\u00a0Commission \u2013 the EU\u2019s executive body. It\u2019s worth noting that support for Ukraine is expected to be safe\u00a0for the time being, with the pro-Kremlin\u00a0groups appearing\u00a0very\u00a0isolated. But almost everything else will be handled on a case-by-case basis if the numbers work out that way. And the more MEPs elected that are to the right of the EPP, the more their influence could grow over time. Five years is a long time in politics, and that is how long this Parliament will last. In that time, France will hold an election that Marine Le Pen, who is affiliated with ID, might win\u00a0with her National Rally party. Geert Wilders, also ID, is soon expected to form a government in the Netherlands after emerging as the biggest party in their\u00a0November\u00a0elections. In other words, the domestic politics in member states could shift even further to the right, which naturally changes calculations in Brussels. The European Parliament\u00a0can often seem like\u00a0looks\u00a0like a boring, bureaucratic blob, tediously grinding its way through process. But the EU is an increasingly geopolitical player \u2013 able to impose sanctions on Russian and Chinese political figures, provide funds to Ukraine and use its economic heft as the world\u2019s largest trading bloc in diplomacy. If its political center is indeed shifting to the right, its influence will inevitably have\u00a0meaningful\u00a0and\u00a0perhaps far-reaching\u00a0consequences for people\u00a0living beyond Europe\u2019s\u00a0borders.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/europe/far-right-european-election-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "world"}}

The heat wave, which began on Saturday, has already triggered government weather alerts and follows the country\u2019s hottest spring on record. The national observatory on Monday issued an orange alert for high temperatures \u2013 the second most severe warning \u2013 as sweltering heat engulfed the country\u2019s north. On Sunday, in the coastal province of Shandong, seven national meteorological stations recorded the highest temperature for early June, while temperatures in northern Hebei province and the western region of Xinjiang soared above 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit), according to the National Meteorological Center (NMC). The heat wave is forecast to further expand in scope in the coming days, the NMC said in a statement. Local governments have also issued\u00a0warnings. Beijing on Saturday raised its first yellow alert for high temperatures this summer, warning residents to avoid going outdoors during the hottest parts of the day. The alert came as tens of thousands of high school graduates in the Chinese capital were finishing their national college entrance exam \u2013 a two-day, highly competitive test known as the \u201cgaokao.\u201d A school in Beijing\u2019s Chaoyang district handed out free ice cream to parents waiting outside the gate in the grueling heat, state media reported. Zheng Zhihai, chief forecaster at the National Climate Center, told the state-run Global Times that temperatures in most parts of China were expected to be higher than usual this summer, and the number of high-temperature days would also be greater than usual. Zhong said the high temperatures were linked to El Ni\u00f1o, a natural climate pattern marked by warmer than average ocean temperatures in the equatorial Pacific. China saw its hottest spring on record this year. The national average temperature between March and May reached 12.3 degrees Celsius, the highest since records began in 1961, with 12 national meteorological stations registering temperatures reaching or surpassing records, according to the National Climate Center. Meanwhile, parts of southern China have been grappling with weeks of downpours. In Guangdong province, record\u00a0rainfall unleashed deadly floods in April, with one tribunal of the Pearl River experiencing the earliest arrival of its annual flood season since records began in 1998. China also saw its hottest year on record in 2023, as the world\u2019s biggest polluter confronted a series of relentless heat waves and other extreme weather events driven by the human-caused climate crisis. The average temperature in China last year stood at 10.7 degrees Celsius \u2013 the highest since records began in 1961, according to the National Climate Center, state-run news agency Xinhua reported. It broke the previous record of 10.5 degrees set in 2021. China\u2019s exceptional warmth echoed global trends \u2013 with scientists confirming that 2023 was officially the hottest year on record, the result of the combined effects of\u00a0El Ni\u00f1o\u00a0and climate change.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/china/northern-china-heat-wave-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "world"}}

It was used as a filming location \u2013 doubling for Kashmir \u2013 in \u201cMission: Impossible \u2013 Fallout\u201d for an action sequence at the end of the 2018 film, where the film\u2019s two central characters fall off the cliff. For the premiere of the film, 2,000 people hiked 4 kilometres (2.4 miles) to the cliff to see it projected by lasers at night. Cruise praised the premiere, calling it \u201cthe most impossible screening\u201d of the film. The film was expected to have a positive impact on the area and local tourism, according to the Preikestolen non-profit, who work to preserve the area and keep it safe for visitors.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/europe/norway-cliff-death-preikestolen-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "world"}}

The process of removing the body in order to be transferred to nearby Rhodes for post-mortem and identification has begun, police spokeswoman Konstantia Dimoglidou told CNN via text. The police, fire brigade, coast guard and volunteers have spent days searching land and sea for the doctor, who did not take his phone with him. Police had also investigated reports that he spoke to locals during his walk. On Friday, the search operation was said to be focused on the Pedi area of the island where a woman reported seeing him on Wednesday. The beach near where the body was found is not far from that area. \u201cWe had an incredibly lucky life together,\u201d Mosley\u2019s wife, Dr. Claire Bailey, said in a statement. \u201cWe loved each other very much and were so happy together.\u201d She said her husband \u201cdid an incredible climb, took the wrong route and collapsed where he couldn\u2019t be easily seen by the extensive search team.\u201d The television doctor is known for UK documentary shows such as Channel 4\u2019s \u201cMichael Mosley: Who Made Britain Fat?\u201d and the BBC\u2019s \u201cTrust Me, I\u2019m A Doctor.\u201d Mosley popularized a type of intermittent fasting known as the\u00a05:2 diet, and authored a book on the fast 800 diet, which focuses on time-restricted eating for rapid weight loss. His wife, wrote a recipe book as part of \u201cThe Fast 800\u201d book series. The 67-year-old broadcaster also appeared on British factual entertainment programmes such as BBC\u2019s \u201cThe One Show\u201d and ITV\u2019s \u201cThis Morning,\u201d and is a columnist for British newspaper the Daily Mail. He was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award in 2002 for outstanding non-fiction special (informational) after executive producing the 2001 BBC mini-series \u201cThe Human Face,\u201d which examined the science behind facial beauty, expression, and fame. The father of four deliberately infested himself with parasites to learn more about them for BBC\u2019s 2014 programme \u201cInfested!

{"id": "2024_06_09_middleeast_analysis-gantz-resigns-intl-latam", "text": "Gone from the war cabinet. Gone from the government. Benny Gantz is back where he was at the start of the war Hamas launched on October 7: an ex-defence minister, ex chief of staff \u2013 and Prime Minister Benjamin (Bibi) Netanyahu\u2019s chief political rival. You can\u2019t say he didn\u2019t warn us. On May 18, he announced that if Netanyahu didn\u2019t come up with a coherent plan to bring the hostages home and the governance of a post-war Gaza (among other things), then he\u2019d leave the war cabinet by June 8. In light of Saturday\u2019s rescue of four Israeli hostages, he delayed making good on his threat. By a day. \u201cLeaving the government is a complex and painful decision,\u201d Gantz said in a televised statement on Sunday evening in Israel. \u201cNetanyahu prevents us from moving forward to a real victory [in Gaza]. That is why we are leaving the emergency government today with a heavy heart, but with a whole heart.\u201d So what now? The three most pressing areas of interest where Gantz\u2019s resignation may be felt \u2013 at least for Israelis, the Palestinians in Gaza, and the outside world \u2013 are the Israeli government, the running of the war with Hamas, and Gantz\u2019s own political prospects. Perhaps the most important impact of Gantz\u2019s departure is the one it won\u2019t have: it\u00a0won\u2019t\u00a0cause the government to collapse. \u201cBenny Gantz is in a fix,\u201d former Middle East negotiator Aaron David Miller told CNN on Sunday before Gantz\u2019s resignation. \u201cHe would like to remain in the government, he brings a sort of moderating hand, but he does not have the potential right now to down the government.\u201d That\u2019s because Netanyahu and his coalition partners still have 64 of the Knesset\u2019s 120 seats. So unless US President Joe Biden\u2019s \u2013 sorry, Israel\u2019s \u2013 hostage deal gets done, and Netanyahu\u2019s far-right ministers make good on\u00a0their\u00a0threats to leave the government at what they say they\u2019d see as Israel\u2019s surrender to Hamas, then Netanyahu could safely stay in office till elections are due in October 2026 (opinion polls suggest that if they were held now, Gantz would win). For the Palestinians in Gaza, a Gantz-free government means that at best, things won\u2019t get any worse. The \u201cmoderating\u201d hand of Gantz to which Miller refers seems unlikely to have resulted in Israel going any \u201ceasier\u201d on Hamas, or causing fewer civilian casualties than have occurred. Gantz is no dove. Nor for that matter is the third member of the war cabinet, Defence Minister Yoav Gallant. But both Gantz and Gallant have no qualms about disagreeing publicly with Netanyahu (Gantz once agreed to rotate the prime ministership with Netanyahu, only for the latter to prevent the budget passing so the government would collapse and Gantz wouldn\u2019t get his turn as PM; Gallant was sacked and then unsacked last year, after calling on Netanyahu to pause his contentious judicial overhaul). And so if a hostage deal that were acceptable to them \u2013 but which might cause Netanyahu\u2019s coalition partners to bolt\u00a0instead \u2013 appeared on the table, only for Bibi to block it for personal reasons, they might have been able to\u00a0call him out. With Gantz gone, that\u00a0seems less likely \u2013 as does the\u00a0likelihood of a hostage deal being consummated any time soon.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/09/middleeast/analysis-gantz-resigns-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "world"}}
