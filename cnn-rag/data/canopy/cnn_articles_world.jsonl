Gunmen opened fire at multiple places of worship and a police traffic stop in two cities in the Muslim-majority republic on June 23, killing at least 15 police officers and at least four civilians, including an Orthodox priest, according to authorities. The niqab ban is to take place until \u201cthe identified threats are eliminated and a new theological conclusion is issued,\u201d deputy head of the Mufti of Dagestan Abdulla Salimov said in a video message Wednesday. Assistant to the Mufti of Dagestan Muhammad Muhammadov told the Russian news agency EA Regnum on Wednesday that \u201cthe ban applies in public places where security and personal identification are necessary,\u201d such as streets, public institutions, and other places where there are \u201clarge gatherings of people.\u201d \u201cThe Muftiyat\u2019s recommendation is aimed at preventing potential threats and maintaining public order. The duration of the ban depends on the development of the situation in the region,\u201d he said. The Coordination Center of Muslims of the North Caucasus issued a statement on Wednesday in which it called the wearing of the niqab, burqa and other outer garments that cover the face \u201charmful to Muslims, threatening discord in inter-religious and interethnic relations.\u201d Alexander Bastrykin, the head of the Investigative Committee of Russia, called on lawmakers to \u201curgently\u201d ban the wearing of niqabs in Russia on Saturday. Bastrykin blamed \u201cIslamist terrorists\u201d for the deadly shooting in Dagestan.

{"id": "2024_04_10_style_graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers", "text": "Climbing up abandoned, unfinished floors and tightrope walking across balcony ledges, backpacks clanging with cans of alkyd and acrylic, a collective of Los Angeles graffiti artists have transformed their craft beyond urban aesthetics to champion community issues. Their choice of canvas: Oceanwide Plaza in Downtown LA. Occupying over a full square city block, the plaza was imagined as a vast mixed-use building project, offering city residents over 500 lavish condominiums, a five-star hotel, retail spaces, restaurants and a private 2-acre park. However, construction on the $1 billion project, which began in 2015, was shelved after the Chinese-backed contractor Oceanwide Holdings ran out of funding\u00a0in 2019 \u2014 and it has lain unfinished ever since. The plaza\u2019s status \u2014 and potential \u2014 as an eye-catching venue for their work spread by word of mouth within the graffiti community in recent months. Security at the site was known to be lax, an important detail as accessing the plaza\u2019s towers and other buildings constitutes trespassing. (The Los Angeles City Attorney confirmed to CNN that, as of April 3, criminal charges have been filed against 23 individuals, for violations including trespassing and possession of vandalism tools.) \u201cIt was like a gift from the graffiti gods\u2026 A giant canvas in the middle of downtown,\u201d tagger ENDEM told CNN, speaking on behalf of himself and his graffiti crew, NCT. \u201cWe were like, \u2018Let\u2019s do it right. Let\u2019s do it as if the whole world is going to see this.\u2019\u201d Historically, graffiti has often been used as protest art. While the practice dates back thousands of years, it\u2019s most commonly viewed in a contemporary context (within graffiti\u2019s \u201cmodern\u201d era, which dates back to the 1960s and 70s) as a creative vehicle for challenging societal norms and inequities \u2014 whether on the Berlin Wall in Germany or subway cars in New York City; whether painted by anonymous artists or well-known figures like Keith Haring or Banksy, even if the latter is, technically, anonymous himself. Still, neither ENDEM nor any of the other artists involved realized how famous their work on the Oceanside towers would become. Sharing his artwork on Instagram on January 31, a video from ENDEM quickly racked up tens of thousands of views: Vibrant images of bright block lettering splayed across the building\u2019s exterior paired with footage from the inside \u2014 the artist posing with shots of his spray paint cans, poised above the cityscape. The viral footage, among other visuals shared on social media, quickly opened the floodgates. Hitting Oceanside became a mark of credibility in the graffiti world; by mid-February, the number of tags and other graffiti pieces there were multiplying overnight. \u201cIt was an open house people going in and out. It was beautiful. It was like graffiti paradise,\u201d ENDEM said. \u201cIt felt exactly like the streets, but concentrated.\u201d Transformed in part into an art installation, Oceanwide became an opportunity for the graffiti artists to leave a message to the city below, and a call-out to policy makers who leave buildings to rot. \u201cGraffiti shows you where the city hurts,\u201d Roger Gastman, owner and founder of the LA-based arts organization Beyond the Streets, told CNN. Renowned for its large-scale exhibitions, immersive educational programs, pop-up events and partnerships, Beyond the Streets works to educate and celebrate the diverse dimensions of graffiti as a medium. To him, the mission of graffiti is clear: to challenge, educate, and redefine public perception of the medium. Earl Ofari Hutchinson, president of The Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable, a nonpartisan public policy forum\u00a0for civic participation and education,\u00a0sees the abandoned towers as amplifying the social issues of the community they are situated in, connecting the graffiti-laden structures to the urban blight that surrounds them in LA\u2019s Skid Row. Skid Row is a 50-block sector of downtown LA where between 8,000 and 11,000 unhoused people live in challenging, often squalid conditions. \u201cYou\u2019ve got tens of thousands of people displaced because of over urban development. And as a result of that, they\u2019re on the streets,\u201d Hutchinson told CNN, noting that the homeless population in Los Angeles is continuing to grow. (The Los Angeles Housing Services Authority reports a 9% increase in homelessness in LA county in 2023 and a 10% increase in the city from 2022.) \u201cNow, set right in the middle of that, you have\u2026 a development that will never be completed.\u201d \u201cWhat you have here is a classic urban nightmare brought on by very poor policies \u2014 fiscal, financial, budgetary and political problems (in) a city that has just gone off the rails in terms of over-development and lack of affordability,\u201d Hutchinson added. Still, Hutchinson is no fan of the graffiti either. To him, and many other LA residents who have said they disapprove of the \u201cvandalism,\u201d the plaza is a sore sight for eyes. \u201cThe problem is you\u2019re talking about violating public space and with no permission\u2026 that doesn\u2019t fly with me,\u201d Hutchinson said. \u201cThe fact of the matter is, the public has not given you approval. (And) the general public has to pay for the removal.\u201d Costs currently borne by the taxpayer at the Oceanwide Plaza site include the security details provided by the LAPD as well as the graffiti cleanup Hutchinson highlights. (\u201cThis has strained our deployment,\u201d LAPD Chief Michel Moore said during a February meeting of the Los Angeles City Council. \u201cWe have called in some officers on an overtime basis so that we can provide for these added patrols or station them at that site to deter vandals and others from gaining access.\u201d) Clean teams working in the neighborhoods surrounding Oceanwide remove on average some 2,000 square feet of graffiti per week, with that figure growing in recent months. \u201cPeople forget that people live here. People own businesses here and they don\u2019t want to have to spend the time and money to clean it up,\u201d said Blair Besten, executive director of the Historic Core of Downtown Los Angeles, an organization which works to improve the quality of life in downtown neighborhoods. The Historic Core prioritizes street sweeping, trash collection \u2014 and graffiti removal. \u201cI would hardly call what they\u2019re doing art,\u201d Besten argued of the Oceanwide taggers. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty sloppy and quick. They come in fast and they knock it out and they leave.\u201d But to Gastman, graffiti is a powerful form of expression, and a call-to-action \u2014 particularly for those who emanate from struggles within home life, gang life or societal turmoil. Graffiti culture can offer an unexpected support system for those the city has abandoned, Gastman said. It becomes a platform for them to make their voices heard. \u201cIn graffiti culture, a lot of us know each other. We\u2019re all friends. We have the same mentality \u2014 we\u2019re just trying to get up. We\u2019re just trying to get noticed,\u201d explained ENDEM. In the midst of an addiction that led to his rock bottom, graffiti became his lifeline, he explained. \u201cI was at my lowest of lows, still trying to stay sober, I needed some type of outlet,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cGraffiti is something that you can hold on to. Its bigger than me, its everyone, it\u2019s a community.\u201d In this, ENDEM believes that the beauty of Oceanwide isn\u2019t tangible. Rather, it lies in the birth of a new generation of graffiti writers. \u201cThey can erase the graffiti on buildings, but they can never erase the impact that it has on the city of Los Angeles and the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to it. Yes, it\u2019s vandalism. Yes, it\u2019s art, and it\u2019s everything in between,\u201d Gastman concluded. \u201cThis is a real culture. It\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/10/style/graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_07_04_middleeast_israel-netanyahu-talks-hamas-intl-latam", "text": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has authorized his negotiators to enter into detailed negotiations to try and broker a ceasefire and hostage release deal with Hamas, an Israeli official and a source familiar with the negotiations said. The decision signals that Israel and Hamas are entering a new phase of negotiations that could produce a final deal within a matter of weeks, if successful. Israel and Hamas on Thursday both appeared inclined to underplay the latest developments in written statements, with people involved in the talks expressing cautious optimism. For months, Israel and Hamas have engaged in mediated negotiations focused on trying to reach a framework agreement, intentionally leaving key details \u2014 such as the identity of Palestinian prisoners to be released in exchange for hostages \u2014 \u00a0aside as they worked to hammer out a framework. The breakthrough in the talks came earlier this week after the United States proposed new language for two key clauses (8 and 14) focused on the scope and sequencing of negotiations set to take place during the first phase of the agreement in order to unlock the second phase of the deal. Hamas broadly agreed with the new language, unlocking detailed negotiations following Netanyahu\u2019s approval. Mossad Director David Barnea, who has led Israel\u2019s negotiating team, is set to lead the negotiating delegation for the new round of detailed talks, an Israeli source familiar with the talks said. Talks are expected to be held in Doha, Qatar, starting as early as Friday, according to a senior Biden administration official. The Mossad director is expected to meet with Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani for discussions aiming to bring the parties closer to a deal in Gaza, according to a source with knowledge of the talks. Those negotiations are expected to last two to three weeks, the Israeli source said, to resolve issues such as the identities of Palestinian prisoners to be released, the exact ratio of prisoners to hostages and the technical sequencing of the releases. Basem Naim, a member of Hamas\u2019 political bureau,\u00a0told CNN,\u00a0\u201cthere is nothing official about an effective agreement for ceasefire. The enemy\u2019s media are talking about sending a delegation to Egypt,\u00a0but there is nothing official or any details. Negotiations did not start yet.\u201d \u201cWe are also waiting for a positive response from the Israeli side, which will initiate negotiations into details of the deal,\u201d Naim added. \u201cWe have no information about any delegation visiting Cairo.\u201d Netanyahu spoke Thursday with US President Joe Biden to discuss the progress in the negotiations and the Israeli Cabinet was set to meet Thursday evening. The call focused on the details of the hostage and ceasefire deal, the senior Biden administration official said, adding that there seems to be a \u201cpretty significant opening\u201d for the hostage deal to be agreed upon by all the involved groups. When asked if the administration believes that Netanyahu is playing politics and could try to sabotage the deal, the official said that the deal is structured in a way that \u201cfully protects Israel\u2019s interests.\u201d The official added that Biden will have the opportunity to talk about the deal with other world leaders next week during the NATO summit, which will be held in Washington, DC.

The Recording Industry Association of America \u2013 the trade group on behalf of labels including Sony Music Entertainment, UMG Recordings and Warner Records \u2013 filed two copyright infringement cases against AI companies Suno and Uncharted Labs, the developer behind Udio, for training their AI models with the labels\u2019 unlicensed sound recordings. Udio is the company behind \u201cBBL Drizzy,\u201d the AI-generated song that went viral last month during the Kendrick Lamar and Drake spat. Udio was founded last year by former Google DeepMind researchers to make it \u201ceasy for anyone to create emotionally resonant music in an instant,\u201d according to the company. In April, it raised $10 million in funding. Meanwhile, Suno raised $125 million in funding last month. The platform, which allows users to create songs with only a few prompts, relies on OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT for lyrics and title development. Udio and Suno did not immediately respond to a request for comment. RIAA CEO Mitch Glazier said in a statement that the lawsuits are \u201cnecessary to reinforce the most basic rules of the road for the responsible, ethical, and lawful development of generative AI systems and to bring Suno\u2019s and Udio\u2019s blatant infringement to an end.\u201d He added that the music community is already partnering and collaborating with \u201cresponsible developers to build sustainable AI tools\u201d that put artists and songwriters in charge, but unlicensed services can exploit an artist\u2019s work \u201cwithout consent or pay set back \u2026 .\u201d In April, more than 200 artists, including Billie Eilish, Kacey Musgraves, J Balvin, Ja Rule, Jon Bon Jovi, The Jonas Brothers, Katy Perry, Miranda Lambert and more, signed an open letter\u00a0organized by the non-profit Artist Rights Alliance calling on AI developers, technology companies, platforms and digital music services to \u201ccease the use of artificial intelligence to infringe upon and devalue the rights of human artists.\u201d The lawsuit against Udio states \u201cif developed with the permission and participation of copyright owners, generative AI tools will be able to assist humans in creating and producing new and innovative music.\u201d It added: \u201cBut if developed irresponsibly, without regard for fundamental copyright protections, those same tools threaten enduring and irreparable harm to recording artists, record labels, and the music industry, inevitably reducing the quality of new music available to consumers and diminishing our shared culture.\u201d Meanwhile, the lawsuit against Suno states the company has over 10,000,000 users generating music files using the platform, bringing in about 2,000,000 streams. \u201cThese digital music files have been released to the public\u2014some already finding their way onto the major streaming services\u2014and compete with the copyrighted sound recordings that enabled their creation; yet Suno sought no permission from and gives no credit or compensation to the human artists or other rightsholders whose works fueled their creation.\u201d This story has been updated with additional context and developments.

{"id": "2024_07_05_middleeast_idf-former-spokesman-blames-government-war-intl", "text": "A former spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces has sharply criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s conduct of the war against Hamas, in the latest sign of growing tensions between the military and the government. Lt Col. Peter Lerner said that while speaking with the world\u2019s media on behalf of the military, he came to realize the \u201closs of international trust in Israel and the government\u2019s failure to maintain widespread support for the war against Hamas over time.\u201d\u00a0Lerner served in the IDF for more than 25 years \u2013 most recently as a spokesman during the war, before stepping down last month. Lerner was speaking in an extended interview with the Israeli newspaper Haaretz. \u201cNetanyahu promised a complete victory over Hamas,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in the international arena he and his government led us to defeat.\u201d Lerner told Haaretz that in the early days of the conflict, following Hamas\u2019 attack on Israel on October 7, \u201cThere was a clear understanding that Hamas is an evil and dangerous organization, and that Israel must act against it.\u201d That goodwill quickly eroded, he said, partly because of the inevitable suffering of Palestinian civilians as the IDF began the ground invasion of Gaza. But he also blamed the government, saying \u201cthere is no political strategy for the war, even after nine months in which we are fighting on two fronts.\u201d Lerner said that as he was increasingly asked about the goals of the operation, \u201cI quickly realized that I had no answers to these questions, not because they haven\u2019t been decided yet, but because they simply aren\u2019t going to be decided.\u201d He said he felt like \u201ca soldier who goes to guard without cartridges\u2026 I don\u2019t have the ammunition I need to deal with the interviewers\u2019 questions. I just had to say that I am speaking on behalf of the army, and that these questions are the responsibility of the government. But the government also had no answers, because it was politically inconvenient.\u201d Lerner was also critical of ministers who \u2013 he maintained \u2013 had reduced the legitimacy of Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza. \u201cHamas damaged almost all the power lines that connect Gaza to Israel,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had the opportunity to come and say: Hamas is harming the citizens of Gaza, and we, Israel, will try to fix it, but only if he stops the shooting. Instead, the Minister of Energy at the time, Israel Katz, comes out with populist statements about the fact that he will cut them off from electricity and will not deliver fuel to them either.\u201d Lerner quoted a remark by Netanyahu in 2016 that the test in the field of propaganda is very simple: Were your hands tied when you wanted to defend yourself? He said the Prime Minister had failed that test \u201cmiserably. The US and the UK are cancelling arm s shipments, France forbids us to participate in a large arms exhibition. We delayed for months the entrance to Rafah. This issue requires a state inquiry commission, just like the failures of October 7.\u201d Lerner\u2019s remarks follow multiple accounts of tensions between Netanyahu and Israel\u2019s military leadership. Last week, Netanyahu rejected the idea of starting a ceasefire in Gaza while Hamas remains in power, after the New York Times published an article\u00a0citing six current and former security officials who said a truce would give Israeli troops time to prepare for a potential land war with Hezbollah. The officials, most of whom spoke anonymously to \u201cdiscuss sensitive security matters,\u201d also said a truce would be the most effective way to secure the release of the Israeli hostages. Former Israeli National Security Advisor Eyal Hulata, who according to the Times maintains regular communication with \u201csenior miliary officials,\u201d spoke on the record, saying, \u201cthe military is in full support of a hostage deal and a cease-fire\u2026 they believe that they can always go back and engage Hamas militarily in the future.\u201d In a statement, Netanyahu said, \u201cI do not know who these anonymous sources are, but I am here to make it unequivocally clear: This will not happen. The war will end once Israel achieves all of its objectives, including the destruction of Hamas and the release of all of our hostages.\u201d That report came days after Israel\u2019s\u00a0top military spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, said Hamas could not be destroyed, and that anyone who claimed otherwise was \u201cthrowing sand in the eyes of the public\u201d \u2013 an implicit criticism of Netanyahu, who has repeatedly pledged to eliminate the group.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/middleeast/idf-former-spokesman-blames-government-war-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_style_fumihiko-maki-architect-dies", "text": "Tokyo (AP) \u2014 Japanese architect Fumihiko Maki, who won the prestigious Pritzker Prize for designs praised as smartly and artfully fusing the East with the West, has died. He was 95. Maki, who taught architecture and urban design at Harvard, died June 6, his office, Maki & Associates, said Wednesday. Japanese media reports attributed the cause of death to old age. The office declined to confirm the reports. The National Museum of Modern Art in Kyoto is considered one of his classic designs, with floating forms of glass, metal and concrete. Its gray exterior appears simple at first glance but sets off patterns of reflected light on rough and polished marble. In the U.S., Maki\u2019s projects included the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco and 4 World Trade Center in New York. He also did the Makuhari Messe exhibition hall in Chiba, Japan, and the Hillside Terrace Complex in Tokyo. Maki in the 1980s designed Tokyo\u2019s Spiral building, whose management mourned his death and thanked him for \u201cthe beautiful slopes and the rich space that envisioned an urban park.\u201d In 2013, Maki\u00a0complained about the then planned spaceship-like design\u00a0of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics stadium, slamming it as too expensive and clashing with its surroundings. He said he had the support 100 other people, including architects, in opposing the size of the proposed design by British-Iraqi architect Zaha Hadid. \u201cThe problems I see with the planned stadium all relate to the issue of scale,\u201d he said.That design was eventually ditched for a more modest-looking design by\u00a0Kengo Kuma\u00a0which used pieces of wood for a natural Japanese look. Born in Tokyo in 1928, Maki was educated at the University of Tokyo, the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Michigan and Harvard University Graduate School of Design. Before opening his own design firm in 1965 in Tokyo, he worked in various offices including Skidmore Owings and Merrill, or SOM, based in Chicago, and Sert, Jackson & Associates in Cambridge, as well as the campus planning office of Washington University in St. Louis. A devoted educator, Maki, in addition to teaching at Washington University, Harvard and the University of Tokyo, lectured around the world. His essays were published in a collection called \u201cNurturing Dreams\u201d by MIT Press in 2008. In it, he explored the Japanese sense of space called \u201coku,\u201d which Maki described as \u201cthe core of this high-density space organized into multiple layers like an onion.\u201d Utilizing oku allowed the Japanese to deliver a feeling of depth even in a cramped area, according to this theory. \u201cIn the formation of urban space, certain stable concepts that have been sifted and committed to memory by the collective unconscious of the community work automatically,\u201d Maki wrote. \u201cOku, a spatial concept peculiar to Japan, is a good example, and I believe an understanding of this way of perceiving space is important in formulating ideas of what future cities should be like.\u201d Maki was the second Japanese to win the Pritzker, hailed as the Nobel Prize of architecture, after Kenzo Tange, his mentor. Maki, along with fellow Tange students\u00a0Arata Isozaki\u00a0and\u00a0Kisho Kurokawa, were the pillars of Japanese modernism. The Pritzker, in selecting Maki, praised him as part of a new wave of architects rebuilding postwar Japan. \u201cHe uses light in a masterful way making it as tangible a part of every design as are the walls and roof. In each building, he searches for a way to make transparency, translucency and opacity exist in total harmony. He uses detail to give his structures rhythm and scale,\u201d Bill Lacy, a member of the international panel of jurors that selected Maki, said at the time. Maki was honored with other awards, such as the Wolf Prize from Israel in 1988 and the Arnold Brunner Prize from the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1999. In 2011, the American Institute of Architects honored Maki with its highest accolade, the AIA Gold Medal. Japanese media reports said a memorial service was planned.

There were multiple people in the water.\u201d And they were in trouble. Very serious trouble. Rip current kind of trouble. The scene would send chills of dread down anyone\u2019s spine \u2014 but at least Werneth was prepared. He is an experienced lifeguard instructor and had water rescue equipment with him.  But with at least five people struggling in a vicious Atlantic rip current, how would he possibly save them all?

Whether it\u2019s from these potentially dangerous currents, seemingly placid lakes or swimming pools, the drowning statistics from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are shocking. In the CDC\u2019s most recently updated numbers, more than 4,000 fatal unintentional drownings happen every year in the United States (including boating incidents). That is an average of 11 drowning deaths per day. July tends to be the peak month for deaths. From 2018 to 2021, the states with the most drowning deaths per 100,000 people were the following: 1. Alaska2. Hawaii3. Montana4. Louisiana5. Florida Your odds of drowning are much, much higher than being attacked by a shark or an alligator. World drowning statistics are even more shocking. There are an estimated 236,000 annual drowning deaths worldwide, according to the UN\u2019s World Health Organization. That comes out to an average of 647 people per day. And then there are the even more numerous nonfatal drownings. The CDC says people who survive a drowning incident have a range of outcomes: \u201cFrom no injuries to very serious injuries or permanent disability.\u201d The tragedy is many of these deaths and injuries are preventable, experts say. What can you do to enjoy the water \u2014 be it ocean, river, lake or swimming pool \u2014 safely and not join the ranks of drowning deaths? Turns out, a lot. Who is most at risk? Knowing who is likely to drown is critical. At-risk groups need the most attention. In the United States, those include the following: \u2022 The youngest people: Children 1 to 4 have the highest drowning rates, the CDC says, mostly in swimming pools. \u2022 Males: They account for nearly 80% of fatal drownings in the United States. More risk-taking behaviors and alcohol use are cited as reasons. Across the world, WHO reports males have twice the fatal drowning rate of females. \u2022 People with seizure disorders: People with conditions such as epilepsy are at a higher risk for drowning, and that can happen in a bathtub. Drowning prevention tips The CDC emphasizes the importance of learning basic water safety skills, saying formal lessons can reduce the risk of drowning.  However, \u201cchildren who have had swimming lessons still need close and constant supervision when in or around water,\u201d the agency notes. Don\u2019t get distracted by TV, books or the phone when watching children in the water.  If you\u2019re drinking alcoholic beverages, stay out of the water and don\u2019t go boating. Impaired judgment and slow reactions can lead to tragedy. People in boats and weaker swimmers should wear life jackets, especially in open water. And keep an eye on the weather. Exit if there\u2019s a thunderstorm or heavy rains. Know the water environments Understand the waters you\u2019re about to enter. Different bodies of water carry different types of dangers: OCEAN RIP CURRENTS Rip currents flow away from shore. They often form at breaks in sandbars and close to piers and rock groins.  Look for signs of a rip current before entering, says the United States Lifesaving Association. That can be \u201ca narrow gap of darker, seemingly calmer water between areas of breaking waves and whitewater,\u201d a difference in water color or \u201ca line of foam, seaweed or debris moving seaward.\u201d Here\u2019s what to do you\u2019re caught in one: \u2022 Stay calm. Rip currents don\u2019t pull you underwater but do sweep you farther from shore. \u2022 Don\u2019t swim against the current. Try to escape by \u201cswimming out of the current in a direction following the shoreline,\u201d the USLA says. You may be able to escape by floating or treading water and ride the current out.  \u2022 If you\u2019re in trouble, yell and wave for help. If you\u2019re not trained, don\u2019t try to rescue people yourself. Seek a lifeguard, call 911 or throw a flotation device their way. Direct the person to swim parallel to the shoreline to escape. OTHER OCEAN TIPS The National Weather Service warns swimmers to watch out for \u201cshorebreak\u201d waves. They crash directly onto the sand and can batter and disorient swimmers. \u201cWhen in doubt, don\u2019t go out,\u201d said Wyatt Werneth, who is also the public service spokesperson for the American Lifeguard Association. Swim Guide advises people to swim in the hour before or the hour after low tide or high tide when waters are generally calmer. (But conditions can vary beach to beach). RIVERS Tubing and other activities are popular in rivers. But swift currents and obstacles below the surface or debris can be hazardous.  Werneth said to research the river before you enter. LAKES AND PONDS The placid waters of lakes and ponds can lull waders and swimmers into a false sense of security. Sharp, sudden dropoffs and debris under the water can startle or entangle people, Werneth said, leading to panic and drowning. He said go in with a swim buddy. Dive only in designated areas. The USLA says enter unknown waters feet first to avoid striking your head. Swimmers shouldn\u2019t stray into areas where personal watercraft and boats are speeding by. SWIMMING POOLS The National Drowing Prevention Alliance has this advice for pool owners: \u201cfour-sided fencing with self-closing self-latching gates, door and window alarms, and safety covers can help make sure kids don\u2019t get to the water unsupervised.\u201d And even if your children know how to swim, adults should still maintain a careful watch. Keep flotation devices on hand. BOATING The National Park Service\u2019s \u201cOperation Dry Water\u201d reminds people that all vessels must carry personal flotation devices. National lifeguard shortage Werneth, who is also a spokesman for the American Lifeguard Association, has warned of an ongoing lifeguard shortage in the United States for years now. A June 15, 2024, news release from the ALA called the shortage in Florida \u201cdisturbing.\u201d Werneth said the group\u2019s message has always been \u201cswim in front of a lifeguard.\u201d But he said the reality of the shortage is prompting a new one: \u201cLearn to swim, America.\u201d \u201cWe want people to self-lifeguard. Assign someone in your family to be a water watcher. Have that person learn CPR.\u201d And if someone can\u2019t swim and still wants to wade, \u201cput a life jacket on them. That\u2019s going to make a difference.\u201d Werneth said that if you plan on going to a destination that features water activities, go online first to find out the lifeguard situation and adapt your plans as needed. Some pools, lakes and beaches might not even be open.  Operation Rescue Back in 2017 at that Florida beach, Werneth\u2019s task was daunting. But he had a cool head, decades of experience \u2014 and fortunately, a second experienced helper on hand whom he later learned was from the Air Force. \u201cHe was single-handedly pulling people out before I even got there. \u2026 That Air Force guy was kind of coming back with one. I saw that he had one that was kind of going unconscious, and I immediately jumped in the water, swam out, grabbed the unconscious person and got him out.\u201d Werneth guesses that they were about 50 yards out, and he recalls they ended up pulling five male teens out of the water. They weren\u2019t even in swimming attire, Werneth said, leading him to think it was a spur-of-the-moment decision to enter the ocean. Would the group have died without the rescue, which left him exhausted? \u201cI assure you they all would have. \u2026 These people were going in to help each other, and it caused a chain reaction. Do not go into the water to assist anyone without a flotation device,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was perfect timing that I showed up and happened to be there to help those guys.\u201d All because the family car had broken down. But not everyone can rely on luck. In the end, you need \u201cwater confidence,\u201d gained by experience and respect for the water. \u201cThe fear is what generates the panic which generates the drowning.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/07/03/travel/drowning-water-safety-tips-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_02_style_aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl", "text": "Miami has a new addition to its skyline \u2013 a 66-story residential tower built by Aston Martin, marking the British luxury sports carmaker\u2019s first foray into the residential real estate market. Comprising of 391 units, Aston Martin Residences Miami sits at the mouth of the Miami River on Biscayne Bay, the firm said in a statement Tuesday. Designed in partnership with architect Rodolfo Miani of Bodas Mian Anger and built by G&G Business Developments, the 249-meter- (818-foot-) tall building houses seven penthouses, each with private pools and terraces, as well as apartments ranging in size from one to five bedrooms. The largest unit is the \u201cUnique Triplex Penthouse,\u201d arranged over three floors at the top of the building, which remains on the market for $59 million. The property was officially opened on Tuesday. Timed to coincide with the Formula One Miami Grand Prix, the company said in a statement that it marks \u201cthe latest distinct expression of Aston Martin\u2019s ultra-luxury high performance brand.\u201d Featuring an infinity pool with a pool deck, jacuzzis and cabanas on the 55th floor, the sail-shaped complex has a two-floor fitness center, two movie theaters and a virtual golf simulator. The building has a sky bar and lounge, chef\u2019s kitchen, ballroom and private dining areas, as well as a spa, beauty salon and barber shop. Direct access to the sea via a superyacht marina is also available, plus a private butler service. Germ\u00e1n Coto, chief executive officer of G&G Business Developments, told CNN Tuesday that the firm wanted to work on a project in the \u201ccosmopolitan city\u201d of Miami, and that this piece of land was the perfect choice. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing plot with an excellent view of the river,\u201d said Coto. The structure\u2019s aerodynamic shape helps the building deal with the technical challenges presented by high winds in the area, as well as evoking the sleek shape of an Aston Martin, according to Marek Reichman, executive vice president and chief creative officer of Aston Martin. It also becomes wider from the base to the mid-section before tightening once more towards the top, making it appear to bow out over people on street level, Reichman told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the drama,\u201d he added. Challenges However, the process wasn\u2019t all plain sailing. \u201cIt was difficult to achieve what we wanted because the space and the plot is kind of small,\u201d said Coto, with the building fitting into a 1.25-acre plot of land. Meanwhile, local building regulations imposed strict standards, explained Reichman, taking into account the low-lying land and propensity for flooding. \u201cThey were some of the most amazing challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to withstand the flooding with the windows that are on street level.\u201d There were further obstacles due to the curved shape of the building, which means that units on the east side have an individual architectural structural component. Aston Martin touches Homeowners are able to customize their interior space with the help of the Aston Martin design team, with three style packages \u2013 Timeless, Covert and Indulgent \u2013 drawing on the company\u2019s British heritage, as well as the building\u2019s context. \u201cIt needs to have part of the DNA of an Aston Martin,\u201d Reichman said. \u201cBut we are in Miami, you don\u2019t have a cold November evening where you need to put the log fire on, so you\u2019ve got to be considerate of the environment that you\u2019re in.\u201d Design elements running through the building include doors with bespoke Aston Martin handles, number plinths and kestrel tan leather door tabs. Aston Martin said that 99% of the properties sold before the building was completed. Residences were sold for $1.5 million to $8.5 million, while penthouses ranged from $16 million to $59 million. The Unique Triplex Penthouse, on the market for $59 million, comes with the last remaining Aston Martin Vulcan, an 820 brake horsepower all-carbon fiber supercar, of which only 24 exist, a spokesman for the company said. Meanwhile, buyers of the 47 Signature and Penthouse units were also able to choose between an Aston Martin DBX sports SUV or the company\u2019s DB11 sportscar. Aston Martin isn\u2019t the first luxury carmaker to enter the residential property market. A 63-story building from Bentley will open in 2026 along the coastline of Sunny Isles Beach, Florida. Featuring 216 units, the property will have an elevator designed to take residents up to their doorstep while seated inside their cars.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/02/style/aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_07_04_europe_uk-election-europe-populist-surge-intl", "text": "The United Kingdom\u2019s decision to hand the center-left Labour Party a parliamentary majority comes at the same time Europe is broadly in the grip of what some call a right-wing populist surge. Last month\u2019s\u00a0European elections\u00a0saw a historic number of lawmakers from hard-right and far-right parties elected to the European Parliament. The results caused such chaos that French President Emmanuel Macron called a snap parliamentary election in his own country, the first round of which the far-right National Rally\u00a0won last week. A government composed of far-right figures was formed in the Netherlands this week. Italy is led by the most right-wing leader since the rule of fascist wartime leader Benito Mussolini. These electoral victories and the prospect of populist right-wingers in power is no longer a surprise in European countries. There are many reasons for this rise in populism, often unique to individual countries. But broadly speaking, a number of European countries are suffering from sluggish economies, high immigration and higher energy prices, due in part to the drive for carbon net zero. The European Union is often blamed for national woes by populist politicians and breathes oxygen into an increasingly Euroskeptic national discourse. So why is Britain, the only country where Euroskepticism led to a referendum on EU membership, bucking this trend? Despite the scale of the Labour victory, it is clear from the results that the British right is far from dead. The Conservative Party, despite its undeniably disappointing night,\u00a0has outperformed against\u00a0the\u00a0expectations of a number of opinion polls during the campaign, some of which predicted it would win fewer than 100 seats \u2013 which would have been a truly epic wipeout. Another party that exceeded polling expectations\u00a0is the populist right-wing Reform UK, led by long-term scourge of the Conservatives Nigel Farage, who is perhaps best known these days for his friendship with former US President Donald Trump. Before this, he was credited with making Brexit possible after decades of campaigning against the UK\u2019s membership of the EU. On his eighth attempt, Farage has now been elected as a member of parliament (MP). The Conservatives may have been reduced to only 121 seats and Reform may have only secured four, as of Friday morning, but the overall vote share for these two parties combined is larger than that of Labour \u2013 which has secured more than 400 seats. This will doubtless have a major impact on what happens next to the right of British politics. Ahead of the election, the existence of Reform and pressure from Farage on issues like tax and migration had already forced the Conservatives further to the right. Farage identified that irregular migration, particularly people crossing the English Channel in small boats from France, could become a major factor in an election campaign. His relentless campaigning on the issue forced the Conservatives to introduce the highly controversial Rwanda policy, which would see asylum seekers sent overseas for their claims to be processed. The Conservative Party now needs to find a new leader. The debate over who takes over from Sunak will focus largely on what values the party should embrace. Many Conservatives will believe that by leaning to the right they can steal Farage\u2019s votes. Many will believe that some kind of pact should be done with Farage. Others will want absolutely nothing to do with a man who has spent decades attempting to destroy the Conservative Party. Regardless, it is likely that Farage will play a starring role in the Conservative leadership campaign. Even if he isn\u2019t in the party himself, Farage thrives as an outsider. The majority of his political success to date has all come without him holding a UK parliamentary seat. Now he has not only won a seat himself, but will have a small band of colleagues ready to hurl grenades at Labour leader and new Prime Minister Keir Starmer. That said, it is probably quite a long time before there is any kind of coherently united right. It is possible that Farage\u2019s splitting of the right has actually helped Starmer on his way to such a huge victory. An odd quirk of British politics is that the percentage of votes a party gets doesn\u2019t necessarily translate to seats. Every seat is decided individually, the winner being the candidate with the most votes, which is often less than 50%. And with Reform performing well in many of the seats that Labour won, the hard-right will not only be impossible to ignore in this parliament, but it could easily see its influence grow further. Britain suffers from many of the same problems as other European countries. If Starmer falters as prime minister, there is every chance that the popular right could continue to capture the public\u2019s imagination, as it has elsewhere\u00a0in Europe.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/europe/uk-election-europe-populist-surge-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "world"}}

Muhammed Neamah Naser, a commander in Hezbollah\u2019s Aziz Unit, was \u201celiminated\u201d on Wednesday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said, blaming him for directing terror attacks both before and after Hamas\u2019 October 7 attacks from Gaza The IDF described him as a counterpart of Sami Taleb Abdullah, another Hezbollah commander whose killing last month also triggered a wave of retaliatory strikes. \u201cTogether, they served as two of the most significant\u00a0Hezbollah\u00a0terrorists in southern Lebanon,\u201d the IDF said. In response to the killing, Hezbollah on Thursday said it had launched \u201cmore than 200 missiles of various types\u201d at Israeli targets. The Israeli military said that it intercepted some of those Hezbollah missiles, as well as drones. Some fires broke out as a result of falling shrapnel. In response to those strikes, the IDF said their\u00a0fighter jets have struck Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon\u00a0overnight Wednesday into Thursday. The\u00a0IDF said they struck a\u00a0military structure and three\u00a0\u201cterrorist infrastructure sites.\u201d Hezbollah said Thursday that one of its fighters had been killed. Naser is the latest Hezbollah commander to be killed in hostilities that flared along the Israel-Lebanon border since the October 7 attacks. Israeli fire services said Thursday that they are working on multiple \u201cextensive fires\u201d in the north of the country \u201cas a result of the heavy shelling from\u00a0Lebanon.\u201d More than 10 fires broke out in the area of the Upper Galilee and the Golan Heights, the Israel Fire and Rescue North District said in a statement,\u00a0\u201cwith some of them creating very extensive fires in challenging terrain.\u201d Over 40 firefighting teams and 10 aircraft were working in the region on five major incidents, the statement said. Cross-border fire between Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah has been an almost daily occurrence since the war in Gaza began. But it has been gradually intensifying, raising fears it could escalate into a full-blown conflict. Hezbollah is one of the most powerful paramilitary forces in the Middle East, boasting of tens of thousands of fighters and a vast missile arsenal. The group has said its current round of fighting with Israel is to support Palestinians in Gaza.

{"id": "2024_07_03_europe_france-election-nakamura-opposes-far-right-intl-latam", "text": "France\u2019s most streamed singer Aya Nakamura has joined the chorus of voices calling on the French electorate to vote against the far right in Sunday\u2019s high stakes election. The National Rally party, which is slated to win big in this Sunday\u2019s second round of voting, has drawn criticism and concern from French celebrities of dual nationality, worried about the impact of their immigration policy plans. The party, headed by 28-year-old Jordan Bardella, hopes to restrict dual nationals from accessing certain state jobs. It also wants to strip citizenship rights from those born to foreign parents on French soil. Popstar Nakamura, who immigrated to France from Mali as a child and rose to fame with her smash hit song \u201cDjadja,\u201d made the call in a social media post on Tuesday that zeroed in on her own experiences of racism in France. The 29-year-old  said in her post that she is \u201cwell placed to understand and know the place of racism in our country.\u201d Nakamura said that although she had previously chosen not to weigh in on certain issues, she now understood that her role as a major musical artist requires her to \u201cspeak out\u201d during such an \u201cimportant moment.\u201d She called on her fans to vote against \u201cthe only extreme to be condemned,\u201d in what appeared to be a reference to the far right. In a separate post, Nakamura directly referenced the National Rally party, saying: \u201cF*** the National Rally.\u201d Nakamura later deleted the post, according to reporting from CNN affiliate BFMTV. Nakamura herself is no stranger to threats from the far right, having previously found herself at the center of a controversy earlier this year when speculation mounted that she would perform the classic French song \u201cJe ne regrette rien\u201d at the Olympics opening ceremony. Far-right fringe groups and politicians, including Marion Mar\u00e9chal, a far-right lawmaker and niece of Marine Le Pen, complained that Nakamura does not even \u201csing in French.\u201d This swipe was seemingly a reference to the blend of French and African slang that Nakamura uses in her lyrics. France\u2019s top sports stars have also been using their platforms to urge the public not to vote for the far right. Jules Kounde, a 25-year-old French Beninese national who plays on the French national team, used a press conference during the Euros tournament to share what he called his own \u201cpolitical position.\u201d \u201cI was disappointed to see the direction France is taking, with strong support for a party against our values,\u201d Kounde told journalists after the match between France and Belgium on Monday. \u201cI believe it\u2019s important to block the extreme right, the National Rally, because this party will not lead our country towards more freedom.\u201d Kounde\u2019s remarks echo comments from fellow football star Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, who told journalists earlier during the tournament that he is \u201cagainst extremes.\u201d Mbapp\u00e9, whose family originally came from Algeria and Cameroon, stressed that he didn\u2019t want to \u201crepresent a country\u201d that didn\u2019t embody his \u201cvalues.\u201d The French far right\u2019s strong showing in the first round has prompted concern from several European countries and even top United Nations officials.

{"id": "2024_07_04_asia_modi-putin-russia-india-visit-intl", "text": "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will visit Moscow next week for the first time since Russia invaded Ukraine, a sign of the growing relationship between the two countries even as New Delhi maintains strong ties with the United States. Modi will be in Moscow on July 8 and 9 at the invitation of President Vladimir Putin, India\u2019s Ministry of External Affairs announced, adding they would \u201cexchange views on contemporary regional and global issues of mutual interest.\u201d Modi\u2019s plans for the trip were first reported last month by Russian state media, citing Kremlin officials. India remains heavily reliant on the Kremlin for its military equipment \u2013 a vital link given India\u2019s ongoing tensions at its shared Himalayan border with China \u2013 and has ramped up purchases of discounted Russian crude oil, giving Putin\u2019s nation a major financial lifeline as it faces isolation from the West. Modi\u2019s visit is widely seen as the latest dent in efforts by Western leaders to cast Putin aside. India\u2019s ties with Russia date back decades to the Cold War and have remained strong despite repeated sanctions on Moscow from Western governments. New Delhi has repeatedly abstained from votes condemning Russia at the United Nations Security Council and has avoided public criticism of Moscow\u2019s war in Ukraine. Confirmation of Modi\u2019s visit comes as Russia draws ever closer to China, potentially making New Delhi uncomfortable due to its longstanding Himalayan border dispute with Beijing that has simmered in recent years. On Wednesday, Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Putin hailed their two countries\u2019 deepening alignment at a regional security summit in Kazakhstan, with the Russian leader claiming relations between the two were going through \u201cthe best period in their history\u201d and should be considered a \u201cstabilizing\u201d force for the world. Modi, however, was notably absent from the annual leaders\u2019 meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), a bloc of Eurasian countries spearheaded by China and Russia that is seen as a counterweight to Western institutions led by the US and its allies. Some analysts viewed Modi\u2019s decision to skip the event as a sign the leader of the world\u2019s largest democracy does not view the bloc as an effective channel through which New Delhi can pursue its interests. Modi last met Putin on the sidelines of the 2022 SCO summit, where he told the Russian leader that today\u2019s era is \u201cnot of war.\u201d Yet his upcoming visit to Moscow is being viewed positively by the Kremlin \u2013 which has described Modi\u2019s relationship with Putin as \u201cvery trusting\u201d in nature \u2013 and comes as Russia aims to push back against Western efforts to isolate it on the world stage as punishment for its war in Ukraine. \u201cWe can expect that there will be an exchange of views on all issues that are on the agenda, and there are many of them,\u201d Putin\u2019s spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, according to Russia\u2019s state-run news agency TASS on Tuesday. Last month Putin also met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang, where the two autocrats vowed to strengthen ties and deepen their cooperation in a new partnership that was signed during the visit. Moscow this year has taken up the position as chair of the BRICS economic bloc, which includes Brazil, India, China and South Africa, providing Putin with an opportunity to push back against growing Western isolation and portray himself as a key player on a broad diplomatic stage. But Modi\u2019s visit is set against the backdrop of India\u2019s growing relations with the US, as both countries share concerns over China\u2019s assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific region. Modi met with US President Joe Biden during a state visit to Washington in June last year, in a trip further cementing their defense, trade and technology partnership. The Indian leader also addressed Congress during that trip, an honor typically reserved for close US allies and partners, and attended a lavish state dinner. India is a member of the Quad security grouping with the US, Japan and Australia. Later that year, Putin did not attend the Group of 20 leaders\u2019 summit in New Delhi, during which leaders delivered a consensus statement criticizing his invasion of Ukraine.

{"id": "2024_07_06_americas_argentina-lgbtq-milei-fire-deaths-intl-latam", "text": "It was an attack that sent shockwaves through a country long considered a pioneer in LGBTQ rights. In the early hours of May 6, four lesbian women were set on fire\u00a0in Argentina. Only one of them survived. It happened at a\u00a0boarding house\u00a0in the Barracas neighborhood of Buenos Aires, where Pamela Fabiana Cobas, Mercedes Roxana Figueroa, Andrea Amarante and Sof\u00eda Castro Riglo were sharing a room. Witnesses say a man\u00a0broke in\u00a0and threw an incendiary device that set the women on fire. Pamela died soon after. Her partner Roxana died days later of organ failure. Andrea died on May 12 in a hospital. Andrea\u2019s\u00a0partner Sof\u00eda was the sole survivor. She spent weeks recovering in hospital and is alive today only because Andrea threw herself on top of her to shield her from the flames, Sofia\u2019s attorney Gabriela Conder told CNN. \u201cHer partner saved her,\u201d Conder said. Local LGBTQ rights advocates condemned the attack as a hate crime and lesbicide, saying the women were targeted because of their sexual identity. Police have arrested a 62-year-old man who\u00a0lived in the building but, according to Conder, aren\u2019t currently treating the incident as a hate crime as they say the motive is still unclear. For Argentina\u2019s LGBTQ groups \u2013 many of whom are planning to commemorate the four women with a rally this weekend \u2013 the attack represents an extreme manifestation of what they consider a growing wave of hostility against them. Those they blame most for this rising intolerance are the people in power. Chief among them, they say, is the country\u2019s new far-right leader Javier Milei. \u201cThings changed with the new government of Javier Milei,\u201d said Maria Rachid, head of the Institute Against Discrimination of the Ombudsman\u2019s Office in Buenos Aires, and a board member and founder of the Argentine LGBT Federation (FALGBT). \u201cSince the beginning of the new government, there are national government officials expressing themselves in a discriminatory manner and those hate speeches before our communities from places with so much power, of course, what they do is generate \u2013 actually legitimize \u2013 and endorse these discriminatory positions that are then expressed with violence and discrimination in everyday life,\u201d Rachid said. Milei under fire When Milei ran for president\u00a0in 2023, he and his party\u00a0were accused of making offensive remarks against LGBTQ communities which were deemed hate speech by multiple groups, including Argentina\u2019s National Observatory of LGBTQ Hate Crimes. In a YouTube interview ahead of the November election, Milei insisted that he does\u00a0not oppose same-sex marriage, but in that same interview, he went on to compare homosexuality to having sex with animals. \u201cWhat do I care what your sexual preference is? If you want to be with an elephant, and you have the consent of that elephant, that\u2019s a problem between you and the elephant,\u201d he said, angering LGBTQ communities, who called the comments dehumanizing. In late October, then-congresswoman-elect Diana Mondino, who would later become Milei\u2019s foreign minister, told an interviewer that she supports marriage equality in theory, but at the same time,\u00a0compared it to having lice. \u201cAs a\u00a0liberal, I\u2019m in favor of each person\u2019s life project. It is much broader than marriage equality. Let me exaggerate: If you prefer not to bathe and be full of lice and it is your choice, that\u2019s it. Don\u2019t complain later if there is someone who doesn\u2019t like that you have lice,\u201d she said. After\u00a0taking office in December, Milei took steps that\u00a0critics say weakened protections for LGBTQ groups. He banned\u00a0the use of\u00a0gender-inclusive language\u00a0in government; replaced the\u00a0Ministry of Women, Gender and Diversity\u00a0with a less powerful undersecretariat within the Ministry of Human Capital; and effectively closed the national anti-discrimination agency, saying the Ministry of Justice would\u00a0absorb its functions. Milei\u2019s administration argued that some of those moves were part of his plan to cut public spending in response to the country\u2019s economic hardships. But critics say his actions have normalized a culture of discrimination toward LGBTQ groups, and in the most extreme cases, have led to violent attacks such as the deadly May 6 arson. \u201cWhen hate speech is enabled by those in power, these sectors start to feel legitimized to attack,\u201d Esteban Paul\u00f3n, a former FALGBT president who was elected to Congress last year, told CNN in a phone interview. \u201cAnd obviously, behind the verbal attacks come physical attacks.\u201d \u201c(Attacks) always happened. That\u2019s the reality. But they increased more in this current government due to the hate speeches constantly maintained on television, including hate speeches that our president Javier Milei exerts,\u201d said Jesi Hern\u00e1ndez, a lesbian and communication member of Lesbianxs Autoconvocadxs por la masacre de Barracas (Self-convened Lesbians for the Barracas massacre). \u201cToday it was Pamela, Roxana, Andrea and Sof\u00eda. And tomorrow it can be me.\u201d CNN\u00a0has repeatedly reached out to the presidency for comment on these allegations but has not received a response. Rise in hate crimes In 2023, an annual report by the National Observatory of LGBTQ Hate Crimes recorded\u00a0133 crimes\u00a0in which the victims\u2019 sexual orientation, identity and/or gender expression were used as a pretext for the attacks. Those numbers rose from 2022 and 2021, when 129 and 120 crimes were recorded, respectively. Rachid points out that the observatory\u2019s numbers only represent attacks that have been officially recorded, and that the real figures are likely much higher. Hern\u00e1ndez, meanwhile, notes that daily life for many people has been impacted in ways not shown by statistics alone. Some now fear they could be targeted next. \u201cThe\u00a0truth is that now, sleeping peacefully in your bed is a privilege,\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez said, referencing the May 6 attack, \u201cbecause you don\u2019t know if you have a neighbor who will throw something at you or come in. Sleeping is now a privilege for us.\u201d Despite calls from LGBTQ activists, the arson is currently being investigated as an aggravated homicide rather than a hate crime, according to Conder, Sofia\u2019s attorney. Sofia is set to testify at the end of the month, Conder\u00a0said. CNN has reached out to the criminal court investigating the case but has not received a response. Shortly after the May 6 killings, the presidential spokesperson Manuel Adorni condemned the attack but\u00a0dismissed\u00a0the notion that it was motivated by hatred toward the sexual orientation of the victims. \u201cI don\u2019t like to define it as an attack on a certain group,\u201d Adorni said at a press conference. \u201cThere are many women and men who are suffering violence and these are things that cannot continue to happen.\u201d Progressives condemned his remarks, insisting that the government should regard lesbicide as a hate crime. Adorni responded on social media with a picture of a Spanish dictionary that said\u00a0lesbicide\u00a0is not a registered word. Progress in Argentina Argentina was once a progressive pioneer in\u00a0Latin America. In 2010, it became the first country in the region to\u00a0legalize same-sex marriage. In 2021, it also became the first to allow nonbinary people to mark their gender as \u201cX\u201d on\u00a0national identity documents. LGBTQ activists fear these historic gains are now being undermined \u2013 and potentially threatened \u2013 by the current government.\u00a0But they also take comfort in surveys that suggest anti-LGBTQ views are the minority in Argentina. According to a public opinion survey conducted in May by the University of San Andr\u00e9s, some 72% of respondents said they are in favor of marriage equality, 70% said they support policies that protect transgender people from discrimination, 75% said they do not consider that transsexuality is a disease that should be treated medically, and 79% said that comprehensive sexuality education in schools is a positive thing. The recent attacks have galvanized activists to fight for new policies and actions that would further protect LGBTQ rights. Congressman Paul\u00f3n told CNN that lawmakers are working with rights groups on various laws that would, among other things, punish discriminatory acts, prevent harassment in schools, and ban efforts to try to \u201ccorrect\u201d people\u2019s sexual orientation, identity and gender. He also said that to reduce attacks on LGBTQ communities, their voices and demands should be amplified in more societal sectors. To that end, Hern\u00e1ndez encouraged LGBTQ groups to push back against hate speech, telling those communities: \u201cThey are not insane, they are not sick, they are not people with lice. Quite the opposite. I would tell them that they are a disruptive person, that they are breaking out of the molds of \u2018normality.\u2019 And that they are very brave \u2026 and that they are whatever they want to be, despite all this.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/06/americas/argentina-lgbtq-milei-fire-deaths-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "world"}}

Orban was the first EU leader to visit Moscow since April 2022 and his trip was made even more controversial by the fact that Hungary has just taken over the rotating presidency of the Council of the European Union. Putin and Orban said they discussed ways to end the conflict in Ukraine.  Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Putin said Russia was \u201calways open for discussion\u201d for a political and diplomatic solution to the conflict but stressed that he stands by the terms it has already outlined. Those terms would be unacceptable for Ukraine and its western allies. Ukraine has made it clear that any peace deal must include the return of Ukraine\u2019s pre-2014 territory. Orban\u2019s press secretary Zoltan Kovacs said the prime minister\u2019s visit to Moscow was of \u201cspecial significance,\u201d being the first since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Friday\u2019s meeting marks the 14th\u00a0time the two leaders have met since 2009, he said. Orban has long been Putin\u2019s greatest ally in Europe, a rare outlier among the otherwise united bloc. He has been campaigning for\u00a0a ceasefire as opposed to military support for Ukraine. \u201cThe talks with President Putin at the Kremlin focused on the Ukraine settlement and bilateral relations, emphasizing Hungary\u2019s unique position to communicate with both warring sides,\u201d Kovacs said in a post on X following the meeting on Friday. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen criticized Orban\u2019s decision to visit Moscow, saying \u201cappeasement will not stop\u201d Putin. \u201cOnly unity and determination will pave the path to a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in Ukraine,\u201d she added. Kyiv was also quick to criticize Orban\u2019s trip. \u201cThe decision to make this trip was made by the Hungarian side without approval or coordination with Ukraine,\u201d Ukraine\u2019s foreign ministry said Friday. \u201cWe remind that the principle of \u2018no agreements on Ukraine without Ukraine\u2019 remains inviolable for our country and call on all states to strictly adhere to it.\u201d The ministry said Ukraine\u2019s peace formula \u2013 the plan outlined by President Volodymyr Zelensky \u2013 \u201cremains the only realistic way to restore a just peace.\u201d Orban\u2019s trip to Moscow came just days after his trip to Kyiv on Tuesday, his first visit to Kyiv\u00a0since Russia\u2019s full-scale war began.

The snap vote, called by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, is being held months earlier than necessary and caught much of his party by surprise. The opposition Labour party suffered its worst defeat since 1935 in the last general election, but has since rebuilt itself under the leadership of Keir Starmer. Thursday\u2019s vote follows a six-week campaign in which all major parties have scoured the country in search of votes. Much of the debate has revolved around the economy, the cost of living, the state of Britain\u2019s public services, and tax and immigration. Largely absent from the debate, however, has been Britain\u2019s relationship with the European Union, which it left in 2020 after a referendum four years earlier. Britain has had three Conservative prime ministers since the last general election in 2019, which Boris Johnson won by a landslide. But after much of the country and his party soured on Johnson, Conservative party members voted in 2022 to replace him with Liz Truss, who became the shortest-serving prime minister in British history. Conservative Members of Parliament (MPs) then voted to replace her with Sunak. During the campaign, Nigel Farage \u2013 one of the most prominent champions of Brexit \u2013 announced his return to frontline politics to lead the nascent hard-right Reform UK party. Sunak, Starmer, Farage and the heads of all other major parties are expected to make appearances at their own local polling stations throughout the day. Around 46.5 million Brits are eligible to vote in the election. They are casting their ballots in 650 separate constituencies across the nations of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, with 326 seats required for a party to form a majority government. News outlets are barred from reporting anything that could influence voters while polls are opened. An exit poll from British broadcasters will project the seat totals are soon as polls shut at 10 p.m. local time (5 p.m. ET), and counting will take place throughout the night and into Friday morning.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/uk-general-election-polls-open-sunak-starmer-gbr-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_05_travel_van-life-travel-cec-wellness", "text": "Home is where you are. Home is where you make it. Home on the range. Home is \u2026 in a camper van? Absolutely! When I tried camper van life for the first time, I went all in. For three weeks, my husband and I drove a kitted-out, circa 2012 Ford Econoline van across North America, traveling from northern New Jersey to Los Angeles as we wound our way along the length of Route 66 in November 2019. It was a bold move, but I knew it was the most cost-efficient and efficient-efficient way to see as much of \u201cthe Mother Road\u201d as we could. My hope was that by renting a camper van, we\u2019d save money on purchased meals and hotel rooms and also feel more immersed in the journey and deeply connected to each town we visited. Our first night in the Bloomington, Illinois, Walmart parking lot was a little nerve-racking. I lay in my sleeping bag, listening to the activity beyond the van and wondering if we could handle this adventure. But after the first successful sleepover, we quickly settled into a routine. We\u2019d wake up each morning for a quick bathroom run and even shower at some of the surprisingly luxurious recreational vehicle parks we patronized. Then we\u2019d cook breakfast on our camp stove at the rear of the van and hit the road by 8:30 or 9 a.m. After a day covering roughly 130 miles and experiencing the historic sites, local museums, former filling stations and proudly kitschy roadside attractions along Route 66, we\u2019d make sure to arrive at our nightly destination by 4:30 p.m. \u2014 sundown in November comes early. By the time we dropped off the van near Los Angeles International Airport in late November, I felt like I was saying goodbye to a new but dear friend on the last day of summer camp. We\u2019d unwind, explore the sights of the town, treat ourselves to dinner away from the van, then bunk down in our sleeping bags and do it all again the next day. (We spent two-thirds of the trip sleeping in the van and the other third in historic lodgings along the route, such as Boots Court in Carthage, Missouri, and the El Rancho in Gallup, New Mexico.) The benefits of camper van travel Now, I\u2019m not saying you must spend weeks on an epic road trip to fully experience the joy of a camper van. And I\u2019m certainly not saying you need to sell all your possessions and become a full-time van lifer \u2014 I\u2019m grateful to return to my house and my cats after every trip. But even a few days of traveling and living in a camper van can give you a whole new perspective on yourself and the world around you. When you\u2019re in a camper van, everything you need is within reach \u2014 to an extent. I loved the challenge of condensing our lives into approximately 75 square feet and finding creative ways to live comfortably but efficiently. The morning coffee? It\u2019s right there. Your outfit for the day? Just reach behind you. If you need to change your shoes into hiking boots, grab a raincoat for an unexpected downpour, refuel with a quick snack or recharge with a 20-minute power nap, you don\u2019t need to go far. And you don\u2019t have to repack your bags to leave a hotel every morning. After the first night, I embraced the security and sanctuary of the van, knowing that whatever we had was around us. If we couldn\u2019t find it right away, it wasn\u2019t lost. We had exactly everything we needed \u2014 everything except, well, a bathroom, which brings me to the next life-changing aspect of a camper van. Camper van life makes you brave and gets you out there, interacting with others and connecting with the world. You\u2019re always in the environment, not separated by hotel corridors and lobbies. You\u2019re discovering creative places to stay for the night, looking forward to chatting with bartenders during the nightly dinner at a local restaurant or just fielding questions from strangers about the van and your trip. During our Route 66 adventure, our van prompted exchanges and allowed us to have moments we would likely have missed in a rental car. In Arcadia, Oklahoma, we stopped by Pops 66 Soda Ranch and struck up a conversation with a woman admiring our brightly painted camper van. She told us about one of the chairs at the nearby Oklahoma City National Memorial representing a boy named Zackary who loved collecting pennies. The next morning, we found Zackary\u2019s chair and placed a penny on it for him. Because the van functioned as a full campsite rig, we didn\u2019t have to figure out the logistics of bringing or renting equipment to camp in Joshua Tree National Park in California. We spent two nights in wonder among the granite boulders, with Cassiopeia shining brightly above, and two mornings waking up with the sun and the scent of high desert air. Tips for trying the van life Ready to try camper van travel? Companies rent vans that come fully equipped with mini kitchens and bedding, so it\u2019s almost as easy as booking an Airbnb. Some even come with toilets and showers, so that doesn\u2019t have to be a deal-breaker. Rent one for a quick round-trip weekend visit or explore further by taking a one-way jaunt to another rental hub and then flying home. If you\u2019re itching to have a new type of travel experience, you\u2019ll find it behind the rolling door of a camper van. As another well-loved saying goes, \u201cIt\u2019s not the destination, it\u2019s the journey\u201d \u2014 but with a camper van, you\u2019ll get to appreciate both at once.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/travel/van-life-travel-cec-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_style_paris-2024-olympic-village", "text": "When Paris last hosted the Summer Olympics 100 years ago, organizers were so keen to bring athletes under the same roof that they built the first-ever Olympic Village. It was spartan, made up of furnished wood huts, and it was razed shortly after. The competition is back in the City of Lights a century later, but French officials are doing something completely different this time around. As part of their effort to make Paris 2024 the \u201cmost responsible and sustainable games in history,\u201d they\u2019re building something that\u2019s meant to last. \u201cThis village was thought up as a neighborhood, a neighborhood that is going to have a life afterwards,\u201d said Georgina Grenon, the Paris 2024 director of sustainability. \u201cParis 2024 is renting it for a few months.\u201d Instead of rooming in apartments tailor-made for them, athletes in the Olympic Village this summer will be living in what will become someone else\u2019s home or workplace. Once the Paralympics have finished on September 8, the village \u2014 which contains 82 buildings \u2014 will be converted into office space for 6,000 workers and apartments to house another 6,000 people. The hope is that the project will provide a model to alleviate a housing crisis in the French capital, where rising interest rates, surging prices and a supply crunch have made it harder than ever to buy or rent a home. Demand for affordable housing is so intense that when a small 10 square meter (108 square feet) apartment in Paris\u2019 up-and-coming 10th arrondissement hit the rental market last year at a price of 610 euros ($614) per month, it attracted a staggering 765 applicants in less than a week. The site for the Olympic Village was chosen in the hopes it would revitalize some of the city\u2019s historically impoverished northern suburbs. The village lies at the juncture of three suburbs: Saint-Denis, a diverse, working-class neighborhood long associated with crime and insecurity; the rapidly gentrifying Saint-Ouen; and Ile-Saint-Denis, an island on the Seine River. Organizers say post-Olympics, 32% of the new homes in Saint-Denis and Saint-Ouen, and 48% of those in Ile-Saint-Denis built for the Games will be set aside for public housing. There\u2019s a risk, however, that current residents could be priced out. Similar pledges to build affordable housing in east London were made in advance of the 2012 Olympics, but those promises ended up largely falling flat. A BBC report in 2022 found that of the 9,000 homes built within the Olympic Park, less than 200 were offered at the cheapest levels of rent. \u2018It\u2019s a huge test lab\u2019 Like the Olympics themselves \u2014 which organizers say will run 100% on renewable energy \u2014 everything built for the village was done with sustainability in mind. To minimize the amount of construction, organizers temporarily or permanently retrofitted several existing structures on the site, including an old electric factory that\u2019s been turned into a \u201cresident center.\u201d They also rented existing movie studios in the area to be used as training facilities for athletes instead of building new training facilities which has been done at some other Games. The buildings that were erected were built with wood and recycled materials, employing processes that, according to Grenon, reduced the project\u2019s carbon footprint by 30% per square meter \u2014 more than French ecological regulations require. A third of all the rooftops are equipped with solar panels, while another third have gardens meant to bring down the temperature inside, Grenon said. And long, straight openings leading to the Seine were left in between the buildings to form wind tunnels carrying the fresh air near the river as far inland as possible. Temperatures this summer are expected to be warmer than normal, according to France\u2019s national weather service, and there is widespread concern heat could jeopardize athlete safety. But the structures themselves aren\u2019t the only thing that will be recycled. The village will house about 3,000 apartments containing a total of 14,250 beds made with recyclable materials similar to the ones used in Tokyo. The mattresses were manufactured with reused materials and their firmness can be adjusted by flipping them over. Stools were made with cardboard meaning they can be easily recycled after the Olympics. Across the village, organizers are running a handful of experiments to see if new green technologies and construction methods are viable in the real world. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge test lab,\u201d Grenon said. One sidewalk has been made with seashells. In theory, those shells are supposed to absorb rain. On hot days, the stored water should evaporate and help cool passers-by. The village\u2019s main drag features five experimental outdoor air filters. These giant, UFO-like towers are designed like vacuums to suck in the polluted air and filter out dangerous particles. The device can clean \u201c95% of the air of the particulate matter \u2014 all sizes,\u201d its creator, Jerome Giacomoni, told CNN. The five devices can clean the equivalent of the volume of 40 Olympic-sized swimming pools an hour with very little electricity consumption, Giacomoni said. Keeping cool The most scrutinized innovation will likely be the geothermal cooling system, as athletes in Paris could face the same level of sweltering heat and humidity that broiled Tokyo during the Summer Olympics there three years ago. \u201cClimate change should increasingly be viewed as an existential threat to sport,\u201d Sebastian Coe, the president of World Athletics, said in a report published last week (June 18) examining the heat risks associated with this summer\u2019s games. While the ground floor of some buildings in the Olympic Village are equipped with traditional air conditioning because they will be converted into shops after the Olympics, the athlete apartments will use geothermal cooling instead of air conditioning. This system takes water cooled to 4 degrees Celsius (39 degrees Fahrenheit) from wells as deep as 70 meters (230 feet) underground at a nearby geothermal plant and transports them to pipes under the floors of each apartment. That cold water should be able to cool the building by 6 to 10 degrees Celsius compared to the temperature outside, according to Laurent Michaud, the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Village director. While the system will be controlled at the building level, each apartment has a thermostat that allows them to lower or raise the temperature by 2 degrees Celsius in each unit. The system will also heat apartments in the winter. The human-caused climate crisis has made heat waves more frequent and intense, and they are starting earlier in the year in many parts of the world. Paris is particularly vulnerable \u2014 people in the French capital are more likely to die from extreme heat than any other city in Europe, a study that looked at more than 850 cities showed. As of 2022, just 19% of all households in Europe were equipped with air conditioning, according to the most recent figures from the International Energy Agency. But extreme heat across the world has driven up global demand for AC units, creating a climate Catch-22, as air conditioning systems use large amounts of energy, much of which still comes from fossil fuels that emit carbon dioxide and heats the planet. For delegations concerned about the system\u2019s efficacy during a heat wave, the village will offer them the option to rent individual air conditioning units. Asked about the lack of air conditioning in the Village by news agency Reuters in March, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo said the village was \u201cdesigned to avoid the need for air conditioning, even in very, very high temperatures.\u201d \u201cWe are on the brink of a precipice.

The court sentenced Finnegan Lee Elder to 15 years and two months in prison and Gabriel Natale-Hjorth to 11 years and four months in prison \u2013 further reductions from the original life sentences both men were handed in 2021, after a jury convicted them of murder, according to Craig Peters, the US lawyer representing the Elder family. Elder and Natale-Hjorth were arrested in 2019 while on vacation in Rome for the murder of the Italian police officer Mario Cerciello Rega, who was stabbed 11 times with a knife in a botched drug deal, police said at the time. In 2022, Reuters reported that the appeals court had lowered Elder\u2019s sentence to 24 years, and Natale-Hjorth\u2019s sentence to 22 years. \u201cElder admitted killing Rega, but both he and Natale-Hjorth said they had acted in self-defense because they thought (Rega and another police officer) who were not in uniform were thugs out to get them after a botched attempt to buy drugs,\u201d the news agency reported at the time. Italy\u2019s highest Cassation Court ordered a new trial in 2023. \u201cThe decision rendered today has highlighted a legal qualification of the conduct on that tragic night that is certainly more in line with Finnegan\u2019s actual responsibilities,\u201d Renato Borzone and Roberto Capra, the Italian lawyers for the Americans, said in their statement. They added that the court had not yet given its reasoning for the verdict. However, they added that the court\u2019s recognition that, at the time of the incident, Elder could not have known Rega was a police officer, allows the case \u201cto be viewed quite differently.\u201d \u201cIt is regrettable that we have had to wait through five levels of jurisdiction to see recognized what the young American man has stated since his first interrogation,\u201d the joint statement said. Elder\u2019s father Ethan said in the statement that \u201cit should not be forgotten that this trial is connected to the tragedy of a person\u2019s death\u201d but he \u201cfelt it was right\u201d to bring out the \u201ctruth of the facts\u201d to help his son. \u201cFrom the very first moment, (Elder) stated that he did not understand that they were (policemen) and that he had reacted to a blocking attempt,\u201d Ethan said in the statement. \u201cBut he could not rest because no one believed him.\u201d \u201cI hope that while he will pay for his mistake, it will also open up hope for him in the future,\u201d the statement ends.

{"id": "2024_07_05_weather_west-coast-california-oregon-heat-wave", "text": "An extremely dangerous, unusually long heat wave is intensifying and spreading up the West Coast \u2013 and there will be no relief for days. California, Oregon, Washington, Nevada and Arizona are bracing for potential wildfires, opening cooling centers and warning residents to stay indoors and keep hydrated as the unrelenting heat wave delivers sweltering temperatures well into the 100s and 110s \u2013 with highs in the 120s possible in the Desert Southwest. And it\u2019s only getting hotter. Death Valley, California, could top 125 degrees by Sunday or Monday, setting a new daily record for those dates. Las Vegas, Nevada, could also exceed its all-time high temperature of 117 degrees Sunday or Monday. \u201cConfidence is increasing that this potentially historic heatwave will last several days,\u201d the National Weather Service in Portland warned, adding the risk of heat-related illness will increase significantly. Extreme heat\u00a0is one of the leading weather-related killers in the United States, leaving hundreds of people dead each year, according to the\u00a0National Weather Service. In\u00a0San\u00a0Jose, California, a homeless man\u00a0died Tuesday due to the extreme heat, Mayor Matt Mahan said.\u00a0The man was 69, according to the mayor\u2019s spokesperson, Tasha Dean, citing information from the\u00a0Santa Clara Medical Examiner\u2019s Office. The same day, a 10-year-old died in Arizona after experiencing a heat-related emergency while hiking with family in South Mountain Park and Preserve, the Phoenix Police Department said. \u201cThis is a DANGEROUS situation, especially for sensitive populations,\u201d the National Weather Service in Los Angeles said, reminding residents to drink plenty of water, stay in the shade, wear light, loose fitting clothes and never leave anyone in a car. Saturday will likely be the hottest day in this prolonged heat wave. High temperatures in the 110s are becoming common across California, outside coastal areas and higher elevations, the National Weather Service said. \u201cThis level of heat throughout parts of the Mojave Desert and Sacramento/San Joaquin valleys of California could pose a risk to anyone if proper heat safety is not followed,\u201d the weather service said. Nationwide, nearly 140 million people remain under heat alerts \u2013 mostly in Western states, where the heat wave is expected to last through the middle of next week. More than 70 million people will be under heat alerts in parts of 10 western states on Saturday. Parts of Oregon will experience triple digits Friday, and the heat could last up to five days with poor overnight relief, the National Weather Service in Portland said. A state of emergency was declared in Multnomah County, Oregon\u2019s most populous county, for this weekend\u00a0as temperatures were expected to climb. \u201cI\u2019m particularly worried about the thousands of people heading to music festivals and sporting events this weekend,\u201d Multnomah County Health Officer Dr. Richard Bruno said in a news release. \u201cThey\u2019ll be spending a long time outside, may have little access to shade and water and may not recognize the risk.\u201d Bruno said the area has had few hot days so far this year, and residents\u2019 bodies have not yet acclimated to the heat. A previous heat wave that scorched Oregon in 2021 left dozens of people dead. Power equipment buckled in the heat, triggering rolling blackouts for tens of thousands as temperatures soared above 100 degrees Fahrenheit. While this heat wave isn\u2019t expected to be as intense as the 2021 scorcher,\u00a0forecasters are concerned about its long duration, said Meteorologist Noah Alviz of the National Weather Service in Portland.\u00a0\u201cGetting into the upper 90s or even triple digits of 100 to 105 for four to five days \u2013 that is very unusual for this location,\u201d Alviz told CNN. \u201cThe triple-digit heat will expand northward into the Pacific Northwest and parts of the central Great Basin, with widespread highs rising into the 90s and low 100s,\u201d the National Weather Service said. \u201cThe duration of this heat is also concerning as scorching above average temperatures are forecast to linger into next week.\u201d Intense heat is expected to persist for much of the West Coast into the weekend. Major to extreme heat risk, the highest two levels, are expected for much of California and the Southwest on Saturday and Sunday, meaning health effects of heat become more likely in anyone without adequate hydration or cooling. Over a dozen high-temperature records were either broken or tied on Thursday, including multiple California cities. Palmdale reached 110 degrees, and Madera hit 109 degrees. The extremely dangerous and potentially deadly heat baking parts of the US also set a few all-time record high temperatures in some locations Friday. Palm Springs, California, reached 124 degrees Friday afternoon, exceeding the previous all-time record high for the date of 123 degrees set in 2021. An all-time record high of 105 set in 2012 was also broken in Raleigh, North Carolina, where temperatures of 106 degrees were recorded Friday. Additional daily record highs set on Friday included: \u2022 114 degrees: San Jacinto, California\u2022 109 degrees:\u00a0Medford, Oregon\u2022 109 degrees: Campo, California Dozens of additional temperature records are expected to be tied or broken each of the next few days. The dangerous heat will expand into the Intermountain West and northern High Plains by next week. The stage is set for wildfire spread The extreme heat \u2013 combined with gusty winds and low humidity \u2013 means any wildfires that start will spread quickly through already parched vegetation. Red flag warnings are in effect across the West, including in the area of the Thompson Fire, which has consumed more than 3,700 acres in California\u2019s Butte County since it was reported Tuesday. The blaze, which was 55% contained by Friday afternoon local time, has forced thousands of people to evacuate and prompted more than 2,000 firefighters to battle the flames under the extreme heat in the Oroville area. The wildfire has injured 11 firefighters, including eight who were affected by heat-related illnesses, according to Chris Peterson, a spokesperson for the\u00a0California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection \u2013 also known as Cal Fire. Twenty-six structures have been destroyed by the blaze and more than 4,000 are under threat. The state\u2019s been seeing an active fire season, with more than 145,000 acres burned so far in 2024 compared to 7,812 acres burned by this time last year, according to\u00a0Cal Fire. There are now nearly two dozen active wildfires of varying sizes burning across California, and the Thompson Fire is among the largest, according to\u00a0Cal Fire. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing fires on the coast in San Diego, to the foothills in Butte,\u201d Cal Fire Deputy Director Nick Schuler told CNN Wednesday. \u201cOur\u00a0firefighters are battling fires across California and often times on the line for more than 24 hours. It\u2019s difficult conditions that they face.\u201d A wildfire in California\u2019s Mariposa County, the French Fire, injured three firefighters and destroyed four structures, according to Cal Fire. It also triggered evacuation orders Thursday night. The fire has burned more than 900 acres just northwest of the small community of Mariposa, outside Yosemite National Park, and is 20% contained as of Friday evening. More than 800 structures are under threat. \u201cFirefighters continue to gain containment and cool hot spots throughout the fire,\u201d CAL Fire said in an update on its incident page Friday. \u201cUtility crews are working diligently to repair and replace damaged infrastructure.\u201d California Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a\u00a0state of emergency\u00a0for the area of the Thompson Fire on Wednesday. The declaration cleared the path for additional resources, including the possibility of mobilizing the California National Guard to assist. And in central Washington state, fireworks sparked an active wildfire called the Balsam Root Fire early Friday morning, according to Wenatchee Valley Fire Department Chief Brian Brett. The fire is burning in Wenatchee, about 150 miles east of Seattle. The fire is currently around 250 acres and is 30% contained, Brett told CNN. A Level 3 Evacuation Alert is in effect for approximately 150 homes. Residents under this advisory are being told to leave immediately. The department had previously reminded residents \u201cprivate fireworks are banned in most of Chelan and Douglas Counties.\u201d Fireworks started an estimated 31,302 fires in 2022, according to the National Fire Protection Association. Southeast to see sizzling temperatures, too As the West swelters, oppressive heat and humidity will begin to shift eastward to the mid-Atlantic and Southeast for the end of the week. \u201cWarm overnight conditions in the upper 70s and low 80s will offer little relief, leading to a dangerous situation for those without access to adequate cooling,\u201d the National Weather Service said. New heat alerts are now posted in southeast Texas, extreme southern Florida and parts of the Southeast northward to the mid-Atlantic, where high temperatures will range between 95-105 degrees. Cities including Houston, Miami, Atlanta, Raleigh and Washington, DC, will be feeling the heat. The heat index values \u2013 how air feels to the human body \u2013 will range between 100 and 115 degrees in those areas. \u201cA cold front entering the southern Plains is anticipated to offer cooler and below average temperatures to Oklahoma, much of northern/western Texas, and the Mid-South by Friday,\u201d the weather service said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/weather/west-coast-california-oregon-heat-wave/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_07_03_tech_elevenlabs-ai-celebrity-voices", "text": "Actress Judy Garland never recorded her voice to read an audiobook of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, but you\u2019ll soon be able to hear her rendition of the children\u2019s novel that inspired the movie nonetheless. Earlier this week, AI company ElevenLabs said it is bringing digitally produced celebrity voice-overs of deceased actors, including Garland, James Dean and Burt Reynolds, to its newly launched Reader app. The company said the app takes articles, PDF, ePub, newsletters, e-books or any other text on your phone and turns it into voice-overs.  \u201cWe deeply respect their legacy and are honored to have their voices as part of our platform,\u201d said Dustin Blank, head of partnerships at ElevenLabs. \u201cAdding them to our growing list of narrators marks a major step forward in our mission of making content accessible in any language and voice.\u201d The company said it made deals with the estates of the actors whose voices are being used, but did not share details about compensation. The effort shows the potential of artificial intelligence for Hollywood but also sets a precedent for licensing and working with estates. It also comes at a time when the technology has grown by leaps and bounds, particularly in its ability to create images, text and sound, making it easy for anyone to create a version of someone\u2019s voice saying something they never did. That, in turn, has raised questions in creative industries such as journalism and film about how artificial intelligence can \u2014 or even should \u2014 be used. ElevenLabs previously made headlines earlier this year when its tool was reportedly used to create a fake robocall from President Joe Biden urging people not to vote in New Hampshire\u2019s presidential primary. Copyright questions and authenticity The partnership with the stars\u2019 estates comes two months after ChatGPT-maker OpenAI came under fire after introducing a synthetic voice that was eerily similar to Scarlett Johansson\u2019s character in the film \u201cHer.\u201d Johansson said in a statement shared with CNN that she was \u201cshocked, angered and in disbelief\u201d that the company would use her likeliness likeness after she turned down a partnership opportunity with OpenAI. Although a person can\u2019t copyright their own voice, it\u2019s possible to copyright a recording, according to David Gunkel, a professor at the department of communications at Northern Illinois University who tracks AI in media and entertainment. The AI is trained on old recordings and those recordings are under copyright. \u201cElevenLabs\u2019 new partnerships are all well within the realm of what the law allows,\u201d he said. \u201cAn estate will get a considerable amount of money from licensing and agreements. It\u2019s not unlike a company negotiating a copyright deal to use a popular song by Queen in an ad. The record company also could in theory say no, no matter how much money they\u2019re offered.\u201d Bern Elliot, a vice president and analyst at market research firm Gartner, said AI models can now be trained on fewer audio recordings; very little is needed to capture tone, speech patterns and other elements, whether it\u2019s for a celebrity or an everyday person. \u201cThe bigger concern is determining what the owner of those recordings can or can\u2019t do to monetize the voice,\u201d he said. Media companies are also ramping up their use of AI for voiceovers. Last week, NBC announced it is bringing an AI-version version of famed sportscaster Al Michaels back to the Olympics this summer, in daily recaps on its Peacock streaming platform. An NBC spokesperson told CNN that Michaels is being compensated for his involvement. It\u2019s unclear, however, how AI versions of well-known voices will be received by mass audiences and if it will raise concerns around authenticity. \u201cWe don\u2019t know yet the supposed market for these types of things but you can already see with audiobooks that ones read by recognizable voices and celebrities are a hot commodity,\u201d Gunkel said. \u201cIf there\u2019s a way to have a celebrity do all kinds of content and not voice it themselves, that could open up the market even wider.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/tech/elevenlabs-ai-celebrity-voices/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "world"}}

The Fever star reached the historic stat line with just over seven minutes left in the fourth quarter, as the 22-year-old came down with a defensive rebound on a Kayla Thornton miss. Clark finished with 19 points, 13 assists and 12 rebounds, for the first triple-double in Fever history. \u201cObviously, it\u2019s really cool. I mean my teammates have been finishing the ball really, really at a high rate, my assists numbers is because of them,\u201d Clark said after the game. \u201cHonestly, I\u2019m just happy we won.

Turkey defender Samet Akaydin had given his side the lead 10 minutes before halftime with a powerful header from a sumptuous Arda G\u00fcler cross. After consistent pressure on the Turkey goal, the Netherlands eventually equalized through a thumping header from defender Stefan de Vrij. The Netherlands then took the lead six minutes later when Mert M\u00fcld\u00fcr touched the ball into his own net under pressure from Cody Gakpo to score an unfortunate own goal. The Netherlands will play England in the semifinals on Wednesday, July 10 in Dortmund. Turkey was playing without its match-winner in the round of 16, Merih Demiral, after he was suspended for two games following a controversial hand gesture made by the defender in the previous round. Demiral scored twice in Turkey\u2019s 2-1 win against Austria and celebrated by making a gesture known as the \u201cwolf salute,\u201d which is associated with the Turkish right-wing extremist group \u201cGrey Wolves.\u201d \u201cDoes anyone say that the Germans have an eagle on their jerseys? Does anyone say that the French have a rooster on their jerseys?\u201d Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, who was at the game in Berlin, told Turkish broadcaster TRT on Friday. The atmosphere inside Berlin\u2019s Olympic Stadium in Berlin was electric, with the combination of Netherlands fans dressed all in orange and the vocal backing of Turkey fans \u2013 Germany has a large Turkish diaspora \u2013 for their team providing a dramatic backdrop to the game. The action on the pitch didn\u2019t quite live up to the energy in the stands in the early proceedings though, with both teams struggling to find any cutting edge. Dutch striker Memphis Depay was heavily involved but lacked the cutting edge required to find the back of the net. Demiral had scored with two powerful headers in the win against Austria and Akaydin replicated his absent teammate\u2019s aerial threat by rising highest at the back post to head past Dutch goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen after 19-year-old sensation G\u00fcler had delivered a bewitching cross as Turkey took the lead. After the halftime break, the introduction of Wout Weghorst almost paid immediate dividends for the Netherlands, with his knockdown falling inches away from Depay to tap home. Meanwhile, G\u00fcler remained in the thick of the action with his freekick from distance bending and crashing against the Netherlands\u2019 post as the Real Madrid star continued to impress. Although the Netherlands continued to push, it was Turkey who continued to look the most dangerous team, with Verbruggen having to deny Kenan Y\u0131ld\u0131z midway through the second half. The Netherlands\u2019s equalizer also came from a header with Depay putting in an inviting ball for De Vrij to power past the helpless Mert G\u00fcnok in goal. Minutes later, the Dutch took the lead when an inviting cross from Denzel Dumfries caused panic Turkish box and a combination of Gakpo and Mert M\u00fcld\u00fcr ended with the ball of the back of the net. Turkey ramped up the pressure in search of an equalizrer with Micky van de Ven and Jerdy Schouten having to make a vital blocks to deny shots on goal. Agonizingly for Turkey the ball then hit Semih K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7soy\u2019s knee at the back post and looked to be heading towards the Dutch goal only for Verbruggen to somehow turn it away and let out a cheer of celebration afterwards. As Turkey frantically pushed for a second goal, every small challenge was contested hotly and Bertu\u011f Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m was shown a red card on the bench for his protestations.

This week, more than 200 parliamentary candidates from Macron\u2019s alliance and the left-wing New Popular Front (NFP) stepped down in a bid to avoid splitting the vote in the second round. But as Paris wraps a week of political bargaining, one thing is clear: France \u2013 and the rest of Europe \u2013 must reckon with the prospect of a far-right French government, headed by a popular but untested leader. So, who is Bardella, and what might his party do in power? The only child of Italian immigrants, Bardella was brought up in Seine-Saint-Denis, a working-class suburb of Paris. He joined the RN at 16, and later began a geography degree at the prestigious Sorbonne university, before dropping out to climb the party ranks. He did so briskly. After becoming party spokesperson, he became the RN\u2019s lead candidate for the 2019 European Parliament election at the age of just 23. In 2022, after Le Pen narrowly lost the presidential election to Macron, he succeeded her as party leader, leapfrogging the party\u2019s long standing vice-president and Le Pen\u2019s former partner, Louis Aliot. Freed from the day-to-day management of the party, but almost certain to run again for the presidency in 2027, Le Pen has been able to freshen the RN\u2019s image and untether it from its reputation. Le Pen began her yearslong effort to detoxify the RN by ousting her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen \u2013 a convicted Holocaust denier \u2013 from the party he founded, and later changing its name. The appointment and subsequent rise of Bardella may represent the completion of her mission to bring the party into the modern age. For many older voters, the prospect of a far-right government \u2013 reminiscent of the collaborationist Vichy regime during World War II \u2013 remains terrifying. But among young people, not weighed down by this historical baggage, the party has proved hugely popular. While the RN\u2019s messaging has remained similar, the messenger has changed entirely. Suave, composed, unflappable, a child of the screen generation, Bardella has built up a huge TikTok following, where young voters can watch him tasting wine and doing shots. Even a video of him eating a bon-bon has been viewed 7.5 million times. In just two years, Bardella has helped to give the RN an acceptable \u2013 and potentially electable \u2013 face. Whereas Macron\u2019s Ensemble alliance has sought to distance itself from the president\u2019s image, the RN\u2019s election manifesto is filled with splashy portraits of the prime minister-in-waiting. Fantasy promises? But campaigning and governing require different skills. If he becomes prime minister, Bardella will face the problem common to parties that make the leap from protest vote to credible governing force: How, after making extravagant promises as they rail against the mainstream, to avoid disappointing people once in office? Despite its freshened image, its decades-old philosophy remains the same: Immigrants threaten France\u2019s social fabric. The RN is committed to abolishing the birthright to citizenship for children of foreigners born on French soil, and to discriminate in favor of French citizens in welfare and public employment. But on other things in its 21-page manifesto, the RN is more vague. Detailing how it intends to \u201cpreserve French civilization,\u201d it says it will enact \u201cspecific legislation targeting Islamist ideologies,\u201d without elaborating, and that it will \u201cexperiment with the creation of a voluntary national heritage service.\u201d But already, the RN has begun to temper some of its more extreme nativist positions. After initially advocating to ban dual-citizenship, Bardella softened this stance, but maintained that \u201cthe most strategic positions\u201d within government will be reserved for French citizens. \u201cCan you imagine Franco-Russians working at the Ministry of the Armed Forces today?\u201d he said ahead of the first round. But the party has not yet provided a definition of \u201cstrategic positions.\u201d Could, for instance, the Spanish-born Mayor of Paris Anne Hidalgo remain in post, or would she have to renounce her Spanish citizenship? Mocking the vagueness of the RN\u2019s pledges, Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon \u2013 the far-left leader of the France Unbowed party, which belongs to the New Popular Front coalition \u2013 has asked: \u201cWhat does Mr. Bardella want? We don\u2019t know. He says nothing. He\u2019s a good-looking guy, but what\u2019s his program? Throwing immigrants into the sea.\u201d Critics have said Bardella\u2019s chronic absence from key votes while he was a member of the European Parliament, and his lack of grasp of policy details, make him unfit to govern. In a recent debate with Gabriel Attal, the outgoing French prime minister and Macron\u2019s protege, Bardella confessed, with a smirk, to not having read the text of a bill he had voted against. On the economy, the RN has pledged to slash value-added tax on electricity, fuel and other energy products from 20% to 5.5% and suspend it entirely for scores of basic necessities. While this may be appealing to voters, it has alarmed both Brussels and the financial markets. France is running one of the highest deficits in the eurozone and now risks falling foul of the European Commission\u2019s new fiscal rules, which had been suspended to help countries recover from the Covid-19 pandemic and energy crisis. French government spending could soon be brutally constrained by Brussels, despite the lavish promises of the RN. \u201cTightening will be necessary next year, to bring France into compliance with EU expectations and rules,\u201d Mujtaba Rahman, the managing director for Europe at political risk consultancy the Eurasia Group, told CNN. If the RN falls short of the 289 seats required for an absolute majority, Bardella might choose not to govern. In bullish speeches before the first-round vote, he ruled out leading a minority government, which would require the support of allied parties to pass laws. While France might escape a far-right government for now, it faces the growing prospect of Le Pen becoming president in 2027, and then calling parliamentary elections to see Bardella installed as prime minister. The Meloni model? Since 2022, formerly fringe nativist parties hoping to govern have found a model to follow. After the technocratic government led by Mario Draghi collapsed in Italy, triggering a snap election, Giorgia Meloni became Italian prime minister, becoming the country\u2019s most far-right leader since Benito Mussolini. Before she took office, Rome\u2019s allies thought a hard-right Italian government could compromise Western unity on support for Ukraine, pointing to Matteo Salvini, Meloni\u2019s deputy prime minister and a longtime admirer of Russian President Vladimir Putin who used to don T-shirts emblazoned with his image. But Meloni\u2019s premiership has proven more moderate than many feared at the outset. While she has pursued hard-right policies domestically \u2013 seeking to limit abortion, surrogacy and even removing lesbian mothers\u2019 names from their children\u2019s birth certificates \u2013 she has largely toed a mainstream line on foreign policy issues. Might the RN adopt this bifurcated strategy? The RN is notoriously euroskeptic, but talk of a \u201cFrexit\u201d has cooled - perhaps because Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union proved an act of serious economic self-harm, and perhaps because hard-right leaders \u2013 like Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orban \u2013 have shown it is easier to weaken the bloc from the inside than from without. With that aim, the RN has promised to cut funding to the EU by up to 3 billion euros ($3.2 billion), partly to fund tax cuts at home. But, with EU budgets agreed on a seven-year basis and the current one running until 2027, the RN cannot legally renege on France\u2019s spending commitments. Bardella has also ruled out sending French troops to Ukraine \u2013 an idea floated by Macron \u2013 and said he would not allow Kyiv to use French military equipment to strike targets inside Russia. But a Bardella premiership could tip France into a constitutional crisis. While the National Assembly is responsible for passing domestic laws and the prime minister controls the budget, the president determines the country\u2019s foreign, Europe and defense policy. When the prime minister and president belong to different parties \u2013 in a rare arrangement known as \u201ccohabitation\u201d \u2013 things can grind to a halt. With Macron set to see out his term, which finishes in 2027, the line between domestic and foreign issues may become blurred. If Macron pursues a foreign policy that requires parliament to pass large spending bills, it is not clear whose preferences would prevail: his or Bardella\u2019s.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/europe/jordan-bardella-national-rally-france-profile-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "world"}}

Their peaceful green campaigns have been championed by climate activist Greta Thunberg and in 2015, they successfully fought against a plan for a hydroelectric dam they claim would have damaged a pristine rainforest valley. But this week, the Southeast Asian nation sentenced 10 activists from the group Mother Nature Cambodia to up to six years in prison each on charges of conspiring against the state. The government says the group encourages social unrest, but to their supporters, the ruling is just the latest in a pattern of attacks on climate activists in the wider region. \u201cWe demand that our friends in Mother Nature Cambodia, and all political prisoners, be released immediately,\u201d said Fridays for Future, the youth-led global climate strike movement founded by Thunberg, in a statement. Exiled opposition leader Mu Sochua said the group had tried to highlight environmental issues that \u201cthreaten Cambodia\u2019s fragile environment\u201d and claimed, \u201cthey would be heroes in any free country.\u201d \u201cTheir convictions only show how Cambodian courts are simply being used as weapons (by the state) to halt any kind of public discussion,\u201d Mu Sochua told CNN. \u201cThe sentences are a disaster for environmentalism in Cambodia and for people everywhere, who care about the future of our planet.\u201d Cambodia, a kingdom of nearly 17 million people that is rich in natural resources, faces pressing threats to its environment, including deforestation from illegal logging and agricultural expansion, water pollution affecting inland and coastal areas, and a surge in plastic waste. The country maintains about 46% forest cover and is home to 2,300 plant species and 14 endangered animals, according to the United States Agency for International Development. \u201cDeforestation and wildlife crimes continue to threaten Cambodia\u2019s forests and biodiversity,\u201d USAID says on its website Critics and environmental groups say those threats have heightened under the nearly four-decade-long rule of strongman Hun Sen \u2013 who has quashed dissent and jailed opponents in recent years, forcing many to flee overseas. Though his eldest son, Hun Manet, succeeded him as prime minister last year, Hun Sen is still widely seen as the ruling party\u2019s center of power. \u201cLike what we are seeing with dictators in other countries, Cambodia is becoming more repressed,\u201d said Alejandro Gonzalez-Davidson, a Spaniard who co-founded Mother Nature Cambodia over a decade ago, alongside local Cambodian activists. Climate activism in the country is at a \u201crougher, grassroots level,\u201d he added, with the conversation centering more on \u201cextremely rich and powerful tycoons and corrupt government officials trying to exploit and privatize,\u201d the environment. \u201cThis is Cambodia now \u2013 logging, poaching, mineral extraction, turning lakes into land and destroying rivers, as well as exporting massive amounts of sands. There are systems in place where (officials) exploit the environment for profit and our group has been doing as much as we can to stop these unethical projects and protect the environment \u2013 and that is why we are a threat in the regime\u2019s eyes.\u201d CNN has reached out to the Cambodian government for comment on the court ruling and allegations in this story. Outside the court ahead of Tuesday\u2019s ruling, a government spokesperson denied that the charges against the activists were politically motivated. \u201cThe government has never taken action against those who criticize. We only take action against those who commit crimes,\u201d spokesperson Pen Bona told Reuters. Award-winning campaigners Founded in 2012, Mother Nature Cambodia has campaigned against environmental destruction and exposed alleged corruption in state management of precious mineral resources, and their savvy use of social media has resonated with young Cambodians. In 2023, the group was awarded the Right Livelihood Award, often called the \u201calternative Nobel Prize.\u201d \u201cMother Nature Cambodia is a group of fearless young activists fighting for environmental rights and democracy in the face of repression by the Cambodian regime,\u201d the jury said in a speech at the time, describing them as \u201ca powerful voice for environmental preservation and democracy in Cambodia.\u201d Several activists were unable to receive the award in person as Cambodian courts denied their requests to travel to Sweden to collect the prize. \u201cThey have successfully helped local communities stop environmental violations,\u201d Right Livelihood\u2019s executive director Ole von Uexkuell said last year. \u201cThrough innovative and often humorous protests, their activism defends nature and livelihoods while upholding communities\u2019 voices against corrupt and damaging products.\u201d The group has strongly leveraged social media, saying it helps get their message across to young supporters. They have more than 450,000 followers on Facebook, the most widely used social platform in the country. But it\u2019s on TikTok that their videos really make an impression on young Cambodian users like Run Bunry, a high-school student from the capital Phnom Penh and his friends. \u201cThey are positive and lighthearted and also teach us a lot about the environment,\u201d he said. One video, highlighting an investigation into the alleged illegal export of rare silica sand, showed three members buried up to their heads in sand and was shared more than 1,000 times. Another viral video taken along a beach in the coastal city Sihanoukville showed the extent of alleged illegal construction by hotels and casinos on the shore. \u201cFollower numbers have grown especially in the last five years and a lot of our old content regularly resurfaces on TikTok and goes viral,\u201d said founding member Gonzalez-Davidson, who was expelled from Cambodia in 2015 after the group\u2019s successful campaign to stop a Chinese-funded hydropower dam from being built over the Areng Valley, an area of pristine rainforest in southwest Cambodia. Members of the group say they have faced increasing threats, harassment and criminal charges for years. Under scorching heat on Tuesday, members of the group \u2013 dressed in white and accompanied by a crowd of supporters \u2013 staged a mock funeral procession in the streets leading to the Phnom Penh Municipal Court. But peaceful scenes descended into chaos after the sentencing was announced. Video footage showed activists Mother Nature Cambodia activists Ly Chandaravuth, Long Kunthea, Thun Ratha, Phuon Keoraksmey and Yim Leanghy surrounded by dozens of armed police officers and dragged away into waiting cars, bound for prisons across the country. Rights activist Pilorge Naly of NGO the Cambodian League for the Promotion and Defence of Human Rights was at the scene and told CNN the arrests were immediate and violent. Journalists and supporters were also pushed and shoved by security officers, she said. Arrest warrants have been issued for five other members of the group, including Gonzalez-Davidson, who was sentenced to eight years in prison Tuesday on the conspiracy charge and insulting Cambodia\u2019s king. \u201cThe increasing use by Cambodian authorities of l\u00e8se majest\u00e9 and other articles of Cambodia\u2019s criminal code to penalise the exercise of human rights is deeply worrying,\u201d United Nations Human Rights spokesperson Thameen Al-Kheetan said in a statement following the ruling. Gonzalez-Davidson, however, said the ruling would backfire against the authorities and inspire a new cohort of environmental campaigners. \u201cThis week, a new generation of Cambodian activists was born \u2013 one that did not exist back in 2012,\u201d he said. \u201cMany young Cambodians are very engaged in the next steps and public campaigning must continue. There have been (arrests and jailings) before and each time, we come out stronger. \u201cThey won\u2019t break our spirits. We are not going to be shut down.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/06/asia/mother-nature-cambodia-climate-youth-activists-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "world_africa_bananas-artificial-hair-cheverux-organique-spc", "text": "During a visit to a local farm while working with development agency USAID, Ugandan entrepreneur Juliet Tumusiime realized that a huge amount of banana stems are left over from banana cultivation and simply discarded. Looking for a way to use the waste, she struck upon an innovative business idea. Almost a decade later, now aged 42, Tumusiime is the chief executive and co-founder of Cheveux Organique, which manufactures hair made from banana fibers as an alternative to synthetic extensions. Fashion trends among the younger population and growing purchasing power have boosted the market for hair extensions and wigs in the Africa and the Middle East, which could be worth $710 million by 2028, according to Research and Markets. Extensions are typically made from human hair, or synthetic materials such as nylon, polyester, acrylic and PVC. Synthetics are popular in Uganda because they\u2019re much cheaper, but they\u2019re not biodegradable or easy to recycle. Some people complain that synthetic hair can irritate their scalp and a study of synthetic hair in Nigeria found the presence of potentially harmful heavy metals and chemicals. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to friends, colleagues, both men and women and asked them how they dispose of their hair when they take it out,\u201d Tumusiime says. \u201cA lot of the time it is just thrown in the trash. The level of awareness is really low - most people don\u2019t realize that they are wearing plastic on their head which can irritate the skin and cause pollution. \u201cOur mission is to transform the beauty industry by providing alternatives that benefit their health and the environment. We want to empower women to make informed decisions about what hair they use and what\u2019s best for them.\u201d Tumusiime says that, unlike synthetic hair, her product is biodegradable, durable and can be easily styled, treated and colored. It can also be rewashed with warm water and conditioned with detangling cream. When dry, the hypoallergenic hair can be oiled and can withstand dryers and heat up to 400 degrees, lasting weeks longer than synthetic alternatives, according to Tumusiime. Since it\u2019s made from discarded banana stems, she adds, it\u2019s also a way to help curb that waste. Uganda is Africa\u2019s largest producer and consumer of bananas, producing about 10 million metric tons of bananas per day. Ugandans consume almost one kilogram of the fruit per person, per day, with more than 75% of the population relying on bananas as a staple food, according to the World Economic Forum. Cheveux Organique works closely with local banana farmers, buying stems that would otherwise be discarded. The stems are split and the fibers extracted by machine. The extracted fibers are then dried and treated, before being combed out, resulting in the hair-like texture. The \u201chair\u201d is dyed into three shades: Cheveux Black, Cheveux Brown and Cheveux Blonde. Tumusiime says it has a natural sheen, is soft to the touch and can be used for braiding and styling. It\u2019s also suitable for warm and humid climates, she notes. The company isn\u2019t unique in creating plant-based hair. In the US, St.Louis-based Rebundle also sells hair extensions made from banana fibers, while Nourie Hair offers a hair alternative for braiding made from Ginseng root extract and rosemary. However, turning banana waste into a premium product does not come without challenges for Cheveux Organique. \u201cThe labor-intensive process, from picking the stems, transporting them to the facility, extracting the stems, treating them and the power needed to use this \u2013 it causes the product to become pricey,\u201d Tumusiime says. Cheveux Organique sells its plant-based hair in Uganda, and as fair afield as the US, France and the UK. It retails for $50 for 150 grams (5.3 ounces), which Tumusiime says is cheaper than a typical $185 for a similar amount of human hair. But synthetic hair can be bought for as little as $1 for a bundle. \u201cThis is something that we are hugely concerned about, and we are trying to find ways to mechanize the business and produce volumes of hair whilst continuing to break even,\u201d Tumusiime says. \u201cThe people paying these prices are getting a premium product at the end of it \u2013 and it\u2019s about the long-term benefits that this product brings.\u201d Tumusiime says her startup, which currently employs 25 permanent staff members and 100 part-time workers for waste gathering, is in the process of creating regional hubs, which will function as extraction centers, as well as an education point for young people. The hubs will train future generations on the positive impacts of waste management, as well as giving young people skillsets \u2013 such as extraction and machine operation \u2013 that will equip them for future careers. \u201cWe want to make sure that this brand is a household name,\u201d Tumusiime says. \u201cWe want to become leaders in this industry despite challenges. But I\u2019m passionate about what I\u2019m doing. I\u2019m not about to give up. I do everything possible to make sure that I achieve my objectives and achieve the vision for which I started this organization.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/world/africa/bananas-artificial-hair-cheverux-organique-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "world"}}

The change in Hamas\u2019 position was first reported by Reuters, and comes amid intensified efforts towards reaching an agreement.\u00a0The group has long demanded Israel agree to a permanent ceasefire before signing any deal, terms Israel sees as unacceptable. The apparent willingness to compromise raises the possibility a deal could be reached. Hamas would instead accept that talks on reaching a permanent ceasefire would take place throughout the first phase of any deal, which would last six weeks, the official told CNN. The Hamas official \u2013 who is a member of the negotiating team \u2013 confirmed to CNN that mediators would guarantee a temporary truce, the delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza and the withdrawal of Israeli troops so long as indirect talks continued on implementing the second phase of the agreement. The Hamas official, who declined to be named, said Hamas accepted a proposal to begin talks on releasing Israeli men and soldiers held in Gaza no later than 16 days after the first phase of the agreement begins to be implemented. Israeli media previously reported that a draft Israeli plan laid out\u00a0terms for a similar agreement. The draft stipulates that \u201cno later than the 16th day, indirect negotiations will begin between the two parties to conclude the conditions for the implementation of phase 2 of this agreement. The negotiations should be completed before the end of the 5th week of the first phase.\u201d The Israeli Prime Minister\u2019s Office (PMO) has not confirmed the authenticity of that draft. Indirect negotiations between an Israeli team and Hamas resumed in Qatar this week after Prime Minister Netanyahu authorized his negotiators to enter into detailed negotiations to try and broker a deal. Mossad director David Barea was in Qatar\u00a0to meet with the mediators and discuss the details of a potential new framework agreement for a ceasefire and hostage release deal. Upon his return, the PMO issued a statement saying \u201cthere are still gaps\u201d between the parties. Efforts to reach a deal between Hamas and Israel have stalled for months. Netanyahu \u2013 who faces competing pressure from far-right cabinet ministers and family members of hostages to secure their release - has said Israel won\u2019t stop fighting until Hamas is destroyed. A three-phase Israeli proposal was unveiled by US President Joe Biden in May, setting conditions intended to lead to the eventual release of all remaining hostages, in return for a permanent ceasefire and withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. Israel launched its offensive in Gaza following Hamas\u2019s October 7 attacks, which left around 1,200 dead.

The items repatriated from New York\u2019s\u00a0Metropolitan Museum of Art arrived Wednesday and were displayed to journalists and VIPs on Thursday at the National Museum in the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh. They \u201cwere made between the 9th and 14th centuries in the Angkorian period and reflect the Hindu and Buddhist religious systems prevailing at that time,\u201d the museum said in a statement. A statement from Cambodia\u2019s Ministry of Culture and Fine Arts said the \u201chistoric homecoming of national treasures\u201d followed several years of negotiations between Cambodia\u2019s art restitution team, United States federal prosecutors in New York, investigators from the US Department of Homeland Security and the Metropolitan Museum. The culture minister added that the return of the artifacts was very important to the Cambodian people for recalling the heritage of their ancestors through good times and bad. \u201cThe pieces were staying a long, long time abroad, but today they returned to Cambodia, like a blessing for our people for peace, stability in our country now,\u201d said Sackona, adding that to Cambodians, the returned artworks carry with them the souls of their ancestors. Bringing back the souls of ancestors also includes bringing history, admiration and knowledge, she explained, noting that Cambodia hopes to soon receive another 50 artifacts from the US. Cambodia claims that other items illegally trafficked from the country are still at the Metropolitan Museum, as well as at other museums and in the hands of private collectors. \u201cThese returns contribute to the reconciliation and healing of the Cambodian people, who endured decades of civil war and suffered tremendously from the tragedy of the Khmer Rouge regime,\u201d Sackona said. \u201cThey also demonstrate the truly positive partnership we have developed with the United States.\u201d For the art world, their return is the fruit of a reckoning in recent years over art and archaeological treasures taken from their homelands. These include not only ancient Asian artworks, but also pieces lost or stolen during turmoil in other places, such as Syria, Iraq and Nazi-occupied Europe. The pieces returned to Cambodia from the Met were looted during a long period of civil war and instability in Cambodia, which was ruled by the brutal communist\u00a0Khmer Rouge regime\u00a0in the 1970s. They were bought and trafficked by well-known art dealer Douglas Latchford, who was indicted in 2019 for allegedly orchestrating a multiyear scheme to sell looted Cambodian antiquities on the international art market. Latchford, who died the following year, had denied any involvement in smuggling. Cambodia\u2019s Culture Ministry highlighted two works among those returned that are expected to be restored by reuniting them with other parts already in their possession. The repatriation includes the \u201cextraordinary\u201d stone sculpture from the 10th century of the female goddess Uma from the ancient royal capital of Koh Ker, it said, adding that the sculpture\u2019s foot had already been retrieved from its original site. \u201cAt last, the Uma can be reunified to achieve its full magnificence as one complete statue,\u201d it said. \u201cMoreover, a significant returned artifact is a 10th century bronze head of the deity Avalokiteshvara, which the Ministry highly anticipates finally being reunited with its matching torso, currently on display at the National Museum of Cambodia.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/style/cambodia-statue-repatriation-met-museum/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "world"}}

CNN cannot independently verify the Israeli military\u2019s claim. UNRWA Communication Director Juliette Touma told CNN UNRWA does not have all the information yet, adding that half of UNRWA\u2019s facilities in Gaza have been hit since October 7. \u201cAt least 500 people sheltering in those (UNRWA) facilities have been killed, many were women and children,\u201d she added.

A senior Hamas official told CNN the militant group was ready to reconsider its insistence that Israel commit to a permanent ceasefire in Gaza before signing an agreement that would usher in a temporary truce and begin a process to release hostages. Meanwhile, the near-weekly demonstrations against the Israeli government continued on Saturday. Thousands gathered in Tel Aviv\u2019s Democracy Square to call for new elections and the release of hostages amid discontent with how Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has handled issues including the war in Gaza. Israeli police said in a statement that two protesters were arrested at the Tel Aviv demonstration, citing violations of public order and unsafe behavior, including \u201clighting bonfires on the road.\u201d The police said they deployed in large forces to maintain security and order and dispersed the demonstration after protesters illegally gathered on Menachem Begin Road and tried to block it, despite initial approval for the protest. Protesters waved Israeli flags and held signs criticizing Netanyahu, while police used water cannons to disperse demonstrators blocking the traffic on the Ayalon Highway. \u201cAfter most of the protesters dispersed naturally and in light of the violations of order by a handful of protesters, the police had to declare an illegal demonstration,\u201d the police said. \u201cDuring the dispersal of the rioters, the police arrested two suspects.\u201d The Israeli police further warned that it \u201cwill act with zero tolerance towards those who disrupt the order and will not listen to the policemen\u2019s instructions.\u201d The chairman of Israel\u2019s National Unity and former war cabinet minister, Benny Gantz, was seen participating in a rally calling for the return of the hostages. The often-weekly demonstrations have yet to change the political landscape, and Netanyahu still controls a stable majority in parliament.

{"id": "2024_05_25_style_zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk", "text": "Above Beijing\u2019s imperial center rises Jingshan, or Prospect Hill. From a pagoda at its modest peak, a panoramic view of the city presents itself. To the south, the dull golden roofs of the Forbidden City crest and fall, pulling the eye southward to Tiananmen \u2014 the Gate of Heavenly Peace \u2014 and the vast square of the same name just beyond. To the east stand the smooth metallic skyscrapers of the city\u2019s business district. To the north, at the top of Beijing\u2019s central axis \u2014 its so-called dragon\u2019s vein \u2014 sit the Bell and Drum Towers, which once acted as the city\u2019s collective timepiece. And stretching all along the western periphery are the calm, tree-lined waters of the manmade lakes, dug by hand for the pleasure of past emperors. It\u2019s this aerial view of \u201cZhongnanhai,\u201d meaning \u201cmiddle and southern seas,\u201d and the surrounding buildings that today\u2019s Chinese leaders prefer you did not see. That\u2019s because the 1,500-acre site of repurposed imperial pavilions and temples, along with gray modern offices has formed the leadership compound for the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP)  since 1950. As the seat of power, Zhongnanhai is often thought of as China\u2019s equivalent to the White House, or the Kremlin. Synonymous with China\u2019s communist party elite, and among the country\u2019s most secretive places, it is ringed by a centuries-old red ochre wall, with countless CCTV cameras periscoping above it \u2014 and patrolled assiduously by security forces in both plain clothes and uniform. A peaceful getaway For Chinese leader Xi Jinping\u2019s imperial forebears, the site served a somewhat different function. While emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties ruled their vast kingdom from within the Forbidden City, they built temples, halls and living quarters in Zhongnanhai; less grandly ceremonial than those of the palace, they were often oriented to take advantage of the views afforded by the area\u2019s tranquil waters and carefully planned gardens. Many of these emperors came to favor passing their days surrounded by drooping willows in the cool and quiet of this cultivated pleasure garden. A story relayed by the scholar Geremie Barm\u00e9 in his book \u201cThe Forbidden City\u201d tells of the 18th-century Qianlong Emperor\u2019s daily routine at Zhongnanhai: Each morning, after a first breakfast of cold swallows nest soup, he would travel by heated palanquin to the gardens\u2019\u00a0Studio of Convivial Delight,\u00a0a pavilion he built to capitalize on the view of the South Lake, where he would breakfast again on a meal of\u00a018 dishes. As the historian and author of \u201cThe Shortest History of China,\u201d Linda Jaivin, told CNN via email: \u201cThere is something outrageous and yet poetic about the incredible coordination and effort required of a team of bearers, cooks and attendants, just so that an emperor could come, catch a view of the magnificent Ocean Terrace, scoff his food and (leave).\u201d The first ruler to view Zhongnanhai as primarily a place to govern from, not simply relax in, was the Empress Dowager Cixi, who effectively controlled China for almost five decades from 1861. She lived for many years in the gardens\u2019 Hall of Ceremonial Phoenixes, which became the center of political authority in China. She would die there in 1908. The serene surroundings of Zhongnanhai also became, under Cixi, a place of punishment and confinement. In 1898, following attempted reforms that displeased her, Cixi imprisoned her nephew, the Guangxu Emperor, on Yingtai Island, which juts out into the southern lake. Built as a miniature version of the mythical Penglai island, home to the immortals of Chinese legend, the tiny piece of land would become the emperor\u2019s home for most of his life, bar a brief period when the Boxer rebellion of 1900 forced the whole court to flee the capital. He would die on Yingtai Island from arsenic poisoning the day before the Empress Dowager herself. His imprisonment and death, said writer M. A. Aldrich, author of \u201cThe Search for a Vanishing Beijing: A Guide to China\u2019s Capital Through the Ages,\u201d perhaps adds a touch of poignancy for any subsequent resident of Zhongnanhai. \u201cIn addition to being a site that preserves sites of imperial splendor,\u201d he told CNN, \u201cit also functions as a reminder to the political elite about the consequences for stepping out of line.\u201d For Aldrich, however, the Zhongnanhai compound also represents the destructive impulses of the CCP towards its adopted capital in the years after 1949, when Mao Zedong proclaimed the foundation of the People\u2019s Republic. \u201cAs a political symbol of the New China, it has been torn up, rebuilt, expanded, and revamped so many times that its connection with its elegant past has been lost,\u201d Aldrich said. Architectural changes There have been serious revisions to the architecture of Zhongnanhai since the end of imperial rule in 1912. After the last emperor abdicated the throne, China\u2019s new president Yuan Shikai granted him the right to live on the northern section of the Forbidden City \u2014 and then took Zhongnanhai to be his new administration\u2019s headquarters. The changes he made to the imperial gardens were disparaged by many of the Westerners who visited them. \u201cWhatever may be one\u2019s opinion as to whether Yuan Shikai \u2018exalted his aim\u2019 in his political career, he certainly cannot be said to have done so as builder and architect,\u201d wrote L.C. Arlington and William Lewisohn in their 1935 book \u201cIn Search of Old Peking,\u201d \u201cfor all the buildings that have been erected or restored by him are in the worst possible taste.\u201d Most notable of these changes \u2014 at least to ordinary Beijingers \u2014 was the repurposing of a two-story pavilion at the very south of the gardens. Known as the Precious Moon Tower, it had been built decades earlier by the Qianlong Emperor for a homesick lover, a Muslim woman from Xinjiang, taken to Beijing as part of the spoils of war. The concubine would gaze south from the tower toward a mock mosque and bazaar the emperor had especially constructed to assuage her longing for home. Yuan refashioned this pavilion into the main entrance to his presidential compound, and established a tall watchtower just to its east. The gate was named Xinhuamen, or the Gate of New China. Today, the structure remains coated in the same deep red that graces the walls of all Beijing\u2019s imperial buildings, with a roof of glazed yellow tiles and detailing that runs below the roofline, picked out in blue and gold. The gate is now flanked by two red banners that speak to its modern purpose as China\u2019s political and party headquarters: \u201cLong Live the Great Communist Party of China\u201d reads one; and \u201cLong Live the Invincible Mao Zedong Thought\u201d on the other. On a screen wall recessed behind the entrance way, Chinese characters written in Mao\u2019s own calligraphic style declare: \u201cServe the People.\u201d Facing out onto Beijing\u2019s main east-west thoroughfare, the gate remains the most conspicuous part of Zhongnanhai. The rest of the compound has, since 1989, been firmly off-limits to the Chinese public. Seat of power Initially, after the communist victory in China\u2019s civil war in 1949, Mao Zedong took up residence at Shuangqing Villa in Fragrant Hills, another former imperial garden to the west of Beijing. Though wary of establishing himself in the imperial heart of Beijing \u2014 it is said that he refused ever to enter the Forbidden City, for fear of being associated with the power structures of old, feudal China he had fought to overthrow \u2014 Mao ultimately moved into Zhongnanhai and, in late 1949, he set up in the\u00a0Garden of Abundant Beneficence,\u00a0a large courtyard compound favored by both the Qianlong and Kangxi emperors, where he would hold court with dignitaries\u00a0and live\u00a0until 1966. Having re-established Zhongnanhai as a center of political power in the new China, Mao set about rebuilding the compound according to his tastes. \u201cSince 1949, an assortment of new architecture styles has encroached into Zhongnanhai, with a tennis court, gymnasium, swimming pools and Western buildings topped off with Chinese eave roofs adding a discordant note that would not have been appreciated by its traditionally-minded original owners,\u201d said Aldrich. In 1966, Mao moved from the Garden of Abundant Beneficence to a specially built house beside his beloved indoor swimming pool. He often summoned officials to speak to him as he bobbed in the water \u2014 and famously received Russian leader Nikita Khrushchev at his pool during a 1958 visit. \u201cTheir interpreters had to pace alongside the edge of the pool,\u201d said Jaivin. \u201cThe Russian couldn\u2019t swim and had to wear water wings. Mao loved both swimming and putting Khrushchev in his place. Finally, Khrushchev got sick of it, and clambered out to sit on the edge, dangling his feet in the water.\u201d In the residence next door, Mao lined his rooms with bookshelves housing an extensive library of Chinese classical literature. \u201cIt was here,\u201d noted Aldrich, \u201cwith the background trappings of a scholar, that he met Nixon and Kissinger in 1972.\u201d Most subsequent leaders have preferred to keep a house outside the Zhongnanhai compound. Deng Xiaoping lived, from 1977, in a courtyard house on a nearby lane adjacent to Beihai, the \u201cNorthern Sea\u201d of central Beijing\u2019s chain of lakes. While not officially disclosed, it is believed that more contemporary leaders, including Xi Jinping and his predecessors Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, have maintained homes in an exclusive gated compound in Jade Spring Hill, sometimes called the \u201cback garden\u201d of Chinese politics, out to the city\u2019s west. Aldrich noted that those leaders and party cadres who used Zhongnanhai as their primary residence often attracted unwelcome scrutiny for their activities, particularly during years of political turbulence. \u201cIn his memoirs, Chairman Mao\u2019s physician, Li Zhisui, commented that (the complex\u2019s) residents were always under surveillance,\u201d Aldrich said. \u201cDuring the Cultural Revolution, the simple act of making a fire would bring down the wrath of the security guards on the perpetrator. It was believed that such a fire was proof that incriminating or seditious materials were being destroyed.\u201d The imperial gardens offering vistas of Zhongnanhai\u2019s lakes have, today, been filled in with dozens of gray offices and meeting halls, many of which date to 1970s, when Zhongnanhai underwent significant razing and renovation \u2014 the rebuilding was so extensive that one visitor in 1979 described the grounds resembling a construction site, with muddy roads that were impossible to walk on. The contemporary compound splits roughly in two, with the northern buildings, on the banks of the \u201cmiddle lake,\u201d used as the headquarters of China\u2019s top executive body, the State Council. It is here that foreign dignitaries are admitted. Around the \u201csouthern lake,\u201d meanwhile, are the headquarters of the CCP, including, within Qinzheng Hall (the Hall of Diligent Government), the offices of the general secretary of the party (a post currently held by Xi). Many of the most historically significant political events to occur at Zhongnanhai have taken place in Huairen Hall, or the Hall of Cherished Compassion, on the western side of the Middle Lake. The hall was added to the imperial park during the late Qing dynasty, but was then extensively remodeled by the CCP in the early 1950s to impart a more august socialist grandeur. It is a broad, imposing ceremonial hall with staggered roofs of glazed green tiles falling in curved lines to upturned corners; the facade of austere grey brick is interrupted by red wooden pillars, windows and doors. The building\u2019s capacious interior houses a large auditorium, as well as numerous smaller meeting rooms. The hall has, for decades, served as the main meeting place for China\u2019s Politburo, the party\u2019s decision-making body usually comprising about two dozen members. On occasion, it has also hosted the Politburo\u2019s Standing Committee, the core of China\u2019s political elite, (the power of both bodies has notably dwindled in the era of Xi), though they most commonly meet in Qinzheng Hall, close to the general secretary\u2019s office. During the tumult of the Cultural Revolution vital discussions and debates occurred at Huairen Hall, and, in the months after its conclusion, it was there that three of the so-called Gang of Four \u2014 the political faction that included Mao\u2019s wife held responsible for the worst excesses of the era \u2014 were arrested, tricked into attending a meeting they thought was about the publication of the fifth volume of Mao\u2019s Selected Works. In April 1989, former party head Hu Yaobang suffered a heart-attack during a Politburo meeting at Huairen; his death a week later would trigger the Tiananmen Square protests that the government forcibly cracked down on in early June of that year. However, the compound hasn\u2019t always been so forbidden for the masses following the collapse of China\u2019s imperial dynasty. In the late 1920s, it became a park, with tourists allowed to boat on and swim in the lakes, while in the 1980s, the public could access some of its scenic and historical spots, including\u00a0Mao\u2019s\u00a0former residence, on\u00a0organized weekend tours.\u00a0Even early in 1989, a journalist for the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0was able to casually\u00a0drive\u00a0a senior official into the compound and drop him off inside.\u00a0During a period of warmer US and China relations in 2011, former Chinese president\u00a0Hu Jintao\u00a0invited\u00a0a group of American high school students to Zhongnanhai. Modern security concerns Today, Zhongnanhai is more closely-guarded than ever, though the inexorable development of the city has caused problems in maintaining the compound\u2019s secrecy. When an annex to the nearby Beijing Hotel was built in\u00a01973, authorities were panicked by the realization that from its upper floors one could quite easily see \u2013 and potentially target a sniper rifle \u2013 into Zhongnanhai. A building was hastily erected on the western edge of the Forbidden City to restrict this view. Likewise in 2018, when Beijing\u2019s new tallest building was\u00a0completed\u00a0\u2013 the 528-meter Citic tower, better known as the \u201cZun\u201d \u2013 the country\u2019s national security apparatus reportedly requisitioned the top floors amid fears that visitors or occupants might be able to spy into the compound. Beijing authorities did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on the security situation at the time. Zhongnanhai\u2019s entrance, Xinhuamen, has also been the site of repeated demonstrations in recent decades; in 1989, it was a gathering point for students taking part in the Tiananmen protests, whilst in 1999, more than 10,000 members of the since-banned Falun Gong gathered on the sidewalks near Zhongnanhai to protest their treatment at the hands of the government. So, while Zhongnanhai is sometimes compared to the White House, Aldrich argues that the paranoia with which the compound is today guarded makes it more like the imperial palace of centuries past: \u201cSince ordinary people are not allowed to enter Zhongnanhai, it is probably more appropriate to describe it as a \u2018New Forbidden City\u2019 for China\u2019s ruling elite rather than a place with a personal political resonance for the average citizen,\u201d he said. \u201cHeck, even the Kremlin is open to tourists!\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/style/zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "world"}}

The 66-mile (106-kilometer) hike through the Darien Gap brings migrants from Colombia to Panama and is a crucial passage for those hoping to reach the United States and Canada. News of the agreement comes after Panama\u2019s new President Jose Raul Mulino vowed on Monday that the Central American nation would no longer be a country of transit for migrants. \u201cI will not allow Panama to be a path open to thousands of people who enter our country illegally supported by an entire international organization related to drug and human trafficking,\u201d Mulino said at his swearing-in ceremony. \u201cPanama will no longer be a transit country for illegals,\u201d he said amid cheers from those present. \u201cThe numbers of illegal immigrants passing through the Dari\u00e9n are shocking,\u201d Mulino said, adding that he intends to \u201cappeal to international solidarity regarding the cause that generates the problem and will seek solutions with the countries involved, especially with the United States, which is the final destination of such immigrants.\u201d Mulino said that he\u2019s seen first-hand \u201cthe magnitude of the problem and the dimension of the humanitarian and environmental crisis\u201d that migration causes to the Dari\u00e9n Gap. \u201cThe Dari\u00e9n must continue to be a great green lung, not only for us but for the entire region.

The painting depicts Jesus, Mary and Joseph resting on their way to Egypt after learning that Herod, King of Judea, wanted to kill the young Christ. Titian, whose real name was Tiziano Vecellio, made the work in the first decade of the 16th century, at the beginning of his career. Measuring just 18.25 inches by 24.75 inches (46.2 centimeters x 62.9 centimeters), the painting is tiny compared with some of the massive works for which Titian became known later in his life. The oil-on-canvas work has a remarkable history. After changing hands among various European aristocrats, the painting was looted by Napoleonic troops during the French occupation of Vienna in 1809 and taken to Paris. It was returned to Vienna in 1815 and again moved through private collections before ending up with John Alexander Thynne, 4th Marquess of Bath, in Wiltshire, England. In 1995, it was stolen from Longleat, the home of Thynne\u2019s descendants, and disappeared for seven years, before it was found at a bus stop in London by art detective Charles Hill.

The report from the Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict (IPAC) confirmed the authenticity of a June 30 video statement by 16 Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) leaders announcing they were dissolving the extremist network. In the statement, captured on video and shared online, the leaders confirmed their commitment to the Indonesian state and law, and said all material taught in JI-affiliated boarding schools would be in line with orthodox Islam. \u201cIt is too early to say what the consequences are, but the men who signed the statement have enough respect and credibility within the organisation to ensure widespread acceptance,\u201d said Sidney Jones, who authored IPAC\u2019s preliminary analysis. The Al-Qaeda-linked militant group is accused of orchestrating some of the deadliest attacks in Indonesia, including the 2002 bombing of Bali nightclubs that killed more than 200 people. Indonesia\u2019s National Counter Terrorism Agency (BNPT) declined to comment on the development, but said it planned to hold a press conference soon. The decision to disband the organization, said Jones, was likely driven by several factors, including the influence of intellectuals within JI who were less interested in violent jihad, and a cost-benefit analysis on the best way to protect the group\u2019s biggest assets \u2013 its schools. Intensive engagement with counter-terrorism officials also played a role, the report said. Despite the clout of the figures involved, IPAC noted the group has a history of splinters and it was possible one could emerge in the future, although probably not immediately. \u201cFor the moment, the likely result is the flourishing of JI-affiliated schools and the increasing involvement in public life of the men who signed the 30 June statement,\u201d said IPAC. \u201cWhat happens to the rest of the membership remains to be seen.\u201d Adhe Bhakti, a terrorism expert at the Jakarta-based Center for Radicalism and Deradicalization Studies, said he doubted the group\u2019s splinter factions would follow their seniors.

The list includes customarily hot Las Vegas, where temperatures are expected to be near 114 degrees Saturday and even hotter Sunday, when it could break the daily record of 116. Nearly 130 million people in both the West and East are under heat alerts across 18 states and the District of Columbia. \u201cThese conditions will be extremely dangerous and potentially deadly if not taken seriously,\u201d meteorologists with the National Weather Service\u2019s Weather Prediction Center said in a forecast discussion. \u201cThe multi-day nature of the heat and record warm overnight temperatures will cause heat stress to build in people without adequate cooling and hydration.\u201d The dangerous heat will expand into the Intermountain West and northern High Plains by next week, forecasters say. Extreme heat\u00a0is one of the leading weather-related killers in the United States, leaving hundreds of people dead each year, according to the\u00a0weather service. In\u00a0San\u00a0Jose, California, a homeless man\u00a0died Tuesday due to the extreme heat, Mayor Matt Mahan said.\u00a0The man was 69, according to the mayor\u2019s spokesperson, Tasha Dean, citing information from the\u00a0Santa Clara Medical Examiner\u2019s Office. The same day, a 10-year-old\u00a0died in Arizona\u00a0after experiencing a heat-related emergency while hiking with family in South Mountain Park and Preserve, the Phoenix Police Department said. Also in Arizona, a 69-year-old hiker from Austin, Texas, died last week after hiking at the Grand Canyon, according to the National Park Service. Heat was a contributing factor, officials said. Major to extreme heat risk, the highest 2 levels, are expected for much of California and the Southwest on Saturday and Sunday, meaning health impacts from heat become more likely in anyone without adequate hydration or cooling. Even in the Pacific Northwest, the heat is punishing Parts of Oregon will experience triple digits up to five days with poor overnight relief, the\u00a0National Weather Service in Portland\u00a0said Friday.

Other areas of the West were experiencing unusual heat. Palm Springs, California, reached 124 degrees Friday afternoon, exceeding the previous all-time record high for the date of 123 degrees set in 2021. An all-time record high of 105 set in 2012 was broken in Raleigh, North Carolina, where temperatures of 106 degrees were recorded Friday.

Conditions ripe for wildfire spread The extreme heat \u2013 combined with gusty winds and low humidity \u2013 means any wildfires that start will spread quickly through already parched vegetation. Red flag warnings are in effect through Saturday night across the West, including in the area of the\u00a0Thompson Fire, which has consumed more than 3,700 acres in California\u2019s Butte County since it was reported Tuesday. The blaze, which was 71% contained by Saturday morning, has forced thousands of people to evacuate and prompted about 2,000 firefighters to battle the flames under the extreme heat and extremely dry conditions in the Oroville area. The wildfire has injured 11 firefighters, including eight who were affected by heat-related illnesses, according to Chris Peterson, a spokesperson for the\u00a0California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection\u00a0\u2013 also known as Cal Fire. Twenty-six structures have been destroyed by the blaze and more than 450 are under threat. In Central California, four firefighters have been injured battling the 908-acre French Fire about 55 miles north of Fresno, according to Cal Fire. The blaze is 25% contained. \u201cChallenges are immense. We\u2019re dealing with the increased temperatures, very steep and remote terrain,\u201d Cal Fire deputy director of communications Nick Schuler told CNN, adding \u201cthe ability for rapid growth from the amount of vegetation that\u2019s across the state is a challenge.\u201d The largest current fire in the state is on federal land, with the Basin Fire having consumed more than 14,000 acres. According to officials with Sierra National Forest, the fire is 46% contained and hasn\u2019t grown much in the past day. The state\u2019s been seeing an active fire season, with more than 150,000 acres burned so far in 2024 compared to 8,674 acres burned by this time last year, according to\u00a0Cal Fire. There are now nearly two dozen active wildfires of varying sizes burning across California, and the Thompson Fire is among the largest where\u00a0Cal Fire is the lead agency. California Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a\u00a0state of emergency\u00a0for the area of the Thompson Fire on Wednesday. The declaration cleared the path for additional resources, including the possibility of mobilizing the California National Guard to assist. It will feel like 110 in some areas of the South and mid-Atlantic As the West swelters, hazardous heat persists in the mid-Atlantic and Southeast and humidity will make it feel like up to 110 degrees at times.  Heat advisories are in place from the beaches of Alabama and Florida all the way to upstate New York. \u201cTake extra precautions when outside. Wear lightweight and loose fitting clothing,\u201d the National Weather Service said. \u201cTry to limit strenuous activities to early morning or evening. Take action when you see symptoms of heat exhaustion and heat stroke.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/06/weather/heat-record-temperatures-saturday/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_05_middleeast_pezeshkian-wins-irans-vote-intl-hnk", "text": "Reformist candidate Masoud Pezeshkian has won Iran\u2019s presidential election, the country\u2019s electoral authority said Saturday, defeating his hardline rival in a pivotal vote amid heightened tensions both domestically and internationally. Out of 30.5 million votes counted in Friday\u2019s runoff, Pezeshkian won 53.6%, edging out ultraconservative Saeed Jalili, who had 44.3% of the votes, state-run Press TV reported. Voter turnout was 49.8%, Press TV reported. Pezeshkian was elected in a second round of voting after securing the highest number of ballots in the first round, ahead of Jalili. The first round saw the lowest voter turnout for a presidential election since the Islamic Republic was established in 1979. In a victory speech in Tehran on Saturday, Pezeshkian thanked the Iranian people and vowed to serve as a \u201cvoice of the voiceless.\u201d \u201cI am the servant of the people of Iran. We will serve you, dear people of our country,\u201d Pezeshkian said at the burial site of Imam Khomeini, the leader of Iran\u2019s 1979 Islamic Revolution and the founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran. The 69-year-old trained heart surgeon and lawmaker acknowledged the challenges facing the country as he called for unity in what he described as a new chapter for Iran. \u201cLet\u2019s come together, let\u2019s stick together, let\u2019s get united and work together,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would be able to deal with every aspect and area of the government: economic, financial, military and social challenges.\u201d The country\u2019s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei, thanked the candidates and congratulated the president-elect. Khamenei praised the country for quickly holding \u201cfree and transparent elections\u201d in the wake of President Ebrahim Raisi\u2019s death. A snap election was held after Raisi died in a helicopter crash in May in Iran\u2019s remote northwest, along with Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian and other officials. Khamenei advised Pezeshkian to act \u201cin continuation of the path\u201d of Raisi. The Guardian Council, a powerful 12-member body tasked with overseeing elections and legislation, must certify the vote before Pezeshkian can take office. Pezeshkian will take the helm in a country that is facing increasing international isolation, internal discontent, a spiraling economy and the prospect of direct conflict with its archenemy Israel. The lawmaker was the only reformist candidate vying for the top elected seat in the country after dozens of other candidates were barred from running. He has favored dialogue with Iran\u2019s foes, particularly over its nuclear program, and sees that as a means to address the country\u2019s domestic issues. \u201cThe primary issue is the perspective: Do we want to solve our problems with the world or not? I believe we must get out of the deadlock to solve the country\u2019s problems,\u201d he said at a presidential debate ahead of the second round of voting. The leaders of Russia, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and Syria were among the first to congratulate Pezeshkian. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman said he was \u201ckeen to develop and deepen the relations that bring together our two countries and peoples, and serve our common interests,\u201d according to state-run Saudi Press Agency. Russian President Vladimir Putin said he hoped Pezeshkian\u2019s election would expand bilateral cooperation \u201cin all areas\u201d in the interest of \u201csimplifying regional security and stability,\u201d according to a statement from the Kremlin. The US State Department acknowledged Pezeshkian\u2019s victory, but said the elections \u201cwere not free or fair\u201d and would \u201cnot have a significant impact on our approach to Iran.\u201d \u201cWe have no expectation these elections will lead to fundamental change in Iran\u2019s direction or more respect for the human rights of its citizens,\u201d a spokesperson for the department said. While the Iranian president does enjoy some powers, the ultimate authority lies with the Supreme Leader, who has the final say on all matters of state. Who is Masoud Pezeshkian? A health minister under reformist president Mohammad Khatami, Pezeshkian is a trained heart surgeon and lawmaker. He gained prominence for his stance against the crackdown on the 2009 pro-democracy protests and violence perpetrated by the notorious morality police in 2022 in the wake of Mahsa Amini\u2019s death. Amini died in the custody of the morality police after being detained for not adhering to the Islamic Republic\u2019s strict dress code for women. Hundreds were killed and thousands arrested as the authorities sought to crush the protests, according to the United Nations. During the 2022 protests, Pezeshkian said in an interview with Iran\u2019s IRINN TV: \u201cIt is our fault. We want to implement religious faith through the use of force. This is scientifically impossible.\u201d \u201cI bear part of the blame, the distinguished religious scholars and the mosques bear part of the blame, and the (Iranian) broadcasting authority bears part of the blame,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody should step forward and be held accountable, rather than capture that girl, beat her up, and eventually deliver her body (to her family).\u201d He has presented himself as a candidate for all Iranians. \u201cAmong my supporters are both left and right, even those who do not pray,\u201d he said at a recent presidential debate. After losing his wife and one of his children in a 1994 car crash, he devoted much of his time to politics. Pezeshkian ran for president in the 2013 and 2021 elections, but failed to make headway. The 69-year-old hails from an ethnically mixed family \u2013 his father is Azeri and his mother is Kurdish. Persian isn\u2019t his mother tongue. That has burnished his image for Iran\u2019s minorities but left him open to xenophobic attacks from some opponents. Can he bring change to Iran? Experts say a more moderate face in the presidency could facilitate dialogue between Iran and Western states. Domestically, Pezeshkian may also introduce some social changes, which he emphasized during his electoral campaign, though experts caution that such moves are far from guaranteed. Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa Programme at the Chatham House think tank in London, said it\u2019s unlikely that Pezeshkian\u2019s election would immediately translate into policy changes. \u201cBut Pezeshkian has made it clear that he will try to work through and within the system in order to perhaps accommodate a less repressive environment.\u201d The reformist did not guarantee that he could make those changes, Vakil said, adding that this demonstrates the limits of presidential powers in Iran. \u201cBut it may add a bit more room for maneuver on social freedoms,\u201d she noted. Ra\u2019na Rajabi, an Iranian woman, she was happy that Pezeshkian was elected. \u201cHonestly speaking, I just hope the expensiveness decreases, and jobs are easily found for young people, and that\u2019s it, I do not have any other special feelings,\u201d she said, adding that she hoped \u201cgirls and people can easily walk in the street without being anxious about anyone picking on them.\u201d Other factors may be more difficult to change, particularly Iran\u2019s foreign policy. Pezeshkian assumes the presidency at a time when his country is embroiled in escalating tensions with Israel and its Western allies, triggered by the war in Gaza and the advancement of Iran\u2019s nuclear program. Just three months ago, Iran and Israel exchanged fire for the first time as the Gaza conflict widened. Israel is now preparing for a potential second front against Hezbollah, Iran\u2019s primary regional proxy, in Lebanon. Rhetoric between Iran and Israel escalated last week as Iran\u2019s mission to the United Nations said that should Israel \u201cembark on full-scale military aggression\u201d against Lebanon, then \u201can obliterating war will ensue.\u201d \u201cAll options, including the full involvement of all Resistance Fronts, are on the table,\u201d it said on X. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz responded that \u201ca regime that threatens destruction deserves to be destroyed.\u201d Pezeshkian is not expected to change the current trajectory on Israel, experts said. He has also praised General Qasem Soleimani, the controversial head of the Iran Revolutionary Guard Corps\u2019 Quds Force, who was assassinated in a US strike in 2020. \u201cI consider him a source of national pride and a thorn in the eyes of our enemies,\u201d he said in a recent presidential debate. A friendlier face to the West But while Western states aren\u2019t expecting this election to change their relationship with Iran, Pezeshkian is certainly their preferred candidate, as his opponent would have only escalated those existing tensions, experts said. Former Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, a key ally of Pezeshkian and a reformist who oversaw a comparatively warm period of international relations nearly a decade ago, has been mooted as a potential candidate to reoccupy his old post under the new president. Zarif was Iran\u2019s top diplomat when the regime struck a deal with the US and world powers to limit Tehran\u2019s nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief (a deal that has since all but collapsed). While he is popular among Iranian youth, he has also faced criticism from hardliners at home for being too friendly to the West. \u201cWith Mr. Pezeshkian, the sanctions will likely be lifted, and that\u2019s very good for people,\u201d Hossein Imani, a Tehran resident, said. \u201cI have a positive feeling (about Pezeshkian) for now, with the condition that he fulfils the promises he has made.\u201d Ahead of the elections, however, Supreme Leader Khamenei condemned those seeking improved relations with the West. And Pezeshkian has publicly stated that he would defer to Khamenei on matters of foreign policy, so Zarif\u2019s appointment is far from assured.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/middleeast/pezeshkian-wins-irans-vote-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "travel_stranger-invite-vacation-italy-chance-encounter", "text": "Carter Leathers was sitting at a table on the terrace of a boutique hotel in the center of Florence, Italy \u2013 sipping a Negroni and trying to quieten her nerves. The courtyard was peaceful, open and airy, dotted with aperitivo-hour drinkers. Carter tried to soak up the Florentine vibes \u2013 and avoid checking her phone and reading the inevitable anxious messages from her mother. Then through the stone arches into the courtyard, walked a tall, confident-looking guy in a blue suit. This must be Max Ratzenb\u00f6ck, thought Carter. The man was looking around the courtyard, and then his eyes met Carter\u2019s. He started smiling, looking instantly pleased to see her. This feeling was mutual. Carter smiled back. \u201cWow, he looks good,\u201d Carter thought to herself. Carter and Max said their hellos. And soon Max was sitting opposite Carter, his own Negroni in hand. \u201cOnce we started talking, we just kept smiling at each other,\u201d Carter tells CNN Travel today. \u201cWe just hit it off.\u201d The decision to meet up in Florence no longer felt quite so crazy. \u201cOkay, yeah. This is going to work,\u201d Carter recalls thinking. An \u2018Eat, Pray, Love\u2019 trip It was late August 2022. Carter, a 35-year-old esthetician from Sacramento, California, was on what she calls an \u201cEat, Pray, Love-style\u201d vacation in Europe. Earlier that summer, Carter had dated a guy in California and she\u2019d hoped their relationship might go somewhere. Instead, it unceremoniously ended. In the wake of that disappointment, Carter made a conscious choice to shift her priorities. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m just going to go do my own thing. I\u2019m not waiting for anybody,\u2019\u201d she thought. With that mindset, Carter booked a solo trip to Europe. \u201cI said, \u2018I\u2019m just going to go and explore and kind of see what happens, and see who I meet,\u2019\u201d recalls Carter. Carter was excited for a change of scene, a change of pace. She loves art and imagined herself whiling away afternoons in galleries in picturesque European cities \u2013 without having to accommodate a partner\u2019s needs or requirements. While putting together her itinerary, Carter knew Florence and Rome were non-negotiable stop-offs. But she wasn\u2019t sure about her third destination. She weighed up options and in the end, she got inspiration from an unlikely place: an episode of reality television show \u201cThe Bachelor,\u201d filmed in Vienna, Austria. The episode included sweeping shots of the historic buildings and green parks. \u201cThe city looked so pretty,\u201d recalls Carter. Flights booked and hotel reservations made, Carter decided to switch her dating app location settings to Vienna. Carter\u2019s app of choice was Bumble, which prompts women to make the first move in hetrosexual pairings. \u201cI was like, \u2018Okay, let\u2019s see what the guys look like in Vienna,\u2019\u201d Carter recalls. And that\u2019s when Carter saw Max Ratzenb\u00f6ck for the first time. \u201cAs I started swiping, he was the second guy that came up and I was just like, \u2018Oh, my gosh, I hope we match,\u2019\u201d Carter recalls. A couple of hours later, Carter\u2019s phone pinged: Max from Vienna had liked her back. It was a match. A dating app match In the summer of 2022 Max was a 31-year-old Austrian comedian finding his footing in his personal life and career in the wake of the pandemic. \u201cI\u2019d just moved into the apartment I\u2019d always wanted to have \u2013 it was in the middle of Vienna, it\u2019s an old apartment, a bit of a bachelor pad,\u201d Max tells CNN Travel today. \u201cI was acting and I\u2019m a comedian. But since Covid, I left the stage, basically, because at that time, the stage was not really an option.\u201d Like many comedians in the wake of the pandemic, Max turned to TikTok. He found some success posting comedic videos there, and became focused on growing his social media audience, while also juggling his day job at an advertising agency. \u201cBasically that\u2019s what all I was doing \u2013 meeting with friends and working \u2013 and then I took a chance on Bumble too,\u201d says Max. Max vividly remembers the moment he opened the dating app and saw Carter for the first time. \u201cThere\u2019s this gorgeous-looking lady on my front page,\u201d he recalls. Max was so struck by Carter, he remembers questioning if she was \u201ceven real.\u201d \u201cI would get that question a lot, if I was real,\u201d says Carter today. \u201cThey\u2019d be like, \u2018Oh this is a fake profile.\u2019\u201d Max swiped to the right \u201cimmediately.\u201d Then he got the notification: Carter liked him too, it was a match. Max couldn\u2019t believe it. \u201cThat turned out to be a very good decision,\u201d says Max, of his decision to swipe right on Carter\u2019s profile. \u201cThe best I ever made.\u201d Max and Carter started messaging back and forth right away, with Carter explaining to Max she was based in the US, but would be visiting Europe in a few weeks time. Their messages were light, flirty, and friendly. Carter suggested Max could maybe show her around Vienna. \u201cI was totally, totally doing that,\u201d says Max. \u201cI blocked all my stuff out of my calendar to have four to five days to show Carter around Vienna.\u201d A spontaneous decision Carter and Max exchanged regular messages in the lead up to her arrival in Europe. Then, when Carter got to Italy, she and Max switched from chatting on Bumble to using messaging app WhatsApp. And now they were in the same time zone, their back and forth became even more frequent. \u201cWhen I was in Rome, I started texting him more and more,\u201d recalls Carter. \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh, he seems like a nice guy.\u2019 But you never know who you\u2019re talking to.\u201d Carter was excited, but also a little wary about the idea of meeting up with a total stranger in a foreign country. \u201cIf I\u2019m going to meet up with this guy, I should FaceTime him to make sure he\u2019s real,\u201d she thought. So one evening, while she was relaxing on the balcony of her Rome hotel room, Carter spontaneously hit the call button on her cell phone. Some 700 miles away in Vienna, Max was sitting at home, playing video games online with friends. \u201cIt was a Saturday night. It was summer, it was really hot,\u201d recalls Max. \u201cI think I\u2019d played basketball, had a nice shower, and now there was a nice summer breeze coming in. And then she called me for the first time.\u201d Max saw Carter\u2019s name pop up on his phone and immediately dropped the video game controller. \u201cI told my friends to get off \u2013 \u2018I\u2019m not here for the next two or three games,\u2019\u201d recalls Max. \u201cAnd then we had our first talk face to face. She was on her balcony having a glass of red wine in Rome.\u201d Carter thought it was \u201cendearing\u201d that, rather than being out partying on a Saturday night, Max was home playing video games. She felt it boded well for their potential connection. \u201cI\u2019m more of a homebody too,\u201d explains Carter. And even though she\u2019d called him out of the blue, Max looked thrilled to speak with her. The video chat quashed any worries Carter had about meeting Max in person. \u201cIt just felt really easy talking to him,\u201d she says. \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh, this is nice. I like this guy.\u2019\u201d During the FaceTime call, Carter mentioned she was going to be going to Florence next. Max then spoke a bit about his memories of Florence \u2013 it was a city he\u2019d visited multiple times, as he\u2019d spent regular family vacations in Tuscany growing up. As Max described his fondness for Florence, a thought crossed Carter\u2019s mind. \u201cI\u2019m just gonna be wandering around the city by myself,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you actually want to come meet me in Florence?\u201d Carter pretty much assumed Max would say no \u2013 she figured he\u2019d be busy, unable to make it work, unwillingly to spontaneously travel to Italy. But to her surprise, Max just smiled and said yes immediately. \u201cI couldn\u2019t wait,\u201d recalls Max. \u201cI was completely stoked to meet her. We\u2019d been talking for a couple of weeks and it intensified over time. So I got that flight to Florence.\u201d An Italian rendez-vous That\u2019s how Carter came to be waiting for Max in the hotel courtyard on August 31, 2022 sipping her Negroni. \u201cI was thinking, \u2018This is either going to go really good or really bad,\u2019\u201d Carter recalls. \u201cI was trying not to be nervous.\u201d Max was nervous too. When he told a close friend about his plans, his friend was pretty blunt. \u201cOh, wow,\u201d the friend said. \u201cEither this is going to become the biggest romance of all time, or it\u2019s going to be the worst holiday of your life.\u201d \u201cYeah, you\u2019re probably right,\u201d said Max. Carter\u2019s mother, meanwhile, was \u201cso worried.\u201d In a series of frantic texts, she told Carter to hide her passport, and send updates as soon as she\u2019d met Max in person. Despite the nerves \u2013 and their loved ones\u2019 apprehension \u2013 as soon as Carter and Max met in person on the Florence hotel terrace, they both felt certain they\u2019d made the right decision. They spent the rest of the evening chatting, flirting and laughing over cocktails. This evening set the tone for the rest of the four days, in which they were together pretty much 24/7. \u201cWe just hit it off so well that I was like, \u2018Just stay with me. I want you to stay with me,\u2019\u201d recalls Carter. \u201cAnd so he ended up staying with me in my hotel the rest of the time in Florence. Pretty much from the moment we met, we were together.\u201d In Florence, Carter and Max spent the days sightseeing around the city and evenings ducking into osterias to share bottles of wine and bowls of pasta. They took photos together \u2013 including their first-ever picture, posing on Florence\u2019s Ponte Vecchio bridge \u2013 something that should have been awkward, but they both wanted to capture the moment. Carter texted the pictures to her mother and sister. \u201cWow, you look great together,\u201d they replied. Max also sent the Ponte Vecchio photo to his mother. \u201cI told her right away,\u201d recalls Max. \u201cI said: \u2018Wow, look at that picture, isn\u2019t she beautiful? We hit it off and it\u2019s going great.\u2019\u201d When their time in Florence came to an end, Carter and Max traveled on to Vienna, together. \u201cIt was three, four days in Florence,\u201d recalls Carter. \u201cAnd then another four days in Vienna,\u201d adds Max. \u201cSo our first date lasted a week,\u201d says Carter, laughing. Falling in love in Vienna After the amazing time in Florence, Max was excited to show Carter around Vienna, the city he called home. \u201cI was pretty eager to give her the cr\u00e8me-de-la-cr\u00e8me tour,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m a very proud Austrian. I\u2019m very happy with this capital city. We have this very beautiful city.\u201d Unlike Florence and Rome, Vienna is \u201cnever really on the list of places for Americans who do Europe,\u201d says Max. \u201cThat\u2019s so weird to me,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause it\u2019s the center of culture. And it\u2019s gorgeous.\u201d Max was determined Carter would fall in love with Vienna \u2013 especially given they were falling for one another too. The first evening was spent at Vienna\u2019s historic opera house watching Puccini\u2019s romantic opera \u201cLa Boh\u00e8me.\u201d Max and Carter sat hand-in-hand in the theater, drank red wine in intermission and afterward Max introduced Carter to a Viennese tradition. \u201cThere\u2019s a very famous sausage stand, right next to the Opera House, where you would meet the president after the opera \u2013 because everybody goes there to get a sausage and a piece of bread with mustard, and eat it and have a last sip of beer before they go home after the opera,\u201d says Max. The two also toured the city\u2019s numerous palaces, visited the Sch\u00f6nbrunn Zoo and rode the historic Ferris wheel. For Carter and Max, the time in Vienna was both a whirlwind romantic haze and defined by a feeling of easy, surprising intimacy. \u201cI was really comfortable. When we were in Vienna, he was already ironing my clothes for me,\u201d says Carter. \u201cIt went from zero to 100, really, really quick, in terms of comfort. \u201cHe just took such good care of me and that\u2019s what really impressed me. He watched out for me, he showed me around\u2026\u201d Then, all of a sudden, the week was up and Carter had to fly back to California. Max took Carter to the airport and as they said their goodbyes in the departures area, he was firm that the farewell wasn\u2019t forever: \u201cI\u2019m going to come and see you in California,\u201d he promised. As they hugged goodbye, a feeling of certainty crossed Carter\u2019s mind. \u201cThis is it,\u201d she thought. \u201cAnd either I\u2019m going to have to move here, or he\u2019s going to have to move to America.\u201d Carter boarded her flight, and Max went home alone. Back in his apartment, Max called his mother to fill her in properly on his romantic adventure, enthusing about Carter and their time together. \u201cAnd then I put my phone away and I was sitting there, I was like \u2018Oh, this is weird,\u2019\u201d he says. Max suddenly felt lonely and sad \u2013 and simultaneously, he found himself marveling at that feeling. \u201cYou met this person only a week before \u2013 three and a half weeks before online \u2013 and now she\u2019s not here and it\u2019s horrible,\u201d he thought. Max\u2019s life in Vienna felt empty without Carter. And over the next few weeks, as he wandered around the city, Max realized every corner of the city reminded him of her \u2013 whether he was walking past the sausage stand outside the Opera House, or just spotting the Ferris wheel turning in the city skyline. Back in Sacramento, Carter kept having to remind herself that her visit to Europe wasn\u2019t a dream. It felt like a \u201cfairy tale,\u201d she says. And it was hard to wrap her head around everything that had happened in such a short space of time. As soon as he could, Max booked a flight to visit Carter for later in the fall. Eventually, this visit rolled around. \u201cI went and picked him up from the airport. And I was like, \u2018I cannot believe he\u2019s here. I can\u2019t believe it. Oh my gosh, this is real. He really came. He\u2019s really here,\u2019\u201d recalls Carter. A California visit Carter wanted to introduce Max to the best of California in the same way he\u2019d shown her Vienna. So first they stopped off in San Francisco, then the two went to Napa Valley and spent a few days in the wine country. \u201cI took him wine tasting and showed him all over there,\u201d recalls Carter. \u201cIt was really fun.\u201d Carter also introduced Max to her whole family and they all traveled together to the coastal city of Monterey for a few days\u2019 vacation. \u201cIt was great. We just threw him into the fire,\u201d says Carter. \u201cWe had a lot of fun,\u201d says Max. \u201cMonterey is a little nice town on the coast on the way south \u2013 I totally fell in love with that place too.\u201d When Max and Carter said goodbye at the end of Max\u2019s trip, they promised to meet again as soon as they could. And so Carter booked a trip to Vienna for December, which happened to coincide with her birthday. Carter assumed they\u2019d stay in Vienna, wander around the Christmas markets \u2013 but Max had a surprise up his sleeve: \u201cHe said, \u2018We\u2019re going to Paris for your birthday,\u2019\u201d recalls Carter. She couldn\u2019t believe it. \u201cI had always wanted to see Paris,\u201d says Carter. After the Parisian getaway, Carter returned to the US for Christmas. Max joined her, and the two welcomed the New Year together, excited for all 2023 might bring. But while Carter and Max were certain they wanted to be together, the shape of their future was still uncertain. They\u2019d both spent way more money on international flights in 2022 than they\u2019d ever anticipated. It just wasn\u2019t sustainable to travel back and forth so regularly. So Max and Carter waited it out for a few months, and while the nine-hour time difference was difficult to navigate, the couple remained committed to one another from across the Atlantic. Making a decision After a few months apart, in spring 2023 Carter returned to Austria, joining Max on a family vacation to the south of the country. \u201cThat was the first time she met my dad and my brother and his girlfriend and my mom,\u201d says Max. The trip was a bit of a baptism of fire, Max admits. \u201cWe went on this unbelievably long biking trip,\u201d he recalls. \u201cShe did so well, I couldn\u2019t believe it, because it was, like, 55 kilometers \u2013 you know, really long \u2013 electric vehicles, up and down the hills \u2013 but with several wine breaks, so that made it a bit easier.\u201d It was during this trip that Carter and Max started talking more seriously about the future, and what it might look like. \u201cI want you here with me,\u201d Max told Carter. \u201cI want you here with me more than anything.\u201d But when the topic of marriage came up, Carter was surprised to realize they were on slightly different pages. All her friends in the US in committed relationships were married. But Max had friends in Austria who\u2019d been with their partners for over a decade and shared several kids, but had no intention of ever signing marriage papers. To Carter, this seemed to be something of a cultural gap \u2013 maybe there was a stronger commitment to the institution of marriage in the US than in Austria? Max even said he never planned to get married. But when Carter explained that marriage was important to her, a crucial symbol of commitment in a relationship, Max understood. He wanted to be with Carter forever, that much was sure. And so Max and Carter confirmed marriage was in their future. Also in their future? Carter leaving California and permanently moving to Vienna. This was a big decision, but Carter had fallen in love with the Austrian capital, and was excited at the idea of a life there. The couple did also consider Max moving to the US, but in the end, Vienna won out. \u201cIt\u2019s always ranked the most livable city in the world,\u201d Carter says, referring to the recent Economist Intelligence Unit list of the world\u2019s most livable cities, which ranked Vienna at number one for the third year in a row.\u00a0\u201cWe just felt quality of life would be a lot better here in Vienna.\u201d As for Max, he suggests moving to the US at some point isn\u2019t off the table. \u201cI\u2019ve always had a very big affiliation with America,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd why should I not take the same thing on my back that Carter did for me, and move over to America? We\u2019ll see. But I think that Vienna is just the perfect place to live, all in all.\u201d In May 2023, Carter moved out of her Sacramento apartment, sold her car and all her furniture, packed a couple of suitcases, and moved across the world to start a new life. Sadly, just as Carter set off for the airport, Max\u2019s grandmother unexpectedly passed away. Carter arrived in Vienna to a grieving Max and a few days later, accompanied him to the funeral. It was a \u201crough start,\u201d admits Max. But he was so pleased to see Carter. For both Max and Carter, being by each other\u2019s side during this tough period reinforced their certainty that they\u2019d made the right decision. \u201cYou want to have your better half at your side when life gets a bit hard,\u201d says Max. \u201cAnd my grandma was really important to me, so I appreciated Carter being there.\u201d Carter didn\u2019t bring much with her to Europe \u2013 she\u2019d sold basically everything, after all. But there was one non-negotiable: her dog, Waffles. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to come without her,\u201d says Carter. Max was almost as excited about Waffles moving in as he was finally living with Carter. \u201cI never had a dog, ever,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I always wanted one. She\u2019s awesome.\u201d Adjusting to life in Vienna was a big change \u2013 for both Waffles and Carter \u2013 but Carter felt supported by Max as she began to accilimatize to Austria. \u201cHe made it very easy for me to come over and start my life here,\u201d she says. A wedding and an anniversary In late August 2023, on the one year anniversary of their first meeting, Carter and Max got married in Austria, in a small city hall wedding attended by immediate family. Carter took Max\u2019s name, becoming Carter Ratzenb\u00f6ck. \u201cWe had a little brunch with our eight guests,\u201d says Max. \u201cAnd then we took off to go right back to Florence.\u201d In Florence, Max and Carter retraced the steps of their first trip together. The couple recreated their first ever photo together \u2013 taken a year previously, on Florence\u2019s Ponte Vecchio Bridge. And as a nod to that first date, Carter dug out the sparkly headband she\u2019d worn that day, which serendipitously coordinated with her white wedding dress. The couple also took photos in the Uffizi Gallery, kissing in front of Botticelli\u2019s \u201cThe Birth of Venus.\u201d And as they walked around Florence, passersby, spotting that they were newlyweds, started cheering and clapping. Today Max and Carter are fast approaching their first wedding anniversary \u2013 and the two year anniversary of their first meeting. They plan to return to Florence once again to celebrate both occasions. \u201cWe\u2019re kind of making it a thing,\u201d says Carter. \u201cThis will be year three in Florence.\u201d For Carter and Max it\u2019s surreal to think how much their lives have changed since their first meeting just two years ago. Today, Carter admits it was \u201ckind of crazy\u201d to arrange a date with a guy who lived on the other side of the world. And Max appreciates it was \u201cpretty crazy\u201d to fly to Florence to see a woman he met on the internet. The couple are grateful everything worked out \u2013 and appreciate their happy ending was perhaps against the odds. But Carter\u2019s also grateful for their mutual optimistic outlook, which defined their early decisions and still defines their relationship today. \u201cBe optimistic,\u201d she says. \u201cTake a chance \u2013 that\u2019s what I was thinking at the time.\u201d After all, Carter says, if she hadn\u2019t been optimistic about travel, about love, about Max \u2013 her life today would look very different. Carter and Max suggest their story also disproves the notion that falling in love via a dating app is less romantic than stumbling across a stranger the old-fashioned way. \u201cThank goodness for dating apps,\u201d says Carter. \u201cIt allowed us to reach each other. Because I would never have met him otherwise. There\u2019s no way we would have ever ran into each other. Because like we said, he likes to stay in and play video games\u2026 And how cool is it that you get to meet somebody through this app, on the other side of the world and see what those people are like? I just think online dating opens up so many more possibilities.\u201d \u201cI think our story is the perfect example that the impossible is out there,\u201d adds Max. \u201cAll those parts\u2026 with meeting online, one in the heart of Europe, one on the west coast in America, one completely involved in his life and one in her life traveling\u2026 All those puzzle pieces are perfect for a novel, but not for real life, at least that\u2019s what most people think. But that\u2019s not true. We are the best example. And we\u2019re very happy that it happened that way.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/stranger-invite-vacation-italy-chance-encounter/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_23_europe_keir-starmer-labour-prime-minister-profile-intl-cmd", "text": "Four-and-a-half years ago, Britain\u2019s Labour Party suffered its worst election defeat since 1935. The historic election victory of Boris Johnson in 2019 \u2013 which allowed him to finally implement Brexit \u2013 was supposed to mark another 10 years of Conservative rule in Britain, with Labour resigned to rebuild on the fringes of politics. Then Labour leader, the hard-left Jeremy Corbyn, was forced to resign and reluctantly hand his party to the centrist Keir Starmer, a former lawyer, knight of the realm and exactly the type of establishment figure that Corbyn and the far-left despise. In little over four years, Starmer has pulled off a once-impossible coup and dragged his Labour Party from the margins of British politics to a thumping victory in Thursday\u2019s general election. It will be the first time Labour has been in power since 2010 and the first time it has entered power from opposition since Tony Blair\u2019s historic win in 1997. Addressing the nation before entering 10 Downing Street Friday afternoon, Starmer pledged a return to the politics of public service, vowing to heal the \u201cweariness at the heart of the nation\u201d with \u201caction not words.\u201d It was clear going into this election campaign that Britain was screaming out for change after 14 years of Conservative rule that saw cuts in public spending, stretched public services, the chaos of Brexit, a cost-of-living crisis and a sitting prime minister fined by police while in office for the first time in history. Starmer, who had led the opinion polls since October 2021, has promised to be the agent of change that Britain wants. During the campaign, he pledged to grow the\u00a0country\u2019s\u00a0economy by reforming planning laws and investing in a new industrial strategy. He\u00a0said he\u00a0will set up a national wealth fund with \u00a37.3 billion\u00a0($9.3bn)\u00a0of public money that will help pay for the\u00a0transition to net zero\u00a0emissions. An\u00a0\u00a38.3 billion ($10.5 billion) publicly owned energy company, Great British Energy, will see the\u00a0United Kingdom\u2019s energy grid\u00a0decarbonized\u00a0by 2030. Starmer says all this can be achieved without raising income taxes, though there are no commitments\u00a0on other levies, such as capital gains tax, which is paid on money made from selling assets, including property and shares. The rest of the\u00a0Labour\u00a0manifesto comprised a mix of modest centrism with soft socialism.\u00a0It included imposing\u00a0taxes on private schools to\u00a0help\u00a0pay for state education\u00a0and windfall\u00a0levies\u00a0on energy companies to fund the transition to clean energy. There were\u00a0also\u00a0commitments on workers\u2019 rights, cutting waiting lists for health care\u00a0and\u00a0also controlling immigration. Critics on the right say that Starmer will need to raise taxes to fund his plans, while\u00a0skeptics\u00a0on the left say his manifesto is not bold or ambitious enough to change Britain for the better. In short,\u00a0this is\u00a0a long list of things to sort out in a five-year term when public finances are in disarray. The question for Starmer\u00a0now\u00a0is whether the mess is too big for him to fix and whether he has the political skill to bring about the change he promised. Who is Keir Starmer? On paper,\u00a0the 61-year-old\u00a0Starmer looks like a classic establishment figure. Once a leading human rights lawyer, he became Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) in 2008, running the Crown Prosecution Service of England and Wales \u2013\u00a0a high-profile job for which he was knighted, making him the first ever Labour leader to enter the job with the prefix Sir to their name. Starmer, however, is - by the standards of modern political leaders - from relatively humble beginnings. Born in 1962, Starmer grew up in a small town to the south of London. His father was a toolmaker who worked in a factory, his mother was a nurse who suffered with severe physical disabilities, which ultimately led to one of her legs being amputated. While Starmer has never claimed to have suffered poverty, he has talked of financial struggles that affected his family, as well as the learning difficulties that held back his younger brother. Clearly, these early experiences shaped Starmer\u2019s politics. He has talked about noticing people looking down on his father for working in a factory or bullying his brother. His parents were political, naming their\u00a0eldest after the first Labour leader in parliament, Keir Hardie. \u201cHe\u2019s the first Labour leader in a generation to talk about class and snobbery,\u201d\u00a0Tom Baldwin, author of \u201cKeir Starmer: The Biography,\u201d\u00a0told CNN.\u00a0\u201cThis doesn\u2019t make him a class warrior but someone who understands the different layers of pride, aspiration and guilt\u2026 He feels the sting of the disrespect his dad experienced\u2026 He talks a lot about his sister who has led a precarious life as a carer, having not gone to university.\u201d Starmer chose to study law at the University of Leeds, before completing a postgraduate\u00a0degree\u00a0at the University of Oxford. He initially thought he would have a legal career working for trade unions, but as his politics evolved in line with his studies, he became increasingly interested in human rights. What does he believe? Starmer has been on something of a journey since entering politics. He was elected to Parliament in 2015 at the age of 52 and\u00a0entered\u00a0the shadow cabinet\u00a0a\u00a0little over a year later. Corbyn,\u00a0then the Labour leader, made Starmer his Brexit chief following the 2016 referendum. Corbyn is a controversial figure in British politics and serving in his top team is still something that haunts Starmer. Corbyn had historically been\u00a0on\u00a0the far left of the Labour Party. Prior to becoming leader in 2015, Corbyn had at various points in his long career supported nuclear disarmament,\u00a0and\u00a0withdrawal from NATO, and said it was a \u201ctragedy\u201d that Osama bin Laden was killed rather than put on trial. Starmer was in Corbyn\u2019s shadow cabinet\u00a0for\u00a0the 2017 and 2019 general elections \u2013 something the Conservatives bring up regularly as evidence that he is a threat to national security, having tried twice to make Corbyn prime minister. However, Starmer has since kicked Corbyn out of\u00a0the\u00a0Labour Party following an investigation into\u00a0antisemitism\u00a0during Corbyn\u2019s time as leader. Starmer\u00a0has also said\u00a0that he supported Corbyn knowing he would lose. Pressed on that point in a BBC \u201cQuestion Time\u201d program, he said Corbyn \u201cwould be a better prime minister\u201d than \u201cwhat we got\u201d in\u00a0Boris Johnson. Starmer also argues\u00a0that he\u00a0has brought Labour back to a position of electability. This result proves that he was right, but critics of Starmer on the left say that he used Corbyn and\u00a0his wing\u00a0of the Labour Party to win the party leadership in 2020 \u2013 committing to\u00a0several\u00a0left-wing positions\u00a0such as\u00a0nationalizing public services, scrapping university tuition fees and reversing\u00a0Conservative welfare reforms \u2013 only to abandon those pledges\u00a0once he got closer to\u00a0power. James Schneider, Corbyn\u2019s former communications chief, told CNN: \u201cStarmer is not a principled man. His campaign to become Labour leader was systemically dishonest. His cynicism and lack of policies to improve people\u2019s lives will lead to a deep disillusionment that could either feed the hard right or a future people\u2019s movement for change.\u201d Starmer has at various times responded to accusations that he has drifted politically by saying that he puts his country before his political party, and that it\u2019s only possible to change things if you are in power. Can Starmer change Britain? Whether you think Starmer\u2019s\u00a0current\u00a0plan is unambitious, dishonest, or exactly what Britain needs, it\u2019s impossible to push through policy without political and personal capital. Dominic Grieve, a Conservative politician who served as\u00a0attorney\u00a0general while Starmer was DPP, speaks glowingly of this period. \u201cHe ran his department very efficiently and effectively at a really difficult time because his budget had been cut. It was genuinely very impressive,\u201d\u00a0Grieve told CNN. Grieve\u00a0added\u00a0that Starmer was able to be an effective manager because \u201che is not bogged down with years of political ideology or baggage. He can see what is wrong and can address it.\u201d Much as Starmer\u2019s allies might see this as a strength, his opponents, from both sides of politics,\u00a0see it as a weakness. To those on the right, Starmer is a man who would say anything to get in power. He is someone who\u00a0supported\u00a0Corbyn \u2013\u00a0who is anti-NATO and has repeatedly been accused of being a terrorist\u00a0sympathizer \u2013\u00a0to get what he wants and is a danger to Britain. To the left, he is someone who doesn\u2019t have the conviction\u00a0to make radical changes\u00a0and, once in office,\u00a0will not be materially that different to a Conservative leader. Starmer\u00a0is now set to have\u00a0an\u00a0enormous majority in the\u00a0House of Commons. But\u00a0the future may not be so simple.\u00a0Given\u00a0the current state of Britain\u2019s finances, the circumstances of\u00a0Labour\u2019s\u00a0victory and, even Starmer\u2019s own personality traits, it might mean he doesn\u2019t have quite the blank check\u00a0that a leader with virtually no opposition\u00a0in parliament\u00a0would typically enjoy. An\u00a0inability to turn that parliamentary power into tangible results\u00a0at a time when voters are crying out for something different\u00a0could mean that five years from now, his moderate, safety-first center-left program may ultimately be\u00a0seen as\u00a0just as big a political gamble as any of those the Conservatives took in the\u00a0past 14 years.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/23/europe/keir-starmer-labour-prime-minister-profile-intl-cmd/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "travel_uk-tourism-drop-visitor-numbers-election", "text": "It\u2019s hardly a great tourism slogan. \u201cBritain is grinding to a halt\u201d was the verdict of the UK\u2019s Labour Party on the country they hoped to govern, as they were setting out their case for election in June. On July 4, they won by a landslide, promising change. As residents wonder what to expect day-to-day, those abroad might wonder what it means for their travel plans. Because one industry that could do with a change is tourism. Since time immemorial, visitors have flocked to the UK. Its heritage and cultural sites have traditionally made it one of the jewels in Europe\u2019s crown. Yet while visitor numbers are up across the board on the continent \u2013 nearly all EU member states saw numbers rise in 2023 year-on-year \u2013 the UK has not yet caught up with pre-pandemic numbers. Nearly 41 million overseas residents visited the UK in 2019. In 2023, 37.68 million entered \u2013 a drop of 7.3%. Compare that with Italy, which set a new record for arrivals numbers in 2023. Only Luxembourg saw a drop of 0.1% fewer tourists. What\u2019s more, international visitors applying for a tourist visa were down by 19% on pre-pandemic numbers. The slow recovery coincides with tourism-allied hiccups. Regular strikes have been hampering transport. \u201cRail cancelations are at record levels,\u201d according to the new government in its pre-election manifesto. The UK has a glorious coastline, but in recent years many beaches are increasingly polluted by sewage. Tax-free shopping for tourists has been axed, and EU visitors now need a passport to visit, which most don\u2019t have. And in 2024, the rhetoric around safety in the capital has been ramped up. In February, then prime minister Rishi Sunak suggested the country was descending into \u201cmob rule.\u201d He also flagged a 20% rise in knife crime in London in May. His comments were political, made while campaigning for local elections. Yet few listening from abroad would have noted the context. So what\u2019s gone wrong for the UK \u2013 and can the incoming government turn it around? Labour\u2019s pre-election manifesto, in which the party outlined its plans for the country, pretty much ignored the tourism industry. But it didn\u2019t mince its words when describing the problems. \u201cBritain is grinding to a halt,\u201d it said. \u201cRail cancelations are at record levels\u2026 Conservative chaos has seen major projects abandoned, decades-long delays\u2026 and our infrastructure crumbling.\u201d The party has promised to \u201cmodernize\u201d UK transport infrastructure, \u201crebuilding Britain.\u201d The railways will be brought under public ownership. Those traveling by car will be pleased to know that Labour also pledged to repair potholes. However none of this will be quick. Labour\u2019s infrastructure overhaul is based on a 10-year plan. Shifting priorities Is the UK really doing that badly or have travel trends shifted, post-pandemic? For Tom Jenkins, CEO of the European Tourism Organisation, it\u2019s the latter. \u201cI think the UK is doing perfectly well but we\u2019ll see more people going to [continental] Europe,\u201d he says of 2024, adding that there\u2019s \u201callegedly a slight plateau of American demand for the UK.\u201d Patricia Yates, CEO of VisitBritain, disagrees, saying that American visitors have \u201cdriven our recovery since the pandemic.\u201d Kayla Zeigner, owner of travel agency Destination Europe, says she is booking ever-more trips to the UK. But for Marcy Zyonse, owner of Live The Dream Travel, a luxury vacations company, the UK has been hit by changing post-pandemic travel trends. \u201cThe appetite for epic, culturally immersive travel has been so strong in the past couple of years,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople were starved for that. In the US, we didn\u2019t go beyond the Caribbean for a couple of years, so people are looking to do that Greece or Italy trip. We\u2019ve missed out on two or three years of travel, and I think the UK is too low down on the list.\u201d English-speakers want a more exotic experience, she says \u2013 starting with a foreign language. After all, the UK is known for history, culture and the royals \u2013 all of which will be around next year. It\u2019s easier to prioritize that for a much-needed Mediterranean break. And that heritage has also meant the outgoing government has let the tourism industry slide, says Yates. \u201cThere\u2019s a view that we have enormous strength in our culture and heritage, and people will just come,\u201d she says. \u201cThat isn\u2019t the case. Like every export industry, we have to pitch \u2013 to tell people why they should come now. The balance of being a history and heritage destination is that it was there 10 years ago and will be there in 10 years.\u201d There\u2019s also a hangover from the pandemic, when UK travel rules were particularly chaotic, say experts. Destinations that opened early got visitors raving about their first post-lockdown trips \u2013 which had a knock-on effect. \u201cCurrent hotspots are destinations that opened early in 2021 to American tourists, which created a huge surge in demand,\u201d says Zeigler. Zyonse agrees. \u201cYou guys in the UK were behind, and people lost confidence. People booking in 2021 for 2022 didn\u2019t book the UK, and the effect snowballed. Social media has driven people to those places [that opened up earlier].\u201d Making Britain \u2018great\u2019 again So what\u2019s to be done? For Yates, the new government could use tourism as an economy-booster \u2013 to the tune of 7% growth every year, she says, according to VisitBritain\u2019s projections. \u201cThe strength of tourism is that you can dial up quickly \u2013 we don\u2019t need to build lots of infrastructure,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a case of promoting the right places at the right time to the right customers.\u201d Promotion is tricky in itself. The outgoing Conservative government was infamous for its \u201causterity\u201d cuts to public spending. In evidence to parliament in March 2024, VisitBritain revealed that its marketing budget was around \u201c\u00a318 million ($23 million) annually, compared to over 80 euros million ($85.5 million) for Ireland.\u201d Back in November 2021, Yates told CNN that VisitBritain didn\u2019t know what its budget would be from March 2022. Today, she explains, it has a \u00a319.8 million core budget, and gets around the same amount from another government campaign. That\u2019s still around half of Ireland\u2019s budget \u2013 so private-sector funding is used to boost it. \u201cWe know that for every \u00a31 invested we get \u00a315 spent by tourists \u2013 a slice goes to the treasury, and money goes directly from international visitors into the economy. It\u2019s a win-win,\u201d she says. But she\u2019s keen for the new government to help take things further. \u201cTourism delivers over three million jobs, around 10% of the economy,\u201d she says. \u201cTo have a real growth plan, we have to make a statement about Britain overseas that will drive visitors and investment.\u201d Welcoming visitors Not many tourists will have cared about political instability \u2013 as Zeigler says, \u201cAmericans are dealing with our own political chaos.\u201d But Yates says that what does cut through is \u201cthe message of welcome.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s hugely important as a driver for international visitors,\u201d she says. \u201cSometimes Britain has done that well, like during the London Olympics. Sometimes we don\u2019t score as well. We need to look at how we position Britain as a welcoming destination, and how we look at borders and visas.\u201d In the 2023 Anholt-Ipsos Nation Brands Index, which ranks 60 nations on a range of attributes, the UK received its lowest ever rating for \u201cWelcome.\u201d Its rankings for \u201cCulture\u201d and \u201cPeople\u201d also dropped, though overall it rose two places to fourth position. A visa for a Chinese visitor to the UK lasts a year, but costs the same about as a 10-year visa to the US, she says. Marcus Lee, CEO of China Travel Online says that visa efficiency is one of the top three drivers for Chinese tourists. Visitors from the Gulf states have increased since the UK introduced a speedy \u201celectronic travel authorization\u201d scheme to fast-track their applications, says Yates. The scheme was due to expand to Europe and US markets \u2013 it will now be up to the Labour government to do so. Meanwhile the self-styled \u201chostile environment\u201d towards immigration of the last government hasn\u2019t helped either. \u201cFor tourism, we want an efficient and effective border, but we do want people to come,\u201d she says. \u201cWe need to think about language.\u201d She says that people who visit the UK on vacation are 18% more likely to invest in the country \u2013 and investment is something the new government will be looking for. Brexit side effects As a result of Brexit, in 2021 the UK government abolished tax-free shopping for non-EU citizens. It means the UK is now the only European country not offering tax-free shopping to visitors from outside the continent. Data from London retail promoter New West End Company in February showed that although visitor numbers in 2023 to the area were just 4% below 2019 levels, spending was down 19%. Visitors from the Gulf states \u2013 some of the wealthiest tourists to grace the UK \u2013 were up 20% on 2019 figures, yet they only spent 10% more. The pattern was repeated with tourists from across the globe. US tourists were up 8% but spent 14% less. In Italy and Spain, however, US spending was up by 143% and 179% respectively. \u201cThe impact of losing tax-free shopping is clear to see,\u201d says Dee Corsi, chief executive of the NWEC. \u201cWhile the UK strives to return to pre-pandemic levels of travel and spend, continental Europe\u2019s recovery continues at pace. \u201cWhilst the likes of Italy and France are actively leveraging tax-free shopping as a driver of growth, British businesses continue to trade at a disadvantage. With domestic spend remaining squeezed, a continued decline of tourist spending will have a knock-on effect on employment rates, inward investment, and supply chains across the nation.\u201d She calls bringing back tax-free shopping a \u201crare, golden opportunity for the government to\u2026 inject a shot of growth back into the economy, with a tried-and-tested scheme and a captive audience.\u201d \u201cWe would urge the new government to grasp this opportunity with both hands,\u201d she adds. Meanwhile, EU citizens now need a passport to visit the UK, where pre-Brexit they could cross the border with their ID cards. In 2021, Jenkins told CNN that three-quarters of Europeans don\u2019t have passports. Then there are clouds on the horizon regarding getting in and out. When the new ETIAS scheme launches, every traveler entering the Schengen area for the first time will need their biometric data captured. \u201cIt\u2019ll be time consuming initally,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s evidence that really bad entry systems deter people.\u201d \u2019Bridgerton\u2019 to the rescue? So what can be done? For Zyonse, VisitBritain should spend that marketing budget on attracting influencers and travel advisors to lesser-known destinations. A self-declared lover of the UK, who calls London \u201ca better version of New York,\u201d she says that the post-pandemic drive for more \u201cepic\u201d adventures calls for a different approach. Timelapse videos of an elevator going up London\u2019s Shard skyscraper, or something more wild in the Lake District, could attract social media likes, she says. She also thinks that the \u201cmajority\u201d of US family trips are driven by children\u2019s choices. She just went to Greece to give her daughter a \u201cMamma Mia!\u201d experience, and says that the UK \u201cneeds to get young girls posting on social media wearing a crown, or having afternoon tea, or doing something \u2018Bridgerton\u2019-related.\u201d She\u2019ll approve of VisitBritain\u2019s next big campaign, then. Launching at the end of 2024, \u201cStarring Great Britain\u201d will revolve around filming locations, says Yates, who adds that her team also wants to promote cheaper, out-of-season travel. For Yates, the new government offers a chance to grow the industry. But she warns that the UK needs to revamp its international reputation, wishing for it \u201cto be seen internationally as a welcoming, culturally diverse, vibrant country that people want to visit, send their kids to school and invest in.\u201d With the new government promising change from day one, it might not be long until she sees her dreams coming true.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/uk-tourism-drop-visitor-numbers-election/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_04_asia_putin-xi-russia-china-alignment-sco-astana-intl-hnk", "text": "Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Thursday urged regional leaders to resist \u201cexternal interference\u201d at a gathering of a Eurasian security bloc touted by Beijing and Moscow as a counterbalance to Western power. Addressing the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO)\u2019s annual leaders\u2019 summit in Kazakhstan, Xi called on member states to \u201cconsolidate the power of unity\u201d in the face of \u201cthe real challenge of interference and division.\u201d \u201cWe should work together to resist external interference \u2026 and firmly grasp our own future and destiny, as well as regional peace and development, in our own hands,\u201d Xi was quoted as saying by Chinese state broadcaster CCTV. The 10-member bloc must handle internal differences with peace, seek common ground, and resolve difficulties in cooperation,\u00a0Xi\u00a0added. Founded in 2001 by China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan to combat terrorism and promote border security, the SCO has grown in recent years as Beijing and Moscow drive a transformation of the bloc from a regional security club with a focus on Central Asia to a geopolitical counterweight to Western institutions led by the United States and its allies. On Thursday, Belarus, a staunch Russian ally that helped Moscow launch its 2022 invasion of Ukraine, became the latest authoritarian state to join the SCO, after Iran\u00a0became a full member\u00a0last year. The bloc underwent its first expansion in 2017 to welcome India and Pakistan. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was notably absent from this year\u2019s event, further adding to the perception of the SCO\u2019s anti-Western orientation. At the summit, Xi warned against what he called \u201cthe real threat of Cold War mentality\u201d and called on member states to \u201cuphold our security baseline.\u201d He also urged countries to safeguard the right to development in the face of the \u201creal risks of small yards with high fences,\u201d referring to a strategy adopted by the US to restrict key technologies from China. The Chinese leader stressed the need to jointly promote scientific and technological innovation, and to maintain the stability and smoothness of industrial and supply chains. China-Russia alignment On the eve of the summit, Xi and Russian President Vladimir Putin \u2013 the two leaders driving the SCO\u2019s expansion \u2013 met on the sidelines and hailed their countries\u2019 deepening alignment. In opening remarks ahead of their bilateral meeting, Putin said Russia-China relations are going through \u201cthe best period in their history\u201d and should be considered a \u201cstabilizing\u201d force for the world. \u201cRussian-Chinese cooperation in\u00a0global affairs serves as\u00a0a\u00a0main stabilizing factor on\u00a0the\u00a0international stage, and\u00a0we continue to\u00a0further enhance it,\u201d Putin told Xi on Wednesday. The Russian president also underscored Moscow and Beijing\u2019s roles \u201cat the cradle\u201d of the SCO\u2019s founding and noted its rapid expansion in recent years. \u201cAs\u00a0the\u00a0number of\u00a0participants grew \u2026 the\u00a0SCO also gained a\u00a0bigger role as\u00a0one of\u00a0the\u00a0key pillars of\u00a0a\u00a0just multipolar world order,\u201d Putin said. The meeting\u00a0marks the two leaders\u2019 second face-to-face talks in just two months following\u00a0Putin\u2019s visit to Beijing\u00a0in May and comes shortly after the Russian president struck\u00a0a landmark defense pact\u00a0with North Korea. Much to the consternation of the US and Europe, China and Russia have\u00a0deepened their political, economic and military ties\u00a0since Putin and Xi declared a \u201cno limits\u201d partnership in February 2022 when the Russian leader visited Beijing, weeks before his full-scale invasion of Ukraine. China has surpassed the European Union to become Russia\u2019s top trade partner, offering a crucial lifeline to its heavily sanctioned economy. The two\u00a0nuclear-armed neighbors have also continued to hold joint military exercises, including with Iran. Meanwhile, the US has accused China of providing Russia with dual-use goods that bolster the warring nation\u2019s military industrial complex as it attacks Ukraine, which Beijing denies. In his opening remarks Wednesday, Xi told Putin that China and Russia should \u201ckeep upholding the original aspiration\u201d of their \u201clasting friendship\u201d in the face of \u201can international situation fraught with turbulence and changes.\u201d Xi also hailed the \u201cunique value\u201d in China-Russia relations, urging the two countries to make new efforts to safeguard their \u201clegitimate rights and interests\u201d and \u201cthe basic norms governing international relations.\u201d \u201cChina and Russia should continue to strengthen comprehensive strategic coordination, oppose external interference and jointly safeguard regional tranquility and stability,\u201d Xi said, according to a\u00a0readout\u00a0from China\u2019s Foreign Ministry.

{"id": "2024_07_04_uk_uk-election-exit-poll-results-labour-conservative-starmer-gbr-intl", "text": "Keir Starmer is the United Kingdom\u2019s new prime minister after sweeping away a 14-year era of Conservative rule by leading his center-left Labour party to a massive landslide election victory. British rejected the Conservatives by a historic margin, and Starmer will be a very powerful prime minister. But there are urgent issues needing his attention. And as the the dust settles on the election, a number of eye-opening trends are clear. Here\u2019s what you need to know. Labour\u2019s huge, but fragile, landslide Labour\u2019s victory was seismic. It was very nearly unprecedented; only Tony Blair\u2019s Labour Party has ever won more seats in an election. Addressing the nation before entering 10 Downing Street on Friday afternoon, Starmer pledged a return to the politics of public service, vowing to heal the \u201cweariness at the heart of the nation\u201d with \u201caction not words.\u201d But Labour\u2019s win was also fragile. The vote breakdown made clear that the election was as much, if not more, about the public\u2019s anger towards the Conservatives as it was about excitement for Labour\u2019s offer. Starmer\u2019s party only increased its vote share by a few percentage points from its dismal 2019 showing, even though it may end up with almost twice as many seats. Starmer won a smaller vote share than his predecessor Jeremy Corbyn did in 2017, an election that Labour also lost. It was helped in seat after seat by a strong showing from populists Reform UK, who tore votes away from the Conservatives. Those stats highlight the oddities of Britain\u2019s first-past-the-post voting system, but also the dangers facing Starmer. He will govern with a powerful majority in parliament, but the public coalition he has built will not afford him a long honeymoon period. He will be opposed by the Conservatives, but also by Reform, which challenged Labour candidates in several seats around the country. And a throng of left-wing support will also attempt to detract attention from Starmer; his predecessor Corbyn, who had been expelled by the party, won as an independent in Islington North and will become the face of that opposition. Starmer was far more popular than Sunak, opinion polls showed, but he has never enjoyed the healthy approval ratings that Blair and Boris Johnson once did, lacking the natural charisma or campaigning prowess of those leaders. \u201cElection victories don\u2019t fall from the sky. They\u2019re hard won, and hard fought for,\u201d he acknowledged in a speech earlier on Friday. Starmer has promised \u201ca decade of national renewal,\u201d a pledge that nods to the deep-seated problems in Britain\u2019s public services but also the lengthy stint he intends to spend in government. Whether or not he completes that goal could depend heavily on the early impression he leaves on the public as Prime Minister. In a sign of the potential fragility of Labour\u2019s landslide, turnout is on track to be the lowest for more than 20 years.\u00a0With all but two seats declared as of Friday afternoon, turnout was at 60%\u00a0\u2013 down from 67.3% at the last election in 2019. If confirmed, it would be only the second time in more than a century that 40% of voters decided to skip the vote. A devastating Conservative defeat Unlike Labour\u2019s victory, there are no two sides to the Conservatives\u2019 performance. This was a woeful showing, after a dreadful campaign, and it has consigned the Tories not just to opposition but to the cusp of irrelevance. Senior Conservatives fell like dominoes in seat after seat; the party was decimated by Labour and Reform in the so-called Red Wall swathe of battleground seats across North England and the Midlands, and by the Liberal Democrats in affluent areas in southern England that it had previously controlled for decades. And a line of high-profile figures \u2013 the faces of a 14-year era of power \u2013 stunningly lost their seats. Penny Mourdant, Jacob Rees-Mogg, Robert Buckland, Alex Chalk and others were dumped from power. The outgoing chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, narrowly clung on. And the most sensational defeat was saved until last: shortly after 6 a.m. Friday, in one of the final seats to declare, former Prime Minister Liz Truss lost her previously ultra-safe seat. She refused to speak after her defeat, leaving the stage with her fellow candidates instead, attempting to retain a steely look on her face. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Sunak told activists and voters after winning his count. There was not much more he could say. Before this election, only three Cabinet ministers had lost their seat this century, and all were Lib Dems serving in coalition with the Conservatives. It opened up a furious and bitter backlash within the party about what went wrong. \u201cOur renewal as a party and a country will not be achieved by us talking to an ever-smaller slice of ourselves, but by being guided by the people of this country,\u201d Mordaunt said after losing her seat, implicitly taking aim at the populist wing of the party, which has recently sought to pull it towards the right on issues such as migration. Buckland was blunter. \u201cI\u2019m fed up with performance art politics,\u201d Buckland told the BBC. \u201cI\u2019ve watched colleagues in the Conservative Party strike poses, write inflammatory op-eds and say stupid things they have no evidence for instead of concentrating on doing the job that they were elected to do. \u201cI think we\u2019ve seen in this election astonishing ill-discipline within the party,\u201d he added. A battle for control of the Tories For some of the Conservative lawmakers who survived the wipeout, there was little time for mourning. A battle to seize the leadership of the party is underway after Sunak announced he would step down as Tory leader. Senior MPs who ran in the two recent elections for the post were pointed in their speeches, doing little to hide their ambitions. And the fight could be bitter. Two wings have split the party over the course of the last parliament, and will seek to control it now \u2013 a populist bloc who have employed tough rhetoric on migration and sought to battle Reform for votes, and a moderate wing eager to drag the party back to its \u201cOne Nation\u201d roots. \u201cI\u2019m\u00a0sorry\u00a0that my party didn\u2019t listen to you,\u201d Britain\u2019s former hardline Home Secretary Suella Braverman said at her count, in a speech that could well have been addressed purely to the party members that will select its next leader. \u201c(The) Conservative Party has let you down. You \u2013 the great British people \u2013\u00a0voted for us over 14 years and we did not keep our promises,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve acted as if we\u2019re entitled to your vote regardless of what we did, regardless of what we didn\u2019t do, despite promising time after time that we would do those things and we need to learn our lesson because if we don\u2019t, bad as tonight has been for my party, we\u2019ll have many worse nights to come.\u201d Kemi Badenoch will enter the leadership race as the favorite, if she runs. But the outgoing business and trade minister didn\u2019t reveal much about her intentions in her speech, choosing instead to congratulate Labour. The rise of Reform The exit poll threw up a huge surprise, signalling 13 seats for Reform \u2014 but the real results weren\u2019t as kind. The insurgent bloc didn\u2019t pick up all of the seats it was forecast \u2013 with almost all the votes counted, it has ended up with five \u2013 but it was a disruptive force throughout the night, leaping the Conservatives into second place in dozens of seats up and down the country. Nigel Farage, the group\u2019s leader who had tried seven times to win election to parliament, succeeded on the eight attempt and will become a noisy and trouble-making presence in Westminster. \u201cIt\u2019s not just disappointment with the Conservative Party. There is a massive gap on the center right of British politics and my job is to fill it. And that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m going to do,\u201d Farage said after winning the seat. He pledged to \u201cchallenge the general election properly in 2029,\u201d and promised to turn his rhetoric towards Labour as they prepare to enter government. Farage said the \u201cLabour government will be in trouble very, very quickly and we will now be targeting Labour votes. We\u2019re coming for Labour - be in no doubt about that.\u201d But in the short term, Farage will also be a prominent outside voice as the Conservatives decide on their next direction as the new opposition party. Reform\u2019s relative success follows a tone of populist fury across Europe, though it will remain a minor party in parliament. They benefited hugely from the Conservatives\u2019 failure to control legal and illegal migration, an issue it nonetheless placed at the center of their campaign. Scotland\u2019s independence movement suffers a staggering setback Ten years after Scotland voted to remain a part of the United Kingdom, the 2024 election left the prospect of another such poll dim. Labour rolled back into place as the most popular party in Scotland, picking up several of its target seats from the Scottish National Party (SNP). The pro-independence\u00a0 group has dominated Scottish politics for a generation, and had won the most seats in three consecutive Westminster elections. But the SNP has suffered a torrid period in the last two years, cycling through three leaders in that time. And Labour, a pro-union party, capitalized on that trend, winning seats in Edinburgh and across southern Scotland. The Lib Dems also grabbed a handful of seats from the SNP, which may be left with fewer than ten seats. They won 48 at the last election, and became Britain\u2019s third largest party. The SNP still controls the Scottish Parliament, a devolved body that holds separate elections. The next election for the Scottish Parliament doesn\u2019t have to take place until 2026. But the party\u2019s majority in Holyrood is very narrow, and they are in a deeply diminished position after Thursday\u2019s vote. It means they cannot now meaningfully push for another independence referendum, which they would need the permission of the Westminster government to hold. The once very real possibility of Scotland breaking from its centuries-long but occasionally awkward union with England, Wales and Northern Ireland will likely now be shelved for a generation. Green Party quadruples its seat number \u2013 to four It was a very good night for the Green Party which won four seats in the Parliament, three more seats compared to the last election in 2019. While the party stood candidates in a record number of constituencies in this election, its official goal was to win four seats. The Greens succeeded in all four. They won comfortably in Brighton Pavilion, their long-time and, until now, only stronghold. But they also managed to take two seats away from the Conservatives, in the traditionally rural constituencies of North Herefordshire and Waveney Valley. The Greens also won in Bristol Central, which was previously held by Labour seat. Anger over Labour\u2019s Gaza stance On a very positive night for the Labour Party, there were a handful of disappointments. Labour\u2019s shadow culture minister Thangam Debbonaire lost her seat to the Green Party, giving Starmer an early decision to make about a Cabinet post. But more troubling was the party\u2019s slideback in parts of the country with a large Muslim population, a continuation of a trend seen too in local elections since Israel\u2019s war against Hamas in Gaza began. Starmer\u2019s stance against Israel\u2019s military campaign has hardened over time but his initial, unequivocal defense of Israel\u2019s intervention in Gaza was criticized by some on Labour\u2019s left and has been exploited by the Greens and independents in some seats. Starmer has since called for a ceasefire and the return of Israeli hostages held by the militant group in the enclave. Shockat Adam beat senior Labour figure Jonathan Ashworth in a stunning upset, after campaigning mainly on the issue. Labour only narrowly defeated George Galloway in Rochdale, where Galloway did the same. Perhaps most shockingly of all, Labour\u2019s shadow health secretary Wes Streeting clung onto his seat by just 528 votes, after a strong challenge by British-Palestinian independent Leanne Mohamad. Labour will take extremely seriously the votes it lost across the country over the issue of Gaza. And a sizeable if disorganized throng of independents elected, in large part, over the issue may seek to unite to elevate their cause in Parliament.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/uk/uk-election-exit-poll-results-labour-conservative-starmer-gbr-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "world"}}

The latest people to be apprehended were the former commanding general of the air force, a sergeant accused of ramming a military vehicle into the government palace, another sergeant accused of driving a separate vehicle carrying military leaders, and an infantry captain accused of coordinating the movement of troops, according to Government Minister Eduardo del Castillo. The news brings the total number of arrests to 21. Wednesday\u2019s coup attempt prompted shock around the world, with images out of the capital La Paz showing military personnel occupying a square, armored vehicles ramming the palace door and soldiers trying to break into government offices. A report sent to CNN by the Bolivian government said military officials first held meetings in May to plot the coup attempt. The meetings were led by former army chief Gen. Juan Jose Z\u00fa\u00f1iga and former navy commander Gen. Juan Arnez, with Z\u00fa\u00f1iga\u2019s civilian personal adviser allegedly devising the \u201cstrategy\u201d of the coup, the report claims. All three men are\u00a0among those arrested so far. The Bolivian Attorney General\u2019s Office said Friday that Z\u00fa\u00f1iga had been ordered into pretrial detention for six months.

{"id": "2024_07_05_asia_japan-us-fighter-jets-intl-hnk-ml", "text": "The US military will send dozens of its newest fighter jets to Japan as part of a $10 billion upgrade of its forces in the country, the Defense Department announced Wednesday. In a news release, the Pentagon said the effort would be carried out \u201cover the next several years\u201d to \u201cenhance the US-Japan Alliance, bolster regional deterrence, and strengthen peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.\u201d The modernization plan will see 48 fifth-generation F-35A fighters replace 36 F-16s at Misawa Air Base in northern Japan, and 36 brand-new F-15EX jets deploy to Kadena Air Base on the southern island of Okinawa, replacing 48 older F-15C/D models that have been pulled from the region in the past year, the Pentagon release said. At Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni, just south of Hiroshima on the main island of Honshu, the number of deployed F-35B aircraft will be modified, the Pentagon said, without giving specific numbers. \u201cThe Department\u2019s plan to station the Joint Force\u2019s most advanced tactical aircraft in Japan demonstrates the ironclad U.S. commitment to the defense of Japan and both countries\u2019 shared vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific region,\u201d the news release said. Japan said basing the new fighter aircraft in the country would enhance US capabilities there. \u201cIn the face of the most severe and complex security environment since the end of World War II, and amidst the increased military activities of neighboring countries, the United States is maintaining and strengthening the presence of U.S. forces in Japan to further enhance the deterrence and response capabilities of the Japan-U.S. alliance,\u201d Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi, the government\u2019s top spokesman, said at a regular briefing Thursday. Japan\u2019s alliance with the US has become increasingly important in a region that is seeing China, Russia and North Korea all pose threats that Tokyo seeks to counter. Japan has festering territorial disputes in the north with Russia and with China over islands in the East China Sea. Meanwhile, North Korea\u2019s growing missile program, which has seen Pyongyang send missiles over Japanese territory in recent years, draws condemnation from Tokyo with every projectile test. Japan also keeps a wary eye on the situation surrounding Taiwan, the self-ruled democratic island that the Chinese Communist Party has vowed to bring under Beijing\u2019s control, by force if necessary. As much as 90% of Japan\u2019s energy supplies come via sea lanes near Taiwan, according to Tokyo, which sees the status quo around the island as key to its security. Okinawa is only about 450 miles (725 kilometers) from Taiwan, and both the US and Japan maintain key air bases on the island. US air power in Japan The US Air Force calls the Kadena Air Base, home of the 18th Wing, its \u201cKeystone of the Pacific,\u201d and for more than four decades the older model F-15s based there were central to US deterrence in the region. But from 2022, as the twin-engine fighters neared the end of their service life, the US Air Force began pulling them from Kadena. While the service has rotated other assets through the air base since, to cover the absence of the older F-15s, the permanent presence of the F-15EXs will bring stability to the force structure. The F-15EX is a leap above the older models. Manufacturer Boeing says the jet has \u201cunparalleled weapons capacity,\u201d with an ability to carry 12 advanced medium-range, air-to-air missiles (AMRAAM) and\u00a0to fire them from a range \u201cfarther than any other fighter in the US Air Force arsenal.\u201d Although not a stealth fighter like the F-35, Boeing says the F-15EX has next-generation survivability. \u201cIt serves as a long-range standoff weapons system that is also capable of penetrating and surviving in highly contested environments,\u201d the company says on its website. Military aviation analyst Peter Layton said the F-15EXs would be a worry for China in the event of any conflict. The jet can be fitted with stealthy long-range cruise missiles with a range of more than 500 miles (800 kilometers) that could strike inside the Chinese mainland, he said. Newer missiles under development could double that distance, he added. \u201cThat will hold at risk even more Chinese mainland military bases and offer a very quick attack option,\u201d Layton said. The F-15EX is the Air Force\u2019s newest fighter jet, with the first operational plane delivered to the Oregon Air National Guard in early June. The F-35As that will be stationed at Misawa Air Base are the Air Force\u2019s newest stealth fighters. They\u2019ve long been designated as the replacement for F-16s in the USAF inventory. F-35s deliver \u201can enhanced capability to survive in the advanced threat environment in which it was designed to operate,\u201d an Air Force fact sheet says. Layton said the F-15EXs and F-35As complement each other well in a combat scenario. \u201cThe F-35 is an excellent low-observable sensor platform that could operate forward in stealth mode relaying data back to patrolling F-15EXs with their supersonic cruise and large air-to-air missile load outs,\u201d said Layton, a fellow at the Griffith Asia Institute in Australia and former Royal Australian Air Force officer. The aircraft deployments add to other improvements Washington has been making to its force structure in Japan, where the US has more than 50,000 troops. Okinawa houses more than 25,000 US military personnel and more than two dozen military installations. Roughly 70% of the US military bases in Japan are on Okinawa. The US and Japan announced last year that a newly redesignated Marine unit with advanced intelligence, surveillance capabilities and the ability to fire anti-ship missiles would be based in Japan.

{"id": "2024_07_04_weather_west-heatwave-wildfires-california-butte", "text": "The West is sizzling under a major, prolonged heatwave through July 4 and beyond that\u2019s bringing triple-digit temperatures and fueling wildfire risk as thousands have had to flee their homes from an advancing Northern California blaze. The Thompson Fire has consumed over 3,700 acres in California\u2019s Butte County since it was reported Tuesday, drawing hundreds of firefighters to battle the flames under the extreme heat in the Oroville, California, area. As of Thursday morning, the fire is 7% contained, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. The fire has injured 11 firefighters, according to Chris Peterson, a California Fire spokesperson. Heat-related illnesses have affected eight firefighters, who have been evaluated and are in the process of being cleared, Peterson said. Three other firefighters were hurt when a fire engine was involved in a rollover accident Wednesday morning, Peterson said. All three were taken to the hospital and two have since been released. As of Thursday morning, 12,000 residents living in and around Oroville remain under evacuation orders, Peterson said. At least four structures have been destroyed and more than 12,000 remain threatened by the fire, according to a Cal Fire\u00a0incident update. Oroville resident Rachael Thompson could see the flames and smoke from her backyard before she and three of her\u00a0family\u00a0members fled their home\u00a0Tuesday night. \u201cIt was a rough night for our\u00a0family,\u201d Thompson\u00a0told CNN\u00a0in\u00a0a message.\u00a0\u201cThe smoke\u00a0in\u00a0our home was\u00a0incredibly bad even with 4 purifiers going.\u201d Though she has since received word that the fire has moved away from her home, she worries for her neighbors and friends, many of whom are displaced and don\u2019t know if their homes are still standing. \u201cWe hope our friends and\u00a0family\u2019s homes make it and that they\u2019re all safe,\u201d she said. Californians are all too familiar with the sudden devastation that wildfires bring. The Thompson Fire is burning just 20 miles south of Paradise, where California\u2019s deadliest wildfire killed 85 people and destroyed thousands of homes in 2018. There are now over two dozen active wildfires of varying sizes burning across California, and the Thompson Fire is among the largest, according to Cal Fire. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing fires on the coast in San Diego, to the foothills in Butte,\u201d Cal Fire Deputy Director Nick Schuler told CNN Wednesday. \u201cOur\u00a0firefighters are battling fires across California and often times on the line for more than 24 hours. It\u2019s difficult conditions that they face.\u201d California Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency for the area of the Thompson Fire Wednesday, clearing the path for additional resources, including the possibility of mobilizing the California National Guard to assist. The state\u2019s been seeing an active fire season, with 139,590 acres burned so far in 2024 compared to 7,812 acres burned by this time last year, according to Cal Fire. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen so far in California \u2013 more than 600% increase in wildfires,\u201d Schuler told CNN. The extreme heat is combining with gusty winds and low humidity to set the stage for rapid fire spread through already parched vegetation, and it represents another obstacle for firefighters battling the blaze. Red flag warnings are in effect across the West, including in the Thompson Fire zone. \u201cThis winter we enjoyed a lot of precipitation and that brought a lot of vegetation that was green just a few weeks ago,\u201d Schuler said. \u201cNow, with that heat increased temperatures drying out, resulting in rapid fire growth across the state.\u201d The Basin Fire in California\u2019s Fresno County is 46% contained at 13,980 acres. Meanwhile, firefighters have the Fresno June Lightning Complex nearly fully contained to 10,669 acres. \u201cFirefighters are likely to have a very challenging week ahead,\u201d Cal Fire officials said in a video update Tuesday. \u201cAll it takes is one spark to start a major wildfire putting lives at risk.\u201d Oroville will see\u00a0record temperatures of 110 or more each of the next five days. Saturday may reach an\u00a0all-time record high of 113 \u2013 making it that much harder for fire crews to fight the blaze. No relief from the extreme heat for days Record-breaking heat is making the Fourth of July week a dangerous one across much of the West and from the southern Plains to the Mid-Atlantic. Nationwide, more than 140 million people across more than 20 states in parts of the South and West are under heat alerts \u2013 and there will be no relief until the middle of next week. \u201cThe duration of this heat is also concerning as scorching above average temperatures are forecast to linger into next week,\u201d the National Weather Service said. \u201cHeat impacts can compound over time, therefore it is important to remain weather aware and follow the advice of local officials.\u201d Extreme heat\u00a0is one of the leading weather-related killers in the United States, leaving hundreds of people dead each year, according to the National Weather Service. Parts of Oregon will also experience triple digits Friday, and the heat could last up to five days with noted poor overnight relief, says the National Weather Service Portland. Jessica Vega Pederson, chair of Multnomah Country, declared a state of emergency effective this weekend, noted a news release from the county Wednesday. Multnomah County\u2019s health officer, Dr. Richard Bruno, said in a news release: \u201cI\u2019m particularly worried about the thousands of people heading to music festivals and sporting events this weekend. They\u2019ll be spending a long time outside, may have little access to shade and water and may not recognize the risk.\u201d Multnomah County is the state\u2019s most populous county and home to Portland, where Mayor Ted Wheeler has also declared a state of emergency. Starting Friday, the cities of Hood River, Portland and Salem are all forecast for temperatures of 100 Fahrenheit over a five-day span, according to the National Weather Service. Eugene will face a four-day stretch of 100 Fahrenheit temps. Noah Alviz, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service of Portland, told CNN via phone: \u201cIn June 2021, for a heatwave here in northwest Oregon and southwest Washington \u2026 Portland reached an all-time record of 116. Now, with this heatwave, we\u2019re not expecting temperatures to get as intense as that. However, what we are more concerned about is the duration of this heatwave.\u201d During the summer of 2021, Multnomah County reported 72 heat deaths with \u201call but three of those deaths resulting from a single five-day heat wave in June,\u201d according to the county. \u201cThat is a big concern from us when we see heat of this magnitude in our area,\u201d Alviz said. There is the additional concern of staying cool in an area where many don\u2019t have air conditioning, Alviz says, which has resulted in the opening of numerous cooling shelters in Multnomah County. Meanwhile, much of California, excluding the coastal regions, as well as western Nevada and southwestern Arizona, are expected to see searing high temperatures from 100 to 110 degrees \u2013 about 10 to 20 degrees above normal. Las Vegas, Nevada, could exceed its all-time high temperature of 117 degrees Sunday or Monday, and Death Valley, California, could approach 130 degrees by Sunday. As the heat dome expands north, above-normal temperatures are expected to hit parts of Oregon and Washington beginning Friday, with high temperatures ranging between 95 to 105 degrees.  Some cities could swelter through multiple days of temperatures well above 100 degrees with some, including Sacramento, potentially\u00a0seeing a full week of highs over 105 degrees. Already, several cities have set or tied daily high-temperature records, with Fresno and Livermore both hitting 110 degrees Wednesday. Heat\u00a0is expected to spread to\u00a0the\u00a0Northwest and to parts of Arizona\u00a0including Phoenix by\u00a0the\u00a0weekend, where triple-digit temperatures are expected, with parts of Arizona\u00a0seeing highs above 110 degrees.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/weather/west-heatwave-wildfires-california-butte/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_05_europe_kara-murza-russia-prison-hospital-intl", "text": "Vladimir Kara-Murza, a Russian opposition politician serving a lengthy jail sentence for treason, has been transferred to a prison hospital, his wife Evgenia said Friday. Kara-Murza, 42, was moved from the maximum-security IK-6 penal colony in the Siberian city of Omsk to a prison hospital in another part of the region, she said in a series of posts on X. His lawyers have not been allowed to see him and have been given contradictory information by hospital staff, she added. After arriving at IK-6 from Moscow, Kara-Murza\u2019s lawyers were made to wait for five hours before being told they could not see him, she said. They were later told to come back the next day. When the lawyers returned Friday morning, they were informed he was still being examined by doctors and had not yet been fully processed. They were told later Friday that they still could not see Kara-Murza, and that the correctional facility would be closed over the weekend, she said. \u201cThe lawyers were never able to see Vladimir and make sure that everything was okay with him,\u201d she wrote, saying that Kara-Murza has been suffering from polyneuropathy, \u201ca disease caused by two severe poisonings.\u201d Kara-Murza has claimed he was twice poisoned with the Soviet-era nerve agent Novichok \u2013 in 2015 and in 2017 \u2013 which caused him to suffer multiple organ failure and fall into a coma. The Kremlin has denied any involvement in his illness, but Kara-Murza has long maintained there was \u201cno other possible reason\u201d for it than a politically motivated attack. In an interview with CNN shortly before his arrest in 2022, Kara-Murza criticized the Kremlin for its persecution of its political opponents and invasion of Ukraine. \u201cThese people have a literally decades-long track record of going after their political opponents. Poison has been a particularly favored method because it gives them \u2013 or at least it did until all of these media investigations came out \u2013 plausible deniability,\u201d Kara-Murza told CNN. \u201cThis regime that is in power in our country today, it\u2019s not just corrupt, it\u2019s not just kleptocratic, it\u2019s not just kleptocratic, it\u2019s not just authoritarian \u2013 it is a regime of murderers. And it is important to say it out loud,\u201d he said, adding it was \u201ctragic\u201d that it took the invasion of Ukraine for Western countries to \u201copen their eyes\u201d to the danger of Putin\u2019s regime. He was arrested shortly afterward and later sentenced to 25 years in prison, in a decision condemned as politically motivated and draconian by the international community. Asked by CNN why he had chosen to return to Russia after recovering from his poisoning \u2013 and knowing the risks faced by Kremlin critics \u2013 he said: \u201cI\u2019m a Russian politician. I have to be in Russia. It\u2019s my home country. I think the biggest gift we could give \u2013 those of us who are in opposition to Putin\u2019s regime \u2013 to the Kremlin, is to give up and run. I mean, that\u2019s all they want from us.\u201d Since the death of Alexei Navalny in an Arctic prison in February, Kara-Murza has been the most prominent Russian opposition figure persecuted by the Kremlin. A joint investigation by CNN and the group Bellingcat implicated the Russian Security Service (FSB) in poisoning Navalny during a trip to Siberia in August 2020. The investigation found that the FSB toxins team of about six to 10 agents trailed Navalny for more than three years before poisoning him via his underpants.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/europe/kara-murza-russia-prison-hospital-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_04_europe_ukraine-russia-chasiv-yar-part-seized-intl", "text": "Russian troops have taken control of parts of a key hilltop town in eastern Ukraine, a strategic gain that could pose major problems for Ukrainian troops trying to defend the area from further advances. The relatively small town of Chasiv Yar has played an outsized role in the conflict and has been battered by months of intense fighting. Sitting on high ground, it is seen as a gateway to the parts of the Donetsk region that are still in Ukrainian hands. The town overlooks the lower-laying areas to the north, towards the bigger cities of Kramatorsk and Slovyansk, and to the west towards Dnipropetrovsk\u00a0region. The Russian Defense Ministry said on Thursday that its troops have taken over the easternmost district of Chasiv Yar. Meanwhile, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian military said that Kyiv forces retreated from the district after their defensive positions were destroyed and it became clear that efforts to hold onto the neighborhood were becoming \u201cinexpedient\u201d because of the risk to the defending troops. \u201cOver the last day, 238 attacks from all types of weapons were recorded in the Chasiv Yar area,\u201d Nazar Voloshyn, the spokesperson for Ukraine\u2019s \u201cKhortytsia\u201d operational and strategic grouping, told a Ukrainian national television channel. At the same time, Ukrainian monitoring group DeepState said Russian forces were reportedly moving towards a strategically important road that connects Bakhmut, which has been in Russian hands for more than a year, with Konstantinivka and Pokrovsk. The road is a key supply line for the Ukrainian military. The withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from parts of Chasiv Yar is a troubling development for Kyiv as it focuses on stabilizing the frontlines following months of relentless Russian assaults. Moscow took advantage of the acute shortages of ammunition experienced by Kyiv due to delays in Western military aid in the first half of this year, trying to pierce Ukraine\u2019s defensive lines alongside the eastern frontline. It even launched a surprise cross-border offensive in northern Ukraine in order to force Kyiv to pull some troops away from the east. But the situation was starting to look better for Ukraine in recent weeks after Western weapons finally started arriving on the frontlines. A possible major Russian offensive towards Kharkiv, the second-largest Ukrainian city, was averted and the eastern front appeared more stable. Higher ground Ukraine has insisted that it is still firmly in control of the western parts of Chasiv Yar and that the withdrawal from the eastern part was a tactical decision. DeepState, the monitoring group, said the district \u201chas been completely wiped out\u201d and \u201cholding it in ruins\u201d would only increase losses. \u201cLeaving the neighborhood is a logical, albeit a difficult decision,\u201d it said. The town had a pre-war population of about 12,000, but has been mostly deserted for months. Vadym Filashkin, the head of Donetsk regional military administration, said in May that some 679 civilians were still in Chasiv Yar, refusing to evacuate their homes. \u201cCapturing Chasiv Yar would allow the Russians to bring in more (First Person View) drones, drone operators and artillery into the area, and it would give them an advantageous position to conduct ground strikes and drone strikes on Ukrainian troops,\u201d Konrad Muzyka, a defense analyst who has been tracking the conflict closely, told CNN in an interview. Russian President Vladimir Putin has made no secret of the fact that he wants his forces to control the whole of Donestk. The region was dissected in half when the war broke out in 2014 after Russian-backed rebels seized government buildings in towns and cities across eastern parts of the region. While Russia took control of a other parts of Donetsk following the launch of its full-scale invasion in February 2022, it never managed to occupy the whole of the region. If Chasiv Yar was to fall to Russian hands, it could put bigger cities to the west at risk. \u201cChasiv Yar the largest settlement on the way to Kramatorsk, so if Russians were to capture it, then the Ukrainians would not necessarily have the chances to rely on urban settlements to decrease the tempo of Russian attacks,\u201d Muzyka said. Advancing through an urban environment is much more difficult compared to open terrain. Chasiv Yar itself has been the epicenter of the fight for months. Bakhmut, which sits about 10 kilometers (6 miles) east of Chasiv Yar, fell to Russia at a huge cost to its troops in May 2023, after many months of intense fighting. By the time Moscow claimed control over the city, it was almost completely destroyed.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/europe/ukraine-russia-chasiv-yar-part-seized-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_07_06_middleeast_palestinians-displaced-gaza-israel-intl", "text": "Nearly 2 million people have been displaced in Gaza \u2013 almost the entire population \u2013 after the Israeli military last week ordered a further 80,000 people to evacuate parts of Gaza City amid a renewed ground operation, latest UN figures show. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has stepped up assaults in several parts of the Strip, including the Shujaya neighborhood in the north, where it previously said it had dismantled Hamas. UNRWA, the main UN agency for Palestinian refugees, estimates that up to 1.9 million people in Gaza have been internally displaced \u2013 about 90% of the population of the Strip, estimated by the UN to be around 2.1 million people. The number of displaced people rose from 1.7 million since Israel launched its offensive on the southern city of Rafah in May. The fresh flurry of offensives raises questions about how and when Israel will wind down its war, which has been fought for nearly nine months with the aims of destroying Hamas\u2019 military and governing capacities and rescuing Israeli hostages. Israeli officials had said its incursion into Rafah \u2013 the southernmost point of Gaza to which Hamas was thought to have regrouped after Israel\u2019s destruction of the north \u2013 would be the final stage of its war, but the uptick in fighting in the north suggests Hamas retains an ongoing presence. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said Saturday that 80,000 people have been displaced this week after the IDF issued evacuation orders in eastern areas of Gaza City. Renewed offensives In Shujaya, the IDF said Saturday that its combat teams had fought \u201carmed squads\u201d of Hamas militants over the past 24 hours, \u201cdestroying weapons and terrorist infrastructures above and below the ground.\u201d It said its soldiers ambushed a group of Hamas fighters and \u201celiminated all the terrorists without any casualties to our forces,\u201d and that an air strike had wiped out a terrorist squad with rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) launchers. Gaza\u2019s Civil Defense told CNN on Saturday that Israeli bombing in the area has continued \u201cwithout stopping.\u201d \u201cThe situation in Shujaya has been the same for 10 days and our crews cannot enter to save lives there,\u201d it said. Meanwhile, operations have also continued in southern Rafah, where the bulk of Palestinian civilians had initially been displaced. The IDF said it had eliminated a number of \u201cterrorist cells\u201d and underground structures. The IDF did not provide a figure for the number of airstrikes in Gaza over the past 24 hours. The fighting is continuing to take a huge toll on civilians, many of whom have been displaced nine or 10 times already. One man displaced in Khan Younis told CNN about the hours needed to get hold of small amounts of clean water. \u201cLife in tents is very difficult. We live on sand. Clothes get dirty. Hands get dirty. The body needs to be cleaned. Dining utensils need to be cleaned,\u201d Zakaria Bakr, from the Al-Shati camp, told CNN Saturday. He said his children often have to fetch water for the family. \u201cThe children live a life that is not their own and they have never known this suffering before,\u201d he said. On Friday, UNRWA posted a video of people in makeshift tents on a beach in the central city of Nuseirat, saying they were \u201cbuilding sand walls to protect themselves from the incoming tide.\u201d \u201cThere are few safe spaces left for families to move to,\u201d it said. \u201cMany families rely on seawater for washing, cleaning and even drinking.\u201d Elsewhere in Nuseirat, three journalists were killed Saturday in a strike on an apartment building, the Hamas-run government media office told CNN. Since Friday, two other journalists have also been killed in other parts of the Strip, it said. CNN is asking the IDF for comment on the Nuseirat strike. Across the Strip, fuel shortages are threatening work at hospitals, and in distributing the trickle of aid passing into Gaza.

After none of the four initial candidates secured more than 50% of the vote on June 28, reformist lawmaker Masoud Pezeshkian and ultraconservative former nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili emerged as the two candidates with the most votes, with Pezeshkian leading by 3.9 percentage points. The first round, however, saw the lowest voter turnout for a presidential election since the Islamic Republic was established in 1979, highlighting the discontent among a population losing faith in the country\u2019s ruling clerical establishment. Pezeshkian and Jalili are on opposite ends of the Iranian political spectrum. Each candidate could lead Iran in a starkly different manner at a time when the Islamic Republic is grappling with delicate domestic and international problems \u2013 including an economy in tatters, a restive youth movement and escalating tensions with Israel and the United States. Here\u2019s what to expect on Friday\u2019 second round of elections, and how the results could impact Iran and the world. What happened in the first round? The snap election was held after Raisi died in a helicopter crash on May 19 in the country\u2019s remote northwest, along with Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian and other officials. Three conservatives and a single reformist candidate vied  for the country\u2019s top elected seat, after dozens of other candidates were barred from standing by the powerful 12-member Guardian Council, which is tasked with overseeing elections and legislation, and reports directly to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. During the first round, Pezeshkian led with 42.5% of the votes, followed by Jalili with 38.6%, according to the state news agency IRNA. Out of 60 million eligible voters, 24 million cast their ballots, resulting in a 40% turnout. The record low turnout \u2013 in a country where presidential elections usually command more than 60% \u2013\u00a0came despite Khamenei urging Iranians to show \u201cmaximum participation\u201d in order to strengthen the Islamic Republic against its adversaries. Iranians who spoke to CNN in Tehran ahead of the first vote expressed little faith in the those running, especially as candidates are vetted by the Guardian Council. The turnout suggests that \u201cthis anger and disillusionment with the regime as a whole is really not limited to the reformists,\u201d Trita Parsi, a Washington-based Iran analyst and executive vice president of the Quincy Institute, told CNN. \u201cEven amongst conservatives there seems to be a lot of anger and disillusionment with the system, because their participation was very low as well.\u201d Nevertheless, analysts say critical shifts may be taking place among voters ahead of the second round. Some conservatives \u2013 including those who in the first round supported hardliner Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf \u00a0\u2013 appear to be moving their support to the reformist Pezeshkian at the expense of his conservative opponent Jalili. Is the conservative camp fracturing? \u201cYou\u2019ve clearly have had a split amongst the conservatives,\u201d Parsi told CNN, including within the elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), in which Jalili previously served. Analysts suggest that some conservatives believe it\u2019s necessary to shift away from some of the uncompromising policies of the late President Raisi, which Jalili is likely to continue. One of those conservatives is Sardar Mohsen Rashid, a founder and senior member of the IRGC. Rashid declared his support for Pezeshkian on Monday and called on people to defend him against \u201ccowardly attacks,\u201d according to the conservative Iranian news site Khabar Online. In a move that shocked observers, the man who led Ghalibaf\u2019s electoral campaign, Sami Nazari Tarkarani, also declared his support for reformist Pezeshkian, Khabar Online reported. While it is unclear whether that shift while be reflected on the ground, other supporters of Ghalibaf said they are trying to sway conservatives and silent voters to\u00a0also back the reformist candidate instead. The splits among conservatives also show that sentiments within camps are not homogenous, analysts said. \u201cThe type of anti-establishment sentiments are not limited to just the reformists, you also have it in the ranks of the IRGC,\u201d Parsi said, adding that the current rifts are particularly notable given efforts by the regime to concentrate power only in the hands of the conservatives. Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa Programme at the Chatham House think tank in London, said that Iranian politics is factional and divided, adding that \u201cnot everyone in the IRGC supports or favors conservative or hardline politics.\u201d What would a win for Pezeshkian mean? In a presidential debate on Monday, both candidates appeared intent on garnering votes from the 60% of the electorate that did not participate, experts said. \u201cPezeshkian is adopting more radical rhetoric to attract nonvoters,\u201d Sina Toossi, an Iran analyst and senior fellow at the Center for International Policy in Washington, DC, wrote on X. \u201cMeanwhile, Jalili is trying to soften his image, and has agreed with Pezeshkian numerous times.\u201d Pezeshkian, who comes from an Azeri-Kurdish family, has tried to appeal to minorities, women and the country\u2019s youth, Toossi wrote. The establishment appoints people from its \u201cown circles and excludes the rest of the population,\u201d the candidate said during the debate on Monday. Pezeshkian had famously criticized the regime\u2019s handling of the 2022 mass protests, saying that in an interview with Iran\u2019s IRINN TV: \u201cIt is our fault. We want to implement religious faith through the use of force. This is scientifically impossible.\u201d Addressing poverty in Iran, he said during the debate that \u201cthe problem of the poor is us,\u201d adding that if candidates want to increase voter turnout, \u201cthey (the voters) must believe that officials sit at the same table as they do.\u201d Millions in Iran are under the poverty line, often struggling to make ends meet in an economy that has for years been crippled by US sanctions. Iran\u2019s annual inflation rate hasn\u2019t dipped below 30% in over five years, and in June stood at 36.1%, straining wallets across the country. This persistent inflation follows the Trump administration\u2019s withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear agreement and the subsequent reimposition of heavy sanctions on the Islamic Republic. Pezeshkian stressed the need to re-start dialogue with the West and find a way to end the sanctions. Iran\u2019s relationship with the West has only worsened in recent months, with Tehran supporting militant groups across the Middle East that have targeted both Israeli and US interests amid the war in Gaza. The Islamic Republic has also escalated its nuclear program, pulling back cooperation with the UN\u2019s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency. What would a Jalili win mean? During the presidential debates, Jalili also sought to appeal to women and youth, saying that voices of students and young Iranians \u201cmust be heard.\u201d However, he stuck to his position that Iran should not rely on the West to ensure progress, a line echoed by the Supreme Leader in recent weeks. \u201cWe must make the enemy regret imposing sanctions,\u201d Jalili said, adding that Western threats must be turned into an opportunity, a line echoed by late President Raisi, who sought to solidify friendships with US foes\u00a0amid Western isolation. The candidates\u2019 opposing views come as rhetoric between Iran and Israel sharpens. The two countries exchanged direct fire for the first time in April as the Gaza conflict widened, and Israel is now preparing for a potential second front with Hezbollah, Iran\u2019s primary regional proxy, in Lebanon. Iran\u2019s mission to the UN said on Saturday that should Israel \u201cembark on full-scale military aggression\u201d against Lebanon, then \u201can obliterating war will ensue.\u201d \u201cAll options, including the full involvement of all Resistance Fronts, are on the table,\u201d it said on X. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz responded on Saturday, saying that \u201ca regime that threatens destruction deserves to be destroyed.\u201d How much autonomy would either candidate really have? The heated regional tensions raise questions about whether a reformist president can truly make a difference. Experts say it may not be as big of a chance as some in the West might hope. The Supreme Leader is the final arbiter on most decisions in Iran. But \u201cthat doesn\u2019t mean that the president and his foreign policy team are irrelevant,\u201d Ali Vaez, Iran project director at the International Crisis Group think tank, said. The president and his cabinet implement foreign policy, and have a lot of influence on the diplomatic apparatus of the country, Vaez told CNN\u2019s Becky Anderson in an interview on Monday. He noted that Pezeshkian\u2019s presidency would be very different from Jalili\u2019s as the reformist is surrounded by the \u201ccreme de la creme of Iranian diplomats.\u201d Iran\u2019s track record, however, shows that it has tended to take a more conservative trajectory in the long run, even when there has been a reformist president in place, experts said, adding that Tehran\u2019s regional policy toward Israel and its proxies is unlikely to change. When it comes to core policies in Iran, such as support for Hezbollah and animosity toward Israel, a reformist president is unlikely to make a difference, Parsi said, adding that there may however be better engagement with the West. Despite that, Jalili may bring more hardline policies to the table, and potentially double down on his predecessor\u2019s approach. Depending on the environment in the West, Jalili may take a \u201cmuch more confrontational approach to Iran\u2019s nuclear program,\u201d Vakil said, adding that despite the limitations on the president\u2019s freedom to act, each brings their \u201cown personal touch\u201d to Iran\u2019s government.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/middleeast/iran-presidential-election-round-two-pezeshkian-jalili-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "world"}}

Israeli officials believe Hamas\u2019 latest response will enable the two parties to enter detailed negotiations to reach an agreement, the source said. A deal, however, is still not finalized nor is it assured. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu must first green-light entering into that next phase of negotiations; and it will likely take several weeks of difficult negotiations to negotiate the details of a potential agreement, including the identities of Palestinian prisoners to be released in exchange for Israeli hostages held by Hamas and the sequencing of releases. Israeli negotiators are set to meet with Israel\u2019s political leadership, including Netanyahu, over the coming days to decide whether to enter this phase of detailed negotiations. Hamas has confirmed that it passed a response on an Israeli proposal to mediators Qatar and Egypt, repeating its demand for a complete ceasefire. \u201cWe have put forward some demands that achieve securing access to a complete ceasefire and the withdrawal of Israeli forces,\u201d Basem Naim, a member of Hamas\u2019 political bureau, told CNN on Wednesday.

{"id": "2024_07_06_weather_hurricane-beryl-south-texas-coast-weekend-sunday-monday", "text": "Tropical Storm Beryl will strengthen as it tracks toward the South Texas coast late this weekend, bringing a risk of damaging winds, life-threatening storm surge and dangerous flooding to Texas beginning late Sunday. It\u2019s expected to mark the first US landfall storm of the 2024 Atlantic season. Here\u2019s the latest: \u2022 Beryl expected to regain strength before landfall: Beryl, currently a tropical storm, has entered the Gulf of Mexico and was about 330 miles southeast of Corpus Christi, Texas, on Saturday evening. The storm has unloaded strong winds, torrential rainfall and dangerous storm surge over much of Mexico\u2019s Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula after hammering several Caribbean islands. Next, Beryl is expected to strengthen again Sunday ahead of its projected final landfall as a Category 1 hurricane in Southern Texas\u2019 Coastal Bend. \u2022 Hurricane and storm surge warnings and watches issued: Hurricane and storm surge warnings and watches were extended eastward along the Texas coast Saturday. A hurricane warning was issued Saturday afternoon for the Texas coast from Baffin Bay northward to Sargent. The coast is under a hurricane watch from the mouth of the Rio Grande north to San Luis Pass. A storm surge warning is in effect for the north entrance of the Padre Island National Seashore to High Island, including Corpus Christi Bay, Matagorda Bay and Galveston\u00a0Bay. A storm surge watch is in effect for the Texas coast from the mouth of the Rio Grande north to the Padre Island National Seashore\u2019s north entrance,\u00a0and San Luis Pass to Sabine Pass, including Galveston Bay. A tropical storm warning is in effect for the Texas coast south of Baffin Bay to the mouth of the Rio Grande, the state\u2019s coast north of Sargent to High Island and the northeastern coast of mainland Mexico from Barra el Mezquital to the mouth of the Rio Grande. \u2022\u00a0Beryl expected to slam South Texas: Beryl is forecast to make landfall near Corpus Christi as a Category 1 hurricane midday Monday, according to the National Hurricane Center. Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said the state is likely to start seeing the effects of Beryl starting Sunday into Monday. \u201cWe pray and we hope for nothing more of a rain event, but even a rain event may be very heavy,\u201d Patrick said. \u201cWe prepare at the state for the worst-case scenario.\u201d The first mandatory evacuation was issued Saturday afternoon for all of Refugio County in Texas. \u2022\u00a0Dangerous storm surge along US Gulf Coast: Tropical storm conditions will begin to be felt along the western Gulf Coast on Sunday, with hurricane conditions expected later in the day. Storm surge up to 6 feet is forecast for southern parts of the Texas coast. Heavy rainfall of 5 to 10 inches, with localized amounts of 15 inches, is forecast across the Texas Gulf Coast and East Texas late Sunday through the middle of next week, the National Hurricane Center said. It\u2019s expected to produce flash and urban flooding. Rip currents will cause life-threatening beach conditions through the weekend across much of the Gulf Coast. \u2022 At least nine dead due to Beryl: Beryl became the earliest Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic on record earlier this week. The storm killed at least nine people in the Caribbean, including two in Jamaica, three in Venezuela, three in Grenada and one person in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. \u2022 Beryl worsened by climate change: The\u00a0abnormally warm ocean waters\u00a0fueling Beryl\u2019s intensification show this hurricane season will be far from normal. Beryl\u2019s blow to Jamaica was worsened by climate change,\u00a0a new rapid attribution analysis from ClimaMeter found. Modern storms like Beryl tracking close to Jamaica are capable of unloading 30% more rain and 10% stronger winds compared to the similar storms from 1979 to 2001 because of human-caused climate change, the study found. \u2022 How to help those affected: Jamaican residents are assessing the damage after Beryl pounded the Caribbean island with destructive winds and storm surge. The storm killed two people in the country and left hundreds of thousands of homes without power. Beryl was the strongest storm to impact the country in more than 15 years. Beryl also caused major damage\u00a0across the region, including in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Barbados and Grenada. Several charities are\u00a0actively distributing aid\u00a0throughout the region. Contribute to relief efforts here. Texas officials ask coastal residents to be prepared to leave Texas officials are urging residents to prepare before Beryl\u2019s expected hit to coastal areas later this weekend. \u201cEveryone along the coast should be paying attention to this storm,\u201d Lt. Gov. Patrick said during a briefing on Friday. Already, several counties have asked residents to evacuate due to the potentially dangerous conditions Beryl could bring. Gov. Greg Abbott has also issued severe weather disaster declarations for 40 counties, as the state contends with \u201cheavy rainfall, flooding conditions, and strong tropical wind.\u201d Matagorda County issued a voluntary evacuation order ahead of Beryl\u2019s arrival, the county\u2019s Emergency Operation Center said on social media. The order calls for people to voluntarily evacuate coastal areas in the county, including Sargent, Matagorda and Palacios. Aransas County issued an evacuation order for residents of \u201clow-lying areas and flood-prone areas and persons with special needs requirements\u201d at 6 p.m. local time. There are no emergency shelter facilities in the county, according to the county\u2019s Facebook announcement, and \u201cmedical and emergency services will likely be affected by the effects of the predicted landfall of Hurricane Beryl.\u201d The City of Port Aransas, on Mustang Island,\u00a0issued\u00a0a mandatory visitor evacuation by noon Sunday, which does not include residents and property owners, according to the city. In Kleberg\u00a0County, Judge Rudy Madrid issued a \u201cVoluntary Evacuation for Baffin Bay, Loyola Beach and all low lying areas,\u201d according to a social media post from the city of Kingsville. Nueces\u00a0County\u00a0Judge Connie Scott asked citizens on the coast in low-lying areas or who need assistance to evacuate due to the possibility of the storm making landfall in the\u00a0area\u00a0as a hurricane, the county posted on social media. The National Weather Service in Corpus Christi is warning residents, \u201cnow would be the time to prepare\u201d for Beryl as its track forecast is trending farther north along the Texas coast. \u201cResidents should really be aware that the earliest \u2026 arrival of the tropical storm force winds is predicted for Sunday afternoon,\u201d Mayor Paulette Guajardo said on Friday. The mayor declared a local state of disaster Saturday afternoon, taking effect immediately. Guajardo asked those visiting the city for the Fourth of July weekend to \u201cplease consider returning at an earlier time if it\u2019s what you feel you need to do.\u201d In Houston, the weather service is likewise asking people to stay vigilant. \u201cAt this time, the main impacts for SE TX will remain increased rainfall (Mon/Tues) and the potential for tropical storm force winds (34kts) as early as Sun morning. Stay tuned and stay informed,\u201d the weather service\u00a0posted on X. The city of Rockport issued voluntary evacuation orders for residents in low-lying areas and local officials are in touch with the state to place their residents on the registry for evacuations if necessary, police spokesperson Lee Brown told CNN on Saturday. While no local hurricane shelter had been established in the area, charter buses will be ready to evacuate residents at the Aransas County Airport on Saturday evening, Brown said. Rockport, 30 miles northeast of Corpus Christi, suffered major damage\u00a0from Hurricane Harvey in 2017. Voluntary evacuations have been announced for some low-lying areas in Port Lavaca, northeast of Rockport. City spokesperson Tania French said about 1,000 people, mostly in beach areas, may be affected.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/06/weather/hurricane-beryl-south-texas-coast-weekend-sunday-monday/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "world"}}

The Vatican said in a statement that the prelate had refused to \u201crecognize and submit\u201d to the authority of the pope, and had rejected \u201ccommunion\u201d with members of the Catholic Church and its authoritative teachings. In 2018, Vigan\u00f2 released a bombshell dossier calling on Francis to resign and\u00a0accusing the pope of knowing about allegations of abuse\u00a0of trainee priests carried out by the former cardinal of Washington, DC, Theodore McCarrick, and failing to act.\u00a0A Vatican inquiry later challenged Vigan\u00f2\u2019s account\u00a0and cleared Francis. As a Vatican diplomat, the archbishop was tasked with serving the pope, which makes his excommunication for schism highly unusual. The ruling means the archbishop cannot receive the sacraments of the Roman Catholic Church, such as communion. The Vatican explained Friday that Vigan\u00f2 was excommunicated following an \u201cextrajudicial penal process,\u201d although the archbishop has said he did not \u201crecognize the legitimacy\u201d of the process. Recently, the archbishop has said Francis\u2019 election to the papacy should be considered \u201cnull and void\u201d and has instead accused the pope of \u201cheresy and schism.\u201d He has accused the pontiff of supporting what he called the \u201cclimate fraud\u201d and has criticized him for backing Covid-19 vaccines and for promoting an\u00a0\u201cinclusive, immigrationist, eco-sustainable, and gay-friendly\u201d church. Vigan\u00f2 was also at the center of controversy for arranging a meeting between the pope and Kim Davis, a Kentucky clerk who refused to issue marriage licences to same-sex couples, during the pope\u2019s 2015 visit to the US. The Vatican later said the meeting \u201cshould not be considered a form of support of her position.\u201d Following Vigan\u00f2\u2019s 2018 call for the pope to resign, several bishops in the US issued statements of support for the archbishop, which were\u00a0criticized by some commentators. For some, the archbishop had been seen as an effective diplomat and official in years gone by. \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened,\u201d Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Holy See\u2019s Secretary of State, said recently about the now-excommunicated archbishop.

{"id": "2024_07_06_sport_england-switzerland-quarterfinal-euro-2024-spt-intl", "text": "England reached its second successive European Championship semifinal after a 5-3 penalty shootout victory over Switzerland at Euro 2024 on Saturday after the quarterfinal had ended 1-1. Trent Alexander-Arnold scored the decisive penalty to seal the win for England as it booked its spot in the final four having lost in the final at the last edition of the tournament. Breel Embolo had opened the scoring when he tapped home from close range in the 75th minute in Dusseldorf, only for Bukayo Saka to equalize just five minutes later with a stunning left-footed effort. Nothing could separate the two teams in extra-time and so the game went to penalties. Switzerland\u2019s first penalty from Manuel Akanji was saved by Jordan Pickford and that miss proved pivotal as England\u2019s players dispatched their attempts with aplomb. England hasn\u2019t got the greatest track record in penalty shootouts in major tournaments, including at the Euros three years ago where Gareth Southgate\u2019s team lost to Italy in the final on penalties, but Saturday\u2019s success is a further step towards banishing those demons. Prince William was at the D\u00fcsseldorf Arena to watch England\u2019s victory. England will face the Netherlands in the semifinals, after the Oranje beat Turkey 2-1 later on Saturday in Berlin. \u201cIt is what we have practiced,\u201d Alexander-Arnold, who came on as a substitute during extra-time, told the BBC. \u201cWhen the gaffer said I was taking one, I enjoy it and I practice it \u2013 I knew I had to just execute it. All five penalties from us were great.\u201d England entered Saturday\u2019s game with question marks around its performances at Euro 2024, having flattered to deceive offensively and being saved by some late heroics from Jude Bellingham in the last-16 round against Slovakia. The first half was played in an open fashion, with Bellingham asserting his influence, while Switzerland captain Granit Xhaka \u2013 coming off a superb season for his club team, Bayer Leverkusen \u2013 continued his excellent form at the tournament in playing a vital cog in his team\u2019s possession-based game. England grew into the first half as two of it young stars \u2013 Saka and Kobbie Mainoo \u2013 almost combined on the brink of halftime, only for Xhaka to appear out of nowhere to get in a crucial block. Whatever Switzerland manager Murat Yakin told his players at the interval seemed to make an impact as his players turned up the pressure on the England defense. That pressure told when some intricate passing released Dan Ndoye down the right and his cross was turned home by Embolo to give Switzerland a deserved lead. Going behind prompted Southgate to make changes from his bench, but it was one of the starters who drew England level. Saka, who had looked England\u2019s liveliest player throughout the game, cut inside from the right wing before unleashing a powerful effort which clipped off the far post and into the back of the net. It was England\u2019s first shot on target. In the first few minutes of extra-time, Yann Sommer produced a stunning save to deny Declan Rice whose long-range effort was heading into the bottom corner before the Swiss keeper\u2019s outstretched hand pushed the ball away for a corner.. With penalties looming, Switzerland nearly got a dramatic late winner through Xherdan Shaqiri \u2013 who spent much of his club career in England with Stoke City and Liverpool \u2013 when his corner took Pickford by surprise and looked to be heading in, only for it to cannon off the bar. After Cole Palmer scored England\u2019s first effort in the penalty shootout, Akanji had his effort saved by Pickford. England\u2019s other penalties from Saka, Ivan Toney, Bellingham and Alexander-Arnold gave Sommer no chance of saving them. Southgate himself has first-hand experience of missing a crucial penalty in a semifinal defeat by Germany at Euro 1996, but England\u2019s current crop of players showed no sign of the weight of history resting on their shoulders to book the team\u2019s spot in the semifinals.

{"id": "2024_07_04_europe_labours-landslide-victory-is-a-personal-triumph-for-keir-starmer-intl", "text": "The Labour Party\u2019s resounding victory in the UK general election marks a historic moment in modern British political history and a huge personal triumph for Keir Starmer, the Labour leader who will become the country\u2019s next prime minister. Starmer\u2019s victory, with a three-figure majority in parliament, is all the more remarkable considering the journey that Labour has been on since the last general election in 2019. Then, the party suffered its worst loss in a generation under former leader Jeremy Corbyn, who stood on a hard-left platform. A path back to credibility and even being competitive in a general election looked potentially a decade off, as the Conservatives emerged triumphant from the carnage of Brexit under the charismatic leadership of Boris Johnson. Johnson not only defeated his political rivals, but completely upended the norms of British politics. Under his leadership, his party won seats in traditional working-class Labour areas once deemed out of reach to Conservatives. For a year at least,\u00a0he seemed untouchable. It was in this context that Starmer took control of a broken Labour Party on April 4, 2020. On that day, David Lammy, one of his Labour colleagues, took him to one side and warned Starmer: \u201cSet yourself a 10-year cycle. You might just lose the next election, and then you can go again.\u201d According to Lammy, Starmer smiled and said \u201cNo, I can do this in five.\u201d Even Starmer could not have predicted what would happen between the end of 2021 and Thursday night. The Conservatives succumbed to repeated self-inflicted wounds, beginning with the \u201cpartygate\u201d scandal, when Downing Street staff held illegal gatherings while the rest of the country was under strict Covid-19 pandemic lockdowns. Johnson would cling to power until the summer of 2022 despite what seemed like daily calls to resign. His successor Liz Truss would propose unfunded tax cuts that threw the economy into turmoil and forced her to resign after just 49 days in power. Rishi Sunak would replace her at the end of 2022, but by that point, most in the Conservative Party had accepted it was over. During that time, Starmer stood his ground and dragged Labour firmly into the center ground of British politics with moderate policies designed not to spook Conservative voters. Critics within his party say that he has not offered an exciting enough program for government. They fear that Starmer\u2019s moderate policies of fiscal responsibility and mild manners won\u2019t enthuse voters and that five years from now, at the time of the next election, he could fall foul of a right-wing populist surge. Their fears might not be unfounded: one of the main sub-plots of the night was the surge of the populist right-wing Reform UK, led by the only Brexiteer more famous than Johnson and noted friend of Donald Trump, Nigel Farage. There has for months been a working assumption that a Starmer victory would be in part thanks to a general disdain for the Conservatives after 14 years in power. Farage\u2019s return to frontline politics during the election campaign meant that the right-wing vote would split further, helping Starmer come through the middle in key seats and secure an even more comfortable majority. In other words, Starmer\u2019s victory might not immediately mean public support for him personally or any great enthusiasm for Labour\u2019s legislative agenda. That could become a problem once he gets his feet under the desk. It has been clear for a long time that the public wanted change more than anything else. For all these reasons, it is reasonable to say that this win is not without its caveats. The populist threat is real, the Conservative Party is far from crushed and Labour\u2019s majority is not as large as some polls had predicted in the days before the election. Starmer will not be worrying too much about this for now. He is heading for a parliamentary majority so large that he will be able to push through his agenda with ease, and he will have the full mechanics of the state to help him govern. It is a level of power that seemed out of reach for any Labour leader, least of all a boring lawyer, not so long ago. And after 14 years in the wilderness, that will be enough for many in Labour for now.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/europe/labours-landslide-victory-is-a-personal-triumph-for-keir-starmer-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_03_tech_google-ai-greenhouse-gas-emissions-environmental-impact", "text": "As Google has rushed to incorporate artificial intelligence into its core products \u2014 with sometimes less-than-stellar results \u2014 a problem has been brewing behind the scenes: the systems needed to power its AI tools have vastly increased the company\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. AI systems need lots of computers to make them work. The data centers needed to run them, essentially warehouses full of powerful computing equipment, suck up tons of energy to process data and manage the heat all of those computers produce. The end result has been that Google\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions have soared 48% since 2019, according to the tech giant\u2019s annual environment report. The tech giant blamed that growth mainly on \u201cincreased data center energy consumption and supply chain emissions.\u201d Now, Google is calling its goal to reach net-zero emissions by 2030 \u201cextremely ambitious,\u201d and said the pledge is likely to be affected by \u201cthe uncertainty around the future environmental impact of AI, which is complex and difficult to predict.\u201d In other words: a sustainability push by the company \u2014 which once included the slogan \u201cdon\u2019t be evil\u201d in its code of conduct \u2014 has gotten more complicated thanks to AI. Google, like other tech rivals, has gone all-in on investing in AI, which is widely seen as the next major tech revolution that\u2019s poised to change how we live, work and consume information. The company has integrated its Gemini generative AI technology into some of its core products, including Search and Google Assistant, and CEO Sundar Pichai has called Google an \u201cAI-first company.\u201d But AI comes with a major downside: the power-hungry data centers that Google and other Big Tech rivals are currently spending tens of billions of dollars each quarter to expand in order to fuel their AI ambitions. Illustrating just how much more demanding AI models are than traditional computing systems, the International Energy Agency estimates that a Google search query requires 0.3 watt-hours of electricity on average, while a ChatGPT request typically consumes about 2.9 watt-hours. An October\u00a0study\u00a0from Dutch researcher Alex de Vries estimated that the \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d suggests Google\u2019s AI systems could eventually consume as much electricity as the country of Ireland each year, assuming a full-scale adoption of AI in their current hardware and software. \u201cAs we further integrate AI into our products, reducing emissions may be challenging due to increasing energy demands from the greater intensity of AI compute, and the emissions associated with the expected increases in our technical infrastructure investment,\u201d Google said in its report, published Monday. It added that data center electricity consumption is currently growing faster than it can bring carbon-free electricity sources online. Google said it expects its total greenhouse gas emissions to continue to rise before falling, as the company seeks to invest in clean energy sources, such as wind and geothermal energy, to power its data centers. The large amounts of water used as coolant needed to prevent data centers from overheating also presents a sustainability challenge. Google says it aims to replenish 120% of the freshwater it consumes in its offices and data centers by 2030; last year, it replenished just 18% of that water, although the amount was up sharply from 6% the year prior. Google is also among companies experimenting with ways to use AI to fight climate change. A 2019 Google DeepMind project, for example, trained an AI model on weather forecasts and historical wind turbine data to predict the availability of wind power, helping to increase the value of the renewable energy source for wind farmers. The company has also used AI to suggest more fuel-efficient routes to drivers using Google Maps. \u201cWe know that scaling AI and using it to accelerate climate action is just as crucial as addressing the environmental impact associated with it,\u201d Google said in the report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/tech/google-ai-greenhouse-gas-emissions-environmental-impact/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_07_05_uk_labour-gaza-israel-vote-uk-election-gbr-intl", "text": "Despite Labour\u2019s landslide win in the UK general election, the party lost several seats after a strong showing from pro-Palestinian independent candidates, in a sign of anger towards Keir Starmer over Labour\u2019s position on Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. Five independent candidates who have been vocal in their support for Gaza won parliamentary seats, while a surge in votes for independents elsewhere denied Labour a victory in areas they were expected to win, leaving a small dent in its otherwise huge majority but raising questions about its foreign policy positions. In Leicester South, a seat in an industrial city in the English Midlands, Labour shadow cabinet member Jonathan Ashworth lost his seat by 979 votes to Shockat Adam, an independent candidate who made his support for Gaza a key part of his electoral pledge to voters. \u201cThis is for Gaza,\u201d Adam declared in his victory speech. Ashworth\u2019s defeat comes as a huge shock. At the last general election, when Labour slumped to its worst defeat since 1935 under the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn, Ashworth still won the seat with a huge majority, receiving 67% of the vote. In Islington North, Corbyn was reelected to the seat he has held since 1983 \u2013 but this time as an independent, rather than for Labour. Corbyn, who was Labour leader between 2015 and 2020, was expelled from the party after the UK\u2019s human rights watchdog found Labour to be responsible for \u201cunlawful\u201d acts of harassment and discrimination under his leadership, when complaints of antisemitism proliferated. Corbyn won 49.2% of the vote, while the Labour candidate came in second with 34.4%. Corbyn said the voters of Islington North were \u201clooking for a government that on the world stage will search for peace, not war, and not allow the terrible conditions to go on that are happening in Gaza at the present time.\u201d In Blackburn, Labour incumbent Kate Hollern \u2013 who won a majority of 18,304 at the 2019 general election \u2013 lost by just 132 votes to independent candidate Adnan Hussain. In Dewsbury and Batley, the independent Iqbal Mohamed also defeated Labour incumbent Heather Iqbal. And in Birmingham Perry Barr, independent Ayoub Khan defeated Labour incumbent Khalid Mahmood by 507 votes. Meanwhile, in Chingford and Woodford Green, a constituency in east London, the left-wing vote was split between Labour and Faiza Shaheen \u2013 a candidate who stood as an independent after being ousted by Labour during the campaign \u2013 allowing the Conservative incumbent Iain Duncan Smith to retain his seat by about 5,000 votes. \u201cOur vote was a combination of those appalled by how I was treated, those who took issue with having an imposed candidate who didn\u2019t know us, those who were never going to vote Labour after Starmer\u2019s stance on Gaza, and those that have never voted before,\u201d Shaheen wrote on X after the result. \u201cLabour split the vote the moment they deselected me.\u201d Anger over Labour\u2019s Gaza position Labour had feared that it could lose votes over Gaza since Starmer drew criticism in some quarters over comments made last year, shortly after Hamas launched its October 7 attack on Israel and Israel\u2019s subsequent assault on Gaza. Speaking to UK radio station LBC in October, Starmer \u2013 a former human rights lawyer \u2013 said Israel \u201chas the right\u201d to withhold power and water from Palestinian civilians in Gaza, but added: \u201cObviously, everything should be done within international law.\u201d The comment caused outrage among many left-wing and Muslim voters, leading to furious protests outside the constituency offices of several Labour Members of Parliament (MPs) and complaints of harassment. The anger was compounded after the party refused to back a Scottish National Party (SNP) motion calling for an immediate ceasefire in Israel and Gaza. Labour did, however, pass its own similar motion shortly afterwards. Many of these seats where Labour appears to have lost votes over its position on Gaza have sizable Muslim populations. According to the 2021 census, the populations of Leicester, Birmingham, Ilford and Blackburn are all more than 20% Muslim. Labour lawmakers cling on Wes Streeting, Labour\u2019s shadow health secretary set to play a leading role in Starmer\u2019s next government, clung onto his seat in Ilford North by just 528 votes, ahead of the independent candidate Leanne Mohamad in second. On a visit to the constituency before the election, CNN spoke to Mohamad while she was door-knocking in search of votes. She said, after Streeting abstained from a vote on a Gaza ceasefire, she decided to enter politics and abdicate from Labour. \u201cAs a Palestinian, that place is no longer for me\u2026 The Labour party does not represent us,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cMy family were expelled and forced out of Palestine in 1948. My grandparents never thought they\u2019d see something worse than that.\u201d \u201cAll they wanted was their politician to vote for a ceasefire. No to killing, no to more violence. No to more bombs, and they couldn\u2019t even bring themselves to do that,\u201d she said. Meanwhile Jess Phillips, also a prominent Labour figure, won her Birmingham Yardley seat by just 693 votes. Her closest opponent, Jody McIntyre, stood not as an independent but for the Workers Party of Britain, a fringe party that \u201cmakes no apology for our support for Palestine and the people of Gaza.\u201d As her victory speech was met with loud boos and chants of \u201cShame\u201d and \u201cFree Palestine,\u201d a visibly angry Phillips described the harassment she and her staff had faced during the campaign. \u201cThis election has been the worst election I have ever stood in. Today, a brilliant community activist who puts on events for every single part of our community, came out to campaign with me, and people filmed her on the street and then slashed her tires,\u201d Phillips said. Phillips broke party rank in November by voting for the SNP motion calling for an \u201cimmediate ceasefire\u201d in Gaza, but she has continued to face abuse \u2013 like many female candidates, she said. \u201cThe women in this election campaign have fared considerably worse than any of the men in our city with regard to the threat and aggression,\u201d Phillips later told ITV.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/uk/labour-gaza-israel-vote-uk-election-gbr-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "world"}}

The AI-generated\u00a0video\u00a0features a non-existent employee of the Bugatti dealership in Paris claiming Olena Zelenska purchased its new model, the Bugatti Tourbillon, for 4.5 million euros (around $4.8 million) on June 7. The clip has several markings of a deep fake, from cuts in the video, to the strange accent and lip-and-mouth movements, according to Cl\u00e9ment Briens, a researcher at cybersecurity company Recorded Future. Yet, it gathered some 18 million views in 24 hours on X, where it was reposted by pro-Russian influencers. Bugatti said in a statement on Tuesday that its dealership in Paris, operated by Autofficina Parigi, a Car Lovers Group company, was victim of several criminal offenses and \u201cfirmly denounced this disinformation campaign.\u201d \u201cA supposed salesman claiming to belong to the Car Lovers Group and its sports label Schumacher Group, published a video on social networks in which he indicated that the Bugatti Paris dealership sold a vehicle to the Ukrainian presidential couple,\u201d it said, adding that the group \u201cstrongly denies both the existence of the transaction and, consequently, the existence of the invoice.\u201d \u201cThe mandatory legal details don\u2019t appear on the invoice, the price of the vehicle is also wrong, the price of the options and their descriptions are inaccurate and inconsistent, the graphics are outdated, and the Car Lovers Group would never have allowed such a document to be issued,\u201d the statement added. The group also said it has taken legal action \u201cby filing a criminal complaint for forgery, use of forgeries, usurpation of identity and defamation\u201d \u2013 but did not specify against whom the complaint was filed. Clarity, an AI cybersecurity startup that is fighting against deepfakes, told CNN that their review of the video indicated \u201ca high certainty for AI manipulations, mostly around the middle of the face area.\u201d The video originates from a French-language website, Verite Cachee France (sic), whose content appears to be AI-generated by scraping French media. A CNN analysis shows Verite Cachee was set up recently, on June 22, 2024, and some of its pages still have prompts with AI to create fake articles at the top of the piece. CNN is not able to find a contact for the website. The website\u2019s title also doesn\u2019t use accents \u2013 the proper spelling would be V\u00e9rit\u00e9 Cach\u00e9e \u2013 casting further doubts on its authenticity. Darren Linvill, a professor at Clemson University\u2019s Media Forensics Hub, told CNN the deep fake and Verite Cachee\u2019s websites bear the hallmarks of a Russian narrative laundering campaign that has been going on since last August, with the aim of undermining Ukraine. \u201cThey typically place some video with a story to tell on YouTube. They then tell that story by layering it on the fake news pages they\u2019ve created, and often also one or more allied web pages. They then integrate the story through social media, starting with real pro-Russian influencers who are part of their network,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cOnly minor change with this campaign is that the video doesn\u2019t seem to be on YouTube.\u201d In a\u00a0report\u00a0from last December, Linvill and Patrick Warren, also a professor at Clemson, showed how the disinformation campaign was led by DC Weekly, a website that published a series of AI-generated Russian propaganda and fake stories, such as the debunked claim that Olena Zelenska bought $1.1 million jewellery at Cartier in New York last September. A report by Recorded Future, a leading cybersecurity company, also identified Veritee Cachee as being part of the same disinformation network. Given the size and resources of the network, it is likely some Russian support or financing is happening, Cl\u00e9ment Briens, a senior threat intelligence analyst at the company, told CNN. \u201cThey scrape articles automatically from a number of sources, using LLMs to introduce specifically political bias to attack Zelensky, Biden and NATO. Then they upload the articles to launder a pro-Russian narrative,\u201d Briens said. The sheer volume of articles makes it harder to detect when deep fakes are introduced because when someone clicks on the website, they see a backlog of articles that usually pass the initial check, he said. \u201cThen after someone uploads the video from YouTube or directly into the site, the amplification system gets activated on social media.\u201d The target is political readers in Europe, with the purpose to erode domestic political support for Ukraine and undermine European leaders that support Ukraine, such as French President Emmanuel Macron, according to the analyst.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/europe/deepfake-video-zelensky-wife-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "world"}}

Unlike some other countries, such as the United States, when a new British prime minister comes to power, the transition into both the new role and home happens almost immediately. That means, not only will Keir Starmer, leader of the Labour Party, be settling into his home down the road from the Houses of Parliament, but so will his wife, Victoria, and their two teenage children. So, who is Victoria Starmer, and what do we know about the new occupants of 10 Downing Street? Starmer\u2019s wife, whom he usually refers to as Vic, kept a relatively low profile during the election campaign. Both lawyers by training, they married in 2007 \u2013 the year before Starmer became Director of Public Prosecutions. Their relationship grew out of an unlikely first meeting at work, as the Labour leader told Piers Morgan in 2021. Then a barrister, he was preparing for a court case and demanded to speak to the lawyer who had drawn up documents relating to the case. That was Victoria. He asked if they were accurate, and once the conversation was over, he heard her say, \u201cWho the bleep does he think he is?\u201d before hanging up on him. He told Morgan he pursued her for months after that, and they have been together ever since. \u201cVic is beautiful, she is grounded, we share values and we laugh together,\u201d Starmer said. Victoria, whose parents are Jewish, now works in occupational health in the NHS. \u201cHalf of the family are Jewish, they\u2019re either here or in Israel,\u201d he told The Guardian last month, adding that he and his wife are \u201cvery keen\u201d for their children to understand their heritage. Meanwhile, the prime minister has spoken about his children\u2019s concerns about the house move. \u201cDeep down they\u2019re worried that this (their lives) could change, which is why we will fiercely protect their privacy.\u201d So determined is Starmer, that he refers to them in interviews as \u201cmy boy\u201d and \u201cmy girl.\u201d \u201cFrom the very start we took the decision that we would keep them as protected as we possibly can, so we won\u2019t have any photo shoots with the children and we don\u2019t name them in public,\u201d he told British broadcaster ITV\u2019s \u201cThis Morning\u201d show.

The Starmers\u2019 main hopes, he told \u201cThis Morning,\u201d were for their children to be \u201chappy and confident.\u201d That might be helped by a new addition, he admitted, as a move to Downing Street is likely to see his children \u201cramp up\u2026 their campaign for a dog.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/uk/victoria-starmer-profile-gbr-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "world"}}

The Israeli military\u2019s Civil Administration department, which manages civilian matters in the West Bank, issued the declaration\u00a0on June\u00a025\u00a0converting the area into state land, according to a\u00a0document\u00a0from the body, but the official notice wasn\u2019t\u00a0posted\u00a0until Wednesday, Peace Now said. The declaration covers a 1,270 hectare (3,138 acre) section of the Jordan Valley in the eastern West Bank near Jericho, the document from the Civil Administration shows. Peace Now, an Israeli rights group\u00a0that\u00a0monitors illegal Israeli settlement expansion, criticized the move in a\u00a0statement\u00a0on Wednesday, saying that the\u00a0seizure\u00a0makes it\u00a0even more\u00a0difficult to establish \u201ca Palestinian state alongside Israel.\u201d The group also noted that the latest declaration followed several previous announcements\u00a0that\u00a0have made this year the biggest, by far, for Israeli land seizures in the Palestinian territory,\u00a0according to data it has collected that dates back to 1993. According to the report, declaring land as state property is one of Israel\u2019s primary methods for asserting control over the occupied territories. Once land is designated as state land, Israel no longer recognizes it as privately owned by Palestinians. CNN has reached out to the spokesperson for Israel\u2019s Civil Administration for comment about this specific claim by Peace Now, but has yet to hear back. \u2018Thwarting\u2019 Palestinian statehood Separately,\u00a0on Monday Israel\u2019s Higher Planning Council, the government body responsible for greenlighting new housing construction in parts of the West Bank, said it would move to approve thousands of new housing units in dozens of Israeli settlements,\u00a0according\u00a0to Peace Now. Israel\u2019s Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who also holds a position in the Defense Ministry with significant control over civilian matters in the occupied West Bank, celebrated the move in a Wednesday\u00a0post\u00a0on X. \u201cBuilding the good country and thwarting the establishment of a Palestinian state. MTA is meeting this morning to approve over 5,000 housing units,\u201d he wrote, using an acronym for The Higher Planning Council. Smotrich spoke about preventing the occupied West Bank from becoming a part of an independent Palestinian state, according to\u00a0leaked audio\u00a0of a speech he gave in June.

The organization, founded by 2011 CNN Hero Yuval Roth, had grown to 1,300 volunteers and was helping about 140 patients a day before the war. On October 7, during Hamas\u2019 brutal attacks on Israel, several of the group\u2019s volunteers were killed. Others were taken hostage. Today, Road to Recovery\u2019s work continues, and Roth feels that it is as crucial as ever. \u201cWe \u2026 believe that patient transportation has far greater value than just humanitarian assistance,\u201d Roth said. \u201cIt is an opportunity for us to show our Palestinian neighbors a different face than what they know in their reality. It is a chance for encounters that break down barriers and stigmas.\u201d On October 8, volunteers were waiting at checkpoints at the West Bank to pick up Palestinian patients and their families. The organization currently transports between 40 to 50 patients a day between the checkpoints and Israeli hospitals and medical providers. Roth started this work in 2006 as a way to cope with personal tragedy. In 1993, his brother Udi was kidnapped and killed by members of Hamas. After his loss, Roth channeled his anger into peace. The organization says it has since provided transportation to more than 50,000 sick Palestinians. \u201cEach trip is an opportunity to make a \u2018small hour of peace.\u2019\u201d Roth said. \u201cEspecially now, just to show compassion and love. \u2026 This is the medicine for the hostility and for the hateness.\u201d Sometimes, the Israeli volunteer drivers and Palestinian passengers are able to communicate in Arabic, Hebrew, or English. When there\u2019s no shared spoken language, they communicate through gestures, which Roth finds to be more powerful than words. \u201cIf we really want one day normal life for us and for the Palestinians, we should make effort to achieve it,\u201d Roth said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just that you sit and you wait that something will happen. You have to do something. In the Bible, there is a phrase \u2026 that you ask for peace, and you have to run after the peace in order that it will happen.

Marine\u00a0Le\u00a0Pen,\u00a0figurehead of the French far-right National Rally (RN) party, vowed a prime minister from her party would prevent Kyiv using French-supplied long-range weapons to strike inside Russia and would stymie French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s suggestion\u00a0he might\u00a0put French boots on Ukrainian soil. \u201cIf Emmanuel Macron wants to send troops to Ukraine and the prime minister is against it, then there are no troops sent to Ukraine,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cThe prime minister has the final say.\u201d Marine\u00a0Le\u00a0Pen\u00a0gave a wide-ranging interview to CNN\u2019s Christiane Amanpour on Thursday ahead of the second-round vote in France\u2019s snap\u00a0parliamentary election, called\u00a0by Macron\u00a0after\u00a0National Rally\u2019s stunning European election results in May. She tore into the national soccer side\u2019s star striker,\u00a0Kylian Mbapp\u00e9,\u00a0refused to\u00a0commit to\u00a0immediately throwing\u00a0out racist candidates in her party and signalled a\u00a0stark\u00a0shift\u00a0in\u00a0France\u2019s level of\u00a0support for Ukraine, if elected. Presenting\u00a0herself firmly as\u00a0in the French political mainstream,\u00a0three-time unsuccessful presidential candidate Le\u00a0Pen\u00a0struck a confident, combative figure, days away from perhaps the greatest political victory of her career. With polls pointing towards the National Rally holding the biggest share of\u00a0the 577\u00a0seats in the National Assembly come\u00a0Monday morning,\u00a0although potentially not achieving\u00a0an\u00a0absolute majority,\u00a0Macron will likely offer them the chance to choose the country\u2019s next prime minister.\u00a0Le Pen\u2019s youthful disciple and party leader Jordan Bardella has previously said he will only accept the premiership if National Rally wins by a large enough margin. Even without an RN prime minister, any legislative action in the French parliament will have to navigate around a far-right center of gravity. If there is an RN\u00a0premiership, it would\u00a0set up a tense \u201ccohabitation\u201d with Macron\u2019s centrist presidency, especially over centerpiece policies like French support for Ukraine\u2019s war against Russia. Beyond\u00a0blocking\u00a0potential\u00a0troop deployments to Ukraine \u2013 mooted by Macron\u00a0as a way to boost\u00a0military\u00a0instructors\u2019 efficiency \u2013\u00a0Le Pen\u00a0told CNN that Kyiv\u2019s permission to use French-supplied long-range missiles inside Russia would also be rescinded. Macron was one of the first\u00a0leaders publicly to allow Ukraine to strike targets inside Russia with Western weapons, setting the stage for Washington to do the same. This has allowed\u00a0Kyiv\u00a0to target Russian military bases, formations and artillery\u00a0used to launch attacks\u00a0into Ukraine. Aside from troop deployments, Le Pen said her only \u201cred line\u201d on Ukraine was stopping France becoming a \u201cco-belligerent\u201d in the conflict via the use of long-range French missiles against targets on Russian soil. Most Western leaders currently do not consider that such supplies constitute co-belligerence with Ukraine. Le Pen: Mbapp\u00e9\u00a0not representative Le Pen directed\u00a0most of her ire closer to home. Speaking from her party\u2019s seat in Paris,\u00a0Le\u00a0Pen\u00a0lashed out at French soccer star\u00a0Mbapp\u00e9,\u00a0who has made\u00a0repeated comments in recent weeks seemingly haranguing the far right. Undoubtedly the brightest star of French football today, he joined a host of celebrities\u00a0this week\u00a0in calling on voters\u00a0to mobilize\u00a0to keep the far-right from power. \u201cThere\u2019s an emergency. We can\u2019t\u00a0leave our country in the hands of these people,\u201d\u00a0Mbapp\u00e9\u00a0said\u00a0Thursday, following National Rally\u2019s strong first-round showing. \u201cIt\u2019s really urgent. I think that we\u2019ve seen the results, it\u2019s catastrophic.\u201d Speaking last month, earlier\u00a0in the Euros\u00a02024 soccer tournament in Germany, the striker,\u00a0whose family originally come from Algeria and Cameroon, stressed that he didn\u2019t want to \u201crepresent\u00a0a country\u201d that\u00a0didn\u2019t embody his \u201cvalues.\u201d Le Pen rejected his comments, dismissing him as unrepresentative. \u201cFrench people are fed up of being\u00a0lectured and advised on how to vote,\u201d\u00a0Le\u00a0Pen\u00a0told CNN. \u201cMbapp\u00e9\u00a0doesn\u2019t represent French people with an immigration background, because there are far more of them living on the minimum wage, who can\u2019t afford housing and can\u2019t afford heating, than people like Mr. Mbapp\u00e9,\u201d she said. Accusations of racism If National Rally wins big enough\u00a0in Sunday\u2019s election,\u00a0Le\u00a0Pen\u00a0can expect to\u00a0see her loyal lieutenant\u00a0Bardella installed as France\u2019s prime minister. She will have unquestionably succeeded in bringing her party into the political mainstream. Having won nearly a third of French votes cast in the European\u00a0Parliament\u00a0elections\u00a0in May,\u00a0Le\u00a0Pen\u00a0refused to be labelled as a \u201cfar-right\u201d politician, which she said carries a stigma. \u201cIt does not correspond to what we are. And not at all to what the far right is in the United States,\u201d she\u00a0claimed. Le\u00a0Pen\u2019s party currently supports ending the automatic right to citizenship for people born to foreign parents in France\u00a0and\u00a0severely restricting citizenship by naturalization.\u00a0Additionally, the party proposes restricting the rights of foreigners to access some social services, including housing, with preferential access given to French nationals. The\u00a0second\u00a0pledge\u00a0listed in National Rally\u2019s manifesto\u00a0is a law targeting Islamist ideologies, although it does not elaborate on how. Le\u00a0Pen\u00a0fended off accusations of racism\u00a0made\u00a0against some of the hundreds of candidates her party fielded for the election. \u201cI think that in any political movement, there can be what we call \u2018black sheep,\u2019\u201d she said. One candidate, Florent de Kersauson,\u00a0reposted\u00a0a promotional picture showing a mixed-race child as \u201cfalse Brittany,\u201d another, Daniel Grenon, reportedly said North Africans have no place in \u201chigh places\u201d in France during a recorded local debate, according to CNN affiliate BFMTV. Grenon has claimed this was an \u201cerroneous\u201d quotation. \u201cI\u2019m not contesting the existence of these comments,\u201d\u00a0Le\u00a0Pen\u00a0said, referring to the accusations\u00a0levelled against her candidates. She promised to see\u00a0complaints\u00a0tackled internally by the party\u2019s conflicts commission\u00a0but\u00a0refused to have such candidates removed\u00a0immediately\u00a0from the ballot. \u201cThat\u2019s not my vision of justice,\u201d she said. Ties with Russia Cohabiting with the staunchly pro-European Emmanuel Macron will have its complications for the keenly anti-Brussels National Rally. Top of the list of sensitivities is likely to be foreign policy, where\u00a0Le\u00a0Pen\u00a0and Macron rarely see eye to eye. A far-right government\u00a0would\u00a0be welcome news for Russian President Vladimir Putin though. Le\u00a0Pen\u00a0has landed in hot water in the past over Russia. She\u2019s boasted of her admiration for Putin, refused to condemn Putin\u2019s illegal annexation of Crimea\u00a0in 2014\ufeff, and even took out a\u00a0huge loan from a Russian bank. Many held similar suspicions ahead of the election of\u00a0hard-right\u00a0culture warrior Italian Prime Minister\u00a0Giorgia\u00a0Meloni\u00a0in 2022.\u00a0But in office, she\u2019s proved a team player in Europe\u2019s support for Kyiv. There\u2019s no such absolution\u00a0yet\u00a0for\u00a0Le\u00a0Pen\u00a0though. On Wednesday, Russia\u2019s foreign ministry posted a\u00a0picture of\u00a0Le\u00a0Pen\u00a0on X, stating that French voters are seeking \u201ca break from the dictate of Washington and Brussels.\u201d Pressed on the post\u2019s relevance,\u00a0Le\u00a0Pen\u2019s answer may point to her following Meloni\u2019s hard shoulder to Moscow. \u201cIt\u2019s a form of interference, and in that sense, I find it unacceptable,\u201d\u00a0Le\u00a0Pen\u00a0said of the post. She\u2019s broken many molds already in her time in politics; the weight of real political power for National Rally may change her further still.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/europe/france-le-pen-ukraine-mbappe-intl-cmd/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_04_style_hong-kong-disneyland-dress-up-disneybound-intl-hnk", "text": "There are a lot of princesses at Hong Kong Disneyland, but not the ones you think. Instead of your Cinderellas, Elsas and Annas in their royal best, it\u2019s a fuzzy pink fox that\u2019s inspiring the princess-esque outfits of Disney-goers in their teens and 20s. LinaBell is the latest addition to a line of plush toys called \u201cDuffy and Friends,\u201d created by Disney for the Asian market. She has never made it onto the big screen, but she and her furry companions have resonated with fans in the region, becoming one of the company\u2019s best-selling franchises in the city\u2019s theme park. Young women in particular are drawing inspiration from the pastel-colored characters, creating coquettish looks. \u201cLinaBell is my favorite,\u201d said Liang Xiaoyu who was visiting from the Chinese city of Guangzhou. The 18-year-old was dressed in a pink-trimmed white frock, her hair in two loose ponytails, and was carrying a LinaBell backpack and keychain. Others spotted during a rainy June day channeled CookieAnn (a yellow dog who loves to bake), by wearing dog-ear headbands as well as ShellieMay and Duffy, the line\u2019s two bears. Dressing up is popular at Disney theme parks across the world \u2014 not just for kids, but for adults as well. Known as \u201cDisneybounding,\u201d the phenomenon sees visitors circumvent rules on wearing full Disney costumes (some masks, for instance, are banned\u00a0to avoid any confusion with the parks\u2019 own costumed employees) by using clothing and accessories that evoke their favorite characters. Qin Wuxiao, dressed from head to toe as Jessie the cowgirl doll from the \u201cToy Story\u201d franchise, was taking photos with her mother in front of the Castle of Magical Dreams. The 23-year-old student said it\u2019s become popular for young people to dress up like characters and post pictures of themselves on Chinese social media apps like Xiaohongshu. Charmy Chan and her friend Yanni Chung dressed for the day as Officer Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde from \u201cZootopia.\u201d The Hong Kong Baptist University students grew up watching Disney movies and now that they\u2019re in college they find themselves with more time to visit. \u201cWe usually come to the park once a month,\u201d said Chan, in front of the park\u2019s bakery on Main Street USA.  And at Hong Kong Disneyland, Disney characters aren\u2019t the sole fashion inspiration for dedicated fans. All around the park, there were guests like 27-year-old Li Mengru from China\u2019s Fujian province and 16-year-old Chen Xinyu from Guangdong province, dressed as Lolitas.  Not a Nabokovian Lolita, but women who dress in an unabashedly feminine style of clothing popularized in Japan in the mid-1990s. Think petticoats, dainty shoes and accessories. Li wore a light baby blue dress with statement bows and elaborate crystal nails, while Chen went with a more gothic look. Linda Lee, meanwhile, wore a bold striped black and white dress adorned with cherries and red ribbons. In the age of Instagram and TikTok, the park lends a perfect background for Disneybounders and cosplayers to immerse themselves in a fantasy world. There\u2019s the World of Frozen that opened in November last year, where influencers can be found taking photos in front of a snowflake fountain on the streets of Arendelle. Tomorrowland lends itself as a futuristic backdrop for Marvel and \u201cStar Wars\u201d fans while Toy Story Land with its outsize wooden blocks, green army men and race cars make for some playful shots. A sweet escape Since the pandemic, the city \u2013 which imposed some of the world\u2019s strictest travel restrictions \u2013 has been looking to boost tourism numbers by launching a \u201cHello Hong Kong\u201d campaign, that included giving away free flights. Though most visitors to the park are local residents, the majority government-owned Hong Kong Disneyland Resort is one of the key attractions being promoted to tourists. The Hong Kong Tourism Board\u2019s exit survey of around 93,000 people in 2023 showed the park was the third most visited attraction in the city. The shopping district of Tsim Sha Tsui and scenic spot The Peak were the two top spots respectively. Many of the non-local visitors to Hong Kong Disneyland live in mainland China or countries in Southeast Asia like the Philippines, Thailand and Singapore, with some coming from Japan and South Korea as well. Wandering into Adventureland from Grizzly Gulch, 34-year-old Kris Yang and 35-year-old Jimmy Redinger stopped to chat with CNN.\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s crazy about Disney,\u201d said Yang who is from mainland China of his partner, who is from the United States. The two primary school teachers were visiting from the northern Chinese province of Hebei. They wore shirts from \u201cZootopia\u201d and \u201cHercules\u201d and were decked out in Disney paraphernalia. \u201cIf you like my outfit today, you should have seen me yesterday,\u201d said Redinger who proudly identified himself as a \u201cDisney adult,\u201d a term that might come with some baggage in the United States, given some of the extremes fans have gone viral for. \u201cI was in a full Goofy movie get-up.\u201d \u201cI embrace the idea of a \u2018Disney adult\u2019,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s in the name. Adults who love Disney. Someone who really has that connection to the company and parks.\u201d In Asia, the penchant for child-like things as adults broadly carries less social stigma than in the West. China\u2019s \u201cmeng\u201d and Japan\u2019s \u201ckawaii\u201d cultures embrace cuteness. Many, like 37-year-old Mariko Otomo kitted out in Disney accessories, were there as a form of escape. \u201cUsually we work very hard. We go office and back, office and back,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we finally come to Disney we forget the daily stuff.\u201d \u201cEven just walking here, (I) have a good feeling,\u201d said Ankh Wong a 24-year-old saleswoman who has visited the park more than 20 times over the past six years. As soon as she got her first job, she bought a ticket to the park. \u201cIt\u2019s a place for happiness and I can put down my worries,\u201d said 16-year-old Deng Chundan. Tactics like themed staycations and special events, collaborations with brands like Le Creuset, Godiva and local jeweler Chow Tai Fook and cultivating successful franchises such as Duffy and Friends are part of the park\u2019s strategy to appeal to Gen Z and millennials. In recent years, the park has invested a reported $1.4 billion in expanding some of its attractions, which included a new \u201cFrozen\u201d themed section of the park. (\u201cFrozen,\u201d which came out in 2013, is likely one of the first Disney films Gen Z would have watched as children). Disney declined CNN\u2019s request for information on the ages of its annual visitors, but it\u2019s clear the Hong Kong park draws many grown-up fans. Redinger said nostalgia brings him back time and time again. \u201cAs the parks grow, we grow with the parks, reliving that time with our families (that) we had.\u201d ", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/style/hong-kong-disneyland-dress-up-disneybound-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "world"}}

Denim is also a prominent feature in the closing ceremony ensembles. For this occasion, Ralph Lauren designed a racecar-style jacket with USA patch detailing, a a classic striped polo and crisp white jeans. \u201cI think this collection in its entirety does a really good job of combining classic American style with a little bit more of that contemporary feel,\u201d Paralympic swimmer Jamal Hill, a bronze medal-winner at the 2020 Tokyo Games, told CNN. \u201cI\u2019m wearing this to the all-white party,\u201d he noted, with a laugh, of the closing ceremony look in particular, adding, \u201cmy only regret is that when I come home, the season for all-white will be almost over.\u201d The athletes honored as Team USA\u2019s flag bearers at the opening and closing ceremonies will receive versions of these looks in different colorways to help them stand out in the crowds. Beyond this, athletes will also receive pieces from a special, commemorative \u201cVillagewear\u201d collection. Named in reference to the Athletes\u2019 Village, the clothing line (which will be available to purchase) will feature version of classic Ralph Lauren pieces \u2014 jackets and sweaters, rugby shirts, knits, joggers, color-blocked tees and much more. In a first for the brand, this year there is also a \u201c100% recycled\u201d polo shirt in the mix. \u201cRalph Lauren has once again created designs that not only capture the essence of American style but also embody the spirit and pride of Team USA,\u201d Sarah Hirshland, CEO of the US Olympic & Paralympic Committee, said in a statement. \u201cThis iconic apparel serves as a symbol of unity and inspiration for both our team and the millions of fans who will be cheering them on.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/style/team-usa-olympic-uniforms-ralph-lauren/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "world"}}
