The country\u2019s Rohingya have long suffered mass atrocities and forced displacement that many \u2013 including UN experts \u2013 consider to be genocide, perpetrated by the country\u2019s military. Now, they are caught between warring forces in a deepening conflict that has unleashed more violence against the Muslim-majority community. Since\u00a0seizing power in a coup in February 2021, the military has been fighting a widening civil war against ethnic armed groups and people\u2019s resistance forces across Myanmar. In the western state of Rakhine, the Arakan Army, a powerful ethnic-minority armed group battling Myanmar\u2019s military junta, said it seized a predominantly Rohingya town close to the Bangladesh border. Reports from activists and relatives of residents have emerged of AA soldiers torching and looting Rohingya houses in the town of Buthidaung, preventing people from returning home, confiscating phones and threatening to kill those who try to contact family abroad. A junta-imposed internet and telecoms blackout in the state is making it almost impossible for relatives to speak with family members there and for journalists, activists and international monitoring groups to verify exactly what is unfolding. Farooq, a Rohingya poet living as a refugee in neighboring Bangladesh, told CNN that most of his family were still in Buthidaung but he has not been able to reach them since Saturday. \u201cThen, my brother-in-law told me that my family were displaced, and my home was burned down by the Arakan Army,\u201d he said. Rohingya rights activists and former officials said about 200,000 people had been forced to flee their homes to escape the fires and that many people, including women and children, had spent multiple nights hiding out in open paddy fields with no food, medicine, or belongings. There are also reports of an unconfirmed number of casualties. CNN cannot independently verify these reports. But satellite imagery showed huge fires engulfed downtown Buthidaung on Saturday morning and continued to burn over the weekend. Remote sensing data curated by NASA\u2019s Fire Information for Resource Management System and viewed by CNN suggests that the fires spread in the early hours, while satellite imagery collected by space technology company Maxar and obtained by CNN shows large-scale destruction across Buthidaung on that day. \u201cThe entire town is burning,\u201d said Nay San Lwin, a Rohingya activist originally from Buthidaung, and co-founder of the Free Rohingya Coalition. \u201cFew houses remain intact, only a few.\u201d The violence echoes attacks on the stateless Rohingya community in 2016 and 2017, when Myanmar\u2019s military launched a\u00a0brutal campaign\u00a0of killing, rape and arson that\u00a0is currently subject to a genocide investigation at the International Court of Justice. An estimated 1 million Rohingya people live now in what many consider to be the world\u2019s largest refugee camp in Bangladesh, after hundreds of thousands fled the military\u2019s \u201cclearance operations.\u201d Many of those who remained in Myanmar live in apartheid-like conditions and face heavy restrictions on their movement, education and healthcare. More than 100,000 Rohingya people\u00a0have been\u00a0kept in squalid displacement camps by the military and government in the Rakhine state capital for the past 10 years. Others have made perilous boat journeys to Indonesia, choosing to risk their lives at sea over enduring inhumane conditions at home. Young Rohingya men also face forcible conscription from the junta, the AA and armed Rohingya insurgent groups both in Myanmar and in the sprawling Bangladesh camps where gang violence is escalating. Experts with the Special Advisory Council for Myanmar on Sunday warned that the Rohingya are \u201cagain at risk of genocide\u201d and urged the UN Human Rights Council to convene a special session to address the \u201cworsening human rights emergency in Myanmar.\u201d UN rights chief Volker T\u00fcrk said\u00a0in a statement on Sunday that \u201cthis is a critical period when the risk of yet further atrocity crimes is particularly acute.\u201d Buthidaung attacks Fighting between the Arakan Army and Myanmar\u2019s military erupted in November after a shaky ceasefire broke down. The AA has made significant territorial gains in Rakhine state in recent months and last week announced that it had taken control of all junta military bases around Buthidaung, as well as the town itself. Aung Kyaw Moe, a\u00a0Rohingya\u00a0adviser to Myanmar\u2019s shadow National Unity Government \u2013 a continuation of the administration deposed in the coup \u2013 wrote on Saturday that the AA had ordered residents to leave the town in the days before the attack. \u201cTwo days before AA call elders for meeting to leave the houses as soon as possible AA will confiscate the Buthidaung downtown,\u201d he wrote on X, adding \u201cthe\u00a0Rohingya\u00a0said they will not leave because they have no where to go.\u201d In recent weeks, the population of Buthidaung had swelled as residents fled fighting in nearby villages, Rohingya activists said. Nay San Lwin from the Free Rohingya Coalition \u2013\u00a0who managed to speak with several residents of Buthidaung \u2013\u00a0said that, at 9:30 p.m. local time on May 17, AA soldiers entered the town and shortly after began torching homes. Reports also suggested that junta airstrikes and artillery\u00a0had\u00a0hit Buthidaung that day but there were no military soldiers left in the town, he said. \u201cI asked them about who are conducting the burning \u2013 they strictly said the AA members came into town and started shooting into the air and warning people to get out of their houses or you will be burned alive,\u201d he said. John Quinley, director of human rights group Fortify Rights, said there is \u201cclear destruction of civilian infrastructure including Rohingya civilian homes.\u201d \u201cWhat we have in Buthidaung over the last few days is the junta conducting artillery shelling and airstrikes\u2026 and signs pointing to the AA conducting widespread arson over the weekend,\u201d he said. AA spokesperson Khaing Thu Kha\u00a0wrote\u00a0on Telegram Friday evening that the armed group was \u201cevacuating the Muslim communities in Buthidaung and providing food, shelter, and medical care for them including the children, the women, and elderly persons.\u201d The AA has denied it torched the town, saying in a statement\u00a0on May 20 that it \u201cadheres to its principle of fighting under the military code of conduct and never targets non-military objects.\u201d It accused the Myanmar military, along with allied Rohingya militant groups \u2013 which it refers to as \u201cBengali terrorists\u201d \u2013 of destroying Buthidaung. The AA said that on May 17 the Myanmar military \u201claunched a prolonged aerial attack on Buthidaung township until midnight as their last desperate attacks.\u201d A previous statement from the AA in late April said that homes of non-Muslim people living in Buthidaung had been burned down in attacks by \u201cjunta-backed Bengali Muslim terrorist groups\u201d and \u201cother Muslim militants recently armed and trained by the junta.\u201d CNN cannot independently verify these claims. Farooq, whose family were forced to flee the fires, said it was the AA who set fire to villages and the homes of the Rohingya. There was no active fighting with the military at the time, he said. \u201cIn Buthidaung, when my (family) home and when my mom was asked to leave the village, there was no fight at all. There is no military left, no base, no junta there,\u201d he said. He said AA soldiers had warned residents there not to contact people living abroad and anyone caught with a Bangladesh SIM card \u201cwill be executed.\u201d Nay San Lwin also said he had heard reports that AA soldiers were taking cash and mobile phones from fleeing Rohingya. \u201cThey are afraid they have footage (of them) torching these houses,\u201d he said. In recent weeks, Buthidaung\u2019s residents had been subject to increasing violence by junta forces, rights groups and activists have said. Satellite imagery from Planet Labs, obtained by CNN, shows that western neighborhoods were affected by fire damage in mid-April and the Pan Zinn Chaung Bridge\u2014a crucial artery on the eastern edge of the city\u2014was destroyed prior to Friday\u2019s arson attacks. Humanitarian offices of Medecins\u00a0Sans Fronti\u00e8res in the town were burned down on April 15, the group said. \u201cWe hear reports of more than 200 homes being burned down and witness thousands of people who are displaced by the violence seeking refuge in an area directly across from where our office was located,\u201d it said at the time. Warnings of further atrocities An immediate concern is a humanitarian crisis in Rakhine state, with newly displaced residents unable to access food or clean water. \u201cThere are no NGOs at all, who will distribute food for them? The Myanmar military has blocked all access,\u201d said Nay San Lwin. \u201cAlso they are confining people to these villages. They are not allowed to leave.\u201d The violence has sparked a flurry of condemnations from human rights groups and the international community, calling for a halt in the fighting, to protect civilians, and for humanitarian aid to be allowed into Rakhine. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said the US is \u201cdeeply troubled by the reports of increased violence\u201d in Rakhine state and warned there are \u201crisks of further atrocities occurring.\u201d \u201cThe military\u2019s previous acts of genocide and other crimes against humanity targeting Rohingya, in addition to its history of stoking intercommunal tensions in Rakhine State and elsewhere across the country, underscore the grave dangers to civilians.\u201d Myanmar\u2019s National Unity Government said on Tuesday that it has \u201crepeatedly acknowledged that shameful past actions and failures in Myanmar allowed horrendous atrocities to be committed against minority communities, including the Rohingya, Rakhine and others in Rakhine state.\u201d \u201cWe are committed to ensuring that these crimes are never repeated.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/asia/myanmar-rohingya-arson-buthidaung-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_23_sport_us-lawmakers-call-chinese-doping-investigation-olympics-intl-spt", "text": "A doping case involving 23 Chinese swimmers took a diplomatic twist on Wednesday after US lawmakers called on the US Department of Justice and the International Olympic Committee to launch inquiries into the controversy. The Chinese swimmers tested positive for trimetazidine, a banned performance-enhancing substance, several months before the Tokyo Olympics \u2013 a tournament at which they were allowed to compete in, and went on to win medals at, according to a report from the New York Times released in coordination with German public broadcaster ARD. \u201cThis scandal raises serious legal, ethical, and competitive concerns and may constitute a broader state-sponsored strategy by the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) to unfairly compete at the Olympic Games in ways Russia has previously done,\u201d said US Reps. Raja Krishnamoorthi and John Moolenaar, who are the two leading members of the House Select Committee on the Strategic Competition Between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party. In a statement released Wednesday, the lawmakers called for an assessment as to whether the alleged doping was \u201cstate-sponsored,\u201d adding that could warrant further diplomatic measures by the United States and the international community. \u201cFurthermore, with less than 100 days until the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris, understanding the full scope of the scandal is critical in ensuring our U.S. athletes are competing in a fair competition,\u201d the statement added. The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) last month dismissed allegations that the case was mishandled, describing them as \u201coutrageous\u201d and \u201ccompletely false,\u201d while the China Anti-Doping Agency (CHINADA) called media reporting about the situation \u201cmisleading.\u201d WADA has since commissioned an independent review into its handling of the case. \u201cWADA continues to stand by its handling of this contamination case. The truth is it followed every process and line of inquiry when reviewing this file and determined, based on compelling scientific evidence, that these were cases of contamination, not of doping,\u201d a spokesman for WADA told CNN in an email. \u201cTo this day, no evidence has been produced that suggests otherwise,\u201d he added, noting that the organization awaits the findings of the independent enquiry.\u203a CNN has reached out to the Department of Justice and the IOC for comment. According to the European Medicines Agency (EMA), trimetazidine \u201cis a medicine used to prevent angina attacks, which are sudden pains to the chest, jaw and back brought on by physical effort, due to reduced blood flow to the heart.\u201d It has an effect on metabolism \u2013 where the body breaks down substances in order to convert them into energy. It increases the rate at which glucose is broken down, allowing it to be used to protect against myocardial ischaemia \u2013 reduced blood supply to the heart muscle \u2013 according to the EMA. The reports have sparked concern among athletes and governing bodies. The Canadian Olympic Committee called the media reports \u201cconcerning\u201d and \u201cnot previously known to us,\u201d while Sarah Hirshland, CEO of the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee, said that the organization was \u201cdeeply disheartened\u201d about allegations which challenge \u201cthe very foundation of what fair competition stands for.\u201d In a press conference last month, WADA president Witold Banka said that the agency \u201cfollowed all due processes and diligently investigated every lead and line of enquiry in this matter\u201d and found \u201cno evidence of wrongdoing \u2026 and no credible way to disprove the contamination theory that was accepted by CHINADA.\u201d A statement from CHINADA cited by Xinhua said the swimmers tested positive for an \u201cextremely low concentration\u201d of trimetazidine at a national swimming event in 2021. Trimetazidine has the potential to boost endurance and has been banned by WADA since 2014. CHINADA ultimately decided that the athletes should not be held responsible for the results after its \u201cimmediate\u201d investigation concluded that they were inadvertently exposed to the substance through contamination, Xinhua reported.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/sport/us-lawmakers-call-chinese-doping-investigation-olympics-intl-spt/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_weather_iowa-tornado-damage-storm-forecast-wednesday", "text": "The destructive tornado that ravaged the town of Greenfield, Iowa, on Tuesday has left four dead and at least 35 injured, the Iowa State Patrol said in a Wednesday evening\u00a0news release. Authorities are not releasing the names of the deceased at this time pending next of kin notifications. In addition to the fatalities reported in Greenfield, at least one person was killed as storms passed through nearby Adams County, local officials said earlier. The Iowa State Patrol said the number of those injured from the Greenfield twister \u201cis likely higher, but these numbers reflect only those patients treated for their injuries at designated alternate care sites.\u201d At least 14 patients were taken to medical facilities outside of the county, the release added. The\u00a0tornado that carved through Greenfield \u2013 about 50 miles southwest of Des Moines \u2013\u00a0was\u00a0an EF4,\u00a0the National Weather Service in Des Moines said Thursday, and\u00a0is\u00a0the deadliest of the year. The tornado had peak winds of\u00a0175 mph to\u00a0185 mph,\u00a0was\u00a0more than a half-mile\u00a0wide\u00a0and was on the ground for 44 miles,\u00a0according to the National Weather Service in Des Moines. More than 100 first responders were combing through the wreckage of the town Wednesday, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds said. The city\u2019s hospital sustained damage and some patients were moved to other facilities in surrounding areas. At least four medical airlift flights occurred. A \u201cmakeshift hospital\u201d was set up in the city\u2019s lumberyard Tuesday right after the tornado tracked out of the area, State Rep. Ray Sorensen said Wednesday. Sorensen lives in the area and assisted with recovery efforts in the immediate aftermath. \u201cWe pulled a guy from the rubble and put him on a little makeshift stretcher that we made for him on the back of a truck,\u201d Sorensen recalled. Video taken by CNN affiliate KCCI shows homes and other structures were obliterated and the community is blanketed with heaps of debris, tossed cars and uprooted trees. \u201cIt\u2019s horrific,\u201d Reynolds said Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to describe until you can actually see the devastation.\u201d At least three tornadoes were reported in Iowa on Tuesday \u2013 part of a torrent of storms that left widespread power outages, structural damage and flooding across the US this week. Tornado reports have skyrocketed well-above average in recent weeks as the typically busiest period of severe weather season unfolds. The more than 800 tornadoes reported so far make 2024 one of the most active years for twisters on record. Greenfield, home to just over 2,100 residents, must now recover from the damage of the deadliest tornado in a year that\u2019s recorded fewer deaths from twisters than 2023. Despite the number of tornadoes this year, there had been 17 deaths from the beginning of 2024 until Tuesday, while 65 people died due to tornadoes during the same period last year. Nearly 15,000 homes and businesses were in the dark across Iowa, Wisconsin and Illinois as of Thursday morning, according to PowerOutage.us. On Wednesday, a tornado hurtled through Temple, Texas \u2013 about 35 miles south of Waco \u2013 causing widespread power outages and making many roads dangerous or impassable. First responders were flooded with emergency requests and were prioritizing life-saving calls Wednesday night, the city said in a release announcing a disaster declaration. \u201cCurrently, no life-threatening injuries or fatalities have been reported,\u201d the release said. More than 125,000 homes and businesses in Texas were without power Thursday morning, including nearly 55,000 in Bell County, where Temple is located, according to PowerOutage.us. More than 200 homes destroyed in Iowa The governor expanded her disaster declaration from 15 counties to 32 on Thursday, and said state officials are working with the FEMA to get the federal declaration approved, citing \u201ca lot of destruction and damage across the state.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re going to process it as quickly as we can,\u201d said FEMA administrator Deanne Criswell. More than 200 homes were destroyed in Iowa, Reynolds said. Greenfield and other parts of western Iowa bore the brunt of the storms\u2019 catastrophic impacts: In Greenfield\u2019s county, Adair, 153 homes were either damaged or destroyed, according to Reynolds. A tornado also toppled a hulking wind turbine just south of Greenfield in Prescott, Iowa, and more than two dozen homes were damaged or destroyed in Montgomery County, including some \u201ccritical public facilities,\u201d emergency management officials said. No injuries have been reported but damage assessments are still ongoing. But Greenfield is the epicenter of Tuesday\u2019s event. \u201cThere is basically nothing left,\u201d Clel Baudler, a former Iowa state representative who lives a half mile from Greenfield, told CNN on Tuesday. Valerie Warrior, a Greenfield resident, pleaded with God to protect her home and her family before she rode out the storm in her basement, she told KCCI. \u201cI was in the furnace room and then I heard (the storm) like a train,\u201d she said, describing insulation flying off of basement windows. \u201cI heard it, and I knew it was hitting.\u201d Warrior said the scale of damage is devastating to see, but she is confident residents will pull each other through the crisis. \u201cThey\u2019ll get through it. You already see people out helping each other, working together. And that\u2019s what they do, people come together when a tragedy happens. People come together to support and encourage each other.\u201d Fighting back tears, Warrior looked out the rubble strewn across her neighborhood and tried to crack a smile. \u201cWe\u2019ll rebuild,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll rebuild.\u201d CNN\u2019s Jessica Jordan, Sara Smart, Amy Simonson, Andy Rose and Brad Parks contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/weather/iowa-tornado-damage-storm-forecast-wednesday/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_world_russia-ukraine-war-migrating-eagles-intl-scli-scn", "text": "Greater spotted eagles are already a species under threat. Now, scientists have found that they have been facing yet another danger: the war in Ukraine. Eagles have been exposed to conflict events while migrating through Ukraine, forcing them to deviate from their usual flight path, according to a study published Monday in the journal Current Biology. Listed as \u201cvulnerable\u201d by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, greater spotted eagles have been largely eradicated from western and central Europe, according to the study. However, Polesia, a large wetland region that borders Poland, Belarus, Ukraine, and Russia, remains a stronghold for the species. On March 1, 2022, a week after Russia invaded Ukraine, the first of 21 tagged greater spotted eagles crossed into Ukraine on its usual migration, according to researchers from the UK and Estonia. \u201cWhen the conflict started in February 2022, we were kind of watching things unfold on the news like everyone else, but sitting there also with the feeling that we know our birds are about to pass through that area and wondering what that might mean for them,\u201d lead study author Charlie Russell, a conservation scientist and ornithologist who is studying for his PhD at the UK\u2019s University of East Anglia, told CNN Tuesday. Using conflict data and GPS tracking, the researchers quantified the impact of the conflict on the migratory behaviour of 19 eagles who were passing though Ukraine northward to breeding grounds in southern Belarus between March and April 2022. The study authors found that the eagles diverted significantly from their usual flight path when compared to pre-conflict migrations between 2019 and 2021, with the eagles flying further and less directly to breeding grounds. While the researchers did not have direct observational evidence to determine the stimuli the birds could respond to, they thought noise and light from military activities could have affected their behavior. The deviations were found to be greater at areas where the route of migration coincided with more military activity, but it differed for each bird due to varying exposures and responses to conflict, according to the researchers. Due to greater deviations, the birds had to travel further and their migrations also took longer to complete. Females, for example, spent an average of 246 hours travelling to breeding grounds, rather than the pre-conflict time of around 193 hours, according to the study. The eagles travelled 85 kilometers (53 miles) further on average and, in an extreme case, one bird flew an extra 250 kilometers (155 miles) further compared to previous years, Russell said. Males were found to travel more slowly, averaging a speed of around 7.66 meters (25 feet) per second, rather than the pre-conflict average of around 9.75 meters (32 feet) per second. The researchers observed no difference in migration performance and deviation patterns outside of Ukraine, according to the study. Potential breeding risk The other significant finding was that the birds were making less stopovers than in previous years. Stopover sites are essential places for the eagles to get food, water, rest and refuel, and shelter from poor weather during their long journeys, according to researchers. While 18 tracked individuals \u2013 90% of the tracked eagles \u2013 made stopovers in Ukraine while migrating between 2018 and 2021, only six made stopovers in 2022. In the years before the conflict, 11 of the eagles used common stopover sites in Ukrainian Polesia, but these sites were not used at all in 2022. \u201cThe combination of these two things, having to fly forever and expend more energy, and the reduced ability to recover that energy, is something that we think will have had sublethal fitness costs, which might have carried over into the breeding period that year,\u201d Russell added. Reduced fitness and the delayed onset of breeding due to spending more time recovering from the journey could reduce breeding success, which is already relatively low in the population, as well as impact chick provisioning and the fledgling date of young birds, according to the study. \u201cI think it\u2019s very important to understand the different stresses that the environment is facing as a result of conflict so that in a post-conflict setting, we can better support not just greater spotted eagles but the wider ecosystems as well to recover,\u201d Russell said. \u201cWe know very little about the impacts of human conflicts on wildlife, particularly when it comes to migratory species, so this study plugs an important knowledge gap,\u201d professor Nathalie Pettorelli, an applied ecologist and senior research fellow at the Zoological Society of London, told CNN Tuesday. Pettorelli, who was not involved in the study, added that understanding what affects the eagles\u2019 survival is \u201ckey\u201d to ensuring they have a future. \u201cMore broadly, human conflicts are on the rise globally, stressing the need for more research on the impacts of conflicts on biodiversity and, where possible, for the development of effective mitigation policies,\u201d Pettorelli said. Ukraine accused Russia of \u201cecocide\u201d after suffering an environmental catastrophe in July due to the collapse of the Kakhovka dam in the south of the country that led to more than 100 people being killed, as well as the destruction of farmland and nature reserves. Russell said the war in Ukraine is \u201creally raising the profile of some of the environmental issues caused by conflict. And it\u2019s not just in Ukraine. This is something that\u2019ll be happening to different extents at other conflict zones as well.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/world/russia-ukraine-war-migrating-eagles-intl-scli-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "world"}}

The streams of patients, mostly children, are rising faster than we can keep up with fewer medical staff.\u201d More than 35,000 people have been killed in Israel\u2019s seven-month military offensive, most of them women and children, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. According to Hamawy, the European Hospital is \u201cthe last standing hospital that\u2019s functionating like a functional medical center.\u201d Many hospitals have been forced to evacuate and, \u201cthe ones before them have all been raided and destroyed.\u201d No medical team replaced the healthcare professionals who evacuated Tuesday, leaving the hospital with even fewer workers to look after patients with increasingly fewer resources.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/middleeast/european-hospital-gaza-medics-freed-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "world"}}

Though relations between the two sides have been steadily worsening in recent years, this latest escalation marks a significant test for Taiwan\u2019s new leader, whose ruling party has championed democracy in the face of growing threats\u00a0from its authoritarian\u00a0superpower neighbor. China\u2019s ruling Communist Party says Taiwan is part of its territory, despite never having controlled it, and has vowed to take the island, by force if necessary.\u00a0And it has become much more bellicose under Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Here\u2019s what you need to know. What\u2019s happening with the drills? The Eastern Theater Command of the Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) said it launched joint military drills involving the army, navy, air force and rocket force in areas around Taiwan early\u00a0Thursday morning. The drills are being conducted in the Taiwan Strait \u2013 a narrow body of water separating the self-ruling island with mainland China \u2013 as well as north, south and east of Taiwan. They are also taking place in areas around Taiwan\u2019s outlying islands of Kinmen, Matsu, Wuqiu and Dongyin, located just off China\u2019s southeastern coast, the command said in a statement. Naval Colonel Li Xi, spokesperson for the command, called the exercises \u201ca strong punishment for the separatist acts of Taiwan independence forces and a serious warning against interference and provocation by external forces.\u201d China\u2019s military drills are often as much about playing to a domestic audience as signaling intentions internationally. Chinese state media heavily covered Thursday\u2019s drills while the military also posted footage of one of its vessels on social media. The exercises subsequently went viral on China\u2019s heavily regulated internet. Taiwan\u2019s Defense Ministry said in a statement it had dispatched sea, air and ground forces to respond to China\u2019s drills. It expressed regret to \u201csuch irrational provocations and actions that undermine regional peace and stability.\u201d The island\u2019s presidential office said in a statement that it was \u201cconfident and capable of defending national security,\u201d accusing China of \u201cusing unilateral military provocation to threaten Taiwan\u2019s democracy and freedom.\u201d What triggered this? The most obvious answer is Lai\u2019s inauguration on Monday. Lai\u2019s Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), now in power for a historic third term, views Taiwan as a de facto sovereign nation with a distinct Taiwanese identity. Ahead of Taiwan\u2019s elections back in January, Beijing had warned that a Lai victory could inflame tensions and spark conflict \u2013 repeatedly framing the vote as a choice between \u201cpeace and war.\u201d Taiwanese voters dismissed those warnings, returning the DPP to power \u2013 although two opposition parties that favor closer ties with China now have a majority in parliament. China\u2019s government and state media regularly rebuke Lai, calling him a dangerous separatist, \u201ctroublemaker\u201d and \u201cwar maker,\u201d while rejecting his repeated offer of talks. Their vehement dislike of Lai is rooted in his political past, as well as Beijing\u2019s refusal to deal directly with a huge swathe of Taiwan\u2019s leaders. The 64-year-old former doctor and political veteran was once an open supporter of Taiwan independence \u2013 a red line for Beijing. His views have tempered over the years, and he now says he favors the current status quo, saying there is \u201cno plan or need\u201d to declare independence since the island is \u201calready an independent sovereign country.\u201d But Beijing has never forgiven him for those early comments \u2013 making its stance clear with the drills on Thursday. Lai, too, has set the tone for his new administration\u2019s approach to China \u2013 using his inaugural speech on Monday to declare that a \u201cglorious era of Taiwan\u2019s democracy has arrived,\u201d and reiterating a determination to defend its sovereignty. He also called on Beijing to cease its \u201cintimidation\u201d of Taiwan and respect that its people want to decide their own destiny. What\u2019s the relationship between China and Taiwan? The bloody Chinese Civil War ended with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) taking power in the mainland, establishing the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) in Beijing in 1949. The defeated Nationalist Party fled to Taiwan, moving the seat of their Republic of China (ROC) government from the mainland to Taipei. Both proclaimed themselves the sole rightful government of the entire Chinese territory. In recent years, Taiwan has downplayed its territorial claims over mainland China, and is today a vibrant democracy, with its own military, currency, constitution and elected government. But it is not recognized as an independent country by most governments in the world.\u00a0Over the decades it has become increasingly isolated diplomatically \u2013 with an increasing number of governments switching their diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing.\u00a0But unofficial diplomatic ties with many Western nations have in fact been bolstered in recent years, in part thanks to China\u2019s sabre-rattling. Meanwhile, under Xi, China has become increasingly assertive in foreign policy and grown more authoritarian at home. China has cut official communication with Taiwan since the the DPP took office in 2016, and has ramped up economic, military and diplomatic pressure on the island. At the same time, ties between Taipei and Washington have become more robust, with increased arms sales and high-level political engagement under Lai\u2019s popular predecessor Tsai Ing-wen. This has infuriated Beijing, spurring it to unleash more pressure on Taiwan and sending cross-strait relations on a downward spiral. Where does the US stand in this? The US formally switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979 \u2013 but has long trod a delicate middle path. In what is known as the \u201cOne China\u201d policy, Washington recognizes the People\u2019s Republic of China as the sole legitimate government of China; it also acknowledges Beijing\u2019s position that Taiwan is part of China, but has never accepted the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s claim of sovereignty over the island. The US maintains close unofficial ties with Taiwan, which have been strengthened in recent years. It is bound by law to provide the democratic island with the means to defend itself, and supplies the island with defensive weaponry. American lawmakers regularly visit Taiwan and have supported legislation to bolster US support for the island and its defensive capabilities. But it has historically remained deliberately vague on whether it would defend Taiwan in case of a Chinese invasion, a policy known as \u201cstrategic ambiguity.\u201d After the island\u2019s election in January, the US sent an bipartisan delegation to Taiwan, where they met with Lai and Tsai \u2013 and promised that American support for\u00a0Taiwan\u00a0will continue no matter who wins the upcoming US election. Beijing on Tuesday also announced sanctions against former US House Representative Mike Gallagher, who led that delegation, citing his \u201cremarks and actions\u201d that \u201cinterfere\u201d in China\u2019s internal affairs.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/asia/china-taiwan-drills-explainer-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_20_middleeast_amal-clooney-icc-arrest-warrant-israel-hamas-gaza-intl-latam", "text": "Human rights attorney Amal Clooney is among a group of legal experts who advised the International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor to seek arrest warrants against the top leaders of Israel and Hamas. The panel was convened by the ICC prosecutor Karim Khan and tasked to review the evidence and legal analysis underpinning his application for warrants against three Hamas leaders and two Israeli politicians, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. It issued a detailed legal report on Monday, which said the panel found \u201creasonable grounds to believe\u201d that the individuals named in the arrest warrants have committed war crimes or crimes against humanity. Clooney, who has represented victims of mass atrocities, faced online criticism prior to her announcement for not speaking about Israel\u2019s siege on Gaza. In a statement shared on her Clooney Foundation for Justice website on Monday, she explained how she had found herself advising Khan. \u201cMore than four months ago, the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court asked me to assist him with evaluating evidence of suspected war crimes and crimes against humanity in Israel and Gaza,\u201d the statement said. \u201cI agreed and joined a panel of international legal experts to undertake this task.\u201d She said the panel\u2019s findings were \u201cunanimous\u201d despite their diverse backgrounds. \u201cI served on this panel because I believe in the rule of law and the need to protect civilian lives. The law that protects civilians in war was developed more than 100 years ago and it applies in every country in the world regardless of the reasons for a conflict,\u201d Clooney said in the statement. The eight-person legal panel consisted of renowned legal experts, including Theodor Meron, former President of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, and Lord Justice Fulford, a former ICC judge. They \u201cunanimously determined\u201d that the court had jurisdiction over crimes committed in Palestinian territories and by Palestinian nationals, Clooney\u2019s statement wrote. The panel also was unanimous in concluding that \u201cHamas leaders Yahya Sinwar, Mohammed Deif and Ismail Haniyeh have committed war crimes and crimes against humanity, including hostage-taking, murder and crimes of sexual violence.\u201d Clooney\u2019s statement added there was also \u201creasonable grounds to believe\u201d Netanyahu and \u201cIsraeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant have committed war crimes and crimes against humanity including starvation as a method of warfare, murder, persecution and extermination.\u201d A panel of ICC judges will now consider Khan\u2019s application for the arrest warrants. Both Hamas and Israeli politicians condemned the arrest warrants, with Netanyahu calling it a \u201ctravesty of justice\u201d and an \u201coutrageous decision\u201d that \u201ccreates a twisted and false moral equivalence between the leaders of Israel and the henchmen of Hamas.\u201d The application for warrants marks the first time the ICC has targeted the top leader of a close ally of the United States. Israel and the US are not members of the ICC. However, the ICC claims to have jurisdiction over Gaza, East Jerusalem, and the West Bank after Palestinian leaders formally agreed to be bound by the court\u2019s founding principles in 2015. The Biden administration on Monday forcefully denounced the ICC\u2019s move, with President Joe Biden saying in a statement: \u201cWhatever this prosecutor might imply, there is no equivalence \u2013 none \u2013 between Israel and Hamas.\u201d Clooney, who is a barrister at Doughty Street Chambers in London and an adjunct professor at Columbia Law School, is married to the actor George Clooney. Alongside her husband, she co-founded the Clooney Foundation for Justice, which gives free legal support to victims of abuses of power, according to its website. She has represented Yazidi victims of genocide \u201cin the only three genocide cases against ISIS members in the world,\u201d according to the website. She also was counsel to victims of genocide in Sudan\u2019s Darfur and \u201chelped to secure freedom for political prisoners around the world including journalists and opposition figures.\u201d CNN\u2019s Ivana Kottasov\u00e1 contributed to this report.

{"id": "world_africa_earthranger-track-wildlife-kenya-spc", "text": "It\u2019s early morning in Sera Community Conservancy in Northern Kenya and sunlight beats down across this expansive semi-arid landscape. Birds calling and boots crunching are the only sounds for miles as a team led by Kenyan wildlife veterinarian Dr. Mukami Ruoro-Oundo carefully tracks white rhinos \u2014 the first of their kind to be found here in Samburu County. Once common in the area, by the early 1990s Northern Kenya\u2019s rhino population was decimated by poaching. But the country\u2019s black rhino population has more than doubled since 1989, and by December 2022 there were 1,900 black rhinos and white rhinos in total, according to Kenya Wildlife Services. Sera Conservancy has championed the country\u2019s community-led rhino conservation efforts. In 2015 it established East Africa\u2019s first community rhino sanctuary with the introduction of 10 critically endangered black rhinos. Today, that number has grown to 21 black rhinos which freely roam across 107 square kilometers (41 square miles) of designated sanctuary land, and in February 2024, they were joined by four white rhinos from the nearby Lewa Conservancy. As she searches on foot, Dr. Ruoro-Oundo spots two of the female white rhinos. One, called Sarah, looks heavily pregnant but as the vet creeps closer she notices something is very wrong. Mindful of not encroaching too long on the rhinos\u2019 territory and reluctant to intervene unnecessarily, she opts for a different approach; through a conservation technology tool called EarthRanger she can monitor Sarah\u2019s movements in real time from a distance.\u00a0 Prior to translocation, each of the four white rhinos was fitted with a GPS tag in its horns and ears, which sends a real-time location to remote devices like mobile phones, or to the conservancy\u2019s operations center, where Dr. Ruoro-Oundo is able to monitor Sarah\u2019s location and movements. As EarthRanger\u2019s co-founder Jake Wall tells CNN, \u201cIt\u2019s exactly like a \u2018Find my Friends\u2019 for rhino.\u201d Sparse internet connectivity means Dr. Ruoro-Oundo cannot get a clear signal from Sarah\u2019s transmitter but thankfully Sarah is not alone; a female rhino named Arot has never left her side and through Arot\u2019s transmitter Dr. Ruoro-Oundo can see that Sarah has barely moved in hours, suggesting her condition is deteriorating. By using a drone to take photos of her, the team is able to confirm that Sarah urgently needs help. \u201cWe noticed she has a fecal impaction, it was quite huge and had made the rectal and vulvar area swollen,\u201d says Dr. Ruoro-Oundo. \u201cShe\u2019s in a lot of pain because she could not put down her tail, and you could see she was a bit sluggish, she really wanted to spend her time lying down. So in such a case we really need to intervene for her comfort, to relieve her of the distress and the pain.\u201d An emergency intervention is immediately put into action, led by Kenya Wildlife Services and Sera Conservancy\u2019s management and rangers. Air, ground and additional veterinary support are mobilized within hours \u2014 potentially saving not only Sarah\u2019s life but that of her unborn calf too. For Dr. Ruoro-Oundo, the key to safeguarding Kenya\u2019s wildlife is a balance between community and technology. \u201cI think you cannot separate technology from conservation in the future,\u201d she says.\u201d The human element can never be removed, but technology will always come to assist where we cannot reach.\u201d A global effort Now used in 70 countries, EarthRanger\u2019s story started in Kenya when co-founder Wall was researching elephants there. \u201cIn about 2012, we had a real crisis with poaching in Kenya, so we wanted a way that we could pick up on elephants that were getting killed, and the sign for us was that the collar stopped moving for more than about five or six hours, which is the longest sort of period that an elephant rests for,\u201d he recalls. \u201cSo I wrote the algorithm that could work out whether an elephant had stopped moving or not, and then (the collar) would send an SMS if it had. So that was kind of the beginning.\u201d He adds that the system has evolved quite significantly since then, and Sarah is one of 9,000 animals \u2014 including elephants, lions, giraffe, tortoises, sea turtles and 1,200 rhinos \u2014 that EarthRanger is currently tracking in Kenya alone. Wall says the system can integrate data from more than 100 different devices \u2014 \u201canything from elephant trackers to ear tags for rhino, to collars for lions, tail tags (for giraffes), devices that glue onto the shell of a turtle.\u201d It can also receive information from sources such as vehicle trackers, satellites, and remote sensing alerts for things like deforestation and fire. \u201cIt\u2019s pulling it all into one platform, where it can be readily visualized, analyzed and then acted upon,\u201d Wall adds. \u201cAnd all of that\u2019s giving the operators and managers a bird\u2019s eye view of the situation as it\u2019s happening, with real-time tools.\u201d According to the EarthRanger, all of these devices are designed to be lightweight, durable and inconspicuous ensuring they don\u2019t impact on the animals\u2019 natural behavior or cause them discomfort. For rhinos, Dr. Ruoro-Oundo says that attaching a tracker is the equivalent sensation of a human getting their ears pierced. Samuel Lekimaroro, a wildlife protection manager for the Northern Rangelands Trust, which includes Sera Conservancy, uses this kind of data to live-track terrestrial and marine wildlife across 6.5 million hectares. For Lekimaroro it has become a powerful tool in translocating wildlife, data collection and security operations, including identifying hotspots for human-wildlife conflict. \u201cThanks to EarthRanger, trophy poaching has been on a steady decline for the last five years, from a high of 120 elephants poached in 2012, to zero in the last four years in (our) member conservancies,\u201d he says. Wall says its potential to securely collect and share data from different EarthRanger sites from across the world is revolutionary. \u201cIf organizations are doing, say, joint patrolling, or monitoring of a species, then they can also share that information,\u201d he says. \u201cBy storing information on EarthRanger we can pull that data from different sites and combine it in ways that was never possible before. So it\u2019s really enabling the analysis and the reporting in a way that just never existed before.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/world/africa/earthranger-track-wildlife-kenya-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "world"}}

Zelensky said Chinese leader Xi Jinping assured him in a phone call that Beijing supports Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity \u2013\u00a0though he did not say when the exchange happened. He was speaking in an interview with news agency AFP aired on Friday, shortly after Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s two-day visit to China, during which the two countries pledged deeper strategic cooperation. Beijing has never condemned Russia\u2019s February 2022 invasion, instead claiming neutrality in the conflict, having released a vaguely articulated 12-point position on its resolution. Ahead of expected peace talks in Switzerland next month, Xi has\u00a0called for negotiations that take both sides\u2019 positions into account. Engaging global players like China is crucial because \u201cthey have influence on Russia, and the more such countries we have on our side\u2026 the more Russia will have to move and [more countries] to reckon with,\u201d Zelensky said. Noting the assurances he says Xi gave him over the phone about territorial integrity, he added: \u201cThey support, but what they will do, we are yet to see.\u201d The only known phone\u00a0call between Zelensky and the Chinese leader was in April last year. Zelensky said he would like to see China at the international talks in Switzerland next month,\u00a0aimed at paving the way for a peace process in Ukraine. The summit has drawn delegations from more than 50 countries so far, Reuters reported on Thursday, citing Swiss President Viola Amherd. China has not committed to the event, though its ambassador to Switzerland Wang Shihting said\u00a0in March that Beijing was considering participating. Russia has not been represented at any of the four rounds of closed-door international peace talks that have taken place so far, and will not be at this one. China has attended one, hosted by its increasingly close strategic partner Saudi Arabia. During a recent six-day trip to Europe, Xi pushed back against allegations that his country has been supporting Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, saying China \u201coppose[s] using the Ukraine crisis to shed responsibility or defame a third country and provoke a new Cold War.\u201d But he joined French President Emmanuel Macron in calling for a global Olympic truce, which would see a pause in fighting in all conflicts during the upcoming Summer Games in Paris. Zelensky, however, expressed skepticism about the ceasefire proposal, citing inadequate guarantees against Russian advances. \u201cEven if we imagine that there is some kind of Olympic truce for two weeks and everyone is standing still, tell me, I told Emmanuel, who can guarantee that Russia will not use this time to bring its forces to our territory,\u201d Zelensky told AFP. \u201cThere is a risk that while we are not fighting them back and not stopping them with artillery fire, even (in the areas) where they are advancing, there is a risk of them bringing more heavy military equipment to our territory.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/18/europe/zelensky-china-ukraine-peace-talks-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_17_europe_vatican-guidance-supernatural-phenomena-scli-intl", "text": "The Vatican has tightened up its guidance on recognizing supernatural phenomena such as apparitions of the Virgin Mary and seemingly blood-soaked crucifixes. The new guidelines replace rules drawn up in 1978 and say that bishops should no longer act independently over such sightings but instead consult the Vatican. The changes made by the Vatican\u2019s doctrinal office (DDF) aim to to bring the church up to date in responding to the swift spread of claims of apparitions online. According to the document released by the Vatican Friday, the new procedure will allow for \u201cfaster decisions while respecting popular devotion\u201d when it comes to assessing claims of supernatural phenomena, which could include the appearance of stigmata and other purported miracles. Under the previous guidelines, a local bishop could rapidly declare a phenomenon\u2019s supernatural nature, the Vatican said, \u201conly for the Holy Office to express a different decision later.\u201d In other instances a bishop might decide whether or not an occurrence was supernatural only for his successor to conclude the opposite, the statement continued. The new Vatican guidelines say \u201cas a rule\u201d bishops and church officials will not declare whether alleged phenomena are supernatural or not, leaving this decision to the Pope. The head of the DDF, Cardinal Victor Manuel Fernandez, told reporters that often these events \u201chave led to a great richness of spiritual fruits, growth in faith, devotion, fraternity, and service. In some cases, they have given rise to shrines throughout the world that are at the heart of many people\u2019s popular piety today.\u201d Speaking at a Vatican press conference, the cardinal cited Lourdes, the Marian shrine in the southwest of France visited by those with physical and spiritual ailments, as a positive example. However, he went on to add that some alleged events which derive from the pursuit of \u201cprofit, power, fame, social recognition, or other personal interest\u201d may harm the faithful, potentially even to the extent of \u201cexerting control over people or carrying out abuses.\u201d Bishops will now generally be expected to issue a \u201cnihil obstat\u201d which will allow for worship but will leave open the issue of formal recognition of \u201csupernatural\u201d activity to the Vatican. However, Fernandez said that this recognition would be \u201cvery exceptional\u201d. Other options available to the bishops include the option to formally reject an experience as supernatural, as well as steps to ban or limit worship of phenomena regarded with suspicion. The guidelines state that those spreading false claims can face sanctions, including formal church penalties. Positive criteria that will be considered by the Church when making a conclusion include the credibility and reputation of those reporting the occurrence, while negative criteria include possible errors, overt pursuit of personal interest, and \u201cany psychosis (or) collective hysteria.\u201d One site of alleged Marian apparitions still under review by the Vatican is Medjugorje, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, with Cardinal Fernandez telling reporters the claims would be studied according to the new norms.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/europe/vatican-guidance-supernatural-phenomena-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "world"}}

It aims to honor the \u201cstrength and dignity\u201d of the princess, according to a statement from the publication sent to CNN Thursday.

Do they have a recurrent gesture?,\u201d she said in the statement. Uzor also revealed that Kate\u2019s recent video announcing a cancer diagnosis informed the work. \u201cAll my portraits are made up of layers of a personality, constructed from everything I can find about them,\u201d she said in the statement. However, not everybody appreciated the portrayal of the princess. \u201cThis is dreadful - somehow, I\u2019m not sure the artist is a fan of the Princess - it looks like a bad GCSE project,\u201d reads one comment under a post from Tatler on X. \u201cThis looks nothing like the Princess of Wales. It\u2019s so awful, it\u2019s disrespectful,\u201d reads another. \u201cI agree with the sentiments of strength and dignity but the portrait lacks any resemblance to the Princess of Wales,\u201d said another. However, some did praise the work, with one calling the painting \u201cbeautiful.\u201d \u201cAm I the only person who likes this? It\u2019s art, not a photo,\u201d wrote another commenter. And it wasn\u2019t just social media users who reacted to the painting. Alastair Sooke, chief art critic at UK newspaper The Daily Telegraph, said in an article that the painting was \u201cintolerably bad\u201d and \u201cshows no flicker of resemblance to its subject.\u201d \u201cHas there been a flatter, more lifeless royal portrait in living memory?\u201d Sooke wrote. \u201cBeneath a Lego-like helmet of unmodulated, monotonously brown \u2018hair,\u2019 this Princess of Wales has as much charisma as a naff figurine atop a wedding cake.\u201d Kate Mansey, royal editor at The Times of London, was also non-plus. \u201cI\u2019m not quite sure what to say about this one, except, hmm\u2026\u201d she wrote on X. The backlash follows a similar discussion surrounding the first official portrait of King Charles III since his coronation, which was revealed earlier this month. The 8.5 by 6.5-foot painting by British artist Jonathan Yeo depicts the monarch wearing the uniform of the Welsh Guards, sword in hand, against a fiery red background that appears to almost swallow him whole, as a butterfly looks like it\u2019s about to land on his shoulder. While the King is reportedly happy with the portrait, others criticized the lurid red brushstrokes, with one person likening it to a \u201cposter for a horror film.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/style/catherine-princess-wales-tatler-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "world"}}

Duke Kahanamoku Beach on the island of Oahu crowns the list of the 10 best US beaches put out annually by \u201cDr. Beach,\u201d aka coastal scientist Stephen Leatherman. Kahanamoku is no fluke pick, either. It was the No. 2 beach in Leatherman\u2019s 2023 list. What makes it such a favorite? The sandy haven \u201cis located at the west end of Waikiki Beach, far from the large crowds elsewhere,\u201d Leatherman said in a Thursday news release. \u201cIt is the widest beach on this stretch of world-famous sands and protected by an offshore coral reef, making it a good beach for families with children.\u00a0 The nearby Duke Kahanamoku Lagoon is also a favorite bathing and swimming spot,\u201d said Leatherman, a professor in the Department of Earth & Environment at Florida International University in Miami. Hawaii is king in 2024 The 50th state has the most entries on the top 10, sporting a total of three slots on the coveted list. So if you\u2019re willing to island hop in Hawaii, you can score a top 10 beach trifecta in one state. Like many beautiful places around the world, Hawaii is grappling with how to handle crowds and sometimes unruly tourists, like the ones who trespassed at the Haiku Stairs on Oahu even as they were being dismantled. Go Hawaii, the state\u2019s tourism website, has a webpage devoted to tips on how to respect the islands\u2019 culture and environment. Elsewhere, New York and Florida have two beaches each on the list. And then South Carolina, Massachusetts and California landed one spot each to finish filling out the top 10. Leatherman has been evaluating beaches and producing the annual list since 1991.\u00a0 He uses 50 criteria to grade the beaches, which include water and sand quality, the size of waves, the shape of the beach, wildlife, public safety and cleanliness. If Hawaii isn\u2019t on your travel calendar, the No. 2 beach is in the highly populated Northeast. Coopers Beach, located on Long Island, New York, is \u201cshielded from the cold Labrador currents in the beautiful village of Southampton. The beach is backed by large sand dunes covered by American beach grass interspersed with extravagant mansions,\u201d Leatherman said in the release. Coopers was the No. 3 beach in 2023. The No. 6 beach in the United States is also located on Long Island. As for the Sunshine State\u2019s two entries, both beaches are on the Gulf coast, edging out its Atlantic-facing beaches.

{"id": "2024_05_22_world_full-flower-moon-may-2024-scn", "text": "Stargazers are in for a treat this week: The full moon returns for its May engagement, peaking on Thursday morning. May\u2019s full moon is known as the flower moon, a reference to its appearance in late spring, when many flowering plants begin to bloom again after their winter slumber. The glowing orb will reach maximum illumination on Thursday at 9:53 a.m. ET, according to NASA. The best time to view the moon, though, is at night on Wednesday and Thursday, since it will be below the horizon during its peak in some regions, according to the Farmer\u2019s Almanac. The flower moon will begin to rise after sunset on Wednesday, reaching its highest point after midnight, per EarthSky. In some parts of the world, including the Washington, DC area, the full moon will come so close to the bright star Antares on Thursday night that the star will appear to vanish behind the moon, according to NASA. The flower moon name is thought to have originated among the Algonquin people who live in Canada and parts of the northeastern United States, according to the Farmer\u2019s Almanac.  But ancient groups coined several creative names for May\u2019s full moon that mark the arrival of warmer weather and the new life that grows during the spring. Its old English name is \u201cmilk moon,\u201d according to NASA, a reference to the archaic English word for the month we now call May. The eighth-century monk St. Bede the Venerable referred to May as the month of three milkings \u2013\u2013 in the medieval era, people believed that cows could be milked at least three times daily in late spring. Other names for May\u2019s full moon include \u201cfrog moon,\u201d from the Cree people of Canada\u2019s North Plains \u2014 likely a nod to the spring peeper frog and its birdlike chirp, which is a harbinger of warm weather. The Dakota and Lakota people of the US Great Plains also called the celestial spectacle the \u201cplanting moon\u201d to mark the agricultural practice of planting in the spring for a healthy harvest. The flower moon played a minor role in a particularly dark period of US history. Martin Scorsese\u2019s recent Oscar-nominated historical drama \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon\u201d explores a series of murders of Osage people in Oklahoma. The killings began in May 1921, the month of the flower moon. Remaining moons of 2024 Of the 12 full moons this year, the September and October lunar events will be considered supermoons, according to EarthSky. Definitions of a supermoon can vary, but the term generally denotes a full moon that is closer to Earth than normal and thus appears larger and brighter in the night sky. Some astronomers say the phenomenon occurs when the moon is within 90% of perigee \u2014 its closest approach to Earth in orbit. Here are the remaining full moons of the year: June 21: Strawberry moon July 21: Buck moon August 19: Sturgeon moon September 17: Harvest moon October 17: Hunter\u2019s moon November 15: Beaver moon December 15: Cold moon", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/world/full-flower-moon-may-2024-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_uk_uk-early-elections-sunak-conservatives-intl", "text": "UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced a snap general election for July\u00a04 in a statement outside Downing Street on Wednesday evening, as his Conservative Party faces an uphill struggle to extend its 14 years in power. Sunak said\u00a0outside Downing Street\u00a0that he had informed King Charles III of the rare summer poll, firing the starting gun on a\u00a0six-week\u00a0campaign that is almost universally expected to conclude in the demise of his Conservative government. Soaked by a downpour as he spoke, Sunak said: \u201cNow is the moment for Britain to choose its future.\u201d He also attacked his opponents, saying that by voting for the Labour Party, Britain would \u201crisk going back to square one.\u201d But he admitted: \u201cI cannot and will not claim that we have got everything right.\u201d Sunak was required to hold a vote by January 2025, and had long resisted calls to be specific about his plans. But a fall in inflation rates, announced earlier Wednesday, provided the backdrop for his announcement. The move\u00a0will be welcomed by the buoyant Labour Party, led by Keir Starmer, which is soaring in the opinion polls and has sought to present itself as a reformed and moderate group that is ready for power. In the wake of the announcement, Buckingham Palace said the British royal family would postpone engagements \u201cwhich may appear to divert attention or distract from the election campaign.\u201d The King and Queen\u2019s D-Day memorial engagements in June are expected to go ahead as scheduled. In his speech, Sunak sought to paint external factors such as Covid-19 and the war in Ukraine as the context to Britain\u2019s economic struggles, saying the two factors combined represented \u201cthe most challenging times since the Second World War.\u201d But he battled heavy rain that soaked his suit in just minutes, and he was almost drowned out by a loudspeaker outside the Downing Street gates, through which a protester blared D:Ream\u2019s \u201cThings Can Only Get Better,\u201d the theme song of Labour\u2019s big election win in 1997. Starmer was quick to respond to Sunak\u2019s announcement. Speaking at an indoor news conference, the opposition leader said: \u201cTonight the prime minister has finally announced the next general election.\u201d He framed the vote as a \u201cchance to change for the better \u2013 your future, your community, your country.\u201d \u201cIt will feel like a long campaign, I\u2019m sure of that, but no matter what else is said and done, that opportunity for change is what this election is about,\u201d he said. Current polling is dire for Sunak; Labour begins the campaign around 20 points up on average, with the Tories often closer to third-party challengers such as Reform and the Liberal Democrats than they are to Labour. When converted to a projection of seats in parliament, those figures indicate either a comfortable Labour win or a potential electoral wipeout for the Conservatives. Sunak will hope that a shrewd campaign could result in a spectacular upset for Labour and extend a period of Tory rule which began in 2010 and has overseen austerity economics, Brexit, the Covid pandemic and a cost of living crisis. He is the fifth Tory leader to serve during that time, taking over from the ill-fated Liz Truss, whose disastrous term imploded just six weeks after it began and exacerbated the financial woes crippling the United Kingdom. Sunak\u2019s party will likely put his efforts to tackle illegal migration at the center of his campaign; a recent move to deport some asylum seekers to Rwanda finally became law last month, and the first flights could potentially leave during the campaign. But Labour will seek to highlight the government\u2019s struggles to ease soaring prices, the state of Britain\u2019s over-stretched healthcare service, and the sleaze scandals that have tanked the Tories\u2019 reputation among a large swath of British voters. Smaller parties could upend the designs of the two dominant groups, even if it is virtually impossible for them to return a government. The new, anti-migration Reform Party and the centrist Liberal Democrats will look to challenge Sunak in some of his party\u2019s historical strongholds, complicating his efforts to hold power. North of the border, the pro-independence Scottish National Party will hope to hold off a Labour challenge and regain its dominance in Scotland\u2019s politics despite a rocky period and the recent ascension of its third leader in 15 months. The Conservatives under former Prime Minister Boris Johnson won a healthy majority in the last UK-wide vote, in December 2019, pledging to push through Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union \u2013 an issue that had transfixed politics in the country for more than three years. But Johnson\u2019s premiership collapsed after a string of scandals, paving the way for his then-finance minister Sunak to emerge as a frontrunner for the leadership. Adding to the sense that the Conservatives are nearing the end of their time in power, dozens of Tory MPs \u2014 including former cabinet ministers and ex-Prime Minister Theresa May \u2014 announced they would not seek re-election. But recent election and referendum campaigns have proved volatile, and Tories still publicly hopeful of success have pointed to mixed levels of enthusiasm for Labour\u2019s offering. The vote will take place on\u00a0Thursday July 4\u00a0in all of the UK\u2019s 650 parliamentary constituencies,\u00a0and counting will occur overnight, with the two main parties seeking to cross the 326 mark needed for a majority. A government will be formed as soon as that mark is crossed, and take charge immediately, pending the symbolic approval of King Charles III.

{"id": "2024_05_22_tech_fcc-weighs-ai-rules-political-ads", "text": "The Federal Communications Commission is taking initial steps toward new rules that could require political ads on TV and radio to include disclaimers about the use of artificial intelligence. On Wednesday, FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel called on other agency commissioners to support such regulations amid growing fears that AI-generated deepfakes could disrupt elections. \u201cAs artificial intelligence tools become more accessible, the Commission wants to make sure consumers are fully informed when the technology is used,\u201d Rosenworcel said in a news release.\u00a0\u201cToday, I\u2019ve shared with my colleagues a proposal that makes clear consumers have a right to know when AI tools are being used in the political ads they see, and I hope they swiftly act on this issue.\u201d Wednesday\u2019s proposal aims to open a rulemaking process at the FCC that would likely take months to play out. The proposal calls for new rules governing broadcast TV and radio, as well as cable and satellite providers. Under the proposed rules, political advertisers on those mediums would have to make on-air disclosures if their ads contain AI-generated content. The FCC does not regulate internet-based media such as streaming video services or social media. As part of the proposed rule, political advertisers would also have to provide written disclosures in the files that broadcasters are\u00a0required to make available\u00a0to the public. The FCC move seeks to fill\u00a0a yawning gap\u00a0in the regulation of artificial intelligence in political advertising. Existing US election law prohibits campaigns from \u201cfraudulently misrepresenting other candidates or political parties,\u201d but whether this prohibition extends to AI-generated content is an open question. Last summer,\u00a0Republicans on the Federal Election Commission blocked\u00a0a move that could have made clear the law extended to AI-created depictions; the FEC has since agreed to revive the discussion, but it has not reached a decision on the matter. In the meantime, some US lawmakers have proposed legislation that could clamp down on AI in elections. In March, a bipartisan proposal by Minnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski unveiled the\u00a0AI Transparency in Elections Act, which could require AI disclaimers on political ads. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York, has stressed the urgent need for Congress to create guardrails for artificial intelligence, particularly for elections. Last week, he and a bipartisan group of senators\u00a0released a blueprint\u00a0for legislative action. But many\u00a0policy analysts doubt\u00a0that Congress can pass meaningful AI legislation during an election year. Online platforms such as Meta have taken their own steps to address AI in political ads,\u00a0requiring campaigns\u00a0to disclose the use of deepfakes and banning the use of its\u00a0in-house generative AI tools\u00a0for political advertising.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/tech/fcc-weighs-ai-rules-political-ads/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "world"}}

The company was responding to a civil lawsuit filed against American Airlines claiming the girl, listed as Mary Doe, was \u201csecretly filmed while using the airplane toilet\u201d during an American Airlines flight in January 2023. A former American Airlines flight attendant, Estes Carter Thompson, 37,\u00a0who\u00a0federal investigators say secretly recorded several minors\u00a0while they used the bathroom on different American Airlines flights last year, is also named in the lawsuit filed in Texas. The former employee is facing federal child sexual exploitation charges. The incident involving the 9-year-old occurred during a flight from Austin, Texas, to Los Angeles, California, the lawsuit states. In a filing Monday, American Airlines initially argued that the girl was at fault and negligent because she used a lavatory \u201cshe knew or should have known contained a visible and illuminated recording device.\u201d In response to CNN\u2019s request for comment on the filing, American Airlines said the filing was made in error by outside counsel retained by the airline\u2019s insurance company. \u201cThe included defense is not representative of our airline, and we have directed it be amended this morning,\u201d American Airlines said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cWe do not believe this child is at fault and we take the allegations involving a former team member very seriously.\u201d The airline\u2019s amended response filed Wednesday in Travis County district court removes the defense that Mary Doe was at fault for being filmed in the plane\u2019s bathroom. Defenses by American Airlines\u2019 lawyers stating that their conduct did not contribute to the alleged injuries were also removed along with language that claims the airline is \u201cnot liable to Plaintiff because it had no legal duty to disclose any of the information not disclosed.\u201d Attorney Paul Llewellyn, who is representing the girl and her family, said he believes American Airlines\u2019 change in direction was in response to public backlash. \u201cTo claim that they filed the \u2018wrong\u2019\u00a0answer is simply not credible, but the bell cannot be unwrung [sic],\u201d\u00a0Llewellyn told CNN in a statement Wednesday. \u201cThey should never have taken such an outrageous position in the first place.\u201d Llewellyn called American Airlines\u2019 legal strategy \u201cdepraved\u201d and \u201cshocking.\u201d \u201cInstead of taking responsibility for this awful event, American Airlines is actually blaming our daughter for being filmed,\u201d the child\u2019s mother said in a statement. \u201cHow in good conscience could they even make such a suggestion?\u201d Ex-flight attendant had videos of several minors, DOJ says Last month, Thompson was indicted in Massachusetts on federal charges including sexual exploitation of children and possession of child pornography in connection to an incident involving a 14-year-old on an American Airlines flight bound for Boston, according to the criminal complaint. While investigating that incident, federal prosecutors in Massachusetts say they uncovered additional videos on\u00a0Thompson\u2019s iCloud account that show four additional minors \u2013 including a 9-year-old \u2013 using the bathroom on American Airlines flights between January and August 2023, according to the Department of Justice. Parents of the 14-year-old, who is being referred to as Jane Doe, also filed a complaint against American Airlines in North Carolina after she was filmed using the airplane toilet during a flight from Charlotte, North Carolina. \u201cAmerican Airlines\u2019 conduct immediately following the incident, including not immediately confiscating the flight attendant\u2019s phone and not immediately notifying the pilots, allowed the flight attendant to destroy evidence, and exacerbated the harm suffered by Plaintiff,\u201d the complaint said. According to the complaint, Jane Doe has suffered significant emotional distress and damages as a result of the airlines\u2019 conduct and now seeks relief. CNN reached out to attorneys for Jane Doe for comment.

{"id": "2024_05_21_europe_depardieu-paparazzi-harrys-bar-rome-intl-latam", "text": "In a scene reminiscent of La Dolce Vita era, French actor Gerard Depardieu has been accused of attacking celebrity photographer Rino Barillari outside Harry\u2019s Bar on the famed Via Veneto in Rome. Depardieu was dining at an outdoor table with a female companion and two other people around 2 p.m. local time on Tuesday when Barillari \u2013 known as \u201cthe king\u201d in Roman press circles \u2013 apparently snapped the diners, according to Italian media reports. Exactly what happened next is a matter of dispute, though both sides say they have filed police reports known locally as denouncements. Barillari, age 79, said Depardieu\u2019s partner Magda Vavrusova jumped up and started punching him before Depardieu joined the fight, according to Barillari\u2019s lawyer, as cited in several Italian media outlets including the Messaggero newspaper where Barillari works. Police confirmed to CNN that \u201ca local photographer\u201d had filed a complaint around an incident at Harry\u2019s Bar on Tuesday, but did not divulge the names of those involved. Piero Lepore, the owner of Harry\u2019s Bar in Rome, confirmed to CNN that the incident happened, but did not cast blame. Barillari often captures celebrities dining at the establishment, which is famous for appearing in the 1960 Federico Fellini film \u201cLa Dolce Vita\u201d \u2013 whose photographer character Paparazzo is reputed to have inspired the term \u201cpaparazzi.\u201d \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen fisticuffs here in two decades. This sort of thing never happens here,\u201d Lepore told CNN by telephone. \u201cWe are used to celebrities and we are used to paparazzi \u2013 they can\u2019t survive without each other. But we are no longer used to these fights.\u201d When asked for details, he said that because there was now a denouncement by Barillari, he could not comment. \u201cI gave my testimony to the police. I can\u2019t say any more.\u201d Barillari was taken to hospital by ambulance, according to Lepore. Magda Vavrusova\u2019s lawyer, Delphine Meillet,\u00a0said in a statement to CNN that it was Barillari who had pushed Vavrusova. Meillet told the Adnkronos news agency that Vavrusova filed a denouncement with Rome police stating: \u201cThe photographer pushed me, touching my torso and chest with his arm. At this moment in which I present the complaint I still feel pain, it was very violent.\u201d Meillet told the news agency that Vavrusova was also in the hospital, though calls to the University Policlinico Umberto did not confirm her as a patient. Meillet also told the news outlet that in fact Depardieu had run to intervene after the photographer attacked his companion and \u201cslipped and fell on him.\u201d CNN has also reached out to Depardieu\u2019s lawyer for comment. A spokesperson for Rome police said they are currently looking for surveillance footage from the area. Barillari got his start as a celebrity paparazzi when he was just 16 years old by delivering photos he had taken of celebrities at the Trevi Fountain to various news outlets, according to his biography. He has been to the emergency room 200 times after being attacked by his subjects, he said in a documentary to mark his 70th birthday nine years ago. He went on to become Rome\u2019s most infamous paparazzi, publishing several books of his images which have included popes, presidents and stars like Sylvester Stallone, Sharon Stone, Liz Taylor and Frank Sinatra, according to his bio. He has suffered 82 broken cameras, 11 broken ribs and a broken femur after photographing a local celebrity allegedly beating up his girlfriend in Piazza Navona, where he lives and keeps a photo studio.

{"id": "2013_05_30_weather_hurricane-season-fast-facts", "text": "Here\u2019s a look at the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to November 30.  Facts The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) defines a hurricane as \u201can intense tropical weather system with well-defined circulation and sustained winds of 74 mph (64 knots) or higher.\u201d In the western North Pacific Ocean, hurricanes are called typhoons while similar storms in the Indian Ocean and South Pacific Ocean are called cyclones.  The peak of the Atlantic season is from mid-August to late October. Hurricanes are rated according to intensity on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  The 1-5 scale estimates potential property damage due to maximum sustained wind speed.  A Category 3 or higher is considered a major hurricane.   A hurricane watch indicates the possibility that a region could experience hurricane conditions within 48 hours.  A hurricane warning indicates that tropical-storm-force winds of at least 74 mph are expected within 36 hours.  Hurricane Development There are four stages of development: tropical disturbance, tropical depression, tropical storm and hurricane (tropical cyclone). Tropical disturbance: Cloud columns develop into a cluster of thunderstorms.  Tropical depression: Thunderstorms intensify, with maximum sustained winds of 38 mph or less.  Tropical storm: Maximum sustained winds are between 39-73 mph. During this time, the storm becomes more circular in shape, with winds swirling around a calm center, known as the eye. This is when the storm is named. Hurricane: Wind speeds reach maximum sustained winds of 74 mph. Hurricane categories Category 1: Minimal hurricane Winds 74-95 mph. Storm surge 3-5 feet.  No significant damage to buildings. Damage primarily to unanchored homes, shrubbery and trees.  Some damage to poorly constructed signs and coastal road flooding. Damage to power lines and poles could result in power outages lasting a few to several days.  Category 2: Moderate hurricane Winds 96-110 mph.  Storm surge 6-8 feet.  Some damage to buildings, mainly roofs, doors and windows. Considerable damage to shrubbery and trees. Major damage to mobile homes. Extensive damage to poorly constructed signs and considerable damage to piers.  Small crafts in unprotected anchorages may break moorings. Power outages could last from several days to weeks.  Category 3: Extensive hurricane Winds 111-130 mph.  Storm surge 9-12 feet.  Some structural damage to small buildings. Many large trees blown down. Rampant destruction of mobile homes in storms ranked category 3 or higher. Serious coastal flooding, damaging or destroying structures along the water.   Evacuation of low-lying residences within several blocks of the shoreline may be required.  Electricity and water may be unavailable for several days to weeks.  Category 4: Extreme hurricane Winds 131-155 mph.  Storm surge 13-18 feet.  Extensive building damage. Shrubs, trees and signs are blown down.  Major damage to lower floors of buildings near coastline due to flooding, battering waves and floating debris. Major beach erosion.  Power outages could last from weeks to possibly months. Areas may be uninhabitable for weeks or months.  Category 5: Catastrophic hurricane Winds greater than 155 mph.  Storm surge higher than 18 feet. Complete roof failure on many residences and industrial buildings. Widespread destruction of structures less than 15 feet above sea level within 500 yards of shore. Low-lying evacuation routes cut off by rising water 3 to 5 hours before hurricane center arrives. Advance evacuation of residential areas on low ground within 5-10 miles of the shoreline may be required. Power outages could last for months. Area may remain uninhabitable for months.  Names There are 10 regional lists of names worldwide: Atlantic, Eastern North Pacific, Central North Pacific, Western North Pacific/South China Sea, Australian Region, Nadi, Port Moresby, Jakarta, Southwest Indian Ocean and Northern Indian Ocean. Using women\u2019s names for Atlantic storms was the practice until 1979, when male names were added to the mix.    The World Meteorological Organization\u2019s Hurricane Committee creates lists of hurricane names that are recycled every six years.  Names associated with storms that have caused significant death and/or damage are retired from the list. After the 2021 season, the name Ida was retired. Some other names that have been removed include Camille (1969), Andrew (1992), Floyd (1999), Katrina (2005), Ike (2008), Sandy (2012), Maria (2017) and Ian (2022). Once a name is removed, another name replaces it.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2013/05/30/weather/hurricane-season-fast-facts/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_04_16_style_copenhagen-old-stock-exchange-fire-intl", "text": "A huge fire has engulfed Copenhagen\u2019s old stock exchange, one of the Danish capital\u2019s most famous landmarks, causing its spire to collapse as staff and citizens scrambled to rescue paintings and historic artefacts from the blaze. \u201cI cannot describe how upset I and my colleagues are,\u201d said a visibly moved Brian Mikkelsen, CEO of the Danish Chamber of Commerce, which owns and has offices in the 17th century building. \u201cIt is a huge disaster, because it is 400 years of cultural history that is in flames.\u201d Stunned commuters and onlookers watched as the raging fire could be seen swirling around the building\u2019s distinctive 56-meter spire - shaped as the tail of four entwined dragons - moments before it collapsed and fell into the street below. Some passersby even joined emergency services to run inside the burning building and help carry large Renaissance paintings and other objects away from the blaze. Among the paintings saved was Danish artist Peder Severin Kr\u00f8yer\u2019s 1895 work \u201cFrom the Copenhagen Stock Exchange,\u201d the Chamber of Commerce said. Denmark\u2019s Deputy Prime Minister, Troels Lund Poulsen, called the fire \u201cour own Notre Dame moment,\u201d referring to the blaze that destroyed the roof and spire of the Paris cathedral, five years ago almost to the day. The fire began at around 8.30 a.m. local time (2.30 a.m. ET), a Copenhagen fire department chief told CNN, and by 11 a.m. nearly half of the building had been destroyed. The fire was still burning by late afternoon. The Chamber of Commerce said it is \u201cat a loss for words for how great a tragedy this is.\u201d It said it was \u201ca sad day for our country\u201d and that \u201cthe damage will unfortunately be very expensive.\u201d \u201cWe have tried to rescue a lot of historic paintings that were inside the building and the historic furniture,\u201d Jakob Vedsted Andersen, an executive director at the Greater Copenhagen fire and rescue service, told CNN. He said it was \u201cway too soon\u201d to speculate about the causes of the blaze. Copenhagen police have told people to avoid the area and there have been no reported injuries so far. People were in the building when the fire started but they were all evacuated, said a police spokesperson who added that military personnel were at the scene to support fire-fighting efforts. A \u201cpiece of Danish history\u201d is on fire, Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said, calling the building\u2019s cultural heritage \u201cirreplaceable.\u201d The B\u00f8rsen building has been at the heart of Danish business since the 17th century. The old stock exchange \u2013 located only a few minutes walk from Christiansborg\u00a0Palace \u2013 dates back to 1625. It was built in the Dutch Renaissance style at the request of King Christian IV and had recently been undergoing renovations with its facade covered in scaffolding and protective coverings. Denmark\u2019s culture minister Jakob Engel-Schmidt said 400 years of cultural heritage had been damaged. \u201cHow touching it is to see how the employees at B\u00f8rsen, good people from the emergency services and passers-by work together to rescue art treasures and iconic images from the burning building,\u201d he added in a post on X, formerly Twitter. Emergency services were working to control the fire but it had spread to all floors through the elevator shaft. Frank Trier Mikkelsen, operations manager at the Greater Copenhagen fire department, said the fire is burning \u201cviolently\u201d inside the building, according to TV 2, a government-owned TV channel. Forty firefighters were inside the building, with valuables being rescued, TV 2 reported. Mikkelsen told the Danish broadcaster that the fire is of a type that emergency managers dread, explaining parts of the building\u2019s roof need to be removed to extinguish it. He added machines have been called in to remove some of the copper roof, as the water just bounces off it.

The body of 40-year-old Joshua Cheruiyot Kirui was found about 20 meters from the summit of the world\u2019s highest mountain, an official of Nepal\u2019s Department of Tourism told CNN. \u201cHis sherpa is still missing and the expedition agency is still searching for him,\u201d the official Gautam Khim Lal also told CNN by phone, was speaking from the foot of the mountain. Kirui, a banker based in Nairobi, and the 44-year-old guide Nawang Sherpa were reported missing early Wednesday after going out of radio contact. A rescue team then began searching for them in camps and trails along the expansive mountain, Gautam told CNN. Kirui\u2019s body was discovered on Wednesday night local time in Nepal, at about 28,970\u00a0feet (8,830 meters) above sea level. His employer KCB Bank called him \u201ca passionate athlete and mountaineer,\u201d saying he was \u201cthe second Kenyan to ever summit Mt Everest\u201d in an post on X. Kirui documented his brave attempt to climb to the peak of Everest without supplemental oxygen in his\u00a0last post on Instagram. \u201cA no-oxygen attempt comes with its special preparations and risks, physically my body is ready,\u201d he wrote, also laying out the precautions he was taking. He listed drugs he was bringing along for any potential illnesses or frostbite and said his guide would also carry an emergency bottle of oxygen. \u201cAnd so after heavy investment physically, mentally, timewise (this expedition is taking more than a month from a regular 8 to 5 banker), financially (the amount of zeros needed to make this happen means I declare bankruptcy immediately I land back in Kenya)\u2026 it\u2019s now the moment of truth,\u201d he wrote. Congratulatory comments and good luck wishes on the Instagram post were soon replaced by condolence messages as word spread that his body had been found. Kirui was a lover of the outdoors, who ran ultramarathons and climbed some of the world\u2019s most daunting mountains, according to colleagues. \u201cHis indomitable will and unwavering passion for mountaineering led him to conquer the world\u2019s most awe-inspiring landscapes,\u201d KCB Group CEO Paul Russo wrote of him. \u201cHis recent triumphs on Mt Manaslu and Mt Everest are a testament to his adventurous spirit and determination.\u201d Mount Everest, the highest peak in the Himalayan mountain range, is also the tallest mountain on Earth, rising 29,035 feet (8,850 meters) above sea level on the border between Nepal and Tibet \u2014 an autonomous region in China. More than 300 people are known to have\u00a0died on the mountain. Spring is the prime time to climb Everest, although some mountaineers might climb in the less favorable autumn season. Most climbers try to ascend the peak in May. There\u2019s a brief window of time \u2013 usually after mid-May \u2013 when temperatures are warmer, and the high-altitude winds known as the jet stream have moved away from the mountains.

{"id": "2024_05_23_europe_new-caledonia-tourists-stranded-australia-intl-hnk", "text": "When Maxwell Winchester and his wife arrived in the South Pacific island of New Caledonia nearly two weeks ago, they were excited for what would be their first child-free holiday since becoming parents. But what was supposed to be a romantic getaway has instead left the Australian couple stranded and far from their children back in their home state Victoria,\u00a0after deadly riots broke out across the French territory sparked by electoral changes\u00a0from the national government. \u201cWe are sheltered in place because it\u2019s largely been too dangerous to leave. We\u2019ve had barricades, riots \u2026 shops looted, burnt to the ground. Our suburb near us basically has nothing left,\u201d he told CNN on Thursday. In the hotel where they\u2019re staying, food and medicine are running low, he said, and there is no sense of when help is arriving; evacuations for foreign nationals have paused on Thursday due to French President Emmanuel Macron arriving for talks. \u201cWe have people who have run out of medicine \u2026 People are running out of food. Other Australians stranded have had to go scrounge coconuts to eat,\u201d he said. Now, the couple and other foreign nationals stuck on the island are desperately trying to find a way home, with commercial flights canceled and the main international airport closed. \u201cOur embassy went AWOL the first day, and we only first heard from (them) last night for the first time for a welfare call,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re frustrated with it all \u2026 What I\u2019m hoping is that our government will evacuate us promptly.\u201d Australia and New Zealand began sending government planes to evacuate nationals\u00a0starting Tuesday, with the Australian embassy in New Caledonia saying on Facebook that 108 Australians and other tourists were successfully transported from the island to Brisbane on two flights on Tuesday. \u201cWe continue to work with partners to support the departure of all Australians who want to leave,\u201d it said in a post on Wednesday. But Winchester said he and other tourists have no sense of when it might be their turn. The local government estimates there are around 3,200 people waiting to leave or enter the island. Australia\u2019s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) says on its website it is \u201ccommunicating directly with registered Australians in New Caledonia about departure options from New Caledonia,\u201d and has instructed Australians on the island to register their details on the agency\u2019s online portal. Deadly unrest Lying some 930 miles (roughly 1,500 kilometers) to the northeast of Brisbane, New Caledonia has long been a popular destination for both Australians and New Zealanders looking for some Pacific sunshine and beaches. But it is also a hangover of France\u2019s colonial past, a territory on the other side of the globe where many indigenous inhabitants suffer from entrenched poverty and have long chafed under Paris\u2019 rule. The latest protests, the worst since the 1980s, were sparked by anger among indigenous Kanak people over a constitutional amendment approved in France that would change who is allowed to participate in elections, which local leaders fear will dilute the Kanak vote. The unrest has killed at least six people, and has left a trail of burned cars and looted stores, with road barricades restricting access to medicine and food. The situation got so bad that Macron has been forced to fly some 16,000 kilometers (10,000 miles), landing on an island seething with resentment from indigenous community leaders, business owners and stranded tourists. Macron arrived in New Caledonia on Thursday, telling reporters that \u201ca return to peace\u201d was his top priority \u2013 but that\u00a0French security forces will stay in the territory\u00a0for \u201cas long as necessary, even during the Olympic Games.\u201d Three thousand French security forces have already been deployed, with a number of those still arriving Thursday, he said. He added that he believes that the state of emergency \u201cshould not be extended,\u201d provided that all political forces on the island issue a \u201cclear call for the roadblocks to be lifted.\u201d As part of his visit, Macron will \u201cset up a mission\u201d in\u00a0New\u00a0Caledonia, government spokesperson Prisca Thevenot said at a press conference earlier this week. The visit comes as France prepares for the Paris Olympic Games, which will be held from July 26 to August 11. Roads barricaded But Macron\u2019s arrival was little solace for Winchester and his wife, who are staying at a resort outside the city center. They described the anxiety and desperation inside among hotel guests and staff alike. The resort has barricaded all roads leading to the hotel, leaving just one entrance that is guarded 24/7, he said. And among the stranded tourists, frustration is growing over what they say is a lack of assistance or clear instructions from their governments. The Australian government is only notifying its nationals of evacuation plans 30 minutes before the flight \u201cfor security reasons,\u201d said Winchester \u2013 meaning \u201ceveryone is constantly on edge, and they\u2019re frightened to leave the hotel rooms in case they get a call telling them (to get on the plane).\u201d When contacted by CNN for comment, DFAT pointed to a statement online by Australia\u2019s Foreign Affairs Minister Penny Wong on Wednesday. \u201cThe Australian Government stands ready to assist more tourists out of New Caledonia and has planes ready to fly. We have not been given clearances for additional flights. We know this is frustrating for the Australians who remain,\u201d she wrote on X, formerly Twitter. \u201cWe are working to ensure flights tomorrow.\u201d With the international airport closed, evacuation flights can only leave from the domestic airport, located close to the city center \u2013 which is largely inaccessible to people staying further away, like Winchester and other guests at their resort, due to roadblocks and gun violence on the main highways. \u201cMy wife and I don\u2019t have a car, so we have no way to get to the city if we\u2019re put on a flight,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if they\u2019re going to come and evacuate us from the location we\u2019re in or not. But to drive through to the city is very dangerous in the moment.\u201d New Zealand nationals on the island are in a similar predicament \u2013 with their governments instructing them to drive to the city and leave their cars at a hotel to avoid being hijacked, before being picked up there for evacuations, he said. \u201cAnd with Macron\u2019s visit, it could get worse,\u201d he said. \u201cThe French government has not handled this well. And if (Macron) says the wrong things and then goes back to France, it could all kick off again \u2013 that\u2019s our fear.\u201d In the meantime, stranded foreign nationals continue searching for a way out \u2013 while racking up hefty bills, with Winchester describing tourists spending tens of thousands of dollars on food, accommodation and supplies. The couple is now trying to travel into the city with some New Zealand nationals, and find a flight out with them \u2013 hoping for safety in numbers on the perilous drive. \u201cFrom our own government now, their position is the French will fly us out, and we\u2019re not confident in the French government\u2019s ability to keep us safe,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/europe/new-caledonia-tourists-stranded-australia-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_05_22_europe_norway-ireland-spain-palestinian-state-analysis-intl", "text": "Europe has struggled over the Middle East for a very long time. The decision by Ireland, Spain and Norway to recognize\u00a0a\u00a0Palestinian\u00a0state\u00a0tells us more about the domestic politics of those countries than anything else. Obviously, the decision of three European nations to take this step is newsworthy and will have repercussions diplomatically, perhaps putting pressure on their allies to take a firmer stance on the Israel-Hamas conflict. However, it is also reasonable to say that thus far, no amount of pressure from even the US has had a major impact on the thinking of\u00a0Prime Minister\u00a0Benjamin Netanyahu.\u00a0Israel responded by recalling the ambassadors of the three countries, accusing them of rewarding terror with the decision. Conversations about what recognition of statehood practically means and how helpful\u00a0it is\u00a0to the Palestinian cause in the long run are all entirely valid. But the reality is that the stakes are quite low for the majority of European countries when it comes\u00a0to\u00a0issues relating to Israel and\u00a0the\u00a0Palestinians. In Ireland, Spain and Norway, support for\u00a0a Palestinian state\u00a0chimes with the broader electorate and is unlikely to receive any political blowback. That isn\u2019t necessarily the case in other European countries. While supporting a peaceful two-state solution in the long-term, Germany has been consistent in its support for Israel, as have Hungary, Poland, the UK and others. The main consequence of this is military support, which inevitably raises questions about complicity in the war against Hamas \u2013 namely weapons being used to kill civilians.\u00a0The UK government is currently under pressure to publish legal advice on whether or not selling arms to Israel falls foul of international law. But these are largely domestic issues. For a long time, European governments have\u00a0mostly\u00a0considered the Middle East \u2013 especially Israel \u2013 to be something that the US deals with,\u00a0in part due to the US\u2019s military operations in the region. European countries simply do not have a huge amount of influence in this area. The Middle East was not something that dominated European thinking in a major way until the fallout from the Arab Spring led to an enormous influx of migrants into continental Europe. Aside from the practical implications of mass migration, it also presented a security risk, with terror groups hiding among refugees and carrying out atrocities across the continent. That isn\u2019t to say Europeans didn\u2019t care about the Middle East, specifically\u00a0the Palestinian cause.\u00a0Large sections of Ireland are supportive of Palestine due to its own history of occupation, while Norway mediated the famous Oslo accords. The European Union has historically sent huge amounts of humanitarian aid into Palestinian territories and supported a two-state solution. Indeed, the European Commission responded to Wednesday\u2019s news: \u201cThe European Union has a long-standing commitment to the vision of an independent and sovereign state of Palestine, living side by side with Israel in peace and security.\u201d Whether this pushes any kind of peace process along or not remains to be seen. This is not a coordinated European effort. Norway is not a member of the EU and the idea that 27 member states would all be willing to go as far as Ireland and Spain seems extremely unlikely. Yes, it might put pressure on bigger players to take a stand. But Europe doesn\u2019t speak with one voice and is unlikely to any time soon.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/europe/norway-ireland-spain-palestinian-state-analysis-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_23_middleeast_raisi-funeral-analysis-intl", "text": "From his days as a clerical student, to overseeing executions as part of the judiciary, Ebrahim Raisi\u2019s life has been intimately tied with Iran\u2019s tumultuous modern history. Yet after all that, his presidency was notably unremarkable. Unlike previous Iranian presidents, Raisi seemed content to serve as an empty vessel that carried out the reactionary policies of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei,\u00a0the final arbiter on policymaking. He showed none of the subtle pushback of his predecessor, the moderate cleric Hassan Rouhani. He also lacked the charisma of conservative former presidents who were happy to do Khamenei\u2019s bidding\u00a0\u2013\u00a0such as the firebrand Mahmoud Ahmadinejad\u00a0\u2013\u00a0but who sought to carve out autonomy for the position of the presidency. So, when foreign dignitaries from a whopping 68 countries gathered for Raisi\u2019s funeral on Thursday, they may not have been preoccupied with thoughts of the late president. This was not a game-changing death like the 2020 assassination of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani, the military mastermind credited with creating a strategic stranglehold over much of the Middle East and helping to put the US on the backfoot. Raisi\u2019s absence, in contrast, is unlikely to be felt. Yet his untimely death could hardly have come at a more pivotal time for Iran. \u201cForeign dignitaries will be trying to get a read of the country,\u201d Washington-based Iran analyst and executive vice president of the Quincy Institute Trita Parsi told CNN. \u201cThis is also an opportunity for many of them to manifest how their relationship with Iran has changed.\u201d Iran is deeply enmeshed in the war in Gaza, with Tehran-back armed groups engaged in a low rumbling tit for tat with Israel and its allies across four different countries. In April, it launched an unprecedented direct attack on Israel from its territory after an apparent Israeli airstrike on Tehran\u2019s consulate in Damascus. In this fraught moment for the region, leaders from Turkey to India and China \u2013 many of which declared days of national mourning for the late president \u2013 appear keen not to ruffle feathers. The deaths also come after years of diplomatic efforts to achieve a rapprochement with former regional nemeses, such as\u00a0Gulf powerhouses Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates,\u00a0both of which were represented at the funeral. Qatar\u2019s emir, as well the foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Kuwait attended the funeral. Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, who the International Criminal Court is seeking an arrest warrant for alongside Israeli leaders, was also in attendance. Tens of thousands flocked to the streets to mark the funeral, throwing flowers at the coffins. It was a strong show of support for the regime, and a demonstration of its powerbase. Iran\u2019s populace is deeply polarized, but the regime showed that it could still mobilize a critical mass. Iran today seems not to be the pariah state that former US President Donald Trump almost turned it into in 2018 when he pulled out of a landmark Obama-era nuclear deal that exchanged sanctions relief for curbs to Tehran\u2019s nuclear program. \u201cThis (funeral) is a way for countries to show the progress they have made in repairing relations with Iran,\u201d said Parsi. \u201cWe have missed how Iran\u2019s relations in the region have gone through a significant transformation.\u201d Foreign dignitaries are likely engaged in sideline chats to try to get a read on Khamenei\u2019s opaque and sometimes unpredictable thinking on domestic policy\u00a0that could have repercussions for the region. Constitutionally, a presidential election must be held within 50 days of the demise of a sitting president. That is a relatively short time to prepare for a race charged with consequence for Iran\u2019s theocratic leadership. The election will have ramifications for the question of the succession plans of the ailing 85-year-old Khamenei, who is only the second Supreme Leader to rule the Islamic Republic. Moreover, the race can\u00a0either appease or, conversely, fuel the tensions brought on by\u00a0the\u00a0youth-led\u00a0nationwide uprising that rocked the country less than two years ago. Khamenei has ultimate sway over elections through the country\u2019s Guardian Council, which consists of jurists appointed by the Supreme Leader, and which is tasked with vetting election candidates. In the 2021 presidential election, the council disqualified most viable candidates besides Raisi, paving a clear path to his presidency. The race was widely seen as heavily engineered and produced a record low voter turnout. The leader may orchestrate a repeat of that race. He could also decide to change tack, opening it up so that Iran\u2019s next president enjoys broad popular support. \u201cThe election can be a watershed moment for Iran,\u201d Mohammad Ali Shabani, Iran analyst and editor of\u00a0Amwaj.media,\u00a0told CNN\u2019s Becky Anderson. \u201c(Khamenei) has a golden opportunity to reverse course in a face-saving way, make a U-turn, open up the space and allow people to run.\u201d During his tenure, Raisi made only feeble attempts to dispel the notion of him as a fig leaf president. He was widely criticized for presiding over the hollowing out of what remains of Iran\u2019s institutions. Legislative elections this March had a record low turnout of 41%.\u00a0The 2022 nationwide uprising posed the biggest domestic threat to the regime in decades. Since the brutal crushing of those protests, the bridge between the regime and its young and largely disgruntled population has grown ever wider. \u201cKhamenei has put the Islamic Republic on a path in which it will only be able to remain in power by increasing repression,\u201d said Parsi. Choosing to open up the election may appease the country\u2019s frustrated young population buckling under continued economic and political strains. That may set Iran on a course to stabilize its restive domestic situation. It may also pave a path for a more Western-friendly administration like that of Rouhani, which presided over the landmark 2015 nuclear deal, albeit within the confines set by Khamenei. Yet analysts say this remains wishful thinking. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to see why Khamenei would change course at this point. It would necessitate that he recognizes that he is on a path that is not good for him, but that\u2019s not the conclusion the regime has come to,\u201d said Parsi. \u201cBecause of the succession (of the Supreme Leadership), the regime wants the status quo. They\u2019re going to choose a direction that keeps everything as-is.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/middleeast/raisi-funeral-analysis-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_23_americas_turks-and-caicos-americans-ammunition-charges", "text": "Turks and Caicos officials have slammed remarks from US lawmakers who traveled to the islands earlier this week to press for the release of the Americans who were arrested there \u2013 and could possibly face 12-year sentences. In a House of Assembly address, the islands\u2019 Premier Washington Misick said, \u201cThe accusation of congressman (Guy Reschenthaler) against the government and people of the Turks and Caicos Islands are nothing more than diabolic falsehoods.\u201d A US congressional delegation traveled to the islands to meet with officials earlier this week to press for the release of the\u00a0detained Americans\u00a0charged with the possession of ammunition. Three of the Americans \u2013 Michael Lee Evans, Bryan Hagerich and Tyler Wenrich \u2013 have pleaded guilty to possession of ammunition while traveling in Turks and Caicos, according to the Turks and Caicos government. Hagerich is set to be sentenced on Friday at 10 a.m. ET, his lawyer Oliver Smith told CNN. A fourth person, Ryan Tyler Watson, will appear in court on June 7. A fifth person, Sharitta Shinese Grier, was arrested last week and is awaiting trial after making bail, according to Kimo Tynes\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b, director of communications in the Office of the Premier and Public Policy. The Americans face a fine for violating the government\u2019s firearm ordinance in addition to the possible 12-year sentences, but the court could give lighter sentences if it determines there are exceptional circumstances relating to the offense, according to Smith, who also represents Evans. Evans is currently out on bail and was allowed to return to the US over a \u201csevere\u201d medical situation, but will be required to return to Turks and Caicos for his next hearing, Smith said. The court is also expected to decide on a legal challenge Smith presented over the constitutionality of the legislation as it relates to how defendants can be sentenced, according to Smith. One of the US lawmakers, Sen. Markwayne Mullin, said in a statement on Monday, \u201cUnfortunately, despite our willingness to work with Turks and Caicos officials to get our constituents home, we were not able to find a path forward today.\u201d In an interview with ABC News earlier this week, Reschenthaler said, \u201cIt\u2019s to the point now, (where) every third week an American is being detained wrongfully and Turks and Caicos.\u201d On Monday, Reschenthaler told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju that he wants to see a \u201cresolution here where the Americans get zero amount of jail time. They should be given time served and be sent home to the United States.\u201d \u201cThey were innocent mistakes. Any other nation would handle this with a fine in sending that person back to the country of origin. Here, that\u2019s not happening,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cThe prison on Turks and Caicos has been flagged by the UN for humanitarian concerns.\u201d The congressman said the minimum 12-year sentence that ammunition charges carry is \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d and that the Americans brought the ammunition unknowingly. Turks and Caicos Gov. Dileeni Daniel-Selvaratna said in a news release on Wednesday that Turks and Caicos values its relationship with the US and that the two countries work in \u201cstrong partnership to tackle shared threats in the region.\u201d The statement said Turks and Caicos did not target US citizens and called Reschenthaler\u2019s remarks about the congressional delegation\u2019s trip to the islands to meet with officials \u201chighly regrettable.\u201d \u201cHis characterisation of our meeting is not one we recognise,\u201d the statement read. \u201cOur discussions were professional and respectful with a focus on clarifying the legal position and the well-being of the individuals,\u201d the statement continued. The governor added that the mandatory minimum 12-year sentence for possession of firearms and/or ammunition is in place to protect those in the islands and that the law provides discretion in \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d for the judge to impose a reduced sentence. No US citizen has received the 12-year sentence to date, according to the statement. Premier: \u2018Law must be applied even-handedly\u2019 Misick said out of a total of 195 people sentenced for firearm-related offenses over the last six years, only seven were US citizens.\u00a0The premier said Thursday no special treatment should be given to any group. \u201cThe law must be applied even-handedly,\u201d Misick said. While the US and Turks and Caicos work together in battling narcotics, terrorism and money laundering, \u201cour laws and processes are not congruent,\u201d Misick said. \u201cWe are a separate sovereignty. We respect the United States\u2019 laws and we will never think to interfere in its operation.\u201d The government of Turks and Caicos, Misick said, would take \u201cdecisive and comprehensive action to preserve the safety and security of our nation,\u201d adding while the country does not manufacture firearms or ammunition, the number of firearms finding its way to the islands has increased. The appointed member of the opposition, Alvin Garland, expressed his concern over the American citizens who have been arrested in Turks and Caicos for possession of ammunition over the last six months. Garland said the islands\u2019 governor is correct in not interfering with the ongoing court cases in order to adhere to the government\u2019s separation of powers, but added he believes most, if not all, of the cases involving American tourists will fall into the \u201cexceptional circumstances category\u201d and sentences could be shorter than the mandatory 12-year minimum.

{"id": "2024_05_17_europe_russia-ukrainian-captives-human-shields-intl-hnk", "text": "Russian forces have captured dozens of civilians in the border town of Vovchansk, a Ukrainian official has said, with a top regional police officer accusing them of using the captives as \u201chuman shields.\u201d Moscow has ramped up its offensive in northern Ukraine. Last week it\u00a0launched its most surprising operation in two years of war, crossing the northern border in renewed attempts to take Kharkiv, the country\u2019s second most populous city. Vovchansk, in the northern Kharkiv region, has faced an onslaught, with Russian forces claiming to control surrounding villages, forcing civilians to flee. The\u00a0cross-border attack came in a difficult month for Kyiv and marked another example of what\u2019s going wrong for the Ukrainians this year. Their forces are thinly stretched, with much less artillery than the Russians, grossly inadequate air defenses and above all a lack of soldiers. Their plight has been worsened by dry weather, allowing Russian mechanized units to move more easily. The deputy head of Ukrainian Defense Intelligence, Major-General Vadym Skibitsky, told the Economist last week: \u201cOur problem is very simple: we have no weapons. They always knew April and May would be a difficult time for us.\u201d Several analysts expect the Russians to broaden the border attacks westwards to Sumy region, which has seen months of raids by Russian special forces. In effect, the Russians have the manpower to stretch Ukrainian defenses through multiple points of attack hundreds of kilometers apart, forcing Kyiv to guess where\u00a0and when\u00a0an anticipated early-summer offensive will focus. Serhii Bolvinov, head of the investigative department of the Kharkiv regional police, told public broadcaster Suspilne News on Friday that Russian soldiers had kept about 40 civilians in a basement, near their \u201ccommand headquarters.\u201d The people are being interrogated, and \u201cthose conducting the interrogations call themselves FSB employees,\u201d Bolvinov said, referring to Russia\u2019s domestic security agency,\u00a0adding that the captives are being used as \u201chuman shields.\u201d He said the captives were mostly elderly people who \u201cdidn\u2019t want to evacuate until the very end\u201d and were captured when they finally decided to leave for Ukrainian-controlled territory. Bolvinov said an elderly Vovchansk resident was killed by Russian soldiers after refusing to obey their orders and trying to escape on foot. The details came a day after Ukraine\u2019s Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko\u00a0said Russians are taking civilians captive in northern Vovchansk. \u201cWe know of the first cases of executions of civilians by the Russian military,\u201d Klymenko said on his Telegram channel, adding: \u201cIn particular, one of the residents of Vovchansk tried to escape on foot, refused to obey the commands of the invaders - the Russians killed him.\u201d Police investigators had opened a criminal case on the grounds of violations of rules of war, he said, adding that evacuations were underway in that area until Thursday. CNN is unable to independently verify\u00a0Bolvinov\u2019s claims and has contacted the Russian Defense Ministry for comment. Russia has not commented on its troops using civilians as human shields or targeting those trying to evacuate. Russian forces launched airstrikes on Kharkiv Friday, killing at least three people and injuring 28, mayor Ihor Terekhov said in a Telegram post. Oleh Syniehubov, head of Kharkiv regional military administration, said in a Telegram post on Friday that the district was hit twice by guided aerial bombs. Nearly 10,000 people have beeen evacuated in the Kharkiv region due to Russia\u2019s renewed offensive, the head of the Kharkiv regional military administration, Oleh Syniehubov, said in a Telegram update on Saturday morning. The evacuations took place over seven days following Russia\u2019s surprise cross-border offensive into northern Ukraine, which began on the morning of May 10. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky last week postponed all upcoming international visits as the country grapples with the new offensive. In an interview with news agency AFP aired on Friday, Zelensky\u00a0said the Russian offensive in Kharkiv region is \u201cnot stabilized, it is controlled.\u201d He said Ukrainian forces are controlling Russian troops\u2019 entry routes into the region but that the Russian operation continues. He also said there may be several waves of Russian attacks on the region, and emphasized the need for Patriot missile systems to push Russian troops out of Kharkiv. The United States announced last week a $400 million package of air defense munitions and other weapons.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/europe/russia-ukrainian-captives-human-shields-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "world"}}

There\u2019s the Art Deco curved crown of the Chrysler Building, the sweeping isosceles triangles that twist around One World Trade Center, the stepped limestone and granite rectangles of the Empire State Building and the triangular prism of the Flatiron Building. And now, a multi-billion-dollar tower featuring floor-to-ceiling glass will add another dimension to the cityscape, according to new details unveiled by New York City Mayor Eric Adams this week. Stretching up 62 stories, a planned office tower at 350 Park Avenue will provide space for more than 6,000 jobs, plus 1.8 million square feet of commercial office space, according to a press release. It will be funded by Vornado Realty Trust, Kenneth Griffin, founder and CEO of global investment firm Citadel, and building and management company Rudin. White columns will frame a new public concourse at the base of the new building on Park Avenue, complete with green space, seating and art displays, images show. Above, landscaped terraces will top each section of the glass-clad tower which will house the offices for Citadel and market making firm Citadel Securities. Adams hailed the project in the release, saying it will help \u201csupercharge our economy and expand New York City\u2019s iconic skyline,\u201d building on \u201ccontinued efforts to energize Midtown Manhattan as the world\u2019s most important business address and an economic engine for working-class New Yorkers.\u201d Architects Foster + Partners have designed the building, which will replace the existing 30-story tower currently at the site in Midtown Manhattan just a few blocks away from landmarks like the Rockefeller Center, St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral and Grand Central Station. As New York continues to deal with the economic aftershocks wrought by the Covid-19 pandemic, Adams and his administration said in their respective statements that they hoped this project would continue the city\u2019s recovery. \u201cThis investment opens a new chapter for Midtown \u2014 and closes the book on those who predicted its demise,\u201d said deputy mayor for operations Meera Joshi. \u201cMidtown\u2019s revitalization is being led by its public realm \u2014 including investments in Fifth Avenue, with the crown jewels of Central Park and Bryant Park at either end. Together, with our business improvement district and parks partners, we are reintroducing Fifth Avenue to the world and creating a vibrant live, work, play community for a new era,\u201d Joshi added. Building this new office space comes at a fraught time for the commercial real estate market as businesses struggle to entice workers back to the office after years of working from home. This has left vast tranches of office space vacant or underused, causing the value of such buildings to plummet at the same time as historically high interest rates have made it harder for real estate developers \u2014\u00a0who often take out huge loans to finance projects \u2014\u00a0to make good on their repayments. The project will begin the city\u2019s public review process early next year and the tower is expected to be completed by 2032, according to the release.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/20/style/park-avenue-skyscraper-new-york-skyline-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_21_asia_singapore-airlines-turbulence-passenger-intl-hnk", "text": "Passengers on a Singapore Airlines flight hit by severe turbulence on Tuesday described a sudden, dramatic drop as \u201call hell broke loose\u201d on board the Boeing airliner carrying 229 passengers and crew. At first, \u201cthe flight was perfectly normal,\u201d said passenger Andrew Davies, who was traveling to New Zealand for business. He described the flight as \u201cquite smooth \u2026 I don\u2019t remember any turbulence at all.\u201d Flight SQ321 was cruising at 37,000 feet from London to Singapore when flight tracking data shows the plane dropped sharply before climbing several hundred feet, then repeated the dip and ascent, for about a minute. Many passengers were having breakfast at the time of the incident. Then, about nine or 10 hours into the roughly 13-hour flight, he was watching a movie when he saw the seat belt sign light up \u2013 so he put his seat belt on. \u201cThank goodness I did because within moments of doing that, all hell broke loose,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s \u201cErin Burnett OutFront.\u201d \u201cThe plane just felt like it dropped. It probably only lasted a few seconds, but I remember vividly seeing shoes and iPads and iPhones and cushions and blankets and cutlery and plates and cups flying through the air and crashing to the ceiling. The gentleman next to me had a cup of coffee, which went straight all over me and up to the ceiling,\u201d Davies said. Images from the plane afterward show the cabin in disarray, with papers, cups and water pitchers scattered on the floor, and ceiling panels and piping hanging loose. Davies was sitting toward the front of the plane and witnessed some of the injuries sustained by dozens of passengers \u2013 including Geoff Kitchen, a 73-year-old Briton who died on the flight. \u201cThat gentleman was sitting right behind me,\u201d he said. \u201cLots of people needed some help but we tended to this gentleman, and I helped carry him, get him out of the seat, and we laid him on the floor so that some medical professions could administer CPR.\u201d Kitchen was given CPR for about 20 minutes, said Davies. Meanwhile, he said, \u201cthere was so much screaming,\u201d and people\u2019s injuries were evident; when he turned around, he saw one passenger with \u201ca big gash in her head and blood pouring down her face,\u201d and another elderly passenger in \u201csevere shock.\u201d Another passenger, 28-year-old student Dzafran Azmir, told Reuters that the aircraft had begun \u201ctilting up\u201d and shaking. \u201cVery suddenly there was a very dramatic drop so everyone seated and not wearing a seatbelt was launched immediately into the ceiling,\u201d he told Reuters. \u201cSome people hit their heads on the baggage cabins overhead and dented it, they hit the places where lights and masks are and broke straight through it.\u201d Azmir added that the whole thing was \u201creally, really quick \u2013 which is why I think nobody could really respond to it.\u201d People didn\u2019t have time to react, he said \u2013 there were passengers in the plane bathrooms and air crew still standing when the turbulence hit. The plane was diverted to Bangkok after the incident, which injured 104 of the passengers, according to an update at Wednesday lunchtime from the Samitivej Srinakarin Hospital, which treated many of the travelers. Those injured on the flight included citizens from Australia, Malaysia, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Spain, the United States and Ireland, the hospital said in an earlier update. Those needing medical assistance were sent to several hospitals in the Thai capital, while others were looked after at a clinic at the airport. Samitivej Srinakarin Hospital said 20 travelers remained in intensive care units on Wednesday. Josh Silverstone, one of the passengers on the Singapore Airlines flight, described feeling \u201chappy to be alive\u201d as he was leaving Samitivej Srinakarin Hospital on Wednesday evening. Speaking with journalists on his way out, the 24-year-old British citizen said he had suffered a cut on his eye and a chipped tooth in the turbulence. He also said that after the incident had taken place, he had let his mother know he was ok by purchasing an in-flight Wifi package\u00a0for the first time in his life. Silverstone described the aftermath of the emergency landing in Bangkok, saying he started vomiting,\u00a0which prompted him to look for medical care. According to Silverstone, there are still several passengers being treated at the hospital, many apparently with spinal injuries and in a much worse physical state than he is. Silverstone told journalists he was \u201cgoing to Bali to see my boys\u201d when the horror on SQ321 unfolded, but he still hopes to eventually get there. Of the 211 passengers and 18 crew on board the original flight, 143 were transported via a relief flight to Singapore, where they landed early Wednesday morning, according to Singapore Airlines CEO\u00a0Goh Choon Phong in a video message released on Facebook. The remaining 79 passengers and 6 crew members are still in Bangkok, including those receiving medical care, and their family members. Kittipong Kittikachorn, the general manager of the Bangkok airport, said on Tuesday that preliminary investigations suggest Kitchen had suffered from a heart condition, and that the autopsy process is ongoing. Several passengers\u00a0had broken arms, but the majority of injuries were cuts and bruises, he added. Goh, the CEO, extended his condolences to Kitchen\u2019s family and loved ones, saying the airline was \u201cdeeply saddened by this incident\u201d and was \u201cvery sorry for the traumatic experience\u201d that passengers endured. The airline is cooperating with authorities on the investigation, he added. Singapore\u2019s Ministry of Transport is investigating the incident, saying Tuesday it was in touch with its Thai counterparts and would be sending investigators to Bangkok. The US National Transportation Safety Board is also sending personnel to Singapore to help the investigation, including a representative of the board and four technical advisors.

{"id": "2024_05_23_americas_mexico-stage-collapse-presidential-candidate-intl-hnk", "text": "Nine people were killed and a presidential candidate was briefly taken to hospital after a stage collapsed under heavy winds at a campaign rally in Mexico on Wednesday. Candidate Jorge \u00c1lvarez M\u00e1ynez said he was not injured in the incident, which happened during his campaign event in the northeastern city of San Pedro Garza Garc\u00eda. The governor of Mexico\u2019s Nuevo Leon state said at least 121 people were injured and has offered to pay for funeral and hospital costs for the victims. Among the dead is one minor, Governor Samuel Garc\u00eda Sep\u00falveda said in a post on X, adding that some of the injured are stable while others are undergoing surgery. \u201dWhat we experienced happened in just a few seconds: A gale came, a sudden wind, and unfortunately, it collapsed the stage, resulting in a fatal accident,\u201d \u00c1lvarez M\u00e1ynez told Reuters. \u201cI first saw the musicians\u2019 drums, from the group that was going to play, were going to get blown away. When the others noticed, they ran in different directions; some jumped to the sides (of the stage), and I jumped back.\u201d Videos shared on social media showed the moment a strong gust caused the stage to collapse. \u00c1lvarez M\u00e1ynez and his team can be seen running for cover as the structure, which included a large video screen, falls onto the stage and part of the audience area. Footage taken in the aftermath of the accident shows a large number of emergency vehicles at the scene, their lights flashing in the darkness, as injured people are carried away. The area was cordoned off and guarded by heavily armed security personnel. Nearby observations from Monterrey show there were thunderstorms that brought gusty winds to at least 40 to 50 kilometers (around 25 to 30 miles per hour). The stage location was likely impacted by a gust front, which is when gusty winds suddenly pick up and change direction from nearby thunderstorms. \u00c1lvarez M\u00e1ynez later said he was suspending all campaign activities after the collapse but would remain in the state to monitor the situation and victims. \u201cWe have to have solidarity, there is nothing that can repair an accident, a damage of this nature, and [people] will not be alone in this tragedy and through the consequences that this tragedy will have in their lives,\u201d \u00c1lvarez M\u00e1ynez said. The 38-year old congressman is representing the center-left Citizens\u2019 Movement party, and was named party candidate in January after Garc\u00eda Sep\u00falveda dropped out. Garc\u00eda Sep\u00falveda was forced to return to his duties as governor as political chaos erupted under his interim replacement, making his presidential campaign untenable. During his daily press conference, Mexico\u2019s President\u00a0Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador sent  condolences to the victims\u2019 families and expressed his support for Citizens\u2019 Movement. \u201cWe know that they are not to blame,\u201d he said, calling for authorities to investigate. The vote looms Mexico is heading\u00a0toward its largest election\u00a0in history on June 2, which has been marred by spiking political violence and assassinations. The presidential vote is seen as a two-horse race between a former Mexico City mayor, Claudia Sheinbaum, a close ally of the Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, and a former senator Xochitl G\u00e1lvez who is representing the opposition coalition. With the two women far ahead in the polls, Mexico is almost certainly going to elect its first female president in June. An estimated 70,000 candidates have stepped forward to compete for more than 20,000 positions, including the national presidency and the governorships of nine states. So far this year,\u00a0at least\u00a028 candidates have been attacked, with 16 killed, according to\u00a0data through April 1 from\u00a0the research group Data C\u00edvica, a figure set to outpace even the bloodiest election cycles in\u00a0Mexico\u2019s past.  Speaking to reporters, \u00c1lvarez M\u00e1ynez said Civil Defense teams had checked the \u201cstructure of the set\u201d prior to the event but that the severity of the wind gusts had caught organizers by surprise. \u201cThe weather conditions were very atypical: the rain didn\u2019t last for even five minutes \u2026 it wasn\u2019t even a storm, it was truly atypical what happened,\u201d he said. The presidential candidate said an investigation into the incident would take place. Governor Garc\u00eda Sep\u00falveda urged people in the area to stay indoors, warning of more strong winds, thunderstorms and rain.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/americas/mexico-stage-collapse-presidential-candidate-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "world"}}

If Abinader wins, he will be in office until 2028. The 56-year-old former economist and businessman first assumed the presidency in 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic and has presided over one of the fastest-growing economies in the region. The popular leader has promised four more years of economic growth and experts expect Abinader to expand on his first term\u2019s priorities, which include development, reform, and the fight against corruption. The vote comes amid the spiraling\u00a0political and social crisis\u00a0in\u00a0neighboring Haiti, which shares the island of Hispaniola with the Dominican Republic.\u00a0The crisis has seen Abinader\u2019s administration seal the island\u2019s shared border and airspace. He has also been accused of stoking anti-Haitian sentiment, and in 2022, the United States embassy warned Black and \u201cdarker-skinned Americans\u201d that they risk \u201cincreased interaction\u201d with Dominican authorities amid an immigration crackdown.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/americas/dominican-republic-election-luis-abinader-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_17_europe_hostages-recovered-gaza-idf-intl", "text": "The Israeli military announced Saturday that it had recovered the body of a hostage from the Gaza Strip, one day after saying it had retrieved the remains of three others in the besieged territory. The hostage was identified as Ron Benjamin, who was killed on October 7 at the Mefalsim intersection during the Hamas attack, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said in a news conference. Benjamin\u2019s body was abducted by Hamas and taken to Gaza, he added. The three previous hostages were identified as Shani Louk, Amit Bouskila, and Itshak Gelernter, Hagari said in a press conference in Tel Aviv on Friday. All three were taken hostage on October 7 and were\u00a0killed while escaping the Nova music festival and their bodies taken into Gaza, the IDF said. \u201cThey were celebrating life in the Nova music festival and they were murdered by Hamas,\u201d he said. The bodies were identified by authorities and the families have been informed, Hagari said, adding that the bodies had been transferred to medical professionals for forensic examination. Hagari did not disclose where the bodies were found during the press conference. He said the bodies were recovered during a joint IDF and Shin Bet operation. CNN analyst and Axios reporter Barak Ravid,\u00a0citing an IDF spokesperson,\u00a0reported\u00a0the bodies were found in a tunnel in Gaza. Nissim Louk, father of Shani Louk whose body was one of those recovered also told Israeli media his daughter\u2019s body was very well preserved because it had been kept in a \u201cdeep and very cold tunnel\u201d. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed his grief in a\u00a0post on X\u00a0on Friday. \u201cThe heart breaks for the great loss. My wife Sara and I grieve with the families. All our hearts are with them in this hour of grieving,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will return all our hostages, the dead and the alive alike. I congratulate our brave forces who, with determined action, have returned our sons and daughters home,\u201d he added. Of the three hostages, only Louk had previously been confirmed dead by the Israeli government. The 23-year-old German-Israeli woman was declared dead by the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs in late October. A source involved with her identification told CNN Louk\u2019s death was announced after forensic examiners found a bone fragment from her skull. Her lifeless body was seen on video on the back of a Hamas truck after the music festival attack. Louk\u2019s family said they feel some closure now that her body has been recovered. In a statement given to CNN, the family said the IDF came to their house on Friday and informed them that they were able to rescue Louk\u2019s body from a tunnel in Gaza and bring her back to Israel. \u201cEvery news like this brings us back to the horrific moment we had to find out that our loving daughter was brutally murdered by Hamas on the 7th of October. However,\u00a0it is also a relief to get the body back and we are now able to bury her close by. It gives us some kind of closure,\u201d the family said. \u201cWe want to remember Shani as the beautiful and peace-loving person she was, who loved music, dancing and life. She brought us and many other people in the world light and the belief in good. This is how we choose to remember Shani,\u201d the statement added. Around 240 people were taken hostage and moved to Gaza during Hamas\u2019 October 7 attack on Israel which also killed more than 1,200 people. In the seven months since that attack, Israel has launched a war in Gaza that has killed\u00a0more than 35,000 Palestinians, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. A little more than 100 hostages were freed during a release deal in November, but the IDF believes there are still 132 hostages being held in Gaza, 128 of whom were taken on October 7. The IDF believed that of those 132 hostages, 40 are believed to be dead, including two who were taken in 2014. A deal to secure the release of the remaining hostages has remained elusive for months, despite rounds of talks between Israeli and Hamas negotiating teams. Last Friday, Hamas militants said Israel\u2019s rejection of a ceasefire plan submitted by mediators at negotiations in Cairo had sent hostage release talks back to \u201csquare one.\u201d The statement came a day after the latest round of Gaza truce and hostage deal talks ended in Cairo, without a deal. The militant group also accused Netanyahu of hindering the ceasefire talks, so as to use negotiations as a cover to attack the southern Gaza city of Rafah.

{"id": "2024_05_22_india_pune-india-teen-drunk-driving-anger-intl-hnk", "text": "Anger is growing in India after a teenager who allegedly killed two people while drunk driving was ordered to write an essay as punishment, with many demanding a harsher penalty and accusing the judiciary of leniency. The 17-year-old boy was allegedly speeding in a Porsche in the city of Pune\u00a0on Sunday when the vehicle hit a motorcycle, killing two people, according to Maharashtra state\u2019s deputy chief minister Devendra Fadnavis. The minor was taken into custody and later presented to the Juvenile Justice Board, where he was released on bail and given 15 days of community service. He was also asked to write an essay about road safety, Fadnavis said. \u201cThe outrage grew after this. According to police, the boy is 17 years and 8 months. This is a heinous crime,\u201d he told reporters Tuesday, pointing to the 2015 changes to India\u2019s juvenile laws, which allow children above 16 to be tried as adults if they allegedly commit a \u201cheinous\u201d crime. \u201cThis was a surprising order passed (by the Juvenile Justice Board),\u201d Fadnavis said. Following the outrage, the minor\u2019s lawyer, Prashant Patil, on Wednesday told reporters that the teen\u2019s bail terms were modified, with the Juvenile Justice Board ordering him to remain in a rehabilitation home until June 5. The minor will receive counseling, Patil said. CNN has attempted to contact the Patil for comment. Fadnavis added that Pune police are investigating the minor for alleged culpable homicide not amounting to murder. They have also asked the Juvenile Court to review its bail order, he said. CCTV video, purportedly filmed moments before the crash, shows a white Porsche speeding down a busy main road. People can be seen rushing to the scene of the crash, which is not pictured in the video that was shared widely on social media and broadcast on local news channels. The minor\u2019s father has been arrested for allegedly allowing his son to drive despite being underage, according to Pune Police Commissioner Amitesh Kumar. The legal driving age in India is 18. Three people who served the minor liquor have also been arrested, Kumar added. \u201cWe have adopted the most stringent possible approach, and we shall do whatever is at our command to ensure that the two young lives that were lost get justice, and the accused gets duly punished,\u201d he said. The incident has dominated headlines in India and sparked widespread anger, with many taking to social media to condemn the boy\u2019s bail conditions. Suresh Koshta, whose 24-year-old daughter was killed in the crash, urged authorities to take tougher action against the alleged driver. \u201cIt was wrong (to allow the minor to drive),\u201d he told reporters outside his home, while fighting back tears. \u201cOne needs to know how to drive first.\u201d Rahul Gandhi, the leader of India\u2019s main opposition, the Indian National Congress, questioned whether a bus or taxi driver would be given the same punishment. \u201cIf a 16-17-year-old son of a wealthy household, driving a Porsche under the influence, is caught, he is asked to write an essay,\u201d Gandhi said in a video posted to X. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t essays assigned to truck drivers or bus drivers?\u201d This isn\u2019t the first time a court\u2019s verdict has been scrutinized in this manner. In 2015, Bollywood superstar\u00a0Salman Khan, who was facing a lengthy prison sentence for a fatal hit-and-run, got a reprieve when the Bombay High Court tossed out his conviction for lack of evidence, causing widespread outrage. \u201cOn basis of evidences produced by the prosecution, the appellant cannot be convicted, no matter how differently the common man thinks,\u201d the court said. The hit-and-run incident took place outside a Mumbai bakery in September 2002, with prosecutors saying Khan ran over five sleeping men after losing control of his vehicle. He was returning from a bar after a night of drinking, they said. The actor said he wasn\u2019t the driver. One of the victims was killed; the others injured.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/india/pune-india-teen-drunk-driving-anger-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "world"}}

Mackinlay, who is a member of parliament for the governing Conservative party, representing South Thanet in southeast England, fell ill on September 28, 2023. He told the BBC that he started to feel ill and turned \u201ca very strange blue\u201d within about 30 minutes. \u201cMy whole body, top to bottom, ears, everything, blue,\u201d he said in an interview released Wednesday, describing the symptoms of septic shock. Sepsis is the body\u2019s extreme response to an infection. It can be spurred by any type of infection, even a minor one, and occurs when germs enter a person\u2019s body and multiply, causing illness and organ and tissue damage. The life-threatening condition requires urgent medical care to prevent organ damage and death. In some cases, sepsis or the infections leading up to it are not properly identified because they can come with a wide range of symptoms such as confusion or disorientation, shortness of breath, high heart rate, fever, shivering or feeling very cold, extreme pain or discomfort, and clammy or sweaty skin, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Mackinlay was put into an induced coma with multiple organ failures, and told UK media outlet GB News that there is a period of around three weeks where he can\u2019t remember what happened. When he woke up, he found that his hands and feet had turned black. \u201cI could see these things were probably lost,\u201d he said. On November 30, Mackinlay recorded a video from his hospital bed in which he showed the damage to his limbs. \u201cit\u2019s caused the complete death of my hands and also my feet,\u201d he said, describing them as \u201cgnarled, dry, dessicated\u201d and revealing that he was due to undergo a quadruple amputation the next day. \u201cThe reality is I probably shouldn\u2019t have survived this far,\u201d said Mackinlay. \u201cThe grim reaper let me survive, but he\u2019s taken his payment in four of my limbs,\u201d he adds. Mackinlay\u2019s wife, Kati Mackinlay, told GB News that doctors told her he had only a 5% chance of survival, but she remained hopeful. \u201cI never said goodbye, I never thought that\u2019s it for Craig,\u201d she said. \u201cI always knew that Craig would pull through and he did.\u201d The operation, in which his arms were amputated from the elbow and his legs from the knee, took around 4-5 hours, Mackinlay told GB News. He then went through a rehabilitation process to learn how to live with prosthetic arms and legs. He has also some scarring to his face and ears due to a lack of blood supply, he added. Nonetheless, Mackinlay is eager to get back to work. \u201cGet back into the saddle, get back into Parliament, get back doing the things I enjoy,\u201d he told GB News.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/uk/craig-mckinlay-sepsis-return-scli-intl-gbr/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_04_10_style_graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers", "text": "Climbing up abandoned, unfinished floors and tightrope walking across balcony ledges, backpacks clanging with cans of alkyd and acrylic, a collective of Los Angeles graffiti artists have transformed their craft beyond urban aesthetics to champion community issues. Their choice of canvas: Oceanwide Plaza in Downtown LA. Occupying over a full square city block, the plaza was imagined as a vast mixed-use building project, offering city residents over 500 lavish condominiums, a five-star hotel, retail spaces, restaurants and a private 2-acre park. However, construction on the $1 billion project, which began in 2015, was shelved after the Chinese-backed contractor Oceanwide Holdings ran out of funding\u00a0in 2019 \u2014 and it has lain unfinished ever since. The plaza\u2019s status \u2014 and potential \u2014 as an eye-catching venue for their work spread by word of mouth within the graffiti community in recent months. Security at the site was known to be lax, an important detail as accessing the plaza\u2019s towers and other buildings constitutes trespassing. (The Los Angeles City Attorney confirmed to CNN that, as of April 3, criminal charges have been filed against 23 individuals, for violations including trespassing and possession of vandalism tools.) \u201cIt was like a gift from the graffiti gods\u2026 A giant canvas in the middle of downtown,\u201d tagger ENDEM told CNN, speaking on behalf of himself and his graffiti crew, NCT. \u201cWe were like, \u2018Let\u2019s do it right. Let\u2019s do it as if the whole world is going to see this.\u2019\u201d Historically, graffiti has often been used as protest art. While the practice dates back thousands of years, it\u2019s most commonly viewed in a contemporary context (within graffiti\u2019s \u201cmodern\u201d era, which dates back to the 1960s and 70s) as a creative vehicle for challenging societal norms and inequities \u2014 whether on the Berlin Wall in Germany or subway cars in New York City; whether painted by anonymous artists or well-known figures like Keith Haring or Banksy, even if the latter is, technically, anonymous himself. Still, neither ENDEM nor any of the other artists involved realized how famous their work on the Oceanside towers would become. Sharing his artwork on Instagram on January 31, a video from ENDEM quickly racked up tens of thousands of views: Vibrant images of bright block lettering splayed across the building\u2019s exterior paired with footage from the inside \u2014 the artist posing with shots of his spray paint cans, poised above the cityscape. The viral footage, among other visuals shared on social media, quickly opened the floodgates. Hitting Oceanside became a mark of credibility in the graffiti world; by mid-February, the number of tags and other graffiti pieces there were multiplying overnight. \u201cIt was an open house people going in and out. It was beautiful. It was like graffiti paradise,\u201d ENDEM said. \u201cIt felt exactly like the streets, but concentrated.\u201d Transformed in part into an art installation, Oceanwide became an opportunity for the graffiti artists to leave a message to the city below, and a call-out to policy makers who leave buildings to rot. \u201cGraffiti shows you where the city hurts,\u201d Roger Gastman, owner and founder of the LA-based arts organization Beyond the Streets, told CNN. Renowned for its large-scale exhibitions, immersive educational programs, pop-up events and partnerships, Beyond the Streets works to educate and celebrate the diverse dimensions of graffiti as a medium. To him, the mission of graffiti is clear: to challenge, educate, and redefine public perception of the medium. Earl Ofari Hutchinson, president of The Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable, a nonpartisan public policy forum\u00a0for civic participation and education,\u00a0sees the abandoned towers as amplifying the social issues of the community they are situated in, connecting the graffiti-laden structures to the urban blight that surrounds them in LA\u2019s Skid Row. Skid Row is a 50-block sector of downtown LA where between 8,000 and 11,000 unhoused people live in challenging, often squalid conditions. \u201cYou\u2019ve got tens of thousands of people displaced because of over urban development. And as a result of that, they\u2019re on the streets,\u201d Hutchinson told CNN, noting that the homeless population in Los Angeles is continuing to grow. (The Los Angeles Housing Services Authority reports a 9% increase in homelessness in LA county in 2023 and a 10% increase in the city from 2022.) \u201cNow, set right in the middle of that, you have\u2026 a development that will never be completed.\u201d \u201cWhat you have here is a classic urban nightmare brought on by very poor policies \u2014 fiscal, financial, budgetary and political problems (in) a city that has just gone off the rails in terms of over-development and lack of affordability,\u201d Hutchinson added. Still, Hutchinson is no fan of the graffiti either. To him, and many other LA residents who have said they disapprove of the \u201cvandalism,\u201d the plaza is a sore sight for eyes. \u201cThe problem is you\u2019re talking about violating public space and with no permission\u2026 that doesn\u2019t fly with me,\u201d Hutchinson said. \u201cThe fact of the matter is, the public has not given you approval. (And) the general public has to pay for the removal.\u201d Costs currently borne by the taxpayer at the Oceanwide Plaza site include the security details provided by the LAPD as well as the graffiti cleanup Hutchinson highlights. (\u201cThis has strained our deployment,\u201d LAPD Chief Michel Moore said during a February meeting of the Los Angeles City Council. \u201cWe have called in some officers on an overtime basis so that we can provide for these added patrols or station them at that site to deter vandals and others from gaining access.\u201d) Clean teams working in the neighborhoods surrounding Oceanwide remove on average some 2,000 square feet of graffiti per week, with that figure growing in recent months. \u201cPeople forget that people live here. People own businesses here and they don\u2019t want to have to spend the time and money to clean it up,\u201d said Blair Besten, executive director of the Historic Core of Downtown Los Angeles, an organization which works to improve the quality of life in downtown neighborhoods. The Historic Core prioritizes street sweeping, trash collection \u2014 and graffiti removal. \u201cI would hardly call what they\u2019re doing art,\u201d Besten argued of the Oceanwide taggers. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty sloppy and quick. They come in fast and they knock it out and they leave.\u201d But to Gastman, graffiti is a powerful form of expression, and a call-to-action \u2014 particularly for those who emanate from struggles within home life, gang life or societal turmoil. Graffiti culture can offer an unexpected support system for those the city has abandoned, Gastman said. It becomes a platform for them to make their voices heard. \u201cIn graffiti culture, a lot of us know each other. We\u2019re all friends. We have the same mentality \u2014 we\u2019re just trying to get up. We\u2019re just trying to get noticed,\u201d explained ENDEM. In the midst of an addiction that led to his rock bottom, graffiti became his lifeline, he explained. \u201cI was at my lowest of lows, still trying to stay sober, I needed some type of outlet,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cGraffiti is something that you can hold on to. Its bigger than me, its everyone, it\u2019s a community.\u201d In this, ENDEM believes that the beauty of Oceanwide isn\u2019t tangible. Rather, it lies in the birth of a new generation of graffiti writers. \u201cThey can erase the graffiti on buildings, but they can never erase the impact that it has on the city of Los Angeles and the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to it. Yes, it\u2019s vandalism. Yes, it\u2019s art, and it\u2019s everything in between,\u201d Gastman concluded. \u201cThis is a real culture. It\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/10/style/graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "world"}}

The video shows the women \u2014 all Israel Defense Forces (IDF) personnel \u2014 lined up against a wall, their hands bound. The faces of some of the women are bruised and bloodied. The footage was previously released by Hamas, according to the Hostages Families Forum. The campaigning group obtained it from the IDF, which had previously edited the video to exclude the most disturbing scenes. \u201cEvery new testimony about what happened to the hostages echoes the same tragic truth \u2013 we must bring them all back home, now,\u201d the Hostage Families Forum said in a press release Wednesday. The\u00a0women were\u00a0kidnapped during a Hamas raid on Israel\u2019s Nahal Oz military base, near the northern Gaza Strip, as part of the militant group\u2019s attacks on Israel that left around 1,200 people dead and saw more than 250 captured and taken hostage in the enclave. Following the attack,\u00a0Israel\u00a0launched a war in Gaza that has killed\u00a0more than 35,000 Palestinians\u00a0over the past seven months, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza. The\u00a0kidnapped\u00a0women were working as IDF observers, a role that involves monitoring Israel\u2019s border security. Video of the ordeal has been made public as pressure mounts on Netanyahu to secure the release of the Israelis still held by Hamas,\u00a0which his government has made a key goal of the Gaza offensive. Numerous attempts to strike a hostage-for-ceasefire deal with Hamas have faltered in recent months, infuriating those in Israel campaigning for the return of the captives. \u201cThe State of Israel cannot accept a reality where its citizens constantly feel their lives are threatened and suffer from unrelenting fear and anxiety,\u201d the Hostages Families Forum\u00a0said\u00a0as it publicized the video on Wednesday. \u201cWith each passing day, it becomes more challenging to bring the hostages back home \u2013 the living for rehabilitation and the murdered for proper burial.

And that is our responsibility.\u201d \u2018For the world to see\u2019 One of the women shown in the video, Ori Megidish, was\u00a0rescued by the IDF in a special operation\u00a023 days after being taken.

But five of the seven \u2014 Liri Albag, Karina Ariev, Agam Berger, Daniela Gilboa, and Naama Levy \u2014 remain in captivity, more than seven months after being taken across the border. The mother of Naama Levy told CNN on Wednesday that bringing them home is not\u00a0a top priority of the Israeli government, saying some members of the government did not even watch the video. \u201cMinisters and\u00a0members of the government were asked to watch a version of this video in their meetings, and some of them refused and said we want to sleep OK at night,\u201d Ayelet Levy Shachar said, adding, \u201cSo if this is the reaction when it\u2019s their duty to watch these materials, this is their job, so they can make correct decisions, then we think that we should put it out there for our citizens, for the world to see.\u201d More than 100 hostages were freed during a release deal in November, but the IDF believes there are still around 130 people being held in Gaza.

The protest marks a chaotic start to the presidency of Lai Ching-te, who was sworn in Monday after winning a historic third consecutive term for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which champions Taiwan\u2019s sovereignty and is loathed by Beijing. It also illustrates  the challenges Lai\u2019s fledgling administration faces without a parliamentary majority, which is now controlled by two opposition parties, the Kuomintang (KMT) and Taiwan People\u2019s Party (TPP). Demonstrators are angered by what they see as the KMT and TPP\u2019s attempt to fast track a bill through the legislature, which would grant the parliament sweeping powers to impose greater oversight over the executive branch of government. Some protesters carried sunflowers, in a nod to the student-led protest movement in 2014 that saw hundreds of students occupying the legislature for weeks in protest against the KMT\u2019s controversial trade deal with China. Those protests were instrumental two years later in the electoral defeat of the KMT, which has since been unable to recapture the presidency. Under the proposed legislation, government officials could be fined or jailed under what critics say is a vaguely worded new criminal offense of \u201ccontempt of parliament,\u201d if they were found making false statements to the legislature. They could also be punished if they refused to answer questions or provide documents, or withheld information during hearings. Meanwhile, the president would be required to deliver an annual address to the parliament on key policy issues. Opponents say the proposals could force officials to disclose sensitive information to parliament \u2013 such as those relating to diplomacy and defense \u2013 or face criminal penalties. They believe this could potentially undermine the island\u2019s security. The DPP has also accused the opposition of trying to force through the bill without allocating sufficient time for policy deliberations. Meanwhile, the KMT and TPP argue the new laws are needed to improve government accountability and combat corruption, pointing to similar legislative checks and balances on executive powers around the world. They also accused the DPP of spreading disinformation and trying to paralyze the legislature. In a sign of the heated political divide, disagreements over the controversial reform bill erupted last Friday in a brawl on the parliamentary floor \u2013 a chaotic display that saw some lawmakers leaping over tables and pulling colleagues to the floor, with a few members taken to hospital. On Tuesday, as the parliament resumed its meeting to discuss the bill, protesters gathered outside the Legislative Yuan \u2013 Taiwan\u2019s unicameral parliament \u2013 from morning until midnight, braving downpours in the afternoon. Many joined after finishing school and work, with organizers claiming more than 30,000 participants. Some held up signs calling the legislative process a \u201cblack box\u201d and demanding the bill to be withdrawn. Others chanted: \u201cNo discussions, no democracy!\u201d Ricky Li, a 28-year-old office worker, said he was worried about the bill\u2019s vague wording and lack of consultation. \u201cI\u2019m concerned that it will open the door to power abuses by the legislators \u2026 What if legislators start using the newly acquired power to wage vendettas against their political opponents?\u201d he said, noting that the bill has not been sufficiently discussed and lacks transparency. \u201cGiven the current circumstances of cross-strait relations and that a new government just took office, the opposition\u2019s assault on Taiwan\u2019s democratic institutions and political foundation warrants our attention.\u201d Discussions on the bill are expected to resume in the legislature on Friday. Lai, 64, a former doctor and vice president, was inaugurated Monday alongside new Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim, who recently served as Taiwan\u2019s top envoy to the United States. Both leaders and their party are openly loathed by Beijing for championing Taiwan\u2019s sovereignty. China\u2019s ruling Communist Party says the self-ruling democracy is part of its territory, despite never having controlled it, and has vowed to take the island, by force if necessary.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/asia/taiwan-protest-parliament-reform-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_europe_french-macron-new-caledonia-intl-hnk", "text": "French President Emmanuel Macron is on his way to New Caledonia, a government official has said, after a week of deadly unrest in the Pacific archipelago. Macron was leaving Paris on Tuesday night and will \u201cset up a mission\u201d in the French territory, government spokesperson Prisca Thevenot told a press conference, without giving further details. He will be accompanied by Interior Minister G\u00e9rald Darmanin, Defense Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu, and Overseas Minister Marie Gu\u00e9venoux, Darmanin told the National Assembly. New Caledonia has been roiled by riots sparked by electoral changes from the national government. The unrest has killed at least six people, and has left a trail of burned cars and looted shops, with road barricades restricting access to medicine and food. The violence is the latest outburst of political tensions that have simmered for years and pitted the island\u2019s largely pro-independence indigenous Kanak communities \u2013\u00a0who have long chafed against rule by Paris \u2013 against French inhabitants opposed to breaking ties with their motherland. Macron\u2019s visit comes as Australia and New Zealand deploy government planes to evacuate their nationals from New Caledonia and as hundreds more French security personnel have been deployed to assist in the unrest. France\u2019s High Commission of New Caledonia said Tuesday the airport remains closed for commercial flights until May 25. Thevenot said Tuesday that 1,000 more members of French security forces have arrived in New Caledonia to support the 1,700 personnel already on the island. Darmanin also told the French legislature the number of police and gendarmes in New Caledonia would soon reach 3,000. Also speaking to France\u2019s National Assembly, Prime Minister Gabriel Attal said Tuesday \u201cthe situation is starting to improve.\u201d Protests began May 13 involving mostly young people, in response to the tabling of a vote in the French parliament proposing changes to New Caledonia\u2019s constitution that would give greater voting rights to French residents living on the islands. On Tuesday, legislators voted overwhelmingly in favor of the change. The proposed changes to the constitution add thousands of extra voters to New Caledonia\u2019s electoral rolls, which have not been updated since the late 1990s. Pro-independence groups say the changes are an attempt by France to consolidate its rule over the archipelago. Supporters of the change say voter rolls will better reflect the current population. Lying in the South Pacific with Australia, Fiji and Vanuatu for neighbors, New Caledonia is a semiautonomous French territory \u2014 one of a dozen scattered throughout the Pacific, Caribbean and Indian Ocean. Colonial France took control of New Caledonia in 1853. White settlement followed and the indigenous Kanak people were longtime victims of harsh segregation policies. Many indigenous inhabitants continue to live with high rates of poverty and high unemployment to this day.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/europe/french-macron-new-caledonia-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_middleeast_palestinian-statehood-spain-norway-ireland-intl", "text": "Ireland, Spain and Norway have announced plans to formally recognize a Palestinian state next week, in a move that is likely to bolster the global Palestinian cause but further strain relations between Europe and Israel. The three European nations say their landmark decision is the best way to achieve lasting peace in the Middle East, but it sparked swift condemnation from Israel, as its foreign minister ordered the immediate recall of its ambassadors from those countries. Most of the world already recognizes Palestinian statehood. More than 140 out of 193 member states of the United Nations have made their recognition official. But only some nations in the 27-member European Union are among them. Irish Prime Minister Simon Harris told a Wednesday news conference in Dublin: \u201cToday, Ireland, Norway and Spain are announcing that we recognize the state of Palestine. Each of us will now undertake whatever national steps are necessary to give effect to that decision.\u201d \u201cThere is never a wrong time to do the right thing,\u201d Harris later said, speaking to CNN\u2019s Christiana Amanpour on Thursday. \u201cIt was my government\u2019s preferred position to recognize a two-state solution as part of a peace process to bring that about, but sadly, unfortunately, such a comprehensive peace settlement now seems, in many ways, further away than it has ever been,\u201d Harris said. \u201cWe believe you can\u2019t say you\u2019re in favor of a two-state solution and not recognize the very existence of two states,\u201d he added. The recognition will come into force in all three countries on May 28, according to Irish Foreign Minister Miche\u00e1l Martin. Norway\u2019s\u00a0Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re said that a Palestinian state was \u201ca prerequisite for achieving peace in the Middle East.\u201d \u201cThere will be no peace in the Middle East without a two-state solution,\u201d St\u00f8re said in a statement. \u201cThere can be no two-state solution without a Palestinian state.\u201d Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez sought to characterize the decision as one that was not anti-Israel. \u201cThis recognition is not against the people of Israel and certainly not against the Jewish people,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not in favor of Hamas. It\u2019s in favor of co-existence.\u201d The announcement was welcomed by Palestinian officials. \u201cThis step reflects Spain\u2019s keenness to support the Palestinian people and their inalienable and legitimate rights to their land and homeland,\u201d the office of the president of the Palestinian Authority said in response to Madrid\u2019s decision, as reported by Palestinian news agency Wafa. Hamas, the militant group which governs Gaza, urged other countries to follow suit and \u201crecognize our legitimate national rights, support the struggle of our people for liberation and independence, and end the Zionist occupation of our land.\u201d But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said recognizing a Palestinian state would be a \u201creward for terror.\u201d \u201cThis will be a terror state, which will attempt to perpetrate the onslaught of October 7 time and again, and to that we shall not agree,\u201d Netanyahu said, adding, \u201cthis evil must not be given a state.\u201d As Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz ordered the immediate recall of its ambassadors to Spain, Norway and Ireland, he said, in a statement: \u201cI am sending a clear message today \u2014 Israel will not hold back against those who undermine its sovereignty and endanger its security.\u201d \u201cAfter the terrorist organization Hamas carried out the largest massacre of Jews since the Holocaust, after it committed the most horrific sex crimes the world has seen, these countries chose to give a reward to Hamas and Iran and recognize a Palestinian state,\u201d Katz added. Israel launched its military offensive in Gaza\u00a0on October 7\u00a0after militants led by Hamas killed at least 1,200 people and abducted more than 250 others. Israel has come under fierce criticism for its war. Earlier this month, a panel of independent UN experts condemned \u201cthe continued and systematic onslaught of violence committed against Palestinians in Gaza.\u201d The agency has repeatedly called for a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of hostages taken by Hamas. Israeli attacks\u00a0in\u00a0Gaza have since killed at least\u00a035,647\u00a0Palestinians and injured another\u00a079,852\u00a0people, according to the Ministry of Health there. CNN cannot independently confirm the figures. Two-state solution All three European leaders stressed the importance of having Palestinian statehood in reaching a two-state solution in the Middle East, a decades-long goal that the international community has failed to achieve. Ireland\u2019s Foreign Minister Martin said the decision came amid \u201cgrowing impatience\u201d with Israel\u2019s lack of political will for a two-state solution. \u201cThe integrity of that two-state solution has been undermined in recent years by the strategy of the Israeli government and, in particular, the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has declared opposition to it,\u201d Martin told CNN\u2019s Richard Quest during a live interview. Meanwhile, Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide told CNN\u2019s Becky Anderson that Israel was wrong to see recognizing Palestinian statehood as rewarding Hamas. \u201cWe are sending the opposite signal. We are supporting the Palestine authorities which spring out of the PLO [Palestine Liberation Organization] who renounce violence and who many decades ago promised to leave the violent struggle behind and work for peaceful settlement with Israel \u2014 a promise they have kept by the way,\u201d Eide said. Senior officials in the United States, a close ally of Israel, have insisted the only way to bring peace and stability to the region is through the creation of a Palestinian state with guarantees for Israel\u2019s security. Lawmakers in Israel have long rejected those calls. Reacting to the news on Wednesday, a National Security Council spokesperson told CNN that US President Joe Biden \u201cis a strong supporter\u201d of a two-state solution. The spokesperson added, however: \u201cHe believes a Palestinian state should be realized through direct negotiations between the parties, not through unilateral recognition.\u201d France, meanwhile, said that now is not the \u201cright time\u201d for it to join its European neighbors in recognizing a Palestinian state. The country\u2019s foreign minister, Stephane S\u00e9journe, added that such a decision is not merely a \u201csymbolic issue or a question of political positioning\u201d but rather a \u201cdiplomatic tool\u201d in the service of a two-state solution. Germany, another one of Israel\u2019s staunchest allies, also questioned the decision. Michael Roth, the chair of the parliament\u2019s\u00a0Foreign Affairs Committee, posted on X: \u201cI\u2019m not convinced that the recognition of Palestine as a sovereign state is an appropriate measure after the horrific massacres (by) Hamas (on) October 7 last year.\u201d Qatar, a key mediator in stalled ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas, said it hopes \u201cfor more countries to recognize the State of Palestine,\u201d according to a statement from the foreign ministry. The foreign ministry of Saudi Arabia, another regional actor, called on \u201cmore countries to swiftly take the same stance.\u201d Ireland has a long history of being openly supportive of the Palestinian cause, consistently criticizing Israeli policies in the occupied West Bank and Gaza before Hamas\u2019 October 7 attack in Israel. Since then, Israel\u2019s war in response has shredded huge parts of the Gaza Strip and drained critical supplies, exposing the entire population of more than 2.2 million people to the risk of famine. \u201cI can say this to the people of Israel: we recognize the state of Israel. We recognize the state of Israel\u2019s right to live in peace and security. That is their right. The people of Palestine also must have an equivalent right to peace and security,\u201d Harris told Amanpour on Thursday. \u201cAnd let me also say this to the people of Israel: the Irish people know what it\u2019s like to have their national identity hijacked by a terrorist organization. The IRA was never the people of Ireland and Hamas is not the people of Palestine.\u201d \u201cWe have been clear and unequivocal that we condemn Hamas, that we condemn the most horrific barbaric massacre that Israel experienced on the 7th\u00a0of October. We call for the unconditional and immediate release of all hostages. But it is entirely possible to say what I have just said and also say the next bit which sadly some refuse to say: that what is happening in Palestine, what is happening in Gaza is a humanitarian catastrophe, that children are being starved, are being deprived of food and that there are children who will go to sleep in Gaza tonight not sure if they will wake in the morning,\u201d he added. A source familiar with the matter told CNN the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs is currently considering further diplomatic steps against the three countries. Steps under consideration include cancelling visits of officials from these countries to Israel and revoking visas from diplomats, which will limit their ability to visit areas in the West Bank under control of the Palestinian Authority, the source said. Another step under consideration by Israel is to reach out to the US to seek diplomatic support in providing clarification from Norway, Ireland and Spain on their intended decision, and to ask the US to try and convince other countries to not follow suit. Pressure on Israel The planned recognition adds pressure on Israel after seven months of fighting, according to H.A. Hellyer, scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the Royal United Services Institute for Defence and Security Studies in London. \u201cFor individual Palestinians on the ground in the Occupied Territories, it\u2019s not going to mean anything at all in the short term, perhaps in the medium term,\u201d Hellyer told CNN. \u201cIt is obviously political recognition by states that don\u2019t have a presence on the ground.\u201d Hellyer added that Israel risks becoming an \u201cinternational pariah\u201d given that Western nations are now beginning to recognize a Palestinian state.  Israel captured Gaza from Egypt in the 1967 war, then withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005. The territory, home to some 2 million Palestinians, fell under Hamas\u2019 rule in 2007. After Hamas took control, Israel and Egypt imposed a strict siege on the territory, which is ongoing. Israel also maintains an air and naval blockade on Gaza. These severe restrictions have been fiercely criticized by international bodies, including Amnesty International,\u00a0who say\u00a0Israel has violated international law. The vast majority of the population in Gaza are descendants of 700,000 Palestinians who fled or were\u00a0forcibly expelled\u00a0from their homes during what Palestinians call\u00a0al-Nakba, or \u201cthe catastrophe,\u201d of the 1948-49 war, in what is now Israel.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/middleeast/palestinian-statehood-spain-norway-ireland-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_05_21_middleeast_israel-netanyahu-interview-icc-intl-latam", "text": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denied allegations that he was starving Palestinians in Gaza as a method of war in an interview with CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on Tuesday, saying an arrest warrant application currently under review in the International Criminal Court (ICC) is based on a \u201cpack of lies.\u201d ICC prosecutor Karim Khan announced Monday that he had requested arrest warrants for three Hamas leaders and two Israeli politicians \u2013 Netanyahu and Israel\u2019s Defense Minister Yoav Gallant \u2013 on allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity over the October 7 attacks in Israel and the subsequent war in Gaza. Khan said the accusations against Netanyahu and Gallant include \u201ccausing extermination, causing starvation as a method of war, including the denial of humanitarian relief supplies, deliberately targeting civilians in conflict.\u201d Speaking to Tapper, Netanyahu called Khan a \u201crogue prosecutor that has put false charges and created false symmetries that are both dangerous and false\u201d and insisted that Israel has been allowing food and medical aid to enter Gaza, where aid groups say that the blockaded Palestinian enclave is currently at risk of famine. Israel has allowed 20,000 trucks of aid into Gaza, Netanyahu said \u2013 a fraction of what would have entered in the same period under normal times. Israel\u2019s ongoing siege of Gaza, following Hamas\u2019 October 7 terror attacks, has reached its seventh month and left more than 34,000 people dead. Serious questions about the Israeli military\u2019s long-term strategy have been raised both inside and outside of Israel after the Israeli military sent troops back into areas of northern Gaza, an area it had previously declared clear of Hamas. Last week, Israel\u2019s defense chief Gallant\u00a0called on Netanyahu\u00a0to publicly rule out Israeli governance over the Gaza Strip and to lay out his\u00a0post-war plans for civilian rule in Gaza, warning that he opposes Israeli rule in the Palestinian enclave. When Netanyahu was asked by Tapper if he would rule out the Israeli occupation of Gaza, the Israeli politician said that \u201cresettling\u201d the Palestinian territory was out of the question. \u201cYou mean resettling Gaza? Yeah. It was never in the cards, and I said so openly [and] some of my constituents are not happy about it, but that\u2019s my position.\u201d The prime minister also reaffirmed his commitment to eradicating Hamas, which governs Gaza, before considering demilitarizing the Strip, in the interview. With more than 100 hostages still believed to be held in Gaza, pressure has been growing for a deal that would see hostages released in exchange for a ceasefire. But when asked about public polling showing that a majority of Israelis believe freeing hostages is a higher priority than military action, Netanyahu said you could not have one without the other. \u201cMilitary action that we take against Hamas is in fact the way to get these hostages because without military pressure, basically, without, you know, squeezing them, Hamas is not going to give up anything,\u201d he told Tapper. Netanyahu is deeply unpopular in Israel, where he is also facing an ongoing corruption trial. Critics have accused the Prime Minister of being beholden to members of his far-right coalition and prolonging the war to maintain his grip on power. Speaking to Tapper, Netanyahu rejected accusations that he avoids Israeli media in favor of international press, saying he has done up to 20 press conferences with Israeli journalists. \u201cThat\u2019s simply not true,\u201d he said. \u201cI speak to them and I speak to you and I welcome the opportunity to tell the truth and dispel the lies in both in both mediums.\u201d \u2018No equivalence\u2019 The ICC\u2019s application for warrants over the war in Gaza marked the first time the international court has targeted the top leader of a close ally of the United States. Israel and the US are not members of the ICC, but the court\u00a0has said that it\u00a0has\u00a0jurisdiction over Gaza, East Jerusalem, and the West Bank after Palestinian leaders formally agreed to be bound by the court\u2019s founding principles in 2015. A panel of ICC judges will now consider Khan\u2019s application for the arrest warrants. An ICC warrant would compel more than 100 member-nations of the court to arrest Netanyahu if he traveled in their territory. France was among the countries that have supported the ICC decision alongside international rights groups. Human rights organization Amnesty International has\u00a0hailed the arrest warrant request as a\u00a0\u201ccrucial step towards justice.\u201d But Israel\u2019s allies have roundly condemned\u00a0Khan\u2019s\u00a0move, with US President Joe Biden calling it \u201coutrageous.\u201d\u00a0\u201cThere is no equivalence - none - between Israel and Hamas,\u201d\u00a0Biden said.\u00a0\u00a0Several US lawmakers have threatened to levy sanctions against the ICC, and\u00a0Secretary of State Antony\u00a0Blinken\u00a0has said\u00a0he is open to legislative action against the court. The\u00a0Biden administration said earlier this month\u00a0that\u00a0it is \u201creasonable to assess\u201d that US weapons have been used by Israeli forces in\u00a0Gaza\u00a0in ways that are \u201cinconsistent\u201d with international humanitarian law \u2013 but\u00a0stopped short of officially saying Israel violated the law. Speaking to Tapper, Netanyahu likened himself to President Franklin Roosevelt, claiming the arrest warrants were like putting Nazi leader Adolf Hitler on the docks alongside the American wartime president who oversaw the US\u2019s mobilization\u00a0during World War\u00a0II. Khan previously told CNN\u2019s Christiane Amanpour that he had received international pressure over his investigation of Israel. \u201cThis court is built for Africa and for thugs like [Russian President Vladimir] Putin,\u201d Khan described one senior leader telling him.

{"id": "2024_05_22_style_bmw-art-car-julie-mehretu", "text": "Over the past 50 years, artists including Andy Warhol, Jeff Koons, Jenny Holzer and Robert Rauschenberg have been chosen by the luxury car company to use a BMW as their canvas, each adorning one of the famous BMW Art Cars in their signature style. Ethiopian American artist Julie Mehretu, known for her work in abstract painting, was chosen last year to create the company\u2019s newest \u2018Art Car.\u2019 Her artwork, painted on a BMW M Hybrid V8, was recently unveiled at the Pompidou Center in Paris and will be on the track at the 24 Hours of Le Mans race next month. The BMW M Hybrid V8, a plug-in hybrid, is a track-only racing car created to compete in the international endurance racing circuit. Designed and engineered in collaboration with the Italian race car manufacturer Dallara, it\u2019s low and wide with an enormous rear wing and a large vertical rudder. For the commission, which marks the 20th BMW Art Car, Mehretu chose to adapt one of her most famous works: The painting \u201cEverywhen,\u201d which is now in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. The painting \u2014 and the car \u2014 are covered in broad washes color cut through with broad black streaks and lines. \u201cIn the studio where I had the model of the BMW M Hybrid V8 I was just sitting in front of the painting and I thought: What would happen if this car seemed to go through that painting and becomes affected by it,\u201d Mehretu said in a statement. \u201cThe idea was to make a remix, a mash-up of the painting. I kept seeing that painting kind of dripping into the car.\u201d The first BMW Art Car was painted in 1975 by the American sculptor Alexander Calder after French racing driver Herv\u00e9 Poulain\u00a0brought the idea to BMW. Poulain drove the Calder-painted BMW 3.0 CSL at Le Mans that year. In 1977, Roy Lichtenstein covered a BMW 320 Group 5 in the graphic stripes and dots he was renowned for; Warhol painted a BMW M1 in 1979 with textured, pastel brushstrokes. The first woman to take on a BMW Art Car was South African artist Esther Mahlangu, who in 1991 painted a 525i sedan. In 1996, Holzer covered a BMW Le Mans race car in the words \u201cProtect Me From What I Want,\u201d among other provocative phrases. Mehretu\u2019s practice frequently draws inspiration from architecture and busy urban settings, featuring intricate juxtapositions of lines and shapes \u2014 inspired by technical drawings and building plans \u2014 and, sometimes, splashes of color or deep darkness. Her work has also addressed themes such as migration, colonialization and globalization. Critics often highlight the sense of humanity apparent in her innovative, abstract works. There\u2019s movement and complex emotion. Mehretu is best known for large-scale pieces, like an eighty-foot-long mural she created for the lobby of the Goldman Sachs building in Manhattan. It\u2019s busy and bright with colored shapes overlaying dark straight lines; the red, yellow, blue and green forms appear to be actively shooting out across the huge wall. Other works, like \u201cMogama (A Painting in 4 Parts),\u201d are grayer and more pensive but retain a soft, rippling sense of motion.

Mehretu was born in 1970 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia to an Ethiopian father and an American mother. Seven years later, the family moved to the United States to escape a brutal civil war then-raging in the country. In 1997, she earned a Masters of Fine Arts from the Rhode Island School of Design; she is currently based in New York. She has received widespread acclaim for her work, and prestigious awards including a MacArthur Fellowship in 2005 and, in 2015, a US Department of State Medal of Arts Award. She was unanimously selected for this project by a jury of prominent gallery and museum directors. Madeleine Grynsztejn, Pritzker Director at the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago and a member of that jury, described Mehretu as the \u201cperfect artist\u201d to take on the BMW Art Car in a statement released last June announcing her selection. \u201cFor years, Julie has painted speed and for a long time worked very successfully at scale,\u201d Grynsztejn said. \u201cTo merge her work with the shape and form of a speeding vehicle is really an alignment of perfection.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/style/bmw-art-car-julie-mehretu/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "world"}}

The delegation is expected to assess this week whether equipment and facilities for the foreign police forces are ready \u2014 an assessment which will be decisive in determining a timeline for the deployment, a source with knowledge of the preparations told CNN. Members of the delegation are also expected to meet with US and United Nations officials in the country, sources said. The UN Security Council\u00a0last year\u00a0authorized a multinational mission to support Haiti\u2019s National Police in battling deadly gangs that have seized control of much of the capital Port-au-Prince. Despite strong support from the US and other regional powers, however, the mission has been mired in uncertainty and legal challenges for months. It was further delayed following the resignation of former Haitian Prime Minister Ariel Henry in March, until the creation of a transitional governing council. The council said Tuesday that it met with top Haitian police brass to discuss the multinational mission. \u201cHaiti, through the Haitian National Police, will have overall control of all aspects of the field mission,\u201d including the mission\u2019s composition, aims, rules of engagement and health precautions, it emphasized in a statement on X. Kenya is currently finalizing preparations for the mission, the country\u2019s principal secretary of foreign affairs\u00a0Korir Sing\u2019Oei said Sunday, citing the successful creation of the council and other institutions in Haiti as key conditions. \u201cIn view of that and in view of the decision of the courts in our republic essentially guiding how Kenya should be able to carry out this deployment, lots of reciprocal agreements were entered into between Kenya and Haiti, which facilitates Kenya\u2019s ability to deploy. And we are in the process \u2014 our government is in the process of finalizing preparation to deploy.\u201d The mission is scheduled to launch by the end of this month. A UN-managed trust fund for the mission currently contains $21 million, provided by Canada ($8.7 million), France ($3.2 million), Spain ($3 million) and the United States ($6 million). Personnel for the mission have been offered by the Bahamas, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belize, Benin, Chad and Jamaica, in addition to Kenya. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Tuesday defended US funding for the mission in a Senate Foreign Relations hearing, warning that Haiti is \u201con the precipice of becoming an all-out failed state\u201d without international support. \u201cI understand some of the skepticism that exists about another mission in Haiti, but I think what we have going for us is this: first, a general revulsion of the people at the direction that the country has taken, including gangs that are dominating Port-au-Price and trying to undermine governance, a democratic trajectory that\u2019s been disrupted by failing to have a government that actually has a clear mandate and all of that has also had the effect of interrupting development assistance, other forms of assistance that people so desperately need,\u201d he said. Haiti\u2019s National Police have already \u201ctaken back control of the airport and other critical infrastructure,\u201d he added. \u201cIn fact, today, commercial flights resumed in Haiti, and we anticipate that American carriers will begin flying again in the days ahead.\u201d US President Joe Biden will welcome Kenyan President William\u00a0Ruto and first lady Rachel\u00a0Ruto\u00a0to the White House on Thursday, with Haiti high on the expected agenda.

The three-time Super Bowl-winning quarterback Mahomes told reporters that Butker is a \u201cgood person\u201d despite \u201cnot necessarily agreeing\u201d with his comments, which were made in an address to graduates at Benedictine College, a small Catholic school in Atchison, Kansas. \u201cI\u2019ve known him for seven years,\u201d the two-time NFL MVP said after the team\u2019s organized team activities (OTA\u2019s). \u201cI judge him by the character that he shows every single day \u2026 that\u2019s someone who cares about the people around him, cares about his family and wants to make a good impact in society.\u201d Mahomes said that in a locker room, he encounters people from different backgrounds, with different views. \u201cWe\u2019re not always going to agree, there are certain things that he said that I don\u2019t necessarily agree with but I understand the person that he is and he\u2019s trying to do whatever he can to lead people in the right direction,\u201d he said. Big names distance themselves from speech In his speech, Butker bemoaned diversity and equity initiatives to about 485 male and female graduates, as well as suggesting that women find more fulfillment through getting married and having children than by pursuing careers \u2013 directly after quoting a song by Taylor Swift. Mahomes, 28, reiterated that he didn\u2019t \u201cnecessarily agree\u201d with what was said when asked what part of Butker\u2019s speech he disagreed with. \u201cI\u2019m not going to judge him by that, I judge him by the way he acts every single day. I\u2019m not going to get into the full details of the entire speech,\u201d Mahomes added. \u201cAt the same time, I know what type of person he is and I\u2019m going to make sure I look at that first and let the other stuff handle itself.\u201d Chiefs head coach Andy Reid said he talks to Butker \u201call the time\u201d but did not address the speech with him. \u201cWe\u2019re a microcosm of life here,\u201d Reid said. \u201cEverybody is from different areas, different religions, different races and we all get along. We all respect each other\u2019s opinions, and not necessarily do we go by those but we respect everybody to have a voice. Reid added that he didn\u2019t think \u201che was speaking ill to women. He has his opinions, and we all respect that.\u201d After the conclusion of the National Football League\u2019s (NFL) Spring League Meeting in Nashville, league commissioner Roger Goodell was asked about Butker\u2019s comments at his usual post-meeting press conference Wednesday. \u201cWe have over 3,000 players. We have executives around the league.\u00a0 They have diversity of opinions and thoughts just like America does,\u201d Goodell said \u201cI think that\u2019s something that we treasure and that\u2019s part of, I think, ultimately what makes us as a society better.\u201d The NFL had previously distanced itself from the speech, saying Butker\u2019s comments don\u2019t reflect the views of the league. \u201cHarrison Butker gave a speech in his personal capacity. His views are not those of the NFL as an organization,\u201d said senior vice president Jonathan Beane, the league\u2019s chief diversity and inclusion officer. \u201cThe NFL is steadfast in our commitment to inclusion, which only makes our league stronger.\u201d The 28-year-old Butker, who is entering his eighth season in the league, did not address the media on Wednesday.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/sport/patrick-mahomes-defends-harrison-butker-after-speech-intl-spt/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "world"}}

Zourabichvili had previously\u00a0vowed to torpedo the bill, but her veto could still be overruled by a simple majority in parliament, which approved the bill on Tuesday with 84 lawmakers voting in favor and 30 against. The divisive legislation would require organizations receiving more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as \u201cagents of foreign influence\u201d or face a fine. Opponents say the bill was modeled after similar laws in Russia that the Kremlin has used to snuff out opposition and civil society. \u201cThis law, in its essence and spirit, is fundamentally Russian, contradicting our constitution and all European standards,\u201d President Zourabichvili said after vetoing the bill on Saturday. She said the bill must be repealed, suggesting it could prevent the country from joining the European Union. The EU had given similar warnings.

Georgia\u2019s stance towards Russia is decidedly mixed.

{"id": "2024_05_23_sport_ncaa-settlement", "text": "The National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA) and the five power conferences have agreed to settlement terms to pave the way to allow schools to pay student-athletes, the governing body for college sports along with the power conference commissioners\u00a0announced\u00a0on Thursday. \u201cThe five autonomy conferences and the NCAA agreeing to settlement terms is an important step in the continuing reform of college sports that will provide benefits to student-athletes and provide clarity in college athletics across all divisions for years to come,\u201d the statement read. \u201cThis settlement is also a road map for college sports leaders and Congress to ensure this uniquely American institution can continue to provide unmatched opportunity for millions of students. All of Division I made today\u2019s progress possible, and we all have work to do to implement the terms of the agreement as the legal process continues. We look forward to working with our various student-athlete leadership groups to write the next chapter of college sports.\u201d The settlement represents a turning point in college athletics, which have traditionally competed under the guise of amateurism that allowed a seedy underbelly of hidden payments and compensation to flourish. Untold numbers of college sports programs have been punished by the NCAA for their players being compensated in some way for their exploits on the field \u2013 from thousands of dollars being paid to star players under the table to a coach buying a recruit a hamburger on a visit. As the business of college sports took off, the veil of amateurism had begun to seem absurd to many observers: Schools and conferences began raking in millions upon millions of dollars, coaches were preaching austerity and amateurism before leaving their players to take a new job with a massive pay raise and TV networks helped reshape the landscape of the sport to maximize their own profits. At the same time, the players on the field were being paid nothing even though they were the ones playing in the games that drove what had become a multibillion-dollar industry. The House vs. NCAA lawsuit sought to change that. Filed by Grant House and Sedona Prince, two college athletes, against the NCAA and the Power 5 conferences \u2013 the Pac-12, Big Ten, Big 12, Southeastern and Atlantic Coast \u2013 the lawsuit focused on the eight-year, $8.8 billion extension the NCAA signed to broadcast coverage of the March Madness basketball tournament, as well as seeking back-dated damages for payments the suit calls wrongly withheld. While an NCAA rule change allowed for players to be paid for the use of their name, image and likeness, often through sponsorships and advertisements, the suit argued the NCAA restricts how much student athletes can earn outside employment. For example, the suit says one NCAA bylaw, regulating jobs athletes can hold at their universities,\u00a0\u201cspecifically prohibits athletes from receiving \u2018any remuneration for value or utility that the student-athlete may have for the (outside) employer because of the publicity, reputation, fame or personal following that he or she has obtained because of athletics ability.\u201d In a joint statement, the leaders of the five conferences and the NCAA said they hoped that the settlement could be an important moment in the reform of the college sports world. \u201cThis settlement is also a road map for college sports leaders and Congress to ensure this uniquely American institution can continue to provide unmatched opportunity for millions of students. All of Division I made today\u2019s progress possible, and we all have work to do to implement the terms of the agreement as the legal process continues. We look forward to working with our various student-athlete leadership groups to write the next chapter of college sports,\u201d read the statement, which was attributed to NCAA President Charlie Baker, ACC Commissioner Jim Phillips, Big Ten Commissioner Tony Petitti, Big 12 Commissioner Brett Yormark, Pac-12 Commissioner Teresa Gould and SEC Commissioner Greg Sankey. While it\u2019s unclear what immediate effect the settlement will have on college sports, it\u2019s been clear for some time that a reckoning was coming \u2014 particularly in the wake of the rule change around NIL compensation in 2021. That rule change, combined with a softening of the transfer rules, have led to players bouncing from school to school in search of a better NIL deal when in the past they would be forced to stay at their original school for their four years of eligibility or risk sitting out a year following a transfer. Athletes\u2019 increased use of the transfer portal, the commissioners said, has become problematic in college sports, particularly for student-athletes\u2019 quest to get a degree. They said college boosters have taken advantage of the current patchwork of laws to help their universities recruit the top athletes by promising big paydays \u2014 to the detriment of colleges in other states that are forced to play by a different set of rules. The lack of regulation around NIL has made for a sort of Wild West atmosphere in college sports that the NCAA will now hope to curtail in some way.

{"id": "travel_theresa-claiborne-first-black-woman-air-force-pilot-retirement", "text": "She\u2019s been flying planes, both military and commercial, for about 43 years, breaking down barrier after barrier along the way. But on May 23, Captain Theresa Claiborne will land her \u201cfinal flight\u201d at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey after traveling from Lisbon, Portugal, with her friends and family in tow. \u201cI\u2019ve had a great career,\u201d Claiborne told CNN Travel via Zoom shortly before setting off for Lisbon. \u201cAnd it\u2019s time for me to park the brakes for the final time on a big airplane.\u201d Retirement flight While she\u2019s looking forward to \u201cclosing that one chapter and starting another,\u201d Claiborne can\u2019t help but get a \u201clittle teary\u201d when she thinks of the \u201cwide-eyed\u201d children who often marvel at her as she strides through an airport in her pilot uniform. \u201cAfter this, walking through the airport, I won\u2019t have a uniform on,\u201d Claiborne says. \u201cPeople will just look at me like I\u2019m just a passenger like everyone else, that\u2019ll be a little different\u2026 I\u2019m hoping that I can still make an impact on the industry. \u201cTo still impart that knowledge on young people, and particularly young black women, that they can do this.\u201d Becoming a pilot was something Claiborne, originally from Virginia, could never have imagined for herself as a young girl. She was about seven years old when she took her first flight \u2013 an international jaunt to Turkey. \u201cMy father was military,\u201d she says. \u201cSo I grew up really all over the world\u2026 I\u2019d been on big airplanes before but never dreamt of flying one.\u201d That all changed when Claiborne joined the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFROTC) during college and was given the opportunity to fly in a T-37, a twin-engine jet trainer. \u201cOnce I got that first taste of being in the air and being in command of the airplane, I was like, \u2018Yeah, this is what I\u2019m going to do,\u201d says Claiborne, who was about 20 at the time. Sink or swim While she was keen to apply for undergraduate pilot training, Claiborne explains that the US Air Force was only training 10 women a year at the time and \u201chad already selected the women for my graduating class.\u201d However, this number soon increased, and Claiborne jumped at the opportunity to earn her pilot wings. Around six months after graduating from California State University in Sacramento she began pilot training. \u201cIt\u2019s sink or swim\u2026 Either you make it or you don\u2019t,\u201d she says, pointing out that she found it particularly difficult at first as \u201cshe didn\u2019t have a strong math background.\u201d \u201cI just beared down and made sure that I made it, because that\u2019s the kind of personality I have.\u201d In 1981, Claiborne was commissioned as a second lieutenant and went on to become the first Black woman to fly in the US Air Force the following year. \u201cI did not know until a few weeks before I graduated that that was the case,\u201d she says of the \u201cmind boggling\u201d title. \u201cAnd I often say that I\u2019m really, really happy that I didn\u2019t know. I was 22 years old\u2026\u201d During her years in the US Air Force, Caliborne became the first Black woman to serve as a command pilot and instructor for the KC-135, a mid-air refueling jet. New heights In 1990, she joined United Airlines as a flight officer. At five feet, two inches, Claiborne was two inches shorter than the height required to fly commercial aircraft at other airlines at the time, but she would go on to be a United Airlines captain. When asked about the transition to flying commercial planes, Claiborne stresses that \u201ca pilot is a pilot.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re in different type organizations, but you\u2019re still a pilot,\u201d she adds. Claiborne says she has always prided herself on being the best pilot that she could possibly be, stressing that a big part of this is ensuring that her passengers enjoy the flying experience. \u201cBeing good means that I\u2019m communicating with my passengers at all times,\u201d she says. \u201cThey know what\u2019s going on. That I keep them safe in every way. \u201cObviously, the landing is all-important. I\u2019ve got two more to do really well on.\u201d \u201cI still get chills when I think about the fact that I was the first, and had I not graduated, the statement that that may have made.\u201d Claiborne has chosen Newark, New Jersey, to Lisbon (outbound and inbound) as her swan song, with her mother, along with many of her closest friends and family, coming along for the ride. \u201cI won\u2019t lie, I wanted to go to Paris,\u201d she admits, explaining that she was keen to pay tribute to Bessie Coleman, who moved to Paris to attend aviation school and went on to become the first African-American woman to earn a pilot\u2019s license. \u201cI wanted to recreate the whole Bessie Coleman thing. But Paris out of Newark is on a different airframe.\u201d She eventually decided on the Portuguese capital, largely because there\u2019s a two-day layover on the service, which means that she\u2019ll be able to spend some time enjoying the city with her loved ones. \u201cGenerally, we\u2019re there [at the outbound destination] for 24 hours. So you land, you nap, you find something to eat, you nap again, and you leave. \u201cSo this way, with the Lisbon trip, we have an opportunity to enjoy each other. \u201cAnd my mother\u2019s made many, many, many sacrifices for me. So this is an opportunity for her to really enjoy herself.\u201d Increasing diversity Once she\u2019s landed the United Airlines 787 Dreamliner in Newark, Claiborne will receive the water cannon salute \u2013 a mark of respect that sees two fire engines use their water cannons to create a huge arc over a plane. \u201cThat\u2019s something that retiring people look forward to,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty special.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a pretty emotional person,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m hoping I don\u2019t cry. But I probably will have a few tears. \u201cBecause after all, it\u2019ll be the last time that I\u2019m piloting a big airplane like that.\u201d Claiborne has spent her entire commercial flying career at United Airlines and says she feels blessed to have been able to work for the American airline for so long. \u201cIt\u2019s a good company,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have the most women pilots of any major United States carrier, and I believe we still have the most Black women.\u201d In the US, 93.7% of professional pilots are White and 92.5% of professional pilots are male, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. It\u2019s estimated that there are less than 150 Black women pilots in the US, and Claiborne feels a huge responsibility as one of them. \u201cI do carry the weight on my shoulders of making sure that I continue to perform in a way that other people who look like me get a fair chance,\u201d she says, before recounting how crew members would sometimes assume her co-pilot was the captain earlier in her career. \u201cAfter they\u2019d finished talking, I\u2019d turn around and look and go, \u2018What you got for me?\u2019\u201d she recalls. Claiborne is currently the president of Sisters of the Skies, a not-for-profit organization focused on helping increase the number of Black women pilots, which awards scholarships to \u201cwomen who are able, and who want to be pilots.\u201d Claiborne admits that watching the curtain close on her hugely successful career will be a \u201cbittersweet\u201d experience. \u201cThe biggest barrier to flying an airplane is the money,\u201d she explains, referring to the cost of pilot training\ufeff. \u201cSo that\u2019s what we do.\u201d Claiborne will be stepping down as president of the organization after seven years, but she plans to continue mentoring young girls long into her retirement, as well as write \u201ca couple books.\u201d \u201cThere are a group of women coming up behind me who are members of our organization that are carrying on that legacy,\u201d she adds. While this may be the end of her commercial flying career, Claiborne isn\u2019t necessarily saying \u201cgoodbye\u201d to piloting forever, and would love to fly a World War II aircraft one day. \u201cI\u2019ve had friends that said, \u2018Come on. I\u2019ll take you up.\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cSo I could see myself doing that. That\u2019s on my bucket list too. \u201cI would absolutely love to fly in a Red Tail, an airplane that the Tuskegee Airmen flew. That would probably be my number one. \u201cIf somebody is offering a ride in the backseat of a Thunderbird, I might as well put that out there.

The unanimous ruling capped months long speculation and legal wrangling on whether the former leader of the ruling African National Congress (ANC), turned thorn in its side and public face of a rival party, would be able to stand for the country\u2019s top legislative body. Zuma was forced to resign as president in 2018 after a series of corruption scandals and internal infighting in the ANC. He was found guilty of contempt of court by the same constitutional court for his refusal to testify to an anti-corruption commission. It is that sentence that barred him from running, the court ruled on Monday. \u201c(Zuma) Is accordingly not eligible to be a member of and not qualified to stand for election to the national assembly until five years have elapsed since the completion of his sentence,\u201d read Justice Leona Theron. \u201cWe welcomed the judgement, and we think it is well reasoned. A contempt of court sentence is an extremely important sentence, and it is a sentence that cannot be treated lightly. The constitutional court has reaffirmed this,\u201d said Neeshan Balton, of the Ahmed Kathrada foundation on local television.

The vote on May 29th could be the sternest test yet for the party of Nelson Mandela with scores of opposition parties vying for ballots. Many analysts believe that the party\u2019s majority is under threat. While the court ruled that Zuma is not eligible to run for MP, his party will still contest the election and his face will remain on the ballot. Nhlamulo Ndhlela, a party leader of uMkhonto WeSizwe, told CNN the court is biased against the former president and they plan to continue campaigning. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t change President Zuma being on the ballot and it doesn\u2019t stop him from leading the party,\u201d Ndhlela said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/africa/jacob-zuma-not-eligible-for-parliament-south-africas-top-court-says-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "world"}}

The photograph, taken in 2008 by the late British photographer Tim Hetherington, is from a time when nearly a fifth of all combat in Afghanistan was taking place in the six-mile valley. In the long stretches of boredom that would arise when the enemy was nowhere to be found, the men had to find other things to do at their remote outpost. \u201cThese guys are tough, aggressive guys and when there wasn\u2019t any combat, they turned their aggression on each other \u2014 in a fraternal way,\u201d explained Sebastian Junger, a writer and journalist who first brought Hetherington to Afghanistan on an assignment for Vanity Fair magazine in 2007. Both Hetherington and Junger became \u201cenamoured with the opportunity to show the intimacy of a platoon in combat,\u201d Junger said in an interview via telephone. The pair went on to co-direct what would become the Oscar-nominated documentary \u201cRestrepo\u201d filmed over the course of the same platoon\u2019s deployment. Bobby, the soldier on the bottom of this image, is remembered by Junger as \u201cincredibly funny, extremely smart.\u201d On top is Cortez, \u201can incredibly sweet kid,\u201d said Junger, adding that he was \u201csort of the pretty boy in the platoon.\u201d The photograph is currently on display at London\u2019s Imperial War Museum (IWM), accompanied by an excerpt from Hetherington\u2019s journal written that same year: \u201cIn the end it has little to do with the war, and a lot to do with being men\u2026 Or in the case here, becoming men.\u201d The works form part of an exhibition called \u201cStoryteller: Photography by Tim Hetherington,\u201d which opened on the 13th anniversary of the photographer\u2019s death (he was killed by shrapnel while filming and photographing the Libyan Civil War in April 2011). Junger agrees with his friend\u2019s sentiment. \u201cOne of the things that place is very good at is turning children into men. And I think that\u2019s always been true of war.\u201d Young men in conflict \u201cThe experience of war was the only opportunity that men had in a society to express unconditional love for each other,\u201d is a quote that Hetherington often repeated, according to his friends. He first learned it from another friend, photographer James Brabazon while the pair waited with Liberian rebel forces who were going to attack the capital Monrovia, during the Liberian Civil War in 2003. It was Hetherington\u2019s first experience of combat. Brabazon first heard the saying from his grandfather, a British soldier who served in World War II. \u201cHe just clearly, really took it to heart,\u201d said Brabazon in a video interview with CNN. \u201cTim was really interested in the dynamics of young men\u2026 He was really interested in how young men related to one another, how they represented one another to each other, where those representations came from, how they were amplified and how they were perpetuated \u2014 particularly in conflict.\u201d In a remote outpost where society was \u201cstripped away,\u201d these bonds captured Hetherington\u2019s attention more than the war itself. \u201cI became much more interested in the inter-relationships between the soldiers and my own relationship to the soldiers than I was in the fighting,\u201d reads a quote from Hetherington in the exhibition.\u00a0\u201cMy examination of young men and violence, or of young men\u2026 It\u2019s as much a journey about my own identity as it is about those young soldiers,\u201d he wrote. Following his year in the Korengal, Hetherington published \u201cInfidel,\u201d a photography book of stills taken during his deployment with bits of commentary from himself and the US soldiers he was embedded with. One contributor is Cortez, one of the subjects of the photo, who wrote: \u201cI told them time and time again that if a grenade went off, I would actually throw myself on the grenade\u2026 Because I actually love my brothers. I mean, it is a brotherhood\u2026 I think any of them would do it for me also.\u201d \u2018It\u2019s very important that this work happened\u2019 The IWM, which holds the entire archive of Hetherington\u2019s work, worked with researchers and different communities to find out how they engaged with conflict photography. Greg Brockett, who curated the exhibition, was especially interested in how refugee communities would respond to Hetherington\u2019s work. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to say how people are going to respond\u2026 Because a lot of them have experienced war and conflict directly,\u201d he told CNN over a video interview.\u00a0\u201cWhat struck me was there was generally an overwhelming sense of people who felt it\u2019s very important that this work happened, and people were able to see the realities they experience.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m less interested in people taking away knowledge of Tim, I\u2019m more interested in people taking inspiration away from Tim,\u201d said Stephen Mayes, executive director of the Tim Hetherington Trust, who also spoke to CNN via video call. Hetherington was distinguished from other conflict photographers by his approach, which involved spending prolonged periods of time with his subjects. He often used film cameras and would speak to his subjects while photographing them. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t interested in photography in and of itself, for its own sake. He was interested in how that would allow him to access the lives of others,\u201d said Brabazon. \u2018It took a little bit from his soul\u2019 In this process, Hetherington worried about how photography could be extractive. \u201cHe wanted the process to be consensual and also to leave something in the community,\u201d added Brabazon, recounting a series of street photographs Hetherington took in Liberia where he would take photographs of people, keeping one Polaroid for himself and giving another to the subject. \u201cI think that was really important, because it allowed people to have agency in the work that was being created\u2026 It\u2019s about extending the courtesy of participation in the creation of the work to the subject themselves.\u201d Hetherington\u2019s friends reflect on the tragedy of his death in Libya, believing he was killed in his prime as a photographer \u2014 not only because of the images he produced, but because of his reflections on what it meant to capture conflict. Mayes mentions the old adage that making a picture takes a little piece of the subject\u2019s soul. \u201cTim thought, definitely, in his mind, he\u2019d sold his soul to the devil in a way, because he saw that in making every picture he made, it took a little bit from his soul.\u201d \u201cWhat did Tim want the effect of his work to be? That is a question which I don\u2019t think we will every really know the answer to, because he died in the process of working that out himself,\u201d Brabazon explained. In his final diary entry on April 19, 2011, Hetherington wrote about attending the funeral of a rebel fighter who was killed by a mortar. He wrote of the young men he met there: \u201cThey are grimily happy that we are here to help them. They feel that now the whole world can see.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/style/tim-hetherington-photography-snap/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_21_sport_individual-neutral-athlete-olympics-explainer-spt-intl", "text": "Russian athletes have competed under several different guises throughout the 128-year history of the Olympics, and they will be known by another new name at Paris 2024. Following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine \u2013 supported by Belarus \u2013 in February 2022, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) recommended that Russian and Belarusian athletes should be prohibited from competing in international sporting events. In January 2023, the IOC announced its intention to allow these athletes to compete as neutrals, in a similar way to how Russian and Belarusian tennis players are presented at ATP, WTA and Grand Slam events without any reference to their nationality. The Russian Olympic Committee was then suspended entirely by the IOC in October 2023 when it absorbed Ukrainian regional sports organizations in Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia. There has been much debate around whether Russian and Belarusian athletes should be permitted to take part in the Olympics, with Ukrainian athletes in particular voicing their concerns. However, the IOC Executive Board ruled that it would be unfair to punish athletes based on their passports alone, thereby allowing some to compete in Paris, albeit under very strict conditions. Here\u2019s everything you need to know about the participation of Russian and Belarusian athletes at the 2024 Olympics. \u2018No flag, anthem, colors\u2019 An Individual Neutral Athlete is the name used to refer to athletes with either a Russian or Belarusian passport who will be competing at this year\u2019s Games in July and August. These athletes are referred to by the abbreviation AIN, which comes from the French translation Athl\u00e8tes Individuels Neutres. These athletes will be permitted to compete if they meet eligibility requirements. No reference to either country will be made at the Games through the athletes\u2019 participation. \u201cThe sanctions against those responsible for the war, the Russian and Belarusian states and governments, remain in place for the Olympic Games Paris 2024,\u201d the IOC said in a statement. \u201cNo flag, anthem, colors or any other identifications whatsoever of Russia or Belarus will be displayed at the Olympic Games Paris 2024 in any official venue or any official function,\u201d the statement continues. Competition gear for the AINs has not yet been revealed, so it is unclear whether it will bear the turquoise colors of the brand-new flag of the AINs, or that they will don basic sportswear. An anthem \u2013 without lyrics \u2013 has also been commissioned for use in medal ceremonies. Though AINs are eligible to compete and win Olympic medals, they will not be displayed in the medal table of nations. AINs will also be excluded from the parade of delegations at the Opening Ceremony on the basis that they are individual athletes rather than a team, though the IOC has said \u201can opportunity will be provided for them to experience the event.\u201d Individual Neutral Athlete Eligibility Review Panel In December 2023, the Executive Board of the IOC decided that Russian and Belarusian athletes who qualified through the existing qualification systems of international federations would have to meet strict requirements if they are to be selected as an AIN. There will be no Russian or Belarusian representation in team events, with participation limited to individual competition. Per the IOC, athletes who actively support the war or who are contracted to the Russian or Belarusian military or national security agencies will not be eligible to be entered or to compete. The same stipulation applies to support personnel. Like all other athletes, AINs will need to meet anti-doping requirements to be considered for selection. The eligibility of these athletes will be determined by the newly established Individual Neutral Athlete Eligibility Review Panel. Two-time NBA champion and six-time All-Star Pau Gasol is part of the panel, representing the IOC Ethics Commission. The Spaniard will sit alongside IOC Vice-President and former artistic swimmer Nicole Hoevertsz, and former Olympic table tennis gold medalist Ryu Seung-min, who will be representing the Athletes\u2019 Commission. International sporting federations will need to submit their lists of qualified athletes to panel for review. At the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo (postponed to 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic) and the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, Russian athletes competed under the name of the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) \u00a0as a result of the country\u2019s state-sponsored doping program. Athletes could compete under the ROC banner if they could prove that they were not connected to the scandal. However, with the ROC bearing both the name and colors of Russia \u2013 as well as the subsequent suspension of the ROC in October \u2013 it was no longer a viable option for Russian athletes to compete under this name in Paris. It is also important to note that the ROC was not a neutral body, rather a delegation of Russian athletes which technically didn\u2019t compete on the behalf of Russia, but retained a right to represent the country in all but an official capacity. Numbers of AINs at the Paris Olympics The IOC stated that, as of March 28, 12 AINs with a Russian passport and seven AINs with a Belarusian passport have qualified for Paris 2024 but said that the final number of athletes who will actually compete at the Games would not be communicated until the selection process has been finalized. \u201cThe maximum number, which is unlikely to be reached, would be 55 and 28 respectively,\u201d the IOC told CNN. In comparison, Russia sent 330 athletes to Tokyo in 2021 while Belarus sent 104. There is also the matter of whether Moscow will actually accept the conditions laid out by the IOC. Russia is planning to host its own \u201cFriendship Games\u201d later in the year, an event which has been condemned by the IOC. The identity of the athletes is also yet to be revealed, but it is possible that Russian former world No. 1 tennis player Daniil Medvedev will be part of the field. The former US Open champion said that he would be happy to participate as a neutral. \u201cI decided for myself that whenever I can play the Olympics, I want to be there I want to represent what I can represent,\u201d he told reporters last month. \u201cIf it\u2019s not under the flag, I know who I am, I know why I play tennis and I played like this all my life. Russia has competed under a neutral banner on two previous occasions. The ROC was suspended in 2017 as a result of the doping scandal ahead of the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea the following year, but selected Russian athletes who met pre-competition conditions were still given the opportunity to compete as \u201cOlympic Athletes from Russia\u201d and were represented by the Olympic flag. Russia and Belarus were also part of the \u201cUnified Team\u201d at the 1992 Summer Games in Barcelona after the dissolution of the Soviet Union the previous year. The delegation was made up of former Soviet republics \u2013 aside from the Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia \u2013 which had elected to compete as one unit. The Unified Team also bore the Olympic flag but winners were honored under the flags of their own nations.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/sport/individual-neutral-athlete-olympics-explainer-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_21_middleeast_iran-president-helicopter-crash-sanctions-intl", "text": "Even before Iran\u2019s army chief Mohammad Bagheri ordered an investigation into the helicopter crash that cost the Islamic Republic the lives of two of its top politicians, blame was being laid at America\u2019s door. The body of President Ebrahim Raisi was being carefully carried from the crash site as former Foreign Minister Javad Zarif acidly told Iran\u2019s state TV that, \u201cOne of the causes of this heart-breaking incident is the United States, which by sanctioning the sale of the aviation industry to Iran caused the martyrdom of the president and his companions. The US\u2019s crime will be recorded in the minds of the Iranian people and history.\u201d US officials quickly dismissed the allegations as \u201cbaseless.\u201d There are many reasons the aging American-made, Vietnam war-era Bell 212 helicopter may have crashed. Poor maintenance or human error in the dense fog are among them. Turkish Transport Minister Abdulkadir Uraloglu has said it is too soon to comment on the cause of the crash, but initial indications suggested it was an accident due to foggy weather. But why did Iran risk both president and foreign minister on the same helicopter, when there were three used that day to carry the delegation to the dam opening on the border with Azerbaijan? When Raisi \u2013 accompanied by his Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, the provincial governor Malek Rahmati, and the influential Imam of Friday prayers in Tabriz, Mohammed Ali Alehashem \u2013 got out of the helicopter at the Qiz Ghal\u2019e dam Sunday morning visibility was good. The sun was shining as Raisi shook hands with his Azeri counterpart Ilham Aliyav at their border on the bridge over the calm waters of the Aras river in the middle of the dam. The day had got off to an apparently good start. Previously frosty relations between the two nations appeared to be warming. On the route picked by the flight crew for their journey to the regional center of Tabriz, where the president\u2019s plane was waiting, the weather was worsening. Although seasonal rains had been diminishing another weather front was moving in. Cold and wet. Fog was thickening around the rugged, remote and unforgiving 1,800 meter (5,900 feet) peaks on the direct flight path. So question one, why fly through the mountains when a detour around the range or to another destination might have been safer? The next question might be, knowing the weather was bad and having three helicopters on the journey, why put both president and foreign minister in the same aircraft? The crash, also revealed Iran\u2019s lack of readiness to deal with a calamity of this nature. There seemed to be no shortage of manpower, but they were hamstrung, lacking adequate technology. In the middle of the night while hundreds, if not thousands, of medics, mountaineers, soldiers, police and even the elite Revolutionary Guard Corps, scoured the steep mountain peaks and deep ravines it was Turkish drone AKINCI, flying loops above the clouds, that first located traces of the helicopter. For a nation that makes, uses, and exports long-range killer drones to countries like Russia for its war in Ukraine, and non-state actors like Iraqi militia and Yemen\u2019s Houthis \u2013 who are currently holding global maritime trade to ransom targeting ships in the Red Sea \u2013 they didn\u2019t appear to have a simple surveillance drone capable of the job. Shortly before AKINCI began etching its systematic surveillance pattern in the night sky Iran had also asked Turkey and Russia for night vision capable helicopters. By implication, if they had them, they couldn\u2019t get them there fast enough. This night, of apparently vital importance to Iran and its Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran\u2019s military prowess \u2013 projected through its axis of proxies in the Middle East and its ally Russia \u2013 seemed hollow. Former Foreign Minister Zarif would want the world to believe Iran\u2019s technological core has been hollowed out by US sanctions, but that allegation too is tainted by hubris. If, as he claims, the president\u2019s helicopter were victim to a paucity of quality spare parts due to US sanctions, why risk the life of the president and the foreign minister in an aircraft considered potentially unreliable. What other air transport possibilities were there, and if there were none that begs the same question, doubly so. Iran\u2019s presidents are not idle, they need to go places. Planning for better options could have been made a bigger priority. Did hubris among the president\u2019s staff or in the upper echelons of the military chose to trust to chance. According to Zarif, maintenance of the Bell 212 was a predictable problem. It wouldn\u2019t be the first time hubris hollowed out logic, but it is certainly the most tragic for those involved. The implicit irony is that Raisi himself was an architect of Iran\u2019s aura of power, only to find it was vacuous when he needed it most.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/middleeast/iran-president-helicopter-crash-sanctions-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_asia_north-korea-propaganda-song-ban-intl-hnk", "text": "A North Korean propaganda song extolling Kim Jong Un as \u201ca great leader and a friendly parent\u201d has gone viral on TikTok, with mashups and dances racking up millions of views, leading to South Korea banning the tune due to \u201cpsychological warfare.\u201d Seoul\u2019s media regulator on Monday announced it was blocking access to versions of \u201cFriendly Father,\u201d the\u00a0cheery propaganda hit that became\u00a0an unlikely social media sensation. The song\u00a0was\u00a0unveiled in April during a nighttime concert to mark the completion of a housing project in the capital Pyongyang, according to North Korean\u00a0state-run Korean Central News Agency. Its lyrics praise\u00a0Kim \u2013 the third-generation leader of one of the world\u2019s most autocratic nations \u2013 as \u201ca great leader and a friendly parent,\u201d and the music video depicts North Koreans enthusiastically belting out the orchestral song proclaiming that Kim \u201ctakes care of us with affection.\u201d While North Korean propaganda is nothing new, the difference this time is that \u201cFriendly Father\u201d was posted on TikTok \u2013 whose owner is Chinese internet giant ByteDance. The song went viral after content creators around the world used it to make their own edits of the music video adding dances and\u00a0unserious captions to their own short one-minute clips on the platform, garnering over 2 million views. But it wasn\u2019t necessarily a propaganda coup for Pyongyang. \u201cThis isn\u2019t Gen Z suddenly declaring allegiance for the regime,\u201d said Alexandra Leonzini, a Cambridge University scholar conducting research on North Korean music. \u201cThey\u2019re laughing at the regime not with the regime.\u201d Nonetheless, South Korean security officials came down on the parodies. The Korea Communications Standards Commission decided to block 29 videos of the song, following a request from Seoul\u2019s National Intelligence Service. But some versions of the song on YouTube were still accessible to users in South Korea as of Wednesday. \u201cThe video is typical content linked to psychological warfare against South Korea, as it was posted on a channel operated to connect with the outside world and mainly focused on unilaterally idolizing and glorifying Kim,\u201d the regulator said in a statement. The ban was not a surprise, as the country\u2019s National Security Act blocks access to North Korean government websites and media, restricting exposure to Kim\u2019s autocratic regime and penalizing behaviors promoting its authoritarian and nuclear-armed neighbor. More than 90% of the reclusive state\u2019s propaganda songs are about idolizing its leader and \u201cFriendly Father\u201d is no different, said Ha Seung-hee, visiting professor of North Korea studies at Dongguk University. But it does show an improvement in production values, and could signal a new propaganda strategy for the country. \u201cNorth Korea\u2019s music videos used to show nature and scenery, like something you\u2019d see at a karaoke with subtitles\u2026 but now, it\u2019s changed,\u201d Ha said, adding that \u201cFriendly Father\u201d appears to have used better choreography and video editing. \u201cNorth Korea didn\u2019t intend it, but whether it was the algorithm or something else, the video got attention and once Pyongyang learns that it is effective, it can make new content in this method,\u201d Ha said. North and South Korea have been cut off from each other since the Korean War in 1953 ended with an armistice. The two sides are still technically at war, but both governments have long sought the goal of one day reunifying, and still view each other as hostile. Millions of North Koreans live in impoverished conditions under totalitarian dictatorship, which has continued for over seven decades spanning three generations of the Kim dynasty. The regime controls everything from food rations, access to education and assignment of jobs, and people are often put into grueling work camps.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/asia/north-korea-propaganda-song-ban-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2013_05_31_weather_hurricane-statistics-fast-facts", "text": "Here\u2019s a look at hurricane statistics. Notable Hurricanes in Recent US History September 23-30, 2022 - Hurricane Ian Category 4 storm. Made first landfall in Cuba as a Category 3. Hit the southwestern coast of Florida as a Category 4 and made a second US landfall in South Carolina as a Category 1.  The storm directly caused at least 66 deaths in Florida. August 26-September 1, 2021 - Hurricane Ida Category 4 storm. Made first landfall in Cuba as a Category 1 hurricane and hit the Louisiana coast near Port Fourchon as a Category 4 hurricane. The storm directly caused at least 55 deaths in Louisiana, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Connecticut. October 7-11, 2018 - Hurricane Michael Category 5 storm. Made landfall in Florida near Mexico Beach and the Tyndall Air Force Base.  The hurricane was designated as a Category 4 storm when it made landfall in Florida but a post storm analysis revealed that winds reached 160 mph, prompting the upgrade by the National Hurricane Center. It is rare for category 5 storms to directly hit the mainland United States.  The storm\u2019s atmospheric pressure was 919 millibars at landfall, the third lowest pressure on record for a hurricane hitting the United States in modern times.   The town of Mexico Beach was devastated by the storm. Out of 1,692 buildings in town, 1,584 buildings were reported damaged, with 809 of those reported destroyed. At the Tyndall Air Force Base, all buildings in the complex were reported damaged.  The storm directly caused at least 16 deaths in Florida, Virginia, North Carolina and Georgia. September 16-30, 2017 - Hurricane Maria Category 5 storm. Made landfall on the island of Dominica as a Category 5 hurricane and hit Puerto Rico as a Category 4 hurricane. The official death toll after the storm was 64 in Puerto Rico but investigations by CNN and other news organizations indicated there may have been more than 1,000 storm-related fatalities on the island.  The Puerto Rican government raised Maria\u2019s death toll from 64 to 2,975 after a report on storm fatalities was published in August 2018 by researchers at George Washington University.   Earlier, an academic report published in the New England Journal of Medicine estimated 4,645 people died during the storm and its aftermath. The article\u2019s authors called Puerto Rico\u2019s official death toll of 64 a \u201csubstantial underestimate.\u201d However, the death toll cited in the article was a midpoint estimate based on a limited survey of 3,299 households. The survey indicated that the number of people who died in the storm\u2019s wake could range from 793 to 8,498.    Additionally, 31 people were killed in Dominica as a direct result of the storm. Deaths were also reported in St. Thomas, the Dominican Republic and Haiti. Three people drowned due to rip currents off the coast of New Jersey and a fourth drowning death was reported in Florida.   Massive damage to the aging electrical grid led to widespread outages that stretched on for months.  August 30-September 12, 2017 - Hurricane Irma Category 5 storm. Made seven landfalls, including four as a Category 5 hurricane across islands in the northern Caribbean. Hit the Florida Keys as a Category 4 storm and made landfall in southwestern Florida as a Category 3 storm.  More than six million Florida residents were ordered to evacuate ahead of the storm.  Irma directly caused at least 47 deaths in the Caribbean Islands and the southeastern United States. August 17-September 1, 2017 - Hurricane Harvey Category 4 storm. Made first landfall near Rockport, Texas as a Category 4 hurricane and churned along the Texas coast for four days, causing devastating flooding. Its remnants later made another landfall in southwestern Louisiana.   It set a record for the most rainfall from a tropical cyclone in the continental United States, with 51 inches of rain recorded in areas of Texas. An estimated 27 trillion gallons of water fell over Texas and Louisiana during a six-day period.   At least 68 direct storm-related fatalities were reported in Texas, the highest hurricane death toll in the state since 1919.  October 22-29, 2012 - Hurricane Sandy Category 3 storm. Made landfall in Cuba as a Category 2. Hit New Jersey as a post-tropical cyclone. Path included Haiti, Jamaica, Cuba and the coastlines of New Jersey and New York. An extraordinarily large storm, with tropical storm-force winds extending 870 nautical miles in diameter. At least 147 direct deaths, including 72 in the United States, 54 in Haiti, 11 in Cuba, three in the Dominican Republic, two in the Bahamas, one in Canada, one in Jamaica, one in Puerto Rico and two maritime deaths. August 21-September 1, 2012 - Hurricane Isaac Category 1 storm Path included Haiti, Cuba, southern Mississippi and southeastern Louisiana.   The direct death toll from Isaac was estimated to be 34 fatalities in the United States, Haiti and the Dominican Republic. August 20-29, 2011 - Hurricane Irene Category 3 storm. Made landfall in eastern North Carolina as a Category 1. Death toll directly attributed to Irene was 48, with five in the Dominican Republic, three in Haiti and 40 in the United States. October 29-November 7, 2010 - Hurricane Tomas Category 2 storm. Hit St. Lucia as a Category 1. Affected areas included St. Lucia, Barbados, St. Vincent, the Grenadines, Curacao, and Haiti. Death toll of 44 in the Lesser and Greater Antilles. September 1-14, 2008 - Hurricane Ike Category 4 storm. Made landfall over the Turks and Caicos Islands as a Category 4. Hit Galveston Island, Texas as a Category 2. Path included Turks and Caicos Islands, Cuba, Texas, Louisiana and Arkansas. Direct death toll was 103 across Hispaniola, Cuba and the Gulf Coast of the United States. October 15-25, 2005 - Hurricane Wilma Category 5 storm. Made landfall over Cozumel, Mexico as a Category 4. Later, made landfall near Cape Romano, Florida as a Category 3. Death toll directly attributed to Wilma was 23, with five in the United States, 12 in Haiti, four in Mexico, one in Jamaica and one in the Bahamas September 20-24, 2005 - Hurricane Rita Category 5 storm. Made landfall near the border of Louisiana and Texas as a Category 3. Death toll directly attributed to Rita was seven.  August 25-29, 2005 - Hurricane Katrina Category 5 storm. Hit Florida as a Category 1. Hit Buras, Louisiana as a Category 3. Path included Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana. Direct and indirect death toll in the United States was 1,833. September 2-24, 2004 - Hurricane Ivan Category 5 storm. Hit Grenada as a Category 3. Affected areas included the Gulf Coast of the United States, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Venezuela and Caribbean islands. Death toll directly attributed to Ivan was 92, with 25 in the United States, 39 in Grenada, 17 in Jamaica, four in the Dominican Republic, three in Venezuela, two in the Cayman Islands, one in Tobago and one in Barbados August 25-September 8, 2004 - Hurricane Frances Category 3 storm.

{"id": "2024_05_23_travel_star-wars-hotel-disney-jenny-nicholson-cec", "text": "In 2023, Disney closed a highly-publicized luxury hotel on the Walt Disney World property called \u201cStar Wars: Galactic Starcruiser.\u201d For Disney superfans, it was a time of high drama and schadenfreude as promises about the hotel\u2019s immersive world ran aground on the rocky reality of some guests\u2019 experiences. Now, a year later, a four-hour-long YouTube deep-dive has resurfaced details about the concept and spread the niche piece of Disney lore to millions of viewers. The creator of the video, YouTuber Jenny Nicholson, is known for her commentary on various corners of fan culture. Some of her most popular videos cover shows and movies like \u201cThe Vampire Diaries,\u201d \u201cPirates of the Caribbean\u201d and installments in the \u201cStar Wars\u201d franchise. None of them are nearly as long as her most recent video, \u201cThe Spectacular Failure of the Star Wars Hotel.\u201d Over the course of 20 video chapters, Nicholson details her 2022 stay at the \u201cStar Wars: Galactic Starcruiser\u201d hotel in Orlando, Florida. The tale is likely familiar to Disney and Star Wars fans, many of whom heard about the high-dollar, high-concept hotel and its closure in 2023. Nicholson says she paid more than $6,000 for a two-night stay in the hotel, which was supposed to resemble a Star Wars-style spaceship called the Halcyon. The big draw of the hotel lay in what Disney marketing called an \u201cimmersive, customizable Star Wars experience\u201d that Nicholson equated to LARPing, or live-action roleplaying. Guests were encouraged to dress up, and through a combination of live experiences with cast members and choices made in a special app, were guided through a three-day-long Star Wars storyline complete with full itinerary and, if played to its full extent, very little downtime. With Disney-esque details like working lightsabers and colorful themed food, the experience was supposed to feel like a \u201clandlocked cruise,\u201d with all of the entertainment happening onboard the ship \u2014 in reality, a large ultra-secure windowless building near Walt Disney World\u2019s Epcot resort area. Nicholson\u2019s experience squared with some more critical reviews of the hotel: Cramped rooms, inconsistent experiences with technology and a general sense of confusion as to the purpose or audience of the venture. (She also mentioned, at length, some of the things she enjoyed, like cast member performances and details in the ship-hotel\u2019s interior.) Little of this is new information. Disney announced the closing of the Galactic Starcruiser in May 2023, and the hotel served its last guests last September. In a press release provided to CNN from that time, Disney said the project \u201cgave us the opportunity to try new things.\u201d \u201cStar Wars: Galactic Starcruiser is one of our most creative projects ever and has been praised by our guests and recognized for setting a new bar for innovation and immersive entertainment,\u201d the statement read. \u201c\u2026 we will take what we\u2019ve learned to create future experiences that can reach more of our guests and fans.\u201d Still, Nicholson\u2019s video netted more than 2 million views in two days, and has already wormed its way into the social media pipeline of memes and references. Some X users marveled at the fact that they willingly watched a double feature-length video about, as one user said, something they \u201cpreviously never gave a s*** about in my life.\u201d Why yesterday\u2019s drama draws today\u2019s audience Longform videos are an increasingly popular form of YouTube entertainment, and it isn\u2019t unusual to see older topics being reexamined in multi-hour \u201cdeep dives.\u201d Nicholson\u2019s video also combines several winning formulas into one: Disney, Star Wars, insider information (Nicholson includes pictures and videos from her time in the hotel) and, of course, failures. \u201cI couldn\u2019t care less about some dumb Star Wars hotel, but give me those 4 hours,\u201d one X user said. Consumer research from Google claims that longform videos are gaining traction among younger viewers and, interestingly, are even more successful when they cover \u201cfan culture\u201d content. \u201cThere is a healthy appetite for more in-depth exploration of topics such as film, TV, and sports,\u201d a 2022 Google consumer insights report reads. \u201cThese allow for fan-centric creators to share thoughts and ideas at length with an increasingly captive audience: 61% of Gen Z would describe themselves as a \u201creally big\u201d or \u201csuper fan\u201d of someone or something.\u201d Both Star Wars and Disney enjoy particularly loyal fandoms with elephant memories and no qualms about engaging the same topics over and over again. Even the tiniest details in a Star Wars movie or a Disney theme park have cult followings, backstories, fan lore and, of course, their own video deep dives. A spotlight on Disney\u2019s future Nicholson\u2019s video, while not exactly breaking news, drops as Disney prepares a new slate of innovations. Earlier this year, Disney announced a massive 10-year, $60 billion expansion program for its parks, cruises and experiences worldwide. That includes a planned 14-acre expansion at the Magic Kingdom in Orlando\u2019s Walt Disney World and an expansion of the original Disneyland in Anaheim. The company recently got final approval from Anaheim\u2019s city council to move forward with DisneylandForward, a nearly $2 billion investment in the Disneyland resort and surrounding areas. \u201cWe\u2019re ready to build on decades of innovation, creativity, and storytelling to bring new, exciting experiences for our guests,\u201d Disneyland Resort President Ken Potrock wrote in a blog post announcing the approval of the project. In April, Disney CEO Bob Iger said expansion plans for Walt Disney World are on track after the settlement of a long legal battle between Disney and the state of Florida. Iger said the decision \u201cwill actually enable us to pursue the kind of significant investment in our Florida parks.\u201d Disney enthusiasts are expecting a trove of new information this August, when the company hosts its annual D23 Expo that focuses on upcoming projects and attractions. While the Galactic Starcruiser hotel has now earned a place in the annals of Disney lore, renewed interest in its failure provides a new lens through which to see Disney Parks\u2019 ambitions and expansions. Will they live up to everyone\u2019s wildest dreams, or be the subject of the next four-hour YouTube deep dive?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/travel/star-wars-hotel-disney-jenny-nicholson-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_18_europe_ukraine-kuleba-aid-battlefield-setbacks-intl", "text": "Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Saturday he blames \u201ceveryone who is not doing enough\u201d for Ukraine\u2019s recent setbacks on the battlefield as he admitted the current situation on the frontline was \u201ctough.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m grateful to everyone, but I blame everyone who is not doing enough,\u201d Kuleba said speaking via videoconference at the Lennart Meri Conference in Tallinn, Estonia. He was responding to a question from CNN\u2019s Jim Sciutto about whether he holds the US responsible for the delay in aid which Russian forces have been able to take advantage of and advance further into Ukraine. Kuleba\u2019s comments come after Moscow has ramped up its offensive in northern Ukraine. Last week it\u00a0launched its most surprising operation\u00a0in two years of war, crossing the northern border in renewed attempts to take Kharkiv, the country\u2019s second most populous city. Vovchansk, in the northern Kharkiv region, has faced an onslaught, with Russian forces claiming to control surrounding villages, forcing civilians to flee. Analysts say Russia was prepared for the hiatus in Western military aid to Ukraine and has exploited it for its own gain. \u201cUkraine may need to make difficult decisions due to slowness of US action and the dilemma that is now causing,\u201d George Barros at the Institute for the Study of War in Washington previously told CNN. It comes as Kyiv\u2019s forces are thinly stretched, with much less artillery than the Russians, inadequate air defenses and a lack of soldiers. Kuleba described Ukraine\u2019s current position on the frontline as \u201ctough.\u201d \u201cRussia is strong, we are suffering from\u2026 insufficient supplies of military assistance which we are forced to compensate with heroism and sacrifice of our soldiers,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the main message remains the same: send us everything. Because we have proven over these two years that when our soldiers have everything they need, we succeed, and when we don\u2019t have everything that we need, we don\u2019t,\u201d he added. The foreign minister went on to say the situation on the battlefield would be different if countries did more to assist Ukraine, claiming that if every country were to follow Estonia\u2019s footsteps in allocating 1% of GDP to military aid for Ukraine they would be able to perform better on the battlefield. \u201cEstonia is a country that proves to the whole world that a small country with a big heart can make a big difference and it\u2019s a paradigm for everyone to follow,\u201d he said. Kuleba said Ukraine will \u201cwork hard on plan A which is the continuation of support and ramping up support to make Ukraine win.\u201d CNN\u2019s Tim Lister contributed to this report.

{"id": "2024_05_23_weather_hurricane-season-forecast-gulf-coast-climate", "text": "The official start of what is likely to be an active Atlantic hurricane season is almost here. While that introduces the threat of tropical trouble across the eastern US, the Gulf Coast states are at even higher risk to a hurricane\u2019s deadliest threat: water. Federal forecasters joined the\u00a0chorus of expert voices\u00a0calling for a hyperactive Atlantic hurricane season when NOAA\u2019s National Hurricane Center released its official preseason forecast Thursday. An above average season is expected with between 17 and 25 named storms. Of these storms, 8 to 13 could become hurricanes, 4 to 7 of which could strengthen into Category 3 or stronger. This is the most aggressive preseason forecast issued for NOAA\u2019s hurricane season outlook. \u201cThis season is looking to be an extraordinary one in a number of ways,\u201d NOAA Administrator Rick Spinrad said at the news conference. The ominous forecast comes as a vast area of the South has been deluged by drenching, flooding storms in recent weeks and dozens of cities from Texas to the Florida Panhandle are having one of their wettest years to date. The soil is saturated, and the more saturated it is, the less time it will take for heavy rain to trigger flooding, Barry Keim, a climatologist with Louisiana State University, explained. Soils in the South typically would be able to absorb a few inches of rain before becoming overwhelmed, but that\u2019s not the case currently, Keim told CNN. After weeks of rain, the ground is already overwhelmed. Now the region is headed into its wettest season: summer. Tropical activity plays a vital role in making it so. As much as 25% of annual rainfall for the Gulf Coast states comes from tropical systems, according to a 2021 study published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters. New Orleans, for example, typically receives between 15% and 20% of its 63 inches of annual rainfall from tropical systems. But individual storms often unload much more than a few inches of rain \u2013 some of the most prolific have dumped feet of it, something becoming increasingly common as climate change supercharges rainfall in hurricanes. And that\u2019s a big deal with a potentially more active hurricane season and its increased chances for torrential, tropical rainfall on the horizon. Inland flooding surpassed storm surge as the deadliest threat from tropical systems, according to 2023 research from the National Hurricane Center. Driven by a budding La Ni\u00f1a and extremely warm ocean waters, the National Hurricane Center and many other forecasters are calling for a hyperactive season starting June 1 that could place the US coastline at risk of more tropical strikes. Drenching tropical systems could also arrive when they would do the most harm: early in the season. The region is often more vulnerable to flooding in the early part of hurricane season and that\u2019s particularly the case this year, Keim explained. A named tropical storm or hurricane has formed in either May or early June in every hurricane season since 2015. Not every storm threatened land, but some like 2022\u2019s Tropical Storm Alex did. This year\u2019s exceptionally wet head start will likely extend the flood threat longer into hurricane season, unless summer heat ramps up quickly and bakes the moisture out of the ground. Last year, a dearth of tropical systems and surplus of heat domes suppressed rain and plunged parts of the South into the worst drought on record. Latest hurricane outlook There\u2019s an 85% chance of an above average season and only a 5% chance the season will be below average, according to NOAA. A waning El Ni\u00f1o and the anticipation of a building La Ni\u00f1a this summer is one of the biggest indicators that the upcoming season will be very active. El Ni\u00f1o tends to create more hostile upper level winds that rip storms apart while La Ni\u00f1a does the opposite. Unlike last year, El Ni\u00f1o will not be around to curve many tropical cyclones away from the US, potentially leaving the coasts vulnerable this season. Extreme, record-breaking ocean heat is another major factor an average season could be out of reach. Warm water acts like food for storms, helping them to form, strengthen and survive. Off-the-charts ocean heat last year not only created more storms in the Atlantic by neutralizing the storm-dampening effects of El Ni\u00f1o, but also fueled explosive strengthening \u2013 called rapid intensification \u2013 of the storms that formed across the globe. Rapid intensification is becoming more likely as the atmosphere and oceans warm in a changing climate. And the Atlantic Ocean is still record warm, both at and below the surface.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/weather/hurricane-season-forecast-gulf-coast-climate/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_africa_south-africa-elections-explained-intl", "text": "South Africans go to the polls on May 29 for what will likely be the most pivotal general election since the end of apartheid. Polls show the ruling African National Congress (ANC) party could lose its majority for the first time since Nelson Mandela led the party to power in 1994. While polling can be challenging in South Africa, most analysts believe that the ANC faces its stiffest challenge yet with a population deeply frustrated by the country\u2019s direction. This is the seventh general election South Africa has held since the end of white minority rule 30 years ago. A record 27.79 million people are registered to vote \u2013 the highest number to date, according to the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC.) The slide in popularity mirrors the challenges of liberation movements that have transitioned into governing parties across the continent. What could happen? If support for the ANC drops below 50% for the first time, the party will be forced to enter into a coalition government. A loss of a simple majority would put significant pressure on President Cyril Ramaphosa within his party, as he promised a \u201cnew dawn\u201d when he took over leadership in 2018 from disgraced former president Jacob Zuma. Support for the ANC has been on a slow downward trend over the decades but at the last election in 2019 it dropped below 60% for the first time, with the party earning 57.50% of the vote. What\u2019s gone wrong for the ANC? South Africans have a lot to grumble about. Violent crime is on the rise. Murder is at a 20-year high; with someone killed in the country roughly every 20 minutes, according to the most recent quarterly police crime statistics. Many have lost faith in the police as part of a larger breakdown in trust in government. The Rainbow Nation has the highest sustained rate of unemployment in the world \u2013 and it\u2019s growing.Meanwhile, rolling electricity blackouts, water outages, a crisis in education, and a lack of service delivery all weigh on the population. But high on the list of issues are the allegations of corruption and mismanagement that continue to damage the ANC. When Ramaphosa \u2013 Mandela\u2019s favorite to succeed him as leader \u2013 replaced scandal-plagued Jacob Zuma as president, he pledged \u201cto work very hard not to disappoint the people of South Africa.\u201d But in 2022, Ramaphosa was himself forced to deny stealing money. \u201cCorruption has wounded our democracy and shaken people\u2019s faith in our institutions,\u201d he admitted in a November speech. \u201cIf corruption is not arrested, the greatest damage will not be in the funds stolen, the jobs lost, or the services not delivered. The greatest damage will be to the belief in democracy itself,\u201d he added. This year South Africa received its lowest score on Transparency International\u2019s Corruption Perception Index. The index scores countries from 0 (highly corrupt) to 100 (very clean). South Africa received 41 \u2013 worse than China and Cuba at 42. What are the other key parties? The country\u2019s main opposition party, the centrist Democratic Alliance (DA), is led by John Steenhuisen and is seen by many as a party for White South Africans. For this election, the DA has formed a coalition bloc with smaller opposition parties called the Multi-Party Charter. If the polls are to be believed, the ANC may have to make the choice between forming a coalition with the Zuma-backed party \u2013 uMkhonto weSizwe Party (MK) \u2013 and the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) or the DA. Steenhuisen, for his part, has not ruled out going into coalition with the ANC if it were to keep the EFF and MK out of government. The EFF is a populist far-left party led by former ANC youth leader Julius Malema. It began as a splinter party of the ANC and espouses expropriation of land without compensation and sweeping state nationalism. The EFF has shown support for the MK party and Malema recently said that he intends to \u201cgive the EFF vote to the ANC\u201d if it doesn\u2019t get 50% \u2013 on the condition that his deputy, Floyd Shivambu, becomes Minister of Finance. Steenhuisen has described an ANC-EFF-MK pact as a \u201cdoomsday coalition.\u201d Talking of Zuma\u2026 The former president continues to be a thorn in Ramaphosa\u2019s side. After a brief stint in jail in 2021 for contempt of court after failing to appear before a corruption inquiry, the 82-year-old is now the leader of the MK party \u2013 and was up until this week top of their parliamentary list. The country\u2019s Constitutional Court ruled Monday he is not eligible to run for parliament\u00a0until five years have elapsed since the completion of his sentence. The unanimous ruling capped months-long speculation and legal wrangling on whether he could stand for the country\u2019s top legislative body. His party will still contest the election and his face will remain on the ballot. Zuma had been campaigning against what he perceives as Ramaphosa\u2019s failures and disillusioned ANC voters were lapping it up, according to polls. An April poll by the Johannesburg-based Social Research Foundation poll found the ANC may get 37% of the vote, while MK may garner 13%. However, the most recent polling from the same foundation puts support for the MK party at 10.5% and\u00a0the ANC at 44.8% on Monday.\u00a0This suggests the ANC may be winning back support and may only need a small coalition partner.  When will we know the final result? The final election results will be announced on Sunday 2 June, the IEC said. However, projections should give a sense of the result a day or two after polls close and the final result could be announced sooner if vote counting is completed earlier.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/africa/south-africa-elections-explained-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "world"}}

Adinun Kittiratanapaibool, director of the Samitivej Srinakarin Hospital in the Thai capital, told reporters on Thursday that it is treating 22 patients with spine and spinal cord issues, six with skull and brain injuries, and another 13 for bone, muscle or soft tissue complaints. The doctor added that 17 patients had undergone surgery, including procedures like  suturing to spinal operations. Flight SQ321 from London to Singapore was cruising at 37,000 feet on Tuesday when the plane\u00a0dropped sharply before climbing\u00a0several hundred feet, according to flight tracking data. It then repeated to dip and ascend for about a minute. Many passengers were having breakfast at the time of the incident. Video and images from inside the aircraft after its emergency landing in Bangkok showed the extent of the damage, with overhead compartments smashed open and emergency oxygen air masks dangling above the seats. A photo of one galley showed a section of the ceiling open with parts of the plane\u2019s interior hanging down.

As part of the drills, dozens of Chinese fighter jets carrying live ammunition conducted mock strikes against \u201chigh-value military targets\u201d of the \u201cenemy\u201d alongside destroyers, frigates and missile speedboats, according to China\u2019s state broadcaster CCTV. The exercises, which started early on Thursday and will encircle Taiwan, pose the first real test for newly elected Lai Ching-te as he attempts to manage relations with the island\u2019s powerful authoritarian\u00a0neighbor. China\u2019s ruling Communist Party says Taiwan is part of its territory, despite never having controlled it, and has vowed to take the island, by force if necessary. China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) said it launched joint military drills involving the army, navy, air force and rocket force in areas around Taiwan at 7.45 a.m. on Thursday. The drills are being conducted in the Taiwan Strait \u2013 a narrow body of water separating the island from mainland China \u2013 as well as north, south and east of Taiwan. They are also taking place in areas around Taiwan\u2019s outlying islands of Kinmen, Matsu, Wuqiu and Dongyin, located just off China\u2019s southeastern coast, the PLA\u2019s Eastern Theater Command said in a statement. PLA Naval Colonel Li Xi, spokesperson for the command, called the exercises \u201ca strong punishment for the separatist acts of Taiwan independence forces and a serious warning against interference and provocation by external forces.\u201d A senior official responsible for Taiwan\u2019s security affairs told CNN that as of noon Thursday, the island detected about 30 Chinese aircraft, most of which crossed the Median Line into Taiwan\u2019s air defense identification zone (ADIZ).\u00a0The Median Line is an informal demarcation point in the Taiwan Strait that Beijing does not recognize but until recent years had largely respected. The Chinese military also deployed about a dozen Chinese warships around Taiwan, as well as a dozen Coast Guard vessels near Taiwan\u2019s outlying islands,\u00a0according to the official. Taiwan has deployed its own warships to monitor the situation, the official said, adding no Chinese aircraft carrier were involved in the drills so far. \u2018Irrational provocations\u2019 Taiwan\u2019s Lai is detested by Beijing as a \u201cdangerous separatist\u201d for championing the island\u2019s sovereignty and distinct identity. He succeeded two-term president Tsai Ing-wen to start an unprecedented third consecutive term in power for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party. Beijing has denounced Lai\u2019s inauguration speech, during which he called on China to cease its intimidation of Taiwan. Taiwan\u2019s Defense Ministry has condemned China\u2019s drills as \u201cirrational provocations and actions that undermine regional peace and stability.\u201d In a statement Thursday, the ministry said it had dispatched sea, air and ground forces in response to the drills. \u201cWe stand by with firm will and restraint. We seek no conflicts, but we will not shy away from one. We have the confidence to safeguard our national security,\u201d it said. Taiwan\u2019s presidential spokeswoman Karen Kuo said in a statement: \u201cIt is regrettable to see China threatening Taiwan\u2019s democracy and freedom and regional peace and stability with unilateral military provocations.\u201d \u201cIn the face of external challenges and threats, we will continue to defend democracy and have the confidence and ability to protect national security,\u201d Kuo added. In a statement on Thursday, United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres said he was following developments in the Taiwan Strait closely, and urged all parties to \u201crefrain from acts that could escalate tensions in the region.\u201d Taiwan\u2019s 23 million people have long become used to the threat of China\u2019s war drills, and Thursday life continued as normal in the capital Taipei. While Taiwanese news outlets were reporting on the Chinese drills, it was far from the only headline on their agenda, which also included recent political bust ups in the legislature, and even information on filing taxes during the tax season. Taipei\u2019s main stock index, the TAIEX, was 0.26 percent up in mid-afternoon trade. Propaganda push China\u2019s military drills are as often as much about playing to a domestic audience as signaling intentions internationally. China\u2019s military and state media churned out propaganda and highlighted coverage of the drills, which remained a top trending topic Thursday on tightly controlled Chinese social media platforms. Footage of the drills released by the PLA\u2019s Eastern Theater Command showed a guided missile frigate, the Nantong, and a pilot climbing into a fighter jet at a military base. The rhetoric coming from Chinese state media and the PLA portrayed the exercises as a practice run for encircling Taiwan, and even threatening small outlying islands that lie close to China\u2019s mainland. China\u2019s state broadcaster CCTV said multiple destroyer and frigate formations of the Eastern Theater Command Navy \u201cmaneuvered at high speed in multiple directions in the waters surrounding Taiwan, creating an omnidirectional approach in pushing toward the island.\u201d Meanwhile, the command\u2019s air force dispatched dozens of fighter jets to Taiwan\u2019s main island and outlying islands, according to CCTV. \u201cUnder the support and cover of the Army and the Rocket Force, multiple types of aircraft were organized and loaded with live ammunition, flew to the predetermined airspace to establish multiple strike positions, and coordinated with destroyers, frigates, and missile speedboats to simulate attacking the \u2018enemy\u2019s\u2019 high-value military targets and reconnaissance and patrol aircraft,\u201d the report said. In another report, CCTV published a series of posters of what it calls \u201cthe magic weapons killing separatists\u201d promoting Taiwan independence. They include the J-20 and J-16 fighter jets, the Type 052 destroyer and Type 071 amphibious transport dock, and the Dongfeng ballistic missile. Though the report did not specify if they were being used in the ongoing drills. Carl\u00a0Schuster, a former director of operations at the US Pacific Command\u2019s Joint Intelligence Center, said Beijing was trying to stress Taiwan\u2019s older and less numerous hardware. For instance, \u201cTaiwan\u2019s F-16s are over 20 years old and every flight hour tasked to those air frames draws the fuselage and equipment ever closer to refurbishment, which takes them out of service for 1-4 months. It also stresses the force overall, keeping them on edge,\u201d he said. Schuster said in addition to the drills around Taiwan\u2019s main island, the pressing of China\u2019s Coast Guard and other forces into waters close to the outlying islands controlled by Taipei is \u201cprovocative.\u201d \u201cIt puts Taiwan on the spot. If they react militarily or forcefully, they risk triggering a conflict,\u201d he said. Rising tensions Under leader Xi Jinping, China has grown more assertive and ramped up diplomatic, economic and military pressure on Taiwan as the island democracy tightens informal ties with the United States. Officials in Washington have been anticipating for several months the prospect of Chinese\u00a0provocations around the inauguration and had been having contingency conversations as part of their planning, according to officials. Periods of higher tension, like the swearing-in of a new president in Taiwan, are areas where US officials frequently brace for a Chinese show of force, officials say. \u201cThere\u2019s no surprise whenever there\u2019s an action that highlights Taiwan in the international sphere the Chinese feel compelled to make some kind of form of statement,\u201d Marine Corps Lt. Gen. Stephen Sklenka, the deputy commander of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command told the National Press Club of Australia on Thursday. In August 2022, China staged massive war games around Taiwan to show its displeasure with then US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s visit to Taipei. Beijing fired missiles into waters surrounding the island and simulated a blockade with fighter jets and warships, in its largest show of force in years. A similar encirclement exercise was also held in April 2023. Chinese warplanes now regularly fly into Taiwan\u2019s air defense identification zone (ADIZ) and across the Median Line in the Taiwan Strait \u2013 an informal demarcation point that Beijing does not recognize but until recent years had largely respected. Beijing has also exerted pressure on Lai in the lead-up to his inauguration. On May 15, days before Lai took office, Taipei said it detected 45 Chinese military aircraft around Taiwan, the highest single-day number this year. Evan A. Feigenbaum,\u00a0vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, calls China\u2019s latest drills \u201can intimidation tactic, part of a pattern, not a sign of imminent war.\u201d \u201cBeijing has a robust coercion kitbag from which it will mix and match, ratchet up and back and up again to signal its range of options to coerce and inflict pain,\u201d he wrote on social platform X. Some defense experts noted that the name of China\u2019s latest military exercises \u201cJoint Sword-2024A\u201d suggests another round of drills could follow later this year. Drew Thompson, a senior research fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore, noted the drills were part of a pattern. \u201cIt is not a surprise, nor is it a tactical response to President Lai\u2019s speech. These exercises are part of the PLA\u2019s long-term, strategic preparations to fight and win a war over Taiwan,\u201d he told CNN.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/asia/china-military-drills-taiwan-punishment-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_europe_ukraine-russia-lyptsi-kharkiv-intl", "text": "There are some towns that\u00a0Ukraine\u00a0can just never afford to lose, and Lyptsi is one of them. But the grip\u00a0the\u00a0nation\u00a0keeps is tenuous:\u00a0The streets are aflame from an airstrike moments earlier when we race in, under\u00a0the\u00a0cover of darkness. Night affords them the only\u00a0respite\u00a0from drone assault; the hours before we arrive have seen the town hit eight\u00a0times. Yet the soldiers of the 13th Khartiia National Guard have to endure, as the stakes here are huge. Russia\u2019s relentless onslaught has a key goal:\u00a0If they take Lyptsi, then they can position artillery within range of Ukraine\u2019s second city, Kharkiv, 20 minutes down the road. Down in a bunker, Oleksandr, a commander, looks at one of his many drone feeds. \u201cYou saw yourself how everything is burning. It is like that every night.\u201d His men were among the first to tackle Russia\u2019s new advance into Kharkiv region nearly two weeks ago. He says they are fighting trained professional\u00a0soldiers. \u201cWe can see it from their equipment and tactics,\u201d\u00a0he says. \u201cThey\u2019re not sending just anyone into the assaults.\u201d His stare lengthens when asked about what fortifications were in place before the surprise Russian attack. \u201cNothing was prepared here. Nothing. Just nothing. All the positions are being built by the hands of infantry.\u201d Outside, the night is shaken by more blasts. \u201cThree weeks ago the civilians were living a peaceful life here. Rebuilding, everything was\u00a0all right,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd now most of the houses are ruined.\u201d As we leave, a loud drone buzzes overhead, close by. Our escort does not flinch or run. I ask if the drone is friendly. \u201cHow the f*** should I know?\u201d\u00a0he replies, tugging on a cigarette. All around the city of Kharkiv, home to an estimated million civilians, Ukrainian forces are trying to hold back a persistent Russian assault from multiple angles. Over a week reporting in the villages around the city, CNN saw Ukrainian units holding their positions at great peril and risk, and sometimes using aged and scant artillery to fend off a much better equipped Russian force, able to thwart their most basic\u00a0maneuvers\u00a0with huge numbers of drones. At one position closer to the Russian border, the 92nd Assault Brigade showed CNN a Russian artillery gun, captured in the first days of the war, from which they are now firing French mortar shells. The gun was partially hidden by a wire net, aimed\u00a0at providing\u00a0some protection from an attack drone. Yet above, an\u00a0unidentified scout drone began to hover, forcing the unit to run into a bunker. Another unit\u00a0is\u00a0forced to use a Soviet artillery gun made in the 1940s. Hidden in dense foliage, its metal is rusty in parts, limiting how often it can be fired. Artun, their commander, uses newer Polish shells, but now only fires 10\u00a0a day, when in the autumn it was\u00a0100. Drones are \u201ca big problem,\u201d\u00a0Artun\u00a0says. \u201cI have shrapnel in me as a keepsake,\u201d he adds, referring to the remnants of a Russian Lancet drone still in his hand and stomach, which\u00a0the surgeons could not remove. \u201cBut there are certain actions that can save you from drones.\u201d One of them springs into life: an alert from a $30 frequency scanner on his webbing. It has picked up the approach of another Orlan drone, sending Artun into the bunker. He looks out into the sky above, and sees it pass overhead. He commands a diverse unit, epitomizing the manpower challenges Ukraine is facing in its third year of war. Some, like him, are wounded infantrymen, put on the guns further back from the front. Others are older,\u00a0while\u00a0one of his team is on his first day in artillery. For nearly two years,\u00a0Kharkiv\u00a0thought the threat from its neighbour had passed. A lightning Russian retreat in late 2022 left Kharkiv region peaceful and the launchpad for Ukrainian attacks across the border into Russia proper. Attacks persisted\u00a0in the distance\u00a0however,\u00a0keeping the city\u2019s residents awake through violently loud nights, now amplified by the threat of Russian artillery edging closer. Flares, anti-aircraft fire,\u00a0and blasts regularly punctuate the enforced blackout, as Russian drones, rockets and airstrikes hit targets in the dark. On Wednesday, city officials reported an attack on a gas station, which left four people in hospital.\u00a0On Sunday, two missiles struck a lakeside resort in Cherkaska Lozova, outside the city\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a horrifying attack on a civilian target which also used a \u201cdouble-tap\u201d tactic, in which a second missile hit 10\u00a0minutes after the first, injuring first responders. A few hours after\u00a0Sunday\u2019s\u00a0blasts, rescue workers clambered over the ruins of a waterside terrace,\u00a0retrieving\u00a0two bodies from the seven who died in the attack. One was a woman,\u00a0seven\u00a0months pregnant. Another was only found later, their body fragments in the wreckage. As police combed the eviscerated terrace on the lake for evidence, another air alert sounded, causing half the workers to flee for cover, and some to carry on, almost oblivious.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/europe/ukraine-russia-lyptsi-kharkiv-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_04_17_style_copenhagen-stock-exchange-fire-police-investigation-intl", "text": "Police launched an investigation Wednesday into the fire that tore through Copenhagen\u2019s famous stock exchange building, causing the collapse of its spire and damaging centuries-old artwork and architecture. The blaze was still burning on Wednesday afternoon, more than 24 hours after it began, and authorities and citizens in the Danish capital have started reckoning with the loss of one of the city\u2019s most recognizable landmarks. Local firefighters continued to try to put out the fire, which ripped through\u00a0the building \u2013 known locally as B\u00f8rsen \u2013\u00a0from early Tuesday, reaching all its floors and causing the collapse of a dragon-tail spire that had long been a symbol of the city. The walls of the building are still standing, but the interior has been significantly damaged and the roof is partially collapsed. Firefighters used cranes to hose water down into the building. Copenhagen\u00a0police meanwhile launched an investigation on Wednesday, which they said will be a \u201ccomplicated process.\u201d Police officer Brian Belling said authorities have already \u201cconducted interviews, secured surveillance and carried out a large number of investigative steps.\u201d \u201cBut of course, there is still a lot to do, especially as we have not yet had the opportunity to examine\u00a0B\u00f8rsen itself,\u201d Belling added. The 17th century building exemplified the style of the Dutch Renaissance, and housed a number of artworks, some of which were saved on Tuesday. Residents were stunned by the outbreak, which brought back memories of the fire that tore through the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris exactly five years and a day earlier. \u201cMy first thought was (that) I hope that they rebuild it \u2013 it\u2019s never going to be the same but it\u2019s iconic to\u00a0Copenhagen\u00a0and Denmark,\u201d teacher Eva Simoni Lomholdt, 58, told Reuters. Brian Mikkelsen, the CEO of the Danish Chamber of Commerce which owns the building, told the news agency that a firefighter gave him the top of the spire on Wednesday morning after it was recovered following its fall. \u201cIt gives me hope because we have decided to rebuild the stock exchange because it\u2019s part of European history as a trading continent,\u201d he said. The old stock exchange \u2013 located only a few minutes walk from Christiansborg\u00a0Palace \u2013 dates back to 1625. It was built in the Dutch Renaissance style at the request of King Christian IV and had recently been undergoing renovations with its facade covered in scaffolding and protective coverings. It has been at the heart of Danish business since then; while it no longer houses the Danish stock exchange, it serves as the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce. Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said Tuesday a \u201cpiece of Danish history\u201d was on fire, calling the building \u201cirreplaceable.\u201d Denmark\u2019s culture minister Jakob Engel-Schmidt added that 400 years of cultural heritage had been damaged. \u201cHow touching it is to see how the employees at B\u00f8rsen, good people from the emergency services and passers-by work together to rescue art treasures and iconic images from the burning building,\u201d he said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/17/style/copenhagen-stock-exchange-fire-police-investigation-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_02_style_aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl", "text": "Miami has a new addition to its skyline \u2013 a 66-story residential tower built by Aston Martin, marking the British luxury sports carmaker\u2019s first foray into the residential real estate market. Comprising of 391 units, Aston Martin Residences Miami sits at the mouth of the Miami River on Biscayne Bay, the firm said in a statement Tuesday. Designed in partnership with architect Rodolfo Miani of Bodas Mian Anger and built by G&G Business Developments, the 249-meter- (818-foot-) tall building houses seven penthouses, each with private pools and terraces, as well as apartments ranging in size from one to five bedrooms. The largest unit is the \u201cUnique Triplex Penthouse,\u201d arranged over three floors at the top of the building, which remains on the market for $59 million. The property was officially opened on Tuesday. Timed to coincide with the Formula One Miami Grand Prix, the company said in a statement that it marks \u201cthe latest distinct expression of Aston Martin\u2019s ultra-luxury high performance brand.\u201d Featuring an infinity pool with a pool deck, jacuzzis and cabanas on the 55th floor, the sail-shaped complex has a two-floor fitness center, two movie theaters and a virtual golf simulator. The building has a sky bar and lounge, chef\u2019s kitchen, ballroom and private dining areas, as well as a spa, beauty salon and barber shop. Direct access to the sea via a superyacht marina is also available, plus a private butler service. Germ\u00e1n Coto, chief executive officer of G&G Business Developments, told CNN Tuesday that the firm wanted to work on a project in the \u201ccosmopolitan city\u201d of Miami, and that this piece of land was the perfect choice. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing plot with an excellent view of the river,\u201d said Coto. The structure\u2019s aerodynamic shape helps the building deal with the technical challenges presented by high winds in the area, as well as evoking the sleek shape of an Aston Martin, according to Marek Reichman, executive vice president and chief creative officer of Aston Martin. It also becomes wider from the base to the mid-section before tightening once more towards the top, making it appear to bow out over people on street level, Reichman told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the drama,\u201d he added. Challenges However, the process wasn\u2019t all plain sailing. \u201cIt was difficult to achieve what we wanted because the space and the plot is kind of small,\u201d said Coto, with the building fitting into a 1.25-acre plot of land. Meanwhile, local building regulations imposed strict standards, explained Reichman, taking into account the low-lying land and propensity for flooding. \u201cThey were some of the most amazing challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to withstand the flooding with the windows that are on street level.\u201d There were further obstacles due to the curved shape of the building, which means that units on the east side have an individual architectural structural component. Aston Martin touches Homeowners are able to customize their interior space with the help of the Aston Martin design team, with three style packages \u2013 Timeless, Covert and Indulgent \u2013 drawing on the company\u2019s British heritage, as well as the building\u2019s context. \u201cIt needs to have part of the DNA of an Aston Martin,\u201d Reichman said. \u201cBut we are in Miami, you don\u2019t have a cold November evening where you need to put the log fire on, so you\u2019ve got to be considerate of the environment that you\u2019re in.\u201d Design elements running through the building include doors with bespoke Aston Martin handles, number plinths and kestrel tan leather door tabs. Aston Martin said that 99% of the properties sold before the building was completed. Residences were sold for $1.5 million to $8.5 million, while penthouses ranged from $16 million to $59 million. The Unique Triplex Penthouse, on the market for $59 million, comes with the last remaining Aston Martin Vulcan, an 820 brake horsepower all-carbon fiber supercar, of which only 24 exist, a spokesman for the company said. Meanwhile, buyers of the 47 Signature and Penthouse units were also able to choose between an Aston Martin DBX sports SUV or the company\u2019s DB11 sportscar. Aston Martin isn\u2019t the first luxury carmaker to enter the residential property market. A 63-story building from Bentley will open in 2026 along the coastline of Sunny Isles Beach, Florida. Featuring 216 units, the property will have an elevator designed to take residents up to their doorstep while seated inside their cars.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/02/style/aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_tech_microsoft-ai-tool-privacy-recall", "text": "Microsoft\u2019s buzziest new AI feature is raising concerns that it could potentially be misused in the wrong hands. This week, the company showed off a new tool called Recall for Windows computers that acts as a personal \u201ctime machine,\u201d allowing users to quickly pull up anything that\u2019s ever been on screen, such as documents, images and websites. It\u2019s different from a keyword search; the tool regularly saves screenshots of the user\u2019s screen and stores them directly on the device. It then uses AI to process the data and make it searchable. For example, if someone previously searched for a green dress or the name of a local ice cream shop, they can ask the feature to \u201crecall\u201d anything in their history that was shown on screen. Although so-called semantic search is a big step forward for AI, it comes at a time when the industry is moving so quickly and government regulators, companies and consumers are still figuring out how to use the technology responsibly. Jen Golbeck \u2013 a professor of AI at the University of Maryland who focuses on privacy\u00a0\u2013 said the recall feature could pose a potential \u201cnightmare\u201d if the device falls into the wrong hands. \u201cStuff may stay on your device, but that doesn\u2019t mean people can\u2019t get to it,\u201d she said. \u201cYou won\u2019t have an option to protect yourself even if you use incognito mode or clear your history because the tool has access to everything that\u2019s been on your screen.\u201d The UK\u2019s independent regulator for Data Protection and Freedom of Information, the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO), told CNN it is investigating the tool \u201cto understand the safeguards in place to protect user privacy.\u201d \u201cWe expect organisations to be transparent with users about how their data is being used and only process personal data to the extent that it is necessary to achieve a specific purpose,\u201d the ICO said in a statement. Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment. CEO Satya Nadella told The Wall Street Journal in an interview ahead of Monday\u2019s launch that web searches must only be done on Microsoft\u2019s Edge web browser and that the screenshots never leave the user\u2019s computer. \u201cYou have to put two things together: This is my computer and this is my Recall \u2013 and it\u2019s all being done locally,\u201d he said. Geoff Blaber, CEO of market research firm CCS Insight, said that makes the issue less concerning. \u201cThe backlash by some to this feature isn\u2019t surprising, but it\u2019s an overreaction given that the data stays exclusively on the device and the user has full control,\u201d Blaber said. Someone can decide whether to turn the feature on during the device setup process and can customize and blacklist which apps and websites Recall can access. \u201cThese controls suggest the feature has been built with security and privacy at its core,\u201d he said. \u201cRecall won\u2019t appeal to everyone but the utility provided is likely to be significant.\u201d Potential for malicious uses But Golbeck cited times when that protection might not be enough, such as a journalist in a hostile country, a person trying to get out of an abusive relationship, someone searching for sensitive medical information or an employee whose boss wants to track them. She believes issues around the tool will likely impact the workplace the most. \u201cWe know jobs monitor what we\u2019re doing on their devices, but a lot of people will do a personal thing on their work computer and all of that will be archived and visible to an IT department, even if it just stays on device,\u201d she added. Golbeck said technology, despite the benefits, is too often developed without the consideration of malicious uses. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen over the last 15 years is every single one of those potential malicious use cases comes to fruition in some way or another,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople will want to use this cool feature without understanding the privacy risk \u2013 that there will be a permanent record of everything you do.\u201d Similar reactions to features such as biometric passwords, such as fingerprints, facial recognition and iris scans, have emerged in the past. Blaber said to overcome some of the initial concerns, Microsoft and its partners will need to prove the value, security and privacy of the product in the real world. Still, Michela Menting, a senior research director at ABI Research, believes the feature is a \u201cstep backwards\u201d for privacy. \u201cThe argument that hackers need physical access to even be able to manipulate Recall is short-sighted at best because there are plenty of highly ingenious ways threat actors could exploit such a valuable tool,\u201d she said. \u201cAll it takes is time and effort to find a way.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/tech/microsoft-ai-tool-privacy-recall/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "world"}}

Tyler Wenrich, a 31-year-old American, pleaded guilty to\u00a0two counts of ammunition possession during a court hearing on Tuesday morning, Dr. Angela Brooks, deputy director of public prosecutions in Turks and Caicos, told CNN. Wenrich is one of five Americans arrested in recent months in the British Overseas Territory, where carrying firearms is prohibited. The Americans carried the ammunition in their luggage \u201cinadvertently,\u201d according to American lawmakers, and now face up to a dozen years in prison. Wenrich\u2019s hearing comes on the heels of a push from a bipartisan group of US lawmakers who traveled to Turks and Caicos to press for their release \u2013 but encountered resistance from officials on the island, the lawmakers announced Monday. Republican Sen. Markwayne Mullin led the trip, which also was attended by Democratic Sen. John Fetterman and GOP Reps. Guy Reschenthaler, Josh Brecheen, Michael Cloud and Bob Good. The lawmakers met with Turks and Caicos officials, including the governor, attorney general, minister of tourism and police leaders, the statement from Mullin\u2019s office said. \u201cUnfortunately, despite our willingness to work with Turks and Caicos officials to get our constituents home, we were not able to find a path forward today,\u201d Mullin said in the statement. \u201cAt this point, well-intentioned American citizens are facing a dozen years in prison all for unknowingly having one or two bullets in their luggage.\u201d \u201cShould they receive a prison sentence, we will need to consider additional actions to safeguard American citizens,\u201d Mullin said. The other detained Americans have been identified as Sharitta Grier, 45; Michael Lee Evans, 72; Bryan Hagerich and Ryan Tyler Watson, 40. Each is accused of bringing various amounts of ammunition to the chain of 40 islands in the tropical Atlantic Ocean southeast of the Bahamas. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Manu Raju Tuesday, Mullin said a sentencing hearing is scheduled for Hagerich on Friday. The judge in the case is set to hand down Wenrich\u2019s sentence on May 28, Brooks said. According to Brooks, an expedited application was submitted on behalf of Watson, who will also have a hearing on May 28. Bringing firearms or ammunition, including stray bullets, into Turks and Caicos without prior permission from police is \u201cstrictly forbidden,\u201d according to a statement from its government. People who violate the law face a minimum of 12 years in prison, the US Embassy in the Bahamas said in an April advisory. Judges can lower the minimum sentence and adjust fines when there are \u201cexceptional circumstances,\u201d the Turks and Caicos attorney general said in a news release earlier this month.

At night, the pale lavender petals close, providing a safe resting place. In the morning, as birdsong rings out across the desert, the flower opens, revealing its tenant. Here in southern California, in the middle of the Mojave Desert\u2019s vast and arid landscape, it\u2019s just one of many natural treasures hidden from view. In long sleeves, pants, and wide-brimmed hats to guard against a harsh sun in a cloudless blue sky, a team of four led by Madena Asbell crouches in the dirt, looking for another treasure. They are searching for a plant called erodium texanum, (common names Texas stork\u2019s bill or heronbill), a type of herb native to California. More specifically, they are looking for its seeds. \u201cThere\u2019s so much life here,\u201d Asbell says, \u201cbut it\u2019s easy to not realize that when you\u2019re in the desert.\u201d Asbell is the director of plant conservation for the Mojave Desert Land Trust (MDLT), a non-profit land conservancy that works to preserve and protect the Mojave and Colorado desert landscapes of California. A quarter of the state is desert, home to roughly 2,400 plant species, according to MDLT. Eight years ago, Asbell had an idea. What if there was a way to preserve the ecosystem, centered around the seeds that facilitate all the life here? The result was the Mojave Desert Land Trust seed bank. \u201cThe goal is to preserve this amazing genetic diversity that we have and make it available for restoration or reintroduction of species, should there be a disaster that wipes out a population,\u201d Asbell says. \u201cPlants are the foundation of most ecosystems, so when we protect these plants, we\u2019re protecting everything that depends on them, like desert tortoise, burrowing owls and pollinators.\u201d Five million seeds, and counting In an ever-changing climate, the seed bank was just the type of \u201cproactive\u201d idea the organization was looking for, says Kelly Herbinson, executive director of MDLT. \u201cAs a land trust, we\u2019re realizing that just protecting land or buying land to protect it wasn\u2019t going to be enough \u2013 that we had to take extra steps to really invest in that land,\u201d Herbinson says. In 2016, Mojave Desert Land Trust officially launched the seed bank project, which has since been described as a \u201cNoah\u2019s Ark\u201d for southern California. Three white refrigerators at MDLT headquarters in Joshua Tree, California, house the collection. There are over 5 million seeds from nearly 250 species and counting, according to the land trust. Seeds come in from the field teams and undergo a \u201ccut test\u201d to determine viability \u2013 confirming the seed pods are full, and that there hasn\u2019t been too much damage from insects or mold, making the seeds worth saving. They then go into paper bags on racks to dry out, before going into jars in the refrigerators for long-term storage. All types of jar shapes and sizes pack the shelves inside, from small, donated Gerber baby food jars to larger pickle jars \u2013 each adorned with white labels including seed name, number of jars in the collection, and number of seeds. Much like the desert itself, the seed bank contains all kinds of variation. Some seeds are light and wispy; some are skinny or round. Others are denser, like peppercorn, while another resembles pumpkin seed. There are shades of brown, red and olive green. Asbell says that work at the seed bank includes scouting, collecting, processing and database management. Last year, MDLT received a $3.2 million grant from the state of California\u2019s Wildlife Conservation Board to help expand the project. \u201cWe\u2019ve already been able to provide seed to researchers who are studying the effects of climate change on specific species that we have in our seed bank,\u201d Asbell adds. \u201cAnd knowing not only what you\u2019ve collected, but where it has come from in a really specific way is very important for restoration. \u201cYou can\u2019t just throw any seeds on the ground \u2026 You need to know where that seed has come from, what population, what elevation, and make sure that it\u2019s the right seed for the right place. Those are things that we are able to do through the work that we\u2019re doing.\u201d Helping the future of the Joshua tree There is an increased urgency to that work. California has felt the impacts of climate change, from more frequent and intense wildfires, says Herbinson, to an influx of invasive grasses that are not only choking parts of the desert landscape but acting as fuel for the wildfires. \u201cClimate change brings drought and more prolonged drought, which really stresses desert ecosystems, even though they are adapted for aridity,\u201d Asbell says. \u201cWe\u2019re facing really unprecedented challenges that threaten our existence and to be able to preserve the genetic diversity of the planet for a future time when it may be needed is really amazing \u2013 it\u2019s really critical work,\u201d she adds. The desert itself is \u201cthe kind of place where you can pass it by and look at it and think there\u2019s nothing there,\u201d Herbinson says. \u201cBut in reality, it\u2019s incredibly biodiverse and full of so much life. It\u2019s just secret and hidden in ways that aren\u2019t obvious.\u201d That means it\u2019s not as well protected as other ecosystems, she adds, such as rainforests or oceans \u2013 which come with more colorful trees and wildlife. Yet the Mojave Desert boasts an iconic tree of its own: the Joshua tree. \u201cWe have this incredible endemic species that\u2019s very charismatic and has this very kind of unusual structure to it,\u201d Asbell says. \u201cIt\u2019s widespread across the landscape, but also very threatened and so we\u2019re very concerned about the future of the Joshua tree and working really hard to protect it.\u201d A type of yucca, the twisted, Dr. Seuss-like tree, which lends its name to a national park in the same area is \u201cnot likely to persist through our changing climate,\u201d Herbinson agrees, \u201cbecause their seeds are dispersed largely by rodents.\u201d To survive, there will likely come a time when the trees will need to migrate to a more \u201csuitable habitat,\u201d she adds \u2013 ideally cooler and at higher elevation. But that distance is beyond the range of the rodents, who only disperse seeds up to 100 feet from the tree. That\u2019s where the seed bank could help. \u201cIt means we can help the Joshua tree migrate potentially faster than it would naturally, and have that species survive the changing climate well into the future in a way that it wouldn\u2019t if we weren\u2019t doing that work,\u201d Herbinson says. Roughly 70,000 Joshua tree seeds are currently preserved in the seed bank, some of which could be planted in cooler locations, if needed. The key, according to Asbell, is balance: taking just the right amount to sustain a restoration project in the event of an emergency, but not so much as to disrupt the natural ecosystem. \u201cThis is an ancient landscape, she says. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty profound to think about how long-lived a lot of these organisms are, and how much history they\u2019ve experienced.\u201d \u201cSeeds are life,\u201d Asbell adds, \u201cand I don\u2019t know that anything brings me as much pleasure as growing a seed. \u2026 It\u2019s life affirming. And in the world we live in today, you have to really hold onto that and keep that close.\u201d CNN\u2019s Adeline Chen contributed reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/world/americas/mojave-desert-seed-bank-mdlt-california-climate-c2e-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_climate_supreme-court-epa-biden-trump", "text": "President Joe Biden\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency threw down a gauntlet on climate this spring, pushing carmakers toward electric vehicles, cracking down on natural gas leaks and forcing power plants to get their planet-warming pollution under control. The new rules could prevent billions of tons of climate pollution from entering the atmosphere from America\u2019s dirtiest industries \u2013 pollution that is rapidly warming the planet, spurring record heatwaves and supercharging storms. But only if they can survive the nation\u2019s highest court. The 6-3 conservative Supreme Court majority is casting a long shadow over the EPA\u2019s agenda, with a \u201chair trigger\u201d on cases involving the agency, longtime environmental attorney and Harvard Law School professor Richard Lazarus told CNN. \u201cThere\u2019s no question there\u2019s high skepticism that many of the justices harbor about EPA\u2019s rules and regulations,\u201d he added.\u201d Over the last three years, the EPA has tried to Supreme Court-proof its rules, hewing as close to the law as it can get. The agency\u2019s authority to regulate greenhouse gases from power plants was curbed \u2013 but not taken away entirely \u2013 in a 2022 case. Speaking to environmental journalists at a conference in April, EPA administrator Michael Regan said his staff is \u201cvery attentive\u201d to how the Supreme Court \u201cis responding.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re trying to now design more robust rules in response to the environment that we\u2019re in,\u201d Regan added. EPA is being exceedingly careful with all its language, aware that even its media releases may be picked apart by legal opponents. The news releases and Regan\u2019s remarks the agency released to announce four recent actions on the power sector were crafted in a way to avoid stirring the legal pot and not overstep EPA\u2019s authority, a source familiar with the process told CNN \u2013 a remarkable example of the intense scrutiny the agency is under. The EPA is already facing legal challenges on nearly every major rule it has enacted, largely from Republican states and the fossil fuel industry. Now it is facing likely challenges from the same cast of characters on the EV and power plant regulations, in which any Supreme Court action could have global repercussions: The US is the world\u2019s second-largest polluter behind China, and the EPA is the main agency setting and enforcing rules of the road for its dirtiest industries. The EPA is attempting to thread the smallest of needles: write lasting regulations in a way that will survive a Supreme Court that multiple legal experts described as \u201chostile.\u201d The agency is \u201ctrying to avoid anything remotely novel,\u201d Lazarus said. \u201cThey do no one any favor if they pass a rule that flies in the face of what the court has said and then the rule after three or four years is invalidated.\u201d The court\u2019s conservatives vs. EPA Legal experts view the court\u2019s 6-person conservative majority as divided into two camps on environmental issues: three justices who are seen as reliable votes against the EPA, and three who \u2013 while not necessarily swing votes \u2013 are more of a question mark. Justices Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch make up the reliable anti-EPA wing of the bench, experts say. \u201cThose are the three who you count on to be the most hostile to regulation, and Gorsuch and Alito in particular, about environmental regulation,\u201d David Doniger, a senior federal strategist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, told CNN. \u201cAlito \u2013 you can hear it in the way he writes opinions, you can hear it in his questions,\u201d Lazarus said. \u201cIn arguments he is skeptical, often mocking, of the environmental position.\u201d Thomas\u2019s position, based on deep skepticism of federal authority and deep beliefs in states\u2019 rights, is another staunch anti-EPA vote, if not with as much open derision as Alito. Then there\u2019s Gorsuch, the son of Reagan-appointed EPA administrator Anne Gorsuch, who oversaw a period of anti-environmental regulations during her tenure before being forced to resign. Now, Justice Gorsuch is angling to blow up the federal regulatory process as we know it. He is widely seen as a lead advocate for overturning a 1984 decision known as the Chevron deference \u2013 a legal test that gives federal agencies wide latitude to put forth regulations and compels courts to defer to agencies in many cases. The court\u2019s three remaining conservatives \u2013 Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett \u2013 certainly aren\u2019t friends of EPA, but the level of their opposition isn\u2019t as clear-cut. Roberts wrote an opinion in 2022\u2019s West Virginia v. EPA case preserving the agency\u2019s authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, however more narrowly. And environmental attorneys are intrigued by Barrett, who has had some tough questions for EPA\u2019s challengers during recent Supreme Court arguments. Justice Brett Kavanaugh stands out the most among the group. Kavanaugh\u2019s background is steeped in regulations and administrative law from a stint on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, the court that hears challenges on federal regulations. But environmental law experts don\u2019t view Kavanaugh as hardline as Alito or Gorsuch, citing his notable departure from the conservative wing on the court\u2019s decision in the 2023 case Sackett v. EPA, in which the court stripped the Clean Water Act of much of its power. \u201cHe\u2019s got some animus towards environmental regulation, but it doesn\u2019t run as consistent and deep,\u201d said Doniger. \u201cHe\u2019s unpredictable, but he\u2019s not completely ungettable.\u201d The coming legal challenges The EPA is now facing headwinds from all directions. One legal challenge to the agency\u2019s rules on car pollution\u00a0has been tossed by the DC Circuit, while another is still pending. Red states most recently filed a separate challenge to the agency\u2019s pollution rules for heavy-duty trucks. The Supreme Court ruled in 2007 that the EPA can use its authority to regulate greenhouse gases. But the court has overturned years of precedent before, including on blockbuster issues like abortion. Even if the Supreme Court doesn\u2019t fully overturn its 2007 ruling, its conservative majority is steadily eroding the EPA\u2019s ability to regulate pollution, legal experts told CNN. \u201cI think we\u2019re operating in a world where there\u2019s a majority of the court that is skeptical of the power of EPA to regulate greenhouse gases, even though the court has decided that question,\u201d said Ann Carlson, an environmental law professor at the University of California Los Angeles and a former high-ranking Biden administration transportation official. \u201cIn two different instances, the court has viewed (the EPA\u2019s) power as narrow, even though it exists. Then the question is, how narrow is narrow?\u201d While the EPA and other agencies face an existential threat from the Chevron decision this summer, conservatives are attacking from another angle \u2013 using an obscure legal premise known as major questions doctrine to further poke holes in the agency\u2019s authority. The major questions doctrine, revived during West Virginia v. EPA, says agencies can\u2019t regulate on something that Congress hasn\u2019t given them explicit authority to do. Major questions is being used \u201cmore aggressively than it has in the past,\u201d Carlson said, adding she thinks it is a larger threat to the EPA than Chevron. Major questions, if used often and effectively to attack the EPA and other agencies, could render them useless because it argues they cannot operate without Congress passing laws explicitly giving them approval to do things. And given extreme political polarization, things often move at a glacial pace in Congress. There is one glimmer of hope for the EPA; Congress recently passed a major climate bill, doling out hundreds of billions in tax credits to get American to buy cleaner cars, give enormous tax incentives to companies to capture power, oil companies to tighten methane leaks. That gives the agency the recent Congressional direction the Supreme Court has said it so badly needs, some experts said. \u201cCongress has freshly legislated,\u201d said Doniger. \u201cYou can\u2019t get much clearer than that.\u201d In addition to pouring billions of subsidies into clean energy projects and EVs, Democrats also used the Inflation Reduction Act to explicitly update language in the Clean Air Act \u2013 labeling planet-warming greenhouse gases as one of the forms of pollution covered by the law. However, legal experts CNN spoke to were split on how effective those protections would be under the eyes of the courts. Some, like Doniger, were optimistic it could be an effective shield. \u201cThe court is saying we want to see Congress clear indication of what it wants to do, and we also disfavor old laws,\u201d Doniger said. \u201cHere you have a 2022 law.\u201d Lazarus is more skeptical the court will be persuaded by the fact that Congress is \u201cjust giving money\u201d and that the IRA amendment to the Clean Air Act has \u201climited reach.\u201d \u201cWe have increasing problems and new things require congressional intention, and Congress has basically stopped making laws,\u201d Lazarus said. EPA \u201ccan\u2019t afford to wait to Congress gets its act together.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/climate/supreme-court-epa-biden-trump/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "world"}}
