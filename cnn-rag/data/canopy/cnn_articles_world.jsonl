The Princess of Wales, her husband William, their children George, Charlotte and Louis gathered together with King Charles and Queen Camilla to watch a Royal Air Force flypast. They waved and smiled at the crowd, who responded with cheers. The Princess, also known as Kate, was earlier driven in a state carriage with her children from Buckingham Palace to Horse Guards Parade to watch the celebration, known as Trooping the Colour. She could be seen wearing an Irish Guards regimental broach, a nod towards her role as their honorary colonel. The family were later seen watching events from a viewing point, while Kate\u2019s husband William, the Prince of Wales, rode on horseback. For Kate, it was her first public appearance since Christmas Day \u2013 weeks before her cancer diagnosis. Kate stepped away from public duties in January, following what Kensington Palace said at the time was surgery for a non-cancerous abdominal condition. In March, amid speculation about her wellbeing, she revealed she had been diagnosed with cancer after the operation, and was undergoing treatment. King Charles III and Queen Camilla were also taken in a carriage from Buckingham Palace, bringing cheers from the packed crowds as they made their way slowly up The Mall. The King took part riding a carriage rather than on horseback this year due to his own cancer diagnosis. People of all ages gathered along the length of the Mall for the event. Some onlookers are wearing Union Jack bucket hats and fascinators, while others are waving flags. Some sang the national anthem. Kate gave an update on her health on Friday, saying she had made \u201cgood progress\u201d in her recovery. But she said she expected her treatment to last for a few more months and was \u201cnot out of the woods yet.\u201d Trooping the Colour is the magnificent military spectacle which sees 1,400 officers and soldiers, together with 400 musicians and 200 horses, process through the streets of London from Buckingham Palace to Horse Guard\u2019s Parade, while crowds line the route. The event - one of the highlights of the royal calendar - is a tradition marking the official birthday of the British sovereign for more than 260 years. However, Charles\u2019s actual birthday is in November. Britain\u2019s Kings and Queens have doubled up on their festivities since the 18th century, holding both a public celebration \u2013 the official birthday \u2013 and a more private event on the real date. The tradition is believed to have started with the party-mad King George II in 1748. Like Charles III, George was born in November, when British weather is often far from ideal. Proving that point, the weather took a downward turn as events neared their end. Crowds waiting for the King to arrive back at the palace were lashed with heavy rain and gusts of wind. Some onlookers struggled to hold their umbrellas in place. Speaking about Kate\u2019s appearance on the balcony, David Betteridge, 66, told CNN that \u201cshe looked well so hopefully that is a good sign.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s really nice to see her back actually,\u201d he added. \u201cFor the most part we stayed dry. But we got pretty wet just after the ceremony when the parade had finished. It rained very hard.\u201d Anna Yang, 30, who was visiting the UK from China on holiday, said she saw the flypast from her hotel nearby. \u201cIt was great. It\u2019s our first time, even in our own country, seeing all the national aircraft going through the sky,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cIt was incredible.\u201d But anti-royalists turned out too, some of whom chanted \u201cshame\u201d and \u201cnot my king!\u201d This year\u2019s proceedings were adapted as the 75-year-old Charles continues his treatment for an unspecified form of cancer. Doctors have been encouraged by his progress, allowing him to resume public-facing duties in April, but each engagement he carries out is reviewed and adapted where appropriate. For the events on Saturday, he carried out his review of troops seated in an Ascot landau carriage alongside Queen Camilla. Three of the British Army\u2019s horses which bolted across in London in April returned to duty and took part in this weekend\u2019s birthday parade. The two remaining horses \u201care enjoying a summer holiday in the Chilterns\u201d and will return to service in due course, according to the army.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/15/uk/trooping-the-colour-princess-kate-intl-scli-gbr/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_19_sport_albania-croatia-germany-hungary-scotland-switzerland-euro-2024-spt-intl", "text": "Germany star Jamal Musiala continued his brilliant form at Euro 2024, scoring in the host\u2019s 2-0 win against Hungary on Wednesday. The 21-year-old\u2019s well-taken strike in the 22nd minute also helped maintain his nation\u2019s unbeaten streak in Group A, as Germany qualified for the knockout stages of the competition with a game to spare. Ilkay G\u00fcndo\u011fan doubled his team\u2019s lead in the 67th minute, calmly finishing off a well-worked goal. Germany, though, was tested by Hungary at the Stuttgart Arena but the underdog was unable to take any of its chances in front of goal. Musiala now has two goals at the tournament, netting his first during Germany\u2019s 5-1 demolition of Scotland on Friday. Soccer\u2019s new star Born in Germany, Musiala moved to the United Kingdom with his family as a child and it was in London where he started his football education. Musiala quickly started playing for Chelsea\u2019s academy whilst also attending Whitgift \u2013 an independent school in south London that has a history of helping develop players that have gone on to become outstanding professionals, notably Callum Hudson-Odoi and former Nigeria international Victor Moses. Speaking to CNN Sport in 2021, Musiala\u2019s old school coach said the youngster\u2019s ability was clear to see from an early age. \u201cI think from the outset, Jamal was always marked out for greatness. Jamal just stood out, his goalscoring was phenomenal,\u201d Andrew Martin, Whitgift\u2019s director of soccer, said. Musiala then moved back to Germany in 2019, signing for Bayern Munich. At just 17, he became the club\u2019s youngest ever Champions League goalscorer and went on to cement his place in Germany\u2019s national team, despite previously playing for England\u2019s youth teams. Now considered one of the most exciting attacking midfielders in the world, Musiala has been a stand out performer at Euro 2024, a tournament in which Germany is starting to look very threatening. \u201cHe\u2019s going to lead Germany to glory one day,\u201d Darmstadt coach Torsten Lieberknecht said earlier this season, after Musiala dismantled his side in a 5-2 loss to Bayern Munich. Germany will hope to continue its unbeaten run when it faces Switzerland in its final Group A game on Sunday, but one eye will now be on the round of 16. Group A: Scotland and Switzerland draw Elsewhere in Group A, Scotland and Switzerland battled to a hard-fought 1-1 draw later on Wednesday. Manchester United midfielder Scott McTominay scored the opening goal for Scotland in the 13th minute, his shot taking a huge deflection off Fabian Schar on its way to the goal. Switzerland found the equalzier 13 minutes later as Xherdan Shaqiri punished Scotland for some sloppy passing, curing a long-range effort into the top corner after picking up on a loose ball. Both teams can still qualify for the knockout stages. Scotland will face Hungary and Switzerland plays Germany on Sunday. Group B: Albania rescues dramatic draw Albania scored a stoppage-time equalizer to rescue a 2-2 draw against Croatia on Wednesday, a result which keeps its Euro 2024 campaign alive. Klaus Gjasula\u2019s 95th-minute strike capped off a thrilling encounter inside Hamburg\u2019s Volksparkstadion stadium, as this year\u2019s European Championships continues to deliver dramatic action and plot twists. The No. 66 in FIFA\u2019s world rankings, Albania had taken a surprise lead in the first half through Qazim Laci, but Croatia equalized in the 74th minute thanks to Andrej Kramari\u0107\u2019s composed finish. Just two minutes later and Croatia took the lead with the most fortunate of goals. Albania\u2019s defenders did well to block a shot but the ball ricocheted off Klaus Gjasula who inadvertently scored the cruellest of own goals. Having lost its opening game against Italy, the defeat would have left Albania on the brink of elimination from the tournament, but there was one more twist to come. With the clock ticking down, Gjasula redeemed himself in the final moments, leveling the score with a calm finish which sparked jubilant scenes from Albania\u2019s traveling fans. Croatia, ranked 56 places higher than Albania, looked disappointed by the result at full-time but a draw was probably a fair result. Albania now sits third in Group B with one point, ahead of Croatia only on goal difference. Italy and Spain are set to play each other in the other group match on Thursday.

At least 41 Jordanians, 35 Tunisians and 11 Iranians are among the dead, according to authorities in each country. A further 22 Jordanians are missing and 26 Iranians have been hospitalized, the Iranian Red Crescent announced Wednesday, according to Iran\u2019s semi-official Tasnim news agency. Some of the Iranians died due to heatstroke while others had underlying conditions, the Iranian Red Crescent said. The death toll is likely to rise, as Saudi Arabia and Egypt have yet to release official figures. Additionally, the governments are only aware of pilgrims who have registered and traveled to Mecca as part of their country\u2019s quota \u2013 more deaths are feared among unregistered pilgrims. The Saudi government said on Monday that more than 2,700 people had been treated for heatstroke. Meanwhile, hundreds of people have taken to social media to post about their loved ones being unaccounted for. More than\u00a01.8 million people\u00a0are taking part in this year\u2019s Hajj, one of the world\u2019s largest religious gatherings, according to the Saudi General Authority for Statistics. While deaths among pilgrims are not uncommon (there were more than 200 last year), this year\u2019s gathering is being held amid particularly high temperatures. Hajj season changes every year according to the Islamic calendar and this year it fell in June, one of the hottest months in the Kingdom. On Monday, Saudi Arabia advised pilgrims against performing the \u2018stoning of the devil\u2019 ritual between certain hours after temperatures reached an extreme 49 degrees Celsius (120 degrees Fahrenheit). Hajj officials have also been asking pilgrims to carry umbrellas and stay hydrated amid the harsh conditions while the Saudi army has deployed more than 1,600 personnel with medical units specifically for heatstroke and 30 rapid response teams. Another 5,000 health and first aid volunteers are taking part. Performing Hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam, which requires every Muslim who is physically and financially able to make the journey to the holy city of Mecca at least once in his or her life. The pilgrimage includes numerous detailed rituals including wearing a special garment that symbolizes human equality and unity before God, a circular, counter-clockwise procession around the Kaaba, and the symbolic stoning of evil.

{"id": "2024_06_19_asia_south-china-sea-philippines-injury-intl-hnk", "text": "Manila has accused China of injuring Filipino personnel and damaging Philippine vessels during a South China Sea collision earlier this week, as tensions simmer over territorial disputes in the resource-rich and strategically important waterway. The Philippines and China have both blamed each other for the clash Monday near Second Thomas Shoal in the contested\u00a0Spratly Islands, with a statement from the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs on Wednesday providing the first official confirmation from either side that injuries and damage were sustained. It follows multiple reports of injuries to Filipino sailors carried in local media and the Associated Press, citing sources, as well as from US officials. The Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs \u201cdenounces the illegal and aggressive actions of Chinese authorities that resulted in personnel injury and vessel damage,\u201d the statement said, without specifying how many sailors were wounded or providing any details of their injuries. At least eight\u00a0Filipinos were injured in the incident \u2013 including one sailor who lost a thumb,\u00a0the AP reported Tuesday, citing an official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. CNN has reached out to the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Philippine Coast Guard for comment. Chinese state-run tabloid Global Times published photos of the incident online on Wednesday, showing a Philippine rigid-hulled inflatable boat sandwiched between a large China Coast Guard vessel and at least three other Chinese boats. When asked about the incident in a news conference on Wednesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said, \u201claw enforcement measures taken by the Chinese Coast Guard on the spot were professional and restrained, aimed at stopping the illegal fishing by Philippine ships, and no direct measures were taken against Philippine personnel.\u201d The incident Monday is the latest in a string of confrontations between Chinese and Philippine ships that have raised the possibility of the South China Sea becoming a flashpoint for global conflict. It comes just weeks after Philippine President Ferdinand \u201cBongbong\u201d Marcos Jr.\u00a0warned\u00a0that the death of any Filipino citizen at the hands of another country in the waterway would be \u201cvery close\u201d to an act of war. Marcos has sought closer ties with the US, which\u00a0has repeatedly stressed Washington\u2019s \u201cironclad commitment\u201d to a 1951 mutual defense treaty between the US and the Philippines that stipulates both sides would help defend each other if either were attacked by a third party. China claims \u201cindisputable sovereignty\u201d over almost all of the South China Sea, and most of the islands and sandbars within it, including many features that are hundreds of miles from mainland China. Multiple governments, including Manila, hold competing claims. In 2016, an international tribunal in The Hague ruled in favor of the Philippines in a landmark maritime dispute, which concluded that China has no legal basis to claim historic rights to the bulk of the South China Sea. But Beijing has ignored the ruling. Instead it has increasingly pushed its maritime territorial claims, with China Coast Guard ships \u2013 reinforced by militia boats \u2013 involved in multiple clashes over the past year that have damaged Philippine ships and seen\u00a0Filipino sailors injured by water cannon. Known as Ayungin Shoal in the Philippines and Ren\u2019ai Jiao in China, Second Thomas Shoal is a submerged teardrop-shaped reef\u00a0located about 200 kilometers (125 miles) from the Philippine island of Palawan. It lies in the Spratly Islands, a mostly uninhabited archipelago where oil and gas reserves have been found, and which is claimed by China, the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan. The Philippines carried a resupply on Monday to its soldiers stationed on the BRP Sierra Madre, a rusting US-built Philippine Navy landing craft that was run aground deliberately in 1999, with a national flag hoisted on board, to assert Manila\u2019s territorial claims over Second Thomas Shoal. The China Coast Guard on Monday said a Philippine supply ship \u201cignored China\u2019s repeated solemn warnings\u201d and \u201cdeliberately and dangerously\u201d approached a Chinese vessel in \u201can unprofessional manner,\u201d resulting in a collision. A supply ship and two rubber boats from the Philippines had attempted to \u201cillegally\u201d deliver supplies to the stranded warship, China Coast Guard spokesperson Gan Yu\u00a0said. China\u2019s Coast Guard also said it took measures including \u201cwarnings and interceptions, boarding inspections and forced evictions\u201d against the Philippine vessels. Multiple US officials criticized China\u2019s actions Monday and stressed Washington\u2019s support for\u00a0Manila. The \u201cUnited States stands with its ally the Philippines and condemns the escalatory and irresponsible actions\u201d by China, US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/asia/south-china-sea-philippines-injury-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_15_europe_sweden-iran-prisoner-swap-intl", "text": "Sweden and Iran carried out a prisoner exchange on Saturday, officials said, with Sweden freeing a former Iranian official convicted for his role in a mass execution in the 1980s while Iran released two Swedes being held there. The prisoner swap was mediated by Oman, the country\u2019s foreign ministry said in a statement. \u201cOmani efforts resulted in the two sides agreeing on a mutual release, as those released were transferred from Tehran and Stockholm,\u201d it said. Sweden had freed convicted former Iranian official Hamid Noury, Iran\u2019s top human rights official said on X. Noury, who had been convicted for his part in a mass execution of political prisoners in Iran in 1988, would be back in Iran in a few hours, the official added. Separately, Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said in a statement that Swedish citizens Johan Floderus and Saeed Azizi who had been detained in Iran were on a plane back to Sweden. \u201cIran used them both as pawns in a cynical negotiations game with the purpose of getting the Iranian citizen Hamid Noury released from prison in Sweden. He is convicted of serious crimes committed in Iran in the 1980s,\u201d Kristersson said. \u201cAs prime minister I have a special responsibility for Swedish citizens\u2019 safety. The government has therefore worked intensively on the issue, together with the Swedish security services which have negotiated with Iran.\u201d Kristersson confirmed in a video released by the government that Noury was now being transported back to Iran. Kristersson declined to give further details around the considerations, citing security concerns. Noury, 63, was arrested at a Stockholm airport in 2019 and later sentenced to life in prison for war crimes for the mass execution and torture of political prisoners at the Gohardasht prison in Karaj, Iran, in 1988. He denied the charges. The National Council of Resistance of Iran, a coalition of groups opposed to Iran\u2019s Islamic Republic government, said it appeared Sweden had yielded to blackmail and hostage-taking tactics in a move that would encourage Tehran. Floderus, a European Union employee, was arrested in Iran in 2022 and charged with spying for Israel and \u201ccorruption on earth,\u201d a crime that carries the death penalty.

{"id": "2024_05_25_style_zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk", "text": "Above Beijing\u2019s imperial center rises Jingshan, or Prospect Hill. From a pagoda at its modest peak, a panoramic view of the city presents itself. To the south, the dull golden roofs of the Forbidden City crest and fall, pulling the eye southward to Tiananmen \u2014 the Gate of Heavenly Peace \u2014 and the vast square of the same name just beyond. To the east stand the smooth metallic skyscrapers of the city\u2019s business district. To the north, at the top of Beijing\u2019s central axis \u2014 its so-called dragon\u2019s vein \u2014 sit the Bell and Drum Towers, which once acted as the city\u2019s collective timepiece. And stretching all along the western periphery are the calm, tree-lined waters of the manmade lakes, dug by hand for the pleasure of past emperors. It\u2019s this aerial view of \u201cZhongnanhai,\u201d meaning \u201cmiddle and southern seas,\u201d and the surrounding buildings that today\u2019s Chinese leaders prefer you did not see. That\u2019s because the 1,500-acre site of repurposed imperial pavilions and temples, along with gray modern offices has formed the leadership compound for the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP)  since 1950. As the seat of power, Zhongnanhai is often thought of as China\u2019s equivalent to the White House, or the Kremlin. Synonymous with China\u2019s communist party elite, and among the country\u2019s most secretive places, it is ringed by a centuries-old red ochre wall, with countless CCTV cameras periscoping above it \u2014 and patrolled assiduously by security forces in both plain clothes and uniform. A peaceful getaway For Chinese leader Xi Jinping\u2019s imperial forebears, the site served a somewhat different function. While emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties ruled their vast kingdom from within the Forbidden City, they built temples, halls and living quarters in Zhongnanhai; less grandly ceremonial than those of the palace, they were often oriented to take advantage of the views afforded by the area\u2019s tranquil waters and carefully planned gardens. Many of these emperors came to favor passing their days surrounded by drooping willows in the cool and quiet of this cultivated pleasure garden. A story relayed by the scholar Geremie Barm\u00e9 in his book \u201cThe Forbidden City\u201d tells of the 18th-century Qianlong Emperor\u2019s daily routine at Zhongnanhai: Each morning, after a first breakfast of cold swallows nest soup, he would travel by heated palanquin to the gardens\u2019\u00a0Studio of Convivial Delight,\u00a0a pavilion he built to capitalize on the view of the South Lake, where he would breakfast again on a meal of\u00a018 dishes. As the historian and author of \u201cThe Shortest History of China,\u201d Linda Jaivin, told CNN via email: \u201cThere is something outrageous and yet poetic about the incredible coordination and effort required of a team of bearers, cooks and attendants, just so that an emperor could come, catch a view of the magnificent Ocean Terrace, scoff his food and (leave).\u201d The first ruler to view Zhongnanhai as primarily a place to govern from, not simply relax in, was the Empress Dowager Cixi, who effectively controlled China for almost five decades from 1861. She lived for many years in the gardens\u2019 Hall of Ceremonial Phoenixes, which became the center of political authority in China. She would die there in 1908. The serene surroundings of Zhongnanhai also became, under Cixi, a place of punishment and confinement. In 1898, following attempted reforms that displeased her, Cixi imprisoned her nephew, the Guangxu Emperor, on Yingtai Island, which juts out into the southern lake. Built as a miniature version of the mythical Penglai island, home to the immortals of Chinese legend, the tiny piece of land would become the emperor\u2019s home for most of his life, bar a brief period when the Boxer rebellion of 1900 forced the whole court to flee the capital. He would die on Yingtai Island from arsenic poisoning the day before the Empress Dowager herself. His imprisonment and death, said writer M. A. Aldrich, author of \u201cThe Search for a Vanishing Beijing: A Guide to China\u2019s Capital Through the Ages,\u201d perhaps adds a touch of poignancy for any subsequent resident of Zhongnanhai. \u201cIn addition to being a site that preserves sites of imperial splendor,\u201d he told CNN, \u201cit also functions as a reminder to the political elite about the consequences for stepping out of line.\u201d For Aldrich, however, the Zhongnanhai compound also represents the destructive impulses of the CCP towards its adopted capital in the years after 1949, when Mao Zedong proclaimed the foundation of the People\u2019s Republic. \u201cAs a political symbol of the New China, it has been torn up, rebuilt, expanded, and revamped so many times that its connection with its elegant past has been lost,\u201d Aldrich said. Architectural changes There have been serious revisions to the architecture of Zhongnanhai since the end of imperial rule in 1912. After the last emperor abdicated the throne, China\u2019s new president Yuan Shikai granted him the right to live on the northern section of the Forbidden City \u2014 and then took Zhongnanhai to be his new administration\u2019s headquarters. The changes he made to the imperial gardens were disparaged by many of the Westerners who visited them. \u201cWhatever may be one\u2019s opinion as to whether Yuan Shikai \u2018exalted his aim\u2019 in his political career, he certainly cannot be said to have done so as builder and architect,\u201d wrote L.C. Arlington and William Lewisohn in their 1935 book \u201cIn Search of Old Peking,\u201d \u201cfor all the buildings that have been erected or restored by him are in the worst possible taste.\u201d Most notable of these changes \u2014 at least to ordinary Beijingers \u2014 was the repurposing of a two-story pavilion at the very south of the gardens. Known as the Precious Moon Tower, it had been built decades earlier by the Qianlong Emperor for a homesick lover, a Muslim woman from Xinjiang, taken to Beijing as part of the spoils of war. The concubine would gaze south from the tower toward a mock mosque and bazaar the emperor had especially constructed to assuage her longing for home. Yuan refashioned this pavilion into the main entrance to his presidential compound, and established a tall watchtower just to its east. The gate was named Xinhuamen, or the Gate of New China. Today, the structure remains coated in the same deep red that graces the walls of all Beijing\u2019s imperial buildings, with a roof of glazed yellow tiles and detailing that runs below the roofline, picked out in blue and gold. The gate is now flanked by two red banners that speak to its modern purpose as China\u2019s political and party headquarters: \u201cLong Live the Great Communist Party of China\u201d reads one; and \u201cLong Live the Invincible Mao Zedong Thought\u201d on the other. On a screen wall recessed behind the entrance way, Chinese characters written in Mao\u2019s own calligraphic style declare: \u201cServe the People.\u201d Facing out onto Beijing\u2019s main east-west thoroughfare, the gate remains the most conspicuous part of Zhongnanhai. The rest of the compound has, since 1989, been firmly off-limits to the Chinese public. Seat of power Initially, after the communist victory in China\u2019s civil war in 1949, Mao Zedong took up residence at Shuangqing Villa in Fragrant Hills, another former imperial garden to the west of Beijing. Though wary of establishing himself in the imperial heart of Beijing \u2014 it is said that he refused ever to enter the Forbidden City, for fear of being associated with the power structures of old, feudal China he had fought to overthrow \u2014 Mao ultimately moved into Zhongnanhai and, in late 1949, he set up in the\u00a0Garden of Abundant Beneficence,\u00a0a large courtyard compound favored by both the Qianlong and Kangxi emperors, where he would hold court with dignitaries\u00a0and live\u00a0until 1966. Having re-established Zhongnanhai as a center of political power in the new China, Mao set about rebuilding the compound according to his tastes. \u201cSince 1949, an assortment of new architecture styles has encroached into Zhongnanhai, with a tennis court, gymnasium, swimming pools and Western buildings topped off with Chinese eave roofs adding a discordant note that would not have been appreciated by its traditionally-minded original owners,\u201d said Aldrich. In 1966, Mao moved from the Garden of Abundant Beneficence to a specially built house beside his beloved indoor swimming pool. He often summoned officials to speak to him as he bobbed in the water \u2014 and famously received Russian leader Nikita Khrushchev at his pool during a 1958 visit. \u201cTheir interpreters had to pace alongside the edge of the pool,\u201d said Jaivin. \u201cThe Russian couldn\u2019t swim and had to wear water wings. Mao loved both swimming and putting Khrushchev in his place. Finally, Khrushchev got sick of it, and clambered out to sit on the edge, dangling his feet in the water.\u201d In the residence next door, Mao lined his rooms with bookshelves housing an extensive library of Chinese classical literature. \u201cIt was here,\u201d noted Aldrich, \u201cwith the background trappings of a scholar, that he met Nixon and Kissinger in 1972.\u201d Most subsequent leaders have preferred to keep a house outside the Zhongnanhai compound. Deng Xiaoping lived, from 1977, in a courtyard house on a nearby lane adjacent to Beihai, the \u201cNorthern Sea\u201d of central Beijing\u2019s chain of lakes. While not officially disclosed, it is believed that more contemporary leaders, including Xi Jinping and his predecessors Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, have maintained homes in an exclusive gated compound in Jade Spring Hill, sometimes called the \u201cback garden\u201d of Chinese politics, out to the city\u2019s west. Aldrich noted that those leaders and party cadres who used Zhongnanhai as their primary residence often attracted unwelcome scrutiny for their activities, particularly during years of political turbulence. \u201cIn his memoirs, Chairman Mao\u2019s physician, Li Zhisui, commented that (the complex\u2019s) residents were always under surveillance,\u201d Aldrich said. \u201cDuring the Cultural Revolution, the simple act of making a fire would bring down the wrath of the security guards on the perpetrator. It was believed that such a fire was proof that incriminating or seditious materials were being destroyed.\u201d The imperial gardens offering vistas of Zhongnanhai\u2019s lakes have, today, been filled in with dozens of gray offices and meeting halls, many of which date to 1970s, when Zhongnanhai underwent significant razing and renovation \u2014 the rebuilding was so extensive that one visitor in 1979 described the grounds resembling a construction site, with muddy roads that were impossible to walk on. The contemporary compound splits roughly in two, with the northern buildings, on the banks of the \u201cmiddle lake,\u201d used as the headquarters of China\u2019s top executive body, the State Council. It is here that foreign dignitaries are admitted. Around the \u201csouthern lake,\u201d meanwhile, are the headquarters of the CCP, including, within Qinzheng Hall (the Hall of Diligent Government), the offices of the general secretary of the party (a post currently held by Xi). Many of the most historically significant political events to occur at Zhongnanhai have taken place in Huairen Hall, or the Hall of Cherished Compassion, on the western side of the Middle Lake. The hall was added to the imperial park during the late Qing dynasty, but was then extensively remodeled by the CCP in the early 1950s to impart a more august socialist grandeur. It is a broad, imposing ceremonial hall with staggered roofs of glazed green tiles falling in curved lines to upturned corners; the facade of austere grey brick is interrupted by red wooden pillars, windows and doors. The building\u2019s capacious interior houses a large auditorium, as well as numerous smaller meeting rooms. The hall has, for decades, served as the main meeting place for China\u2019s Politburo, the party\u2019s decision-making body usually comprising about two dozen members. On occasion, it has also hosted the Politburo\u2019s Standing Committee, the core of China\u2019s political elite, (the power of both bodies has notably dwindled in the era of Xi), though they most commonly meet in Qinzheng Hall, close to the general secretary\u2019s office. During the tumult of the Cultural Revolution vital discussions and debates occurred at Huairen Hall, and, in the months after its conclusion, it was there that three of the so-called Gang of Four \u2014 the political faction that included Mao\u2019s wife held responsible for the worst excesses of the era \u2014 were arrested, tricked into attending a meeting they thought was about the publication of the fifth volume of Mao\u2019s Selected Works. In April 1989, former party head Hu Yaobang suffered a heart-attack during a Politburo meeting at Huairen; his death a week later would trigger the Tiananmen Square protests that the government forcibly cracked down on in early June of that year. However, the compound hasn\u2019t always been so forbidden for the masses following the collapse of China\u2019s imperial dynasty. In the late 1920s, it became a park, with tourists allowed to boat on and swim in the lakes, while in the 1980s, the public could access some of its scenic and historical spots, including\u00a0Mao\u2019s\u00a0former residence, on\u00a0organized weekend tours.\u00a0Even early in 1989, a journalist for the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0was able to casually\u00a0drive\u00a0a senior official into the compound and drop him off inside.\u00a0During a period of warmer US and China relations in 2011, former Chinese president\u00a0Hu Jintao\u00a0invited\u00a0a group of American high school students to Zhongnanhai. Modern security concerns Today, Zhongnanhai is more closely-guarded than ever, though the inexorable development of the city has caused problems in maintaining the compound\u2019s secrecy. When an annex to the nearby Beijing Hotel was built in\u00a01973, authorities were panicked by the realization that from its upper floors one could quite easily see \u2013 and potentially target a sniper rifle \u2013 into Zhongnanhai. A building was hastily erected on the western edge of the Forbidden City to restrict this view. Likewise in 2018, when Beijing\u2019s new tallest building was\u00a0completed\u00a0\u2013 the 528-meter Citic tower, better known as the \u201cZun\u201d \u2013 the country\u2019s national security apparatus reportedly requisitioned the top floors amid fears that visitors or occupants might be able to spy into the compound. Beijing authorities did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on the security situation at the time. Zhongnanhai\u2019s entrance, Xinhuamen, has also been the site of repeated demonstrations in recent decades; in 1989, it was a gathering point for students taking part in the Tiananmen protests, whilst in 1999, more than 10,000 members of the since-banned Falun Gong gathered on the sidewalks near Zhongnanhai to protest their treatment at the hands of the government. So, while Zhongnanhai is sometimes compared to the White House, Aldrich argues that the paranoia with which the compound is today guarded makes it more like the imperial palace of centuries past: \u201cSince ordinary people are not allowed to enter Zhongnanhai, it is probably more appropriate to describe it as a \u2018New Forbidden City\u2019 for China\u2019s ruling elite rather than a place with a personal political resonance for the average citizen,\u201d he said. \u201cHeck, even the Kremlin is open to tourists!\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/style/zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "world"}}

The 22-year-old was helped off the court during the Sparks\u2019 79-70 loss against Connecticut on Tuesday, casting doubt on her participation in the Olympic Games later this year. \u201cYou never think it will happen to you. And despite all the hard work sometimes it does,\u201d Brink said in an Instagram post on Wednesday. \u201cThis is hard to fathom but I know it will only make me stronger. I will not be derailed and I will continue to love this life. I\u2019m not defined by basketball, but it is something that I love deeply and I will work everyday to get back to it. \u201cIt\u2019s not goodbye basketball it\u2019s just a see you later. I\u2019m always so thankful for your thoughts and prayers.\u201d In its post on social media Wednesday, the Sparks did not confirm a timeline for Brink\u2019s recovery and Team USA is yet to comment. However, such an injury would usually rule Brink out of this year\u2019s Olympics which are set to start on July 26. The WNBA No. 2 overall pick appeared to lose her footing while driving to the basket against Connecticut\u2019s Brionna Jones less than four minutes into the game and was shown on the broadcast clutching her knee immediately after the play. Brink limped off the court before being carried to the locker room by Sparks staff. The team later announced that she had been ruled out for the remainder of the game. \u201cExcept for the 2019 season, I\u2019ve lost a starter to injury every single year I\u2019ve been a head coach in this league,\u201d LA head coach Curt Miller said postgame on Tuesday. \u201cYou just have to have the mentality of next person up and rally around it. \u201cSo we\u2019re praying and hoping for the best for Cam.\u201d The Sparks went on to lose the game, their 10th straight defeat against the Sun in a streak that dates back to 2020. All five Connecticut starters scored in double figures to move the team to a league-best 13-1 record. DeWanna Bonner led her squad in an all-around performance, recording 16 points, seven rebounds, two steals and two blocks.

The 3x3 basketball event is being featured in just its second Olympic games, with the US winning the inaugural women\u2019s gold medal in Tokyo in 2021.

{"id": "2024_06_19_asia_taiwan-us-drones-sale-intl-hnk-ml", "text": "The United States has approved the $360 million sale of more than 1,000 small armed drones to Taiwan, as the self-ruled island claimed by China aims to strengthen its asymmetrical warfare abilities with an eye on successful tactics used on the battlefield in Ukraine. Taiwan will receive 720 Switchblade missiles and accompanying fire control systems worth $60.2 million, according to a release from the US Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) on Tuesday. The US will also provide Taiwan with up to\u00a0291 Altius 600M loitering munitions and supporting components with a price tag of $300 million, the DSCA said. The proposed sale comes as China increases military pressure on Taiwan, with extensive military exercises around it and almost daily warplane flights near the island. China\u2019s ruling Communist Party claims democratic Taiwan as its own, despite never having controlled it, and has vowed to \u201creunify\u201d with the island, by force if necessary. Under the Taiwan Relations Act, Washington is legally required to provide the island with the means to defend itself, and it supplies Taipei with defensive weaponry. But the arms sales have drawn angry rebukes from Beijing. In a speech at the Shangri-La Dialogue defense summit in Singapore earlier this month, Chinese Defense Minister Adm. Dong Jun slammed \u201cexternal interfering forces\u201d for selling arms and having \u201cillegal official contacts\u201d with Taiwan, in an apparent reference to the US. The Switchblade, which looks like a small fixed-wing drone, is an inexpensive lightweight precision-guided missile that can be launched from a variety of platforms within two minutes, stay aloft for 20 minutes and with a range of 30 kilometers (18.6 miles). Manufacturer AeroVironment says it has performed well\u00a0in Ukraine\u2019s defense of Russia\u2019s ongoing invasion. \u201cWe have been gratified by overwhelming user feedback and demand for additional systems,\u201d company CEO Wahid Nawabi said in an April post on AeroVironment\u2019s website. Meanwhile, the larger Altius 600M can carry \u201cmultiple seeker and warhead options\u201d while being launched from\u00a0land, air and sea platforms, manufacturer Anduril says on its website. Both drones can also be used for reconnaissance. In a statement Wednesday, Taiwan\u2019s presidential office thanked the US for its security commitments, adding this was the Biden administration\u2019s 15th weapons sale to the island since 2021. \u201cTaiwan will continue to strengthen our self-defense and asymmetric warfare capabilities to enhance our deterrence,\u201d presidential office spokeswoman Karen Kuo said. \u201cWe will firmly defend our constitutional system of democracy and freedom, and we will work with countries with similar ideals to safeguard the rules-based international order.\u201d The two systems will join a long backlog of weapons and munitions approved for Taiwan that have yet to be delivered. A June 3 accounting of US military sales to Taiwan shows more than $19.6 billion in weapons and ammo approved but yet to be delivered to the island\u2019s military, according to the Washington-based Cato Institute think tank. That includes $6.1 billion in asymmetrical weapon systems, including Harpoon missiles, PAC-3 missile interceptors and MQ-9B aerial drones, Cato said. Many analysts have urged Taiwan to pursue more asymmetrical weapons, which they say would be harder for China to counter than conventional arms in any invasion of the island. \u201cHowever, Taiwan\u2019s military has resisted fully embracing an asymmetric defense posture, and 55 percent of the backlog\u2019s dollar value is for capabilities that are both more expensive and less likely to survive long in a conflict with China,\u201d the Cato brief said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/asia/taiwan-us-drones-sale-intl-hnk-ml/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_06_14_americas_brazil-pantanal-wetland-fires-intl-latam", "text": "Brazil\u2019s Pantanal, the largest tropical wetland on earth, is ablaze, with fires in June breaking historical records for that month. While aerial views of the wetland show smoke rising and the bright orange of burning fires, a closer look at burnt vegetation found charred skeletons of wildlife, including an alligator, monkey and snake, photos from Reuters showed earlier this week. Brazil\u2019s National Institute of Space Research (INPE) has detected 733 fires in the Pantanal biome so far this month, with the previous record for fires in Pantanal for June being 435 registered in 2005. The state of Mato Grosso do Sul, which encompasses 60% of the Brazilian Pantanal, is under a \u201cdanger\u201d warning for a heat wave expected to hit with temperatures 5\u00baC higher than average for the next three to five days, according to Brazil\u2019s National Meteorological Institute (INMET). The World Wildlife Foundation (WWF) Brazil has warned that the entire year of 2024 could become the worst year on record for the Pantanal as the dry season is just beginning, and the number of fires this year already represents an increase of 898% compared to the same period in 2023, according to INPE\u2019s data. \u201cIt is necessary to act quickly reinforcing [fire] brigades and counting with the support of the local communities to avoid a catastrophe\u201d, said Cynthia Santos, conservation analyst for WWF Brazil, in a statement. What to know about the wetlands The Pantanal\u2019s distinctive habitats rely on what scientists call the \u201cflood pulse.\u201d During the wet season between November and March, three quarters of the plain gets flooded, only for much of the water to drain away during the dry months, from April to September. This seasonal flooding makes the Pantanal a unique biome where large swaths of land regularly turn from terrestrial into aquatic habitats and back again. Wetlands like the Pantanal are Earth\u2019s most effective carbon sinks \u2013 ecosystems that absorb and store more carbon than they release, keeping it away from the atmosphere. At roughly 200,000 square kilometers, the Pantanal comprises about 3% of the globe\u2019s wetlands and plays a key role in the carbon cycle. When these carbon-rich ecosystems burn, vast amounts of heat-trapping gases are released back into the atmosphere, contributing to the greenhouse effect. According to the World Wide Fund for Nature (known as the World Wildlife Fund in the US and Canada), the Pantanal boasts the greatest concentration of wildlife in South America \u2013 higher than that of its more famous northern neighbor, the Amazon. \u201cThe Pantanal is very important for the planet, it has unique wild areas that are fundamental to life on Earth,\u201d said Andre Luiz Siqueira, the CEO of ECOA, an environmental NGO based in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso do Sul, speaking to CNN in 2020. The area is home to thousands of endangered or unusual species, including jaguars, capybaras, black caimans, giant otters and hyacinth macaws. It\u2019s also an important stop on the routes of around 180 species of migratory birds. The wetland is facing a \u201chydrological crisis scenario\u201d due to an intense drought. The lack of rain began in 2023 and has been aggravated by the ongoing El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon, according to ECOA. Occasional wildfires are normal in the Pantanal, so much so that some plants in the region developed resistance to fires \u2013 for example by growing thick bark or covering their seeds with hard shells. In 2020, the fires destroyed unique habitats and wrecked the livelihoods of many of the Pantanal\u2019s diverse indigenous communities.

The Kanchenjunga Express, which runs between\u00a0the city of Kolkata and Silchar in northeastern Assam state, was struck by a freight train south of the city of Siliguri, according to West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. Disaster teams have rushed to the crash location, which lies below the foothills that lead to Darjeeling, a popular mountain tourist destination famous for its tea plantations and stunning Himalayan views. Local media pictures and video footage\u00a0from the scene showed at least one train car on its side, parts of it crushed into a mass of twisted metal. Another car can be seen rising into the air at a steep angle above an engine carriage. \u201cEight people were brought dead to the hospital and one patient who was in a very serious condition succumbed to his injuries overnight,\u201d Sanjay Mallick, the medical superintendent of the North Bengal Medical College and Hospital, told CNN.

Live images from the site of the crash streamed live by local news channel TV 9 showed people gathered outside the carriages, some filming on their phones. The crash comes more than a year after India experienced one of the worst train disasters in the country\u2019s history, when more than 280 people were killed in a three-way collision involving two passenger trains and a freight train in eastern Odisha state. That incident shocked the nation, renewing calls for authorities to confront safety issues in a railway system that transports more than 13 million passengers every day. India\u2019s extensive rail network, one of the largest in the world, was built more than 160 years ago under British colonial rule. Today, it runs about 11,000 trains every day over 67,000 miles of tracks in the world\u2019s\u00a0most populous nation. But decaying infrastructure is often cited as a cause for traffic delays and numerous train accidents. Though\u00a0government statistics show that accidents and derailments have been on the decline in recent years, they are still tragically common. More than 16,000 people were killed in nearly 18,000 railway accidents across the country in 2021, according to the National Crime Records Bureau. Most railway accidents were due to falls from trains and collisions between trains and people on the track. Train-on-train collisions are less common. On Monday, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the West Bengal crash \u201csaddening\u201d and sent a message of condolence to the affected families. \u201cI pray that the injured recover at the earliest.

Thursday\u2019s game will now serve as a national remembrance \u201cof an American who will forever remain on the short list of the most impactful individuals our great game has ever known,\u201d MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred. MLB at Rickwood Field: A Tribute to the Negro Leagues on Fox will include a pregame ceremony honoring Mays, who began his pro career with the Black Barons in 1948. The Say Hey Kid, as he was called for the way he enthusiastically greeted others, died \u201cpeacefully and among loved ones,\u201d his son, Michael Mays, said in a statement from the Giants, the MLB franchise with which Mays was most associated. \u201cI want to thank you all from the bottom of my broken heart for the unwavering love you have shown him over the years. You have been his life\u2019s blood,\u201d Michael Mays said. Rickwood Field is hallowed ground. It was the site of the final Negro League World Series game in October 1948. Mays and his Black Barons fell to the Homestead Grays in five games. Built in 1910, Rickwood Field is the oldest baseball stadium in America. \u201cThat was the place that a 17-year-old kid named Willie Mays came out and patrolled center field for the Birmingham Black Barons,\u201d said Bob Kendricks, president of the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum in Kansas City, Missouri. \u201cIt is always meaningful. It gave me goosebumps. And it still does every time I walk out on that field. \u201cWhile we\u2019re all in somewhat of a somber mood, it will be, I believe, the ultimate celebration of Willie Mays\u2019 life.\u201d Standing near Rickwood Field on Wednesday, Greg Morla, who is visiting Birmingham from San Francisco with his wife for Thursday\u2019s game, recalled his father taking him to his first MLB game in 1970 at the old Candlestick Park in San Francisco. Morla didn\u2019t know the hometown Giants but he was impressed by the ovation for one player in particular. \u201cDad, who\u2019s that?\u201d Morla, wearing a Giants jersey, said he asked his father. \u201cMy dad educated me who Willie was. That\u2019s how I became a fan of the Giants. That\u2019s how I became a big fan of Willie \u2026 And when he passed last night, I had tears coming down. May he rest in peace. He\u2019s my idol forever.\u201d Mays hit for both power and for average while also shinning at\u00a0running, throwing and fielding. In 23 major league seasons, mostly with the New York Giants and the San Francisco Giants, he closed out his career with\u00a0660 career home runs\u00a0\u2013 then the second most behind legend Babe Ruth. Mays would play in 24 All-Star games before retiring in 1973 after two seasons with the New York Mets. His number 24 is retired by the San Francisco Giants. In early June, after\u00a0Major League Baseball integrated Negro League statistics into its record books\u00a0and added 10 hits to Mays\u2019 career totals,\u00a0he told CNN\u00a0that \u201cit must be some kind of record for a 93-year-old.\u201d The hits came in 1948, when he was a teenager with the Negro American League\u2019s Black Barons. \u201cI was still in high school,\u201d Mays recalled. \u201cOur school did not have a baseball team. I played football and basketball, but I loved baseball. So my dad let me to play \u2026 but ONLY if I stayed in school. He wanted me to graduate. I played with the team on weekends until school was out for the summer.\u201d \u201cI thought that was IT; that was the top of the world. Man, I was so proud to play with those guys,\u201d he said. Mays called his statistical accomplishment at age 93 \u201camazing.\u201d Mays led the National League in home runs and steals in four seasons and in slugging five times. He hit over .300 10 times and had a career average of .301. He was an ambassador to the game and a father figure to countless younger players who would become stars in their own right. \u201cThroughout all that time in New York, he was the guy that everybody looked out for. The Giants moved west in 1958. Suddenly, he became the guy that looked out for everybody else, and I\u2019m talking Willie McCovey, Orlando Cepeda, Juan Marichal, the Alou brothers,\u201d San Francisco Chronicle baseball writer and Mays biographer John Shea recalled. \u201cHe was the guy in the clubhouse. He was the guy on the team. So, all that wisdom he got from the Negro Leagues and the Black Barons and his father playing catch as a young boy was all put together. \u201cAnd throughout his life, he wanted to pay it back and he spent the last many, many decades doing just that. And look at it now. It\u2019s like he\u2019s going out on his terms. It\u2019s a full circle moment. We\u2019re all in Birmingham to celebrate the Negro Leagues, to celebrate Willie Mays. And two days before the Rickwood game, he said, \u2018Thank you.\u2019 \u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/sport/say-hey-kid-willie-mays-baseball/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "world"}}

Gershkovich, 32, has been imprisoned since he was arrested while on a reporting trip in March last year by the FSB, Russia\u2019s federal security service, which accused him of trying to obtain state secrets. Gershkovich, the US government and his employer, the Wall Street Journal, have vehemently denied the charges against him. The Russian Prosecutor General\u2019s office said last Thursday it had approved the indictment and referred Gershkovich\u2019s case to a trial court. If convicted, he faces up to 20 years in prison. The case will be heard in the Sverdlovsk Regional Court, TASS reported Monday. A US State Department spokesperson said Monday the US was concerned about reports the trial would be held behind closed doors, but said members of the US Embassy in Russia would try to go to it anyway. \u201cWe will try to attend the trial, as we try to attend the trial of any American citizens who are detained in Russia, but ultimately I don\u2019t have an answer for you yet whether that\u2019s going to be possible,\u201d said the spokesperson Matthew Miller told a press briefing. Miller said the US would continue to try to free Gershkovich as well as fellow wrongfully detained US citizen and former Marine Paul Whelan. For more than a year since his arrest,\u00a0Gershkovich\u00a0has been imprisoned in Moscow\u2019s notorious Lefortovo Prison, and his pre-trial detention period had been extended numerous times. The trial venue of Yekaterinburg is more than 1,100 miles east of the capital. Miller said he did not know if Gershkovich had yet been moved from Lefortovo to Yekaterinburg. Last week, Russian prosecutors said the FSB had \u201cestablished and documented\u201d that Gershkovich was acting on CIA instructions in the month he was arrested, alleging he had \u201ccollected secret information\u201d about a Russian tank factory. \u201cGershkovich carried out the illegal actions using painstaking conspiratorial methods,\u201d it said in a statement. Gershkovich\u2019s detention has been a source of tension between Washington and Moscow, whose relations were already deeply strained due to Russia\u2019s ongoing invasion of Ukraine. The White House has previously alleged the Kremlin is using Gershkovich, the first American reporter detained in Russia on allegations of spying since the Cold War, as a geopolitical hostage. On Thursday, the State Department\u2019s Miller\u00a0said the allegations against Gershkovich have \u201cabsolutely zero credibility.\u201d \u201cWe have been clear from the start that Evan has done nothing wrong. He should never have been arrested in the first place. Journalism is not a crime. The charges against him are false, and the Russian government knows that they\u2019re false. He should be released immediately,\u201d Miller said at a State Department briefing. The US has repeatedly warned American citizens not to travel to Russia.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/europe/russia-evan-gershkovich-closed-door-trial-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "travel_matera-italy-parkour-visitors-damage", "text": "Jumping from building to building in an ancient city might seem like a dream for those who practice parkour \u2014 a sport that involves making it past obstacles \u2014 but it can cause damage to historic buildings. A London-based parkour group, Team Phat, visited the ancient Italian city of\u00a0Matera, running, climbing and leaping through its streets and over its\u00a0precious structures. One of the freerunners caused a segment of a historic building to fall off, sending both himself and the building part crashing to the ground. Matera, a city of stone which dates back to the Paleolithic era, is located in the Basilicata region in Southern Italy. In 1993, it was granted UNESCO World Heritage status and was the European Capital of Culture in 2019. A\u00a0video\u00a0of parkour stunts in the ancient city was posted by Team Phat on YouTube two months ago, along with a caption explaining that they were \u201cin the beautiful city of\u00a0Matera\u201d where one of their members, Devon McIntosh, \u201chad a scary fall that could have been really bad.\u201d The video shows the freerunner jumping off a building and attempting to use a stone ledge to help him get to another building across the street. But the ledge could not withstand his force and dramatically broke off. An off-camera member of the team suggests that they \u201chide the evidence\u201d and McIntosh shows his injury to his leg. The video has attracted many critical comments on social media. \u201cThis city is a UNESCO heritage site for a reason,\u201d wrote an Instagram user named Bruno Burke. \u201cWe should enjoy our [parkour] discipline as much as possible, but we should also watch where we step, not only for safety but also for respect of culture and history.\u201d Misbehaving visitors Many of\u00a0Matera\u2019s districts and habitable caves were renovated in the second half of the 20th century, as the city regained its charm and became a popular Instagrammable hotspot. Unsurprisingly, international cinema also pays the occasional visit. The 2021 James Bond movie, \u201cNo time to\u00a0Die\u201d features an exciting car chase through\u00a0Matera\u2019s streets. The well curated remains of the ancient cave churches, fortified farmhouses and districts make\u00a0Matera\u00a0a city of universal value, according to UNESCO. CNN has reached out to Matera\u2019s police force for comment on the parkour incident. Team Phat\u2019s behavior has raised further questions about the conduct of travelers at sites of architectural beauty. At the start of the video, one of the Team Phat members said: \u201cAs some of you know, we\u2019ve been banned from Venice and we can never go back.\u201d In March 2023, a Team Phat member\u00a0jumped into a canal in Venice, following which Mayor Luigi Brugnaro commented on X:\u00a0\u201cThis \u2018subject\u2019 should be given a certificate of STUPIDITY\u2026.

{"id": "2024_06_17_asia_pig-butchering-scam-southeast-asia-dst-intl-hnk", "text": "Sitting at the kitchen table, Matt struggles to recount the events of the past few months. \u201cAs soon as I found out that it was a suicide, I was 100% sure that it was the scam,\u201d he says. \u201cOur father was, from the day I was born until six months ago, always a positive, happy person. This was literally the only thing in his life that had happened, to where it changed him, and it just crushed him.\u201d On a horse farm in northern Virginia, surrounded by sprawling fields and stables, the family gathers at their younger sister Adrianne\u2019s house - something they\u2019ve done a lot in the three months since their father took his own life after falling victim to a so-called \u201cpig butchering\u201d scam. The scams \u2013 mostly run out of Southeast Asia - are given that name because they involve \u201cfattening up\u201d victims before taking everything they have. The con artists behind them take on false online identities and spend months financially grooming their victims to get them to invest on fraudulent cryptocurrency websites. Dennis Jones, an avid runner and photographer, was adored by his children and grandchildren. Described as \u201ca bit of an activist\u201d by his family, the 82-year-old spent much of his retirement working with refugees and debating politics online. But in the last few months of his life he withdrew from his family and, having been divorced for years, befriended a woman going by the name Jessie on Facebook. The two had been talking online for months and built a close relationship. Eventually, Jessie convinced Dennis to invest in crypto. Dennis complied. Without ever meeting Jessie in person, he spent everything he had, and when he had nothing left, she demanded more. Until one day the money disappeared, leaving him in ruin. In early March, Dennis\u2019 children scheduled a meeting to help their father get back on his feet after the scam. The plan was for him to move in with Adrianne and her family. \u201cWe wanted him to know that he was going to be taken care of,\u201d Matt said. But the morning of the meeting none of them could reach Dennis. Matt drove to Dennis\u2019s apartment but he wasn\u2019t home, and all calls went straight to voicemail. They figured he must be out on one of his long runs. An hour later, police knocked on Matt\u2019s door to inform him that Dennis had taken his own life. Dennis was one of countless victims of a massive global criminal operation predominantly run by Chinese gangs who have built a multibillion-dollar scam industry in Southeast Asia. There, they\u2019ve assembled an army of scammers, many held against their will in guarded compounds and forced to con people all around the world out of their life savings. It\u2019s theft at a scale so large that investigators are now calling it a mass transfer of wealth from middle-class Americans to criminal gangs. Last year, the FBI estimates, pig butchering scams stole nearly $4 billion from tens of thousands of American victims, a 53% increase from the year before. While the crime takes place online, its real-world consequences are devastating. Law enforcement sources predict that losses will continue to grow in the next year, and as the criminals remain out of reach, money and lives will continue to be lost. \u2018Victims victimizing victims\u2019 Santa Clara county prosecutor Erin West has dedicated the last few years to fighting pig butchering scams. \u201cI\u2019ve been a prosecutor for over 25 years, I\u2019ve done all kinds of different types of crime. I spent nine years in sexual assault. And I\u2019ve never seen the absolute decimation of people that I\u2019ve seen as a result of pig butchering,\u201d she says. Being in the heart of the tech industry in California\u2019s Bay Area, Erin and her team were some of the first to begin investigating pig butchering scams. \u201cWe\u2019ve got victims victimizing victims and the only winners are Chinese gangsters,\u201d she says. Shawn Bradstreet, US Secret Service special agent in charge of the San Francisco field office, told CNN that some of the money stolen from American victims is spent on expanding the scam operations and the massive compounds that house them and other illicit activities. West and Bradstreet are part of a small group of US law enforcement agencies working to find ways to tackle a crime that largely takes place online and overseas. Social media is flooded with scammers hunting for victims, on WhatsApp, Facebook, LinkedIn and, increasingly, dating apps such as Bumble and Tinder. \u201cThe unfortunate reality is that scammers may pull on the heartstrings on those looking for love or connection - on dating apps and on all online platforms,\u201d a spokesman for Match group, which owns Tinder, said in a statement. Match, Bumble, Facebook and Whatsapp parent company Meta told CNN they are working to prevent scammers from using their platforms, by flagging suspicious language and educating their users. In a statement to CNN a Bumble spokesperson said they have introduced AI to help identify spam, scam and fake profiles \u201caiming to take action before such profiles have the opportunity to interact with members.\u201d CNN has reached out to LinkedIn for comment. In May, a group of tech companies including cryptocurrency exchange platform Coinbase, Meta, Match group and the anti-scam charity organization GASO announced the \u201cTech Against Scams Coalition,\u201d acknowledging that scams \u201care a pervasive issue across the entire tech landscape.\u201d But West says that\u2019s not enough. She recently set up a task force called Operation Shamrock to bring together law enforcement, social media, crypto exchanges and traditional banks to tackle crypto scams. A 2023 CNN investigation revealed that many of the scammers are themselves victims of human trafficking. Lured to Southeast Asia with promises of white-collar jobs, they are instead trafficked into Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos and other destinations. Since a 2021 military coup, Myanmar has become Asia\u2019s scam capital where criminals can operate freely under the cover of a bloody civil war. Today, city-sized compounds loom over the Myanmar side of the border with Thailand, with nothing but a dried-out river separating the two countries. Inside are what can only be described as scam factories \u2014 offices full of hundreds of slaves, working 16-hour days to befriend victims and convince them to invest in cryptocurrency on fake platforms that mimic legitimate crypto exchanges. Those kept inside tell stories of torture and abuse, of scammers who don\u2019t bring in enough money being beaten with electrical sticks and forced to do hundreds of squats as punishment. Rakesh, an Indian national, was trafficked to a compound called Gate 25 in Myanmar after applying for an IT job in Thailand in late 2022. There he signed a scamming contract under threat of execution, and was trained to scam. For 11 months he posed as \u201cKlara Semonov,\u201d a Russian investor based in Salt Lake City. To avoid gruesome punishments inflicted by his captors, he said he sent romantic messages to victims like Dennis to convince them to invest their money. \u201cSeventy to 80% fall for fake love,\u201d he said. Rakesh was eventually released in 2023 when his contract ended. He believes he was let go because he simply wasn\u2019t good enough at scamming. \u201cThey (were) treating us like slaves,\u201d he told CNN days after his release in 2023. Conveniently located on the border, the compounds use telecoms services from the Thai side. In November 2023 Thai Justice Minister Tawee Sodsong said they were working to cut off the compounds. Pachara Naripthaphan of the Thai National Broadcasting Transmissions Commission has since told CNN that in May they instructed all telecom operators to shut off wireless services in proximity to any areas bordering Myanmar, Laos or Cambodia. Despite that, their data shows that illicit activity has continued at a baseline level as criminals adjust to using other means of connecting to the internet such as Starlink. Even here on the border, where the physical distance is reduced to nothing but a narrow river, the criminals remain out of the reach of law enforcement, either locally or internationally. \u201cMany of these perpetrators are beyond my reach. And in order to establish deterrence, we need to prosecute some individuals who are running these operations in Southeast Asia,\u201d Santa Clara district attorney Jeff Rosen says. According to FBI data, out of nearly $5 billion dollars lost to cryptocurrency fraud in 2023, $3.96 billion was stolen in pig butchering scams. While Rosen\u2019s office and the Secret Service have had some success in retrieving millions of dollars in stolen funds, no American law enforcement agency has been able to arrest a single suspected scammer. \u2018Hard to believe\u2019 Carina, who asked CNN to only use her first name, met \u201cEvan\u201d on Bumble in May 2023. His photos showed a blond man with piercing blue eyes. He claimed to be Dutch and showed off his wealth \u2014 expensive cars and Rolexes, though none of that appealed to Carina, a chemistry PhD and triathlete. Their relationship moved fast. Right away he suggested they move their conversation to WhatsApp and delete the Bumble app to focus on getting to know each other. A few days later he started calling her \u201choney.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re doing that already?\u201d Carina asked, in a text conversation seen by CNN. Evan claimed he had made his money running a company with his uncle and investing in crypto. He told her she could pay off her student loans in a matter of months by investing. Carina was hesitant at first but eventually agreed to put in $1,000. He told her not to use the official app of the Kraken crypto platform, and instead sent her a link to a parallel website which they used to trade in the coming months. As their investments grew, so did their relationship. The two made plans for the future, romantic weekend getaways and family introductions, though they were yet to meet in person. \u201cI\u2019ve never met anyone like you before. Hard to believe I\u2019m falling for a man I have never seen or spoken to,\u201d Carina told him just a few weeks in. The first red flag emerged when Evan pressured Carina to enter an \u201cevent\u201d where she would have to invest $150,000 by the end of July to make extra profit. If she failed to reach the target, her account and money would be frozen. Scared to lose the money she had already put in, Carina panicked. She took out a high-interest loan and borrowed money from friends and family to meet the deadline. Despite all his purported wealth, Evan refused to help her, instead lying and telling her he was struggling to meet his target of $500,000 and needed her help, she said. At one point, Carina found herself consoling her scammer, telling him the money didn\u2019t matter as long as they loved each other. \u2018Major psychological stunt\u2019 After Dennis took his life, his adult children were left piecing together what happened by going through his Facebook messages. There, they learned for the first time what Dennis had been dealing with. \u201cI have been having dark thoughts about my life and it being over. Certainly it looks like my financial life is done,\u201d Dennis messaged his scammer in the months before his death. \u201cAnd the ultimate pain here is that I have betrayed family trust. This is unbearable,\u201d he writes in screenshots of their conversation seen by CNN. \u201cWhat\u2019s most heartbreaking is reading through these messages. He was talking about having signs of a nervous breakdown. And so these were all shared with the profile,\u201d Adrianne says. \u201cInstead of sharing with us,\u201d Matt adds. \u201cWhat\u2019s amazing here is that these scammers overseas have figured out a way that they can get victims to trust them over their own families,\u201d West says. \u201cIt\u2019s a major psychological stunt that they\u2019re pulling on the rest of the world.\u201d Carina didn\u2019t tell her family about what had happened and the stress she was under until the very final moment. After hitting their event targets, Carina tried to withdraw some of her money, but was unable to do so, having violated platform rules by investing in the same account as Evan. After months of hiding it, Carina told her family, who suggested she speak to Kraken directly. The next morning she called Kraken customer services, who informed her there was no account under her name.  \u201cI realized I had been scammed at that point. And I broke down,\u201d Carina says. \u201cIt was all fake. It was a fake profile. It was a fake story. The amount of time that he spent grooming and getting to know me was incessant.\u201d Reading through their conversations a year later, Carina barely recognizes herself. \u201cIt\u2019s actually heartbreaking for me to see the state that I was in,\u201d she says. The emotional and financial entanglement had taken a toll on her, and she was left reeling from a breakup and bankruptcy at the same time.

It was a glimmer of familial normality in Gaza for a nine-year-old and her younger sibling that ended in tragedy. \u201cI didn\u2019t hear its whizzing or anything, I only saw a red light when the missile fell,\u201d Hanan recalls from her hospital bed in Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in central Gaza. Her voice is hoarse and cracked, following reconstructive surgery to her face. She has 20% burns to her face, hands, chest, and leg. Her sister, five-year-old Leene, who was walking ahead of her, escaped injury. \u201cThere was a man next to me dismembered and bleeding and a block of building cement fell on me,\u201d Hanan says. Hanan is one of thousands of critically ill patients waiting for medical evacuation from Gaza but unable to leave following the closure of the Rafah crossing to Egypt in early May. After the airstrike, her father rushed her to hospital, where she also had surgery to remove shrapnel from her face. Her doctor, Mahmoud Mahane, specializes in burns and eye injuries, but says there is nothing more they can do for her inside Gaza. \u201cMost children need medical transfers,\u201d he says, \u201cfor a more qualified treatment than here, as we don\u2019t have the treatment or tools and we don\u2019t have the supplies, we lack these supplies.\u201d Eight months of war have decimated the Gazan health system. Tens of thousands of injured Palestinians and a severe lack of medicine, doctors, and electricity, have proved a lethal combination. The only hope for many is to be evacuated through the Rafah crossing into Egypt and get treatment in neighboring countries. That lifeline has been cut off since May 7 when the Israeli military took\u00a0control of the crossing and closed it. Egypt says it will not open the crossing until the Israeli military withdraws. It cites security reasons \u2013 one Egyptian soldier was killed last month in fighting along the border. Israel says it will not hand over control of the crossing to Palestinian authorities, fearing Hamas would use the area to smuggle in weapons. 10,000 need evacuating Rik Peeperkorn is the World Health Organization\u2019s representative for the West Bank and Gaza. He says there are at least 10,000 urgent cases that need to be evacuated from Gaza for treatment, adding this is likely an under-estimate given the difficulty getting accurate data. \u201cThe biggest group is the war injuries and war-related \u2026 the severe trauma, spinal injury, etc. The other biggest group is, of course, chronic conditions \u2013 oncology, cardiovascular, respiratory as well.\u201d Before the war, Peeperkorn says between 50 and 100 patients would leave daily to be treated in Jerusalem and the West Bank.\u00a0Since May 7, not one single case has been able to leave through Rafah, creating a backlog of desperation and severe cases. \u201cThe Rafah crossing should be reopened as quickly as possible,\u201d Peeperkorn says, \u201cor there should be an alternative crossing or mechanism actually applied because we cannot leave these critical patients. We have no estimation at the moment how many of the patients which should have left actually have already passed away. Before the crossing was closed on May 7, various countries \u2013 including Qatar, Jordan, Egypt, the UAE, Turkey, and parts of the European Union \u2013 had taken in critically ill cases. Some patients also continued to be transferred for treatment in Israeli hospitals after the war began, according to COGAT, Israel\u2019s body overseeing the Palestinian Territories. Peeperkorn says many have said they are ready to welcome more. But with the crossing shut, and Israel and Egypt continuing to blame each other for its continued closure, time is running out for some. In the pediatric department of Nasser Medical Complex in southern Gaza, the sounds of the ICU are overwhelming; a constant cacophony of beeping machines keeping newborn patients alive.

Her doctor says Malak has a heart defect and needs a complex operation considered beyond the capabilities of his hospital with its lack of fuel for generators and medicine. \u201cThe doctors did what was necessary,\u201d al-Sharqi says, \u201cbut they said that she must be transferred (out of Gaza) quickly.\u201d With tears running down her face she adds, \u201cOne of the doctors told me not to have high hopes.

{"id": "2024_06_17_australia_australia-china-cheng-lei-blocked-intl-hnk", "text": "Chinese Premier Li Qiang\u2019s four-day visit to Australia this week was set to be focused on repairing long-strained relations between the two countries. But apparent efforts by Chinese officials to stand in front of an Australian reporter during a press briefing have shone a spotlight back on frictions between the countries. Cheng Lei, a TV anchor who was held in detention in China for more than three years before her release in 2023, told Sky News Australia the officials went to \u201cgreat lengths\u201d to block her from the cameras during a press event Monday where Li and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese signed cooperative agreements. Video footage appears to show two people involved in the incident, with one of them, described by the outlet as a Chinese embassy employee,\u00a0trying at one point to push closer to a seated Cheng, despite being blocked by another woman, identified by Sky News as an Australian official,\u00a0who intervenes to give her space. \u201cI\u2019m only guessing this is to prevent me from saying something or doing something that they think would be a bad look, but that in itself was a bad look,\u201d Cheng told Sky News, where she has been employed as a news presenter and columnist since late last year. Cheng added that such behavior was \u201ctypical\u201d as Chinese officials wouldn\u2019t want \u201cvoices of discord or the presence of someone who\u2019s a bit controversial\u201d when they are aiming to present a \u201cfriendly facade.\u201d Multiple media outlets that were also in attendance at the press conference, including the Guardian and the Daily Telegraph, reported the same details. CNN has requested comment from China\u2019s embassy in Canberra. China\u2019s security state keeps tight control on media and information within the country, where officials are not subject to the kind of robust questioning common to democratic countries. Beijing has also long been condemned by Western nations and rights groups for wrongful and arbitrary detentions. Cheng, previously a business anchor for China\u2019s state broadcaster CGTN, was detained by Chinese authorities in August 2020 on opaque espionage charges that came as diplomatic tensions were escalating between Beijing and Canberra. The mother of two spent more than three years in detention before being released by Beijing and returned home to her family in October, weeks before Albanese made the first visit of an Australian leader to China in seven years. Speaking to Sky News ahead of the news conference Monday, Cheng said it was a \u201cvery emotional day\u201d for her to be covering the major visit. \u201cSurely the fact that one minute I\u2019m sitting in incarceration and being raised as a topic at these visits then the next minute I\u2019m actually covering the visit \u2026 is testament to how wonderful freedom is and democracy is,\u201d she said. Cheng\u2019s detention had been a deep point of contention between the two governments, as has the jailing of writer and democracy activist Yang Hengjun, an Australian citizen who earlier this year was handed a suspended death penalty sentence for espionage following years of detention. Yang has denied the charges, which rights groups have said are politically motivated. Albanese said he raised Yang\u2019s case with Li, but declined to give an update on the health of the democracy activist, who has said he fears he could die in jail due to health issues. When asked during a press conference later about Cheng being blocked from view by officials during the document signing, Albanese said he didn\u2019t see the incident described but added it was \u201cimportant that people be allowed to participate fully and that\u2019s what should happen in this building or anywhere else in Australia.\u201d Pandas and visas The situation Monday stands as a stark reminder of Beijing-Canberra tensions and deep concerns within Australia, a staunch US ally, about China\u2019s authoritarianism amid a trip that was otherwise meant to instill goodwill. The\u00a0four-day visit of Li, China\u2019s No. 2 official, to Australia is the highest-level trip to a US-allied country of any Chinese official in seven years. It comes as the two countries have made strides in mending deep tensions over issues of trade, security and Beijing\u2019s alleged political influence in Australia and the South Pacific. Speaking alongside Li following the signing ceremony, Albanese called the visit \u201canother important step in stabilizing\u201d the relationship. The Chinese premier, speaking via a translator, pledged that China would work with Australia in \u201ca spirit of mutual respect, seeking common ground while showing differences and mutual benefit.\u201d Li announced Sunday that China would provide a new pair of giant pandas to the Adelaide Zoo in southern Australian after its current pair return to China later this year \u2013 extending a classic gesture of friendship from China often called \u201cpanda diplomacy.\u201d China would also\u00a0add Australia to its visa-waiver program, Li said Monday. Details were not immediately announced but follow similar visa arrangements with other countries in recent months as China struggles to draw in more international tourists to boost its flagging economy following years of Covid-19 border restrictions. Li announced a waiver scheme for New Zealand during a visit there Friday. The two leaders agreed to greater military-to-military communication, according to Albanese. The agreement follows recent close encounters of the two powers. In May, a Chinese fighter jet fired flares into the path of an Australian helicopter over the Yellow Sea in a move Albanese condemned at the time as \u201ccompletely unacceptable.\u201d Li\u2019s Australia visit comes as China has gradually rolled back a number of crippling trade controls that it placed on key Australian imports including beef, barley, timber, coal and wine from 2020 after\u00a0then-Prime Minister Scott Morrison called for an international inquiry into the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic in China.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/australia/australia-china-cheng-lei-blocked-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "world"}}

There\u2019s the Art Deco curved crown of the Chrysler Building, the sweeping isosceles triangles that twist around One World Trade Center, the stepped limestone and granite rectangles of the Empire State Building and the triangular prism of the Flatiron Building. And now, a multi-billion-dollar tower featuring floor-to-ceiling glass will add another dimension to the cityscape, according to new details unveiled by New York City Mayor Eric Adams this week. Stretching up 62 stories, a planned office tower at 350 Park Avenue will provide space for more than 6,000 jobs, plus 1.8 million square feet of commercial office space, according to a press release. It will be funded by Vornado Realty Trust, Kenneth Griffin, founder and CEO of global investment firm Citadel, and building and management company Rudin. White columns will frame a new public concourse at the base of the new building on Park Avenue, complete with green space, seating and art displays, images show. Above, landscaped terraces will top each section of the glass-clad tower which will house the offices for Citadel and market making firm Citadel Securities. Adams hailed the project in the release, saying it will help \u201csupercharge our economy and expand New York City\u2019s iconic skyline,\u201d building on \u201ccontinued efforts to energize Midtown Manhattan as the world\u2019s most important business address and an economic engine for working-class New Yorkers.\u201d Architects Foster + Partners have designed the building, which will replace the existing 30-story tower currently at the site in Midtown Manhattan just a few blocks away from landmarks like the Rockefeller Center, St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral and Grand Central Station. As New York continues to deal with the economic aftershocks wrought by the Covid-19 pandemic, Adams and his administration said in their respective statements that they hoped this project would continue the city\u2019s recovery. \u201cThis investment opens a new chapter for Midtown \u2014 and closes the book on those who predicted its demise,\u201d said deputy mayor for operations Meera Joshi. \u201cMidtown\u2019s revitalization is being led by its public realm \u2014 including investments in Fifth Avenue, with the crown jewels of Central Park and Bryant Park at either end. Together, with our business improvement district and parks partners, we are reintroducing Fifth Avenue to the world and creating a vibrant live, work, play community for a new era,\u201d Joshi added. Building this new office space comes at a fraught time for the commercial real estate market as businesses struggle to entice workers back to the office after years of working from home. This has left vast tranches of office space vacant or underused, causing the value of such buildings to plummet at the same time as historically high interest rates have made it harder for real estate developers \u2014\u00a0who often take out huge loans to finance projects \u2014\u00a0to make good on their repayments. The project will begin the city\u2019s public review process early next year and the tower is expected to be completed by 2032, according to the release.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/20/style/park-avenue-skyscraper-new-york-skyline-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_americas_colombia-chiquita-banana-intl-latam", "text": "The execution of banana plantation worker \u201cDavid\u201d\u00a0by right-wing Colombian paramilitary\u00a0members\u00a0in 1997 was as swift as it was brutal. Minutes after his bus was\u00a0stopped at a checkpoint in the coastal region of Urab\u00e1, he was dragged off, beaten to death in front of his fellow passengers, and dumped on the side of the road \u2013 where his killers covered his corpse with a\u00a0banana plant.\u00a0Cows would later feed on his body, according to court documents. The brutality did not end there. His\u00a0daughter and\u00a0sister-in-law\u00a0disappeared weeks later, never to be found again. Death threats were made to another member of the family. What was left of the family soon left Urab\u00e1 for good. He\u00a0was just one of thousands of people targeted by the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia, or AUC, an infamous right-wing terrorist group that, at the height of Colombia\u2019s civil conflict around the turn of the century, was able to mobilize tens of thousands of fighters. More than a quarter century\u00a0later, a landmark civil case in a US federal court this week found banana company Chiquita Brands International liable for financing the\u00a0paramilitary\u00a0group, and ordered Chiquita\u00a0to pay $38.3 million in compensation to \u201cDavid\u2019s\u201d family and those of\u00a0seven other victims \u2013 whose real identities were concealed in court documents. The details of those deaths, which took place between 1997 and 2004, and accounts of\u00a0the impact they had on the families, were read to jurors before\u00a0they deliberated whether Chiquita \u2013 one of the world\u2019s largest banana producers \u2013 had acted \u201cas a reasonable businessperson\u201d by paying the AUC what the company characterized as extortion payments. The families\u00a0argued\u00a0that\u00a0payments from Chiquita to the AUC had helped to prop up the paramilitary group\u2019s violence in Colombia and that the company should therefore be held liable for the group\u2019s murders. The verdict\u00a0has been celebrated as a legal breakthrough.\u00a0According to the lawyers who won the case in Florida, it marks \u201cthe first time an American jury has held a major US corporation accountable for complicity in serious human rights abuses in another country.\u201d \u201cI feel great joy, we waited for so long and suddenly, we won. I had almost lost hope, but God helped us,\u201d one of the plaintiffs told CNN after the ruling. The mother of four daughters\u00a0recalled telling\u00a0the court how her partner\u00a0was\u00a0killed by AUC paramilitaries on November 14, 2003, to pressure the family to sell a banana plantation at below market rate. \u201cI don\u2019t want the money myself, I\u2019ll be gone soon\u2026 but at least, for the girls: may they get some justice now!\u201d she said of the compensation. A bellwether case? The verdict follows a nearly two-decade judicial fight by the families, who sued Chiquita International after a separate court case in 2007.\u00a0In\u00a0that case,\u00a0the company admitted paying $1.7 million in \u201cprotection money\u201d to the AUC \u2013 at that time considered a Foreign Terrorist Organization by the State Department \u2013 and agreed to pay the US government a $25 million fine. However, it\u2019s unlikely to be the last of the matter, and not only because Chiquita has already said it will appeal the verdict. Marco Simons, general counsel for Earth Rights International, a human rights NGO that provided legal assistance to the victims, described his legal strategy as a \u201cbellwether process,\u201d with his team selecting the nine strongest cases they had from over 4,500 complaints. He now hopes many more cases will follow. \u201cIt\u2019s been an honor to represent these victims for the past 17 years. It\u2019s not over yet, but this is a significant step forward, and we hope that this will pave the way for compensation for all the victims,\u201d Simons told a press conference in Washington on Tuesday. Because of Chiquita\u2019s appeal, Simons says it is unlikely any of the victims will receive compensation soon, however, he says the case has sent a strong message to corporations about the need to respect human rights. \u201cUltimately, this money is not going to replace what\u2019s been lost. We\u2019re still talking about horrific abuses that these families have suffered, but the money is important because, unfortunately, the language that corporations understand best is money. Sometimes it takes a significant monetary penalty to change corporate behavior,\u201d Simons said. \u2018Tragic for so many\u2019 Chiquita has maintained in its defense \u2013 both throughout the latest case and in previous litigation \u2013 that it was itself a victim, as it had been forced to pay the AUC protection money. While that argument was not enough to\u00a0convince\u00a0the jury that it had acted \u201cas a reasonable businessperson would have acted under the circumstances,\u201d the company told CNN following the latest verdict that it remained \u201cconfident that our legal position will ultimately prevail.\u201d \u201cThe situation in Colombia was tragic for so many, including those directly affected by the violence there, and our thoughts remain with them and their families. However, that does not change our belief that there is no legal basis for these claims,\u201d the statement read. In its 2007 case against the US Justice Department, the company\u00a0admitted making more than \u201c100 payments to the AUC totaling over $1.7 million.\u201d\u00a0Chiquita recorded the AUC payments as \u201csecurity services,\u201d though the company never received any actual services from these payments,\u00a0according\u00a0to a US Justice Department press release from the time. Eric Holder, who represented Chiquita in the 2007 trial before serving as US Attorney General under President\u00a0Barack Obama, told the court then\u00a0that: \u201cThe company had to pay a variety of terrorist groups for over 15 years because those were the groups that controlled the areas in which the company operated. Not the Colombian government.\u201d However, in that trial, the company ended up admitting in a plea deal that it had willingly continued to pay the AUC even after the group was declared a terrorist organization by the US government in 2001, and even after a senior director lodged an objection to Chiquita\u2019s board reiterating \u201chis strong opinion to sell our operations in Colombia,\u201d due to the protection money issue. Federal attorneys found that Chiquita made $49.4 million in profit from their Colombian operations between 1997 and 2004. A time of \u2018real terror\u2019 The AUC was founded in 1997, during one of the most tragic phases of the Colombian civil conflict, which saw the government wrestle for control against left-wing guerrilla forces, right-wing paramilitaries, and criminal organizations. Around that time, left-wing guerrillas from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and the National Liberation Army (ELN) were moving against the state and terrorizing the civilian population.\u00a0Chiquita said in the 2007 case that it had paid ransoms to the FARC and ELN\u00a0before it turned to the AUC in 1997. Faced with the possibility of an armed communist revolution in the country, Colombian landowners and right-wing sympathizers created groups of\u00a0vigilantes\u00a0to respond to the guerrillas blow for blow. The AUC were once such a\u00a0group and spent the years before their final demobilization\u00a0in 2006 terrorizing the population of northern Colombia to stem the rebellion. At its zenith, the AUC could mobilize tens of thousands of fighters, and was heavily financed by drug trafficking: following demobilization, more than a dozen AUC leaders were extradited on drug charges to the US. \u201cI remember that period, it was real terror,\u201d one of the plaintiffs awarded compensation on Monday told CNN. \u201cMy husband was killed, but my daughter was also raped, you had victims all across town.\u201d In other testimony heard by the jurors in the most recent court case, a minor\u00a0girl\u00a0was forced to watch from a taxi as her mother and stepfather were executed on the side of the street, before being given the equivalent of less than a dollar to return home and survive as an orphan. Colombia today Colombia today is a vastly different country to the one in which the AUC was born. A few years after the demobilization of the AUC, a peace deal in 2016 also brought to an end the 52-year conflict between the government and the FARC, though some dissidents continue to fight. Both right wing paramilitaries and left-wing guerrillas have since been included in transitional justice processes aimed at bringing closure to some of the darkest pages of the conflict. Yet the fear in Urab\u00e1 remains. Some of the AUC\u2019s former members remain at large and have joined a new organized criminal group, the Gulf Clan, that challenges government control in northwestern Colombia. Rights groups say powerful corporate interests continue to collude with local politicians and criminal groups to repress activism, particularly in defense of the environment, which can be a dangerous business in South America. Even so, for at least some of the many victims of the AUC, this week\u2019s court verdict is a reason for optimism.\u00a0One of the plaintiffs who spoke with CNN asked to share her message as an act of defiance. \u201cMy daughter, my son, they\u2019re all \u2018Mom don\u2019t pick up the phone, mom don\u2019t talk.\u2019 But hey, fear can only last until someone decides to speak,\u201d she said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/americas/colombia-chiquita-banana-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "world"}}

This time, on a Las Vegas hiking trail in Nevada, according to the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department (LVMPD). \u201cWe see a lot of weird things when people go hiking like not being prepared for the weather, not bringing enough water \u2026 but check this out,\u201d the department wrote in a\u00a0Facebook post\u00a0on Tuesday showing images of a mirrored structure. \u201cHow did it get up there?\u201d The monolith was found over the weekend near Gass Peak north of Las Vegas, it added. The LVMPD did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment. The pillar is reminiscent to ones popping up all over the world shortly after a 10-feet silver monolith was discovered in late 2020 by a helicopter crew flying over an Utah desert. Similar structures appeared on a\u00a0California mountaintop,\u00a0a forest in Romania,\u00a0and the\u00a0Isle of Wight\u00a0off England\u2019s south coast, to name a few. Sightings have largely slowed down since 2021, but this March, local builder Craig Muir in Powys County, Wales stumbled on one during a walk up a hill. He told the BBC that it seemed to be carefully planted. \u201cThere were no obvious tracks around it and one would think that something like that would cause a lot of mess,\u201d he said. As for the one found on the Las Vegas hiking trail, social media users claimed the monolith isn\u2019t actually new. \u201cAnyone who lives on the west side sees this weekly,\u201d read one comment under the LVMPD\u2019s Facebook post. \u201cYes! Been seeing this for years,\u201d wrote another in a reply, amid posts joking about aliens, pranks and that it could be a portal to other dimensions. \u201cObelisks have unknown power and purpose. I think it\u2019s man made but aliens are still among us. Keep your eyes open and cameras ready,\u201d wrote one user. Others assumed it was a work of art, something that\u2019s been speculated about previous monoliths. Gallerist David Zwirner in 2020 made the argument that the monolith in Utah was the work of the late minimalist sculptor John McCracken, and that it was somehow installed after his death in 2011. He later retracted the theory saying, \u201cWhen you look closely at the photos \u2026 you will see rivets and screws that are not consistent with how John wanted his work to be constructed. He was a perfectionist.\u201d Meanwhile, designer Tom Dunford claimed to the BBC in December 2020 that he\u00a0erected the monolith on the Isle of Wight, \u201cpurely for fun.\u201d \u201cWhen I saw the first one pop up (in Utah) I thought it was brilliant, the second one popped up and I had a text from a friend which said \u2018you\u2019re the man that can do this on the island,\u2019\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely fascinated in futuristic design, science and space. The actual idea sparked when I was walking back to the office and we had an old sheet of mirrored perspex.\u201d In Nevada, Las Vegas police used the opportunity to remind hikers heading out on the trails to be safe out there \u2014 bring plenty of food and water, a first aid kit, a light source, check the weather and tell people where you intend to go and when you expect to return.

South Africa\u2019s win over the USA was the Super 8 round\u2019s opening game. All 12 games in the Super 8 stage are being played across four Caribbean islands \u2013 Antigua, Barbados, St. Lucia and St. Vincent. New steps The USA have been one of the talking points of the T20 World Cup so far, thanks to its shock victory over Pakistan and close defeat by India. But in the Super 8 stage, there is a step-up in quality with only the best teams earning the right to progress. And it was something the USA experienced first-hand from the outset in Antigua, with South Africa starting in strong fashion as opening batter Quinton de Kock aggressively took on the USA\u2019s bowlers. The 31-year-old de Kock, who is also the team\u2019s wicketkeeper, brought his half century up off just 26 balls inside nine overs, with South Africa scoring over a run a ball. The team reached the 100-run mark before the halfway point of its innings. Having entered the Super 8 stage with a 100% winning record, South Africa continued to pile on the runs before de Kock fell after a brilliant display when he was caught in the deep for 74 off of just 40 balls. It got even better for the USA on the very next ball, with Harmeet Singh catching David Miller off his own bowling as the T20 World Cup debutants clawed their way back into the match. As South Africa attempted to rebuild, the USA kept themselves in touch with more wickets, with Proteas captain Aiden Markram the next to fall for 46 off 32 balls off the bowling of the USA\u2019s breakthrough star Saurabh Netravalkar. Thanks to the batting of Heinrich Klaasen and Tristan Stubbs, however, South Africa was able to finish strongly and post a score of 194, meaning the USA faced the daunting task of needing 195 off their 20 overs to claim a historic victory. In response, the USA started strongly through opening batter Steven Taylor, whose ability to hit big shots discombobulated the South African bowlers in the opening overs. However, Taylor was out as he attempted another big shot off Kagiso Rabada\u2019s bowling, only for his effort to fall short and into Klaasen\u2019s waiting hands. Rabada quickly picked up his second wicket of the match in his next over, with Nitish Kumar this time holing out to Stubbs to dent the USA\u2019s run chase. Captain Aaron Jones was next to fall off the spin bowling of Keshav Maharaj before former New Zealand international Corey Anderson was bowled emphatically by Anrich Nortje. The regular fall of wickets stunted any real hopes the USA had of reaching South Africa\u2019s total, despite an impressive half-century from Andries Gous. And they were never able to recover with South Africa eventually able to round out an 18-run victory.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/sport/usa-south-africa-super-8-2024-t20-cricket-world-cup-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_17_europe_uk-mi5-spy-agency-chinese-alert-partygate-intl-latam", "text": "A former opposition lawmaker in Britain\u2019s House of Commons has alleged that the UK\u2019s domestic spy agency MI5 may have issued a rare alert notice in 2022 about an alleged Chinese agent as a distraction from the so-called Partygate scandal, according to testimony before a tribunal looking into the alert. In the alert issued back in January 2022, MI5\u00a0alleged\u00a0Christine Ching Kui Lee had \u201cacted covertly in coordination\u201d on behalf of China\u2019s ruling Communist Party and was \u201cjudged to be involved in political interference activities in the UK.\u201d The alert was issued a day after former Prime Minister Boris Johnson apologized to the House of Commons for the Partygate scandal. Johnson\u2019s premiership came crashing down in 2022 after it emerged that numerous social gatherings took place on his watch \u2013 some of which he personally attended \u2013 at a time when Britons were living under strict rules due to Covid-19. The Investigatory Powers Tribunal in London heard on Monday that Barry Gardiner, former lawmaker from the opposition Labour Party to whom Lee donated over \u00a3500,000 (more than $600,000) between 2014 and 2020, said in a text that he had heard that the MI5 alert had been issued to \u201cdetract attention\u201d from Johnson\u2019s Partygate scandal, PA news agency reported. In a text forwarded to Lee by a friend, Gardiner said that \u201cmany people\u201d had told him \u201cthey believe the reason for putting out the story when they did was to detract attention from Boris\u2019 Partygate apology,\u201d according to PA\u2019s report. Gardiner did not specify exactly who these people making the suggestion were. Nor was any evidence provided to the tribunal Monday to back the allegations. The hearing will continue on Tuesday. CNN reached out to Gardiner\u2019s office but did not receive an immediate response. \u201cI had never believed that the Security Services would be overtly party political in that way [\u2026] What has also been suggested to me is that the Security Services may have wished to \u2018pick a fight\u2019 or to \u2018detract attention\u2019 from something else and that we were simply collateral damage,\u201d read a portion of a text from Gardiner that Lee\u2019s lawyer read out to the hearing, according to PA. CNN has also reached out to the UK\u2019s Home Office and Boris Johnson\u2019s office for comment. The MI5 alert in question\u00a0also alleged that Lee had been facilitating \u201cfinancial donations to political parties, Parliamentarians, aspiring Parliamentarians and individuals seeking political office in the UK, including facilitating donations to political entities on behalf of foreign nationals.\u201d \u201cMs Lee denies the allegations and is taking legal action against the Security Service with her son, Daniel Wilkes, who lost his job with Mr Gardiner following the alert, arguing that issuing the alert was unlawful and interfered with their human rights,\u201d PA reported. Gardiner served as a Labour MP between 1997 and 2024. He was the chairman of the now-disbanded Chinese in Britain All-Party Parliamentary Group, on which Lee sat. It was not illegal for Lee to make the donations as the UK did not have a foreign agents registration act at the time, nor was it illegal for a British citizen or foreign national working in the UK to be affiliated with the Chinese Communist Party. Lee is listed as a British national in the UK\u2019s corporate registry. The UK has since introduced a foreign agents registration act, which is expected to come into force later this year. In a statement to CNN in 2022, Gardiner said he had not benefited personally from Lee\u2019s donations in any way, adding that the money had been properly reported and its source verified. CNN\u2019s Andrew Raine contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/europe/uk-mi5-spy-agency-chinese-alert-partygate-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_17_africa_british-army-abandoned-children-kenya-intl", "text": "Seventeen-year-old Marian Pannalossy cuts a striking figure wherever she goes in Archer\u2019s Post, a small town 200 miles north of Nairobi. She lives alone and is light-skinned in a place where mixed-race people are a rarity and therefore ostracized. \u201cThey call me \u2018mzungu maskini,\u2019 or a poor white girl,\u201d she told CNN at her single-room house, a tremor in her voice.\u00a0\u201cThey always say \u2018Why are you here? Just look for connections so that you can go to your own people. You don\u2019t belong here. You\u2019re not supposed to be here suffering.\u2019\u201d Marian believes that her father was a British soldier, but she has never met him. She does not even know his name. Marian is among a group of mixed-race children whose mothers say they were conceived after rape by British soldiers training in Kenya. Her mother, Lydia Juma, was among hundreds of Kenyan women who filed complaints with the UK military over the years, as documented by Kenya\u2019s human rights body. \u201cI don\u2019t know why God is punishing me. I don\u2019t understand,\u201d Juma said through tears in a powerful \u202f2011 documentary, \u2018The Rape of the Samburu Women.\u2019 Marian, aged four at the time, sat on her lap, sometimes hugging her mother as she wept and recounted how she was violated and the suffering she had endured since. \u00a0\u00a0Juma\u2019s live-in boyfriend, with whom she had two older children, left her after she gave birth to Marian, a mixed-race child, because rape is a taboo in their culture. \u201cThe moment he saw that the child is \u2018white,\u2019 he went, and he went forever,\u201d she said in the film. Juma died two years after that interview without ever finding the man she says raped her. Mixed-race children continue to be born in the remote villages where the British Army trains its soldiers in Kenya. The British Army Training Unit, Kenya (BATUK), is headquartered in the town of Nanyuki, about 70 miles southwest of Archer\u2019s Post. BATUK is currently under investigation by the Defense, Intelligence and Foreign Relations committee of Kenya\u2019s National Assembly. It has held public hearings in several areas where British troops train and heard a litany of complaints about abuse, exploitation, and sexual assaults from communities around them. It intends to hear from BATUK officials and the British High Commissioner to Kenya at the end of its work later this month, according to a schedule shared with CNN. One of the more contentious accusations against British soldiers involves the case of Agnes Wanjiru. Wanjiru, a 21-year-old Kenyan woman, vanished in 2012 after entering a hotel with British soldiers, according to reports. Her body was later found in a septic tank. Despite a Kenyan inquest ruling her death a murder and the reported identification of a suspect by fellow soldiers, the British soldier allegedly involved hasn\u2019t faced charges. Wanjiru\u2019s family believes British officials are\u00a0indifferent to her case\u00a0and pleaded with the King for help during his visit to Kenya. A British High Commission spokesperson said it takes all allegations raised by the community seriously and it will ensure thorough investigations. \u201cAll sexual activity which involves the abuse of power, including buying sex whether in the UK or abroad, is prohibited,\u201d the British High Commission, speaking on behalf of BATUK, said in a statement to CNN. \u201cWe are committed to preventing sexual exploitation in any form and investigate and hold to account any Service Personnel found to be involved in it.\u201d \u2018British boys behaving badly\u2019 Britain pays Kenya about $400,000 a year to allow its soldiers to train in the East African country, mostly in the expansive wildlife conservancies in Laikipia and Samburu counties. Kenya renewed the defense pact in 2021 despite strong local opposition. BATUK has a permanent training base in Nanyuki, to the south of those wildlife conservancies, with 100 full-time staff. The Defense, Intelligence and Foreign Relations committee\u2019s work has renewed scrutiny of the British Army\u2019s operations in Kenya and once again brought attention to the cases of the women who have accused soldiers of rape over several decades. Allegations of rape and other crimes, including murder, by British soldiers deployed there date back to the 1950s. \u201cThis to us is an example of British boys behaving badly,\u201d said Marion Mutugi,\u00a0a commissioner for the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights.\u201cThis is a matter of taking care of the vulnerable in our society who our constitution says require special protection.\u201d She\u2019s referring to hundreds of women from the mostly pastoralist Maasai and Samburu communities who accused the British Army of rapes in the 1970s and 80s. They were represented by the British lawyer Martyn Day in a landmark civil case in London in the early 2000s. Ntoyie Lenkanan, 72, was among the complainants in the British case. \u00a0\u00a0Nearly forty years later, her voice trembles with emotion and barely controlled anger as she recounts her ordeal. \u201cI was going to fetch water when I was ambushed by a group of British soldiers who were hiding in the grass near the river. One of them grabbed me and raped me,\u201d she told CNN at her home in DolDol, about 35 miles north of Nanyuki. She has been waiting years for an official acknowledgment of the violation and compensation, but neither has come. A few miles from Lenkanan\u2019s home in the sparsely populated arid lands of DolDol, Saitet\u00a0Noltwalal\u00a0who is in her 70s, sits under a tree. She is blind and frail, relying on her family for everything. She, too, says she was raped by a British soldier at a hill near her home a few decades ago but she no longer remembers the exact period. \u201cI have been waiting a long time and I can no longer fend for myself. I wouldn\u2019t like what happened to me to happen to anyone else,\u201d she said. Her quality of life nosedived after the rape as she miscarried the child and lost her eyesight shortly after, she said. Some of her peers who accused the British Army of sexual violations have died while waiting for redress. In 2007, Britain\u2019s Ministry of Defense dismissed claims\u202fof rape brought by 2,187 women, Lenkanan and Noltwalal among them, saying \u201cthere was no reliable evidence to support any single allegation.\u201d A Royal Military Police investigation at the time concluded that most of the Kenyan evidence appeared to have been fabricated.The UK investigators did not conduct DNA tests on any of the 69 mixed-race children alleged to have been born\u00a0from rape by British soldiers. Some of the women testified in 2009 about being preyed on by British soldiers as they went about their daily chores to Kenya\u2019s Truth, Justice, and Reconciliation Commission, set up in 2008 to hear from victims of injustices spanning from 1963 to 2008, including ethnic conflicts and political violence among others. And Kenya\u2019s Truth Justice and reconciliation commission claims the government in Nairobi lost the case files, without explanation. \u201cThe most horrific allegation of rape is said to have (occurred) in October 1997 at Archer\u2019s Post where 30 women were gang raped by British soldiers, often at knifepoint and sometimes inside the victims\u2019 own manyattas (compounds),\u201d the 2009 report said. A new day in court British soldiers can now be sued in Kenyan courts for any wrongdoing as part of a new addition to the 2021 defense pact signed between both countries. It means many of these women may finally have their day in court. Kenya also has no statute of limitations on cases involving alleged human rights abuses. So, 17 years later, lawyer Kelvin Kubai has signed up more than 300 of the women who previously brought rape claims and is working to reintroduce the case in Kenyan courts. Seventeen-year-old Marian will be the lead plaintiff. \u201cIt is traumatic and psychologically disturbing to people like Marian and many others who continue to see the British training amidst them with all these unresolved trauma and historical injustices,\u201d Kubai told CNN after meeting some of the pastoralist women who allege wrongdoing by British soldiers. \u201cWe can win because we have a very progressive constitution. The Kenyan legal system offers a better redress than what is available in the UK,\u201d he said. Abandoned children Kenyan women say they continue to struggle for recognition even for children conceived in consensual relationships with British soldiers. Generica Namoru, 28, says she started a consensual relationship in 2017 with a soldier while she worked at the BATUK headquarters in Nanyuki. \u201cHe went back to the UK when I was two months pregnant. He is the one that chose her name when she was born,\u201d she told CNN. Namoru says the soldier sent his passport and other personal information for the newborn\u2019s birth certificate. Her daughter Nicole, five, bears his last name, she told CNN, but he has never supported her. Namoru is unemployed and has to \u201chustle\u201d for her and Nicole\u2019s upkeep by selling fresh water in the semi-arid town where they live. \u201cI\u2019m a woman with a \u2018white\u2019 child. It\u2019s not easy for my family especially because a child is expensive,\u201d she said, pointing out that Nicole has no health insurance nor a permanent home. \u201cShe\u2019s suffering for no reason. I want him to take care of her education, health and shelter. Nothing else.\u201d In the meantime, Kabui the lawyer and his team have set up a crowdfunding campaign to support Marian, Nicole, and other \u201cabandoned children of British Army soldiers in Kenya with education and legal fees,\u201d he told CNN. Namoru says that she has tried without success to get the Kenyan or British governments to locate her ex-boyfriend and compel him to take financial responsibility for his daughter. The British High Commission in Nairobi told CNN that it cooperates with local child support authorities in paternity claims. Neither Nicole nor Marian have UK citizenship even though they qualify if they can prove their fathers are English. \u201cIt\u2019s not like these kids are looking for a free ticket to the UK. We\u2019re just saying that they deserve to get parental\u00a0care from their fathers that every child deserves,\u201d Mutugi of the Human Rights Commission said, claiming that the British government had shown no interest in resolving the cases. \u201cThese children deserve British citizenship. They\u2019re British kids. Their fathers were British!\u201d Mutugi said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/africa/british-army-abandoned-children-kenya-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_06_18_asia_thailand-same-sex-marriage-intl-hnk", "text": "Thailand will become the first nation in Southeast Asia to legalize same-sex marriage after the kingdom\u2019s Senate approved a marriage equality bill on Tuesday, with supporters calling it a \u201cmonumental step forward for LGBTQ+ rights.\u201d The Senate voted overwhelmingly in favor of passing the bill following a final reading, with 130 senators voting in favor. Only four members opposed the bill. The bill still requires endorsement from the king before marriage equality can become reality in Thailand, but this process is considered a formality. The law will then come into effect 120 days after it is published in the royal gazette. The result of the vote means that Thailand will become only the third place in Asia to allow for marriage equality after\u00a0Taiwan legalized\u00a0same-sex marriage in 2019 and\u00a0Nepal in 2023. \u201cThe bill represents a monumental step forward for LGBTQ+ rights in Thailand,\u201d Panyaphon Phiphatkhunarnon, founder of Love Foundation \u2013 an NGO campaigning for\u00a0LGBTQ+ equality in\u00a0Thailand \u2013 told CNN. \u201cThe potential impact of this bill is immense. It would not only change the lives of countless couples but also contribute to a more just and equitable society for all.\u201d The bill grants LGBTQ+ couples the same legal rights and recognition as heterosexual couples, including rights related to inheritance, adoption and health care decision-making. \u201cBeyond the legal implications, the passage of this bill would send a powerful message of acceptance and inclusion,\u201d Panyaphon said. \u201cIt would inspire the younger generation to come out and live their lives authentically, it would showcase Thailand as a progressive and inclusive country \u2013 attracting tourists and businesses \u2026  and will foster a culture change where LGBTQ+ individuals feel accepted and supported.\u201d Bangkok residents Pokpong Jitjaiyai and Watit Benjamonkolchai say they plan to get married as soon as the law is passed. \u201cWhen I was young, people said people like us couldn\u2019t have a family, can\u2019t have children, so marriage was impossible,\u201d Pokpong told CNN. \u201cOver 10 years ago, we could not live together the way we are now. We could never be our true selves, the way it is now\u2026 and now I can freely say that I am gay.\u201d Pokpong said he hopes the marriage equality bill will start a \u201cdomino effect\u201d in other countries. \u201cI want the people around the world see how love is. Love is love,\u201d he said. The marriage equality bill was supported by all the major parties and marks a significant step in cementing the country\u2019s reputation as one of the friendliest in the region toward gay, lesbian and transgender people. Previous attempts\u00a0to legalize marriage equality over the past decade had stalled. In 2020, the Constitutional Court ruled that Thailand\u2019s current law, which stipulates marriage being between a man and a woman, was constitutional. Some of the major political parties contesting last year\u2019s election pledged to push marriage equality as part of their campaign, including the progressive Move Forward Party, which won the most seats. But that party, which had a huge youth following, was unable to form a government when former rivals joined forces to keep it out of office. Both the future of the party and of its popular former leader Pita Limjaroenrat remain uncertain as they face a slew of prosecutions. Nonetheless Thailand\u2019s Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin, of the Pheu Thai Party, had also promised to bring the marriage equality bill to parliament. Dressed in a rainbow shirt, Srettha attended Pride Month celebrations in Bangkok earlier in June, joining a massive parade through the capital\u2019s streets. \u201cIt is a basic right to choose who to love,\u201d he said in a post on X on June 1. Srettha has been keen to showcase Thailand as a welcoming destination for\u00a0LGBTQ+ people, including voicing support for a bid to host World Pride in 2030. \u201cWe have come far in our journey towards social equality. I want to reaffirm my government\u2019s commitment in pushing for the realization of the Equal Marriage Bill which today we can visibly see the light at the end of the tunnel,\u201d Srettha said on X on June 1. \u201cWe look forward to hosting of the World Pride in 2030 in Thailand.\u201d Regional outlier As only the third territory in Asia to embrace marriage equality, Thailand remains an outlier in a region that has been slow to grant LGBTQ+ rights and where members of the community often face discrimination, prejudice and even violence. Rising religious conservatism and colonial-era laws have make life hard for the LGBTQ+ community in much of Southeast Asia, where same-sex relations are criminalized in several countries, including Myanmar and Brunei. In Indonesia, homosexual sex is not illegal except in the extremely conservative province of Aceh. But LGBTQ+ people have faced widespread discrimination, police raids, vigilante attacks and open hostility by Indonesian authorities and Islamic groups across the country. Indonesia\u2019s new Criminal Code, ratified in 2022, makes consensual sex outside of marriage a criminal offense and rights groups say this will disproportionately impact LGBTQ+ people as same-sex couples cannot marry in Indonesia. In Malaysia, homosexuality is a crime punishable by fines and prison terms of up to 20 years. The Muslim majority country that has seen a rise in conservative attitudes in recent years. Rights groups say the LGBTQ+ community faces growing intolerance in Malaysia and accuse the government of being at least partly to blame. Singapore only repealed a colonial-era law that criminalized sex between men in 2022 but the Singapore government has reiterated its opposition to gay marriage and vowed to make it harder for people to legally challenge the government\u2019s policies. In Singapore, couples in registered marriages have access to greater housing subsidies and adoption rights than single people. Japan is the only Group of Seven (G7) country that has not recognized either\u00a0same-sex civil unions\u00a0or\u00a0same-sex marriage, despite recent high court decisions that ruled not allowing same-sex marriage is unconstitutional. Last year, India\u2019s top court declined to legally recognize same-sex unions in a landmark ruling, after campaigners had sought to obtain the right to marry under Indian law. In mainland China, Beijing has\u00a0widened crackdowns\u00a0on LGBTQ activists and groups in recent years, with Chinese leader Xi Jinping increasingly stressing the ruling Communist Party\u2019s absolute control over every aspect of society. In other jurisdictions, campaigners have made small gains on a case by case basis as they appeal through the courts. South Korea does not legally recognize same-sex marriage but in February 2023, a South Korean court ruled in favor of a same-sex couple seeking equal health benefits. South Korea has also drawn international criticism for\u00a0its military penal code,\u00a0which makes same-sex relations between men punishable by up to two years in prison. In past years, dozens have been arrested in what critics have called a \u201cgay witch-hunt.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/asia/thailand-same-sex-marriage-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_middleeast_hezbollah-drone-video-israel-haifa-intl-latam", "text": "The leader of Lebanese militant group Hezbollah threatened Wednesday to target the European island of Cyprus if war breaks out between Israel and Lebanon. \u201cCyprus will be part of this war too\u201d if it opens its airports and bases to Israeli forces, Hassan Nasrallah said in a televised address that came just a day after Israel warned the powerful Iran-backed militant group that the prospect of \u201call-out war\u201d was \u201cgetting very close.\u201d The comments by the Hezbollah leader are the first time he has threatened Cyprus, a member of the European Union that lies in the Mediterranean sea, roughly 125 miles (200 kilometers) from Lebanon, and which has held joint military exercises with Israel since 2014 and as recently as last year. Nasrallah\u2019s threat came as part of a fiery response to Israel\u2019s warning that saw him boast of his group\u2019s growing capabilities and threaten to \u201cshake the pillars\u201d of Israel if a war \u201cwere to be imposed on Lebanon.\u201d Tensions between Hezbollah and Israel have been rising since the October 7 Hamas attacks and the ensuing military campaign by the Israel Defense Forces in Gaza. In recent weeks, the intensity of cross-border attacks between the two has increased, raising concerns over the prospect of a full-blown war. Those prospects took a turn for the worse Tuesday, when Hezbollah flaunted a 9-minute video filmed by a drone showing civilian and military locations in and around one of Israel\u2019s largest cities, Haifa. The video prompted Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz to warn of an \u201call-out war\u201d in which \u201cHezbollah will be destroyed, and Lebanon severely beaten.\u201d On Wednesday, Nassrallah celebrated the video as evidence of its growing ability to gather intelligence. \u201cThe enemy knows that no place in the entire (state) is safe from our missiles, and it won\u2019t be arbitrary. Everything will be deliberately targeted,\u201d Nasrallah said in his speech. \u201cWe have long hours of footage of Haifa, of the outskirts of Haifa, and what comes after Haifa, and after after Haifa,\u201d Nasrallah said, in an apparent reference to a Hezbollah slogan from the 2006 war with Israel, when the group\u2019s rockets hit Haifa for the first time. In response to the threat by Nasrallah, Cyprus\u2019 President Nikos Christodoulides said the island was in \u201cno way involved in the war conflicts.\u201d \u201cThe Republic of Cyprus is not part of the problem. The Republic of Cyprus is part of the solution,\u201d Christodoulides said. \u201cAnd our role in this, as demonstrated, for example, through the humanitarian corridor, is recognized not only by the Arab world but by the international community as a whole.\u201d What the drone footage shows Parts of the Hezbollah footage, filmed in the daytime, claimed to show Krayot, a cluster of \u201chighly populated\u201d residential cities north of the Israeli city of Haifa and 28 km (17 miles) south of the Lebanese border, along with malls and high rises. Other parts claimed to show a military complex near Haifa belonging to Israeli weapons manufacturer Rafael \u2013 including Iron Dome batteries, missile storage sites and radar sites \u2013 and military boats, ships and oil storage depots in the port of Haifa.  CNN analysis has geolocated the video to a number of locations around Haifa. Those locations include a number of sensitive areas, including at least two military installations: a base in northern Haifa and the port of Haifa. The drone also flew over the oil tanks that sit north of Haifa, the Haifa airport and several residential areas. CNN also analyzed the shadows in the videos, which indicate the drone mission over Haifa lasted multiple hours, or took place over multiple days. The analysis shows parts of the video have been sped up. Weapons expert Wim Zwijnenburg, project leader for humanitarian disarmament at the Dutch peace organization PAX, told CNN that a drone visible in the footage appears to be \u201can Iranian-origin model of a Qasaf-2k, possibly manufactured locally.\u201d \u2018Psychological terror\u2019 The mayor of Haifa, Yona Yahav, has described the video as \u201cpsychological terror\u201d and demanded a protection plan for his city, criticizing IDF commanders for not having visited Haifa since the October 7 Hamas attack. \u201cI demand that the government present a plan for the massive defense of Haifa and find a military solution to eliminate the threat posed from the north,\u201d Yahav told Israeli radio station\u00a0Reshet Bet. Hezbollah has claimed the video was the \u201cfirst episode,\u201d suggesting more videos would surface from deep inside Israeli territory. A Hezbollah lawmaker in the Lebanese parliament who referenced the video in a social media post has also suggested more is to come. \u201cThis is what the party [Hezbollah] announced and you saw, but what is hidden is greater and greater and greater! Haifa and beyond, beyond, and beyond Haifa,\u201d Ibrahim Mousawi said in the post. His message appears to be a reference to a phrase coined by Nasrallah during the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war, when he said the militant group would fire rockets at Haifa \u201cand beyond Haifa\u201d. However, Israeli government spokesman David Mencer called the drone video the usual \u201cmischief making propaganda\u201d and said \u201cwe know precisely how to deal with [Hezbollah] one way or the other \u2013 diplomatically or through military means.\u201d Israeli military increasing readiness Israel has been preparing for the possibility that diplomatic efforts to reduce hostilities with Hezbollah could fail. The release of the footage comes as Israel\u2019s military says it has \u201capproved and validated\u201d operational plans for an offensive in Lebanon and made decisions on increasing the readiness of troops in the field. The plans were approved by the commanding officer of the Northern Command and the head of the Operations Directorate during a joint situational assessment to prepare for the continuation of combat, the IDF said in a statement. The approval of the operational plans does not mean a war between Israel and Hezbollah is imminent \u2013 but it does signal that Israel intends to be ready for such a scenario. In response to the Hezbollah video, the IDF Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi said Wednesday that the Israeli military was \u201cpreparing and coming up with solutions to deal with these and other capabilities. \u201cWe have many more forces in the IDF that are engaged in an offensive against Hezbollah,\u201d Halevi said in a conversation with Israeli troops at an aerial defense battery along Israel\u2019s northern border with Lebanon. \u201cI believe the enemy knows only a little about the capabilities we have and will face them, when necessary, at the right time,\u201d Halevi added. Hezbollah has fired more than 5,000 rockets, missiles and drones at northern Israel since October 7, claiming that its attacks are in solidarity with the Palestinian people. Hezbollah has said in the past that it will only stop firing on Israel if Israel stops the war in Gaza. For its part, Israel has carried out hundreds of strikes in Lebanon and evacuated approximately 60,000 residents from the northern border. More than 90,000 Lebanese have also fled their homes in the area. The US has sought a diplomatic off-ramp to avoid a wider war that could spread to the region, sending special envoy Amos Hochstein to Israel and Lebanon this week to try to ease tensions. Israel and Hezbollah exchanged more cross-border fire on Wednesday in the latest round of hostilities on the combative border, a day after the visit by the Biden aide ended. Hezbollah revealed that four of its fighters from southern Lebanon were killed without specifying when or how they died. The Iran-backed group also announced it had targeted Metula and Kryat Shmona in northern Israel with drones. Videos shared by Lebanese media close to Hezbollah showed plumes of smoke rising from the southern Lebanese village of Burghalia after an Israeli strike, with more strikes on other Lebanese villages including Mais Al-Jabal, Talat Al-Awaida, Al-Khiyam and Hula, according to the state-run news agency NNA.

{"id": "2024_06_18_asia_us-condemns-china-scs-collision-philippines-intl-hnk", "text": "The United States on Monday condemned China over a collision with the Philippines in the disputed South China Sea, the latest in a series of increasingly fraught confrontations that have raised the potential of a flashpoint for global conflict in the vital waterway. A Chinese vessel and a Philippine supply ship collided near Second Thomas Shoal in the contested\u00a0Spratly Islands early Monday, according to statements from both nations, which blamed each other for the incident. China\u2019s Coast Guard said it took measures including \u201cwarnings and interceptions, boarding inspections and forced evictions\u201d against the Philippine vessels. China claims \u201cindisputable sovereignty\u201d over almost all of the South China Sea, and most of the islands and sandbars within it, including many features that are hundreds of miles from mainland China. Multiple governments, including Manila, hold competing claims. In a post on X, Washington\u2019s ambassador to Manila MaryKay Carlson said the US condemned China\u2019s \u201caggressive, dangerous maneuvers,\u201d which \u201ccaused bodily injury\u201d and \u201cdamaged Philippine vessels.\u201d Neither the Philippines nor China reported injuries or damage from the collision, which comes just weeks after Philippine President Ferdinand \u201cBongbong\u201d Marcos Jr. warned that the death of any Filipino citizen at the hands of another country in the South China Sea would be \u201cvery close\u201d to an act of war. Marcos has sought closer ties with the US, which\u00a0has repeatedly stressed Washington\u2019s \u201cironclad commitment\u201d to a 1951 mutual defense treaty between the US and the Philippines that stipulates both sides would help defend each other if either were attacked by a third party. The incident Monday is the latest in a string of recent confrontations between Manila and Beijing that have raised concerns among Western observers of potentially developing into an international incident if China, a global power, decides to act more forcefully against the Philippines. US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Monday the \u201cUnited States stands with its ally the Philippines and condemns the escalatory and irresponsible actions\u201d by China. Meanwhile, Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell on Monday discussed the collision with Philippine Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs Maria Theresa Lazaro. China had \u201cobstructed the Philippines from executing a lawful maritime operation in the South China Sea, interfering with the Philippines\u2019 freedom of navigation,\u201d Campbell said, according to a State Department readout. The latest incident marks the first run-in between the two countries since a new law in China took effect Saturday to authorize its coast guard to seize foreign ships and detain crews suspected of trespassing for up to 60 days without trial. The Chinese coast guard on Monday said a Philippine supply ship \u201cignored China\u2019s repeated solemn warnings\u201d and \u201cdeliberately and dangerously\u201d approached a Chinese vessel in \u201can unprofessional manner,\u201d resulting in a collision. \u201cThe Philippines is entirely responsible for this,\u201d the coast guard said in a statement, a charge rejected by the Philippine military as \u201cdeceptive and misleading.\u201d Instead, Philippine authorities accused Chinese ships of \u201cdangerous maneuvers\u201d that included \u201cramming and towing\u201d of Philippines vessels. In a statement on X, Philippine army spokesperson Col. Francel Margareth Padilla said the \u201cmain issue remains to be the illegal presence and actions of Chinese vessels within the Philippines\u2019 exclusive economic zone, which infringes on our sovereignty and sovereign rights.\u201d \u2018Dangerous and reckless behavior\u2019 In 2016, an international tribunal in The Hague ruled in favor of the Philippines in a landmark maritime dispute, which concluded that China has no legal basis to claim historic rights to the bulk of the South China Sea. But Beijing has ignored the ruling. Instead it has increasingly pushed its territorial claims in the strategically important and resource-rich waterway. Over the past year China Coast Guard ships \u2013 reinforced by maritime militia boats \u2013 have been involved in multiple clashes that have damaged Philippine ships and seen Filipino sailors injured by water cannon. Known as Ayungin Shoal in the Philippines and Ren\u2019ai Jiao in China, Second Thomas Shoal is a submerged teardrop-shaped reef\u00a0located about 200 kilometers (125 miles) from the Philippine island of Palawan. It lies in the Spratly Islands, a mostly uninhabited archipelago where oil and gas reserves have been found, and which is claimed by China, the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan. The Philippine ship was on a mission Monday to supply its soldiers stationed on the BRP Sierra Madre, a rusting US-built Philippine Navy landing craft that was run aground deliberately in 1999, with a national flag hoisted on board, to assert the Philippines\u2019 territorial claims over Second Thomas Shoal. China Coast Guard spokesperson Gan Yu\u00a0on Monday accused a supply ship and two rubber boats from the Philippines of \u201cillegally\u201d delivering supplies to the stranded warship. \u201cWe once again warn the Philippines: Any form of infringement and provocation is futile. The Chinese Coast Guard is on full alert and ready to resolutely safeguard national territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests,\u201d Gan said in a statement. In a departure from past confrontations with China when his team were quick to issue statements and visuals, Philippine Coast Guard spokesperson Commodore Jay Tarriela provided no comment to CNN on the collision. The Armed Forces of the Philippines also declined to give details of the latest run-in. Instead, Philippine officials made broad statements denouncing China\u2019s actions. \u201cChina\u2019s dangerous and reckless behavior in the West Philippine Sea shall be resisted by the (Armed Forces of the Philippines.) Their behavior contravenes their statements of good faith and decency,\u201d said Philippine Defense Minister Gilberto C. Teodoro, Jr. \u201cWe will exert our utmost in order to fulfill our sworn mandate to protect our territorial integrity, sovereignty, and sovereign rights. It should now be clear to the international community that China\u2019s actions are the true obstacles to peace and stability in the South China Sea.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/asia/us-condemns-china-scs-collision-philippines-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "world"}}

Staff Sgt. Gordon Black was arrested in May on charges of theft in the far eastern city of Vladivostok, where he had traveled to visit a woman, believed to be his girlfriend. He was accused of stealing 10,000 rubles (roughly $112) from her when he visited Russia in April after meeting her in South Korea, state news agency TASS previously reported. Black was also accused of assaulting the woman during a quarrel. The US soldier did not admit to charges of threatening to kill the woman, but partially admitted guilt to theft charges, RIA Novosti previously reported. Black will appeal the sentence handed down by the court in Vladivostok, his lawyer said Wednesday, according to TASS. Speaking to the Pervomaisky District Court on Monday, Black said he took the money from the woman\u2019s purse, but the next day transferred $125 to her. He said he spent the money on food and three nights in a hotel, according to RIA. He also said the woman was to collect a deposit of 10,000 rubles from the landlord after the end of the lease of the apartment for which he was paying, RIA said. The woman also spoke in court on Monday, saying she was not yet ready to\u00a0reconcile with Black since the damage had not yet been compensated. Black\u2019s sentencing comes against the backdrop of heightened tensions between Washington and Moscow, as\u00a0Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine\u00a0rages on. A number of Americans are being held in Russia, including two who have been declared as wrongfully detained by the US State Department \u2013 former Marine\u00a0Paul Whelan and Wall Street Journal reporter\u00a0Evan Gershkovich. Gershkovich, 32, will stand trial behind closed doors in the city of Yekaterinburg from June 26, TASS reported Monday, citing the court\u2019s press service. The journalist has been imprisoned since he was arrested while on a reporting trip in March last year by the FSB, Russia\u2019s federal security service, which accused him of trying to obtain state secrets. If convicted, he faces up to 20 years in prison. Gershkovich, the US government and the Wall Street Journal have vehemently denied the charges against him. The\u00a0White House has previously alleged the Kremlin\u00a0is using Gershkovich, the first American reporter detained in Russia on allegations of spying since the Cold War, as a geopolitical hostage. The US government has repeatedly warned American citizens not to travel to Russia.

{"id": "2024_06_17_middleeast_netanyahu-disbands-israeli-war-cabinet-intl", "text": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has dissolved his war cabinet, an Israeli official told CNN Monday, just over a week after opposition leader Benny Gantz withdrew from the body. Decision-making will now move back to the government\u2019s main security cabinet, the Israeli official said, claiming Netanyahu \u201cwill hold smaller forums on sensitive matters.\u201d The war cabinet, set up five days after the Hamas-led terrorist attacks against Israel on October 7, had five members: Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, opposition leader Benny Gantz, and two \u201cobservers,\u201d Ron Dermer and Gadi Eisenkot. But Gantz \u2013 seen as Netanyahu\u2019s most formidable political opponent \u2013 announced his \u201ccomplex and painful\u201d decision to withdraw from the cabinet last week, citing Netanyahu\u2019s failure to devise a strategy for the conflict in Gaza and the future governance of the Strip. \u201cNetanyahu prevents us from moving forward to a real victory [in Gaza],\u201d Gantz said June 9. He accused Netanyahu of putting his own personal political considerations ahead of a post-war strategy for the Gaza Strip, claiming that \u201cfateful strategic decisions are met with hesitancy and procrastination due to political considerations,\u201d and urged the prime minister to hold an election in the coming months. \u201cI call on Netanyahu: set an agreed election date. Do not let our people be torn apart,\u201d Gantz said. In April, Gantz called\u00a0for early elections\u00a0to be held as soon as September, ahead of the one-year anniversary of the war, saying \u201cIsraeli society needs to renew its contract with its leadership.\u201d The month before, he had traveled to Washington, DC, to meet with US Vice President Kamala Harris in a trip not sanctioned by the Israeli government. Gantz often surpasses the prime minister in popularity, according to opinion polls.\u00a0A survey published Friday\u00a0by the Israeli Maariv newspaper showed support for Gantz at 42%, compared to 34% for Netanyahu. Gantz\u2019s resignation sparked calls from far-right members in Netanyahu\u2019s governing coalition, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, to join the war cabinet. Both men were earlier pointedly excluded from the cabinet at Gantz\u2019s behest. By dismantling the cabinet, Netanyahu may have avoided having to accede to Ben-Gvir\u2019s calls to join the cabinet, which could have further strained Israel\u2019s relations with the United States, or having to reject his demands, which could have angered the more extreme wing of Netanyahu\u2019s coalition. Another interpretation is that without Gantz \u2013 and Eisenkot who also resigned \u2013 in it, there was no longer any point in keeping the war cabinet going. Instead, an Israeli official tells CNN, Netanyahu will in future hold smaller forums to discuss sensitive matters relating to the war with Hamas. It\u2019s unclear whether Ben-Gvir will be excluded from these as well. As National Security Minister, Ben-Gvir attends Israel\u2019s security cabinet alongside 12 other ministers, including Smotrich, Gallant and Foreign Minister Israel Katz. Both Ben-Gvir and Smotrich have urged that Israel sustain its assault on Gaza until Hamas is defeated completely, and threatened to topple Netanyahu\u2019s government if he accepts a peace proposal that was first publicly announced by US President Joe Biden last month. After the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) on Saturday announced a daily \u201ctactical pause\u201d of military activity along a route in southern Gaza to allow aid to be distributed, Ben-Gvir condemned the decision. \u201cWhoever decided on a \u2018tactical pause\u2019 for the purpose of a humanitarian transition, especially at a time when the best of our soldiers are falling in battle, is evil and a fool who should not continue to be in his position,\u201d he said. US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Monday the dissolution of the war cabinet did not change the Biden administration\u2019s \u201cfundamental assessment\u201d of the war in Gaza, saying \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to have very direct and candid conversations\u201d with \u201cwhatever government is in place.\u201d He added that the US \u201cvery much\u201d welcomed the announcement of the \u201ctactical pause\u201d \u2013 but said the US would judge Israel \u201cby the results.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not just a question of humanitarian pauses, it\u2019s to the question of how much aid gets delivered. The pause ultimately is only a means to an end,\u201d he said. Aid groups are saying that no difference has yet been seen on the ground.

{"id": "2024_06_14_americas_onboard-the-russian-warship-visiting-cuba", "text": "In twelve years of living in Cuba, I have waited in all kinds of lines. Lines to buy food, lines to pay bills, lines just because people were lining up for something maybe worth lining up for. But now I was in a line for something unexpected:\u00a0to\u00a0board\u00a0a Russian warship docked in Havana\u2019s harbor. When a Russian diplomat told me that starting on Thursday, the Admiral Gorshkov frigate would offer tours to the public for three days, I was somewhat skeptical. The Gorshkov is one of the most modern vessels in the Russian fleet, capable of firing hypersonic missiles that travel at more than 6,000 miles per hour. I had trouble imagining that\u00a0President Vladimir\u00a0Putin\u2019s prized\u00a0ship would be opened for anyone to see. When the Gorshkov arrived in Cuba\u00a0on Wednesday, it fired a deafening\u00a021-shot\u00a0salute.\u00a0The\u00a0Cubans answered with cannon fire from an 18th\u00a0century fortress overlooking the harbor that the Spanish had built to protect the city from pirates. With the frigate came a rescue tug, a fuel ship and the Kazan, an imposing nuclear-powered submarine. Cuba\u2019s Ministry of Defense said that none of the ships were carrying nuclear weapons and that they did not represent \u201ca threat to the region,\u201d clearly meaning the US, Cuba\u2019s neighbor 90 miles to the\u00a0north. But for many Cubans, the visit of the largest convoy of ships in years from their old Cold War ally seemed like a return to the past, particularly as Moscow and Washington increasingly spar over the war in Ukraine. \u201cI never thought I would see a Russian submarine so up close,\u201d said a Cuban man next to me as we waited in line in view of the four\u00a0vessels. We were standing outside the port terminal in Havana which,\u00a0just years earlier,\u00a0had been full\u00a0of\u00a0US cruise ships, until then-President Donald Trump banned their visits to the island\u00a0in 2019. Even though a line had formed, it was not clear if any of us waiting there were going to get aboard. An hour passed in the broiling Cuban sun. \u201cWe are roasting out here,\u201d a woman carrying a small baby next to me said. Cubans are champion line-waiters and I worried that I would have nothing to show for my interlude outside the port other than a worsening sunburn. Finally, a Cuban Navy official in a sparkling white uniform came out to speak to us, resting his hand on my shoulder. \u201cYou can go aboard but need to leave any sharp objects like knives, scissors or hair clippers behind,\u201d he said. Two plainclothes\u00a0state\u00a0security officers began to run everyone\u2019s\u00a0identity card numbers through a database on their phones. I handed my\u00a0carn\u00e9,\u00a0or\u00a0ID card,\u00a0that lists my birthplace in the US to one of the officers who appeared too young to shave. He looked at my\u00a0carn\u00e9\u00a0and turned to his older colleague for advice. \u201cAre we letting foreign residents on board?\u201d\u00a0he asked. The older officer,\u00a0who was wearing a New York Yankee\u2019s baseball cap,\u00a0nodded and then ran my card information through the database. \u201cYou can go ahead,\u201d he said. Inside the port, past officials manning a metal detector, Russian sailors in dark blue unforms waited to take a group of about\u00a020\u00a0of us aboard the Gorshkov. In front of the ship, the sailors had posted a sign in English that declared the Gorshkov\u2019s \u201cmain purpose\u201d was \u201ccombat operations against enemy surface ships and submarines.\u201d The Russian sailors spoke more English than Spanish and I occasionally translated to help the other members of our group, who were\u00a0all\u00a0Cuban. We were told we could film and everyone immediately took out their smartphones to snap videos and selfies. We started out on the ship\u2019s massive helicopter pad and then walked through the ship to the bow. Every few feet a Russian sailor stood keeping watch. At the front of the ship, one of the sailors\u00a0showed me an anti-rocket system\u00a0to be used\u00a0in the unlikely event we came under attack. I asked about the massive cannon and the sailor replied that it could fire shells a distance of 23 kilometers,\u00a0or about 15 miles. A level up, where there appeared to be sensitive communications equipment, a Russian soldier in tactical gear with an assault rifle at his side looked down at us. Just off the bow we could see an unobstructed view of the Kazan, the 430-foot long submarine that stretched out into the harbor. I noticed one of the Russian sailors taking in the blue skies and calm waters around us. \u201cCuba good?\u201d I ask him. \u201cCuba good,\u201d he laughs in reply and gives me a thumbs up. The war in Ukraine has\u00a0severely\u00a0degraded the Russian fleet and once again pitted the US and Russia on opposite sides of a bloody conflict. For a Russian sailor, Cuba could be as good as it gets these days. I disembarked the Russian warship in Havana feeling that the Cold War did not seem like such a distant memory, when I saw an alert flash across my phone. It was an announcement that the Pentagon had just dispatched its own nuclear powered attack submarine\u00a0to the other side of the island:\u00a0the US Navy Base in Guantanamo\u00a0Bay,\u00a0Cuba, slightly more than 500 miles away from the where the Russian ships are docked.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/americas/onboard-the-russian-warship-visiting-cuba/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_19_style_ro-kwon-exhibit-novel-queer-stories", "text": "(CNN) \u2014 Queer love, BDSM sex, identity crises and religious trauma \u2014 they\u2019re not the topics Korean American author R. O. Kwon was raised with; nor are they likely the subjects her family wishes she would write about, she noted wryly. But as she grew into (some of) them, so did they grow into her work: In two novels \u2014 and \u201cKink,\u201d an anthology she co-edited with her fellow author Garth Greenwell \u2014 the Seoul-born, San Francisco-based author has infused her books\u2019 characters and narratives with these themes, in many cases drawn from her own life. Kwon is the first to admit that anxiety relating to the process of writing and self-inquiry plagues her, but such deliberation has not extended to self-censorship in her sexually charged, adventurous protagonists, who are often stuck between the life they think they should live and the life they could. \u201cI have had to learn how to manage my profound anxiety writing \u2014 or, in some cases, not manage very well,\u201d she told CNN in a video interview. \u201cParticularly, the anxiety I feel around writing a book that has so much to do with physical longing. As a Korean woman and as an ex-Catholic\u2026 it feels very dangerous to my body to give any hint in public that I\u2019ve ever had sex. I kept having to walk toward what I was afraid of writing, and to write it.\u201d In \u201cExhibit,\u201d a literary labor of some 9 years, Kwon\u2019s character Jin Han quickly becomes besotted with the mysterious ballerina Lidija, after a chance meeting at a party she\u2019d been attending with her husband, Phillip. In Lidija, Jin finds a twin spirit \u2014 rebellious, artistic and reckless \u2014 and the two begin a sexual, sensory relationship amid struggles in Jin\u2019s marriage. (Phillip has been pressuring Jin to start a family, despite their once mutual desire to remain childless.) \u201cThe book explores what you risk to explore your core desires,\u201d said Kwon. \u201c\u2018Exhibit\u2019 is very interested in varieties of desires \u2014 ambition, the desire to belong, food\u00a0 and sex.\u201d Indulging such desires is the antithesis of the puritanical beliefs inherent in Kwon\u2019s religious upbringing, she explained; the female protagonists in both \u201cExhibit\u201d and her debut novel, \u201cThe Incendiaries,\u201d are likewise plagued with guilt, shame and anxiety over their bodily cravings. Her own loss of faith was like a bankruptcy, Kwon remembered. \u201cI don\u2019t feel I\u2019ve recovered, and I don\u2019t expect to recover,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve come to understand that for some people, there are kinds of grief that don\u2019t ever really end. I think, maybe, I will grieve God with intensity for the rest of my life\u2026 The grief is what I have left of the love I had.\u201d The incisive mining of these inner conflicts and identity crises \u2014 how to exist in a society that expects you to be a God-fearing, family-oriented woman, when such labels no longer apply \u2014 is a throughline fearlessly explored by Kwon across her novels, journalistic work and in her personal life. Kwon is married to her first boyfriend, a man she met in college, and admits many readers will (wrongly) assume that, in \u201cExhibit,\u201d Jin and Phillip are thinly-veiled representations of Kwon and her husband \u2014 who, rather, enjoy a monogamous relationship she describes as \u201cvery loving.\u201d \u201cThe book centers a queer Korean American artist, which I am,\u201d Kwon said. \u201cPeople in my life might think I\u2019ve had an affair with a queer Korean American ballerina. My friend joked that, \u2018Who wouldn\u2019t want to have an affair with a glamorous ballerina?\u2019\u201d Kwon\u2019s own queer sexuality blossomed late. She came out as bisexual to her closest friends, and later on social media, in 2018. In an essay she shared on the subject a year later, she wrote that, \u201cIn part because of my upbringing, it took until years after college for me to understand who and what I\u2019m drawn to, and that my attraction to some people \u2014 including women \u2014 can go beyond the limits of platonic connection.\u201d \u201cI only started talking about being queer in 2018, after \u2018The Incendiaries\u2019 came out,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cGrowing up, I didn\u2019t know anyone who was queer and \u2018out,\u2019 not until I went to college. So, it took a while for me to understand this \u2014 and that\u2019s quite common for people who grow up in Korean American families and communities. Queerness was largely seen as an exotic blight that affects other people.\u201d Tongue-in-cheek, Kwon said she rates her parents\u2019 response to her public outness as a B+. \u201cFor Korean Catholic immigrants, it wasn\u2019t the ideal response, but better than it could have been.\u201d \u201cThere aren\u2019t many Korean American writers who are queer in public,\u201d she continued. \u201cI thought I could add to this number, and that maybe I should if I could. Nobody should ever feel any pressure to be out, but I live in San Francisco and most of my friends are writers and artists. There\u2019s an abundance of queerness in my communities.\u201d Coming out as queer, then, and writing sexually-fuelled, kinky fiction, are Kwon\u2019s means of giving permission and validation to women, like herself, who haven\u2019t seen themselves represented in their communities, nor in art or media. \u201cI wanted to show a world of queer abundance, in which people being queer just is,\u201d said Kwon of \u201cExhibit,\u201d adding that she is writing primarily\u00a0for those who are prepared to hear her, engage with her and recognize themselves \u2014 or the possibility of themselves \u2014 in her work. \u201cEven though we are surrounded by rising fascism and the destabilizing rise of book bans targeting writers of color, queer and trans writers. I wanted to write a book suffused with queer joy and queer plenitude. I\u2019m intensely aware of how threatening it still can be for a lot of people.\u201d Indeed, an invisible threat \u2014 perhaps Kwon\u2019s own self-criticism and anxiety \u2014 lingers, however daring and sexually-charged her fiction is. \u201cPeople must imagine I\u2019m very liberated and yet, I feel so utterly restricted and inhabited in so many ways,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel like such a private person in so many ways. But what I\u2019ve realised is that one doesn\u2019t have to feel liberated to do liberating things, to do things one is afraid of. I hope that\u2019s useful to other people.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/style/ro-kwon-exhibit-novel-queer-stories/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_16_weather_us-fathers-day-heat-wave-climate-sunday", "text": "The year\u2019s most significant heat wave so far is expected to roast a large portion of the central and southern United States on Father\u2019s Day Sunday with potentially record-breaking high temperatures, four days away from summer\u2019s official start. The National Weather Service warned people in the South and Midwest planning to celebrate dads outdoors on Sunday to stay cool amid a major heat risk, with high temperatures into the 90s in some areas. The intense heat wave won\u2019t stop there. An expansive and exceptionally strong heat dome will build Sunday over the East and stretch into the Midwest and Great Lakes over the next few days, with the heat expected to persist through the week. Heat domes trap air in place and bake it with abundant sunshine for days on end, making each day hotter than the last. The final Sunday of spring will be a scorcher in the Plains and Midwest, where temperatures will reach the mid- to upper 90s, according to the Weather Prediction Center. People living across the Great Lakes region can expect temperatures in the upper 80s and low 90s. The Mississippi River Valley will be slammed with the worst of Sunday\u2019s sweltering conditions, with large portions of both states facing a Level 3 \u2013 or major \u2013 risk of heat-related impacts. The National Weather Service office in St. Louis encouraged residents to take extra precautions Sunday for its hottest day of the year. \u201cIt will feel like 100-105 during the afternoon hours. We aren\u2019t used to this kind of heat yet,\u201d forecasters wrote on X, formerly Twitter. Sunday\u2019s unrelenting heat will be felt across states including Kansas, Illinois, Tennessee, Arkansas and Mississippi, according to the weather service. Some smaller pockets of Level 4 \u2013 or extreme \u2013 heat will be felt in a few locations such as Atlanta, where Sunday afternoon temperatures could reach 94 degrees by the afternoon. Millions will face heat-related health risks as conditions reach extreme levels into this week, according to a scale from the National Weather Service and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Heat is the\u00a0deadliest form of weather\u00a0in the US, killing more than twice as many people each year on average as hurricanes and tornadoes combined. Persistent heat could break records this week The extreme temperatures and uncomfortable heat will seep into the larger cities of the Midwest and Northeast by the start of the workweek. On Monday, Chicago temperatures could hit 94 degrees with the heat index at 97 degrees, according to forecasters at Chicago\u2019s weather service office. The high temperatures for the Upper Ohio Valley and Great Lakes regions will soar into the mid- and upper 90s on Monday, with the possibility of tying or breaking numerous records, according to the Weather Prediction Center. The potential for record-shattering heat will last across the Ohio Valley and the Northeast through Friday, with some areas hitting heat indices of 105 degrees, the Weather Prediction Center said. A Level 3 heat risk is expected to affect large portions of states including Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio on Monday, according to the weather service. Meanwhile, much of the southern half of Iowa faces an extreme heat risk on Monday. Weather service forecasters in Des Moines, Iowa, warned of high heat and humidity through Tuesday as temperatures push into the 90s and heat index values hit near-triple digits. \u201cMorning lows will be just as impressive, as temperatures remain in the mid- to even upper 70s,\u201d the Weather Prediction Center said. \u201cThe combination of heat, humidity and little overnight relief will bring potentially widespread, significant heat-related impacts to anyone without adequate hydration or reliable cooling,\u201d according to the center. In Detroit, where daytime temperatures are expected to hit the high 90s, the city\u2019s urban core won\u2019t see much relief after dark, where weather service forecasters say overnight lows will only dip to the 70s this week. The sweltering conditions will continue to shift into the eastern and northeastern US by Tuesday.

Nintendo has racked up over 140 million sales of Zelda since the first edition title hit the shelves in 1986, making it one of the most successful franchises in gaming history and\u00a0delighting generations of fans across multiple consoles. The new game, \u201cThe Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom,\u201d will release on the Switch console on September 26, according to a statement from Nintendo. The many iterations of the games usually revolve around the heroic elf Link, who spends most of his adventures trying to save Princess Zelda who, more often than not, has been kidnapped or mysteriously disappeared. But this latest release will be female-led. \u201cThis time around Link has vanished. Now it\u2019s up to Princess Zelda to step into the protagonist\u2019s role,\u201d Eiji Aonuma, producer of the Zelda series, said in a video released by Nintendo. Gameplay footage released by Nintendo shows \u201cEchoes of Wisdom\u201d looks similar in both style and substance to 2019\u2019s \u201cLink\u2019s Awakening,\u201d the top-down perspective puzzle-based platformer that boasted a cute cartoon design and was itself a reboot of the Game Boy classic from 1993. Zelda teams up with Tri, a mysterious fairy, and together they use magical powers to create echoes, what Nintendo describes as \u201cimitations of things found in the environment.\u201d \u201cRecreate those echoes whenever you like to solve puzzles and defeat enemies,\u201d Nintendo said in its announcement. \u201cUse echoes of water blocks to reach new heights, make bridges out of old beds, throw rocks at foes \u2013 or find your own creative combination of echoes to do things your way,\u201d the company said. The Zelda franchise has long been lauded for entertaining puzzle solving and ground-breaking gameplay that encourages players to both explore at leisure and tackle problems in different ways. Open world gaming has become a major feature of more recent titles with 2017\u2019s \u201cBreath of the Wild\u201d becoming one of Nintendo\u2019s most successful and critically acclaimed titles. The follow-up to that game, last year\u2019s \u201cTears of the Kingdom,\u201d sold 10 million copies in just three days. The release of a new Zelda game is the second surprise announcement Nintendo has dropped in recent weeks. In early May, Nintendo\u2019s president Shuntaro Furukawa\u00a0said the company plans to release a follow-up to its popular Switch console by March 2025. The announcement was welcome news to fans who have been salivating for years over the prospect of a potential successor to the 7-year-old Switch.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/asia/japan-nintendo-new-zelda-announcement-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "world"}}

Jailed for most of the past two decades, Mohammadi was sentenced to a further stretch in prison by authorities who found her guilty of carrying out \u201cpropaganda activities against the regime,\u201d Mostafa Nili, her lawyer, announced on social media. According to Nili, the Iranian regime cited statements Mohammadi made concerning Iranian student and journalist Dina Ghalibaf, who was arrested in April after she publicly claimed to have been sexually assaulted by members of Iran\u2019s morality police. The authorities also cited a letter Mohammadi wrote calling on Iranians to boycott parliamentary elections back in February and the activist\u2019s correspondence with Swedish and Norwegian parliaments. In the past three years, Mohammadi has undergone six trials in revolutionary and criminal courts, resulting\u00a0in a total sentence of 13 years and three months in prison, 154 lashes, exile, and four months of street cleaning, Nili said. Her sentence was most recently extended in January, when she was handed an additional 15 months in prison after being charged with \u201cspreading propaganda\u201d against the Islamic Republic regime, her family said. But incarceration has not impeded Mohammadi\u2019s activism: The 52-year-old recently published a letter calling for an end to the war in Gaza. In the letter, Mohammadi condemned an Israeli strike on a refugee camp in Rafah that killed over 45 Palestinians. From her cell, Mohammadi has also remained committed to amplifying the cause of Iranian women who have staged numerous protests in a bid to resist the regime\u2019s mandatory hijab rule.

{"id": "2024_06_15_europe_germany-first-veterans-day-intl", "text": "Germany is marking its first Veterans\u2019 Day since World War Two on Saturday,\u00a0a once unthinkable move that\u00a0sets\u00a0aside long-standing unease over the honoring of its soldiers. In a sign of the \u201cZeitenwende,\u201d or \u201cchanging of the times,\u201d that Germany is\u00a0undergoing in the wake of the Ukraine war, the country is actively seeking to increase the prestige of its military. Germany has for decades felt uncomfortable over such pageantry given the role of its soldiers in World War II and the Holocaust. But a\u00a0bill to introduce an annual national Veterans\u2019 Day was voted in on April 25 after being approved by nearly all parties in the German parliament. Only the far-left Die Linke party raised objections.\u00a0Party co-chairman Ates G\u00fcrpinar implied this was due to the party\u2019s pacifist stance. \u201cWe on the left reject this Veterans\u2019 Day,\u201d\u00a0he told CNN in a statement.\u00a0\u201cIt is based on cheap symbolic politics and at the same time ensures the minister of defense\u2019s promise of war-readiness.\u201d\u00a0 The new legislation states that the day should be celebrated \u201cpublicly and visibly\u201d every year on June 15.\u00a0It\u00a0also\u00a0mandates improvements to services providing mental and physical care for veterans, including rehabilitation and therapy. The commemorations, modeled on Armed Forces Day in the UK and Veterans Day in the US, will honor all Germans who have worn military uniform \u2013 not only those wounded or killed in combat.\u00a0Germany has around 10 million veterans, according to its ministry of defense.\u00a0 Defense Minister Boris Pistorius described the move as a \u201cstrong, important and, yes, an overdue signal of recognition and appreciation.\u201d During the Cold War, Soviet-occupied East Germany celebrated its National People\u2019s Army with military parades. An equivalent was never established in the West. Following the end of World War II,\u00a0the first combat mission in which\u00a0German soldiers took part was the Kosovo War in the late 1990s.\u00a0Since then\u00a0the most significant deployments of\u00a0the\u00a0German armed forces, or Bundeswehr,\u00a0have been in Afghanistan and Mali. But the biggest spur to creating a Veterans\u2019\u00a0Day has been Ukraine. Germany was initially reluctant to send heavy weaponry to Kyiv for fear of becoming directly involved in the war, but eventually bowed to international pressure. Now, Berlin is the second-biggest supplier of military aid to Ukraine. \u201cThe war against Ukraine has created the need for a significant build-up of the Bundeswehr (armed forces), increased spending and also recruitment,\u201d Johannes Kiess, a sociologist at the University of Leipzig, told CNN.\u00a0It was\u00a0an opportunity, he\u00a0added,\u00a0that made it appear appropriate to upgrade the military \u201csymbolically\u201d as well. A relationship of respect This Saturday, the day will be marked with an event in Berlin. From next year, commemorations will take place nationwide. Johannes Arlt, a former soldier who was deployed four times to Afghanistan and three times to Mali from 2014 to 2019, is now a lawmaker for the ruling center-left Social Democrats (SPD). He played a prominent role in forming the new Veterans\u2019\u00a0Day bill. Speaking to CNN, Arlt said he\u00a0experienced first-hand the lack of recognition of the Bundeswehr in German society, particularly for deployments abroad, but acknowledged that this appears to have changed in recent times. \u201cFor a long time, there appeared to be a sparse interest in people who served abroad, and there used to be little empathy, but we find that the population now has a great deal of respect for the Bundeswehr.\u201d Arlt explains he believes a Veterans\u2019\u00a0Day in Germany is important to \u201ccommemorate military service \u2013 in all its facets \u2013 and thank the men and women who are committed to security in our country.\u201d Arlt said he experienced horrors during his military service abroad that he would not wish anyone to witness. \u201cI had my worst experiences in Mali in 2019,\u201d he said. \u201cI flew a drone and saw all the things that others didn\u2019t see on the front line. I was also present at massacres and had to watch these things and couldn\u2019t do anything. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t wish that on anyone.\u201d Mental health support leaves \u2018room for improvement\u2019 Part of the reason for the move is to improve the health services offered to soldiers returning from assignments overseas, as well as\u00a0to\u00a0raise awareness of what they have to endure. Army veteran Andreas Eggert served in the Bundeswehr from 1999-2013, first in Kosovo and then in Afghanistan. He was diagnosed with PTSD in 2013 and went into rehabilitation in 2014. He is welcoming the efforts to improve aftercare for soldiers, many of whom are left with physical or psychological damage. \u201cMental illness was still frowned upon in my time, especially if you were in a specialized assignment like I was, it was difficult to deal with it openly,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cBut I did it back then, in 2013, I spoke out it openly and was criticized a lot for it.\u201d Eggert says that he has seen the Bundeswehr\u2019s rehabilitation programs improve over the years, but there is still work to be done. \u201c[The programs] are not optimal, and the care is not optimal either. There are not enough therapists, especially not in the Bundeswehr. The Bundeswehr hospitals that do a good job are often overstretched\u2026 There is a lot of room for improvement.\u201d Regardless of the debate around marking Veterans\u2019 Day,\u00a0it is clear the country has had to adapt its anti-militaristic stance in recent years. Pistorius has previously warned that Germany needs to prepare for a worst-case scenario regarding the specter\u00a0of war in Europe. He has also not ruled out introducing some form of military conscription. For now, though, the soldiers CNN spoke to were simply grateful for the acknowledgment. \u201cI don\u2019t see myself as a hero, quite the opposite, but what I have missed is a time or even a day when we can also remember those who have fallen during their assignments,\u201d\u00a0said 42-year-old Stefan Huss, an active soldier who twice served in Afghanistan. He added: \u201cWe have been fighting for this for a long time.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/15/europe/germany-first-veterans-day-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_15_europe_ukraine-peace-summit-switzerland-intl", "text": "More than 100 countries and organizations have gathered for a major conference in Switzerland dedicated to setting out a path toward peace between Ukraine and Russia, but there will be no delegation from Moscow. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is aiming to use the meeting, which is being held at a resort near Lucerne, to drum up support for the 10-point peace plan he first outlined late in 2022. Addressing the conference on Saturday, Zelensky said the proposal for ending the war would be submitted to Russia once it had been agreed by the other nations in attendance and there would then be a second peace summit, where \u201cwe can fix the real end of the war.\u201d \u201cThe peace formula is inclusive, and we are happy to hear and work on all proposals, all ideas of what is really needed for peace and what is important to you dear friends,\u201d Zelensky said. \u201cI urge you to be as active as possible and I am proud all parts of the world, all continents are now represented at the peace summit,\u201d he added. Most Western governments have sent representatives at a senior level. US Vice President Kamala Harris is attending and announced that Washington will supply Kyiv with an aid package of more than $1.5 billion to help the country rebuild its battered infrastructure and address humanitarian needs stemming from the conflict,\u00a0according to a statement from the White House on Saturday. \u201cThis war remains an utter failure for Putin. I am here in Switzerland to stand with Ukraine and the leaders from around the world in support of a just and lasting peace,\u201d Harris said. Heads of state and government from several European states, including France, Germany and the UK are also joining, as is Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. However, China will not attend. It has said that any such meeting needs to be attended by both Russia and Ukraine. Zelensky\u2019s plan includes demands for a cessation of hostilites, the restoration of Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity, the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukrainian soil and the restoration of Ukraine\u2019s \ufeffpre-war borders with Russia. It also calls for the establishment of a special tribunal to prosecute Russian war crimes. \u201cUkraine never wanted this war, it\u2019s a criminal and absolutely unprovoked aggression of Russia. And the only one who wanted it was Putin,\u201d Zelensky said. Russia has expressed little interest in agreeing to those terms and has shown no sign of compromise when it comes to the territorial issues. On Friday, the day before the summit was set to kick off, Russian President Vladimir Putin restated the Kremlin\u2019s own peace plan, which Ukraine is unlikely to ever agree to. The proposal calls for Ukrainian troops withdraw from four southern and eastern regions of Ukrainian territory that Moscow said it would annex in violation of international law and demands Kyiv abandon its bid to join\u00a0NATO. While Russian forces have made modest gains in two of the regions \u2013 Donetsk and Luhansk \u2013 in recent months, they are far from occupying all four, which include Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. Putin said later in the day that nearly 700,000 Russian soldiers are fighting in Ukraine, a hike from the 617,000 he reported during a end-of-year press conference in 2023.

The purpose of the permits is to fundamentally integrate those guardians into Colombian society, allowing them to seek employment and access services provided by the government, director of Migration Colombia Fernando Garc\u00eda said at a press conference. \u201cThis is an instrument that will allow us to regularize the legal representatives or custodians of more than 270,000 Venezuelan children and adolescents. They will be able to access a Colombian identification document that will allow them, among other things, to access the social and financial services of the State, especially what has to do with health and education services for both minors and adults,\u201d Garc\u00eda said. The permit also seeks to reinforce the protection of Venezuelan migrant minors, according to Sol\u00e1ngel Ortiz, director of Immigration, Consular Affairs and Citizen Services of the Colombian Foreign Ministry. \u201cAlthough this measure will cover the guardians of children and adolescents who already have a special permit, the precise purpose is to protect children and adolescents with this differential approach, because a boy, a girl who is in school, who does not have their parent, whose parent is not regular, can be the object of many forms of violence,\u201d she said. In recent years, Colombia has become the main destination for Venezuelan migrants in South America. An estimated 2.5 million Venezuelans lived in Colombia in 2023, according to Migration Colombia.

{"id": "world_africa_adekunle-gold-sickle-cell-disease-awareness-nigeria-spc", "text": "Award-winning Nigerian singer Adekunle Gold rose to international fame when his debut album \u201cGold\u201d reached number seven on the Billboard World Charts. Since then, the 37-year-old has released four more albums, amassing hundreds of millions of streams worldwide. Behind the scenes, however, he has been quietly battling sickle cell disease, an inherited blood disorder that leads to abnormally shaped red blood cells, causing severe pain, anemia, and potentially life-threatening complications. It affects children who inherit two copies of the sickle cell gene, one from each parent. The disease is most prevalent in Africa, which accounts for 66% of cases worldwide, according to the World Health Organization. Nigeria bears the highest burden, where as many as 150,000 babies are born with sickle cell disease annually \u2013 the most of any country. Adekunle Gold first wrote of his woes with sickle cell disease in 2022 in his song \u201c5 Star.\u201d Now, he is readying himself for a long-term commitment to advocacy, announcing the establishment of the Adekunle Gold Foundation, which will focus on addressing the needs of children battling sickle cell disease on the African continent. Recently, the singer sat down with CNN\u2019s Larry Madowo for his first in-depth interview about living with sickle cell. This interview has been lightly edited for clarity and length. Larry Madowo: Why are you speaking up about sickle cell disease now and especially being very aggressive about this awareness? Adekunle Gold: I just really got the courage to come out and speak about it. You know, a lot of people can\u2019t share their stories like I can. I was writing the song \u201c5 Star\u201d and reflecting on my life, the journey, and how I\u2019m a miracle. I was reflecting on that song, and I thought, maybe it\u2019s time to learn my voice. People are dying, people are going through it. People can\u2019t afford basic things that they need to sustain their health, and if the international organizations are not doing anything about it, it\u2019s time to force their hands to do it. Larry Madowo: What challenges have you had to overcome while living with sickle cell? Adekunle Gold: I constantly put myself in situations that made me sick as a child. For example, doing strenuous activities as a child that I was not supposed to do and there were always consequences, you know? But I always knew that I didn\u2019t want this thing to define me. So, if it means that I need to exercise more, take my drugs, eat well, rest well, and take more water, then I need to do that always. Larry Madowo: Are there any memorable things that you\u2019ve come through during your advocacy work when people are not even aware of what they\u2019re facing? Adekunle Gold: Just speaking up about it on social, I realized that a lot of people are ignorant about it. This is something that I inherited, and you\u2019re trolling me for it. So, you realize people don\u2019t even know these things. I just need more people to be aware. Larry Madowo: What are some of the barriers to receiving proper care for sickle cell patients in West Africa? In Nigeria? Adekunle Gold: Listen, people don\u2019t have money, bro. The last outreach I did people came to Lagos to take drugs, to check their BP (blood pressure), to check their children all the way from Ilorin [300 kilometers away from Lagos]. And I\u2019m like, this is insane. We don\u2019t have facilities where you can just be in your place. Other countries like the UK and Canada have policies for sickle cell. Where it affects us the most, we don\u2019t have (accessible care). People can\u2019t afford to buy folic acid and folic acid is the smallest of things that you should be able to get. Larry Madowo: What do you hope to achieve by adding your voice to this, by speaking up publicly? Adekunle Gold: I want everybody to, first of all, be aware of it and know how to treat people that have it.\u00a0 I also want people to understand that it is important to check your genotype. Larry Madowo: You\u2019re the embodiment that you can live with sickle cell and have a full, healthy, and powerful life. Will you keep talking about this in your music and your public appearances with your shows? Adekunle Gold: I started the foundation, so you know it\u2019s real. It\u2019s game time from now on. So, I am constantly learning my voice, constantly doing outreach, and constantly fighting for it. I want the international community to pay attention just like they do to other diseases. Sickle cell is a big one. It affects my people the most, and I want the world to do something about it.

{"id": "2024_06_13_style_lagos-fashion-lgbtq-inclusivity", "text": "Since its inception in 2011,\u00a0Lagos\u00a0Fashion Week has been a twice-yearly highlight of the African fashion calendar, a multi-day\u00a0showcase attracting the continent\u2019s top design\u00a0houses, big name sponsors, as well as an international audience. In a deeply religious and conservative Nigeria,\u00a0where\u00a0LGBTQ\u00a0people suffer extremely high\u00a0levels of homophobia, intolerance, and even violence,\u00a0Lagos\u00a0Fashion Week quickly established itself as an inclusive space for marginalized communities and unconventional brands to be seen and heard. For more than a decade, Nigerian label Orange Culture has staged catwalk shows featuring male models in skirts, makeup, or wearing ribbons down the runway as a way of provoking conversations about how fashion can be used to break down gender norms. Maxivive \u2014\u00a0which\u00a0describes\u00a0itself\u00a0as \u201ca\u00a0Lagos-based fashion organization founded\u2026 on ideas of nonconformity and the subversion of norms\u201d \u2014\u00a0has\u00a0also made waves showcasing graphic, gender-bending pieces addressing issues around sexuality and identity over consecutive seasons. Over the past few years however, members of the\u00a0LGBTQ community\u00a0in Nigeria say\u00a0Lagos\u00a0Fashion Week\u2019s inclusive stance has come under pressure amidst a growing culture of hostility towards non-binary and gay people in the country. In 2014, despite widespread international condemnation, Nigeria \u2014 Africa\u2019s most populous nation \u2014\u00a0adopted the SSMPA law (Same Sex Marriage Prohibition Act)\u00a0which bans gay marriage, same-sex relationships and membership of gay rights groups with punishments including a prison term of up to 14 years for those convicted. Gay\u00a0rights\u00a0activists say these sentiments are filtering down into what was one of Nigeria\u2019s most open-minded industries: Fashion. Kayode Timileyin is the founder of Queercity Media and Production, one of the leading non- governmental\u00a0queer organizations in Nigeria as well as being the festival manager for\u00a0Lagos\u00a0Pride, a week-long celebration in June to commemorate Pride month in Nigeria. \u201cThere is a history of anti-queerness when it comes to fashion week in Nigeria,\u201d he told CNN. Activists point to the city\u2019s Spring-Summer 2022 showcase, featuring the late Fola Francis \u2014 the first-ever transgender person\u00a0to be cast by labels to model on the city\u2019s catwalk.\u00a0 Francis tragically drowned in December 2023. While her debut was hailed as a watershed moment in both African fashion and for the queer community at large (she walked twice, for labels Cute-Saint and Fruch\u00e9), it also sparked controversy. At the time, Francis said she faced a public backlash from some sections of Nigerian society\u00a0and pointed out that despite her boundary-breaking appearances, no images of her were posted on\u00a0Lagos\u00a0Fashion Week\u2019s social media accounts.\u00a0In\u00a0an interview with digital LGBTQ magazine Xtra\u00a0shortly after the event in November 2022, Francis said \u201cI heard the\u00a0Lagos Fashion Week\u2019s team decided not to post any of my pictures from the runway or include (them) in any press releases. Why am I not surprised?\u201d (The magazine said they approached\u00a0Lagos\u00a0Fashion Week at the time, who did not respond to their requests for comment.) After casting non-binary models to walk on its catwalk during the Spring-Summer 2023 shows, subversive fashion house Maxivive had its show cancelled by organizers just days before it was meant to go ahead. While brand founder Papa Oyeyemi told CNN he would prefer not to talk about the cancellation, discussion within the industry centered around the presentation having been deemed \u201ctoo gay\u201d by organizers. \u201cFor the presentation to get cancelled at the last minute was very disheartening,\u201d one non-binary model booked to walk for Maxivive told CNN (they wished to remain anonymous for their safety). \u201cQueer people exist in Nigeria and fashion is meant to be expressive, not restrictive.\u201d Tosin Ogundadegbe, a Lagos-based fashion stylist\u00a0known as \u201cThe Style Infidel\u201d on social\u00a0media said that the fashion industry in Nigeria still has a long way to go when it comes to\u00a0inclusivity. \u201cThe traditional fashion schedule suffers from (a lack of) inclusivity on the runway \u2014 we only see representation of marginalized communities at private shows.\u201d Finding the freedom to be who you are Indeed, amid what\u2019s perceived as a growing pressure for organizers to adhere to anti-gay laws and increasingly divisive politics around gender, sexuality and inclusivity in Nigeria, an increasing number of fashion labels have chosen to show \u201coff-schedule\u201d via \u201cunderground\u201d private presentations where they feel they can be more free to embody the ethos of their brands, rather than in the glare of\u00a0Lagos\u00a0Fashion Week. From labels such as\u00a0Tzar Studios,\u00a0a \u201cvisually provocative contemporary menswear brand\u2026 inspired by the ethos of the metrosexual man,\u201d to\u00a0ready-to-wear brand\u00a0Weiz Dhurm Franklyn, these\u00a0clandestine, \u201cinvite only\u201d shows are curated by designers who keep locations discreet and hand-pick trusted journalists, influencers, celebrities and fashion industry figures to sit in the audience. Udiahgebi, a fashion brand known for its androgynous pieces, has successfully hosted private shows in this way. The house\u00a0cast five non-binary models to walk in its first-ever runway show in 2022 to a positive reception, brand creative director Chiemerie Udiahgebi Ugwoke told CNN. \u201cThe feedback after my show was\u00a0alarmingly good,\u201d they wrote over email. \u201cI was not expecting positive reviews from the attendees because\u2026 I took gender-neutral clothes (featuring see-through fabrics, animal prints and cut-outs) and played with them in a way I felt was more likely to attract negative reviews\u00a0considering the society we live in.\u201d Aso Nigeria, another androgynous and inclusive fashion label, cast Fola Francis in both its\u00a0private runway show in December 2022\u00a0and a fashion advertising campaign released in February 2024.\u00a0Brand founder\u00a0Aanuoluwa Ajide-Daniels told CNN that including a trans woman was \u201cessential to the idea of the brand, and something that will be seen throughout the lifespan of Aso.\u201d \u201cI see fashion as art, it is meant to start a conversation and also provoke thought,\u201d said Kayode Timileyin. \u201cHowever, over the years, (Lagos) Fashion Week continues to hush down and limit these conversations.\u201d\u00a0While championing an inclusive future for the artists and fashion designers of Africa cannot solely be done behind closed doors; for now, many designers believe it is the only \u2014 and an essential \u2014 way to be able to freely express who they are.

{"id": "2024_06_17_middleeast_israel-plans-tactical-pause-gaza-what-we-know-mime-intl", "text": "The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has announced a \u201ctactical pause\u201d of military activities along a road in southern Gaza that has been designated for humanitarian aid deliveries every day for 11 hours. The announcement comes as the strip\u2019s population of more than 2 million grapples with humanitarian conditions that the United Nations has described as \u201cunspeakable.\u201d The war, which began on October 7 in the wake of Hamas\u2019 attack on Israel that killed around 1,200 people and captured 250 hostages, is now in its ninth month with no indication of a ceasefire-hostage deal in the immediate future. The fighting has killed more than 37,000 people so far in Gaza, according to the health ministry in the enclave. On Saturday, eight Israeli soldiers were killed in southern Gaza in one of the deadliest single incidents since the war began. More than 300 IDF soldiers have died to date. The \u201cpause,\u201d which the IDF announced Sunday but COGAT, the Israeli agency responsible for approving aid into Gaza, said came into effect on Saturday, raised questions about what it means for the conflict and for the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Human rights groups have described health concerns \u201cbeyond crisis levels\u201d\u00a0for Palestinians in the enclave, with over 75% of the population displaced, according to the UN\u2019s agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA). Israel\u2019s military campaign has pulverized neighborhoods, damaged health infrastructure and depleted food, water and fuel supplies. The announcement also appeared to have deepened existing political rifts in the Israeli government, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu unhappy when he first heard about it, according to one official. Here\u2019s what we know. What did Israel announce? The IDF announced that a \u201clocal, tactical pause of military activity for humanitarian purposes\u201d will take place every day from 8 a.m. until 7 p.m. local time until further notice. The pause began Saturday, the IDF said, and is meant to allow trucks to move from the Kerem Shalom Crossing, the main entry point for incoming aid to southern Gaza, up the Salah al-Din Road and northwards. The IDF has designated a specific route for aid trucks to take, which starts from Kerem Shalom to Al Bayuk neighborhood and onto the European Hospital in Khan Younis. The route will be run in coordination with international organizations, the IDF said, as part of efforts to increase volumes of aid reaching Gaza. Soon after announcing the move, the IDF said \u201cthe fighting in Rafah continues,\u201d adding that \u201cthere is no change\u201d in the country\u2019s policy on aid into the strip. In response to a question by CNN\u2019s Paula Hancocks during a briefing to international media in Kerem Shalom on Monday, Israeli military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said that \u201csometimes when you say a tactical pause, people might think that we\u2019re stopping the fighting in Gaza.\u201d \u201cWe should\u2019ve clarified better that we are fighting in Gaza, that we are fighting in Rafah and we created this safe pass, in those hours, to make sure the distribution (of aid) is ongoing,\u201d Hagari said. What will it mean in practice? The IDF said the \u201chumanitarian pause\u201d is meant to help the UN collect and distribute aid at its crossings, where Israel has said aid is\u00a0piling up. COGAT said on Sunday that there are 1,000 humanitarian aid trucks on the Gazan side of the Kerem Shalom crossing waiting to be collected and distributed. Georgios Petropoulos, head of the UN humanitarian affairs (UNOCHA) suboffice in Gaza, told CNN on Monday the pause \u201cwas not a new thing on the ground,\u201d and that there are a number of issues preventing aid workers from reaching parts of the Palestinian enclave. These include the fighting between Israel and Hamas, but also the danger that exists on travel routes as many parts of Gaza battle a state of lawlessness \u2013 where there is \u201ca lack of any police or rule of law,\u201d Petropoulos said. The pause is \u201csimply a packaging of an announcement reflecting what we have been doing here in Gaza for over a week,\u201d Petropoulos told CNN, adding that \u201cthat road was being used by the UN to move goods for days.\u201d When roads are dangerous, aid trucks cannot travel up them, he said. \u201cThe war between Hamas and Israel is not the only issue we have on the ground.\u201d It is unclear how effective the pause will be, as the IDF has previously designated other routes as safe paths for aid, only for aid convoys to be struck. In April, the deadly Israeli attack that killed seven aid workers from the non-profit World Central Kitchen (WCK) in Gaza hit what the team said was a \u201cdeconflicted zone\u201d in coordination with the Israeli military. Aid groups are saying that no difference has yet been seen on the ground. \u201cWe have not seen any improvements thus far,\u201d said Scott Anderson, director of UNRWA affairs in Gaza, stressing that \u201cthe law and order environment in Gaza is not enabling the efficient delivery of aid.\u201d The spokesperson for the UN Children\u2019s Fund, James Elder, warned the pause could not replace a ceasefire. \u201cI just don\u2019t know unfortunately (how long the pause will last), this is a question for the occupying power, for Israel and its military.\u201d What\u2019s the aid situation like in Gaza now? The more than eight-month long humanitarian crisis in Gaza is spiraling. Thousands have died in the besieged enclave, according to the health ministry there, and more than half the population has been internally displaced. Gazans are facing desperate levels of hunger, with more than 50,000 children in need of treatment for acute malnutrition, UNRWA said. Hospitals are in ruins, medical supplies are scarce and humanitarian access remains limited, the UN agency added. According to UNRWA\u2019s data, 60 trucks entered Gaza on June 12, the last batch of vehicles the UN agency has recorded. Land crossings, which aid groups say are the most effective way of getting aid into Gaza, remain limited. Out of five land crossings, only two have been open for aid trucks recently. Those are the Israeli-controlled Kerem Shalom and Western Erez crossings. A humanitarian pier\u00a0constructed by the US military off the coast of Gaza has also shuttered due to heavy seas, hampering maritime aid delivery. The Government Media Office (GMO) in Gaza has denied that a \u201ctactical pause\u201d is now in effect in the southern Gaza Strip. \u201cTalking about a tactical cessation of the war is an Israeli lie,\u201d the GMO said in a statement Sunday. \u201cWe are still demanding the opening of the Rafah crossing to meet the needs of the population, especially in the northern Gaza Strip.\u201d What has the Israeli government said? It is unclear who took the decision for the pause, as several senior Israeli officials seemed to have been kept in the dark ahead of the announcement. This includes the prime minister, who initially disowned the pause. According to one Israeli official, Netanyahu has raised the question of who ordered it and was unhappy when he first heard about it. The prime minister then contacted his military secretary and said the idea was unacceptable until he was assured the fighting in Rafah would continue, said the official who spoke to CNN on Sunday and requested anonymity. Far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir also condemned the pause. \u201cWhoever decided on a \u2018tactical pause\u2019 for the purpose of a humanitarian transition, especially at a time when the best of our soldiers are falling in battle, is evil and a fool who should not continue to be in his position,\u201d he said. These disagreements, which burst out into the open across statements and in Israeli media, have only deepened rifts in the country\u2019s government. An IDF spokesman said Monday the pause had been approved by Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant. He said this kind of decision would first be made by COGAT and the Southern Command, and then go up the chain of command for approval, depending on the situation. When asked if this kind of decision would need approval from the Israeli government or cabinet, the spokesperson said, \u201cthis kind of decision does not necessarily need to be approved by the cabinet, and it was approved by the minister of defense.\u201d In an earlier statement Monday the IDF had said the decision was made by the military, not by the Israeli government. The announcement of the pause came \u201cafter the request of the political echelon of the IDF in recent weeks to allow the introduction of aid, and to announce this to the world,\u201d the military told CNN in a statement. The pause is meant to meet the demands of the International Court of Justice regarding Gaza aid deliveries ahead of a court hearing by the end of June, it added. The pause is \u201cintended for the hearing\u2026 at the International Court of Justice in The Hague, where Israel will have to prove that it did not violate the order it issued regarding the fighting in Rafah,\u201d which prevented a court order to stop the war, the IDF said. The ICJ is investigating a case brought by Pretoria against Israel in which South Africa accuses Israel of committing genocide against Palestinians during the war. In May, it ordered Israel to immediately halt its controversial military operation in Rafah, saying the court considers the humanitarian situation in the southern city to be classified as \u201cdisastrous.\u201d Israeli officials condemned the ICJ\u2019s ruling.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/middleeast/israel-plans-tactical-pause-gaza-what-we-know-mime-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_02_style_aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl", "text": "Miami has a new addition to its skyline \u2013 a 66-story residential tower built by Aston Martin, marking the British luxury sports carmaker\u2019s first foray into the residential real estate market. Comprising of 391 units, Aston Martin Residences Miami sits at the mouth of the Miami River on Biscayne Bay, the firm said in a statement Tuesday. Designed in partnership with architect Rodolfo Miani of Bodas Mian Anger and built by G&G Business Developments, the 249-meter- (818-foot-) tall building houses seven penthouses, each with private pools and terraces, as well as apartments ranging in size from one to five bedrooms. The largest unit is the \u201cUnique Triplex Penthouse,\u201d arranged over three floors at the top of the building, which remains on the market for $59 million. The property was officially opened on Tuesday. Timed to coincide with the Formula One Miami Grand Prix, the company said in a statement that it marks \u201cthe latest distinct expression of Aston Martin\u2019s ultra-luxury high performance brand.\u201d Featuring an infinity pool with a pool deck, jacuzzis and cabanas on the 55th floor, the sail-shaped complex has a two-floor fitness center, two movie theaters and a virtual golf simulator. The building has a sky bar and lounge, chef\u2019s kitchen, ballroom and private dining areas, as well as a spa, beauty salon and barber shop. Direct access to the sea via a superyacht marina is also available, plus a private butler service. Germ\u00e1n Coto, chief executive officer of G&G Business Developments, told CNN Tuesday that the firm wanted to work on a project in the \u201ccosmopolitan city\u201d of Miami, and that this piece of land was the perfect choice. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing plot with an excellent view of the river,\u201d said Coto. The structure\u2019s aerodynamic shape helps the building deal with the technical challenges presented by high winds in the area, as well as evoking the sleek shape of an Aston Martin, according to Marek Reichman, executive vice president and chief creative officer of Aston Martin. It also becomes wider from the base to the mid-section before tightening once more towards the top, making it appear to bow out over people on street level, Reichman told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the drama,\u201d he added. Challenges However, the process wasn\u2019t all plain sailing. \u201cIt was difficult to achieve what we wanted because the space and the plot is kind of small,\u201d said Coto, with the building fitting into a 1.25-acre plot of land. Meanwhile, local building regulations imposed strict standards, explained Reichman, taking into account the low-lying land and propensity for flooding. \u201cThey were some of the most amazing challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to withstand the flooding with the windows that are on street level.\u201d There were further obstacles due to the curved shape of the building, which means that units on the east side have an individual architectural structural component. Aston Martin touches Homeowners are able to customize their interior space with the help of the Aston Martin design team, with three style packages \u2013 Timeless, Covert and Indulgent \u2013 drawing on the company\u2019s British heritage, as well as the building\u2019s context. \u201cIt needs to have part of the DNA of an Aston Martin,\u201d Reichman said. \u201cBut we are in Miami, you don\u2019t have a cold November evening where you need to put the log fire on, so you\u2019ve got to be considerate of the environment that you\u2019re in.\u201d Design elements running through the building include doors with bespoke Aston Martin handles, number plinths and kestrel tan leather door tabs. Aston Martin said that 99% of the properties sold before the building was completed. Residences were sold for $1.5 million to $8.5 million, while penthouses ranged from $16 million to $59 million. The Unique Triplex Penthouse, on the market for $59 million, comes with the last remaining Aston Martin Vulcan, an 820 brake horsepower all-carbon fiber supercar, of which only 24 exist, a spokesman for the company said. Meanwhile, buyers of the 47 Signature and Penthouse units were also able to choose between an Aston Martin DBX sports SUV or the company\u2019s DB11 sportscar. Aston Martin isn\u2019t the first luxury carmaker to enter the residential property market. A 63-story building from Bentley will open in 2026 along the coastline of Sunny Isles Beach, Florida. Featuring 216 units, the property will have an elevator designed to take residents up to their doorstep while seated inside their cars.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/02/style/aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "world"}}

The MV Tutor is thought to be the second ship sunk by Houthis since March, when the British-registered vessel Rubymar was downed after being struck by ballistic missiles fired from Houthi territory in Yemen. The rebels have launched dozens of missile and drone attacks directed at ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden since Israel launched its invasion of Gaza following the Hamas-led October 7\u00a0attacks. Since then, tensions have spiked across the Middle East, with key regional actors fiercely condemning the humanitarian crisis caused by more than eight months of Israeli bombardment of Gaza. Israel launched its military offensive\u00a0in October\u00a0after militants led by Hamas, which governs Gaza, killed at least 1,200 people and abducted more than 250 others. Israeli attacks\u00a0in\u00a0Gaza have since killed at least\u00a037,396\u00a0Palestinians and injured another\u00a085,523\u00a0people, according to the Ministry of Health there. The Tutor was first hit on June 12 by a smaller boat before being struck a second time by \u201can unknown airborne projectile,\u201d according to the UKMTO. One crew member was reported missing after the attack, US Central Command (CENTCOM) said last week. After the ship\u2019s entire crew were evacuated from the vessel, it began to drift before reportedly sinking on Tuesday, according to the UKMTO. A Houthi spokesperson previously claimed that the ship had been attacked by a\u00a0sea\u00a0drone, ballistic missiles and other drones for violating their so-called \u201cban to the occupied Palestinian ports.\u201d Houthi-run news outlet Al Masirah acknowledged foreign media reports regarding the sinking on Tuesday. Meanwhile, CENTCOM said on X that, \u201cThe Houthis claim to be acting on behalf of Palestinians in Gaza and yet they are targeting and threatening the lives of third country nationals who have nothing to do with the conflict in Gaza. The ongoing threat to international commerce caused by the Houthis in fact makes it harder to deliver badly needed assistance to the people of Yemen as well as Gaza.\u201d Earlier this month, CENTCOM launched attacks on Houthi radars that helped facilitate the group\u2019s ongoing assaults on ships in the Red Sea, according to US Central Command.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/middleeast/houthi-rebels-red-sea-attacks-mv-tutor-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_04_10_style_graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers", "text": "Climbing up abandoned, unfinished floors and tightrope walking across balcony ledges, backpacks clanging with cans of alkyd and acrylic, a collective of Los Angeles graffiti artists have transformed their craft beyond urban aesthetics to champion community issues. Their choice of canvas: Oceanwide Plaza in Downtown LA. Occupying over a full square city block, the plaza was imagined as a vast mixed-use building project, offering city residents over 500 lavish condominiums, a five-star hotel, retail spaces, restaurants and a private 2-acre park. However, construction on the $1 billion project, which began in 2015, was shelved after the Chinese-backed contractor Oceanwide Holdings ran out of funding\u00a0in 2019 \u2014 and it has lain unfinished ever since. The plaza\u2019s status \u2014 and potential \u2014 as an eye-catching venue for their work spread by word of mouth within the graffiti community in recent months. Security at the site was known to be lax, an important detail as accessing the plaza\u2019s towers and other buildings constitutes trespassing. (The Los Angeles City Attorney confirmed to CNN that, as of April 3, criminal charges have been filed against 23 individuals, for violations including trespassing and possession of vandalism tools.) \u201cIt was like a gift from the graffiti gods\u2026 A giant canvas in the middle of downtown,\u201d tagger ENDEM told CNN, speaking on behalf of himself and his graffiti crew, NCT. \u201cWe were like, \u2018Let\u2019s do it right. Let\u2019s do it as if the whole world is going to see this.\u2019\u201d Historically, graffiti has often been used as protest art. While the practice dates back thousands of years, it\u2019s most commonly viewed in a contemporary context (within graffiti\u2019s \u201cmodern\u201d era, which dates back to the 1960s and 70s) as a creative vehicle for challenging societal norms and inequities \u2014 whether on the Berlin Wall in Germany or subway cars in New York City; whether painted by anonymous artists or well-known figures like Keith Haring or Banksy, even if the latter is, technically, anonymous himself. Still, neither ENDEM nor any of the other artists involved realized how famous their work on the Oceanside towers would become. Sharing his artwork on Instagram on January 31, a video from ENDEM quickly racked up tens of thousands of views: Vibrant images of bright block lettering splayed across the building\u2019s exterior paired with footage from the inside \u2014 the artist posing with shots of his spray paint cans, poised above the cityscape. The viral footage, among other visuals shared on social media, quickly opened the floodgates. Hitting Oceanside became a mark of credibility in the graffiti world; by mid-February, the number of tags and other graffiti pieces there were multiplying overnight. \u201cIt was an open house people going in and out. It was beautiful. It was like graffiti paradise,\u201d ENDEM said. \u201cIt felt exactly like the streets, but concentrated.\u201d Transformed in part into an art installation, Oceanwide became an opportunity for the graffiti artists to leave a message to the city below, and a call-out to policy makers who leave buildings to rot. \u201cGraffiti shows you where the city hurts,\u201d Roger Gastman, owner and founder of the LA-based arts organization Beyond the Streets, told CNN. Renowned for its large-scale exhibitions, immersive educational programs, pop-up events and partnerships, Beyond the Streets works to educate and celebrate the diverse dimensions of graffiti as a medium. To him, the mission of graffiti is clear: to challenge, educate, and redefine public perception of the medium. Earl Ofari Hutchinson, president of The Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable, a nonpartisan public policy forum\u00a0for civic participation and education,\u00a0sees the abandoned towers as amplifying the social issues of the community they are situated in, connecting the graffiti-laden structures to the urban blight that surrounds them in LA\u2019s Skid Row. Skid Row is a 50-block sector of downtown LA where between 8,000 and 11,000 unhoused people live in challenging, often squalid conditions. \u201cYou\u2019ve got tens of thousands of people displaced because of over urban development. And as a result of that, they\u2019re on the streets,\u201d Hutchinson told CNN, noting that the homeless population in Los Angeles is continuing to grow. (The Los Angeles Housing Services Authority reports a 9% increase in homelessness in LA county in 2023 and a 10% increase in the city from 2022.) \u201cNow, set right in the middle of that, you have\u2026 a development that will never be completed.\u201d \u201cWhat you have here is a classic urban nightmare brought on by very poor policies \u2014 fiscal, financial, budgetary and political problems (in) a city that has just gone off the rails in terms of over-development and lack of affordability,\u201d Hutchinson added. Still, Hutchinson is no fan of the graffiti either. To him, and many other LA residents who have said they disapprove of the \u201cvandalism,\u201d the plaza is a sore sight for eyes. \u201cThe problem is you\u2019re talking about violating public space and with no permission\u2026 that doesn\u2019t fly with me,\u201d Hutchinson said. \u201cThe fact of the matter is, the public has not given you approval. (And) the general public has to pay for the removal.\u201d Costs currently borne by the taxpayer at the Oceanwide Plaza site include the security details provided by the LAPD as well as the graffiti cleanup Hutchinson highlights. (\u201cThis has strained our deployment,\u201d LAPD Chief Michel Moore said during a February meeting of the Los Angeles City Council. \u201cWe have called in some officers on an overtime basis so that we can provide for these added patrols or station them at that site to deter vandals and others from gaining access.\u201d) Clean teams working in the neighborhoods surrounding Oceanwide remove on average some 2,000 square feet of graffiti per week, with that figure growing in recent months. \u201cPeople forget that people live here. People own businesses here and they don\u2019t want to have to spend the time and money to clean it up,\u201d said Blair Besten, executive director of the Historic Core of Downtown Los Angeles, an organization which works to improve the quality of life in downtown neighborhoods. The Historic Core prioritizes street sweeping, trash collection \u2014 and graffiti removal. \u201cI would hardly call what they\u2019re doing art,\u201d Besten argued of the Oceanwide taggers. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty sloppy and quick. They come in fast and they knock it out and they leave.\u201d But to Gastman, graffiti is a powerful form of expression, and a call-to-action \u2014 particularly for those who emanate from struggles within home life, gang life or societal turmoil. Graffiti culture can offer an unexpected support system for those the city has abandoned, Gastman said. It becomes a platform for them to make their voices heard. \u201cIn graffiti culture, a lot of us know each other. We\u2019re all friends. We have the same mentality \u2014 we\u2019re just trying to get up. We\u2019re just trying to get noticed,\u201d explained ENDEM. In the midst of an addiction that led to his rock bottom, graffiti became his lifeline, he explained. \u201cI was at my lowest of lows, still trying to stay sober, I needed some type of outlet,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cGraffiti is something that you can hold on to. Its bigger than me, its everyone, it\u2019s a community.\u201d In this, ENDEM believes that the beauty of Oceanwide isn\u2019t tangible. Rather, it lies in the birth of a new generation of graffiti writers. \u201cThey can erase the graffiti on buildings, but they can never erase the impact that it has on the city of Los Angeles and the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to it. Yes, it\u2019s vandalism. Yes, it\u2019s art, and it\u2019s everything in between,\u201d Gastman concluded. \u201cThis is a real culture. It\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/10/style/graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_19_asia_north-korea-russia-putin-visit-thursday-intl-hnk", "text": "Vladimir Putin said Russia and North Korea have ramped up ties to a \u201cnew level,\u201d pledging to help each other if either nation is attacked in a \u201cbreakthrough\u201d new partnership announced during the Russian president\u2019s rare visit to the reclusive state. Thousands of North Koreans chanting \u201cwelcome Putin\u201d\u00a0lined the city\u2019s wide boulevards brandishing Russian and North Korean flags and bouquets of flowers, as Putin kicked off his first visit to North Korea in 24 years with a finely choreographed display of influence in the dictatorship. The pair then signed the new strategic partnership to replace previous deals signed in 1961, 2000 and 2001, according to Russian state news agency TASS. \u201cThe comprehensive partnership agreement signed today includes, among other things, the provision of mutual assistance in the event of aggression against one of the parties to this agreement,\u201d Putin said after the meeting. He said the deal encompasses the \u201cpolitical, trade, investment, cultural spheres, and the security sphere as well,\u201d calling the pact \u201ctruly a breakthrough document.\u201d Putin said joint drills involving the United States, South Korea and Japan were \u201chostile\u201d toward North Korea,\u201d characterizing the US policy as \u201cconfrontational.\u201d Kim, meanwhile, called the new \u201calliance\u201d a \u201cwatershed moment in the development of the bilateral relations.\u201d But the deal between the two autocrats raised many questions, too \u2013 including whether Russia\u2019s nuclear deterrent now extends to North Korea, and vice versa, or whether the two nations will now hold joint military drills. Putin greeted with fanfare Putin was met with exuberant celebrations at a welcome ceremony with his counterpart at Kim Il Sung Square in the heart of the North Korean capital, where mounted soldiers, military personnel and children holding balloons cheered against the backdrop of large portraits of the each leader. The two leaders presented their respective officials and stood together as the Russian national anthem played before riding off standing shoulder to shoulder in an open-top limousine as they smiled and waved to the crowds. The scenes of pomp and fanfare were a constant throughout the day, which closed with Kim escorting Putin to his plane late in the evening ahead of his trip to Vietnam. The staging reflected North Korea\u2019s reliance on Moscow and was likely intended as a reminder to the West that Putin still holds considerable influence in at least some corners of the world, after his full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The relationship is important to Russia, too. Multiple governments have accused Pyongyang of supplying arms to Moscow for its grinding war in Ukraine, a charge both countries have denied, despite significant evidence of such transfers. On Wednesday Putin gave Kim an Aurus car when the two leaders exchanged gifts, according to Russian state media \u2013 the second time Putin has given his counterpart this car model. According to Putin\u2019s aide Yuri Ushakov, the Russian leader also presented Kim with a tea set. Ushakov did not specify what Putin received, but said they were \u201calso good gifts.\u201d Putin landed in North Korea in the early hours of Wednesday local time, exactly 24 years to the day he was last in Pyongyang, for a visit heralding the countries\u2019 deepening alignment in the face of shared animosity toward the West and international concerns over their growing military cooperation. In remarks ahead of talks between the two, Kim voiced his \u201cfull support and solidarity with the struggles of the Russian government, military and the people,\u201d pointing specifically to Moscow\u2019s war in Ukraine \u201cto protect its own sovereignty, safety and territorial stability.\u201d \u201cSituations continue to be complicated and ever-changing, but I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate that we will continue to strengthen and closely engage in strategic communication with the (Russian) leadership,\u201d Kim added. Putin hailed the countries\u2019 ties as based on \u201cequality and mutual respect,\u201d and said an expected new bilateral agreement would \u201cform the basis of relations between the two states for many years to come,\u201d according to Russian state agency TASS. He also added that he hoped Kim would visit Moscow for their next meeting. The burgeoning relationship has sparked concern in both Seoul and Washington, not only over North Korea\u2019s arms transfers to Russia, but also the prospect of Moscow transferring its superior military technology to aid Pyongyang\u2019s heavily sanctioned weapons program. \u2018Unwavering support\u2019 Kim, the third generation leader of a dynasty that has ruled North Korea with an iron fist, beamed visibly as he greeted Putin at the airport in the early hours of Wednesday morning, video footage of the Russian leader\u2019s arrival showed. The landmark visit marks a significant boost for Kim, who remains isolated on the world stage and has not hosted another world leader in his capital since the pandemic. It comes as tensions remain elevated on the Korean Peninsula, where Kim in recent months has ramped up bellicose language and scrapped a longstanding policy of seeking peaceful reunification with South Korea amid alarm in Pyongyang over tightening coordination between the US, South Korea and Japan. North Korea state media appeared to play heavily into the close rapport between Kim and Putin, describing them as \u201cexchanging their pent-up innermost thoughts and opened their minds to more surely develop (North Korea-Russia) relations,\u201d as rode together from the airport to the Kumsusan State Guest House where Putin is staying. Putin\u2019s trip follows\u00a0Kim\u2019s landmark visit to Russia last year, where the two leaders were widely seen as opening this\u00a0new chapter in their relations predicated on Putin\u2019s need for North Korean arms for its ongoing offensive. Russia has received more than 10,000 shipping containers \u2013 the equivalent of\u00a0260,000 metric tons\u00a0of munitions or munitions-related material \u2013 from North Korea since September, according to a US\u00a0statement\u00a0in February. Russian forces have also launched at least 10 North Korea-made missiles on Ukraine since September, a US official also\u00a0said\u00a0in March. The Russian leader is widely seen as looking to ensure this continued support, which may be especially urgent as delayed American military aid to Ukraine comes online. Putin also sought to link today\u2019s meeting to Moscow and Pyongyang\u2019s historic ties. The \u201cexploits of previous generations\u201d were a \u201cgood basis for the development of relations\u201d between the two nations, he told Kim, according to Russian state media TASS. A long history Putin made his last visit to Pyongyang in 2000 for a meeting with Kim\u2019s late father and predecessor Kim Jong Il. That trip, weeks after Putin\u2019s inauguration for his first term as president, made him the first Russian head of state to visit North Korea. The elder Kim then visited Moscow in 2001, taking a marathon nine-day rail trip across Russia for the meeting, in what was only his second overseas trip after an earlier visit to China. The two countries in 2000 also inked a new cooperation agreement. Unlike a 1961 document between the Soviet Union and North Korea, that new iteration did not include reference to mutual military defense assistance, but was seen as an important step in reviving a fraught and closely linked relationship. The two neighbors have deep ties on the Korean Peninsula. Kim\u2019s grandfather Kim Il Sung rose to power in the late 1940s as part of Soviet efforts to install a communist-controlled government in the north to rival a US-backed government in the south following the defeat of the Japanese imperial army during World War II. But tightly integrated relations frayed and transformed in the intervening decades, as the Soviet Union collapsed and the new state of Russia established diplomatic relations with Seoul and supported multiple United Nations sanctions on North Korea\u2019s weapons program. The latest raft of diplomacy comes as shared frustrations with the West have driven the two countries closer \u2013 a trend observers say has now been accelerated by the war in Ukraine and has seen North Korea gain a powerful friend in the UN Security Council. In March, Moscow\u00a0vetoed a UN resolution\u00a0to renew independent monitoring of North Korea\u2019s violations of Security Council sanctions \u2013 raising concerns about the relationship weakening controls on Kim\u2019s illegal weapons program.

{"id": "2024_06_16_uk_farage-uk-election-clacton-intl", "text": "At the end of Clacton Pier, where the salty North Sea breeze tangles with the sickly stench of the nearby amusement hall, a row of amateur fishermen gaze way off past the horizon, towards Europe. The lights and the noise here start early every day. Seagulls dart down from the sky; arcade games blare over each other; Radiohead, the Nineties alternative band, wails gloomily from a tinny speaker, until an employee notices, and puts on a dance anthem instead. The funfair is always in town, but the people have stopped coming. \u201cWe seem to be a bit forgotten down here in Clacton,\u201d Danny Botterell, a small business owner, tells CNN of his aging seaside home, which can no longer rely on visitors from London. He looks towards an empty seafront. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like God\u2019s waiting room.\u201d But Clacton is the front line of Britain\u2019s migration debate. And there is still one man who can draw a crowd: Nigel Farage, the rabble-rousing architect of Brexit and figurehead of the country\u2019s populist right, who told hundreds on the pier last week that he was running to be their member of parliament in next month\u2019s general election. Farage has pushed the boundaries of Britain\u2019s conversation on migration for a decade, and more recently sought to do the same in the United States, campaigning regularly alongside former President Donald Trump. He has returned to hammer the ruling Conservatives from the right once more, as though little has changed since the tempestuous EU referendum campaign eight years ago that resulted in the UK\u2019s departure from the bloc. \u201cWe know Nigel likes to get his point across, and shout,\u201d Botterell says. \u201cThat\u2019s a massive positive.\u201d Like many here, he expects Farage to \u201cspeak the truth.\u201d Farage is the favorite to win Clacton and become an MP at the eighth attempt. His Reform UK party is meanwhile swallowing up the support of dissatisfied ex-Conservatives across Britain, dragging the ruling party into what opinion polls suggest will be an ignominious battle for second place behind runaway leader Labour. One pollster this week had Reform \u2013 an upstart group formed by Farage in 2018, then known as the Brexit Party \u2013 overtaking the Conservatives. Others have them close behind. Britain\u2019s first-past-the-post electoral system makes it difficult for fringe groups like Reform to win more than a handful of seats in Westminster. But if the predicted surge holds, it could push Prime Minister Rishi Sunak\u2019s party to a once-in-a-lifetime defeat, and hand Farage an outsized role in British politics nonetheless. That is not an outcome asylum experts or rights groups welcome. They say Farage\u2019s presence in British life has already warped the country\u2019s understanding of migration, and hardened attitudes towards the tens of thousands caught in a backlog of unresolved asylum claims. \u201cHe can talk about migration in a way that makes it sound like he\u2019s really telling the truth \u2013 telling it like it is, and playing into people\u2019s deepest fears and prejudices,\u201d Zoe Gardner, a migration policy specialist, tells CNN. \u201cFarage knows he needs to stay one step ahead of where even the right wing of the Tories are,\u201d she adds, likening his rhetoric to Trump\u2019s on illegal migration across the southern US border. \u201cThey\u2019ll always want more,\u201d she says. \u201cTheir career is based on pushing things ever, ever, ever further.\u201d A \u2018closed\u2019 asylum system Clacton\u2019s pub landlords are well-acquainted with Farage, a natural political campaigner typically pictured with a pint in his hand. \u201cHe came in today,\u201d says Louise Brockwell, who runs the Three Jays pub, nodding to a stash of campaign posters left behind the bar. \u201cWhen he turns up, loads of people turn up.\u201d People recoil, too; few Britons are as divisive as Farage, whose career has relied in large part on his willingness to reach for alarmist and confrontational language when discussing immigration. Since announcing his candidacy he has warned supporters of an \u201cinvasion\u201d of asylum seekers, and was condemned by rival parties for claiming to Sky News that growing numbers of young Muslims \u201cdo not subscribe to British values.\u201d On Saturday, Foreign Secretary and former Prime Minister David Cameron \u2013 whose own premiership was thrown off course due to tussles with Farage over Europe \u2013 condemned his former foe\u2019s claim that Sunak, whose parents migrated to Britain from India, \u201cdoesn\u2019t understand our culture,\u201d made after Sunak returned early from events marking the 80th anniversary of D-Day. Cameron told The Times: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to watch sheep dog trials to hear a dog whistle.\u201d But Farage\u2019s relevance doesn\u2019t exist in a vacuum. Despite years of tough rhetoric and policies aimed at deterring the arrival of asylum seekers \u2013 devised largely to placate Farage\u2019s supporters \u2013 Britain\u2019s asylum system is creaking. Legal migration is higher than it was before the 2016 referendum, which has benefited Britain\u2019s understaffed public services and sectors like hospitality \u2013 one in five healthcare workers is a non-UK national \u2013 but placed pressure on other parts of the socio-economic fabric, like housing. And illegal migration \u2013 often mentioned in the same breath by Farage, and symbolized for millions of Brits by the small boat crossings across the Channel from France \u2013 has soared too, despite Sunak\u2019s pledge to \u201cStop the Boats.\u201d Put simply, Britain\u2019s approach to migrants and refugees is harsher, but less effective, than before. \u201cThe Tories have effectively closed the asylum system. You arrive, (and) your claim will not be processed,\u201d Gardner says. The Home Office declined to comment. Around 100,000\u00a0people are waiting to hear if they will be granted asylum \u2013 a limbo that can be punishing, particularly for those housed in hotels or detention centers, like the Bibby Stockholm barge that floats off Britain\u2019s southern coast. In the county of Kent, south of Clacton, one of those asylum seekers, Masood, tells CNN: \u201cIt\u2019s not a nice feeling to constantly have in your mind that any day, you can receive a letter (sending) you to the barge,\u201d or to the nearby Napier military barracks, another controversial detention site called \u201cfundamentally unsuitable\u201d by\u00a0a group of MPs\u00a0in 2022. Masood was born and raised in Afghanistan and initially came to the UK on a student visa, after studying in the UAE. He applied for asylum last year, and was immediately put in a taxi and sent to live in the hotel where he remains today. He fears for his safety in Afghanistan, having been critical online of the Taliban prior to their 2021 takeover of the country.\u00a0CNN is not publishing his last name, due to fears it would affect his claim. \u201cMy entire family is back there, and they\u2019re not recommending (I return),\u201d he says. \u201cI think if I decided to go back home, they might arrest me in the airport.\u201d He says his hotel is cramped, with most residents sharing rooms. Many have mental health difficulties, he adds. Laws prevent most asylum seekers from working, so while taxpayers fund their accommodation, they cannot contribute formally to the economy. But \u201cthey\u2019re working anyway \u2026 they\u2019re all getting paid in cash,\u201d Masood says of his fellow hotel residents. Regret in Brexit\u2019s spiritual home If Brexit began anywhere, it is Clacton. The decision by its then-Conservative MP, Douglas Carswell, to defect to Farage\u2019s UKIP party in 2014 accelerated Britain\u2019s Eurosceptic movement. Two years later, amid a heated debate over migration that Farage and others promised would be reduced, seven in 10 people in Clacton voted to leave the EU. The town is one of the Whitest, oldest and poorest in the UK \u2013 all factors that correlated with support for Brexit. \u201cClacton is a straw in the wind,\u201d Carswell tells CNN now, recalling a sense in the town that \u201cpeople who run the state \u2026 treat them with absolute contempt.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s been more of a conversation about these profound questions of governance, and national identity, in that part of Essex,\u201d adds Carswell, who co-founded the Vote Leave campaign during the referendum and is now president of the Mississippi Center for Public Policy. Back then, Brexit sliced Britain in two. Now it unites the country: virtually no-one thinks it is going well. \u201cI know why a lot of people (voted) out \u2013 the foreigners, immigrants. But it hasn\u2019t changed, has it?\u201d says 73-year-old John Terrier, outside his home in Jaywick, a village west of Clacton. He voted to leave too, but he has \u201cRegrexit.\u201d \u201cWhat was the point of doing it all?\u201d Terrier says, hammering a nail into a garden door. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind going back in.\u201d As he speaks, his next-door neighbor snipes back, aghast. Bob Brace, 69, was at Farage\u2019s rally last week. He sports a top emblazoned with a Union Jack. \u201cIs this not the most patriotic town in the country? I believe it is,\u201d he says. Opinion polls indicate that Britain would vote today to remain in the EU, though the public doesn\u2019t support holding another bitter referendum. The painful memories of that entire project have, in many ways, been buried; neither Sunak nor Labour leader Keir Starmer see any value in unearthing the rows of the past decade. There are other things to worry about, in any case. Jaywick,\u00a0statistically\u00a0England\u2019s most deprived neighborhood, is comprised of ramshackle rows of beachside chalets, each third or fourth home boarded up like a blackened tooth. Residents here have many grievances \u2013 the roads, the health service, the schools \u2013 but concerns about immigration underpin almost every one. And after the European Parliament elections this month, in which the UK no longer plays a part, some see a movement brewing. \u201cIt\u2019s not just here. It\u2019s France, Netherlands, Germany, they\u2019ve all got the same crisis,\u201d says Karen French, a Reform supporter, sipping coffee and eating a sausage bap by the shore. \u201cI\u2019ve seen their votes and they\u2019re all starting to head towards (the) far right as well.\u201d A political storm gathers Farage initially announced he wouldn\u2019t stand in the July 4 election, citing his desire to campaign on behalf of Trump in the fall. Farage declined to give an interview for this story, as did the Labour and Conservative candidates in Clacton. But his U-turn animated both supporters and critics. Farage has had a milkshake tipped over his head and objects thrown at his open-top campaign bus in the past two weeks. Several of Reform\u2019s election candidates have meanwhile been dropped after racist comments they had made online emerged. Most recently, a candidate in the North West Essex constituency, Grant StClair-Armstrong, resigned from the party after his previous support for the British National Party \u2013 a far-right organization \u2013 was uncovered by The Times of London newspaper. Farage\u2019s entry also stoked Conservative fears of an electoral catastrophe. On Monday, as he launched Reform UK\u2019s election manifesto, Farage told the BBC he was aiming to credibly stand to be prime minister in the following election, which would take place in 2029 or sooner. It is an outlandish prospect as things stand, but some Tories have in recent days made overtures towards him to join their party \u2013 and Farage has not ruled out attempting a hostile takeover of the Conservatives. \u201cHe\u2019s definitely a polarizing figure. But from an electoral point of view, that doesn\u2019t really matter,\u201d says James Johnson, who ran polling at Downing Street during Theresa May\u2019s premiership and then co-founded pollster JL Partners. \u201cBy the voters who are considering voting Reform, he is very, very, well liked\u201d he says of Farage \u2013 more so than Queen Elizabeth II was among Britons, according to Johnson\u2019s data. Not everyone in Clacton buys what Farage is selling. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of smoke,\u201d says restauranter Dean Coles. \u201cHe\u2019s a little bit shouty shouty, more than a do-er.\u201d Jehosh Adekiyesi, a social care worker, is blunter. \u201cA lot of people say a lot of sh*t. When you give them recognition, they say more. When you ignore them, they become irrelevant,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t take him seriously.\u201d But it is becoming harder not to; even pulling in a sixth of voters could demolish the Conservatives and elevate his voice in the postmortem that takes place on the opposition benches. That could widen even further the chasm in understanding between his voters and Britain\u2019s asylum seekers, experts like Zoe Gardner fear. \u201cThey really, desperately need a solution,\u201d says Gardner.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/16/uk/farage-uk-election-clacton-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "world"}}

Ecuador\u2019s government is expected to hold a press conference later on Wednesday to address the matter. The blackout affected hospitals, homes, and a major subway system in the country as the government scrambled to find a response. Ecuador has been struggling with an energy crisis for years. The latest saw Ecuadorean President Daniel Noboa declare an energy emergency in April and order eight-hour nationwide power cuts amid a drought that affected power generation. In the\u00a0capital\u00a0city of\u00a0Quito, a CNN team saw two hospitals, including a children\u2019s medical center, lose power during\u00a0the blackout.

Around 270 million people in the US will experience temperatures at or above 90 degrees this week as an impressive heat dome parks over the eastern US. Hundreds of records could be tied or broken this week. Multiple all-time June high temperature records could fall as the heat rises to levels normally seen only on the hottest July days. Parts of the Midwest to the Northeast could endure the longest heat wave they\u2019ve seen in decades, the National Weather Service\u2019s Weather Prediction Center said. Scientists have warned that heat waves will become increasingly severe as the climate crisis intensifies. Tens of millions of people who live as far north as Maine and aren\u2019t used to heat this intense will be sweating in temperatures well into the 90s this week. It will feel even hotter than that as humidity helps drive heat index values \u2013 how temperatures feel to the body \u2013 into the low 100s. Read more: Search continues for US tourist and two others missing amid Greek heat wave An extreme heat risk is in place from the Great Lakes into the Northeast this week, according to the National Weather Service. Wednesday and Thursday will be the hottest days of the week, but the surrounding days will only be slightly less brutal. Heat will reach dangerous levels in many places including the major metropolitan areas of Chicago, St. Louis, Detroit, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, New York City and Boston. Temperatures soared 15 to 20 degrees above normal Monday afternoon and remained at elevated levels overnight. A few dozen temperature records fell as a result, including daily record highs in Chicago and Cleveland, and daily record warm low temperatures in places like Des Moines, Iowa. Temperatures will rise up to 25 degrees above normal through the rest of the workweek. Some areas, including Montpelier, Vermont; Syracuse, New York; and Pittsburgh, haven\u2019t seen heat like this in about three decades. \u201cLast time we saw heat in Pittsburgh like what we\u2019re expecting next week was 30 yrs ago (almost to the day) when it reached 95\u00b0F or warmer for 6 straight days (June 15-20, 1994),\u201d the local weather service office said on X. \u201cThat stands as the longest stretch of 95+ (degree) days on record. We have a shot at tying or beating that.\u201d Some affected areas have started to activate heat protocols. Cooling centers will open across New York City starting Tuesday and cooling kits will be distributed to people working outdoors, Mayor Eric Adams said Monday. Burlington, Vermont, will also activate cooling centers starting Tuesday, according to the city. Recreation centers in Cleveland will be open for extended hours this week to serve as cooling centers, city officials said Monday. The city also suspended all playground programs for the week as temperatures soar. Heat domes like the one fueling this week\u2019s intense conditions trap air in place and bake it with abundant sunshine for days on end, making each day hotter than the last. The oven-like conditions mean overnight temperatures often don\u2019t cool down enough to offer relief for overheated bodies, posing increased risks for heat-related illness. \u201cWarm overnight temperatures only dropping into the mid-70s will offer little to no relief, especially to those without adequate or reliable cooling,\u201d the Weather Prediction Center said.   Humidity will also join forces with extreme heat to create triple-digit heat indices \u2013 measurements of how hot the human body feels \u2013 in some areas. Chicago residents could feel\u00a0heat indices between 95 and 105 degrees through next week, the NWS in Chicago warned. Parts of eastern New York and western New England could see indices as high as 107 degrees. The NWS in Detroit, where the heat index could reach 100 degrees, urged residents to practice heat safety in the coming days, including limiting strenuous outdoor activities, staying hydrated, and checking up on neighbors who are elderly or don\u2019t have A/C. Heat-related illness is a concern in severely impacted areas, particularly for the elderly, young children and outdoor workers. Extreme heat is by far the deadliest form of severe weather, killing on average twice as many people a year as tornadoes and hurricanes combined.

The beach at the Herculaneum archaeological park is thought to be the site where more than 300 men tried in vain to save themselves from the natural disaster in 79AD while awaiting rescue by a civil protection force directed by the admiral and illustrious Roman scholar Pliny the Elder. It reopened to the public Wednesday following years of archaeological excavations and restoration works, during which human remains and other evidence of the eruption were discovered. \u201cIt was not only a restoration work but also a great research work because we know that re-presenting a site, in an open-air archaeological place, also means being able to delve into scientific aspects: we carried out excavations and found remains and the passage of pyroclastic flows that hit the city in 79AD with materials of all kinds,\u201d the director of the Herculaneum archaeological park Francesco Sirano said. The most important discovery at Herculaneum was that of the \u201clast fugitive\u201d which occurred in 2021: a skeleton of a man of around 40 years of age who was probably trying to escape towards the sea and who had with him a bag containing his most precious objects. \u201cHerculaneum, Pompeii, Oplontis: we are working on many projects\u201d, the Italian Minister of Culture Gennaro Sangiuliano said Wednesday. \u201cIn the budget law we have refinanced the excavations and there are construction sites that are active like never before and are revealing new treasures, which fuel the activity of scholars.\u201d \u201cWe believe in all of this: in creating, connecting, strengthening this area which UNESCO has also recognized as of great value and which is one of the most important archaeological areas in the world.

{"id": "2024_06_12_style_fumihiko-maki-architect-dies", "text": "Tokyo (AP) \u2014 Japanese architect Fumihiko Maki, who won the prestigious Pritzker Prize for designs praised as smartly and artfully fusing the East with the West, has died. He was 95. Maki, who taught architecture and urban design at Harvard, died June 6, his office, Maki & Associates, said Wednesday. Japanese media reports attributed the cause of death to old age. The office declined to confirm the reports. The National Museum of Modern Art in Kyoto is considered one of his classic designs, with floating forms of glass, metal and concrete. Its gray exterior appears simple at first glance but sets off patterns of reflected light on rough and polished marble. In the U.S., Maki\u2019s projects included the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco and 4 World Trade Center in New York. He also did the Makuhari Messe exhibition hall in Chiba, Japan, and the Hillside Terrace Complex in Tokyo. Maki in the 1980s designed Tokyo\u2019s Spiral building, whose management mourned his death and thanked him for \u201cthe beautiful slopes and the rich space that envisioned an urban park.\u201d In 2013, Maki\u00a0complained about the then planned spaceship-like design\u00a0of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics stadium, slamming it as too expensive and clashing with its surroundings. He said he had the support 100 other people, including architects, in opposing the size of the proposed design by British-Iraqi architect Zaha Hadid. \u201cThe problems I see with the planned stadium all relate to the issue of scale,\u201d he said.That design was eventually ditched for a more modest-looking design by\u00a0Kengo Kuma\u00a0which used pieces of wood for a natural Japanese look. Born in Tokyo in 1928, Maki was educated at the University of Tokyo, the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Michigan and Harvard University Graduate School of Design. Before opening his own design firm in 1965 in Tokyo, he worked in various offices including Skidmore Owings and Merrill, or SOM, based in Chicago, and Sert, Jackson & Associates in Cambridge, as well as the campus planning office of Washington University in St. Louis. A devoted educator, Maki, in addition to teaching at Washington University, Harvard and the University of Tokyo, lectured around the world. His essays were published in a collection called \u201cNurturing Dreams\u201d by MIT Press in 2008. In it, he explored the Japanese sense of space called \u201coku,\u201d which Maki described as \u201cthe core of this high-density space organized into multiple layers like an onion.\u201d Utilizing oku allowed the Japanese to deliver a feeling of depth even in a cramped area, according to this theory. \u201cIn the formation of urban space, certain stable concepts that have been sifted and committed to memory by the collective unconscious of the community work automatically,\u201d Maki wrote. \u201cOku, a spatial concept peculiar to Japan, is a good example, and I believe an understanding of this way of perceiving space is important in formulating ideas of what future cities should be like.\u201d Maki was the second Japanese to win the Pritzker, hailed as the Nobel Prize of architecture, after Kenzo Tange, his mentor. Maki, along with fellow Tange students\u00a0Arata Isozaki\u00a0and\u00a0Kisho Kurokawa, were the pillars of Japanese modernism. The Pritzker, in selecting Maki, praised him as part of a new wave of architects rebuilding postwar Japan. \u201cHe uses light in a masterful way making it as tangible a part of every design as are the walls and roof. In each building, he searches for a way to make transparency, translucency and opacity exist in total harmony. He uses detail to give his structures rhythm and scale,\u201d Bill Lacy, a member of the international panel of jurors that selected Maki, said at the time. Maki was honored with other awards, such as the Wolf Prize from Israel in 1988 and the Arnold Brunner Prize from the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1999. In 2011, the American Institute of Architects honored Maki with its highest accolade, the AIA Gold Medal. Japanese media reports said a memorial service was planned.

{"id": "2024_06_18_asia_north-korea-russia-putin-visit-intl-hnk", "text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin has landed in North Korea for a rare visit that signals the two countries\u2019 deepening alignment and Moscow\u2019s need to source weapons from Pyongyang to sustain its war on Ukraine. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un personally greeted Putin at the plane ramp as he arrived in the North Korean capital of Pyongyang in the early hours of Wednesday morning local time, video footage of his arrival showed. State media RIA reported that the two leaders talked animatedly with each other for several minutes before reaching their motorcade. The pair then rode together to the Kumsusan State Guest House where Putin will be staying, according to North Korean state media KCNA, and the two leaders \u201cexchanged their pent-up innermost thoughts and opened their minds to more surely develop (North Korea-Russia) relations in conformity with the common desire and will of the peoples of the two countries.\u201d After arriving at the guesthouse, they held a \u201cfriendly chat,\u201d KCNA added. The streets of Pyongyang were decked out with Russian flags and posters of Putin ahead of his first visit to the country since 2000. This week\u2019s visit is a rare overseas trip for Putin since he launched the invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and a key moment for Kim, who has not hosted another world leader in his politically isolated country since the Covid-19 pandemic. Putin\u2019s visit will be closely watched across the world and is expected to cement further the burgeoning partnership between the two powers that is founded on their shared animosity toward the West and driven by Moscow\u2019s need for munitions for its war in Ukraine. Following his visit to North Korea, Putin is scheduled to travel to Hanoi in a display of Communist-governed Vietnam\u2019s ties to Russia that is likely to rankle the United States. Putin\u2019s trip to North Korea will have a \u201cvery eventful\u201d agenda, his aide Yuri Ushakov said during a press conference Monday. Both leaders plan to sign a new strategic partnership, Ushakov said. Ushakov insisted the agreement is not provocative or aimed against other countries, but is meant to ensure greater stability in northeast Asia. He said the new agreement will replace documents signed between Moscow and Pyongyang in 1961, 2000 and 2001. Satellite imagery from Planet Labs and Maxar Technologies showed preparations for a large parade in Pyongyang\u2019s central square. One image was of a grandstand being constructed on the eastern side of Kim Il Sung Square, the site where all major parades in North Korea are held. In an earlier image, taken on June 5, North Koreans can be seen practicing marching formations. US national security spokesman John Kirby told reporters Monday the Biden administration wasn\u2019t \u201cconcerned about the trip\u201d itself, but added, \u201cWhat we are concerned about is the deepening relationship between these two countries.\u201d The US, South Korea and other countries have accused North Korea of providing substantial military aid to Russia\u2019s war effort in recent months, while observers have raised concerns that Moscow may be violating international sanctions to aid Pyongyang\u2019s development of its nascent military satellite program. Both countries have denied North Korean arms exports. Putin\u2019s trip reciprocates one Kim made last September, when the North Korean leader traveled in his armored train to Russia\u2019s far eastern region, for a visit that included stops at a factory that produces fighter jets and a rocket-launch facility. It also comes as tensions remain high on the Korean peninsula amid heightened international concern about the North Korean leader\u2019s intentions as he ramped up bellicose language and scrapped a longstanding policy of seeking peaceful reunification with South Korea. South Korea fired warning shots on Tuesday after North Korean soldiers working in the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) separating the two Koreas briefly crossed into the South, according to South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff, the second incident of its kind in the last two weeks. An \u2018advancing partnership\u2019 Kim last week hailed the future of the countries\u2019 \u201cmeaningful ties and close comradeship\u201d in a message to Putin commemorating Russia\u2019s national day on June 12. \u201cOur people give full support and solidarity to the successful work of the Russian army and people,\u201d Kim said, according to the official Rodong Sinmun newspaper. In an article for the same newspaper published early Tuesday local time, Putin thanked Pyongyang for showing \u201cunwavering support\u201d for Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and said the two countries were \u201cready to confront the ambition of the collective West.\u201d He said the two were \u201cactively advancing their multifaceted partnership\u201d and would \u201cdevelop alternative trade and mutual settlements mechanisms not controlled by the West, jointly oppose illegitimate unilateral restrictions, and shape the architecture of equal and indivisible security in Eurasia.\u201d The meeting comes just days after a summit of the Group of Seven (G7) developed economies in Italy attended by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, where Western leaders reiterated their enduring support for Ukraine and agreed to use profits from frozen Russian assets to back a $50 billion loan to the war-torn country. It also follows a Kyiv-backed international peace summit over the weekend attended by more than 100 countries and organizations, which was meant to drum up support for Zelensky\u2019s vision for peace, which calls for a complete withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukrainian territory. Putin rebuffed those efforts a day ahead of the gathering by offering his own peace conditions, including the withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from four partially occupied regions and that Kyiv withdraw its bid to join NATO \u2013 a position seen as nonstarter by Ukraine and its allies. Putin\u2019s visit to North Korea is widely viewed as an opportunity for him to seek to bolster Kim\u2019s support for his war \u2013 a goal that may be increasingly urgent as long-delayed American military aid for Ukraine comes online. Last month, US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin told American lawmakers the provision of North Korean munitions and missiles, as well as Iranian drones, had allowed Russian forces \u201cto get back up on their feet.\u201d Between August and February, Pyongyang shipped about 6,700 containers to Russia, which could accommodate more than 3 million rounds of 152 mm artillery shells or more than 500,000 rounds of 122 mm multiple rocket launchers, South Korea\u2019s defense ministry said earlier this year. Both Moscow and Pyongyang have denied such arms transfers, with a senior North Korean official last month calling such allegations an \u201cabsurd paradox.\u201d When asked about concerns that Russia is considering the transfer of sensitive technologies to Pyongyang in exchange for those goods, a Kremlin spokesperson last week said the countries\u2019 \u201cpotential for developing bilateral relations\u201d was \u201cprofound\u201d and \u201cshould not cause concern to anyone and should not and cannot be challenged by anyone.\u201d Putin on the world stage Putin last visited North Korea in 2000, his first year as president of Russia, where he met with Kim\u2019s predecessor and late father Kim Jong Il. His travel now to North Korea and then Vietnam comes as the Russian leader appears keen to re-establish himself on the global stage, chipping away at an image of isolation in the wake of his widely condemned invasion of Ukraine by drawing in like-minded partners. Last month Putin made a state visit to Beijing, where he and Chinese leader Xi Jinping made a sweeping affirmation of their shared opposition to what they see as a US-led world order. Moscow last week hosted foreign ministers from countries including China, Iran, South Africa and Brazil for a meeting of the BRICS group of major developing economies. US national security spokesman John Kirby on Monday called Putin\u2019s latest travel a \u201ccharm offensive\u201d following the leader\u2019s re-election. Putin won his fifth term earlier this year in a contest without true opposition. Putin\u2019s move to bolster North Korean ties has also been a boon for Kim, who remains unbowed by years of international sanctions over his illegal nuclear weapons program. The visit from a leader of a permanent member country of the United Nations Security Council will provide a signal to Kim\u2019s domestic audience of his global clout \u2013 and a chance to push for deeply needed economic and technological support from Moscow. Russia previously backed international sanctions and UN-backed investigations into North Korea\u2019s illegal weapons program, which includes tests of long-range intercontinental ballistic missiles that could in theory reach the US mainland. But Russia\u2019s apparent increasing reliance on North Korea and rising frictions with the West appear to have shifted that dynamic. In March, Moscow vetoed a UN resolution to renew independent monitoring of North Korea\u2019s violations of Security Council sanctions.

{"id": "2024_06_18_style_martine-rose-brings-a-slice-of-london-to-milan-fashion-week", "text": "With flyers strewn across the floor, metal barriers covered in recycled plastic, and a sporadic assembly of plastic chairs arranged in dimly-lit arts space south of central Milan, British menswear designer Martine Rose eschewed the polish often associated with the Italian fashion capital, giving guests a taste of her native North London\u2019s gritty charm instead. \u201cI wanted it to be a bit of a mess,\u201d said Rose ahead of the show on Sunday that marked her debut on the Milan Fashion Week schedule after years presenting her label in London. \u201cI want people to go in into it and there be this beauty but not in a [instantly] recognizable [way].\u201d This subverted starting point is a longstanding signature of Rose\u2019s brand and one that has no doubt contributed to her being one of the most sought-after and influential designers of her generation. In addition to running her business \u2014 one that remained independent since its launch in 2007 until The Tomorrow Group invested in 2021 \u2014 she has consulted behind the scenes for prominent fashion houses including Balenciaga, been shortlisted for the prestigious LVMH Fashion Prize, among many others, and picked up the coveted Menswear Designer of The Year trophy at the 2023 Fashion Awards. For her Spring-Summer 2025 show, she continued to challenge traditional concepts of masculinity and classic codes of tailoring. Dedicated to \u201cexpressions of beauty spawned from the likes of disturbance, humour, and sex,\u201d according to show notes, the collection saw whipstitched T-shirts worn with tartan shorts and fishnet socks; a \u201cparty shirt\u201d featuring the headshots of Rose\u2019s studio team and their families; and tailoring taken out of proportion with nipped-in waists and broad-shouldered blazers worn with leather pants featuring front zips \u201cfor easy access.\u201d \u201cThere is a familiar subversion but I never intend for things to be shocking,\u201d she explained. \u201cThe things that I put on the on the catwalk I genuinely think are real proposals for men.\u201d Case in point, the sporty polo shirts and hot-pink cagoules that came perfectly tucked into pencil skirts. \u201cThere\u2019s something somehow more radical in a man wearing a pencil skirt and I\u2019m curious as to why, because there\u2019s nothing particularly radical about the sober length and we see Bermuda shorts and kilts of that length,\u201d said Rose. \u201cThese are the questions that I find really interesting, not about gender but about clothes. And the men look amazing in it.\u201d In a further twist, prosthetic noses were administered to every model, each of whom had been street cast in Milan. Rose does this for all her shows, reemphasising the importance of the \u201clocal hero,\u201d a phrase that appeared as logos on baseball caps and silk ties. Milan is something of a fitting host for Rose\u2019s brand with the two sharing a sense of intrigue on first impression. While Milan\u2019s austere architecture famously conceals its hidden gardens and a warm hospitality, the confronting setting and external attitude of Rose\u2019s catwalk shows are portals to a creative conversation that has community at its heart. As Rose notes of Milan, \u201cit reveals itself slowly\u201d. That Rose opted to show her collection in Milan this season (off the back of showing in Florence and Paris previously) as opposed to London, deals another blow to the British Fashion Council\u2019s (BFC) menswear schedule that was once a hotbed of emerging talent but has lost a number of key brands including JW Anderson, A-Cold-Wall and Wales Bonner, to other fashion weeks over the last six years. \u201cYou would think that I would come back and appreciate London more, but actually it makes me realise what London has lost and continues to lose,\u201d she said in reference to what she sees as a lack of investment in the industry. \u201cEvery other European city seems to take [creativity] seriously and that makes me sad. And then of course, layer on Brexit, and it\u2019s actually a disaster for all of the creative sector.\u201d Despite the direct value of the UK fashion industry to the UK economy standing at nearly \u00a321 billion (approximately $27 billion), according to the BFC, and fashion graduates taking top positions at international fashion houses for decades, Rose said, \u201cit\u2019s incredibly infuriating and depressing that it\u2019s not taken seriously. As soon as you get any particular type of sort of success and recognition, you have to move to Paris or Italy to get seen, the natural thing is to leave London and that\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d \u201cThere are [designers] doing really interesting stuff, it\u2019s just that they get no support from anywhere else to do it,\u201d she continued. \u201cRents are impossible, they get no subsidies\u2026it\u2019s off people\u2019s own bat, which is really hard to sustain.\u201d Following the rapturous reception at Sunday\u2019s show, it appears that London\u2019s loss is Milan\u2019s gain.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/style/martine-rose-brings-a-slice-of-london-to-milan-fashion-week/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_19_asia_vietnam-russia-putin-visit-intl-hnk", "text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived in the Vietnamese capital Hanoi on Wednesday, fresh from a rare meeting in North Korea\u00a0with counterpart Kim Jong Un in which the two autocrats agreed a new strategic partnership driven by Moscow\u2019s need for weapons for its war in Ukraine. Considered a pariah by the West, Putin is looking to boost economic ties with friendly countries and show that Western isolation is not having an impact. Already Putin\u2019s visit to communist-run Vietnam has rankled the United States, with a spokesperson for the US Embassy in Hanoi reportedly criticizing the trip saying, \u201cno country should give Putin a platform to promote his war of aggression and otherwise allow him to normalize his atrocities,\u201d according to Reuters. Putin\u2019s two-day visit to the Southeast Asian nation is set to include meetings with Vietnamese leadership including Communist Party General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong and the new President To Lam, according to Russian state-run news agency TASS, citing the Kremlin. Much like his visit to Pyongyang, Putin\u2019s trip to Hanoi could signal deepening relations between the two nations as the Russian leader looks to garner concrete support amid international sanctions over his grinding war in Ukraine. Vietnam\u2019s Ambassador to Russia Dang Minh Koi told the Vietnam News Agency that the state visit will strengthen Hanoi-Moscow ties, and be \u201can opportunity for the leaders of the two countries to discuss and propose concrete measures to boost bilateral trade and economic cooperation,\u201d TASS reported. A joint statement is expected to be adopted and numerous agreements announced on cooperation in sectors including \u201ctrade and economic, scientific, technological and humanitarian areas,\u201d according to Russian presidential foreign policy aide Yury\u00a0Ushakov, TASS reported. Moscow has been a major supplier of weapons to Vietnam since the Soviet era and analysts say arms and energy talks could feature on the agenda. The visit also showcases Vietnam\u2019s foreign policy balancing act, which like India, enables the\u00a0country to be on friendly terms with rival major powers including Russia, the United States and China \u2013 all vital trading partners. Last year, Vietnam hosted both Chinese leader Xi Jinping and US President Joe Biden. That trip resulted in the US and Vietnam upgrading diplomatic ties to a \u201ccomprehensive strategic partnership,\u201d in a historic sign of improving relations between the former foes. The two nations have accelerated trade in recent years and the US is currently reviewing an upgrade to Vietnam\u2019s market economy status that would allow Hanoi to benefit from lower tariffs on goods imported into the US. Vietnam is center to US efforts to counter rising Chinese influence in the region and a key part of Washington\u2019s Indo-Pacific strategy. Vietnam in turn is keen to benefit from American efforts to diversify supply chains outside of China as well as US concern over China\u2019s military build-up in the South China Sea. The two countries have built up their partnership just decades after fighting a devastating\u00a0war that decimated the country. \u201cFrom the Vietnamese perspective, Russia is still seen as an important partner with deep historical ties and important roles to play in Vietnam\u2019s defense and security policy,\u201d said Le Hong Hiep, senior fellow of the Vietnam Studies Program at\u00a0Singapore\u2019s ISEAS \u2013 Yusof Ishak Institute. But he said, \u201cVietnam is also careful not to be seen as being too close to Russia or to be supporting Russia in Ukraine\u2026 The US and its allies play a much more significant role in Vietnam\u2019s security and economic development.\u201d Putin faces an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court (ICC) for an alleged scheme to deport Ukrainian children to Russia. Vietnam and Russia are not members of the ICC. Vietnam was among several Southeast Asian countries that abstained from joining a global summit on Ukraine in Switzerland last week. But Western hopes of an isolated Russia appear to not be bearing out as Putin ramps up his outreach to friendly countries and efforts to establish a new global order in opposition to the West. In May, Putin met Xi in Beijing \u2013 his symbolic first overseas trip since starting a\u00a0new term as Russia\u2019s president \u2013 where the two leaders vowed to deepen their strategic partnership in opposition to the US. Now, Putin is visiting two of China\u2019s neighbors in what US national security spokesman John Kirby on Monday called a \u201ccharm offensive\u201d following the leader\u2019s re-election. Crucially, Moscow assumed the rotating presidency of the China and Russia-backed\u00a0BRICS economic group this year and will welcome member and observer nations to its southwestern city of Kazan in October. More than three dozen countries are seeking entry into the bloc and Russia will be the first member to oversee the body since it significantly\u00a0expanded its global footprint\u00a0at the start of the year, when Iran, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Ethiopia, and Egypt formally joined. For Moscow and Beijing, the expansion is widely viewed as a drive to forge a new world order by turning the loose economic grouping into a geopolitical counterweight to the West \u2013 and Western institutions dominated by the US, such as the G7. Malaysia is the latest country preparing to join the group, according to Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, as reported in Chinese media on Tuesday. Vietnam\u00a0has expressed interest in BRICS, with a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman saying in May \u201cwe pay attention to the process of the BRICS membership expansion,\u201d according to Vietnamese state media. Last week, Vietnam sent a delegation led by its Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs to attend the BRICS Foreign Ministers\u2019 Summit in Russia.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/asia/vietnam-russia-putin-visit-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_china_north-korea-russia-putin-kim-visit-ukraine-analysis-intl-hnk", "text": "As Russian President Vladimir Putin makes his first visit to North Korea in more than two decades, his focus is widely seen to be on securing ongoing support from the hermit nation for his grinding war in Ukraine. Putin ramped up his outreach to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un last year as his weapons stockpiles dwindled \u2013 and munitions and missiles have flowed from the country to Russia since a landmark summit between the two leaders in September, multiple governments say, even as both Pyongyang and Moscow deny the transfers. But while the leaders\u2019 meeting in the globally isolated, Soviet-style capital of Pyongyang provides an opportunity for the two autocrats to discuss how to expand that cooperation, observers say it will have consequences far beyond the battlefield in Ukraine. Putin\u2019s arrival in Pyongyang in the early hours of Wednesday local time for the two-day visit marks a significant step forward for a partnership founded on shared hostility to the West and its allies \u2013 one that empowers both leaders and deepens global fault lines. The two are expected to ink a new strategic partnership agreement, with Putin saying ahead of the visit that they would \u201cshape the architecture of equal and indivisible security in Eurasia,\u201d according to the Kremlin. \u201cThe relationship is not just about necessity,\u201d said Edward Howell, a lecturer in politics at the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom, who focuses on the Korean Peninsula. \u201cWe are seeing the two states forge an increasingly concerted united front and alignment against the United States and the West.\u201d These divisions were only underscored by the timing of the visit, which comes on the heels of Putin\u2019s meeting with close ally Chinese leader Xi Jinping last month and after democratic leaders from the Group of Seven (G7) used a summit in Italy to again show their solidarity against Moscow\u2019s war. It also comes as North Korea has railed against growing security cooperation between the US and its allies South Korea and Japan, raising concerns with its escalated rhetoric and ongoing tests to bolster an extensive illegal weapons program. It remains publicly unknown just what Pyongyang is receiving in return for its support for Russia\u2019s war. But governments from Seoul to Washington will be watching closely for signs of how far the warring Russian leader, who in the past supported international controls on North Korea\u2019s illegal weapons program, is willing to go to back Kim\u2019s bellicose regime. What do Russia and North Korea want from each other? In the months after Kim rode his armored train through the country\u2019s Far East region for a landmark September summit with Putin, North Korean munitions appeared to pour into Russia \u2013 and be fired in its assault on Ukraine. Russia has received more than 10,000 shipping containers \u2013 the equivalent of 260,000 metric tons of munitions or munitions-related material \u2013 from North Korea since September, according to a US statement in February. Russian forces have also launched at least 10 North Korea-made missiles on Ukraine since September, a US official also said in March. The weapons may be of lesser quality than Russia\u2019s own, but have helped Russia replenish its dwindling stockpiles and keep pace with the weapons support Ukraine is receiving from the West, observers say. The arrangement may also enable North Korea to gain real-world intel on the functioning of its weaponry and help it ramp up exports more broadly. In an article published in North Korea state media ahead of the visit, Putin thanked Pyongyang for showing \u201cunwavering support\u201d for Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and said the two countries were \u201cready to confront the ambition of the collective West.\u201d Putin is widely seen as set to use his visit, which Kim invited him to make last September, to secure ongoing support. Less is known about exactly what compensation Pyongyang has received so far in return. South Korean officials have said the North is receiving shipments of food and other necessities from Russia, and there is no shortage of needs for the sanctions-strapped economy, which in addition to food lacks fuel and raw materials \u2013 but also seeks to advance its space, missile and nuclear programs. Putin signaled a willingness to assist North Korea in developing its space and satellite program during their September meeting, which took place, fittingly, at a rocket launch facility. There have since been signs that such assistance has taken place, including the successful launch of North Korea\u2019s first military reconnaissance satellite the \u201cMalligyong-1\u201d weeks after the visit, following two failed attempts. Such satellites can help North Korea improve its ground-based military capabilities, for example enabling it to more accurately target opponents\u2019 forces with its own missiles.  United Nations member states are barred from directly or indirectly aiding North Korea\u2019s missile programs as well as engaging in arms transfers with Pyongyang. But Kim is also eyeing access to know-how for a range of Russian advanced weaponry, experts say, as well as technology linked to uranium enrichment, reactor designs or nuclear propulsion for submarines. The North Korean leader sees his weapons programs as essential to the survival of his regime, according to analysts. \u201cKim Jong Un will be interested in asking the world from Russia, whether he\u2019ll get that or not is another question,\u201d said Ankit Panda, a senior fellow in the nuclear policy program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace think tank in Washington. It\u2019s unlikely that Putin would be \u201ctoo eager to necessarily initiate cooperation on those issues (nuclear related technologies) when there\u2019s a long list of less sensitive technologies that the Russians can part with\u201d like improving radar or surface-to-air missile systems, he said. When asked last week about Western concerns that Russia is considering the transfer of sensitive technologies to Pyongyang, a Kremlin spokesperson said the countries\u2019 \u201cpotential for developing bilateral relations\u201d was \u201cprofound\u201d and \u201cshould not cause concern to anyone and should not and cannot be challenged by anyone.\u201d \u2018A tragic world\u2019 However, any support from Putin \u2013 a leader of a UN Security Council permanent member state \u2013 is a significant boon for Kim, who is deeply isolated on the world stage. For Putin, too, the visit is an opportunity to send a signal, or a threat, that Russia is not alone. \u201cPutin is highlighting that Russia has friends \u2013 and is propagating the idea that the war is not winnable for Ukraine because Russia will not run out of weapons,\u201d said John Erath, senior policy director for the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation non-profit in Washington. The Russian leader may also see the relationship with Kim as a way to raise the specter of nuclear war, exploiting \u201cUS and South Korean concerns about North Korea,\u201d so that \u201cUkraine\u2019s friends will compel it to seek a negotiated \u2018solution\u2019 on Russia\u2019s terms,\u201d Erath added. Putin laid out his peace conditions on Friday ahead of a Ukraine-backed international peace summit over the weekend that Russia did not attend. They included the withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from four partially occupied regions \u2013 a position seen as nonstarter by Kyiv and its allies. And in his letter published in North Korea state media ahead of the visit, Putin framed the two countries as both facing down what he called US efforts to impose a \u201cneocolonialist dictatorship\u201d over the world. Observers agree that Putin is unlikely at this point to directly help North Korea\u2019s nuclear program, as neither Putin nor his close partner Xi want to see nuclear confrontation in the region. But it\u2019s also become clear that growing North Korea-Russia ties, as well as the widening chasm between Russia, China and the West, is impacting international efforts to control North Korea\u2019s weapons program. Russia in March vetoed a UN resolution to renew an independent panel of experts investigating the country\u2019s violations of Security Council sanctions. China abstained from the vote. Both countries in recent years have blocked movement in the council related to North Korea as they grew skeptical of US-backed sanctions. Deepening divisions today contrast collaboration in recent decades between Russia, China and the US, according to former US Ambassador to Russia and National Security Council official Michael McFaul. He pointed to his experiences during the former US President Barack Obama administration working on nonproliferation efforts related to North Korea and Iran. \u201c(Then) we were cooperating with the Russians on both of these fronts \u2026 we were meeting, we had the same objectives \u2026 and the Chinese were with us on lockstep on both of those accounts,\u201d McFaul said in a podcast last month hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank. \u201cNow look at where we\u2019re at today, completely the opposite \u2026 we\u2019re not cooperating at all on either of those accounts \u2026 that is a brand-new world and a tragic world.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/china/north-korea-russia-putin-kim-visit-ukraine-analysis-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "world"}}

It\u2019s not the only area of tropical concern looming large this week as a predicted hyperactive hurricane season kicks into gear. The system threatening the southwestern Gulf Coast has been designated Potential Tropical Cyclone One by the National Hurricane Center as it tries to get organized in the Gulf of Mexico. It will unload torrential rainfall and considerably ramp up the flood threat, not just in the US, but also in parts of Mexico and Central America. As the name suggests, Potential Tropical Cyclone One isn\u2019t quite a tropical storm yet, but is expected to become one and poses a threat to the areas in the tropical storm warning over the next 48 hours. The system had 40 mph winds Tuesday morning \u2013 strong enough that if it does develop a coherent circulation, it would be named Tropical Storm Alberto. It\u2019s forecast to by late Tuesday or Wednesday before approaching the northern coast of Mexico on Wednesday night. The system\u2019s strength will be limited by its short time over water, but it\u2019s main threat of significant rain and flooding will not: multiple days of gushing rainfall for parts of Central America, southern Mexico\u00a0and the US western Gulf Coast. Heavy rain was already ongoing Monday in parts of Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, El Salvador and Honduras as the gyre churned. Double-digit rainfall totals are possible in these areas by Thursday. Rain is needed desperately in parts of Mexico and Central America that are bone-dry after weeks of unrelenting heat. But day after day of heavy rain will quickly overwhelm parched soils unable to absorb water as fast as it falls, resulting in dangerous flooding. Deep tropical moisture was also fueling storms as far north as the US\u2019s western Gulf Coast. Double-digit rainfall totals are likely in portions of coastal and southern Texas by the weekend, while other portions of the Gulf Coast could pick up several inches through midweek. A level 3 of 4 risk of flooding rainfall is in place for the Texas coast Tuesday and much of South Texas on Wednesday. By Wednesday, the air over the Gulf Coast will be loaded up with \u201cincredible amounts of moisture\u201d which could \u201ceasily\u201d produce flash flooding, the Weather Prediction Center warned Monday. Heavy rain isn\u2019t the most welcome sight along some parts of the US Gulf Coast. June has been drier after a drenching spring, but the soil and area rivers are still holding on to plenty of water in eastern Texas and western Louisiana. Another tropical threat could take shape Another tropical threat is stirring in the Atlantic as development gets underway in the Gulf of Mexico. An area of showers and thunderstorms a few hundred miles east of the Bahamas could be the starting point for a potential tropical system later this week. Right now, the National Hurricane Center gives it a low chance of developing into a tropical system. Multiple atmospheric factors must align for the area of stormy weather to get its act together, but the opportunity for development exists over the next few days as it slowly pushes westward. If something tropical does develop, it could approach the southeastern US by Thursday or Friday and be steered south of the heat dome roasting areas farther north. It\u2019s unclear exactly which areas could be impacted, but anywhere from Florida to the Carolinas should keep a close eye on the forecast as it comes into focus in the coming days. Drenching rain could soak parts of the Southeast coast and rough seas are possible from the Bahamas to the mid-Atlantic coasts regardless of development.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/weather/hurricane-season-gulf-coast-flooding/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_23_uk_uk-election-explainer-sunak-starmer-gbr-intl", "text": "Britain\u2019s Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has taken the biggest gamble of his troubled premiership by calling an early general election that almost everyone in Westminster believes he will lose. We\u2019ll know on 4 July whether the decision was a masterstroke or a misfire. If, as current polls indicate, the opposition Labour party triumph, it will finally bring down the curtain of a 14-year era of Conservative rule, ushering in a center-left government led by former barrister Keir Starmer. Any other outcome would mean Sunak has orchestrated a shocking victory that even many in his own party believe is beyond reach \u2013 and would result in the Conservatives extending a political dynasty towards a third decade. Here are some key questions answered. Why did Sunak call an election now \u2013 and is it a gamble? Sunak was obliged to call an election by December and hold it by the following month, but until that deadline \u2013 five years on from the last vote \u2013 the decision of when to stage a poll is in the gift of the prime minister. Sunak told journalists at a drinks reception in December that it would be in 2024, not January 2025, and has more recently said his \u201cassumption\u201d is that it would happen in the second half of the year \u2013 which 4 July is, just about. But beyond those clues, he has been tight-lipped while he weighed his options \u2013 feeding frenzied speculation in Westminster for months. The main problem facing him is that no good options existed. Sunak is down around 20 points in opinion polls, and that deficit hasn\u2019t budged all year. The economy is gloomy, and one line of thinking among his aides is that waiting until October or November would give it time to settle. But on the other hand, Sunak has placed much of his political capital into his pledge to stop small boat crossings to the UK by asylum seekers. He has recently passed a controversial law to process some claims in Rwanda, though nobody has yet been deported and further legal challenges may await the plan. Meanwhile, the warmer summer months are expected to see a huge number of such journeys across the English Channel, hurting a major pillar of his campaign message. Ultimately, hours after some rare good economic news \u2013 a healthy month-on-month reduction in the rate of inflation \u2013 Sunak decided that this was the least bad time to pull the trigger. Who\u2019s expected to win? The near-universal expectation is that Sunak\u2019s Conservative Party will lose the election. Labour have been leading in general election opinion polls since late 2021, and that lead has been huge for the entirety of Sunak\u2019s premiership and through the first weeks of the campaign. They are around 20 points up on average, with the Tories closer to third party challengers Reform UK and the Liberal Democrats than they are to Labour. When converted to a projection of seats in parliament, those figures indicate either a comfortable Labour win or a Labour win so huge it would spell a near-wipeout for the Conservatives. The Conservative brand was damaged by Partygate and a number of other scandals that led to the demise of Boris Johnson\u2019s premiership, and then the shambolic six-week tenure of his successor Liz Truss, whose fiscal agenda sent markets into turmoil. But for Sunak\u2019s team, some deeper numbers provide some slim comfort. While Keir Starmer leads Sunak in polling on the question of who would make a better prime minister, that lead is much smaller than the overall party voting gap \u2013 and Sunak has sought to keep the focus on a \u201cme versus him\u201d message. Nonetheless, Sunak hasn\u2019t been able to move the polls in his favor since he became leader, and they have not narrowed since the campaign began. In recent days, even some of his own Cabinet ministers have shifted their message, encouraging supporters instead to prevent a massive Labour majority than to send Sunak back to Downing Street. What happens now? The parties are halfway through a six-week dash around the country, eagerly getting pictured knocking on doors, standing in hi-vis jackets and meeting members of the public. Two head-to-head TV debates have been organized; in the first, Sunak and Starmer scrapped in a tense and occasionally personal tie. The second will air in late June. Then on Thursday, July 4, Britons will vote between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m. local time, and as soon as polls close, votes will be counted. A winner is usually declared in the early hours of Friday morning. Who is Keir Starmer? Rishi Sunak\u2019s rival for power is Labour leader Keir Starmer, who is heavily favored to become Britain\u2019s new prime minister in July. A former, well-respected human rights lawyer who then served as Britain\u2019s most senior prosecutor, Starmer came into politics late in life. He became a Labour MP in 2015 and less than five years later was the party\u2019s leader, following a stint as shadow Brexit Secretary during Britain\u2019s protracted exit from the European Union. Starmer inherited a party reeling from its worst electoral defeat in generations, but he prioritized an overhaul of its culture \u2013 staring down left-wing supporters of former leader Jeremy Corbyn, and apologizing publicly for a long-running antisemitism scandal that had tainted the group\u2019s standing with the public. He has attempted to lay claim to Britain\u2019s political center ground, and is described by his supporters as a principled, serious leader with a focus on tackling the systemic issues facing Britain. But his opponents, on both the left of his own party and the right of the political spectrum, say he lacks charisma and ideas, and charge that he has failed to set out an ambitious and broad vision for the nation. Who else is standing? Only Sunak or Starmer have a realistic chance of becoming prime minister, but their plans could be disrupted by a number of smaller parties. Nigel Farage, the populist right-wing figurehead who leads Reform UK, announced he would stand for election early in the campaign \u2013 he previously declined to do so, in order to help former President Donald Trump campaign in the US election this fall \u2013 and his entry has helped the group peel away Tory support. Farage has criticized Sunak\u2019s record on migration, and his group has pulled close to the Tories in many polls. Holding on to that level of support come election day could cause a once-in-a-lifetime decimation of the Tories at the ballot box. Meanwhile, as Farage attacks Sunak from the right, the Liberal Democrats, a centrist, pro-European group, have chipped away at Conservative support in affluent, southern parts of England. Given Labour\u2019s standing in the polls, Starmer is more equipped to take the fight to other groups. North of the border, he will look to end the Scottish National Party (SNP)\u2019s generation-long dominance at the ballot box, capitalizing on a rocky period in the party\u2019s recent history that has seen them replace two leaders in just over a year. But he will need to be mindful of the Green Party, which has challenged him from the left and has attracted some younger liberal votes as a result. In recent local elections, there was evidence too that Labour\u2019s stance on Israel\u2019s war against Hamas in Gaza had harmed the party in majority-Muslim areas. How does voting work? In the UK, voters don\u2019t elect a prime minister directly. Instead, they elect a member of parliament (MP) to represent their local constituency. The leader of the party that wins a majority of the UK\u2019s 650 constituencies automatically becomes prime minister, and can form a government. That means 326 is the magic number for an overall majority. If there\u2019s no majority, they need to look for help elsewhere, ruling as a minority government \u2013 as Theresa May did after a close 2017 result \u2013 or forming a coalition, as David Cameron did after 2010. The monarch has an important role; King Charles III must approve the formation of a government, the decision to hold an election and the dissolution of parliament. But this is a formal role only; the King won\u2019t contradict his prime minister or overrule the results of an election. What issues will decide the election? The answer to that question will go some way in deciding the night\u2019s winner. Labour will be keen to define the election as a referendum on 14 years of Conservative rule,  seizing on public fatigue with a party that has produced five prime ministers in that span and overseen Brexit, a stuttering economy and a series of sleaze scandals. In particular, Starmer will talk plenty about the cost of living hitting British families, and the state of the country\u2019s overstaffed and stretched National Health Service (NHS). Sunak, by contrast, will want to focus on migration \u2013 his pledge to \u201cStop the Boats\u201d hasn\u2019t yet worked, but his flagship Rwanda policy has at least become law. And he will attempt to convince voters that the economy has turned a corner, and can\u2019t risk a change in governance. Early signs also show he is attempting to make the question of leadership central in voters\u2019 minds \u2013 highlighting his time as finance minister during the Covid-19 pandemic in his first speech, and criticizing Starmer\u2019s record.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/uk/uk-election-explainer-sunak-starmer-gbr-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_tech_apple-ai-data-openai-artificial-intelligence", "text": "Apple\u2019s splashy announcement at its Worldwide Developers Conference this week that it\u2019s adding artificial intelligence to its products, and partnering with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, has raised many questions about how Apple\u2019s AI offerings will work. The confusion is understandable. Apple is simultaneously launching a proprietary suite of AI models while also integrating ChatGPT into its devices and software. So it\u2019s natural to wonder where one ends and the other begins and \u2014 perhaps more pressingly \u2014 what both companies will do with the personal information they receive from users. The stakes are particularly high for Apple, a company that has made security and privacy a hallmark of its brand. Here\u2019s what we know. The difference between Apple Intelligence and ChatGPT If Apple has its own AI, why does it need ChatGPT? The answer is that each is meant to do different things. Apple Intelligence \u2014 the collective brand name for all of Apple\u2019s own AI tools \u2014 is intended to be more of a personal assistant than anything else, with an emphasis on \u201cpersonal.\u201d It takes in specific information about your relationships and contacts, messages and emails you\u2019ve sent, events you\u2019ve been to, meetings on your calendar and other highly individualized bits of data about your life. And then it uses that data to, Apple hopes, make your life a little easier \u2014 helping you dig up a photo you took from that concert years ago, finding the right attachment to put on an email, or ranking your mobile notifications by priority and urgency. But while Apple Intelligence might know that you went on a hiking trip last year, it will lack what company executives called \u201cworld knowledge\u201d \u2014 more general information about history, current events and other things that are less directly linked to you. That\u2019s where ChatGPT comes in. Users will be able to have Siri forward questions and prompts to ChatGPT \u2014\u00a0on an opt-in basis \u2014 or have ChatGPT help you write documents within Apple apps. Apple said it plans to integrate with other third-party AI models eventually, too. The integration essentially removes a step to accessing ChatGPT and gives Apple users a more seamless onramp to that platform. What does this mean for my data? Since Apple Intelligence and ChatGPT will be used for largely different purposes, the amount and type of information users send to each AI may be different, too. Apple Intelligence will have access to a wide range of your personal data, from your written communications to photos and videos you\u2019ve taken to a record of your calendar events. There doesn\u2019t seem to be a way to prevent Apple Intelligence from accessing this information, short of not using its features; an Apple spokesperson didn\u2019t immediately respond to questions on that topic. ChatGPT won\u2019t necessarily or automatically have access to your highly personal details, although you might choose to share some of this data and more with OpenAI if you decide to use ChatGPT through Apple. In Monday\u2019s demo, Apple showed Siri asking the user for permission to send a prompt to ChatGPT before doing so. As part of its agreement with Apple, OpenAI made an important concession: OpenAI agreed not to store any prompts from Apple users or to collect their IP addresses \u2014 though all bets are off if you consciously decide to log in and connect an existing ChatGPT account. Some users might\u00a0choose to do\u00a0that\u00a0to take advantage of their ChatGPT history or the benefits associated with ChatGPT\u2019s paid account plans. Should you trust Apple with your data? Now that we\u2019ve established what OpenAI will and won\u2019t do with your data, what about Apple? While Apple users will have to send their personal information and AI queries to OpenAI if they want to use ChatGPT, Apple has said that most of the time Apple Intelligence won\u2019t be sending user data anywhere. As much as possible, Apple will try to process AI prompts directly on your device using smaller AI models. This is similar to how Apple already processes FaceID and other sensitive data \u2014 the idea being that processing data right on the device limits risky exposure. Your data can\u2019t be intercepted or hacked from a central server if it never actually goes anywhere. In the event your AI task needs more processing power, Apple Intelligence will send your query and data to a cloud computing platform controlled by Apple, where a more capable AI model will fulfill the request. This is where Apple claims it has achieved a major privacy breakthrough. The company\u2019s announcement received relatively little airtime during its jam-packed Monday keynote but the company is plainly proud of the advancement it\u2019s clearly been extensively planning. Apple said Monday it has developed a new way to do cloud computing that means Apple can run computations on sensitive data while ensuring that nobody, not even the company itself, can tell what data is being processed or what computation is being done. Known as Private Cloud Compute, Apple\u2019s new architecture borrows certain hardware and security concepts from the iPhone, including the secure enclave that already protects sensitive user data on Apple mobile devices. With Private Cloud Compute, \u201cyour data is never stored or made accessible to Apple,\u201d said Craig Federighi, Apple\u2019s SVP of software engineering, during Monday\u2019s keynote. After fulfilling a user\u2019s AI request, Private Cloud Compute scrubs itself of any user data involved in the process, Apple said. Apple claims Private Cloud Compute\u00a0is \u201conly possible\u201d because of the tight control it has over its entire technology ecosystem \u2014 from the specialized, proprietary computer chips to the software tying everything together. If it\u2019s true that Apple can\u2019t see the personal data that its large AI models are crunching \u2014 a claim Apple invited researchers to test for themselves because the system\u2019s design is meant to be scrutinized \u2014 then that sets Apple\u2019s implementation apart from that of other companies. For example, when you use ChatGPT, OpenAI discloses that it uses your data to further train its AI models. With Private Cloud Compute, you theoretically won\u2019t have to take Apple\u2019s word that it doesn\u2019t use your data for AI training. What about Apple\u2019s training data? Apple\u2019s AI models didn\u2019t spring up out of nowhere. They had to be trained, too, just like models offered by other companies. And that raises questions about whose data Apple used, and how. In a technical document released this week, Apple said its models are trained \u201con licensed data, including data selected to enhance specific features.\u201d \u201cWe never use our users\u2019 private personal data or user interactions when training our foundation models,\u201d the company added, \u201cand we apply filters to remove personally identifiable information like social security and credit card numbers that are publicly available on the Internet.\u201d Apple did, however, admit to scraping the public internet for data that then went into training its proprietary models, making it somewhat similar to other AI companies, some of whom have faced copyright lawsuits and sparked a debate over whether AI startups have unfairly profited off the work of humans. Apple hasn\u2019t said what web-based information it has ingested. It did say that publishers can add code to their sites to prevent Apple\u2019s web crawler from collecting their data. But that places the burden squarely on publishers to safeguard their own intellectual property, not the company.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/tech/apple-ai-data-openai-artificial-intelligence/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_style_brooke-shields-crocs-tony-awards-red-carpet", "text": "Many celebrities will be well-versed in the power of the statement heel to complete a red carpet look, but at the Tony Awards on Sunday night in New York, Brooke Shields stole the spotlight in a statement flat. Stepping out in a pair of sunny Crocs to match her bright yellow Monique Lhuillier gown, the star made absolutely zero apologies for the sure-to-be controversial footwear choice, playfully lifting her dress to reveal to reporters she had indeed traded in heels for practical clogs. \u201cI\u2019ve got two theatre-loving shoes on,\u201d she told the Associated Press. Shields further explained that she had foot surgery several days before the event. \u201cBroadway gave me these broken feet, and now I\u2019m fixing them,\u201d the actor, who has starred in theater productions like \u201cChicago,\u201d \u201cCabaret\u201d and \u201cGrease,\u201d told CBS, As a former face of Calvin Klein, Shields has never been far from fashion\u2019s inner circle and has become synonymous with \u201call-American,\u201d timeless style. Her latest sartorial choice on is seemingly in line with what the actor has called her \u201cf*ck it era,\u201d according to Glamour magazine. Shields, 59, speaks regularly about the confidence she has found as she has gotten older. \u201cI\u2019m so excited about this age and era of life because I\u2019m less complicated, less insecure, less egomaniacal, and I\u2019m focusing on that,\u201d she recently told Vogue. Chunky, with signature Swiss cheese holes and often in jarringly bright colors; since their debut in 2004, Crocs have divided opinion \u2014 and often been derided by fashion insiders and experts. But the clogs, made of a special resin called Croslite, are loved by comfort-seekers, and they do have a track record with celebrities too. Singer Justin Bieber paired an oversized Balenciaga suit with platform Crocs to the 2022 Grammys (his own clothing brand Drew House has collaborated with the label in the past), while record producer Questlove wore a shiny golden pair to the 2021 Oscars. Even as far back as 2015, actor Alan Cumming (pictured above) sported Crocs to the Emmys with his Vivienne Westwood ensemble. Founded in Boulder, Colorado by three friends in 2002, Crocs were an immediate success when they first hit the market. By 2007 the company was selling 50 million pairs a year. But the 2008 financial crisis and a saturated market saw the company go from $200 million in profit in 2007 to $200 million in losses the next year. In recent years, the company has teamed up with brands and celebrities to release special editions. There was a glow-in-the-dark collaboration with Puerto Rican musician Bad Bunny in 2020, which sold out soon after its release, a lime green crossover with Dreamwork\u2019s \u201cShrek\u201d in 2023 and a long-running partnership with Balenciaga that\u2019s yielded an assortment of Crocs boots, stilettos, and platforms. These efforts may be paying off: Crocs reported a record year of earnings in 2023, with total revenue reaching nearly $4 billion dollars. Will they become a red carpet mainstay? Probably not, but Shields\u2019 outfit did garner plenty of support from her fans on social media: \u201cYou\u2019re a trend setter and a very cool one at that!\u201d wrote one commenter below the actor\u2019s Instagram post showing off her Crocs. \u201cWe are utterly obsessed,\u201d said another. Worn with such confidence, could more female celebrities follow suit?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/style/brooke-shields-crocs-tony-awards-red-carpet/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "world"}}
