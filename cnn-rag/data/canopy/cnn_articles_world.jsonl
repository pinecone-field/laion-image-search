And at next month\u2019s upcoming Games, Louis Vuitton are hoping they too will become a hallmark of the same grand occasion. The luxury house\u2019s distinctive Damier checkerboard trunks will house the Olympic torch as it travels across France, and Vuitton has created medal cases for the Olympic and Paralympic Games. Seven French athletes \u2014 from fencer Enzo Lefort and swimmer L\u00e9on Marchand to wheelchair tennis champion Pauline D\u00e9roul\u00e8de and para-cyclist Marie Patouillet \u2014 will also act as ambassadors for the brand. The Olympics, and the extraordinary journeys that athletes take to reach them, closely align with the values at the heart of the French luxury fashion house, its chairman and CEO Pietro Beccari told CNN in an interview at the brand\u2019s headquarters in Paris. \u201cWe talk about excellence, we spoke about quality, we spoke about being prepared for every challenge, and that is something that is very close to our heart,\u201d Beccari said, adding that Louis Vuitton is \u201cvery proud to be a French group\u201d and willing to support its home Olympics in the \u201cmost beautiful city in the world.\u201d As one would expect from a company who also designs the trophy trunks for such events as the soccer World Cup and the F1 Grand Prix de Monaco, these are no ordinary pieces of luggage. The interiors of both trunks are lined with matte black leather; one featuring circular \u201csockets\u201d in its base and lid to safely house and transport the Olympic torch, while the other contains enough drawers to store hundreds of medals. LVMH \u2013 the luxury conglomerate that owns Louis Vuitton \u2013 spent \u20ac150 million ($163 million) on its sponsorship deal with the Olympics, Vogue reported citing sources, though calculating the precise returns on this investment is \u201cdifficult,\u201d said Beccari.  \u201cWe believe this campaign is building values, building desirability,\u201d he said. \u201cQuantifying it is very difficult, not that we didn\u2019t try but it\u2019s very very difficult or impossible.\u201d The fashion house has long associated itself with sport, sponsoring nautical events like the Americas Cup, as well as launching a recent campaign centered around the friendship of tennis legends Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. \u201cWe are very close to sport,\u201d Beccari said, recalling the slogan \u201cVictory travels in Louis Vuitton,\u201d the fashion house used when one of its trunks housed the FIFA World Cup in 2010. \u201cI think it incarnates very well the DNA of Louis Vuitton, of what I was saying before, the challenges, the willingness to overcome yourself, to reach your destination and to be willing to go and discover more.\u201d This messaging underpinned a new campaign with Federer and Nadal sitting on a Louis Vuitton case on a snowy mountain in the Dolomites, discussing their rivalry, their biggest achievements and their sporting heroes. They\u2019re \u201ctwo beautiful young people that started from their little villages respectively in two different parts of Europe,\u201d Beccari said, \u201cand they became who they became so it\u2019s really part of this philosophy of excellence, of quality, of envy to surpass yourself over time again.\u201d While Louis Vuitton posted record profits last year and LVMH outperformed other luxury brands, the current economic environment with rising inflation leaving consumers with less disposable income poses challenges ahead, though Beccari downplayed such difficulties. \u201cIn terms of crisis, you always have to have the courage to see the opportunities and that\u2019s what we do,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there is a curve, and we like to do the curve with speed, so when the road will be straight again we\u2019ll have sufficient speed to be ahead of the others.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/style/louis-vuitton-pietro-beccari-olympics/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/09/2024", "section": "world"}}

The announcement comes after US President Joe Biden unveiled executive action that would bar people who cross the US-Mexico border illegally from requesting asylum, during periods when there is a high volume of illegal crossings. Unless they meet certain exemptions, the asylum-seekers would be turned away to Mexico or returned to their home countries. The\u00a0president\u2019s proclamation, announced Tuesday, still allows for the normal flow of commerce and legal immigration across the border. Asked whether Biden\u2019s plan could lead to a potential increase of migrants on the Mexican side of the border, Mexico\u2019s president said, \u201cWe are seeking an agreement that if they (the US) make the decision to deport, they do so directly.\u201d L\u00f3pez Obrador added that he is not worried about Mexican border towns being overwhelmed by asylum seekers pushed back by the US. \u201cThey come to Mexico. We have no problem. We treat them all very well (\u2026) but why not a direct agreement?\u201d he said. Biden and L\u00f3pez Obrador also held a phone call on Tuesday, which the Mexican president described as \u201crespectful\u201d and \u201cvery amicable,\u201d saying they spoke about the need to support Latin American nations. A \u2018virtual wall\u2019 While some critics argue Biden\u2019s sweeping migration measure\u00a0doesn\u2019t go far enough in responding to the large numbers of people showing up at the US southern border, others warn that closing the\u00a0border\u00a0to\u00a0asylum\u00a0seekers\u00a0will endanger vulnerable people. In practice, the new rule would imply \u201cclosing the border\u201d to the thousands of refugees who are in Mexico waiting to reach the United States, Tonatiuh Guill\u00e9n, professor at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) and former commissioner of the National Migration Institute of Mexico, told CNN. \u201cIt implies a kind of virtual wall because people are going to be in a scenario where they are going to be rejected. On the other hand, if this measure is implemented, it leaves thousands of people without the possibility of shelter,\u201d Guillen said. Mexican authorities have largely played down any expected impact. A source at Mexico\u2019s asylum commission COMAR also told CNN that the agency is not very concerned about a potential increase in refugee applications \u201cbecause normally, the migrants who reached the northern border of Mexico are not interested in requesting asylum in Mexico.\u201d L\u00f3pez Obrador said what he \u201cliked the most\u201d about his call with Biden was the US\u2019 plan to build three new border bridges. \u201cThis is going to help a lot in the economic and commercial development throughout the region,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/americas/mexicos-us-deportation-country-of-origin-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/09/2024", "section": "world"}}

And now, as stars Nicola Coughlan and Luke Newton, who play love interests Penelope Featherington and Colin Bridgerton (Polin, to the shippers), promote the remaining episodes, Coughlan is pulling out all the sartorial stops to match the romance of the season. At the Toronto red-carpet premiere earlier this week, Coughlan stepped out in a structured lavender mini dress rippling with petal-like silk organza, paired with a voluminous red gathered cloak fit for early 19th-century yearning. The couture ensemble is by designer Sara Mrad and served as another example of Coughlan\u2019s stylist, Aim\u00e9e Croysdill, playing up the Irish actress\u2019s curves with exaggerated silhouettes. Coughlan has long been admired for her bold red-carpet looks \u2014 including her debut at the Met Gala in 2022 in an extravagant pink and black Richard Quinn ball gown \u2014 but she\u2019s amplified her style on her \u201cBridgerton\u201d press tour. In April, she glimmered at a London event in a sculptural 22-karat gold-plated corset by MISHO that featured an anatomical heart. Last month, she wore a dramatic white peplum hourglass gown by Danielle Frankel to the New York premiere. (Nearly all her looks have also been accessorized with a red pin that signals her support for a ceasefire in Palestine, too). This season has been a milestone for her character Penelope, who takes the spotlight at court, and Coughlan. As the former \u201cDerry Girls\u201d actor has stepped into the role of leading lady, she\u2019s intentional about how she wants to be portrayed. \u201cThere\u2019s one scene where I\u2019m very naked on camera, and that was my idea, my choice. It just felt like the biggest \u2018f*** you\u2019 to all the conversation surrounding my body; it was amazingly empowering,\u201d she told Stylist magazine earlier this year, which was reported on by BuzzFeed. And though Coughlan\u2019s power dressing can speak for itself, the actor has been candid with her fans about what\u2019s appropriate and what isn\u2019t, writing on Instagram earlier this year that \u201cit\u2019s really hard to take the weight of thousands of opinions on how you look being sent directly to you every day.\u201d But she\u2019s also responded with wit that rivals Penelope\u2019s. At the Dublin premiere, she was asked about her \u201cbravery\u201d in showing her body on screen. She replied: \u201cYou know it is hard because I think women with my body type \u2013\u2014 women with perfect breasts \u2014 don\u2019t get to see ourselves on screen enough.\u201d \u201cI hope you enjoy them,\u201d she added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/style/nicola-coughlan-bridgerton-lotw/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/09/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_weather_tornado-maryland-dc", "text": "Damaging storms and tornadoes hit parts of at least three states, including a Washington, DC, suburb Wednesday, killing at least one person and injuring others. A tornado ripped through the Detroit suburb of Livonia, Michigan, during the afternoon and toppled a tree onto a home, killing a 2-year-old and severely injuring the child\u2019s mother. \u201cThis is a terrible tragedy for our community,\u201d Livonia Mayor Maureen Miller Brosnan said in a\u00a0news release. \u201cOur hearts are broken, too, and we send our deepest sympathies.\u201d The storm that tracked through Livonia tore a 5.5-mile path and was rated an EF1 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale, with peak winds of 95 mph, according to a preliminary survey from the National Weather Service in Detroit.  Storms intensified as they tracked through West Virginia and Maryland Wednesday evening and produced more than 10 reports of tornadoes in the two states. A tornado tracking through the Washington, DC, suburb of Gaithersburg, Maryland, trapped five people in a ranch-style home after it collapsed in the storm. One person was taken to a hospital with traumatic injuries, Montgomery County Fire and Rescue Assistant Chief David Pazos told CNN. Two other homes in the densely packed suburb with about 70,000 residents were significantly damaged by trees, according to the fire department\u2019s chief spokesperson Pete Piringer. Several people were removed from damaged structures and transported to hospitals, emergency officials said. At least seven tornadoes have been confirmed in the Baltimore area, with notable tornadoes in both Montgomery\u00a0County and Baltimore County receiving EF1 ratings after reaching winds of 105 mph, the National Weather Service said. A tornado was also seen near Baltimore, in Arbutus, Maryland at around 8:55 p.m. ET, the National Weather Service office there said. Details about what damage that tornado caused, if any, to structures were not immediately available. The US Storm Prediction Center said numerous trees and power lines were down in the area. In the Sykesville, Maryland, area, there were no immediate reports of injuries but at least 10 structures were damaged, mostly by the high winds, according to fire department spokesperson Bill Rehkopf. One was significantly damaged by a tree. Survey teams with the National Weather Service are visiting the hard-hit areas to assess the damage to determine how many tornadoes there were and how strong they were. Weak tornadoes are not uncommon in the DC region, but only a handful in recorded history have been EF3 or stronger. In 2002, an EF4 tornado devastated parts of La Plata, Maryland, south of DC. That storm killed three people and caused more than $100 million in damage, according to data from the National Weather Service. Tornadoes were also seen in Alabama and Ohio as storms across the country exceeded forecast expectations. A possible tornado also caused damage in Frazeysburg, Ohio, around 50 miles east of Columbus. Photos show debris littered streets, snapped power poles and some partially collapsed structures. Nine people were injured, including at least four taken to a nearby hospital, according to CNN affiliate WBNS.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/weather/tornado-maryland-dc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/09/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_04_19_style_graham-sutherland-winston-churchill-portrait", "text": "\u201cThat is not a painting, it\u2019s a humiliation!\u201d Winston Churchill (played by John Lithgow) angrily tells the renowned painter Graham Sutherland (actor Stephen Dillane) in the first season of \u201cThe Crown,\u201d Netflix\u2019s six-series dramatization about the English monarchy. Churchill is talking about his own portrait, commissioned to celebrate his 80th birthday, as it is unveiled in London\u2019s Westminster Hall in November 1954. Churchill goes on to describe his appearance in the painting as \u201ca broken, sagging, pitiful creature,\u201d Sutherland as \u201ca Judas wielding his murderous brush,\u201d and concludes the whole work is \u201ca betrayal of friendship, and an unpatriotic, treacherous, cowardly assault by the individualistic left!\u201d The episode ends with Churchill\u2019s wife Clementine (played by Harriet Walter) watching it burn on a bonfire outside their home. Evidently, he was not a fan. While \u201cThe Crown\u201d is not a documentary, it is true that the 80th birthday portrait \u2014described by Churchill as \u201cfilthy and malignant\u201d in a letter to his personal doctor \u2014 was burned. \u201cI think he was quite vain about his image,\u201d Andre Zlattinger, Deputy Chairman UK and Head of Modern British & Irish Art at Sotheby\u2019s, explained during a press briefing. \u201cHe\u2019d had a stroke in 1953 so for him (how he was perceived) was important at that time. He\u2019d won the election in 1951 by a narrow margin, and there was quite a lot of debate about him and his leadership.\u201d While the painting itself was destroyed, a painted study of Churchill \u2014 created by Sutherland in preparation for the infamous birthday portrait \u2014 had been on display at the UK\u2019s Blenheim Palace in April, in the room where Churchill was born 150 years ago. Sutherland gave the study to his friend Alfred Hecht, who kept it for the rest of his life before gifting it to the current owner.\u00a0After its stint at the palace, it travelled to Sotheby\u2019s in New York and London ahead of it\u2019s first ever auction on June 6, where it fetched \u00a3660,000 ($842,490); lower than it\u2019s estimate of \u00a3800,000 ($1,024,000), but still the second highest price for a portrait of Churchill. \u201c(Sutherland) caught him in a much more relaxed, intimate way,\u201d Zlattinger said of the study, a small canvas painted in oils. \u201cIt\u2019s a very different depiction to the (later) painting which obviously Churchill didn\u2019t like and was later destroyed.\u201d Controlling the narrative Churchill was far from the only leader to micromanage his image, though; rulers have been controlling and falsifying their images for centuries. Sculptures of Ancient Egyptian pharaohs were stylized in ways to demonstrate their power. The female pharaoh Hatshepsut of the Eighteenth Dynasty diverted from reality completely by having herself depicted with a male torso. In the UK, Queen Elizabeth I is perhaps the most obvious example of a ruler distorting their image. Robert Blyth, Senior Curator of World and Maritime History at Royal Museums Greenwich, told CNN that after her 40s Elizabeth \u201csimply didn\u2019t age\u201d. In The Rainbow Portrait, one of her most famous paintings, any wrinkles a woman in her 60s might have had are carefully smoothed over. Queen Victoria, crowned more than 250 years after Elizabeth, also used painting to disguise her age, though the academic Ira B. Nadel wrote that her interest in photography eventually made her \u201cintolerant of idealized or inaccurate portraits.\u201d Blyth explains that, like Churchill, \u201ca touch of vanity\u201d drove monarchs\u2019 tightly controlled image; \u201cWho would want to have their portrait painted and look exactly as they do?\u201d, he joked.\u202fHowever, leaders also needed to provide political stability. Elizabeth I was \u201cthe end of the Tudor line\u201d, Blyth noted. \u201cThe idea of her image reflecting any frailty would have caused suspicion.\u201d Dr Caroline Rae, an associate lecturer in History of Art at University College London, agreed. \u201cIt was a period of big changes, people being beheaded,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cMortality is something which causes instability. (Elizabeth) knows things are maybe not as stable as one might think. She\u2019s in a precarious position.\u201d Altering public perceptions Churchill himself faced political precarity. An already tumultuous career landed him in Downing Street during the Second World War, but he was voted out almost as soon as it was over. He did become Prime Minister for a second time in 1951, but his Conservative Party only had a 17-seat majority and, in April 1955, six months after the birthday portrait debacle, Churchill resigned over ill health. \u201cThere was the Suez crisis happening, and Stalin had died in 1953, so there was a lot of stuff going on,\u201d Zlattinger said. \u201cHis health and political position at that time contributed to him being particularly controlling about how that portrait was created and perceived,\u201d Bryn Sayles, Head of Sale, Modern & Post-War British Art at Sotheby\u2019s, told CNN. \u201cBut even on earlier commissions, Churchill was quite famously a very tricky sitter and wanted to be depicted in a particular way. For instance, he made sculptor Jacob Epstein take out a bit of flab from underneath his chin (in a work), so from the beginning, Churchill understood the importance of his image as a politician and was very clear about how he felt that image should be presented to the public.\u201d Historic photographs of the UK\u2019s royal family were also regularly altered, however, not everyone was happy about it. Swiss historian Alexis Schwarzenbach reported that Queen Elizabeth, wife of King George VI and mother of Queen Elizabeth II, returned her 50th birthday photo to photographer Cecil Beaton in 1950, with instructions to reduce the amount of retouching done to her lips and chin. Just four years later, Churchill\u2019s very different reaction to his own \u2018imperfections\u2019 led to the scene now immortalized in \u201cThe Crown\u201d \u2014 a factor which Sayles explains has ironically piqued buyers\u2019 interests in owning his portraits. \u201cAfter \u201cThe Crown\u201d episode and Gary Oldman\u2019s portrayal of Churchill in the \u201cDarkest Hour\u201d movie, we literally had new collectors coming in the market looking for Churchill paintings because there was a renewed interest in him.\u201d While Churchill certainly would not have appreciated fresh attention on his hated portrait, buyers appetite for the study proves that the legacy of one of the UK\u2019s most famous leaders is far from over yet.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/19/style/graham-sutherland-winston-churchill-portrait/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/09/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_08_middleeast_four-israeli-hostages-freed-gaza-intl", "text": "The Israeli military rescued four hostages in a special operation in the Nuseirat refugee camp, central Gaza, that Gazan authorities said killed 236 people and injured more than 400 others. Noa Argamani, Almog Meir Jan, Andrey Kozlov, and Shlomi Ziv, were rescued by the Israeli military, intelligence and special forces from two separate locations in Nuseirat, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Saturday. All four were kidnapped from the Nova music festival on October 7. \u201cThey are in good medical condition and have been transferred to the \u2018Sheba\u2019 Tel-HaShomer Medical Center for further medical examinations,\u201d the IDF added. An\u00a0Israeli\u00a0policeman from a special\u00a0counter-terrorism\u00a0unit was killed in Saturday\u2019s rescue operation, according to\u00a0Israeli\u00a0police. News of the rescue came soon after Israel\u2019s military said it was operating in Nuseirat and other areas of central Gaza, where heavy shelling and artillery fire was reported. At least 236 people have been killed as a result of the rescue operation and more than 400 injured, hospital officials in Gaza said Saturday. The killed and wounded were taken to two hospitals in Gaza, Al-Awda Hospital in Nuseirat and Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir Al-Balah. Al-Awda Hospital director Dr Marwan Abu Nasser told CNN that 142 bodies had been counted at the medical facility by late Saturday, while Al-Aqsa Hospital in Deir al-Balah said 94 bodies had been counted. CNN has no way of verifying casualty numbers reported by Palestinian officials in Gaza. Medical records in the war-torn enclave do not differentiate between civilians and militants killed. An Israeli military spokesperson put the number of casualties from the operation at \u201cunder 100,\u201d and had no information on how many of those were civilians. Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said Israeli forces had to enter civilian areas to reach hostages as this was where Hamas had embedded itself. He said the hostages had been locked in two separate apartments in civilian multi-story buildings about 200 meters (650 feet) apart, with Argamani held in a different building to the three males. He said the IDF had received intelligence on their location beforehand, noting that hostages in Gaza were frequently moved around and Argamani had previously been held elsewhere. Similar raids had been called off at the last minute \u201cmore than three or four times\u201d due to unfavorable conditions, he added. The first phase of Saturday\u2019s operation saw the IDF target militant infrastructure with pre-planned strikes, Hagari said. For the rescue, the IDF had opted for a daytime operation because of the element of surprise, he added, and it had prepared by building models of the apartments the hostages were held in. Hagari said that the IDF had come under intense fire, especially after withdrawing from the apartments, but did not provide evidence for his claims. Saturday was an \u201cemotional and happy day for the state of Israel and the IDF,\u201d Hagari said, though he cautioned that most of the remaining hostages were not being held in conditions that would allow for similar operations. Following Saturday\u2019s announcement, the total number of hostages still held in the Gaza Strip from October 7 is now 116, of which at least 41 are dead. \u2018It is hell on earth\u2019 On the ground in Gaza, locals described scenes of carnage following the strikes that led up to the rescue. Nidal Abdo, was shopping in Nuseirat on Saturday when he described a \u201ccrazy bombardment\u201d hitting. \u201c[It was] something we never witnessed before, maybe 150 rockets fell in less than 10 minutes, while we were running away more fell on the market,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are children torn apart and scattered in the streets, they wiped out Nuseirat, it is hell on earth,\u201d he said. Another local, Abu Abdallah, said the strike hit while people were sleeping, adding: \u201cDogs were eating people\u2019s remains. We pulled out six martyrs, all torn up children and women, we risked our lives to get them to the hospital.\u201d Footage from Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital shows trucks and ambulances transferring injured people and bodies to the hospital. Inside the hospital, people can be seen waiting on the  floor. Graphic video shows many Palestinians, including children, injured with blood on their faces and clothes. Footage from the hospital also shows people screaming and crying, huddled over bodies covered in blankets. Hamas described the operation as a \u201cbrutal crime, devoid of the values of civilization and humanity,\u201d saying the Israeli military \u201ccommitted a horrific massacre against innocent civilians.\u201d Hamas said the rescue would not change Israel\u2019s \u201cstrategic failure in the Gaza Strip,\u201d as the group still holds a large number of other hostages after eight months of fighting. The group\u2019s leader Ismail Haniyeh said, \u201cOur people will not surrender, and the resistance will continue to defend our rights in the face of this criminal enemy.\u201d Abu Obaida, the spokesman for the group\u2019s armed wing, the Al-Qassam Brigades, also claimed some hostages had been killed during the rescue mission, but provided no proof and did not elaborate on the identities of who had purportedly died. In a post on Telegram, he said the rescue raid \u201cposed a great danger\u201d to the remaining hostages and \u201cwill have a devastating impact on their conditions and lives.\u201d Asked about the claim, the Israel Defense Forces said, \u201cHamas is a terrorist organization that uses psychological terrorism in order to achieve its goals, accordingly its statements should be taken with limited credibility.\u201d Hostage rescues are rare: this is only the third such successful operation. IDF Corporal Ori Megidish was rescued in October last year from the northern Gaza Strip. In another operation on February 12 this year, Fernando Marman and Louis Har were rescued from southern Rafah. A symbol of October 7 One of the rescued group, 25-year-old Noa Argamani, became one of the symbols of the October 7 attacks, after video emerged of her shouting and pleading from the seat of a motorbike as a group of Hamas fighters drives away with her in tow. In the video, Argamani\u2019s boyfriend, fellow Israeli citizen Avinatan Or, is also led away by Hamas fighters. Noa\u2019s mother Liora Argamani is a Chinese citizen who has been grappling with late stage brain cancer. In a video released last November, she made a desperate plea to be able to see her daughter one more time. \u201cI don\u2019t know how long I have left. I wish for the chance to see my Noa at home,\u201d her mother said, calling on US President Joe Biden to push for her daughter\u2019s release. A spokesperson for Ichilov Hospital in Tel Aviv confirmed on Saturday that Argamani had been transferred there so that she could be treated alongside her mother. Argamani\u2019s family had previously received signs that she was still alive. She appeared in a series of Hamas propaganda videos released in January this year. Video showed Argamani embracing her father after her release. She also held a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who told her \u201cwe didn\u2019t give up on you for a moment.\u201d Of the others freed: \u2013 Almog Meir Jan, 22, is from the small city of Or Yehuda, outside Tel Aviv. He was due to start a new job at a technology company on October 8. \u2013 Shlomi Ziv, 41, was working as a security guard at the Nova festival when he was kidnapped on October 7. Ziv had been living in the local moshav or agricultural settlement for 17 years with his wife Miren. \u2013 Andrey Kozlov, 27, is a Russian citizen who move to Israel a year ago. He was also working as a security guard at the Nova festival. \u2018We can\u2019t forget\u2019 the others Relatives of the rescued hostages said they felt happy and blessed to be reunited with their loved ones but also called on the Israeli government to bring back the remaining captives. \u201cI couldn\u2019t stop hugging him,\u201d Orit Meir, mother of Almog Meir Jan, told a news conference Saturday. \u201cTomorrow is my birthday so I got my present.\u201d Meir thanked the Israeli military and government for the rescue, but also urged the government to secure the release of the dozens of captives that remained in Gaza. \u201cWe want a deal now. We want them to come back home as soon as possible,\u201d she said. Jennifer Master, the girlfriend of Andrey Kozlov, echoed those sentiments, saying, \u201cThank you for saving our loved ones. And we wish that all the loved ones will come back home safe and sound and there will be a deal soon.\u201d Yaakov Argamani, father of Noa Argamani, added: \u201cWe can\u2019t forget there are 120 hostages. We must do everything, but everything, as soon as possible to bring them home, so that their families can embrace them in happiness.\u201d Rozi Ziv, mother of Shlomi Ziv, said, \u201cMy dream came true. I wish for the other hostages that their dreams will come true, too.\u201d Meanwhile, following news of the rescue, thousands of demonstrators gathered across Israel, calling on the government to secure a deal to free the remaining hostages. In Tel Aviv, demonstrators gathered at a plaza informally known as Hostages Square, many  holding up pictures of the hostages with signs that read, \u201cBring them home now.\u201d Earlier, the crowd cheered the Israeli military for its rescue operation. Many are calling for new elections, calling for Netanyahu\u2019s government to step down.

{"id": "2024_06_02_europe_zelensky-ukraine-shangrila-address-intl-hnk", "text": "China\u2019s support to Russia will extend the war in Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky said Sunday, as he called on countries across the Asia-Pacific to join an upcoming peace summit he accused Russia of trying to thwart. Zelensky made the comments in Singapore during a surprise appearance at a meeting of defense chiefs from across the Asia-Pacific, including China and the US. It comes ahead of\u00a0the international peace\u00a0conference on Ukraine slated to be held June 15-16 in Switzerland. \u201cWith China\u2019s support to Russia the war will last longer. That is bad for the whole world, and the policy of China \u2013 who declares that it supports territorial integrity and sovereignty and declares it officially. For them it is not good,\u201d Zelensky said during a press conference. China claims neutrality in the conflict and has said it is a proponent of peace, even as it has emerged as a key economic lifeline and tightened its already close strategic and diplomatic partnership with Russia since the country\u2019s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The US has also alleged that China\u2019s export of dual-use goods to Russia is powering the warring country\u2019s defense industrial base and warned Beijing of consequences for such support \u2013 a claim Beijing has refuted, saying it has not provided weapons to either side and maintains tight export controls on dual use goods. Zelensky alluded to such support in comments Sunday, saying certain elements that make up parts of Russia\u2019s weaponry \u201ccome from China.\u201d The Ukrainian leader\u00a0also warned that Russia was attempting to pressure countries not to join the upcoming international peace summit \u2013 with China\u2019s help. \u201cRussia is trying to disrupt the peace summit and that is true \u2026 (Russia) is now traveling around many countries in the world threatening them with the blockade of the agricultural goods, of the food products, of chemical products \u2026 it is simply pushing the other countries of the world so that they\u2019re not present on the summit,\u201d Zelensky said after delivering an address at the defense conference. When asked later about China\u2019s statement it would not attend the peace summit, the Ukrainian leader accused Russia of using Chinese diplomats to disrupt it. \u201cRegrettably, it is unfortunate that such big independent powerful country as China is an instrument in the hands of Putin,\u201d Zelensky said, speaking through an interpreter. The Ukrainian leader added that he had not had any meetings with Chinese representatives in Singapore, despite interest on the Ukrainian side for more dialogue. China last week said it would not send a delegation to the peace summit, saying any international peace conference should have \u201crecognition by both Russia and Ukraine, equal participation by all parties, and fair discussion of all peace plans.\u201d Chinese Minister of National Defense Dong Jun in an address earlier Sunday said China had been \u201cpromoting peace talks with a responsible attitude.\u201d  Dong also appeared to respond to US allegations that China is bolstering Russia\u2019s defense industrial base with dual-use exports, saying in his remarks\u00a0that China has not provided weapons to either side in the conflict and had put \u201cstricter control\u201d on dual-use exports. US defense chief Lloyd Austin raised those transactions with Dong during a sideline meeting Friday, where he warned of consequences for any Chinese support of Russia\u2019s military. When asked about Zelensky\u2019s comments dur\ufeffing a regular press briefing in Beijing Monday, a spokesperson for China\u2019s Foreign Ministry defended China\u2019s trade with Russia as \u201cabove board,\u201d adding it was \u201ccertainly not against the peace summit\u201d and there was \u201cno pressure on other countries.\u201d \u201cWe also attach great importance to our relations with Ukraine \u2026 China and Ukraine have maintained communication and cooperation since the Ukrainian crisis escalated,\u201d spokesperson Mao Ning said. \u2018Time is running out\u2019 The Ukrainian leader\u2019s in-person appeal at the Shangri-La Dialogue comes as Ukraine\u2019s troops scramble to repel a major Russian advance into its northeast region of Kharkiv amid shortages of weaponry and manpower more than two years into Russia\u2019s invasion \u2013 raising the urgency for Kyiv to bolster international support for its peace plan. Zelensky\u2019s plan\u00a0calls for the full withdrawal of Russian forces and a restoration of Ukraine\u2019s internationally recognized borders. The Ukrainian leader has previously said he won\u2019t negotiate with Russia until its forces withdraw. \u201cTime is running out\u201d including for Ukrainian children taken by Russia, Zelensky told a packed hall during an address on the closing day of the three-day security meeting. The summit, he said, would address three points of his peace formula, including \u201cnuclear security, food security, and the release of prisoners of war,\u201d as well as \u201cUkrainian children abducted by Russia\u201d and enable countries to come to a consensus on peace in Ukraine that could be \u201cpassed to Russia.\u201d The International Criminal Court in The Hague last year\u00a0issued an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin for an alleged scheme to deport Ukrainian children to Russia. Russia has referred to the peace conference as \u201ctrickery\u201d designed by the United States, with a Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson last week saying the \u201creal \u2018peace formula\u2019\u201d was for Western countries to stop providing Ukraine with weaponry. So far more than 100 countries and international organizations have committed to join the gathering, Zelensky said. The upcoming peace summit and Ukraine\u2019s defense were also key topics for Zelensky as he held sideline meetings since arriving in Singapore on Saturday. Those included talks with US Defense Secretary Austin, Indonesia\u2019s President-Elect Prabowo Subianto, and Timor-Leste\u2019s President Jos\u00e9 Ramos-Horta, as well as a delegation of American lawmakers. In his meeting with Zelensky Sunday morning, Austin reiterated \u201cunwavering US support for Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression\u201d and provided an update on American security assistance to Ukraine, according to a readout from Pentagon press secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder after the meeting. Zelensky said in a post on Twitter that the two sides discussed \u201cthe defense needs of our country, bolstering Ukraine\u2019s air defense system, the F-16 coalition, and drafting of a bilateral security agreement.\u201d He also thanked US President Joe Biden for \u201can important decision\u201d regarding defensive strikes with American weapons, in reference to the White House\u2019s decision, as reported by CNN, to permit Ukraine to use American munitions for limited strikes within Russian territory.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/02/europe/zelensky-ukraine-shangrila-address-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/09/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_04_17_style_copenhagen-stock-exchange-fire-police-investigation-intl", "text": "Police launched an investigation Wednesday into the fire that tore through Copenhagen\u2019s famous stock exchange building, causing the collapse of its spire and damaging centuries-old artwork and architecture. The blaze was still burning on Wednesday afternoon, more than 24 hours after it began, and authorities and citizens in the Danish capital have started reckoning with the loss of one of the city\u2019s most recognizable landmarks. Local firefighters continued to try to put out the fire, which ripped through\u00a0the building \u2013 known locally as B\u00f8rsen \u2013\u00a0from early Tuesday, reaching all its floors and causing the collapse of a dragon-tail spire that had long been a symbol of the city. The walls of the building are still standing, but the interior has been significantly damaged and the roof is partially collapsed. Firefighters used cranes to hose water down into the building. Copenhagen\u00a0police meanwhile launched an investigation on Wednesday, which they said will be a \u201ccomplicated process.\u201d Police officer Brian Belling said authorities have already \u201cconducted interviews, secured surveillance and carried out a large number of investigative steps.\u201d \u201cBut of course, there is still a lot to do, especially as we have not yet had the opportunity to examine\u00a0B\u00f8rsen itself,\u201d Belling added. The 17th century building exemplified the style of the Dutch Renaissance, and housed a number of artworks, some of which were saved on Tuesday. Residents were stunned by the outbreak, which brought back memories of the fire that tore through the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris exactly five years and a day earlier. \u201cMy first thought was (that) I hope that they rebuild it \u2013 it\u2019s never going to be the same but it\u2019s iconic to\u00a0Copenhagen\u00a0and Denmark,\u201d teacher Eva Simoni Lomholdt, 58, told Reuters. Brian Mikkelsen, the CEO of the Danish Chamber of Commerce which owns the building, told the news agency that a firefighter gave him the top of the spire on Wednesday morning after it was recovered following its fall. \u201cIt gives me hope because we have decided to rebuild the stock exchange because it\u2019s part of European history as a trading continent,\u201d he said. The old stock exchange \u2013 located only a few minutes walk from Christiansborg\u00a0Palace \u2013 dates back to 1625. It was built in the Dutch Renaissance style at the request of King Christian IV and had recently been undergoing renovations with its facade covered in scaffolding and protective coverings. It has been at the heart of Danish business since then; while it no longer houses the Danish stock exchange, it serves as the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce. Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said Tuesday a \u201cpiece of Danish history\u201d was on fire, calling the building \u201cirreplaceable.\u201d Denmark\u2019s culture minister Jakob Engel-Schmidt added that 400 years of cultural heritage had been damaged. \u201cHow touching it is to see how the employees at B\u00f8rsen, good people from the emergency services and passers-by work together to rescue art treasures and iconic images from the burning building,\u201d he said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/17/style/copenhagen-stock-exchange-fire-police-investigation-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/09/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_03_asia_shangrila-dialogue-china-trump-intl-hnk", "text": "Any tourist wandering through the glitzy lobby of Singapore\u2019s Shangri-La Hotel this weekend would have stumbled on a rather bizarre scene. Military officers from around the world thronged the halls of the luxury hotel, their shoulders dripping with gold braids and epaulets, complicated colored bars lined up on the chests of their dress uniforms like some martial game of Tetris. Every few minutes a defense minister strode purposely through the mix, surrounded by a phalanx of aides and escorts. This gathering is an annual spectacle that to the uninitiated might seem surreal. But the topics being discussed here are deadly serious. The annual Shangri-La Dialogue is one of the few places in the world where you can watch warriors who spend their careers preparing for armed conflict, engaged in polite, carefully-moderated debate. The stakes this year could hardly be higher. War rages in both the Middle East and Europe. Meanwhile China\u2019s increasingly assertive moves has much of the Asia-Pacific on edge. The Singapore summit brought key players together. Where else would you have the President of the Philippines, a nation whichdo has seen its vessels increasingly targeted by Chinese coast guard ships in the disputed South China Sea, deliver a keynote address on the same stage that, two days later, Beijing\u2019s new Defense Minister makes his debut appearance? There was even a surprise appearance from Ukraine\u2019s embattled president Volodymyr Zelensky \u2013 and a first face-to-face meeting between US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and his Chinese counterpart Adm Dong Jun. Given its location in the city-state of Singapore, events in Asia \u2013 and in particular China\u2019s behavior in the region \u2013 stalked the conference. In his keynote speech, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. issued a stark warning about the ongoing confrontations between Philippine and China Coast Guard vessels in a contested part of the South China Sea. \u201cIf a Filipino citizen is killed by a willful act,\u201d he said, \u201cthat is I think, very, very close to what we define as an act of war.\u201d Two days later, China\u2019s Adm Dong fired back from the same stage, accusing the Philippines of \u201cblackmail\u201d in the maritime dispute. \u201cThere is a limit to our restraint,\u201d said Admiral Dong Jun. \u201cI saw that as a threat,\u201d said Dewi Fortuna Anwar, a research professor at Indonesia\u2019s National Research and Innovation Center who has been attending the Shangri-La Dialogue since its founding twenty-one years ago. \u201cIn decades past, the Chinese only came in a small number and they were extremely quiet,\u201d she said.\u00a0 \u201cNow they\u2019re very self confident\u2026they intervene in all the sessions.\u201d The open nature of the Shangri-La Dialogue provides delegates with a unique opportunity to ask blunt questions of speakers. After his speech on Sunday, China\u2019s Dong received many questions from audience members on Beijing\u2019s increased threats towards self-governing Taiwan as well as its disputed claims in the South China Sea, and he replied in unapologetic terms. The \u201cseparatists\u201d in Taiwan\u2019s newly-elected government would\u00a0be \u201cnailed to the pillar of shame in history,\u201d he said. But equally, Chinese military officers also used Q&A sessions at other key moments to make their views known. Senior Colonel Yanzhong Cao of China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army asked US Secretary of Defense asked US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin whether the US was trying to build a NATO-like alliance in the Asia-Pacific region, adding the claim \u201cthe eastward expansion of NATO has led to the Ukraine crisis.\u201d \u201cI respectfully disagree,\u201d Austin replied, the audience in the ballroom then erupting into a rare burst of applause. \u201cThe Ukraine crisis obviously was caused because Mr. Putin made a decision to unlawfully invade his neighbor,\u201d Austin continued. \u201cThis was brought on because of a decision by Mr. Putin.\u201d Later that day, Ukrainian leader Zelensky got a borderline rock star welcome when he made a surprise appearance at the conference, dressed in his trademark fatigues and black t-shirt. \u201cWe stand with you,\u201d Ng Eng Hen, Singapore\u2019s minister of defense, later said to Zelensky. But the large contingent of Chinese army officers present at other sessions was notably absent during Zelensky\u2019s speech and the Ukrainian leader said he failed to secure a one-on-one meeting with Chinese officials during his Singapore visit. He also accused Beijing of aiding Ukraine\u2019s mortal enemy. \u201cWith China\u2019s support to Russia, the war will last longer.\u00a0\u00a0That is bad for the whole world, and the policy of China \u2013 who declares that it supports territorial integrity and sovereignty and declares it officially. For them it is not good,\u201d Zelensky told journalists. It was not clear whether Zelensky succeeded in securing new support for Kyiv from non-aligned south-east Asian countries like Malaysia and Indonesia. Instead, Indonesian president-elect and retired general Prabowo Subianto \u2013 the new leader of the world\u2019s most populous Muslim majority nation \u2013 spent much of his speech calling for an end to the on-going carnage in Gaza and an investigation into recent Israeli attacks that killed dozens of displaced civilians in Rafah. Another political elephant in the room was what direction might the United States be heading in. The Singapore gathering began just hours after a 12-person jury in a court-room in New York City\u00a0convicted former US President Donald Trump on of all 34 counts of falsifying business records in his hush money criminal trial. Asia is watching very closely for whether Trump will return to office in November and what impact that might have on the world\u2019s most populous continent and a region already fraught with very real geopolitical fault lines. Republican Senator Dan Sullivan requested not to discuss Trump during a meeting with journalists, instead directing reporters to a press release. \u201cThis is a very sad day for American and the rule of law,\u201d Sullivan\u2019s statement said, calling the verdict a \u201cgross abuse of our justice system.\u201d But speaking to journalists, the Senator from Alaska also celebrated what he called America\u2019s \u201ccommitment to liberty and democracy,\u201d saying this marked a competitive advantage over \u201cauthoritarian aggression led by China, Russia, Iran and North Korea.\u201d Sullivan was part of a bi-partisan delegation seeking to demonstrate Congressional commitment to US allies in Asia. \u201cThe dictators we are allied against\u2026are ally poor,\u201d Sullivan said. But there are clearly concerns about US reliability. An academic from Japan \u2013 Washington\u2019s closest ally in Asia \u2013 asked defense chiefs from Singapore and Malaysia about Trump\u2019s possible re-election.\u00a0 He called it a \u201cnightmare\u201d scenario. That triggered nervous laughter from the audience and on stage. Singapore\u2019s Dr. Ng Eng Hen gamely responded, \u201cwe will work with any administration in any country if we can find common ground.\u201d I vividly remember collective nervousness at the 2017 Shangri-La Dialogue, held just months after Trump\u2019s inauguration. Trump\u2019s then secretary of defense James Mattis clearly sought to reassure American defense partners worried about the new mercurial president. \u201cBear with us,\u201d Mattis told the audience, after being asked whether the \u201cAmerica First\u201d commander-in-chief would contribute to the destruction of the post-World War II order. \u201cOnce we\u2019ve exhausted all possible alternatives, the Americans will do the right thing.\u00a0 We will still be there.\u201d Seven years later, uncertainty over the political future of the US is just one of many challenges facing policy makers. One by one, the leaders of armies and navies shared their fears about climate change, nuclear proliferation, wars in Europe and the Middle East and concerns that a miscalculation between the US and Chinese militaries could spiral out of control \u201cThe world cannot withstand a third geopolitical shock,\u201d Singaporean defense chief Dr. Ng warned, after invoking the Gaza and Ukraine conflicts. In this tense geopolitical environment, it\u2019s far better for commanders to put on their dress uniforms and rub shoulders in the halls of a five-star hotel, than aim at each other over gun barrels on the battlefield.

{"id": "2024_06_06_americas_cuba-russian-ships-submarine-visit-intl-latam", "text": "A group of Russian naval ships, including a nuclear-powered submarine, will visit Cuba next week as part of \u201chistorically friendly relations,\u201d Cuba\u2019s government said Thursday. The Russian \u201cfrigate Gorshkov, the nuclear-powered submarine Kazan, the fleet oil tanker Pashin, and the rescue tug Nikolai Chiker\u201d will visit the port of Havana between June 12 and 17, according to the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces in a statement published by the Foreign Ministry. Cuba says none of the ships carry nuclear weapons and insists their stopover does not represent a threat to the region. \u201cVisits by naval units from other countries are a historical practice of the revolutionary government with nations that maintain relations of friendship and collaboration,\u201d the statement added. Moscow has not confirmed the information provided by Cuba. CNN has reached out to the Russian government for comment. It\u2019s not the first time Russian Navy ships have been sent to Cuba, a key ally to the former Soviet Union during the Cold War that briefly hosted nuclear missiles at Moscow\u2019s behest during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. Last July, the Russian Navy\u2019s training class ship Perekop sailed into Havana for a four-day visit. The latest visit appears to be the largest of its kind in years. Cuba is increasingly reliant on Russian oil and aid as the communist-run country weathers its worst economic crisis in decades. Cuba\u2019s announcement comes days after US President Joe Biden gave Ukraine permission to carry out limited strikes inside Russian territory with American munitions. In response, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Western countries \u201csupplying weapons to a conflict zone is always a bad thing.\u201d \u201cIn the end, if we see that these countries become involved in a war against us, what they are doing makes them directly involved in a war against the Russian Federation, we reserve the right to act the same way,\u201d Putin said on Wednesday. Putin added that as a response, \u201cwe will improve our air defense systems to destroy the missiles.\u201d He also asked why Russia would \u201cnot have the right to supply our weapons of the same class to those regions of the world where there will be strikes on the sensitive facilities of those countries that are doing this against Russia?\u201d \u2018No direct threat\u2019 Russia\u2019s military is expected to increase its naval and air activity near the United States this summer as part of routine maneuvers in the lead up to a global naval exercise in the fall, according to the US State Department and the Pentagon. \u201cRussia is likely to send combat naval vessels to the Caribbean, with potential port calls in Cuba and possibly Venezuela,\u201d Pentagon spokesperson Maj. Charlie Dietz said on Thursday. \u201cAircraft deployments or flights in the region are also anticipated. These deployments are part of Russia\u2019s routine naval operations and pose no direct threat to the United States.\u201d Alongside Russian ships this summer will also be one of the Russian Navy\u2019s Severodvinsk II-class submarines, Dietz said. The port call for that submarine was approved \u201cat least in part due to Havana\u2019s displeasure\u201d over the visit of a US nuclear submarine to the US\u2019 Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba last year, he said. Cuba has hosted Russian ships every year between 2013 and 2020, Dietz said, adding that the exercises \u201cimpose a significant cost on the Russian Navy, which faces challenges in maintaining readiness and conducting deployments with an aging fleet.\u201d \u201cGiven Russia\u2019s long history of Cuban port calls, these are considered routine naval visits, especially in the context of increased US support to Ukraine and NATO exercises,\u201d Dietz said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/americas/cuba-russian-ships-submarine-visit-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/09/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_middleeast_turkey-israel-hamas-war-politics-mime-intl", "text": "Since the war in Gaza began, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been one of Israel\u2019s harshest and most vocal critics \u2013 routinely branding it a terror state, comparing its prime minister to Hitler and heaping praise on Hamas. The Palestinian militant group is considered a terror group by most members of NATO, but not Turkey. Some Western critics might accuse Erdogan of going too far in supporting Hamas, but recent events suggest he has not yet appeased his domestic political base. After Erdogan\u2019s ruling party was handed a humbling defeat in local elections in March, he promised to think hard about what went wrong. Beyond the sputtering Turkish economy \u2013 many pundits blamed the electoral setback on his stance on Israel and its war in Gaza. Political challengers, like the smaller, ultra-conservative New Welfare party, managed to siphon off votes from the president\u2019s ruling AK Party by taking a tougher stance against Israel and demanding concrete actions beyond the fiery rhetoric Erdogan is known for. \u201cWe do not see (the government) doing anything other than speaking and condemning. There are no sanctions, no concrete steps taken, trade with Israel still continues,\u201d said New Welfare\u2019s leader Fatih Erbakan in March. The president may have believed that strong rhetoric against Israel was enough, Seda Demiralp, a political scientist at Isik University, told CNN after the election. \u201cErdogan really underestimated New Welfare and how much New Welfare could mobilize conservative voters.\u201d Correcting course After the election, Erdogan wasted little time correcting course, swiftly moving to match words with actions. In a matter of days, some trade with Israel was cut off. Three weeks later, all trade was cut off. Some $7 billion worth of annual trade \u2013 mostly Turkish exports \u2013 is now on pause until the war is over. That wasn\u2019t all. Last month, Turkey announced its intention to join the genocide case against Israel at the International Court of Justice. Already warm ties with Hamas were made even warmer when Erdogan hosted the group\u2019s political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Istanbul on April 20, and posed with him for pictures. Erdogan has compared Hamas to the \u201cKuvayi Milliye,\u201d the nationalist militias that fought against foreign occupation during the Turkish War of Independence after World War I. \u201cBelieve me, if it were 100 years ago, they would also call Kuvayi Milliye a terrorist organization, a rebel, a joke, a traitor,\u201d Erdogan said in a speech to party lawmakers in May, according to state broadcaster TRT. \u201cThis nation has always stood by the oppressed.\u201d The gap between how Turkey and its NATO allies view Hamas was on full, awkward display when Erdogan hosted Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis last month in Ankara. \u201cI don\u2019t see Hamas as a terrorist organization,\u201d Erdogan declared. \u201cOn the contrary, Hamas is an organization of resistance, whose territories have been occupied since 1947 and which has been defending its territories after the occupation\u2026 If you call them a \u2018terrorist organization,\u2019 it will upset us.\u201d \u201cWe can agree to disagree on this topic,\u201d Mitsotakis replied. Erdogan went on to claim that \u201cover 1,000 Hamas members are now under treatment in our hospitals in Turkey.\u201d A Turkish official with knowledge of the situation has since told CNN the president misspoke.\u00a0\u201cHe meant 1,000 Gazans are under treatment, who aren\u2019t Hamas members,\u201d the official said. Since the war began, the Turkish Ministry of Health has made several medical airlifts of injured Gazans and their family members to hospitals in Turkey. For Erdogan, \u2018Hamas is Palestine\u2019 Experts say the comment made by Erdogan in the presence of the Greek leader may have in fact been intended for an audience closer to home. \u201cWestern leaders right now are very aware that Erdogan is basically talking for his domestic audience and for the Muslim neighborhood,\u201d said Evren Balta, an international relations professor at Ozyegin University in Istanbul. Domestically, she said, the president has managed to link Hamas and the Palestinians to the point that \u201cwhen you are criticizing Hamas publicly, it is as if you\u2019re criticizing the Palestinian cause.\u201d That, coupled with the strong affinity the Turkish public has with Palestinians, has led politicians of all stripes to tread carefully on the issue, particularly some secular and nationalist opposition parties. \u201cFor Erdogan, Hamas is Palestine. For the opposition, Hamas is not Palestine, but they are having difficulties framing the political discourse,\u201d Balta said. At a political rally ahead of the March local elections, Ozgur Ozel, leader of the secular CHP party established by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of modern Turkey, highlighted his party\u2019s longstanding support for the Palestinian cause and sought to counter claims that he regards Hamas as a terrorist organization. \u201cI have not called Hamas a terrorist organization, but I have condemned its terrorist attacks,\u201d he said. \u201cI also condemned Israel\u2019s state terrorism.\u201d He then went on to taunt the president. \u201cNow come on, Erdogan. If you are on Palestine\u2019s side, stop the trade that your relatives, children, supporters and friends do with Israel every day.\u201d After the elections, Istanbul\u2019s CHP mayor Ekrem Imamoglu \u2013 widely touted as a future presidential contender \u2013 took fierce criticism from political rivals and in the Turkish press for branding Hamas as a terrorist organization in an interview with CNN in April. This was despite his harsh condemnation of Israel and its \u201cbrutal oppression\u201d of Palestinians. \u2018No influence\u2019 on NATO Turkey\u2019s NATO allies in the West have been quick to condemn Hamas, but they\u2019ve been largely silent on Ankara\u2019s cozy relations with the group. \u201cI think there is a degree of discomfort,\u201d about the relationship, said Fabrice Pothier, a former NATO policy chief, who now leads the Rasmussen Global political consultancy. \u201cIt is not benign, that there is one major ally that is far away from the others, but I think NATO manages \u2013 up to a point \u2013 to compartmentalize between the bilateral positions or issues of allies, and the NATO collective positions and issues.\u201d A case in point, in October, NATO leader Jens Stoltenberg told the German Press Agency that Turkey-Hamas relations are not a problem because \u201cin some ways it has no influence on what we do or don\u2019t do because we don\u2019t play a role in this particular conflict.\u201d Hamas members can freely come and go from Turkey and have a regular presence in the country. In fact, in December, Erdogan\u2019s chief foreign policy and security adviser, Akif Cagatay Kilic told CNN that Hamas\u2019 political leader Haniyeh \u201cmight have been\u201d in Turkey on October 7, the day the militant group led an attack on Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking 250 hostages. But he claimed that historically, Turkey\u2019s relationship with Hamas hasn\u2019t merely been tolerated by Israel, but has even been encouraged. He said former Turkish leaders \u201chave been asked \u2013 even by (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu \u2013 to engage with Hamas.\u201d Turkey\u2019s aim is to bring peace to the region, he said. \u201cWe\u2019re doing whatever it takes to achieve that.\u201d \u2018Inflation of mediators\u2019 Although it isn\u2019t officially a mediator in the Gaza conflict, there are indications that Ankara is involved on some level. In April, Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said Hamas was willing to dissolve its military wing if a Palestinian state was created within the 1967 borders. This was later confirmed by an Istanbul-based Hamas member, marking the first time the group has offered to lay down its arms. Fidan also helped relay messages between Washington and Tehran ahead of Iran\u2019s barrage of missiles fired at Israel in April, and there is some indication that Ankara may be playing a similar conduit role between Washington and Hamas. \u201cWe have been in touch with both the US and Hamas. We have been advising and encouraging both sides for an immediate and permanent ceasefire,\u201d a Turkish official told CNN \u2013 pointing to calls that Fidan held with both Haniyeh and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on the same day in mid-May. With Qatar mulling a possible exit from its mediation role, Balta says Turkey could potentially help fill the gap, despite its Hamas ties increasing distrust with Israel and the West. But, she says, the West would much prefer to deal with Turkey than with, say, Iran, which could become a future refuge for Hamas leaders if the group is forced to leave Qatar, where its political office is based. \u201cWestern governments know how to deal with Turkey\u2026 so when it comes to Middle Eastern conflicts, who else is going to be a reliable partner? Really, there are not many other reliable partners,\u201d she said. For now, Turkey isn\u2019t interested in playing a formal role in trying to bring an end to the war in Gaza. \u201cWe do not want to create an inflation of mediators,\u201d a Turkish Foreign Ministry source told CNN in April. Despite some discomfort with Turkey\u2019s close ties to Hamas, Western states, Pothier believes, figure it\u2019s better just to tolerate it. \u201cI think the West is finding it useful to have countries who can be between us and Hamas,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/middleeast/turkey-israel-hamas-war-politics-mime-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/09/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "world_africa_bananas-artificial-hair-cheverux-organique-spc", "text": "During a visit to a local farm while working with development agency USAID, Ugandan entrepreneur Juliet Tumusiime realized that a huge amount of banana stems are left over from banana cultivation and simply discarded. Looking for a way to use the waste, she struck upon an innovative business idea. Almost a decade later, now aged 42, Tumusiime is the chief executive and co-founder of Cheveux Organique, which manufactures hair made from banana fibers as an alternative to synthetic extensions. Fashion trends among the younger population and growing purchasing power have boosted the market for hair extensions and wigs in the Africa and the Middle East, which could be worth $710 million by 2028, according to Research and Markets. Extensions are typically made from human hair, or synthetic materials such as nylon, polyester, acrylic and PVC. Synthetics are popular in Uganda because they\u2019re much cheaper, but they\u2019re not biodegradable or easy to recycle. Some people complain that synthetic hair can irritate their scalp and a study of synthetic hair in Nigeria found the presence of potentially harmful heavy metals and chemicals. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to friends, colleagues, both men and women and asked them how they dispose of their hair when they take it out,\u201d Tumusiime says. \u201cA lot of the time it is just thrown in the trash. The level of awareness is really low - most people don\u2019t realize that they are wearing plastic on their head which can irritate the skin and cause pollution. \u201cOur mission is to transform the beauty industry by providing alternatives that benefit their health and the environment. We want to empower women to make informed decisions about what hair they use and what\u2019s best for them.\u201d Tumusiime says that, unlike synthetic hair, her product is biodegradable, durable and can be easily styled, treated and colored. It can also be rewashed with warm water and conditioned with detangling cream. When dry, the hypoallergenic hair can be oiled and can withstand dryers and heat up to 400 degrees, lasting weeks longer than synthetic alternatives, according to Tumusiime. Since it\u2019s made from discarded banana stems, she adds, it\u2019s also a way to help curb that waste. Uganda is Africa\u2019s largest producer and consumer of bananas, producing about 10 million metric tons of bananas per day. Ugandans consume almost one kilogram of the fruit per person, per day, with more than 75% of the population relying on bananas as a staple food, according to the World Economic Forum. Cheveux Organique works closely with local banana farmers, buying stems that would otherwise be discarded. The stems are split and the fibers extracted by machine. The extracted fibers are then dried and treated, before being combed out, resulting in the hair-like texture. The \u201chair\u201d is dyed into three shades: Cheveux Black, Cheveux Brown and Cheveux Blonde. Tumusiime says it has a natural sheen, is soft to the touch and can be used for braiding and styling. It\u2019s also suitable for warm and humid climates, she notes. The company isn\u2019t unique in creating plant-based hair. In the US, St.Louis-based Rebundle also sells hair extensions made from banana fibers, while Nourie Hair offers a hair alternative for braiding made from Ginseng root extract and rosemary. However, turning banana waste into a premium product does not come without challenges for Cheveux Organique. \u201cThe labor-intensive process, from picking the stems, transporting them to the facility, extracting the stems, treating them and the power needed to use this \u2013 it causes the product to become pricey,\u201d Tumusiime says. Cheveux Organique sells its plant-based hair in Uganda, and as fair afield as the US, France and the UK. It retails for $50 for 150 grams (5.3 ounces), which Tumusiime says is cheaper than a typical $185 for a similar amount of human hair. But synthetic hair can be bought for as little as $1 for a bundle. \u201cThis is something that we are hugely concerned about, and we are trying to find ways to mechanize the business and produce volumes of hair whilst continuing to break even,\u201d Tumusiime says. \u201cThe people paying these prices are getting a premium product at the end of it \u2013 and it\u2019s about the long-term benefits that this product brings.\u201d Tumusiime says her startup, which currently employs 25 permanent staff members and 100 part-time workers for waste gathering, is in the process of creating regional hubs, which will function as extraction centers, as well as an education point for young people. The hubs will train future generations on the positive impacts of waste management, as well as giving young people skillsets \u2013 such as extraction and machine operation \u2013 that will equip them for future careers. \u201cWe want to make sure that this brand is a household name,\u201d Tumusiime says. \u201cWe want to become leaders in this industry despite challenges. But I\u2019m passionate about what I\u2019m doing. I\u2019m not about to give up. I do everything possible to make sure that I achieve my objectives and achieve the vision for which I started this organization.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/world/africa/bananas-artificial-hair-cheverux-organique-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/09/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_07_weather_heat-dome-wave-record-temperatures-southwest", "text": "A dangerous heat wave is expanding into new areas of the West and lingering in others Friday, bringing with it record-breaking temperatures and a serious risk of heat-related illness. The searing heat has already taken its toll. Since last weekend, multiple people in different parts of the US have died or have been hospitalized due to heat-related illnesses. The worst of the heat peaked Thursday for much of California and the Southwest, but unseasonably hot conditions will stick around in these areas and expand into the Pacific Northwest at least through the weekend. Heat alerts are in effect for more than 16 million people in California, Nevada, Arizona, Utah and New Mexico. Most will last through Friday but alerts in Las Vegas and Death Valley, California, last into Saturday. Several notable temperature records were broken Thursday in California, Arizona and Nevada. In California, a high of 122 degrees in Death Valley broke a daily record set in 1996. And in Fresno, a 121-year-old record was tied Thursday when the city maxed out at 107 degrees. Phoenix recorded its first high of 110 degrees or more this year when thermometers topped out at a daily record-setting 113 degrees Thursday. Las Vegas soared to 111 degrees Thursday, the earliest in the year the city has reached the mark, breaking the daily record of 110 degrees set in 2010. Several people across US have died from heat-related illnesses Six people believed to be migrants have died because of the heat in the past week along the US-Mexico border from southwestern Texas to New Mexico, according to US Border Patrol and the Sunland Park, New Mexico, fire department. Four people died \u201cfrom heat stroke and dehydration\u201d while triple-digit temperatures baked the area last weekend, the US Border Patrol, El Paso Sector said. Two more people were discovered in a desert area about six miles from the border in Sunland Park and were pronounced dead Wednesday, Sunland Park fire chief Daniel Medrano told CNN. Sunland Park is around 10 miles northwest of El Paso, Texas, along the New Mexico-Mexico border. Excessive heat is the leading weather related killer in the US, according to the National Weather Service. \u201cThis is especially true in the urban centers, where population density, the urban heat island, and building construction exacerbate the effects of excessive heat,\u201d the weather service says. \u201cA combination of high heat and humidity can lead to heat related illness, including heat cramps, heat exhaustion, and heat stroke.\u201d In the East, a 59-year-old man died of heat-related complications in Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland, officials said Wednesday. Additional details about the man\u2019s death, which was the state\u2019s first heat-related death of the year, were not released. Heat proved challenging for firefighters battling a blaze in California\u2019s Napa County Wednesday. Four firefighters were sent to area hospitals for injuries related to difficult terrain and \u201chot summer conditions,\u201d according to CAL Fire\u2019s Sonoma-Lake-Napa Unit. All four are expected to make full recoveries. Phoenix emergency responders on Thursday say they hospitalized 11 people due to heat exhaustion while they were attending a Donald Trump rally at the Dream City Church. With the risk of heat-related illnesses increasing for millions across the country, officials in several states are trying to keep residents safe during the smoldering heat. In California, cooling centers have been set up for those affected by triple-digit heat. As Texas contends with both severe storms and excessive heat, a state disaster declaration remains active. Hazardous heat expected into weekend Heat will continue through the weekend before easing off a bit early next week. However, many typically hot areas in the West will still have to contend with temperatures up to 10 degrees above normal and warm nighttime lows will make it difficult for those vulnerable to extreme conditions to be able to cool off. The Las Vegas metro area is at \u201cextreme\u201d risk from the heat through Saturday, according to a scale from the National Weather Service that gauges heat\u2019s potential impact on people\u2019s health. The highest level on the heat risk scale means residents without enough cooling and hydration will be impacted, and \u201cimpacts are likely in most health systems, heat-sensitive industries and infrastructure.\u201d Several more large metro areas in Arizona, California, New Mexico and Texas will face a \u201cmajor\u201d Level 3 of 4 heat risk. Summerlike heat will expand north and east Friday and reach the Northwest and parts of the Rockies. Records could be broken in parts of Oregon, Washington and Idaho from Friday through the weekend. While it won\u2019t be record-breaking, Seattle could come close to 80 degrees on Saturday, 10 degrees warmer than what\u2019s typical for early June.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/weather/heat-dome-wave-record-temperatures-southwest/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/09/2024", "section": "world"}}

There\u2019s the Art Deco curved crown of the Chrysler Building, the sweeping isosceles triangles that twist around One World Trade Center, the stepped limestone and granite rectangles of the Empire State Building and the triangular prism of the Flatiron Building. And now, a multi-billion-dollar tower featuring floor-to-ceiling glass will add another dimension to the cityscape, according to new details unveiled by New York City Mayor Eric Adams this week. Stretching up 62 stories, a planned office tower at 350 Park Avenue will provide space for more than 6,000 jobs, plus 1.8 million square feet of commercial office space, according to a press release. It will be funded by Vornado Realty Trust, Kenneth Griffin, founder and CEO of global investment firm Citadel, and building and management company Rudin. White columns will frame a new public concourse at the base of the new building on Park Avenue, complete with green space, seating and art displays, images show. Above, landscaped terraces will top each section of the glass-clad tower which will house the offices for Citadel and market making firm Citadel Securities. Adams hailed the project in the release, saying it will help \u201csupercharge our economy and expand New York City\u2019s iconic skyline,\u201d building on \u201ccontinued efforts to energize Midtown Manhattan as the world\u2019s most important business address and an economic engine for working-class New Yorkers.\u201d Architects Foster + Partners have designed the building, which will replace the existing 30-story tower currently at the site in Midtown Manhattan just a few blocks away from landmarks like the Rockefeller Center, St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral and Grand Central Station. As New York continues to deal with the economic aftershocks wrought by the Covid-19 pandemic, Adams and his administration said in their respective statements that they hoped this project would continue the city\u2019s recovery. \u201cThis investment opens a new chapter for Midtown \u2014 and closes the book on those who predicted its demise,\u201d said deputy mayor for operations Meera Joshi. \u201cMidtown\u2019s revitalization is being led by its public realm \u2014 including investments in Fifth Avenue, with the crown jewels of Central Park and Bryant Park at either end. Together, with our business improvement district and parks partners, we are reintroducing Fifth Avenue to the world and creating a vibrant live, work, play community for a new era,\u201d Joshi added. Building this new office space comes at a fraught time for the commercial real estate market as businesses struggle to entice workers back to the office after years of working from home. This has left vast tranches of office space vacant or underused, causing the value of such buildings to plummet at the same time as historically high interest rates have made it harder for real estate developers \u2014\u00a0who often take out huge loans to finance projects \u2014\u00a0to make good on their repayments.

The flames consumed some 4,000 dunams (1,000 acres or 400 hectares) of the northern region, chief of the Tiberias fire station Boris Eisenberg said. Israel Fire and Rescue Services said multiple firefighting teams, including an air firefighting squadron, had been deployed, working through the night. On Tuesday, Israel Fire and Rescue Services in the north of the country dealt with two blazes. Twelve teams were deployed to Keren Naftali, where a fire had spread in several directions, while 10 teams had been deployed to the Biria Forest in the Upper Galilee area, where a falling Israeli interceptor missile caused a second blaze.  \u201cWe saw the interception and responded with increased forces and high intensity, we are operating on the spot and trying to contain the fire,\u201d spokesperson Uri Cohen told CNN. \u201cWe are dealing with extreme weather conditions, changing winds, high dryness with low humidity, high temperature. All these conditions together accelerate the development of the fire,\u201d Cohen said. By late Tuesday, all major fires in the north had been brought under control, according to the rescue authority. Authorities had begun evacuating residents as fires broke out at noon local time on Monday in the mountainous Galilee region, Israeli police said. Israeli police said they helped to evacuate homes in Kiryat Shmona, a northern city near the Lebanese border. The blazes came after authorities warned the public Monday that a heatwave was expected and cautioned against lighting fires in forests. Lebanon-based Islamist group Hezbollah said Monday that it launched a \u201cswarm of drones\u201d at an Israeli military command center in the Galilee, causing fires in the building. The group said they were a response to Israeli strikes on Hezbollah forces as well as homes in southern Lebanon, adding that three Hezbollah fighters were killed on Monday.

{"id": "2024_06_03_europe_ukraine-western-weapons-hit-russian-territory-intl-latam", "text": "Ukrainian forces\u00a0claimed Monday that they had successfully hit a Russian S-300 missile system using Western-supplied weapons inside Russian territory. \u201cIt burns beautifully. It\u2019s a Russian S-300. On Russian territory. The first days after permission to use Western weapons on enemy territory,\u201d Ukrainian government minister Iryna Vereshchuk posted on Facebook alongside a picture purporting to show the strike. This comes just days after US President Joe Biden gave Ukraine permission to carry out limited strikes using US weapons in Russian territory around Kharkiv, after several European nations had removed restrictions on how the weapons can be used. It is unclear if the weapons used in the strike described by Vereshchuk were US-supplied. Ukraine had for months pleaded with Washington to allow it to strike targets on Russian soil with US weapons, as Moscow launched a brutal aerial and ground assault on Kharkiv, safe in the knowledge that its troops could retreat back to Russian soil to regroup and its weapons depots could not be targeted with Western arms. The permission granted by the US was both groundbreaking and bold, but tentative and highly conditional. Ukraine can only hit targets around Kharkiv, and the US is standing firm in not allowing Ukraine to use the most formidable munition it has been given to fire into Russia: the long-range missiles known as ATACMS that can hit targets 300 kilometers (nearly 200 miles) away. Instead, Ukraine can only use shorter-range missiles known as GMLRS, which have a range of around 70 kilometers (around 40 miles). For that reason, military analysts praised the decision, but tempered expectations. Franz-Stefan Gady, an associate fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, told CNN the GMLRS cross-border strikes will allow Ukraine \u201cto hit some Russian staging areas, command and control centers, as well as supply depots. It will not stop but complicate Russian military operations against Kharkhiv.\u201d Mathieu Boulegue, a consulting fellow at UK-based Chatham House, told CNN the policy change was \u201cnot a game changer, per se. It\u2019s an add-on, a steroid, an extra booster for Ukraine to defend itself.\u201d While the removal of this taboo appears to mark a new chapter in the war, Russia has already experienced Ukrainian strikes with Western weapons on territory to which it lays claim. Ukraine has frequently targeted occupied Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, using \u201cStorm Shadow\u201d missiles provided by the\u00a0United Kingdom. Ukraine also launched strikes on Kharkiv and Kherson in late 2022, as it sought to liberate the regions occupied by Russia in the early weeks of the war. Then as now, Russian President Vladimir Putin and other Russian officials rattled the nuclear saber in an attempt to deter Western support. Before Biden gave Kyiv the green light, Putin said the decision could lead to \u201cserious consequences,\u201d particularly for \u201csmall and densely populated countries.\u201d The US joined several other European countries, including the UK, France and Germany, in removing this particular restriction on how Ukraine can use the weapons it has been given. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has praised Biden\u2019s decision to allow some strikes in Russian territory as a \u201cstep forward\u201d that will help his forces defend the embattled Kharkiv region.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/europe/ukraine-western-weapons-hit-russian-territory-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/09/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_americas_american-john-poulos-sentenced-valentina-trespalacios-intl-latam", "text": "American John Poulos was sentenced on Tuesday to more than 42 years in prison by a Colombian court, after he was found guilty of aggravated femicide in the killing o\ufefff a young Colombian DJ named Valentina Trespalacios, as well as crimes of concealment, alteration or destruction of evidence. The killing occurred in Bogot\u00e1 in January 2023, and has since captured public attention in Colombia. Before her death, Trespalacios was beginning to gain success at music festivals and had been in a romantic relationship with Poulos since 2021, according to accounts from her family and lawyers who took her case. The Office of the Attorney General of Colombia said in a statement after the ruling that its prosecutors had proven that Poulos struck and suffocated his partner and tried to hide the body. \u201cThe security camera records show that the aggressor wrapped the victim\u2019s body, hid it in a suitcase and abandoned it in a garbage container in the town of Fontib\u00f3n, in the west of Bogot\u00e1. It was found there hours later by the authorities,\u201d the AG office said. During Tuesday\u2019s court proceedings, the judge considered that the evidence presented by the prosecutors was sufficient to determine Poulos\u2019 guilt, imposing a prison sentence of 42 years and eight months \u2013 about five years less than what prosecutors had requested. Additionally, the judge prohibited Poulos from approaching or attempting to communicate with Trespalacios\u2019 family for 20 years, and ordered that he be expelled from Colombia once he completes his sentence. Poulos\u2019 defense team has said it will appeal the judgement. It had argued that Poulos was innocent of femicide and that he should instead be tried for homicide, which would carry a lesser sentence. In Colombia, femicide \u2014 the killing of a woman because of her gender \u2014 is considered a more serious crime than homicide. Under Colombian law, femicide is often punished with a higher penalty. Defense lawyer Fredy Sp\u00edndola told the Focus Noticias channel that he and his client believe the witnesses \u201cwere all in cahoots, that they all said the same thing.\u201d The victim\u2019s legal team, meanwhile, celebrated the sentence, saying it recognizes that Trespalacios was a victim of various types of violence. \u201cIt is a fair decision for us, which is also consistent with the material evidentiary elements, with the theory of the case that we had from the beginning.

Russia\u2019s Foreign Ministry on Wednesday posted a photo of Lavrov in Ouagadougou, noting that he had been received by acting President Ibrahim Traor\u00e9. Lavrov was accompanied on the trip by Russian Deputy Defense Minister Yevkurov. Burkina\u00a0Faso is\u00a0currently under military rule\u00a0after a junta staged a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in July 2022. Its junta, headed by Traor\u00e9, has said it is prioritizing building up security\u00a0amid an ongoing and deadly internal conflict. Violence-related deaths in\u00a0Burkina\u00a0Faso doubled last year, according to the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC). So far in 2024, hundreds of civilians have already been killed in attacks this year, including around 170 in three villages\u00a0in March, and approximately 30 in separate mosque and church attacks\u00a0in February. Engulfed in violence, Burkina\u00a0Faso has been named the world\u2019s most neglected displacement crisis for the second year, by the NRC. In 2024, 6.3 million people in the country will need humanitarian assistance, the aid organization said, with over two million people internally displaced. US officials have warned for years now that both Russia and China are working to build influence in Africa. In 2019, the former head of US Africa Command, Gen. Thomas Waldhauser also said that Russia was using mercenaries and arms sales to gain access to natural resources in Africa. Isolated from much of the world due to its invasion of Ukraine, Russia appears to be renewing overtures in the continent. In early March of this year, Africa Command again warned Congress that Russia was aggressively working to expand its footing in Africa, and that several countries were \u201cat the tipping point\u201d of falling under its influence. In his comments this week, Lavrov also thanked Burkinabe leaders for their \u201ceffective assistance in resolving issues that allowed us to resume the activities of our embassy in Ouagadougou.\u201d \u201cWe are implementing a program to resume the activities of Russian diplomatic missions in Africa.\u00a0Burkina\u00a0Faso was the first country to do this quickly and effectively,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/africa/russia-burkina-faso-military-instructors-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/09/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_06_asia_north-korea-balloons-activists-kpop-intl-hnk", "text": "South Korean activists sent balloons carrying K-pop and K-dramas on USB sticks to their northern neighbor on Thursday, days after North Korean balloons of trash and \u201cfilth\u201d floated in the opposite direction. The activist group Fighters for a Free North Korea (FFNK) released the giant balloons in the early hours of Thursday morning, with videos showing them floating away, some dragging giant posters visible from afar while others carried smaller plastic packages. Inside the packages were 200,000 leaflets condemning North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, 5,000 USB sticks containing South Korean music videos and television shows, and 2,000 one dollar bills, according to FFNK. Groups such as FFNK have been sending these kinds of balloons for years, carrying items prohibited in the isolated totalitarian dictatorship \u2013 including food, medicine, radios, propaganda leaflets and pieces of South Korean news. In May, North Korea responded by sending its own giant balloons back south \u2013 containing trash, soil, pieces of paper and plastic, and what South Korean authorities described as \u201cfilth.\u201d Pyongyang claimed to have sent a total of 3,500 balloons carrying 15 tonnes of trash to its neighbor, according to state media KCNA, citing North Korea\u2019s Vice Defense Minister Kim Kang Il. Those balloons began landing in the South last week, temporarily disrupting flights and prompting authorities to warn residents to stay indoors. As of Monday, the South Korean military had found about 1,000 balloons. South Korean activists say they will continue to send the balloons north \u2013 even though doing so was banned by the government years ago. FFNK leader Park Sang-hak, a North Korean defector who fled to the South years ago, described the materials they sent as \u201cletters of truth and freedom.\u201d As a young man in North Korea, these balloons had offered him a rare glimpse into the outside world, he said. He recalled being in a public square in 1992 when \u201cI heard a huge balloon in the sky.\u201d \u201cThis round thing suddenly popped with a loud bang, then leaflets fell from the sky. I knew I wasn\u2019t supposed to look at those things, so I put one in my pocket and went to the bathroom to check it out,\u201d he said. The leaflet he pocketed contained stories about North Korean defectors and their escapes, some of whom had crossed into China before heading toward South Korea. Eight years later, Park fled the North \u2013 arriving in South Korea in 2000, and beginning his mission to send balloons across the border in 2006. The leaflets he sends carry information about the Kim family, including the assassination of the leader\u2019s half-brother Kim Jong Nam \u2014 as well as booklets about South Korea\u2019s economic and political development, including photos of the main Seoul airport and the country\u2019s fighter jets. \u201cSouth Korea is not an American colony or a wasteland of humanity like I learned in North Korea,\u201d he told CNN on Wednesday. \u201cWe sent money, medicine, facts, truth, and love, but to send filth and trash in return? That\u2019s an inhumane and barbaric act.\u201d Meanwhile, some South Korean residents living near the border are now on edge. \u201cI lived through the Korean War and other difficulties, and I was worried \u2026 What if we have another war?\u201d said 84-year-old Song Kwang-ja, a resident of Yongin city, on Thursday. \u201cThat reminded me of the old days. I still get goosebumps thinking and talking about it,\u201d she said, adding that the balloons \u201cfelt like a childish prank.\u201d The incident has also worsened strained relations between the two countries. South Korea announced this week it would resume \u201call military activities\u201d near the demarcation line \u2013 suspending a 2018 agreement signed by both nations at a brief time of relatively warm relations.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/asia/north-korea-balloons-activists-kpop-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/09/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_08_style_jewel-art-music-healing-exhibition-crystal-bridges", "text": "Walking through \u201cThe Portal\u201d \u2014 the immersive art experience that I have created at Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, Arkansas \u2014 is like stepping into a mandala. It embodies my true life\u2019s work: how to heal a broken heart. Working with the team at Crystal Bridges to bring this experience to life reminded me of when I was 18 years old, and was \u201cdiscovered\u201d singing in a small coffee shop in San Diego, California. Back then, Atlantic Records president Danny Goldberg saw something in me, and decided to believe in me. An entire record label ended up rallying behind me and fought alongside me to make my first album, \u201cPieces Of You,\u201d work against all the odds. It was magic. I\u2019m now old enough to know that a person doesn\u2019t always get a magical moment in their life, much less two \u2014 I know the art world has not been sitting around hoping that a folk singer will paint. Or sculpt. Or create an experience weaving together music, behavioral health and wellness, in a fine-art museum, no less. Yet director Rod Bigelow, curator Alejo Benedetti and the entire Crystal Bridges team also chose to believe in me, and work incredibly hard to bring this vision to life. The gratitude I felt standing before the museum\u2019s front doors on opening night nearly brought me to my knees. It did bring me to tears. A journey of art, and affirmation At 40 years old, I decided to take a step back from my career. I quit touring and recording; I was a single mom coming out of a difficult divorce, and I was still recovering financially from the ruin I found myself in after my mom and I parted ways. I had no good strategy for picking myself up again and expecting a different outcome \u2014 I was waving the white flag. I surrendered to going within and learning how to heal in a new way. I created behavioral exercises; I painted and I wrote. But not for the world. For me. Art has always been a medicine I made to heal. Since I was young, I dove into journaling, poetry, and music to help myself understand the painful blows life dealt. I turned to melodies to comfort me at night when I left home at 15. I wrote many of my biggest hits during this time \u2014 songs like, \u201cAngel Standing By,\u201d \u201cHands,\u201d \u201cWho Will Save Your Soul,\u201d and \u201cYou Were Meant for Me.\u201d I also began to carve marble, mold clay and draw around the same time I began writing songs. It helped me synthesize my pain, and I found the different mediums all worked like their own unique tincture. Art is how I turned the poison into medicine, the snake bite into an antidote.\u00a0It helped me understand the world around me \u2014 and who I was independent of it, from the inside out. And so for \u201cThe Portal,\u201d I wanted to focus on that moment when I hit pause on my life, and to bring audiences on my journey from that point to today, 10 years later. It is a journey through what I call the \u201cThree Planes,\u201d a personal philosophy I\u2019ve developed centered around the idea that we each travel through three realms of reality each and every day, often without knowing it: The \u201cInner Plane,\u201d representing our thoughts and feelings; the \u201cSeen Plane,\u201d representing our physical lives \u2014 jobs, families, finances, nature, structure; and the \u201cUnseen Plane,\u201d representing whatever gives a sense of awe and wonder. For some, it\u2019s a clearly-defined spiritual belief or relationship, for others it\u2019s just a feeling, like getting goosebumps when you see images from the James Webb Space Telescope. Multidisciplinary mindfulness Walking through the experience, visitors are guided by a variety of different artworks I have selected to help them define what these realms mean to them (and to me). First, they are greeted by \u201cListen,\u201d a holographic video installation \u2014 brought to life by Protohologram, and pictured above \u2014 I designed to represent the \u201cUnseen Plane.\u201d It incorporates spoken words of a poem I wrote when I pushed that pause button and asked for help. In that moment, I felt like I was not alone. I was comforted, and I was guided to listen with my heart. In the museum\u2019s contemporary art wing, they\u2019ll see an original oil painting, called \u201cDouble Helix,\u201d representing the \u201cSeen Plane.\u201d This is the first time I have ever shown my art; to get to do so in such a prestigious museum setting is a major pinch-me moment. The painting is about my devotion to my son, and of letting go of my music career so I could be fully present for him. After my divorce, I knew my son needed me in a way that was essential \u2014 and I knew if I did not prioritize that need, I would look back and regret it. And I had faith that when it was time to re-start my creative career, I would be led to find a way forward. Here, there is also a sculpture I made titled \u201cCHILL,\u201d made of lucite and filled with a variety of medications. It represents the \u2018Inner Plane,\u2019 and is about the intersection of wellness and medicine; about longevity of life versus quality of life, and my own inner journey of learning how to unwind. Next, visitors are given a journal and invited to walk through the contemporary gallery, in which I was honored to curate 10 pieces from the museum\u2019s permanent collection. It\u2019s here \u2014 and inspired by these artworks \u2014 where I ask them to write down answers to prompts and questions that helped me heal over this past decade. One such prompt, for example is to fill in the blanks to a sentence that changed my life: \u201cI sacrifice my attachment to _____ and I dedicate it to _____.\u201d I use this prompt every day; what I have chosen to work on is sacrificing my attachment to perfectionism and dedicating it to noticing what is going right. The journal is for each visitor to keep. It has open space to draw and reflect more if they choose. One of my goals in this part of the experience was not just to help provide some structure and behavioral health tools, but to create space for community, connection and conversations.\u00a0 It was so rewarding for me to see couples, families and even strangers engaged in meaningful discussions with one another \u2014 I saw parents with tears in their eyes because they got a glimpse into their child\u2019s inner world; grown men hugging after a shared experience neither of them knew the other carried. Finally, visitors are brought outside to watch a 200-piece drone show flown by Nova Sky Stories. In the night sky, these drones create sculptural shapes, choreographed to an original 10-minute piece of music. I feel this music is the most dynamic and interesting of my career. It goes from spoken word to cinematic soundscapes,\u00a0and in and out of several new songs. Why drones? I used them because I know they have the power to create a sense of awe. There is a lot of science behind the power of awe. For me, creating this show and seeing 300 people all with their faces turned to the sky in wonder, their mouths agape, was a magical moment. It is my hope that people leave feeling more connected to themselves and those around them. What it has done for me personally is to finally allow these three areas of my life to come together in one space: to bring my music forward in a new way, to let my visual art be seen by the world for the first time, and to share the tools I\u2019ve created and used to heal. We do not heal through therapy alone. We do not heal through art alone. We do not heal through connection to self or community alone. It happens all together.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/08/style/jewel-art-music-healing-exhibition-crystal-bridges/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/09/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_06_middleeast_israel-airstrike-un-school-gaza-intl-hnk", "text": "Dozens of people were killed by an overnight Israeli airstrike on\u00a0a United Nations-run school in central Gaza, authorities said, in an attack that CNN analysis found was conducted with a US-made weapon. The school, run by the UN agency for Palestinian refugees\u00a0(UNRWA), was housing displaced people in the Nuseirat refugee camp at the time of the incident, the Gaza government media office said. At least 40 people were killed in the strike, according to medical workers at the nearby Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital. Authorities at the hospital said casualties could rise as victims were still being brought to the hospital on Thursday morning. The Israeli military confirmed it carried out the airstrike, which it said targeted a Hamas compound operating inside the school. Israeli military spokesperson Lt. Col. Peter Lerner later told journalists the military was not \u201caware of any civilian casualties.\u201d Lerner said \u201c20 to 30 Hamas and Islamic Jihad\u201d militants were targeted in the strike, and that those targeted were \u201cusing the facilities to plan and execute attacks\u201d against Israeli forces. Militants who were involved in the October 7 attacks on Israel were among those killed, Lerner said. Later on Thursday, the Israeli military said it had so far identified nine alleged Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters targeted in\u00a0the strike. CNN cannot independently verify any of those claims or the identities of the nine people the IDF said it identified. A CNN analysis of video from the scene and a review by an explosive weapons expert\u00a0found that US-made munitions were used in the strike on the school. CNN identified fragments of at least two US-made GBU-39 small diameter bombs (SDB) in video filmed at the scene by a journalist working for CNN. \u201cYou can determine that GBU-39s were used in Nuseirat because just as seen at the Rafah strike, you have the tail actuator section with the distinct bolt and fin slot,\u201d Trevor Ball, a former US Army explosive ordnance disposal technician told CNN Thursday. It marks the second time in two weeks that CNN has been able to verify the use of US-manufactured munitions in deadly Israeli attacks on displaced Palestinians, the first being a deadly IDF strike on\u00a0a displacement camp in Rafah on May 26. Asked whether American weapons were used in the strike, US State Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller said Thursday that was a question for the Israeli government. Miller said the US has been in contact with Israel over the strike and that Israel has only told the US \u201cessentially what they have said publicly.\u201d He added that the Israeli government would release more information, which the US expects to be \u201cfully transparent.\u201d Thursday\u2019s attack came after the IDF ramped up ground and air assaults in the center of the strip on Tuesday amid a deepening humanitarian crisis there. Palestinians in central Gaza have reported that the intensity and frequency of Israeli strikes in the last week have felt like the beginning of the war. According to a journalist in the area working with CNN, the school was hit by at least three missiles that penetrated the three-story building. The facility was believed to be housing thousands of displaced people who had taken shelter in the school, its yard, and the surrounding area,\u00a0according to the journalist. UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini said the school was sheltering about 6,000 displaced people. \u201cWe were asleep here, (and) we suddenly saw rockets falling. I went down holding my child, we were both injured, my relative was martyred in that room,\u201d journalist J\ufeffaber Abu Daher told CNN on Thursday. He said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \u201cis killing the civilians, he is not killing militants, it\u2019s innocent people asleep in a UNRWA facility\u2026 what did children and\u00a0elderly do? What did they do to him? He is looking for Hamas people? Go look for them, why are you killing us in schools?\u201d The Israeli military defended the bombing of the school, saying it had so far identified nine alleged militants it had targeted in the pre-dawn strike, its spokesperson Daniel Hagari said Thursday. He said the IDF believes there were \u201cabout 30\u201d militants hiding inside the UN school but did not provide further evidence or information as to how the IDF has come to this conclusion. Hagari added that Israeli forces, using aerial surveillance over several days, had delayed the strike on the school twice because they had identified civilians in the area. \u201cWe conducted the strike once our intelligence and surveillance indicated there were no women or children inside the Hamas compound inside those classrooms,\u201d Hagari said. He also accused Hamas of violating international law by allegedly using the UN school as an operational base. The US State Department said Israel\u2019s strike did not cross US President Joe Biden\u2019s so-called \u201cred line\u201d because that line referred to a \u201clarge-scale operation in Rafah,\u201d which the US has not yet seen. \u201cThat said, we have seen strikes that put civilians in danger well before the president said that, and we have made clear to the government of Israel that we expect them to do everything that they can to minimize civilian harm,\u201d Miller said. The UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned the strike, saying \u201cUN premises are inviolable, including during armed conflict and must be protected by all parties at all times,\u201d according to his spokesperson St\u00e9phane Dujarric. US-made weapon used Gaza authorities said the dead and injured continue to be brought to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, which is operating at three times its clinical capacity, \u201csignaling a real disaster that will lead to a greater increase in the number of martyrs,\u201d the Gaza media office said. UNRWA said its school was \u201cpossibly hit several times\u201d overnight by the strikes. An UNRWA spokesperson told CNN it was not able to confirm Israeli reports that Hamas operatives had been using the school as a compound. \u201cWe remind all parties to the conflict that schools and other UN premises must never be used for military or fighting purposes,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cUN facilities must be protected at all times.\u201d Lazzarini said in a post on X that while \u201cclaims that armed groups may have been inside the shelter are shocking\u201d they have been unable to verify it. \u201cAttacking, targeting or using UN buildings for military purposes are a blatant disregard of International Humanitarian law,\u201d he added. \ufeffMunitions made in the US were also used in the\u00a0deadly Israeli strike\u00a0on\u00a0a displacement camp in Rafah late last month, a CNN analysis of video from the scene and a review by explosive weapons experts found. After that attack, US President Joe Biden refused calls to alter his policy towards Israel, suggesting the deadly Rafah strike had not yet crossed a red line that would force changes in American support. He had previously said in a CNN interview that he wouldn\u2019t allow certain US weapons to be\u00a0used in a major offensive in Rafah. In April, CNN reported that the Biden administration authorized the transfer to Israel of over 1,000 small-diameter bombs, according to three people familiar with the matter. \u2018The situation is apocalyptic\u2019 An Israeli strike hit the same camp last month and killed dozens of people, Al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital said at the time. One woman, Um Mohammad Taha, told CNN then that five houses had collapsed, including her sister\u2019s, and that many were buried under the rubble, including children. And another Israeli attack on the Nuseirat camp in April injured several journalists, including one working with CNN. Doctors Without Borders/M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF), which has supported Al-Aqsa hospital, said Wednesday it had taken in more than 70 people who had been killed, and more than 300 injured, in just 48 hours, amid an escalation in bombing and ground fighting. Karin Huster, an MSF nurse, said in the group\u2019s statement: \u201cWe have seen hospitals being bombed. We have seen refugee camps being bombed. We have seen humanitarian warehouses being bombed. The situation is apocalyptic.\u201d \u201cThe odor of blood when I entered the emergency room was just overwhelming. People are lying on the floor. People are lying outside,\u201d Huster added. \u201cIt\u2019s just an emotionally overwhelming situation.\u201d Israel\u2019s renewed focus on bombarding central Gaza highlights again the elusive nature of its stated ambition to destroy Hamas. The brunt of the Israeli military campaign had, in recent months, moved south towards Rafah, but rocket fire and ground warfare have now again engulfed encampments further north such as Nuseirat and areas like Bureij, both just south of Gaza City. \u201cEvery place we went to after they said it\u2019s safe was struck \u2013 I want the war to stop,\u201d Mohammad Farajallah, a child who said his two brothers were killed in Thursday\u2019s strike, told CNN as he rifled through the rubble of the school. The latest attack also came as American, Egyptian and Qatari officials\u00a0met in Doha to revive negotiations on a new ceasefire and hostage release deal. The meetings follow a\u00a0three-phase proposal\u00a0\u2014 characterized as an Israeli plan \u2014 laid out by US President Joe Biden that would pair a release of hostages with a \u201cfull and complete ceasefire\u201d in Gaza. On Wednesday, Israel\u2019s Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant said the country\u2019s military offensive in Gaza would not be halted for any resumption of ceasefire and hostage release talks with Hamas. \u201cWe are in a process of continuous engagement to wear down the enemy. Any negotiations with the terrorist organization Hamas will only be conducted under fire,\u201d Gallant said in a recorded video statement. This story has been updated to\u00a0revise\u00a0the number of fatalities in the UNRWA school strike. This breaking news story will be updated.

On that cold January night last year, they chatted over champagne \u2013 the first of many meetings that would have Yu fast falling in love. Yu, 41, a clinician and divorced mother of two, soon began spending every spare minute with him at the bar in Tokyo\u2019s main red-light district, dropping thousands of dollars on heavily marked-up alcohol. In return, he showered Yu with attention and small gifts, celebrating her birthday with her and even promising to buy her a ring. \u201cHe said, \u2018You are my girlfriend,\u2019\u201d said Yu, who CNN is identifying by a pseudonym to protect her privacy. \u201cI believed him.\u201d Yu says the host, handsome and in his 20s, encouraged her to run up a bar tab that quickly spiraled out of control. Then, her money ran out \u2013 and everything changed. With no way for Yu to pay the 25 million yen (about $165,000) she owed to the bar, he said he would take care of the debt. But now she would have to repay him \u2013 with sex work the only way to raise the cash. Yu is one of hundreds of women coerced to sell their bodies after frequenting Japan\u2019s so-called \u201chost clubs,\u201d experts told CNN. There are more than 300 of these venues in Tokyo\u2019s neon-lit Kabukicho district, offering male companionship to lonely women. Though not all hosts exploit their female clients, authorities say some clubs are linked to organized crime, while activists say loose regulation of the industry has allowed abuse to fester. Under current laws, anybody over the age of 18 can enter the clubs, and efforts by lawmakers to introduce stronger protections have so far failed. Cases of extreme debt, exploitation and sex trafficking surged after Covid restrictions were lifted in 2023, activists say, with women flocking to host clubs following several years of business closures and isolation. Last year, Tokyo police arrested 140 people for alleged prostitution in Kabukicho, according to public broadcaster NHK \u2013 a threefold increase from the previous year. Of those detained, 40% told police they were soliciting to repay debts run up at host clubs, NHK reported. With such cases mounting, authorities set up helplines for victims and arrested hosts for allegedly coercing indebted customers into sex work. In December, Tokyo police inspected 176 host clubs in Kabukicho, NHK reported \u2013 finding regulatory violations in 75% of the venues, mainly for not clearly displaying the price of alcohol and for placing menus out of sight. \u201cIt\u2019s a romance scam, basically,\u201d said Ayaka Shiomura, a member of Japan\u2019s upper house of parliament, who has unsuccessfully pushed for better safeguards against exploitative host clubs. \u201cSome of these women are brainwashed into thinking they\u2019re dating these hosts. It\u2019s a vicious, bad cycle.\u201d The price of love For many victims, that cycle begins online, especially on social media \u2013 where hosts built their fanbase when pandemic restrictions forced their clubs to close. Mikami Rui, 28, has worked as a host for the past 10 years \u2013 and says for much of his career, the clubs weren\u2019t very well known. But \u201cawareness is spreading in Japan\u201d because of platforms like Instagram, TikTok and X, where hosts are \u201cworking very hard to become more visible,\u201d he said. While he insists he has never forced a customer into sex work, he admits to previously persuading women to spend far beyond their means. Now, he claims, \u201cI entertain women without pressuring them for money \u2026 I stick to what they can afford.\u201d On these apps, hosts identify and flirt with prospective customers to entice them to visit the clubs, said Hidemori Gen, an advocate in Tokyo who provides a drop-in consultation service for victims of sexual abuse and gang violence. Often, hosts target vulnerable young women, draining them of their savings and then coercing them into sex work to repay their bar debts, Gen said. Yu had watched the host\u2019s YouTube videos for two years before going to his club \u2013 that first meeting laying the groundwork for a one-sided relationship of false promises. After that night, he reached out asking to see her again \u2013 so Yu visited the club once more. Soon, he was treating her at restaurants and hookah bars, paying her special attention \u201cover other girls,\u201d she said. He talked about going to the places she wanted to visit, like Disneyland or Japan\u2019s popular island destination Okinawa. This kind of special attention is why victims \u2013 some as young as 18 \u2013 often genuinely believe the hosts are their boyfriends, said Shiomura, the national assembly member. Hosts may have sex with their customers \u201cearly on\u201d to establish intimacy, saying things like \u201cI love you\u201d and \u201clet\u2019s get married\u201d \u2013 some even going as far as meeting the women\u2019s parents, she said. The whole time, Yu was racking up bills she couldn\u2019t pay. Host clubs often offer steep discounts for new customers, luring them in with cheap drinks then jacking up the prices once they\u2019re hooked \u2013 with some bottles of alcohol costing as much as $6,000. Many hosts also encourage clients to keep their bar tab open for weeks at a time \u2013 which is how debts can balloon out of sight. \u201cHe asked me, \u2018How are you going to pay me back?\u2019 and when I said I didn\u2019t know, he said, \u2018Go abroad for sex work,\u2019\u201d Yu said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to. But he said it was the only way and that I could make 8 million yen (about $53,000) a month.\u201d Desperate and depleted of her savings, Yu began working as a prostitute in Japan and the Chinese territories of Macao and Hong Kong. It didn\u2019t feel like she had a choice, she said. \u201cWe worked 10-hour-plus shifts. Every hour, there was a show and I would get picked, then bought. It made me really sad to see about 100 girls, including myself, be bought,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen my body was exhausted or I felt weak, I thought it\u2019d be easier to die. I thought about that a lot.\u201d Overcome with shame and anger at herself, she didn\u2019t tell friends or family about her predicament. Shiomura, the lawmaker, said even when being exploited, many women still view the hosts as their boyfriends and want to support them. \u201cI think it tells you how this mind control runs deep,\u201d she said. No regulations, no relief Gen, who runs the consultation service for abuse victims, says he has seen a fivefold increase of cases like Yu\u2019s in the past year alone. \u201cLast spring, when we came out of the pandemic and the masks came off, that\u2019s when consultations about host clubs increased dramatically,\u201d he said. And laws lag the surge in cases, allowing exploitative host clubs to continue their shady practices. Shiomura last year proposed a bill in parliament that called for government investigations, public awareness campaigns, counseling services and employment assistance for victims. Rejected by the ruling party, the bill failed to pass, with some critics arguing female customers bear responsibility for visiting host clubs and spending irresponsibly. That means it\u2019s largely up to hosts and host clubs to self-regulate \u2013 which some have promised to do.\u00a0Since April, more than a dozen host club operators in Tokyo \u2013 each owning several venues \u2013 said they would refuse entry to women under the legal drinking age of 20 and prevent customers from running up massive debts. Rui, the host, welcomed the measure, saying clubs that break the guidelines should be shut down. But there are far more clubs beyond those owned by the 13 operators that have pledged to follow the new self-imposed rules \u2013 and no such commitment on a national level. Even within Tokyo, Shiomura voiced doubts about whether clubs would honor their promises, and said she would resubmit the rejected bill if the problem continued. \u201cA lot of people say that it is the woman\u2019s self-responsibility. But I wouldn\u2019t dare think that,\u201d she said. \u201cI think there\u2019s a problem with Japanese society that looks at the bodies of such young women, young women in their teens and 20s, as products.\u201d And there is little relief for victims whose lives have already been upended. Yu is no longer seeing the host, who she says released her from her debt after she\u2019d paid back most of it. But with bills to cover and heavy credit card debt, she still feels trapped. \u201cI\u2019m still doing sex work because I can\u2019t afford to leave. I don\u2019t want to do this work. I feel like I\u2019m going to fall apart,\u201d Yu said. \u201cI\u2019ve hit rock bottom. I don\u2019t know if I can start over again.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/asia/japan-host-club-debt-exploitation-intl-hnk-dst/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/09/2024", "section": "world"}}

The Danny Gargan-trained horse broke late on the final turn to take the lead in the 10-horse field with Luis Saez aboard, besting the Kentucky Derby champion Mystik Dan and Preakness Stakes champion Seize The Grey, who were among the favorites for the final jewel in this year\u2019s Triple Crown, along with post time favorite Sierra Leone, who finished third. Dornoch, who entered the race at 17-1 odds, held off a late charge from Mindframe and Sierra Leone to pull off the upset victory in the Triple Crown\u2019s third leg. Dornoch was neck-and-neck with Seize The Grey until the final turn, where he pulled away from the Preakness winner. Mindframe finished the race in second. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge race to win, I lost my voice a little bit, we were riding him down the lane pretty hard,\u201d said trainer Danny Gargan after the race. \u201cSpeechless. He\u2019s such a talented horse, we\u2019ve thought so much of him all along. For him to get us here, and just be a part of it, it\u2019s a special ride.\u201d The victory is the first for Gargan in any Triple Crown race and second for Jockey Luis Saez. Dornoch is co-owned by 2008 World Series champion Jayson Werth. \u201cI would put it right up there with winning on the biggest stage,\u201d Werth said on the FOX broadcast. \u201cHorse racing is the most underrated sport in the world, bar none. \u2026 This is as good as it gets in horse racing; this is as good as it gets in sports.\u201d Saturday marked the first time in the 156-year history of the Belmont Stakes the race was hosted at a different track. It won\u2019t be held at Belmont Park until at least 2026. No Triple Crown winner in 2024 It\u2019s the sixth straight year a different horse has won each leg of the Triple Crown. The surprise Kentucky Derby champion Mystik Dan failed to keep the possibility of a Triple Crown success alive after finishing second at the Preakness Stakes last month. The race was won by Seize The Grey who held off Mystik Dan\u2019s challenge on the home stretch. Despite the two champions lining up at the start on Saturday, the pre-race favorite for the Belmont Stakes was Sierra Leone. The 3-year-old was one of the horses involved in the Derby\u2019s dramatic photo-finish, finishing second behind Mystik Dan after eventually breaking free from a congested group. The Derby, in a news release, said it was \u201cthe closest three-horse photo finish since 1947.\u201d \u201cIf (Sierra Leone) had kept a straight line, it\u2019s hard to imagine he wouldn\u2019t have won,\u201d trainer Chad Brown said, per the New York Post. \u201cBut that\u2019s horse racing, a nice consolation prize would be the Belmont.\u201d The field of stellar candidates racing at Saratoga Springs on Saturday had to contend with the change of track and distance for this year\u2019s race. The Belmont Stakes has become known as \u201cThe Test of Champions\u201d over the years, owing to the mile-and-a-half distance on the big sandy track at Belmont Park, but this year, however, the race was scaled back to a mile-and-a-quarter. The Saratoga Race Course is a shorter distance at 1-and-a-quarter miles, similar to the Kentucky Derby. Belmont Stakes entrants 1. Seize the Grey (8-1)2. Resilience (10-1)3. Mystik Dan (5-1)4.

{"id": "2024_06_05_middleeast_israel-top-court-sde-teiman-hearing-intl", "text": "Israel has transferred hundreds of Palestinian detainees out of the shadowy detention facility of Sde Teiman in Israel\u2019s Negev desert, a state attorney told Israel\u2019s Supreme Court on Wednesday during a first-ever hearing about the facility where prisoners from Gaza have allegedly been held under conditions of extreme abuse. State attorney Aner Helman told the court that 700 inmates had been moved to Ofer military facility in the occupied West Bank, with another 500 set to be transferred in the weeks to come. Around 200 detainees will remain in Sde Teiman, said Helman, who added that the state would provide an update on their status within three days. The hearing comes in response to a petition by the Association for Civil Rights in Israel (ACRI) and other human rights groups, which drew heavily on CNN reporting about the makeshift prison to make a case for it to be shut down. During a tense exchange, one of the Supreme Court justices, Judge Barak Erez, pressed the state\u2019s legal team on the legality of the way the facility was being run. \u201cThe question is whether or not the Israeli law for the imprisonment of unlawful combatants applies or not. That you did not answer,\u201d said Erez. Avi Segal, an attorney representing the right-wing, Israeli legal organization Shurat HaDin which had asked to join the procedure, said the hearing was based on \u201cnewspaper rumors.\u201d \u201cThe court should be worried about setting up a hearing, and even asking for a response to petitions based on newspaper rumors,\u201d said Segal. CNN\u2019s investigation, in which Israeli whistleblowers as well as Palestinian former detainees and eyewitnesses described horrific conditions at the facility, including continuous blindfolding and handcuffing, sparked an international outcry. The White House called the allegations detailed in CNN\u2019s report \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d and said it was reaching out to Israeli officials for answers. Germany\u2019s Foreign Office condemned the reported practices and said it was campaigning for the International Committee of the Red Cross to access the camp and other prisons. In the wake of CNN\u2019s investigation, United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture and Unlawful Combatants, Alice Jill Edwards, called for Israel to investigate allegations of\u00a0torture and\u00a0mistreatment of detained Palestinians. Last week, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi said the military launched a probe into the allegations of mistreatment at Sde Teiman, as well as at Anatot and Ofer, two other military detention camps for Palestinians from Gaza. The committee tasked with examining the conditions of Palestinian detainees from Gaza is set to submit its recommendations to Halevi this month. \u201cThey cannot keep holding people there, not even for a short while, not even only 200, and not even one week,\u201d ACRI\u2019s attorney Roni Pelli told CNN after the hearing. Since the start of the war on October 7, 36 prisoners held at military detention camps have died, according to the IDF spokesperson\u2019s office. The dead included prisoners \u201cwith previous illnesses or injuries caused to them as a result of the ongoing hostilities,\u201d the statement said. \u201cIn accordance with the law and IDF directives, in each case of death of a detainee in an IDF detention facility, a criminal investigation is opened by the Military Police,\u201d the statement added. On May 10, CNN released an investigation into Sde Teiman, a military base in the Negev desert which has doubled as a detention center for Palestinians detained over the course of Israel\u2019s\u00a0war in\u00a0Gaza which was launched after the October 7 Hamas-led attack on Israel. Three Israeli whistleblowers told CNN that Palestinian detainees at the facility were constantly blindfolded and held under extreme physical restraint. Doctors sometimes amputated prisoners\u2019 limbs due to injuries sustained from continuous handcuffing, one whistleblower said.\u00a0The account tallied with details of\u00a0a letter authored by a doctor\u00a0working at\u00a0Sde Teiman published by Ha\u2019aretz\u00a0in April. According to the accounts, the camp some 18 miles from the Gaza frontier is split into two parts: enclosures holding scores of detainees from Gaza, and a field hospital where wounded detainees are blindfolded, strapped to their beds, wearing diapers and fed through straws. In a May 20 response to a petition led by the rights group Public Committee Against Torture in Israel (PCATI), the Israeli government said it is set to \u201creduce the number of inmates held in military facilities in general and the facility of Sde Teiman in particular, with the intention that this facility will be used as a reception, interrogation and initial sorting facility, for keeping prisoners for short periods only.\u201d Responding to CNN\u2019s request for comment on all the allegations made in its May 10 report, the Israeli military, known as the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), said in a statement: \u201cThe IDF ensures proper conduct towards the detainees in custody. Any allegation of misconduct by IDF soldiers is examined and dealt with accordingly. In appropriate cases, MPCID (Military Police Criminal Investigation\u2019s Division) investigations are opened when there is suspicion of misconduct justifying such action.\u201d \u201cDetainees are handcuffed based on their risk level and health status. Incidents of unlawful handcuffing are not known to the authorities.\u201d The IDF did not directly deny accounts of people being stripped of their clothing or held in diapers. Instead, the Israeli military said that the detainees are given back their clothing once the IDF has determined that they pose no security risk.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/middleeast/israel-top-court-sde-teiman-hearing-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/09/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_08_travel_europe-summer-2024-travel-crowds", "text": "Temperatures are rising. Hotel prices are exploding. And travelers are already behaving badly. Welcome to another summer in Europe. From the headlines, things already look chaotic. Famous sites are raising their entry fees. Hotel rooms are like gold dust. And the dollar has slipped against both the pound and the euro. Oh, and there\u2019s the small matter of crowds. \u201cThere\u2019s been a substantial increase on last year\u2019s demand,\u201d says Tom Jenkins, CEO of the European Tourism Organisation, speaking about US travelers to Europe. \u201c2023 saw higher numbers than 2019, and this year we\u2019re comfortably seeing more \u2013 record volumes of Americans coming to Europe.\u201d Kayla Zeigler agrees. As the owner of Destination Europe, she is sending \u201crecord numbers\u201d of clients to the continent this year. Graham Carter, director of Unforgettable Travel, a tour operator with a 90% US client base, says that many guests are finding the idea of Europe prohibitively expensive this year. \u201cPeople are wondering, is Europe worth it?\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s booking up in advance and prices are quite high. There\u2019s been such a huge demand for travel in the past three years, and lots of places are pushing up prices.\u201d Is summer in Europe already a washout? According to the experts, that all depends on what kind of sacrifices you\u2019re prepared to make. A weak dollar First things first: travelers from the US are already at a disadvantage due to a weak dollar. Against the euro, $1 was worth around 91 or 92 euro cents as of June 5, at mid-market rates. Sure, that\u2019s better than the December 2020-January 2021 five-year low when the dollar was hovering around 82 cents. But it\u2019s also down from a year earlier, when a dollar was worth about 95 euro cents \u2013 and it\u2019s way down from last September\u2019s five-year high when it peaked at 1.04 euros, according to currency conversion specialists Wise. For those traveling to the UK it\u2019s a similar state of affairs. This time last year, $1 netted travelers 80 pence. As of Wednesday, it was 78p \u2013 a fall from the September peak of nearly 83p. The dollar is also down, year on year, against 11 more European currencies. From Bosnia to Bulgaria, Denmark to Iceland, Poland to Romania and Sweden to Switzerland, travelers changing dollars will be worse off. While a few cents to the dollar doesn\u2019t sound much on a single transaction, the small drops can make a difference on credit card bills on the return home. A 500 euro hotel room equates to $543 at Friday\u2019s mid-market exchange rate, where it would have been $480 in September. It\u2019s not all bad, though. In Europe it is up against three currencies: the Czech koruna (21.9 koruna to the dollar last year, to 22.7 currently), the Hungarian forint (from 344.7 to the dollar last year, to 359.4 this year), and the Ukrainian hryvnia, though few will be considering Ukraine for a vacation this year. One currency the dollar is unusually strong against is the Turkish lira. Last June, visitors were swapping one dollar for 21 lira; this week, they\u2019re getting 32. \u2018Spectacular\u2019 hotel price hikes\u2026 On the ground, inflation is up, and entrance fees are rising. The Eiffel Tower will put up prices by 20% from June 17, Istanbul\u2019s Hagia Sophia now charges 25 euros for entry; Venice is charging day-trippers 5 euros on peak dates. Entry fees pale in comparison to hotel bills however. Jenkins says that prices have risen \u201cquite spectacularly\u201d in major cities, and Tim Hentschel, CEO of HotelPlanner.com, agrees. \u201cA lot of the time we\u2019re seeing hotels for $500 a night that were $300 last year,\u201d he says. However, that\u2019s not necessarily because hotels have randomly increased their prices. It\u2019s down to high occupancy levels, he says. As hotels fill up, their remaining rooms get more expensive. \u201cIt\u2019s become, how much can the hotel sell that last 10% of inventory. Rates really begin to spike because of compression,\u201d he says. \u201cSo once you hit 90% occupancy, a $350 room can spike to $500. It\u2019s not like the whole hotel sold at $500 \u2013 a lot sold at $250. It\u2019s the procrastinators paying $500.\u201d He should know \u2013 he\u2019s a self-described procrastinator. Data from Hotel Monitor, American Express Global Business Travel\u2019s annual analysis of worldwide hotel rates, backs his theory up. Its industry predictions for 2024 suggest many major European cities should see room rates increasing by around 10%. Paris, Amsterdam and Dublin were all predicted to be 10-11% higher, with Berlin, Stockholm, Barcelona and London all up by over 9%. Bottom line: stop procrastinating. The good news is that Hentschel says that these price hikes aren\u2019t across the board; instead, they\u2019re at the higher end. That\u2019s why his advice is to drop down the star ratings to find a good deal. \u201cOne and two star hotels don\u2019t have the pricing power,\u201d he says. The same goes for hotels a little further from the destination. \u201cGo to Murcia not Marbella, Milos instead of Mykonos,\u201d he says. \u201cYou get the same sunsets, the same Instagram pictures for a tenth of the price. These aren\u2019t downgrades \u2013 they are places that haven\u2019t made the top 10 list of Conde Nast for the past 10 years.\u201d If you\u2019re looking to stay in a city, try a town further out, he says. In London, for example, five stars are hitting as much as \u00a31,000 (about $1,270) per night. \u201cBut if you go outside the M25 (London\u2019s outer ringroad), three- and four-star hotels are having a tough time getting \u00a3100 a night.\u201d His top tip for London? Windsor, home to the royals and just 29 minutes by train from Paddington station. The sweet spot? A three star hotel in a secondary destination. That should net you a good deal \u2013 even in the terrible summer of 2024, he says. \u2026But cheaper airfares It may not feel like it, but US-Europe airfares are trending lower, says Hayley Berg, lead economist at Hopper. Her data \u2013 which collates all worldwide flight fare searches \u2013 shows that the average air fare from the US to Europe this summer is down 16% on 2023 to $892 round trip. In fact, she says, \u201cEurope is on sale this year.\u201d For the major destinations, it\u2019s even better. Hopper data from June shows that the average return flight from the US to London is down 21%, year on year. On the continent, prime destinations Rome, Barcelona, Athens, and Paris have all seen whopping double-figure drops: by 34%, 37%, 28% and 38% respectively for fares in June, July and August. None of these fares are exactly giveaways. Prices are still higher than in 2019, but are aligned with 2017 and 2018, suggesting that the wild post-pandemic price hikes might be over. Berg calls it \u201ca path back to normal prices.\u201d Far from the madding crowds Did someone mention the crowds? With numbers spiking and anti-tourism measures in place from Venice\u2019s daytripper fee to Mallorcan residents staging protests, some people want to stay away from the obvious European destinations. Jenkins speaks of a \u201csoftening in demand\u201d for the \u201cmain cultural cities.\u201d Carter\u2019s clients try to avoid July and August because of the crowds and heat, preferring May, June and September. But even in those less-busy months, crowds are a concern this year. \u201cWe\u2019re getting a lot of people wanting to avoid the Venices, Romes, Florences,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople are saying, \u2018We still want to visit Italy but we want to avoid the crowds.\u2019\u201d They\u2019re doing the right thing. 2023 saw 134 million \u201carrivals\u201d in Italy \u2013 the highest visitor numbers in history, according to data from Italy\u2019s tourism ministry. Half of those were foreign visitors, and the signs are that 2024 will surpass them, thanks to what tourism minister Daniela Santanch\u00e8 has called a \u201ctargeted strategy.\u201d Zeigler says that any client booking a popular destination this year is getting a reality check before they go. \u201cWe prepare our clients who are visiting tourist-heavy destinations about the crowds, and in many cases we plan their touring and activities around peak crowd times for them to try to have the most pleasant experience possible,\u201d she says, adding that she is booking them accommodation slightly outside of the prime locations: Praiano and Ravello, for example, instead of Amalfi and Positano, for those visiting the Amalfi Coast. Carter is sending his reluctant travelers to more rural regions, like Puglia and Sicily, or advising them to try a different country entirely \u2013 Slovenia instead of Italy (for its mountains and wineries) and Croatia instead of the Greek islands. Ireland and Portugal are also increasingly popular for his clients. Jenkins has a novel suggestion: France. Olympics host cities tend to see a drop in tourism around the Games, he says \u2013 and since Paris is the main attraction for visitors to France, he thinks regional France will be less busy than usual. His prediction appears to be coming true: although the Amex GBT analysis predicted a 11% spike in Paris hotel rates this year, so far they have only risen 8%. That 38% drop in airfare to the city\u2019s Charles de Gaulle airport is looking very tempting. For those sticking to the usual destinations, add-ons and activities are where travelers are really being hit this year, says Hentschel, who just booked an Amalfi Coast trip for a client \u2013 including a 60-minute massage for $400. \u201cTravel is at historic highs and inflation is high,\u201d he says. \u201cActivities have skyrocketed.\u201d They\u2019re also selling out fast \u2013 so if you\u2019re wanting to book, be quick. Zeigler says that on-the-ground costs are around 30% more than they were in 2019 for her clients. Is now too late? So is there still time to plan a European summer, or is it too late? Book that flight fast, advises Berg; prices are only going to go up. Or, \u201cIf you\u2019re flexible, go for September\u201d \u2013 she predicts a similar year-on-year fare drop in addition to the regular 10-30% autumn price fall. Alternatively, wait a year \u2013 Berg predicts that US-Europe fares will remain the same or go down for 2025. Hentschel advises late bookers to try \u201calternative accommodation\u201d \u2013 dropping a star rating, staying further away, or trying something like a B&B. Carter says that there are still \u201cpockets\u201d of availability in July and August but warns that clients shouldn\u2019t expect last-minute deals. But with refreshing honesty, he advises people to wait. \u201cI just wouldn\u2019t bother with summer \u2013 I\u2019d look at autumn 2024 or spring 2025 if you want to get some value out of the trip. \u201cI think summer this year, you\u2019re just going to get stung.\u201d As Hentschel says, \u201cThe further in advance you book, the more you save.\u201d As numbers continue to rise in Europe, make that your travel motto for the future.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/08/travel/europe-summer-2024-travel-crowds/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/09/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_07_americas_panama-migrants-darien-gap-intl-latam", "text": "Panamanian figures show at least 174,513 migrants crossed the treacherous Dari\u00e9n Gap, a mountainous rainforest region connecting South and Central America, from January to June 6 of this year. The latest figures are higher than around the same period in 2023, when more than 166,000 crossings were reported, according to Panama\u2019s National Migration Service. The Dari\u00e9n Gap, which a decade ago was seen as an almost impassable barrier, has continued to see an increase in the number of migrants willing to risk their lives and safety to cross it. According to migration service figures, a record 520,000 people crossed the jungle last year. Experts say many continue to journey towards the United States in search of better opportunities. The National Migration Service of Panama said Thursday that in the first six days of June 2024, at least 4,499 people \u2013 3,598 adults and 901 minors \u2013 arrived in the country. This comes as the number of children crossing the Dari\u00e9n Gap has increased by 40% this year, putting the route on track to see record levels of child migration for the fifth consecutive year, according to a report by the United Nations\u2019 children\u2019s agency. The UNICEF report added that in the first four months of 2024, over 30,000 children crossed the Dari\u00e9n Gap, and that 2,000 were unaccompanied or separated from their families. This comes as Panamanian politicians seek to harden the country\u2019s borders. During his election campaign, Panama\u2019s president-elect Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino said that he wanted to \u201cclose the Dari\u00e9n,\u201d citing safety concerns. He explained in early May that he had proposed to initiate \u201ca repatriation process with full respect for human rights\u201d for the hundreds of thousands of migrants who pass through the area each year. \u201cSo that those from there, and those who would like to come, know that those who arrive here will be returned to their country of origin,\u201d Mulino said. Mulino\u2019s plan may prove unfeasible given that the jungle is 266 kilometers (165 miles) long. Discouraging migrants from crossing could be a tough challenge since many of them pay human smugglers operating on both sides of the borders. \u201cIn practical terms, trying to reduce migration through the Dari\u00e9n is a difficult task. The complexity is not just about entry points, but how to manage and have better information on who is helping migrants get through,\u201d Ariel Ruiz, a policy analyst at the Washington-based Migration Policy Institute, told CNN. The 66-mile (106-kilometer) hike through the Darien Gap brings migrants from Colombia to Panama and is a crucial passage for those hoping to reach the United States and Canada. Mass migration across the Western Hemisphere has\u00a0fueled a growing number\u00a0of people moving north. The journey carries multiple risks for migrants, including robberies, assaults, kidnappings, diseases, wild animal attacks, and accidents in a jungle full of rivers, mountains, and mud flats, according to the UN Refugee agency, UNHCR.

{"id": "2024_06_06_weather_california-heat-dome-west-record-climate", "text": "A searing heat dome will reach peak intensity Thursday afternoon and usher in the hottest day of the year so far for millions in the western US. Temperatures Thursday topped out up to 25 degrees above what\u2019s normal for the time of the year, making it feel like a hot July day in many locations. Heat will continue through the weekend before easing off a bit early next week. However, many typically hot areas in the West will still have to contend with temperatures up to 10 degrees above normal. A robust heat dome \u2013 a large area of high pressure that parks over an area, traps air and heats it with abundant sunshine for days or weeks \u2013 is driving this prolonged, unseasonable heat. TRACK IT: Where the heat will be hottest this week The temperatures will be dangerous for those exposed to the elements and unable to cool off.\u00a0Relief from the heat won\u2019t be found at night, either \u2013 another symptom of a world warming\u00a0due to fossil fuel pollution. Excessive heat warnings are in effect for more than 18 million people in California, Nevada, Arizona and Utah. A majority of these warnings, which are the most extreme form of heat alert issued by the National Weather Service, remain active through Friday. Heat has already taken its toll. Multiple people in different parts of the US have died due to heat-related illnesses since last weekend. Four migrants died \u201cfrom heat stroke and dehydration\u201d while triple digit temperatures baked the US-Mexico border last weekend, according to the US Border Patrol, El Paso Sector. In the East, a 59-year-old man died of heat-related complications in Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland, officials said Wednesday. Additional details about the man\u2019s death, which was the state\u2019s first heat-related death of the year, were not released. Heat also proved challenging for firefighters battling a blaze in California\u2019s Napa County Wednesday. Four firefighters were sent to area hospitals for injuries related to difficult terrain and \u201chot summer conditions,\u201d according to\u00a0CAL Fire\u2019s Sonoma-Lake-Napa Unit. All four are expected to make full recoveries. More than a dozen daily high temperature records fell earlier this week in the West as the heat dome strengthened. A few dozen more could be broken through the weekend. Flagstaff, Arizona; Reno, Nevada; and Fresno, California, are just a handful of cities where the day\u2019s high temperature record could fall on one or more days this week. Phoenix sizzled Wednesday but fell just short of its first 110-degree day of the year, a threshold it blew past Thursday as it soared to 113 degrees, also smashing the city\u2019s previous record for the day by 2 degrees. High temperatures hit 111 degrees in Las Vegas, tying this year with 2010 for the earliest such reading on record in the city. Death Valley, the hottest place in the world, clocked in with a temperature of 122 degrees, topping a daily record of 121 degrees it set back in 1996. Even the brutal desert landscape doesn\u2019t typically get this hot until mid-to-late June. Triple-digit temperatures will persist in California\u2019s Central Valley into the weekend with 110s sticking around in desert areas of California, Nevada and Arizona. Summerlike heat will expand northward Friday and reach the Northwest. Records could be broken in parts of Oregon, Washington and Idaho from Friday through the weekend. While it won\u2019t be record-breaking, Seattle will contend with high temperatures in the upper 70s Friday and could come close to 80 degrees on Saturday. Highs like these are 10 degrees warmer than what\u2019s typical for early June.

The new themed land, called Fantasy Springs, combines the worlds of three popular Disney movie franchises \u2013 \u201cPeter Pan,\u201d \u201cFrozen\u201d and \u201cTangled.\u201d Spanning 140,000 square meters and built at a cost of $2 billion (or 310 billion yen), it\u2019s the eighth \u201cport\u201d in DisneySea and is the park\u2019s largest expansion since opening in 2001. (The resort\u2019s original Tokyo Disneyland park \u2013 owned by Oriental Land Co. Ltd. \u2013 opened its doors in 1983 and was the first Disney park to be built outside of the United States.) A few Disney firsts Visitors to the new port first head through a tunnel passage made of rocks shaped like Disney characters from the three film franchises that inspired Fantasy Springs. Behind the waterfall at the entrance, called Magic Fountain, sits four new rides, a new hotel and eight new dining outlets (including three inside the hotel). One of the most anticipated additions inside Fantasy Springs is undoubtedly Rapunzel\u2019s Forest, Disney\u2019s first Tangled-inspired themed area. Visitors can tour the kingdom of Corona, visit the tower where Rapunzel lives and relive the love story between Rapunzel and thief Flynn Rider on a five-minute gondola ride called Rapunzel\u2019s Lantern Festival. The Snuggly Duckling, a tavern named for and designed like the speakeasy featured in the movie, serves the likes of cheeseburgers and German-style pancake desserts. Peter Pan\u2019s Never Land Adventure Elsewhere in Fantasy Springs, Peter Pan\u2019s Never Land Adventure is a new ride that allows visitors to join \u201cboy who never grows up\u201d alongside Tinker Bell and the Lost Kids on a quest to save John Darling \u2013 a main character in the 1953 movie  \u2013 from Captain Hook and his pirates. It isn\u2019t the first Peter Pan ride to appear in the Tokyo Disney Resort \u2013 Peter Pan\u2019s Flight can be found nearby at Tokyo Disneyland. But Disney promises guests won\u2019t suffer from deja vu; the new six-minute attraction \u201cseamlessly blends ride vehicle motion with show elements and all-new animation, including a groundbreaking projection system.\u201d The Peter Pan-themed area inside Fantasy Springs also offers a family-friendly buggy ride through Pixie Hollow, the fairy valley where Tinker Bell and her pals live. Naturally all of those \u201clost kids\u201d still need to eat. Chicken tenders and Pixi Dust soda can be found at the Lookout Cookout restaurant. Or, for something unusual, try the roast beef-flavored popcorn that\u2019s for sale onsite. Frozen Kingdom Frozen Kingdom, meanwhile, uses projection mapping technology to take guests on a journey with the film\u2019s famed sisters, Anna and Elsa. Throughout the six-and-a-half-minute ride, you\u2019ll have a chance sing along to all those hit songs that have haunted parents Spotify lists for the last decade, such as \u201cDo you want to build a snowman?\u201d \u201cFor the First Time in Forever,\u201d \u201cLove is an Open Door\u201d and, of course, \u201cLet it Go.\u201d Nearby, the Royal Banquet of Arendelle is a restaurant inside a replica of the grand Arendelle Castle and is decorated with books and artwork from the world of Frozen. A humbly named bakehouse called \u201cOaken\u2019s OK Foods\u201d serves an array of Scandinavian-inspired baked goods. For those who need a memory refresh, Oaken is the shopkeeper from Wandering Oaken\u2019s Trading Post and Sauna and appears in the 2013 Frozen movie. How to access and stay in the park A one-day Fantasy Springs Magic passport is currently included for guests buying one of Tokyo Disney\u2019s hotel vacation packages or available for purchase by those staying at the new Tokyo DisneySea Fantasy Springs Hotel inside the expansion. The hotel comprises two types of rooms: the 419-key Fantasy Chateau, and the more luxurious 56-room Grand Chateau. There are three dining outlets within the establishment, including a lobby lounge, an all-day dining restaurant inspired by all the Disney forests (from \u201cSnow White\u201d to \u201cSleeping Beauty\u201d) and French restaurant Le Rebellure. Guests not staying at a Disney hotel can obtain a standby pass or purchase a Disney Premier Access pass to enter Fantasy Springs, however, there is a visitor cap.

{"id": "style_omar-diop-lee-shulman-being-there", "text": "In 1967 romcom \u201cGuess Who\u2019s Coming To Dinner,\u201d Sidney Poitier\u2019s dashing doctor is dropped into the lives of the Draytons, a White middle class family, when their daughter arrives home and announces she has a fianc\u00e9. The parents are liberals, but the news is shocking; they\u2019re not sure if they approve of an interracial marriage. No matter that this man is handsome and of spotless character \u2013 he\u2019s Sidney Poitier, for crying out loud \u2013 his presence, in all its Blackness, marks an intrusion, upending this hitherto White space. Now imagine we know nothing about the Draytons. They could be civil rights campaigners or conservatives or card-carrying members of the KKK. And no Hollywood ending is guaranteed. That is the provocative space a puckish Omar Victor Diop finds himself in in \u201cBeing There.\u201d Conceived by British photographer Lee Shulman and Senegalese self-portraitist Diop, the series sees the duo utilize a collection of family photos from 1950s and 1960s America, editing Diop into a series of intimate scenes, both public and private, in spaces where Black people were often shut out. The 60 or so photos, Kodachrome slides purchased on eBay by Shulman years ago, are drawn from his \u201cAnonymous Project,\u201d so named because Shulman has no idea of the identities of any of the people in them. The collection has spurred on multiple side projects, including a book with British photographer Martin Parr, and now \u201cBeing There,\u201d which debuted at Paris Photo in November 2023 and was recently turned into a coffee table book. \u201cBeing There\u201d came to life when Shulman noticed many of the slides contained an empty seat \u2013 presumably that the photographer had vacated to take the photo. \u201cThere was an absence,\u201d he told CNN in a joint video interview with Diop. That they were taken in America circa the civil rights movement, but also of a segregated South, \u201cplayed on my mind a lot,\u201d he explained. That absence became abstracted. The person missing from the seat evolved into a totem of worlds and peoples often excluded from the privileges of White America. \u201cEvery time I saw that chair, I saw Omar in (it),\u201d Shulman added. Though the two photographers had never met, it tracks. Shulman owned a few works from the acclaimed self-portraitist, who has prior experience in this area. Diop\u2019s series \u201cDiaspora\u201d depicts Africans outside of Africa at different points in history (albeit with some contemporary \u2013 often soccer related \u00ad\u00ad\u2013 props). That sense of play and humor continues in \u201cBeing There,\u201d in which an oft-grinning Diop offers a cheeky presence in each still. Shulman and Diop curated the selection together. \u201cWe were looking for images that covered a broad spectrum of life, because it\u2019s a family photo album,\u201d said Shulman. There are signs of wealth: a ski holiday, a Hawaiian jaunt, a trip to the Grand Canyon, alongside more modest adventures like a roadside picnic and a day at the zoo. The camera goes inside homes, capturing Diop in the back of birthday celebrations and lounging with families. However quotidian, that these moments were captured by cameras is a sign of race and class privilege, argued Shulman. Other photographs, by nature of their location, are more charged. Diop splashes around in a public swimming pool; graduates from college; sits in a busy bar. He\u2019s surrounded by White faces as he does so, occupying spaces which were historically segregated in some states. \u201cThe political potential of this series made it very easy for me to jump into this,\u201d Diop said. \u201cWe tend to have this glamorized gaze towards history. And in doing so, we forget how it\u2019s easy not to make room for someone who\u2019s different,\u201d he added. \u201c(The series) is an invitation to look at our lives nowadays and see how many people different from us that we allow into our intimate circles.\u201d Ironically, inserting Diop into these spontaneous shots involved a lot of planning. Period props and costumes were used by Diop in a greenscreen set, with rigs mimicking the lighting of each slide. Digital post-production slotted him into the photographs, approximating the grade and grain of Kodachrome film, along with any shadows, blur and movement in the shot. Dressing up, Diop was struck by how much he looked like his father, who \u201claughed a lot going through the book,\u201d the portraitist said. \u201cHe\u2019d been a student in Europe in the late \u201950s, so he\u2019d been sitting at these tables,\u201d Diop added. \u201cOf course, you can\u2019t really compare (being an African in Europe) with what African Americans went through in the same era, but the idea of being different is something (they had in common).\u201d The collaborators never decided whether Diop is playing the same character in each photograph, or if it was a character at all, and not just Diop appearing as a time traveller. This ambiguity carries over into Diop\u2019s relationship with the lens. \u201cOne of the reasons it works is that gaze he sometimes has towards the camera,\u201d said Shulman, \u201cyou feel that he knows the photographer.\u201d On the other hand, if it\u2019s a case of Diop breaching the space-time continuum, photographs read as if he\u2019s bringing the viewer in on the secret. Likewise, neither resolved whether Diop was a welcome presence or gate-crasher in each scene. Despite having the slides in his possession for years, Shulman still knows next to nothing about their subjects. \u201cAs much as they\u2019re anonymous, they tell us a lot,\u201d he insisted. \u201cEvery time I look at these images, even without Omar in them, I feel these people are looking at us and telling us something about history.\u201d There is another, perhaps unintended, dimension to the photographs. The anonymity of the White people, and Shulman and Diop\u2019s lack of desire to investigate them and their inner lives, forces the viewer to rely on sign and symbol to construct identity. We don\u2019t know their politics, nor how they\u2019d respond to Diop\u2019s presence. Deprived of details, these lives become homogenized; bundled. In doing so, they\u2019re treated like so many people of color were when portrayed by what was, for decades, a hegemonic Western \u2013 and almost exclusively White \u2013 lens, which had a knack for stripping away nuance. Diop\u2019s winking presence, Black and African, seems to say, \u201cLook where I am\u201d but also, \u201cSee how you like it.\u201d Shulman insisted \u201cthere\u2019s no pointing fingers in this book,\u201d while later saying neither he nor Diop \u201cfeel like we own this project\u201d now that\u2019s out in the world and \u201clives its life.\u201d All interpretations are valid, a fact they say excites them. More than 60 years after the photos were taken, much of America appears different now. Gently probing, playfully satirical, Shulman and Diop remind us that much remains the same. \u201cIt\u2019s a very contemporary project,\u201d Shulman said. \u201cIt has a lot of relevance to the world we live in today.\u201d \u201cBeing There\u201d is published by Textuel and available now.", "source": "http://cnn.com/style/omar-diop-lee-shulman-being-there/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/09/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "travel_brazil-bus-stop-chance-encounters", "text": "Tristano always loves telling the tale of how he met his wife Alessandra \u2013 it\u2019s an amazing, continent-spanning love story. For Tristano, this story will also forever be interlinked with another amazing, continent-spanning story \u2013 one of friendship. So whenever Tristano recounts his love story, he begins several years before he first crossed paths with his wife \u2013 in 2012, to be precise. That was the year Italian-born Tristano studied abroad in Sydney, Australia and spent a few days on vacation in Fiji. Tristano loved the Pacific island nation \u2013 the spectacular beaches, the blue waters, the palm trees. Plus, he made a friend: a guy called Gustavo, from Brazil, who was also staying in Tristano\u2019s hostel. The two crossed paths on Tristano\u2019s first night, and immediately clicked. \u201cWe got along very well,\u201d Tristano tells CNN Travel today. Gustavo, it seemed, had \u201cbeen literally everywhere.\u201d And his thirst for adventure was infectious. Tristano sat with Gustavo in the hostel bar for hours, talking about their respective travels. Tristano was impressed and inspired \u2013 and felt he\u2019d found a kindred spirit. \u201cHe was a person that really motivated me to travel more and more,\u201d says Tristano. Post-Fiji, the two friends stayed in touch \u2013 tracking one another\u2019s adventures on social media, and regularly catching up over messaging app WhatsApp. \u201cOver the following years, I traveled to many places where Gustavo had lived or been, so he always gave me tips \u2013 what to do, what not to do, where to stay, which hostels to go to\u2026\u201d recalls Tristano. Cut to 2016. Tristano had three weeks of vacation to use before the year was up. He was considering going somewhere in South America. In one of his regular text exchanges with Gustavo, Tristano mentioned his potential plans. In response, Gustavo said he was actually back in his home country of Brazil \u2013 and planned to be based in Sao Paulo for the next few months. \u201cAnd then it just hit me,\u201d says Tristano. \u201cI thought, \u2018I\u2019ll go to Brazil. It\u2019s a no-brainer, because if I find good flights, I have one person there I know and I can meet up with him again.\u2019 \u201cSo I literally booked flights within half an hour of talking to him. And that was the reason I went \u2013 and how I ended up meeting Alessandra\u2026\u201d A bus stop meeting Tristano started his Brazil adventure in Rio de Janeiro. On his second day there, he decided to walk from his hostel in Ipanema Beach to Rio\u2019s Copacabana neighborhood. Tristano didn\u2019t get far before he realized this walk was more of a trek than he\u2019d anticipated. He checked Google Maps on his phone, and realized he could hop on a bus that\u2019d take half the time. Following his phone directions, Tristano headed to the bus stop. And once he was at what he thought was the right stop, he glanced around at the other people waiting. There were a couple of other tourists, also peering at their phones. And then there was a young woman dressed in what Tristano thought was  \u201cbusiness casual.\u201d She looked like she was en route to work. When Tristano met her eyes, the woman smiled. She seemed friendly and confident. So Tristano approached her and politely asked \u2013 in subpar, apologetic Portuguese \u2013 if he was waiting at the right place for the bus to Copacabana. In English, the woman replied. \u201cYes, you\u2019re in the right place,\u201d she said. Then she smiled again. When she smiled, her whole face lit up, and Tristano couldn\u2019t help but smile back. \u201cShe seemed like a very bright person, always smiling,\u201d he recalls today. The woman at the bus stop introduced herself as Alessandra. As Tristano had guessed, she was en route to work that morning. \u201cI actually never usually went to that bus stop,\u201d Alessandra tells CNN Travel today. (Alessandra and Tristano have requested their last names not be included in this article for privacy reasons.) The day she met Tristano, Alessandra had taken a slightly different route that morning as she\u2019d had to pick something up at the store before work. Before Tristano approached her, Alessandra hadn\u2019t noticed him \u2013 she\u2019d been in commuter mode, focused on the journey at hand. But when Tristano started speaking to to her in his awkward Portuguese, Alessandra found him charming. And then they talked a little as they waited for the bus \u2013 Tristano told Alessandra he was on vacation for three weeks, she asked him how he was finding Rio so far, explaining she\u2019d lived there since she was a kid. The conversation flowed easily \u2013 so much so that when the bus pulled up, Tristano and Alessandra got on together and, in silent agreement, decided to sit next to each other and continue talking. \u201cWe sat together for probably 15, 20 minutes on the bus ride, just chatting casually,\u201d recalls Tristano. It was a brief journey, but just before the bus pulled up at Tristano\u2019s stop, Tristano turned to Alessandra and asked for her number. He suggested to Alessandra it\u2019d be nice to get to know a Rio local, \u201csomebody who can give me good tips.\u201d \u201cI was going to travel to the other areas of Brazil for the next two weeks, but I knew I was coming back to Rio,\u201d he explains. Alessandra was wary of handing out her phone number to a guy she didn\u2019t really know. But she thought Tristano seemed sweet \u2013 and in all honesty, she assumed she\u2019d never hear from him again. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect anything, especially because he was traveling around Brazil,\u201d she says. But Tristano texted Alessandra right away. And over the next couple of weeks, as Tristano visited Gustavo in Sao Paulo and explored the rest of the country, he and Alessandra contnued to message back and forth. A first date in Rio Once Tristano was back in Rio, he contacted Alessandra to ask if she would like to meet for dinner. Alessandra agreed, but then at the last minute canceled \u2013 explaining she had a headache. Tristano wondered if this was an excuse, whether Alessandra wasn\u2019t actually that interested. Still, he suggested they rearrange for the following night. \u201cThen we actually went out to dinner,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd then the rest is history.\u201d Alessandra actually did have a headache the night before \u2013 a throbbing migraine. She was happy the date got rearranged, and looking forward to seeing Tristano again. But she went into the evening with no expectations. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect to feel something romantic, just an opportunity to get to know him,\u201d she recalls. \u201cBut then, well, once we sat at the table, I saw his green eyes shining. And I felt something sparking after that.\u201d Alessandra found Tristano to be a supportive, encouraging listener. They seamlessly segued between fun, lighthearted conversations and more in-depth discussions. \u201cThe talk was very interesting,\u201d Alessandra recalls. \u201cHe was very interested in my life in Rio, and how hard, let\u2019s say, my life was compared to his.\u201d As for Tristano, he loved getting a glimpse into Alessandra\u2019s world and her mind \u2013 and learning more about her and her childhood growing up in Rio. \u201cWe agreed to meet the very next day,\u201d he recalls. \u201cIt was a weekend. And we spent the whole day walking around the lagoon in Rio, eating ice cream, chatting and laughing and just having a very nice time.\u201d In the evening, Alessandra and Tristano went out for drinks, and then to a club together. \u201cThat\u2019s when we kissed for the first time,\u201d Tristano recalls. Tristano and Alessandra were growing closer. But the next day was Tristano\u2019s last in Rio. The two spent all day together, right up until Tristano had to leave. \u201cWhat left a mark on me was the moment we said goodbye,\u201d says Tristano. \u201cAt the metro station, she started crying.\u201d As Tristano consoled Alessandra, hugged her and wiping away her tears, he also felt emotional. Having to leave felt like \u201ca big sadness,\u201d as he puts it. The feeling weighed on him. \u201cAnd it was also a big surprise, you\u2019re like, \u2018How can I feel this after meeting somebody for literally 48 hours?\u2019 So it felt very strong \u2013 and also very uncertain.\u201d Tristano and Alessandra wanted to see each other again, but both said goodbye thinking it might never happen. As he left, Tristano thanked Alessandra for their time together \u2013 something she took to mean things between them had ended before they\u2019d even began. But although Tristano returned to the UK \u2013 where he was living at the time \u2013 he and Alessandra remained in constant contact. They texted good morning and good night. They sent each other photos of what they were up to each day. Before long, they both admitted they were desperate to see one another again. \u201cAnd so only three months later, we decided to travel to Colombia together,\u201d says Tristano. This trip sealed the deal, and it was \u201cthe real start of the relationship,\u201d says Tristano. \u201cSo we kept meeting,\u201d he says. \u201cVisiting different places every three, four months.\u201d \u201cIt was sad, anytime we had to say goodbye,\u201d recalls Alessandra. But they mostly tried to focus on \u201cjust enjoying the time together,\u201d she says. After all, it was still unclear what the future held \u2013 and whether Alessandra and Tristano could build a future across continents. \u201cI always thought, you know, this obviously cannot go on forever. At some point, we\u2019re going to have to decide what we do,\u201d recalls Tristano. \u201cAnd I wasn\u2019t sure either way, because I knew that not being together wasn\u2019t I wasn\u2019t going to be happy, she wasn\u2019t going to be happy\u2026\u201d But the alternative \u2013 one of them moving across the globe to be with the other \u2013 seemed like a big step and a tough decision. A big step After a year of meeting in destinations across the globe, Alessandra came to Italy for the first time, and met Tristano\u2019s family. A few months later, Tristano met Alessandra\u2019s loved ones in Brazil. Things between them seemed to have naturally moved towards something more serious, more concrete. Around this time, in early 2018, Tristano\u2019s job took him from the UK to Germany. As he prepared to move, Tristano asked Alessandra if she\u2019d like to move to Germany with him. Alessandra spent an emotional week debating her response. She felt like her life had turned \u201cupside down\u201d and she jumped back and forth between certainty about her love for Tristano, fear of the unknown and sadness at the idea of leaving Brazil. \u201cIt was such a big move, leaving my family, friends, job, sunny days and the beach,\u201d she says. \u201cI wanted to go, but I didn\u2019t want to give up on my life in Brazil and my family.\u201d \u201cBut after this week, I said, \u2018Look, I have nothing to lose, I better try and if it doesn\u2019t work then I can\u2019t regret something I didn\u2019t do.\u2019 And my mom supported me.\u201d Alessandra\u2019s mother liked Tristano \u2013 and she trusted her daughter\u2019s decision. Some of Alessandra\u2019s friends were more wary, and suggested Tristano was \u201cjust playing with her.\u201d \u201cBut I always followed my heart,\u201d says Alessandra. She believed in Tristano and their future. \u201cIt felt right to jump,\u201d she says. And so in 2018, Alessandra and Tristano moved to Germany together. \u201cI was excited for this new chapter, but also concerned with the German language, which I had zero knowledge of and the winter weather,\u201d recalls Alessandra.\u00a0 \u201cNevertheless, I was lucky enough to find a job in a multicultural agency, which uses English as the main language. And got used to enjoying the cold months with warm clothes and food.\u201d It also helped that Germany wasn\u2019t Tristano\u2019s home country either. He was also learning the language. And living in a third country allowed the couple to experience a new culture together. A proposal 2018 was also the year Tristano asked Alessandra to marry him. He prepared her a multiple course meal in their apartment, presenting each course under a metal food cover dome \u2013 like servers do in fancy restaurants. When he got to what Alessandra assumed was the final course there was a surprise \u2013 it wasn\u2019t a dessert, but a ring. \u201cI was really surprised,\u201d says Alessandra. \u201cAnd then he asked me to marry him in Portuguese, which made it really special to me.\u201d Tristano and Alessandra enjoyed a small wedding ceremony. Then they started carving out a life together \u2013 settling into new jobs and looking towards the future. \u201cWe helped each other to follow our goals,\u201d says Tristano. Last year, in 2023, Alessandra and Tristano welcomed a son together, Gabriele. They\u2019re raising Gabriele to speak four languages \u2013 Italian, Portuguese, German and English. \u201cUntil Alessandra moved to Germany, we spoke English to each other,\u201d recalls Tristano. \u201cBut then we obviously decided, \u2018Okay, we cannot spend our life speaking English. It\u2019s not our native language for either of us.\u2019\u201d The couple vowed to become fluent in one another\u2019s languages \u2013 a vow they kept. \u201cSo now we basically switch between Portuguese and Italian every few months,\u201d explains Tristano. In May, Tristano and Alessandra\u2019s son Gabriele turned one. Earlier this year, Alessandra and Tristano took him to Brazil for the first time, for an extended two month trip to visit family and loved ones. \u201cWe spent many weeks of those two months in Rio. And for the last one and a half weeks we stayed, actually, in the Copacabana area,\u201d says Tristano. Staying there naturally took the couple back to their first meeting, eight years ago, at the Rio bus stop. Thinking back on how far they\u2019d come was emotional for them both. \u201cIt was crazy,\u201d says Tristano. \u201cWe were doing the same bus route with our son. I don\u2019t even know how to describe it.\u201d A life-changing series of events A few days after he met Alessandra at the Rio bus stop back in 2016, Tristano met up with his good friend Gustavo in Sao Paulo. Tristano remembers they both talked about their love lives. Tristano barely knew Alessandra then \u2013 and had no reason to assume he\u2019d ever see her again \u2013 but he still found himself effusing to Gustavo about the woman from the bus stop. \u201cWe shared stories, and I said, \u2018You know, I actually met a girl, Alessandra.\u2019 And I told him about her \u2013 just how interesting she was and so on,\u201d recalls Tristano. Tristano updated Gustavo on his romance with Alessandra as the relationship developed over the next couple of years. He always hoped the two of them would be able to meet, and he often told Gustavo he credited him with putting him on the path to meet Alessandra. In the summer of 2019, Tristano realized he hadn\u2019t heard from Gustavo for a while. He reached out on WhatsApp, but the message went unread and unanswered. \u201cI didn\u2019t think much of it,\u201d says Tristano. \u201cBut then I went on his Facebook page, and I realized that he had drowned during a swimming excursion in Hawaii.\u201d Tristano was in shock. His friend had passed away a few months prior. As they didn\u2019t have any mutual friends, the news had passed him by. Tristano sat at his laptop, reading the words over and over again. With a sinking feeling, he realized he\u2019d never see his friend again, that Alessandra and Gustavo would never meet. \u201cI always imagined that if we were going to have a wedding, with a big reception and so on, Gustavo would be the main person I would thank for meeting Alessandra \u2013 because it was thanks to him that I actually ended up going to Brazil,\u201d says Tristano. \u201cObviously, that could not happen.\u201d Tristano was heartbroken. Amid his grief, he searched Facebook for Gustavo\u2019s mother\u2019s details. He sent her a friend request. \u201cI got in touch with his mom. And I told her about the whole story, and she was very happy to hear that thanks to Gustavo\u2019s passion for traveling and his friends, he made a massive contribution to our life,\u201d says Tristano. Tristano is still in touch with Gustavo\u2019s mother. And he still credits his friend with changing his life. He sees his life story as defined by two serendipitous travel encounters: first with Gustavo, and then with Alessandra. Both stories, to Tristano, illustrate the power of travel and connections. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t traveled to Fiji and met him, I would have certainly not traveled to Brazil in 2016 either,\u201d says Tristano. \u201cAnd my son Gabriele would not be here today.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/brazil-bus-stop-chance-encounters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/09/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_08_americas_edmundo-gonzalez-venezuela-profile-intl-latam", "text": "Restraint is a rare quality for a politician, especially in Venezuela, a country whose recent leaders have been synonymous with vitriolic populism. Hugo Chavez, the late president who still casts a formidable shadow across the country more than ten years after his death, used to speak for hours on his television show,\u00a0Hello President!, while his firebrand successor, incumbent President Nicolas Maduro, is equally capable of clocking 60-plus minutes of uninterrupted oratory when the mood takes him. So it\u2019s telling that the man tasked with challenging Maduro in Venezuela\u2019s presidential election next month is a man of few words. Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia, the official candidate of a large opposition coalition known as the Democratic Unitary Platform, has a habit of answering his questions in single sentences, often stopping before the interviewer has the time to think of a follow-up. It\u2019s an unexpected approach from a presidential candidate aiming to drum up voter enthusiasm in order to take on an authoritarian leader who in the last ten years has dug into power by allegedly rigging elections and\u00a0violating human rights. But Gonzalez is not your typical Venezuelan politician. After decades in the foreign service (he was an ambassador to Algeria and Argentina) and then as a back bench manager for Venezuela\u2019s opposition, Gonzalez was only selected as a coalition candidate because two other opposition leaders \u2013 Maria Corina Machado and Corina Yoris \u2013 had been barred from running and a deadline was looming. \u201cI never imagined I would find myself in this situation,\u201d he told Venezuelan media in late April, shortly after his candidature was formalized. Yet since then, his poise and calm have helped him build a comfortable lead against Maduro, according to recent polls. Opposition, a dangerous business Challenging Maduro\u2019s near total grip on power can be a dangerous business. Over the years, he has jailed or exiled dozens of opposition leaders, some of them for years. And hundreds of people have been killed in political violence in Venezuela in the past decade, often at the hands of state security forces. But most analysts agree Gonzalez represents the best chance that Venezuela\u2019s political opposition has had to dislodge Maduro from power since 2013. His name is already on the ballot for the July 28 presidential vote, and the government has so far shown little appetite for going after him. In October, the Maduro government and the opposition, along with representatives from the United States, signed a comprehensive agreement in Barbados where Maduro pledged to hold free and fair elections in exchange for sanctions relief from Washington. Since then, there have been mixed signals on both sides about the extent of the deal: US-imposed oil sanctions have only partially been lifted and most of Maduro\u2019s close circle is still subject to individual sanctions, while on May 28, Caracas withdrew an invitation for the European Union to send electoral observers to monitor the upcoming vote. Gonzalez claims he\u2019s not worried about possible persecution, telling CNN En Espa\u00f1ol that he is \u201cvery calm, confident although aware of the enormous challenge\u201d the opposition is up against. Asked about the prospect of a repeat of the 2018 election, which Maduro won amid widespread allegations of vote-rigging and a boycott by the opposition, Gonzalez says he hopes pressure from other countries will force Maduro\u2019s hand. Most experts say the international community is unlikely to intervene in Venezuela again after the debacle of the 2019 opposition uprising led by Juan Guaido, the then-opposition leader who swore himself in as interim president and was recognized by more than fifty countries \u2013 only for Maduro to retain power and ride out the storm unscathed. But Gonzalez seems buoyant nonetheless. \u201cFraud, vote rigging, and threats are nothing new for us,\u201d Gonzalez told CNN En Espa\u00f1ol, \u201cBut we\u2019re confident that on the day the opposition vote will be so massive our victory will be indisputable.\u201d His family is not so tranquil. \u201cWe are worried, no doubt,\u201d Gonzalez\u2019s daughter Mariana told CNN. \u201cBut we\u2019re trying to live one day at a time, because if we start thinking of what could happen, this or that, we stop moving,\u201d she said. The biggest question But how to convince an authoritarian government entrenched in power for decades to voluntarily give up control and lead a democratic transition? Gonzalez has never offered an answer to the question that hangs the July vote. Instead of detailing a roadmap to democracy, he has only hinted at what steps he would take should he win in July and the electoral authority effectively certify the result. He said his biggest priorities would be\u00a0taming\u00a0inflation, another of Venezuela\u2019s chronic ills\u00a0and\u00a0currently running at 64% year on year, and restoring trust in\u00a0the\u00a0institutions of power\u00a0such as the judiciary, currently stacked by Maduro\u2019s sympathizers. The fate of the incumbent and his closest allies \u2013 several of whom are under investigation in the Hague for crimes against humanity \u2013 remain in the balance. But amnesty for outgoing officials could be on the table, Gonzalez told CNN en Espa\u00f1ol. \u201cIn all political transitions and political crises, you have amnesty agreements and transitional justice. All the countries who have gone through situations like ours have ended up granting it, so I don\u2019t rule out we could take a similar measure in Venezuela,\u201d he said. While the election is slated for late July, Venezuela law mandates that the winning candidate won\u2019t take office before January 2025 \u2013 creating a delicate 6-month handover period that Gonzalez would have to manage carefully if he wins. \u201cThose six months will be key for him as a president-elect, while the entire state apparatus remains under the control of the regime,\u201d said Sadio Garavini di Tullio, a classmate of Gonzalez who also served in the foreign office and helped manage the opposition in the Chavez years. \u201cEdmundo however can be that person; he can give a lot of guarantees to everyone involved with the regime.\u201d \u201cHe will not be the president of the opposition government, he\u2019ll be the president of the transition government,\u201d Garavini di Tullio said. George Eickhoff, a German diplomat who served as director of the Konrad Adenauer Foundation in Caracas between 2008 and 2013 and remains close to Gonzalez, made a similar point. \u201cEdmundo is a public servant, he knows there cannot be any revenge [against the government],\u201d Eickhoff told CNN. \u201cHe has already started to speak to the other side: for the opposition, Machado is the firebrand messenger to galvanize its base, while Edmundo is an extension of the soft message, he\u2019s very realistic about his task.\u201d Asked about the possibility of vote-rigging by the Maduro regime, Gonzalez was sanguine. \u201cWe\u2019re aware we\u2019re facing an enemy,\u201d he began \u2013 then corrected himself, softening the message: \u201cAn adversary that has no qualms about using any advantage the system gives them.\u201d Grandfather figure The dual message has been visible throughout this first month of the political campaigning period, with Machado, a long-time conservative politician who first ran for president in 2012, holding public rallies in every street, while Gonzalez has dispensed calmness from his home in Caracas. When Gonzalez\u2019s candidature was formalized in April, a portrait of him by Bloomberg photographer Gaby Oraa went viral in Venezuela. It shows the candidate feeding four colorful tropical parrots called\u00a0guacamayas, typical of Caracas. Across the city, citizens routinely feed these wild birds who can display a pet-like loyalty. \u201cThey come every day, two, three, four\u2026 sometimes even ten. They are his friends,\u201d said Mariana, Gonzalez\u2019s daughter. \u201cThe\u00a0guacamayas\u00a0come in the morning and in the evening, he can spend hours just feeding them sunflower seeds. He takes care of them.\u201d His other passions, according to those who know him well, are baseball, the Real Madrid football club, family barbecues, and reading. Fans see in him a grandfather-of-the-nation type figure who could usher in a new era after the political violence of the last decade, pointing to his electoral slogan \u201cEdmundo, president for all\u201d, as well as his age (73) and family situation (he has four grandchildren). Two of those grandchildren now live in Spain, among the more than seven million Venezuelans who have fled the country in recent years. He hopes that an opposition victory in July would encourage at least some of that diaspora to return. \u201cIt\u2019s time for the big Venezuelan family to come together once more,\u201d he told CNN en Espa\u00f1ol. \u201cIt\u2019s time that the adversary is respected as such, and not seen as an enemy,\u201d he added. A message again, of moderation and transition.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/08/americas/edmundo-gonzalez-venezuela-profile-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/09/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_08_sport_stanley-cup-final-oilers-panthers-spt-intl", "text": "Starting Saturday, the Edmonton Oilers and Florida Panthers are set for battle in the 2024 NHL Stanley Cup Final. The Oilers represent a nation synonymous with hockey which hasn\u2019t seen a Canadian team lift the coveted Cup in over 30 years. The Panthers come into the final seeking redemption after finishing runners-up last season. In the end, the oldest trophy in North American professional sports history will be handed over to just one team. Here\u2019s everything you need to know ahead of the best-of-seven series to decide who will lift the famous Stanley Cup. How to watch Game 1 of the Stanley Cup Final will take place at 8 p.m. ET on Saturday, June 8, at Amerant Bank Arena in Sunrise, Florida. Fans will be able to keep across the action on ABC, ESPN+, SN, CBC and TVAS. Riding the hot hand The Oilers have a chance to do something no Canadian hockey team has done since 1993: win a Stanley Cup. And in Connor McDavid, they have the perfect figurehead. The three-time winner of the Hart Trophy, awarded to the NHL\u2019s most valuable player, has been the key driving force in the Oilers\u2019 run to the Stanley Cup Final. The 27-year-old Canadian scored a goal and assisted on another in the Oilers\u2019 clinching victory in the Western Conference Final over the Dallas Stars. McDavid, widely regarded as the league\u2019s best player, now leads the postseason with 31 points (five goals, 26 assists) in 18 games. Drafted with the No. 1 overall pick in 2015, this will be McDavid\u2019s first appearance in a Stanley Cup Final. Now, he has the opportunity to add his name to the Cup, while cementing himself in the history books. McDavid could become the first player in NHL history with seven 100-point seasons before winning Lord Stanley\u2019s Cup for the first time \u2013 he has 982 points (335 goals, 647 assists) in 645 regular-season games. McDavid would become the second player in NHL history to win the Cup after having 100 assists in the regular season, joining the legendary Wayne Gretzky who did it four times as Oilers captain. \u201cThere\u2019s been lots of growing pains, for sure, lots of lessons, and obviously, it feels great to be in this position,\u201d McDavid said. \u201cThis was always part of the plan, and it feels good to be here today.\u201d Edmonton is playing in its first Final since 2006 and is hoping to lift the\u00a0prized trophy\u00a0for the first time since 1990 and its sixth overall. Long gone are the glory years with Gretzky at the helm leading the Oilers to multiple titles, but McDavid and Co. are hoping to bring back some of those positive feelings. \u201cAs far as the way we play, it\u2019s a different style than [the Panthers],\u201d Oilers forward Ryan Nugent-Hopkins said. \u201cEvery series is different. They\u2019re fast-paced, physical, have a good power play. We\u2019ll obviously take some time here to have a look at their game. We only saw them twice and it was probably not our two best games that we played against them.\u201d Team effort For the Panthers, it is a case of redemption. Having lost to the Vegas Golden Knights in the Stanley Cup Final last season, Florida has managed to make it back to the sport\u2019s\u00a0marquee\u00a0event and will be hoping to go one step further. They are the sixth team in the NHL\u2019s expansion era which began in 1967-68 to return to the Stanley Cup Final after losing in the championship round the previous season. Florida has never lifted the sought-after trophy. The Panthers struggled with injuries as their playoff run went on last season, but this time around, they are much healthier and are looking to finally become NHL champions. \u201cObviously, it\u2019s going to be a challenge,\u201d Panthers forward Carter Verhaeghe said. \u201cThey have some pretty special players over there and definitely going to embrace it. I think any time you go against some of the best players in the world, it\u2019s always fun and challenging. \u2026 So it\u2019s going to be a good series, I think.\u201d Led by their captain Aleksander Barkov, the Panthers defeated the New York Rangers in the Eastern Conference Final to book their spot in the final. One man who knows about facing Edmonton in high-pressure scenarios is Matthew Tkachuk, who played for the Oilers\u2019 bitter rivals, the Calgary Flames, for six seasons. Tkachuk faced the Oilers 28 times while with the Flames in a rivalry dubbed the \u2018Battle of Alberta.\u2019 And the 26-year-old says it will take a group effort to overcome Edmonton. \u201cWe\u2019ve got guys that can skate, just like them,\u201d he said. \u201cMcDavid\u2019s probably the fastest guy in the world, so got to be on the right side of him. If you\u2019re even or behind him, he\u2019s going to beat you, so we\u2019ve got to be in front of him at all times and have layers of support.\u201d Full Stanley Cup Final schedule Game 1: Oilers at Panthers \u2013 June 8, 8 p.m. ET Game 2: Oilers at Panthers \u2013 June 10, 8 p.m. ET Game 3: Panthers at Oilers \u2013 June 13, 8 p.m. ET Game 4: Panthers at Oilers \u2013 June 15, 8 p.m. ET (If needed) Game 5: Oilers at Panthers \u2013 June 18, 8 p.m. ET (If needed) Game 6: Panthers at Oilers \u2013 June 21, 8 p.m. ET (If needed) Game 7: Oilers at Panthers \u2013 June 24, 8 p.m. ET", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/08/sport/stanley-cup-final-oilers-panthers-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/09/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "travel_new-beaches-open-paris-olympic-games", "text": "Lying on a sunny beach in France, occasionally sipping an ice-cold beverage, and then jumping into warm water. This must be the French Riviera, right? Or, actually, Paris. In an effort to transform how tourists experience summer in the French capital this July and August as it hosts the 2024 Olympic Games, the city is opening three beaches in its center, bringing a taste of St. Tropez and Nice to more northerly, urban shores. As usual, Paris will open its regular summer beach on the banks of the Seine river. But this year, it\u2019ll be joined by two more along the Saint Martin canal \u2013 a return of a regular fixture in the Bassin de la Villette cultural district plus a newer plage further along. Paris\u2019 city government confirmed to CNN it is confident that the water quality will meet health standards during the game. Pierre Rabadan, Paris deputy mayor in charge of sport and the Olympic games, said the city will deploy 30 testing sites along the Seine and its branches before it reaches Paris to monitor water quality in real time and quickly identify and handle potential pollution risks. For those who still might recoil at the idea of jumping in a city center waterway, there are other options. The beaches are the centerpieces of a program of activities in Paris aimed at creating an Olympic festival for visitors descending on the city during the 2024 summer Games. This has been revealed as Paris, traditionally one of the world\u2019s most popular tourist destinations, faces a potential struggle to lure visitors amid fears of overcrowding and overpricing during the Olympics. An alternative Paris Olympics, for everybody The 2 million-plus residents of central Paris have always had a strong sense of pride in the arrondissement, or district, that they live in. It\u2019s not unknown for residents of the 16th arrondissement and those of the 11th arrondissement to harbor subtle prejudices against each other. The city is planning to harness those rivalries in a \u201cDistrict Olympics\u201d that will pit the fastest, highest and strongest from each arrondisment to finally settle the debate of which neighborhood is best \u2013- at least in terms of sport. But these games are actually open to everybody aged seven and above. Which means you don\u2019t need to live in Paris to participate. All you need to do is pick an arrondissement you\u2019d like to represent. Participants will be separated into four age groups: 7 to 12, 13 to 16, 17 to 35 and those aged 36 or above. From June 22 to July 13, Parisians and visitors can compete in seven different sports: laser run (cross-country running combined with laser pistol shooting), 3x3 basketball, boccia (a Paralympic ball sport) table tennis, 60-meter run, breakdancing, and\u00a050-meter freestyle swimming. Olympic flames For those who just want to party and watch other people, professional or amateur, do the sport, Paris has you covered. The arrival of the Olympic flame to the French capital coincides with France\u2019s July 14 national day \u2013 and the city is throwing a huge party to celebrate. On the day, Parisians and visitors will be able to watch the torch relay at several city center locations. In Place du Colonel Fabien it\u2019ll be soundtracked by a DJ and at Petit Palais, right by the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es. French opera group D.I.V.A will provide the music. In the Paris LGBTQ district of Marais, a bingo drag event is being organized for the viewing party. For those who miss the flames in Paris on July 14 and 15, the torch returns to the French capital for the opening ceremony on July 26. This time the flame will journey down the Saint Martin canal to the opening ceremony on the Seine river, offering the potential of watching it from one of the new beaches. A marathon for all For runners, Paris is offering the chance to run the exact Olympic marathon route between the city center and suburban Versailles \u2013 said to be the first such event in the history of the Games. The event will take place on August 10, with an additional 10-kilometer route for less ambitious participants that will take runners past landmarks such as the Op\u00e9ra Garnier, Place de la Concorde and the Eiffel Tower. The full-length marathon is open to those aged 20 above while the shorter version is open to anyone aged 16 and above. Entry is via a lottery through the Paris Olympic Games app.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/new-beaches-open-paris-olympic-games/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/09/2024", "section": "world"}}

The IDF claimed Tuesday afternoon local time that fighter jets were attacking Hamas targets in the Bureij area \u201cat the same time as ground forces that are operating in a targeted manner and with intelligence guidance,\u201d in the same area. CNN cannot independently verify the IDF\u2019s statement. The Ministry of Health in Gaza said that 15 people had been killed and dozens injured during the Israeli operation, with the casualties occurring east of the Bureij and Al-Maghazi displacement camps. It said the local Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital was overwhelmed with admissions. A CNN producer in the area said that at least six bodies had been brought to the hospital, along with more than 30 injured people. Among those killed were a father and his 12-year-old son, when an artillery shell hit an apartment building east of Al Bureij, according to the CNN producer, as well as a boy and a girl. A woman in her 20s was also killed. The ministry said the number of patients was more than three times the hospital\u2019s normal capacity and that it was unable to bear receiving more martyrs and injuries in light of this dangerous aggression against civilians, children and women.\u201d It called on the World Health Organization to visit the hospital. Witnesses say civilians started to leave the Bureij area \u2013 heading towards the coast \u2013 after military activity there intensified. Another CNN producer reported tank-fire in recent days from the east-west Netzarim corridor that the IDF has carved through central Gaza towards neighborhoods south of Gaza city. He said there had been a limited ground incursion in the same neighborhoods over the past three days. News of the latest assault comes as the former Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett told CNN the war with Hamas had lost momentum and that Israel should pressure Hamas by pushing on with its controversial operations in Gaza\u2019s southernmost city of Rafah. \u201cWe need to act much quicker. This whole war is going on way too long. We could\u2019ve done Rafah three, four months ago. I think a combination of poor execution of the Israeli government and the American administration\u2019s constant slowing down of Israel coupled together made for a very slow and prolonged war,\u201d Bennett told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper. He said that prolonging the war is what Hamas wants, and the only way to get a ceasefire and hostage deal on the table is to put more pressure on Hamas and push harder in Rafah, adding that operations there have not concluded. He said Israel is \u201cpaying an international price\u201d as other countries criticize the war\u2019s humanitarian toll. \u201cWe are trying to conduct the most just war in history,\u201d Bennett said, but \u201ceverybody in the world is double-guessing and telling us how to do it and how they would do it better, but they\u2019re not in our shoes, and we have to defend our citizens first.\u201d Israel launched its military offensive in Gaza on October 7 after the militant group Hamas, which governs Gaza, killed at least 1,200 people and abducted more than 250 others. Israeli attacks in Gaza have since killed at least\u00a036,550\u00a0Palestinians and injured another\u00a082,959\u00a0people, according to the Ministry of Health there.

{"id": "2024_06_07_asia_japan-birth-rate-population-dating-app-intl-hnk", "text": "Japan\u2019s fertility rate, which has seen a precipitous fall for many years, has reached another record low as the government ramps up efforts to encourage young people to get married and start families\u00a0\u2014\u00a0even launching its own dating app. The nation of 123.9 million people only recorded 727,277 births last year, according to new data released by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare on Friday. The fertility rate \u2013 defined as the total number of births a woman has in her lifetime \u2013 dropped from 1.26 to 1.20. For a population to remain stable, it needs a fertility rate of 2.1. Anything above that will see a population expand, with a large proportion of children and young adults, as seen in India and many African nations. But in Japan, the fertility rate has been well below that stable marker of 2.1 for half a century, experts say \u2013 it fell below that level after the 1973 global oil crisis pushed economies into recession, and never recovered. The downward trend has accelerated in recent years, with the number of deaths overtaking births each year and causing the total population to shrink \u2013 with far-reaching consequences for Japan\u2019s workforce, economy, welfare system and social fabric. In 2023, the country recorded 1.57 million deaths, according to the Health Ministry \u2013 more than double the number of births. And Japan\u2019s not having much matrimonial luck, either \u2013 the number of marriages fell by 30,000 last year, while the number of divorces rose. Experts say the decline is expected to continue for at least several decades\u00a0and is to some extent irreversible due to the country\u2019s population structure. Even if Japan were to boost its fertility rate tomorrow, its population will keep falling until the skewed ratio of young people to older adults balances out. Still, the government is now racing to soften the impact, launching new government agencies to focus specifically on this problem. It has launched initiatives such as expanding child care facilities, offering housing subsidies to parents, and in some towns, even paying couples to have children. In the capital Tokyo, local officials are trying a new tack: launching a government-run dating app, which is in early testing phases and will be fully operational later this year. \u201cPlease use it as \u2018the first step\u2019 to begin marriage hunting,\u201d the app\u2019s website says, adding that the AI-matchmaking system is provided by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government. Users are asked to take a \u201cvalues diagnostic test\u201d but there\u2019s also an option to put in the desired traits of a future partner. \u201cBased on your values and the values you seek in a partner, which can be determined by taking a diagnostic test, AI will introduce you to a compatible person,\u201d it said. \u201cWhat cannot be measured by appearance or conditions alone may lead to unexpected encounters.\u201d The app even caught the eye of billionaire Elon Musk, who wrote on X, formerly Twitter: \u201cI\u2019m glad the government of Japan recognizes the importance of this matter. If radical action isn\u2019t taken, Japan (and many other countries) will disappear!\u201d Experts have told CNN this scenario is unlikely \u2013 the fertility rate is expected to even out at some point, and the country will adjust. Japan may look very different at that point, from its demographic makeup to its economy and domestic policies, but it won\u2019t simply vanish. \u201cMarriage is a decision based on one\u2019s own values, but the Tokyo Metropolitan Government is working to build momentum for marriage so that those who think they \u2018intend to get married eventually\u2019 can take that first step,\u201d says the dating app\u2019s website. Users must be single, over 18 years old \u201cwith a desire to get married,\u201d and be living or working in Tokyo, the website says. It also lists the government\u2019s other measures to support couples \u2013 such as providing information on work-life balance, child care and housing support, men\u2019s participation in housework and child-rearing, and career counseling. \u201cWe hope that every single one of you who wishes to get married will think about what being in a \u2018couple\u2019 means to you,\u201d it says.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/asia/japan-birth-rate-population-dating-app-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/09/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_07_uk_rishi-sunak-d-day-event-uk-election-gbr-intl", "text": "Britain\u2019s Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has apologized for leaving the 80th anniversary commemorations of D-Day early in order to film a TV interview, a decision that prompted incredulity and further derailed his floundering general election campaign. Sunak attended the first part of the commemorative events in Normandy, France, on Thursday, but skipped the international ceremony at Omaha Beach, which was attended by other world leaders and veterans of the Allied operation in 1944. \u201cThe last thing I want is for the commemorations to be overshadowed by politics,\u201d Sunak wrote in a long apology on X. \u201cAfter the conclusion of the British event in Normandy, I returned back to the UK. On reflection, it was a mistake not to stay in France longer \u2013 and I apologise.\u201d But the move had already caused anger and disbelief in Britain, and represented another major miscalculation in Sunak\u2019s faltering election campaign. Sunak left the event to record a campaign interview with broadcaster ITV, the network confirmed, in which he defended claims about the opposition Labour Party\u2019s tax plans which fact-checkers and a senior civil servant have said were misleading or inaccurate. More than 20 heads of state and government, and representatives from royal families across Europe, attended the international ceremony, which took place on a day of commemoration 80 years after the Allied beach landings in Nazi-occupied France laid the groundwork for the defeat of Germany in World War II. \u201cLook, I get the outrage. I get that this is a significant mistake,\u201d Sunak\u2019s own veterans minister, Johnny Mercer, told UK newspaper The Sun on Friday, while also attacking what he labelled as \u201cfaux outrage\u201d from Sunak\u2019s critics. The UK was represented at the international ceremony by David Cameron, Sunak\u2019s foreign secretary and a former prime minister, who took photographs alongside French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and US President Joe Biden. Also in attendance was Labour leader Keir Starmer, who was filmed speaking with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during the event. Labour was quick to condemn Sunak\u2019s decision to skip the events, and the gaffe dominated British news coverage of the election on Friday. Speaking to reporters on Friday,\u00a0Sunak\u00a0said that his leaving early was a \u201cmistake,\u201d but added\u00a0that \u201cit\u2019s important though, given the enormity of the sacrifice made, that we don\u2019t politicize this.\u201d \u201cThe focus should rightly be on the veterans who gave so much,\u201d he said, before stating that he \u201cwill always be proud of our record in supporting veterans here in the UK.\u201d Sunak\u2019s campaign began with a rain-soaked speech outside Downing Street and has been beset by questionable decision-making and optically damaging events, all while failing to shift a cavernous poll deficit \u2013 but Thursday\u2019s D-Day error felt like the most perplexing and detrimental moment of the campaign so far. He was already batting back accusations from Labour that he lied about the cost of the opposition party\u2019s tax plans \u2013 a topic in the debate he filmed with ITV on Thursday night. The UK Treasury flatly contradicted Sunak\u2019s claim in a TV debate Tuesday that its impartial officials had calculated Labour plans would \u201cput up everyone\u2019s taxes by \u00a32,000.\u201d Labour\u2019s policy manifesto has not yet been published, and the party says its agenda is fully costed. ITV News said its team had not specifically requested to speak to the prime minister on Thursday, and that the date was in fact put forward by Sunak\u2019s team, despite it falling on the anniversary of D-Day. \u201cToday was the slot that we were offered, we don\u2019t know why. Obviously it\u2019s not our choice, but he certainly returned from Normandy ready to dive back into the campaign,\u201d ITV\u2019s UK Editor Paul Brand, who carried out the interview, stated in an ITV\u00a0report on Thursday night. \u201cYesterday\u2019s D-Day commemorations were about remembering the bravery of all those who serve our country,\u201d Jonathan Ashworth, Labour\u2019s Shadow Paymaster General, said Friday\ufeff. \u201cIn choosing to prioritise his own vanity TV appearances over our veterans, Rishi Sunak has shown what is most important to him.\u201d Sunak is projected to lose the election on July 4 to Labour by a hefty margin, and his campaign has failed to land a decisive moment that could swing opinion polls in his favor. In recent days his efforts were dealt a further blow when Nigel Farage, an architect of Brexit and a populist thorn in the side of numerous Conservative leaders, announced he would lead the Reform Party\u2019s campaign, directly appealing to right-leaning Tory backers to abandon Sunak and vote for his insurgent group. Farage also leapt on Sunak\u2019s lapse in judgment, writing on X that the Prime Minister \u201ccould not even be bothered to attend the international event above Omaha Beach.\u201d In another post, he added: \u201cPatriotic people who love their country should not vote for him.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/uk/rishi-sunak-d-day-event-uk-election-gbr-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/09/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_25_style_zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk", "text": "Above Beijing\u2019s imperial center rises Jingshan, or Prospect Hill. From a pagoda at its modest peak, a panoramic view of the city presents itself. To the south, the dull golden roofs of the Forbidden City crest and fall, pulling the eye southward to Tiananmen \u2014 the Gate of Heavenly Peace \u2014 and the vast square of the same name just beyond. To the east stand the smooth metallic skyscrapers of the city\u2019s business district. To the north, at the top of Beijing\u2019s central axis \u2014 its so-called dragon\u2019s vein \u2014 sit the Bell and Drum Towers, which once acted as the city\u2019s collective timepiece. And stretching all along the western periphery are the calm, tree-lined waters of the manmade lakes, dug by hand for the pleasure of past emperors. It\u2019s this aerial view of \u201cZhongnanhai,\u201d meaning \u201cmiddle and southern seas,\u201d and the surrounding buildings that today\u2019s Chinese leaders prefer you did not see. That\u2019s because the 1,500-acre site of repurposed imperial pavilions and temples, along with gray modern offices has formed the leadership compound for the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP)  since 1950. As the seat of power, Zhongnanhai is often thought of as China\u2019s equivalent to the White House, or the Kremlin. Synonymous with China\u2019s communist party elite, and among the country\u2019s most secretive places, it is ringed by a centuries-old red ochre wall, with countless CCTV cameras periscoping above it \u2014 and patrolled assiduously by security forces in both plain clothes and uniform. A peaceful getaway For Chinese leader Xi Jinping\u2019s imperial forebears, the site served a somewhat different function. While emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties ruled their vast kingdom from within the Forbidden City, they built temples, halls and living quarters in Zhongnanhai; less grandly ceremonial than those of the palace, they were often oriented to take advantage of the views afforded by the area\u2019s tranquil waters and carefully planned gardens. Many of these emperors came to favor passing their days surrounded by drooping willows in the cool and quiet of this cultivated pleasure garden. A story relayed by the scholar Geremie Barm\u00e9 in his book \u201cThe Forbidden City\u201d tells of the 18th-century Qianlong Emperor\u2019s daily routine at Zhongnanhai: Each morning, after a first breakfast of cold swallows nest soup, he would travel by heated palanquin to the gardens\u2019\u00a0Studio of Convivial Delight,\u00a0a pavilion he built to capitalize on the view of the South Lake, where he would breakfast again on a meal of\u00a018 dishes. As the historian and author of \u201cThe Shortest History of China,\u201d Linda Jaivin, told CNN via email: \u201cThere is something outrageous and yet poetic about the incredible coordination and effort required of a team of bearers, cooks and attendants, just so that an emperor could come, catch a view of the magnificent Ocean Terrace, scoff his food and (leave).\u201d The first ruler to view Zhongnanhai as primarily a place to govern from, not simply relax in, was the Empress Dowager Cixi, who effectively controlled China for almost five decades from 1861. She lived for many years in the gardens\u2019 Hall of Ceremonial Phoenixes, which became the center of political authority in China. She would die there in 1908. The serene surroundings of Zhongnanhai also became, under Cixi, a place of punishment and confinement. In 1898, following attempted reforms that displeased her, Cixi imprisoned her nephew, the Guangxu Emperor, on Yingtai Island, which juts out into the southern lake. Built as a miniature version of the mythical Penglai island, home to the immortals of Chinese legend, the tiny piece of land would become the emperor\u2019s home for most of his life, bar a brief period when the Boxer rebellion of 1900 forced the whole court to flee the capital. He would die on Yingtai Island from arsenic poisoning the day before the Empress Dowager herself. His imprisonment and death, said writer M. A. Aldrich, author of \u201cThe Search for a Vanishing Beijing: A Guide to China\u2019s Capital Through the Ages,\u201d perhaps adds a touch of poignancy for any subsequent resident of Zhongnanhai. \u201cIn addition to being a site that preserves sites of imperial splendor,\u201d he told CNN, \u201cit also functions as a reminder to the political elite about the consequences for stepping out of line.\u201d For Aldrich, however, the Zhongnanhai compound also represents the destructive impulses of the CCP towards its adopted capital in the years after 1949, when Mao Zedong proclaimed the foundation of the People\u2019s Republic. \u201cAs a political symbol of the New China, it has been torn up, rebuilt, expanded, and revamped so many times that its connection with its elegant past has been lost,\u201d Aldrich said. Architectural changes There have been serious revisions to the architecture of Zhongnanhai since the end of imperial rule in 1912. After the last emperor abdicated the throne, China\u2019s new president Yuan Shikai granted him the right to live on the northern section of the Forbidden City \u2014 and then took Zhongnanhai to be his new administration\u2019s headquarters. The changes he made to the imperial gardens were disparaged by many of the Westerners who visited them. \u201cWhatever may be one\u2019s opinion as to whether Yuan Shikai \u2018exalted his aim\u2019 in his political career, he certainly cannot be said to have done so as builder and architect,\u201d wrote L.C. Arlington and William Lewisohn in their 1935 book \u201cIn Search of Old Peking,\u201d \u201cfor all the buildings that have been erected or restored by him are in the worst possible taste.\u201d Most notable of these changes \u2014 at least to ordinary Beijingers \u2014 was the repurposing of a two-story pavilion at the very south of the gardens. Known as the Precious Moon Tower, it had been built decades earlier by the Qianlong Emperor for a homesick lover, a Muslim woman from Xinjiang, taken to Beijing as part of the spoils of war. The concubine would gaze south from the tower toward a mock mosque and bazaar the emperor had especially constructed to assuage her longing for home. Yuan refashioned this pavilion into the main entrance to his presidential compound, and established a tall watchtower just to its east. The gate was named Xinhuamen, or the Gate of New China. Today, the structure remains coated in the same deep red that graces the walls of all Beijing\u2019s imperial buildings, with a roof of glazed yellow tiles and detailing that runs below the roofline, picked out in blue and gold. The gate is now flanked by two red banners that speak to its modern purpose as China\u2019s political and party headquarters: \u201cLong Live the Great Communist Party of China\u201d reads one; and \u201cLong Live the Invincible Mao Zedong Thought\u201d on the other. On a screen wall recessed behind the entrance way, Chinese characters written in Mao\u2019s own calligraphic style declare: \u201cServe the People.\u201d Facing out onto Beijing\u2019s main east-west thoroughfare, the gate remains the most conspicuous part of Zhongnanhai. The rest of the compound has, since 1989, been firmly off-limits to the Chinese public. Seat of power Initially, after the communist victory in China\u2019s civil war in 1949, Mao Zedong took up residence at Shuangqing Villa in Fragrant Hills, another former imperial garden to the west of Beijing. Though wary of establishing himself in the imperial heart of Beijing \u2014 it is said that he refused ever to enter the Forbidden City, for fear of being associated with the power structures of old, feudal China he had fought to overthrow \u2014 Mao ultimately moved into Zhongnanhai and, in late 1949, he set up in the\u00a0Garden of Abundant Beneficence,\u00a0a large courtyard compound favored by both the Qianlong and Kangxi emperors, where he would hold court with dignitaries\u00a0and live\u00a0until 1966. Having re-established Zhongnanhai as a center of political power in the new China, Mao set about rebuilding the compound according to his tastes. \u201cSince 1949, an assortment of new architecture styles has encroached into Zhongnanhai, with a tennis court, gymnasium, swimming pools and Western buildings topped off with Chinese eave roofs adding a discordant note that would not have been appreciated by its traditionally-minded original owners,\u201d said Aldrich. In 1966, Mao moved from the Garden of Abundant Beneficence to a specially built house beside his beloved indoor swimming pool. He often summoned officials to speak to him as he bobbed in the water \u2014 and famously received Russian leader Nikita Khrushchev at his pool during a 1958 visit. \u201cTheir interpreters had to pace alongside the edge of the pool,\u201d said Jaivin. \u201cThe Russian couldn\u2019t swim and had to wear water wings. Mao loved both swimming and putting Khrushchev in his place. Finally, Khrushchev got sick of it, and clambered out to sit on the edge, dangling his feet in the water.\u201d In the residence next door, Mao lined his rooms with bookshelves housing an extensive library of Chinese classical literature. \u201cIt was here,\u201d noted Aldrich, \u201cwith the background trappings of a scholar, that he met Nixon and Kissinger in 1972.\u201d Most subsequent leaders have preferred to keep a house outside the Zhongnanhai compound. Deng Xiaoping lived, from 1977, in a courtyard house on a nearby lane adjacent to Beihai, the \u201cNorthern Sea\u201d of central Beijing\u2019s chain of lakes. While not officially disclosed, it is believed that more contemporary leaders, including Xi Jinping and his predecessors Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, have maintained homes in an exclusive gated compound in Jade Spring Hill, sometimes called the \u201cback garden\u201d of Chinese politics, out to the city\u2019s west. Aldrich noted that those leaders and party cadres who used Zhongnanhai as their primary residence often attracted unwelcome scrutiny for their activities, particularly during years of political turbulence. \u201cIn his memoirs, Chairman Mao\u2019s physician, Li Zhisui, commented that (the complex\u2019s) residents were always under surveillance,\u201d Aldrich said. \u201cDuring the Cultural Revolution, the simple act of making a fire would bring down the wrath of the security guards on the perpetrator. It was believed that such a fire was proof that incriminating or seditious materials were being destroyed.\u201d The imperial gardens offering vistas of Zhongnanhai\u2019s lakes have, today, been filled in with dozens of gray offices and meeting halls, many of which date to 1970s, when Zhongnanhai underwent significant razing and renovation \u2014 the rebuilding was so extensive that one visitor in 1979 described the grounds resembling a construction site, with muddy roads that were impossible to walk on. The contemporary compound splits roughly in two, with the northern buildings, on the banks of the \u201cmiddle lake,\u201d used as the headquarters of China\u2019s top executive body, the State Council. It is here that foreign dignitaries are admitted. Around the \u201csouthern lake,\u201d meanwhile, are the headquarters of the CCP, including, within Qinzheng Hall (the Hall of Diligent Government), the offices of the general secretary of the party (a post currently held by Xi). Many of the most historically significant political events to occur at Zhongnanhai have taken place in Huairen Hall, or the Hall of Cherished Compassion, on the western side of the Middle Lake. The hall was added to the imperial park during the late Qing dynasty, but was then extensively remodeled by the CCP in the early 1950s to impart a more august socialist grandeur. It is a broad, imposing ceremonial hall with staggered roofs of glazed green tiles falling in curved lines to upturned corners; the facade of austere grey brick is interrupted by red wooden pillars, windows and doors. The building\u2019s capacious interior houses a large auditorium, as well as numerous smaller meeting rooms. The hall has, for decades, served as the main meeting place for China\u2019s Politburo, the party\u2019s decision-making body usually comprising about two dozen members. On occasion, it has also hosted the Politburo\u2019s Standing Committee, the core of China\u2019s political elite, (the power of both bodies has notably dwindled in the era of Xi), though they most commonly meet in Qinzheng Hall, close to the general secretary\u2019s office. During the tumult of the Cultural Revolution vital discussions and debates occurred at Huairen Hall, and, in the months after its conclusion, it was there that three of the so-called Gang of Four \u2014 the political faction that included Mao\u2019s wife held responsible for the worst excesses of the era \u2014 were arrested, tricked into attending a meeting they thought was about the publication of the fifth volume of Mao\u2019s Selected Works. In April 1989, former party head Hu Yaobang suffered a heart-attack during a Politburo meeting at Huairen; his death a week later would trigger the Tiananmen Square protests that the government forcibly cracked down on in early June of that year. However, the compound hasn\u2019t always been so forbidden for the masses following the collapse of China\u2019s imperial dynasty. In the late 1920s, it became a park, with tourists allowed to boat on and swim in the lakes, while in the 1980s, the public could access some of its scenic and historical spots, including\u00a0Mao\u2019s\u00a0former residence, on\u00a0organized weekend tours.\u00a0Even early in 1989, a journalist for the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0was able to casually\u00a0drive\u00a0a senior official into the compound and drop him off inside.\u00a0During a period of warmer US and China relations in 2011, former Chinese president\u00a0Hu Jintao\u00a0invited\u00a0a group of American high school students to Zhongnanhai. Modern security concerns Today, Zhongnanhai is more closely-guarded than ever, though the inexorable development of the city has caused problems in maintaining the compound\u2019s secrecy. When an annex to the nearby Beijing Hotel was built in\u00a01973, authorities were panicked by the realization that from its upper floors one could quite easily see \u2013 and potentially target a sniper rifle \u2013 into Zhongnanhai. A building was hastily erected on the western edge of the Forbidden City to restrict this view. Likewise in 2018, when Beijing\u2019s new tallest building was\u00a0completed\u00a0\u2013 the 528-meter Citic tower, better known as the \u201cZun\u201d \u2013 the country\u2019s national security apparatus reportedly requisitioned the top floors amid fears that visitors or occupants might be able to spy into the compound. Beijing authorities did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on the security situation at the time. Zhongnanhai\u2019s entrance, Xinhuamen, has also been the site of repeated demonstrations in recent decades; in 1989, it was a gathering point for students taking part in the Tiananmen protests, whilst in 1999, more than 10,000 members of the since-banned Falun Gong gathered on the sidewalks near Zhongnanhai to protest their treatment at the hands of the government. So, while Zhongnanhai is sometimes compared to the White House, Aldrich argues that the paranoia with which the compound is today guarded makes it more like the imperial palace of centuries past: \u201cSince ordinary people are not allowed to enter Zhongnanhai, it is probably more appropriate to describe it as a \u2018New Forbidden City\u2019 for China\u2019s ruling elite rather than a place with a personal political resonance for the average citizen,\u201d he said. \u201cHeck, even the Kremlin is open to tourists!\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/style/zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/09/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_02_style_aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl", "text": "Miami has a new addition to its skyline \u2013 a 66-story residential tower built by Aston Martin, marking the British luxury sports carmaker\u2019s first foray into the residential real estate market. Comprising of 391 units, Aston Martin Residences Miami sits at the mouth of the Miami River on Biscayne Bay, the firm said in a statement Tuesday. Designed in partnership with architect Rodolfo Miani of Bodas Mian Anger and built by G&G Business Developments, the 249-meter- (818-foot-) tall building houses seven penthouses, each with private pools and terraces, as well as apartments ranging in size from one to five bedrooms. The largest unit is the \u201cUnique Triplex Penthouse,\u201d arranged over three floors at the top of the building, which remains on the market for $59 million. The property was officially opened on Tuesday. Timed to coincide with the Formula One Miami Grand Prix, the company said in a statement that it marks \u201cthe latest distinct expression of Aston Martin\u2019s ultra-luxury high performance brand.\u201d Featuring an infinity pool with a pool deck, jacuzzis and cabanas on the 55th floor, the sail-shaped complex has a two-floor fitness center, two movie theaters and a virtual golf simulator. The building has a sky bar and lounge, chef\u2019s kitchen, ballroom and private dining areas, as well as a spa, beauty salon and barber shop. Direct access to the sea via a superyacht marina is also available, plus a private butler service. Germ\u00e1n Coto, chief executive officer of G&G Business Developments, told CNN Tuesday that the firm wanted to work on a project in the \u201ccosmopolitan city\u201d of Miami, and that this piece of land was the perfect choice. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing plot with an excellent view of the river,\u201d said Coto. The structure\u2019s aerodynamic shape helps the building deal with the technical challenges presented by high winds in the area, as well as evoking the sleek shape of an Aston Martin, according to Marek Reichman, executive vice president and chief creative officer of Aston Martin. It also becomes wider from the base to the mid-section before tightening once more towards the top, making it appear to bow out over people on street level, Reichman told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the drama,\u201d he added. Challenges However, the process wasn\u2019t all plain sailing. \u201cIt was difficult to achieve what we wanted because the space and the plot is kind of small,\u201d said Coto, with the building fitting into a 1.25-acre plot of land. Meanwhile, local building regulations imposed strict standards, explained Reichman, taking into account the low-lying land and propensity for flooding. \u201cThey were some of the most amazing challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to withstand the flooding with the windows that are on street level.\u201d There were further obstacles due to the curved shape of the building, which means that units on the east side have an individual architectural structural component. Aston Martin touches Homeowners are able to customize their interior space with the help of the Aston Martin design team, with three style packages \u2013 Timeless, Covert and Indulgent \u2013 drawing on the company\u2019s British heritage, as well as the building\u2019s context. \u201cIt needs to have part of the DNA of an Aston Martin,\u201d Reichman said. \u201cBut we are in Miami, you don\u2019t have a cold November evening where you need to put the log fire on, so you\u2019ve got to be considerate of the environment that you\u2019re in.\u201d Design elements running through the building include doors with bespoke Aston Martin handles, number plinths and kestrel tan leather door tabs. Aston Martin said that 99% of the properties sold before the building was completed. Residences were sold for $1.5 million to $8.5 million, while penthouses ranged from $16 million to $59 million. The Unique Triplex Penthouse, on the market for $59 million, comes with the last remaining Aston Martin Vulcan, an 820 brake horsepower all-carbon fiber supercar, of which only 24 exist, a spokesman for the company said. Meanwhile, buyers of the 47 Signature and Penthouse units were also able to choose between an Aston Martin DBX sports SUV or the company\u2019s DB11 sportscar. Aston Martin isn\u2019t the first luxury carmaker to enter the residential property market. A 63-story building from Bentley will open in 2026 along the coastline of Sunny Isles Beach, Florida. Featuring 216 units, the property will have an elevator designed to take residents up to their doorstep while seated inside their cars.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/02/style/aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/09/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_06_middleeast_israel-hezbollah-lebanon-tensions-escalate-explainer-intl", "text": "Israel and the Lebanese Iran-backed Islamist group Hezbollah are ramping up cross-border attacks after months of low-intensity fighting, prompting the Israeli military to warn this week that it is prepared to launch a large-scale attack on its northern border. With both sides trading fire for more than eight months, experts say Israel feels it can no longer ignore its northern front or delay taking action there. A full-blown war appears to have become more likely \u2013 even if both sides have no desire for one, analysts believe. Here\u2019s what we know: Why are Israel and Hezbollah fighting? Lebanon and Israel have officially been in a state of war for decades. Israel launched a devastating invasion of Lebanon in 1982, sending tanks all the way to the capital Beirut,\u00a0after coming under attack from Palestinian militants in the country. It then occupied southern Lebanon for 22 years until it was driven out by Hezbollah in 2000. In Lebanon, Hezbollah is officially considered a \u201cresistance\u201d group tasked with confronting Israel, which Beirut classifies as an enemy state. Much of the Western world has designated Hezbollah a terrorist organization. Since then, the two sides have traded fire sporadically, but tensions boiled over in 2006 when Israel went to war in southern Lebanon after Hezbollah kidnapped two Israeli soldiers. More than 1,000 Lebanese were killed in that conflict, mostly civilians, as well as 49 Israeli civilians and 121 soldiers. Two years later, Hezbollah returned the remains of the kidnapped soldiers in exchange for the release of Lebanese and Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails, as well as the bodies of militants Israel was holding. The latest hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah started after Hamas led an attack on Israel on October 7, killing 1,200 people and abducting 250, according to Israeli authorities. That prompted Israel to go to war with Hamas in Gaza, during which it has levelled much of the territory and killed more than 36,000 Palestinians. Hezbollah has said that its current round of fighting with Israel is to support the Palestinians in Gaza. The military capability of the Lebanese group has grown since 2006, when it relied largely on inaccurate Soviet-era Katyusha rockets. Today, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah says his group boasts more than 100,000 fighters and reservists. The group is also believed to possess 150,000 rockets that could overwhelm Israel\u2019s defenses if an all-out war breaks out. Why are tensions flaring up now? The conflict between Israel and Hezbollah has been gradually intensifying since October 8, said Heiko Wimmen, project director for Iraq, Syria and Lebanon at the International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based think tank. It\u2019s a \u201cslow-motion escalation\u201d that \u201cinches upwards,\u201d he said. But both sides have come closer to war of late as clashes across the border have grown in number and scale. \u201cThere is clearly an escalation,\u201d said Wimmen, particularly in terms of deaths on each side of the border and the type of weaponry Hezbollah has been deploying. An Israeli reservist was killed in a Hezbollah strike on a village in northern Israel on Wednesday, bringing the total number of soldiers killed on the Israeli side to 19. Israel and Hezbollah have also been striking much deeper into each other\u2019s territory than they were at the beginning of the war, when fighting was confined to a roughly 4-kilometer (2.5-mile) radius of the border on either side. Hezbollah has fired 35 kilometers into Israel, while Israel has targeted areas of Lebanon more than 120 kilometers north. Cross-border attacks from Lebanon this week led to large fires blazing through Israel\u2019s northern region,\u00a0which Israel attributed to rocket fire from southern Lebanon, where Hezbollah said it had launched a \u201cswarm of drones\u201d at Israeli military sites. On Wednesday Hezbollah said it had targeted Israel\u2019s Iron Dome defense system in the northern village of Ramot Naftali, using a guided missile. Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Lt. Col. Peter Lerner told a briefing Thursday: \u201cI can\u2019t confirm that at this stage. I can\u2019t confirm that this happened at all.\u201d Amal Saad, a lecturer at Cardiff University and an expert on Hezbollah, said the group\u2019s escalation \u201cis a marked departure from prior flare-ups that have occurred since October 8.\u201d \u201cThis stage transcends merely responding to Israeli attacks and restoring deterrence; it involves conveying new messages and strategies,\u201d Saad wrote on X. The conflict has become \u201cvery visible\u201d and \u201cdifficult to ignore,\u201d said Wimmen, of the International Crisis Group, adding that Israeli officials feel compelled to respond, or at least be seen as responding, amid pressure to react from far-right ministers in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government. There is a push within government and the Israeli army to take action in the north, Ronni Shaked, a scholar at the Truman Institute at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, told CNN. \u201cNobody can live in this situation.\u201d What are both sides saying? Rhetoric has been fiery from both sides, but experts say neither side wants a full-blown conflict. Netanyahu in December warned that Beirut would turn into Gaza if Hezbollah chose to start an all-out war. But Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich this week poured cold water on the prospect of a wider war, saying the IDF isn\u2019t interested in broadening the war to eliminate Hezbollah. The military is \u201ctelling us right now that it doesn\u2019t want to\u2026 launch an attack in the north, fight and defeat Hezbollah, and overwhelm it and create a security zone.\u201d During his visit to the northern city of Kiryat Shmona near the Lebanese border on Wednesday, Netanyahu said Israel was prepared for \u201cvery intense action\u201d in the north. \u201cWhoever thinks that they can hurt us and that we will sit idly by is making a big mistake,\u201d the prime minister said. \u201cOne way or another, we will restore security to the north.\u201d Naim Qassem, Hezbollah\u2019s second-in-command, told Al Jazeera on Tuesday that the group had assessed that recent threats from Israel were not serious. \u201cEither way, we have decided not to widen the battle and we do not want an all-out war. But if it is imposed on us, we are ready and we won\u2019t retreat,\u201d Qassem said, adding that Hezbollah will end its attacks on Israel once the war in Gaza stops. Is a full-blown war likely? Experts say that while both sides may not choose to start an all-out war, their escalatory actions may still trigger one inadvertently. Wimmen of the International Crisis Group said that Israel and Hezbollah are unlikely to take a conscious decision to start a war. However, the more intense the conflict becomes, the deeper each side strikes into the other\u2019s territory and the heavier the weapons used, the more likely it is that \u201csomething goes wrong,\u201d he said. Netanyahu is under intense pressure from the opposition and members of his coalition to take action in the north, especially given that so many Israelis have been displaced from the area. More than 53,000 Israelis have been forced to leave their homes in the north, the IDF said. In Lebanon, more than 94,000 people have been displaced from areas and towns near the border with Israel since the conflict started, according to figures released Tuesday by the Lebanese Ministry of Public Health. \u201cAll Hezbollah strongholds must be burned and destroyed. War!\u201d said Israeli far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir in a statement this week. Opposition leader Yair Lapid also slammed the government, saying: \u201cThe north goes up in flames and Israeli deterrence burns with it. \u201cThe government has no plan for the day after in Gaza, no plan to return the residents to the north, no management, no strategy. A government of total abandonment,\u201d Lapid said on X. The US has cautioned against escalation, worried it might spin out of control. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Wednesday the United States is \u201cincredibly concerned\u201d about the risk of escalation, adding that the Biden administration is engaged in diplomatic conversations \u201cto try to avoid that conflict from escalating beyond control.\u201d Shaked, the Truman Institute scholar, said that despite Hezbollah\u2019s assertions that its attacks on Israel are in support of Gaza, the group\u2019s strategy is likely to be closely coordinated with its closest ally Iran \u2013 especially with so much at stake.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-lebanon-tensions-escalate-explainer-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/09/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_06_europe_russia-detains-french-citizen-intl-latam", "text": "French President Emmanuel Macron confirmed on Thursday that a French national has been detained in Moscow,\u00a0but denied\u00a0that\u00a0the man was working for the French government. \u201cIn no way was he working for France. Now we are very vigilant, he will receive all the consular protections that apply in such a case. I want to say the truth in the face of the brainwashing that we hear,\u201d Macron said. Russia\u2019s Investigative Committee said earlier on Thursday that a French citizen, employed by the non-profit Swiss Center for Humanitarian Dialogue, was detained on suspicion of \u201ccollecting information in the field of military activities of the Russian Federation.\u201d Video released by the Investigative Committee showed the man being arrested by security personnel\u00a0at\u00a0a cafe in Moscow and escorted\u00a0into a military van. The Investigative Committee alleges the French national had\u00a0been gathering information on Russia\u2019s \u201cmilitary and military-technical activities\u201d for several years and didn\u2019t register as a foreign agent. \u201cFor these purposes, he repeatedly visited the territory of Russia, including the city of Moscow, where he held meetings with citizens of the Russian Federation,\u201d the Investigative Committee said. An Investigative Committee official told Russian state news agency TASS that the man worked as a consultant at the non-profit handling Eurasian issues after the February 2014 events in Ukraine, including the mass pro-democracy protests that swept Kyiv and the exit of the pro-Russian, former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich. CNN has reached out to the French Foreign Ministry and the Swiss Center for Humanitarian Dialogue for comment. Relations between both countries became strained when Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine more than two years ago. Several Westerners have found themselves detained in the country amid the rising tensions. US-Russian journalist Alsu\u00a0Kurmasheva was detained last year in the Russian city of Kazan while waiting for a return flight to the Czech Republic, where she was based. She had arrived in Russia in May due to an urgent family matter, according to her employer the US-funded Radio Free Europe/ Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), and was accused of refusing to register as a foreign agent. Russia expanded its law on \u201cforeign agents\u201d in 2022, signaling an intensifying crackdown on free speech and opposition under Putin. Since then, not only individuals or organizations receiving funding from abroad are regarded as foreign agents but also anyone who has \u201creceived support and (or) is under foreign influence.\u201d Wall Street Journal reporter\u00a0Evan Gershkovich\u00a0was arrested on a work trip in 2023 and charged with espionage \u2014 accusations he and his employer vehemently deny.

{"id": "2024_06_03_europe_ukraine-soldiers-germany-prosthetic-limbs-intl-cmd", "text": "Pavlo Kushnirov was among the Ukrainian soldiers fighting in the eastern city of Bakhmut with the 114th\u00a0territorial defense brigade on a sunny day last winter when Russian shelling\u00a0changed his life forever. \u201cFor two days our unit was under heavy bombardment from Russian artillery and drones. That morning \u2013 on 5 December \u2013 the shells found me,\u201d the 43-year-old bearded soldier, who now uses a wheelchair, told CNN in Berlin, as he pointed\u00a0to where his legs should be. Instead, there are two stumps: One of his legs is amputated just below the knee joint, the other is amputated above the knee. Fellow Ukrainian soldier Vitaliy Sayko-Kazakov, 42, served in the 19th Separate Rifle Battalion in Chervonopopivka, on the front line where Ukraine\u2019s Luhansk and Donetsk regions meet. His left leg was torn off during a battle with Russian forces on July 1 last year. \u201cI immediately put a tourniquet on myself and luckily remained conscious. On adrenaline, I guess, I saved myself,\u201d he said. His right leg sustained serious injuries with an open fracture and eventually had to be amputated in Lviv, he told CNN earlier this month in Berlin. For three months he was confined to his hospital bed. Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine has killed tens of thousands and left even more with lost limbs and other life-altering injuries since the full-scale invasion began in February 2022. German officials estimate there are between 30,000 and 50,000 Ukrainian amputees as a result of the conflict. Obtaining adequate prosthetic limbs and care is tough inside Ukraine. Now a German non-governmental organization is working to bring wounded Ukrainian soldiers to Berlin so they can be fitted with custom-made artificial limbs and given treatment that will allow them to lead as normal a life as possible. Kushnirov and Sayko-Kazakov are among the first of 60 severely wounded Ukrainian soldiers who will receive treatment in Germany, thanks to the Berlin-based NGO \u201cLife Bridge Ukraine.\u201d They hope to start what they see as a new life soon. \u201cMy doctor called and said there was an opportunity to go abroad for me to receive prosthetics. So, I said OK,\u201d Vitaliy said. \u201cOnce there were hundreds of us, now there are thousands of people like me.\u201d Limbs amputated quickly to save lives Marko G\u00e4nsl, from German health care company Seeger,\u00a0is among five orthopedic technicians in Berlin who build custom-made prostheses for the soldiers. When CNN visited the wounded soldiers in their accommodation center for the first time, G\u00e4nsl was assessing the new patients. Bending over Kushnirov\u2019s leg stumps, he softly felt along them. \u201cAre you in pain?\u201d he asked.\u00a0Kushnirov shook his head as a translator relayed the question. \u201cLet me know if anything hurts,\u201d G\u00e4nsl said, taking out a tape to measure the stumps. He and other orthopedic technicians assessed the condition of Kushnirov\u2019s limbs. Battlefield conditions in Ukraine mean limbs must often be amputated quickly to save soldiers\u2019 lives. \u201cThe severity of the amputations often leave the survivors with stumps that won\u2019t allow for the fitting of regular-sized prosthetics,\u201d said G\u00e4nsl. \u201cAnd of course we are dealing here with completely different requirements (than what orthopedic technicians are used to in Germany).\u201d It will be relatively easy to provide a prosthesis for Kushnirov\u2019s right leg, G\u00e4nsl\u00a0said. However, his left leg will be more difficult to treat because it was amputated above the knee. G\u00e4nsl moved on to inspect the next patient: 27-year-old Valerii Omelchenko, who was drafted into the war three months after Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. \u201cI was on duty defending my country on November 23 last year when a Russian drone flew over me and a grenade exploded right in front of me,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cI jumped away and pulled my legs into my chest to protect myself from the explosion which I knew was coming. But look at my legs, they are injured badly.\u201d Sitting in a wheelchair with his left leg amputated and the other one badly bruised and shattered, Omelchenko added: \u201cBut at least I am still alive.\u201d Keen to save his damaged leg, doctors in Germany kept it in a metal frame, or external fixator, at first while it healed. That has just been removed and he will be fitted with a prosthesis on the other leg soon. A bridge between two capitals Janine von Wolfersdorff, a Berlin-based financial expert who became involved in humanitarian aid work in Ukraine after Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion, is the initiator of Life Bridge Ukraine, a project\u00a0which is being run in partnership between the German and Ukrainian capitals. Under its auspices, experts in workshops in Berlin will make new limbs and teach the 60 patients chosen for treatment how to walk and move again. Von Wolfersdorff traveled\u00a0to Ukraine herself with a medical team to assess some of the most seriously injured soldiers. \u201cIt\u2019s a challenge to find the right patients in Ukraine. There are so many complex cases. At the same time, there are too few orthopedic technicians in Ukraine to provide all war victims with fast, adequate and good care,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cWe want to give Ukrainian war-wounded soldiers a new life\u00a0\u2013\u00a0and simultaneously want to train six Ukrainians for three months here in Berlin, who will learn to build very good quality prosthetics so that they can do it themselves in Kyiv.\u201d Von Wolfersdorff is collaborating closely with Kyiv\u2019s Mayor Vitali Klitschko and Berlin\u2019s Governing Mayor Kai Wegner on the project, hoping that a prosthetics center will be opened in Kyiv later this year. Ultimately,\u00a0her group wants to open further prosthetics centres in other Ukrainian cities as well. \u201cThe trainees learn here first-hand when a stump may need another amputation, another surgery, when a scar needs to be attended to again, and other issues that arise during this very complex process,\u201d Von Wolfersdorff\u00a0said. CNN met with Ukrainian trainee Volodymyr Havrylov in the Seeger workshop. \u201cIt takes time to train to do it correctly and get every detail right,\u201d he said. In the past few weeks, he has learnt that \u201csurgeons need to make a good stump. The better the stump is, the easier for us to make a stump receiver.\u201d Each patient requires a different treatment, Havrylov said, explaining that \u201csometimes the limb is too short, sometimes it is long\u00a0\u2013\u00a0sometimes there is not enough space for the fitting. Sometimes patients still have pain somewhere.\u201d Oftentimes there are other medical conditions that could influence the fitting of prosthetic limbs. Havrylov said he wants to learn \u201cas much as possible from the Germans and maybe even get better at it so that we can open our center in Kyiv and help there. Unfortunately, there will be more people with injuries. We need good workshops to provide our Ukrainians with a good life. We need to bring them back into society.\u201d Life Bridge Ukraine has collected around $600,000 in donations for the project, including for the care of the soldiers in Berlin. \u201cIt is a long process of recuperation,\u201d Von Wolfersdorff said. \u201cWe seek a holistic treatment approach:\u00a0In addition to a lot of physiotherapy, patients are offered psychological help, as well as nutritional advice, to reintegrate themselves into as\u00a0normal as possible\u00a0a\u00a0life.\u201d \u2018Completely new way of learning to walk\u2019 A few weeks later, CNN joined Kushnirov and Sayko-Kazakov for their first fittings in Seeger\u2019s Berlin workshop. Vitaliy looked at his new artificial limbs and smiled. \u201cThese are my two legs,\u201d he said, pointing at his new prosthetic limbs. \u201cOne and two. We are going to fit them today.\u201d With the help of the medical and orthopedic technician teams Sayko-Kazakov took his first steps\u00a0using them.\u00a0\u201cThese are cool feet. Really fine work.\u201d For Kushnirov, the initial fitting was trickier because of the artificial knee joint on one limb. \u201cUnfortunately walking will be more difficult for him,\u201d G\u00e4nsl explained. \u201cIt is a completely new way of learning how to walk.\u201d Kushnirov knows his rehabilitation process will take time, but he is determined to keep trying. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame I am losing so much time getting rehabilitated and I know it will still take me a lot of time. But of course, my life will improve,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s hard to say what life will be like after my prosthetics fittings. I know it will be different.\u201d Sayko-Kazakov, Kushnirov and the other soldiers with new artificial limbs will receive a lot of training on how to move again in the coming weeks in Berlin. Any final adjustments that are needed will be made before they receive their permanent prosthetic fittings and leave to be cared for back home in Ukraine. \u201cIt is a lot of fun working together with our highly motivated patients and Ukrainian trainees, we see so much progress,\u201d G\u00e4nsl said. However, there will be challenges ahead for these soldiers even with their final artificial limbs. \u201cProsthetic fittings need to be adjusted again and again. It is a lifelong process,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter all, bodies change. Just as we occasionally put on weight over Christmas or lose weight when exercising, a stump does not grow with you.\u201d Both Sayko-Kazakov and Kushnirov are determined to return to Ukraine soon, walking comfortably with their new artificial limbs. They say they\ufeff are ready to support their units back home as they fight to fend off Russian forces. \u201cThe war is not yet over. Our work is not yet finished,\u201d Sayko-Kazakov said. \u201cI\u00a0often think of the guys who worked with me at the front line. So many lost their lives. So many I carried out on my shoulders. It hurts. When we go back, we can be useful on the home front, for example assembling drones.\u201d Kushnirov acknowledges his limitations\ufeff. \u201cI know I won\u2019t be able to walk again just like others do. I won\u2019t be able to fight at the front line anymore,\u201d he said, \u201cbut there are a lot of other things I can do: I could operate a drone or take care of repair and maintenance works. Wherever I can help, I will do so. I will continue to fight for Ukraine.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/europe/ukraine-soldiers-germany-prosthetic-limbs-intl-cmd/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/09/2024", "section": "world"}}

The win \u2013 \u015awi\u0105tek\u2019s fifth grand slam crown and fourth at Roland Garros \u2013 underlines the Polish superstar\u2019s dominance on clay, extending her winning run at the tournament to 21 matches. She is the first woman since Justine Henin in 2007 to win three consecutive French Open titles, dismantling first-time grand slam finalist Paolini in just an hour and eight minutes. The 12th seed came into the final as a heavy underdog against \u015awi\u0105tek but took a surprise lead at the start of the first set when she broke her decorated opponent\u2019s serve. \u015awi\u0105tek\u2019s response, however, was swift and brutal. She won the next 10 games in a row to put the match well beyond Paolini\u2019s reach, and when the 28-year-old finally got back on the board, it was all too late. At 5-1 in the second set, \u015awi\u0105tek only had to hold her serve to win, which she did when Paolini lofted a backhand return long. Another title secured, \u015awi\u0105tek sunk to her knees in delight before climbing into the stands to embrace her team. In the later stages of this year\u2019s French Open, \u015awi\u0105tek has been unmatched, dropping just 17 games across the past five matches. But for all her superiority, she was almost ousted from the tournament by Naomi Osaka in the second round. The former world No. 1 had a match point, which \u015awi\u0105tek saved and then rallied to win the match. That has been her only blip in an otherwise phenomenal tournament. The 23-year-old has now won 19 matches in a row, collecting titles in Madrid, Rome and now Paris. In the final, she hit 18 winners, wrapped up three game to love, and faced only one break point. \u201cI love this place, I wait every year to come back here,\u201d \u015awi\u0105tek said in her on-court interview. \u201cI was almost out of the tournament in the second round so thank you for staying with me, it\u2019s been a really emotional tournament. To everyone at home, my sister, my family, my sponsors \u2013 thank you for the constant support.\u201d Paolini, meanwhile, was comprehensively outhit by \u015awi\u0105tek on Court Philippe-Chatrier However, she will soon be a top 10 player for the first time in her career after an impressive run in Paris, having two weeks ago never progressed past the second round of the French Open, nor the fourth round of a grand slam. \u201cCongratulations to everyone who made this tournament possible,\u201d Paolini said in her on-court interview. \u201c(It has been) the best days of my life, it\u2019s still going because tomorrow I have the doubles final \u2026 It\u2019s been a very intense 15 days and I\u2019m really happy and proud of myself and my team to be here. Today was tough but I\u2019m really proud of myself anyway.\u201d Beaten only twice at the French Open, \u015awi\u0105tek follows Monica Seles and Henin by claiming a third consecutive women\u2019s singles titles at Roland Garros in the Open Era. It\u2019s also the first time that a women\u2019s player has completed a three-peat at the same major tournament since Serena Williams at the US Open 10 years ago. Just two women \u2013 Chris Evert (seven) and Steffi Graf (six) \u2013 have won more French Open titles than \u015awi\u0105tek, and she will surely keep adding to her legacy with a long career still ahead of her. Even prior to the final, \u015awi\u0105tek was asked about comparisons to Rafael Nadal, who has won a record 14 singles titles at Roland Garros. \u201cWe\u2019ll see in 14 years if the journey is similar,\u201d she said, before \u2013 in her usual self-deprecating style \u2013 explaining that she was \u201cproud\u201d to be mentioned in the same sentence as the Spaniard.

{"id": "2024_06_07_middleeast_un-israel-global-list-children-intl-latam", "text": "United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has added Israel\u2019s military to a global list of offenders that have committed violations against children, his spokesman confirmed on Friday. Israel had been told it is being placed on the list in the secretary-general\u2019s annual report on children in armed conflict, to be sent to the UN Security Council next Friday, Stephane Dujarric told a press briefing. Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad were also added to the list, according to a diplomatic source, along with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). Dujarric added that the Israeli UN mission was called by Guterres\u2019 chief of staff on Friday, a courtesy afforded to countries that are newly listed. \u201cIt is done to give those countries a heads-up and avoid leaks,\u201d he said. Israeli Ambassador to the UN Gilad Erdan recorded a video of himself making a phone call from his office, apparently to a UN official, and leaked part of it on social media. In the video, Erdan expressed outrage at the UN decision, calling the IDF \u201cthe most moral army in the world.\u201d \u201cThe only one who is blacklisted today is the secretary-general, whose decisions since the war started, and even before, are rewarding terrorists and incentivizing them to use children for terror acts\u2026 Shame on him!\u201d Dujarric said it was \u201cshocking and unacceptable\u201d that Erdan had apparently published the private call, saying it was \u201csomething he had never seen in my 24 years serving this organization.\u201d Israel\u2019s inclusion on the list comes after eight months of war in Gaza, in which more than 15,500 children have been killed, according to the Ministry of Health in the enclave. The war was sparked by a Hamas-led assault on Israel on October 7, which killed 1,200 people and saw some 250 others taken hostage. Many are still in captivity and Hamas\u2019 top leadership is still at large despite the Israeli onslaught. The UN\u2019s so-called blacklist has previously included countries such as Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian envoy to the UN, said the decision to add Israel to the list \u201cwill not bring back tens of thousands of our children who were killed by Israel over decades and will not restore normal life for the children who were permanently disabled by its actions.\u201d \u201cBut it is an important step in the right direction towards ending the double standards and the culture of impunity Israel has enjoyed for far too long and that left our children vulnerable to its consequences.\u201d The annual report will go to the Security Council on June 14. The official report will be published on June 18. It will be discussed at a debate in the council on June 26. Asked about ramifications, the UN spokesman said it will be up to the members to decide any action. The war has seen Israel-UN relations reach historic lows with Israeli diplomats using their platforms at the UN to denounce the world body. Israel\u2019s quarrel with the UN has gone beyond the secretary-general. Israeli officials have also criticized the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), the World Health Organization, UN Women, and the UN\u2019s Special Rapporteur for the Occupied Palestinian Territories Francesca Albanese. Meanwhile,\u00a0dozens of UN staffers\u00a0have been killed in Gaza since the conflict began, the largest loss in the world body\u2019s history. Israel has long accused UNRWA of anti-Israeli incitement, which UNRWA has repeatedly denied, and\u00a0in 2017, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sought\u00a0to dismantle the UN body, saying it should be merged with the main UN refugee agency. Since the October 7 attack, Israeli journalists and news outlets have refocused their attention on UNRWA and have\u00a0amplified stories\u00a0questioning its role in the war.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/middleeast/un-israel-global-list-children-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/09/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_03_uk_nigel-farage-reform-conservative-britain-uk-intl-gbr", "text": "Nigel Farage, the \u201carchitect\u201d of Brexit and a perennially disruptive force in British politics, has announced his intention to stand as a candidate for the hard-right Reform UK party in the country\u2019s July 4 general election. In an \u201cemergency\u201d press conference Monday, Farage announced he would contest the seat in Clacton, a deprived town on England\u2019s southeastern coast, where Reform has polled well \u2013 and that he would take over as leader of the party. Despite failing to be elected as a Member of Parliament on seven previous occasions, Farage\u2019s candidacy could inject new energy into the Reform campaign and provide another headache for the embattled Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, whose governing Conservative Party has long feared losing voters to the right. Just last month, Farage had said he would not stand in the general election, and that he would instead \u201chelp with the grassroots campaign\u201d to reelect former US President Donald Trump, who was later found guilty by a Manhattan jury of all 34 charges of falsifying business records. But, speaking from London, Farage said he had begun to change his mind over the weekend. When asked by voters why he was not standing for election, Farage said he gave his \u201clogical, rational reasons for it.\u201d \u201cBut I couldn\u2019t help, after each exchange, I simply couldn\u2019t help feeling that somehow, they felt I was letting them down,\u201d he said. \u201cI have decided. I\u2019ve changed my mind. It\u2019s allowed, you know. It\u2019s not always a sign of weakness.\u201d Farage has been a disruptive figure in British politics for three decades, transforming the Eurosceptic movement from the fantasy of fringe politicians into the country\u2019s eventual vote to leave the European Union in 2016. He joined the nascent Reform UK party in 2018, which has since climbed to around 10% in most national polls, bolstered by its opposition to immigration and the government\u2019s net zero plans. Due to the country\u2019s first-past-the-post electoral system, smaller parties often struggle to translate their national support into parliamentary seats. The problem plagued Farage\u2019s earlier UK Independence Party (UKIP) which, despite securing 12.6% of the vote in the 2015 general election, secured only one seat. Speaking Monday, Farage said Reform intended to win \u201cmillions\u201d more votes than UKIP had during that election, in a bid to make it the UK\u2019s official opposition. \u201cHow many seats in Parliament can we win under this system? That\u2019s another matter,\u201d he said. Threat to Conservatives Farage\u2019s candidacy may do more harm to the Conservatives than it does good for Reform. The Conservatives have tried to appeal to more right-wing voters by promising to crack down on immigration, most eye-catchingly by attempting to send asylum seekers to Rwanda. But, after two years of attempting to implement the policy, Reform have accused the Conservatives of failing to turn their tough rhetoric into results, as net migration figures have continued to climb. The Conservatives \u2013 who trail the opposition Labour Party by more than 20 points in most polls \u2013 now face the prospect of hemorrhaging more votes to Reform. While that might not be enough to win Reform more than a few seats, it could contribute to the Conservatives losing dozens more seats to Labour. Sunak will now face another knotty dilemma, as he tries to hold the Conservatives\u2019 broad but fractious coalition together: does he plow more resources into targeting Reform voters, or does he focus on retaining the support of more moderate Tories. The Conservatives\u2019 Farage problem will not fade soon. As well as becoming leader, Farage announced he is \u201ccoming back for the next five years.\u201d \u201cWe already know that the Conservative Party will be in opposition. But it won\u2019t be the opposition,\u201d he said, raising the spectre that the Conservatives could slide from 14 years in power to a third-place finish in July\u2019s election. The weaker the Conservative Party is after the election, the more heat Farage can put on them. In opposition, the Conservatives will have to find a new leader and a new direction for the party. There will be internal rows over whether they shift back to the center or follow Farage to the right. There are as many in the Conservative Party who find Farage appalling as there are who\u2019d like to see him join the party. Whichever wing of the Conservative party wins that internal debate risks seeing the other wing leave the party \u2013 and in the case of those on the right of the party, possibly off to join Reform. What is clear is that Farage still has a unique ability to dominate the political agenda during an election campaign with a single public statement. And it will no doubt be one of the top topics when Sunak and Starmer meet for their first televised debate on Tuesday.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/uk/nigel-farage-reform-conservative-britain-uk-intl-gbr/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/09/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_africa_jacob-zuma-comeback-south-africa-elections-intl", "text": "South Africa\u2019s African National Congress (ANC) party faces a mammoth challenge as it needs to form a government with its political rivals after suffering a seismic blow in last week\u2019s election. On Wednesday, the ANC\u2019s national spokesperson insisted that any coalition government would be in the interests of unity and stability and hinted at a government of national unity of some kind. \u201cThe ANC has taken the position that we must all act in the interest of our country and its people, and work on a national consensus on the form of government that is best suited to move South Africa forward at this moment in our history,\u201d Mahlengi Bhengu-Motsiri told a press briefing. Still, some of the same parties that sought the ANC\u2019s demise will now have to play a part in governing South Africa. For decades, the ANC could rule alone, but support for the the party plummeted to around 40% in last Wednesday\u2019s elections, down from 57% in 2019. Analysts and opinion polls had forecast losses for the ANC but a pivotal factor in the party\u2019s staggering decline was former President Jacob Zuma and his newly formed uMkhonto weSizwe (MK) party, which capitalized on widespread discontent within the ANC\u2019s traditional voter base. Zuma\u2019s revenge Zuma \u2013 a fierce critic of current ANC leader and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa \u2013 was forced to resign as president in 2018 and has been looking for political revenge ever since. His MK party, named after the ANC\u2019s former armed wing, appears to have achieved just that \u2013 formed just five months ago, it is now the third-largest party in South Africa, receiving almost 15% of the vote. Zuma positioned MK as \u201ca party that is meant to restore the ANC to its former glory,\u201d said political analyst Tessa Dooms, programmes director at the Rivonia Circle non-profit organization/political think tank in Johannesburg. She says many MK voters saw this ballot as a protest vote. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen with the MK party is the use of a vote to send a signal to the ANC of the level of unhappiness, not only of the country itself but within its ranks who\u2019ve supported it over the last 30 years,\u201d Dooms told CNN. Despite Zuma being barred from running for parliament by the Constitutional Court because of a previous contempt of court violation, the 82-year-old\u2019s\u00a0face remained on the ballot paper. Zuma is no stranger to controversy or the courtroom. He\u202fhas faced\u202fhundreds of corruption, fraud and racketeering charges\u202fover the years. He has always denied all of them and became known as the \u201cTeflon President\u201d because few politicians could have survived the scandals he weathered. Ramaphosa replaced him as president when Zuma was finally forced to resign. Later revelations of \u201cstate capture\u201d \u2013 or rampant corruption riveted the nation in an anti-corruption commission. Much of the focus was on Zuma\u2019s relationship with the influential and wealthy Gupta brothers. With the ANC\u2019s popularity now at an all-time low and as Ramaphosa\u2019s political future hangs in the balance, Zuma could have the last laugh. But it is too early to tell. Due to the poor election showing, South Africa\u2019s political landscape has been fundamentally altered, leaving the ANC with the daunting task of forming a coalition government. In many countries, coalition talks can take months, but South Africa\u2019s constitution gives rival parties a short window to do something they have never really done before: come together. According to the constitution, rival parties have a mere 14 days to create a coalition after the final election results are announced. The outcome of these talks will likely\u00a0determine Ramaphosa\u2019s future as president. Ramaphosa\u2019s\u00a0allies\u00a0in the party are digging in. On Sunday, ANC Secretary-General Fikile Mbalula warned potential coalition partners that the president\u2019s resignation is \u201cnot going to happen.\u201d \u201cI think the ANC has many factors to consider in terms of how it forms a government \u2013 both the stability of the country at large but also for the sake of having a government that still holds to the values of the ANC that it has long said that it serves,\u201d Dooms told CNN. The potential coalition partners present starkly different political ideologies and policy priorities. A marriage of convenience First, there is the official opposition Democratic Alliance (DA), a broadly centrist and pro-business party that has heavily criticized the ANC for many years. Led by John Steenhuisen, it is seen by many\u00a0as a party for White South Africans, something the DA rejects. Steenhuisen has not ruled out going into a coalition with the ANC. A DA-ANC alliance, however it would form, would likely keep Ramaphosa in his job, say analysts. \u201cThe only way Ramaphosa stays is through a DA-ANC coalition.\u00a0Outside that,\u00a0the other parties, MK and EFF\u00a0(Economic Freedom Fighters), have made it clear the first point of negotiation is he must go,\u201d said TK Pooe, a senior lecturer at Wits School of Governance. If the ANC were to pair with the DA, which\u202freceived 21.8% of the vote, their combined support would amount to more than 60%, an outright majority. However, this relationship would require both parties to make some major compromises. While in government, the ANC\u2019s flagship policy for driving economic inclusion and racial equality in post-apartheid South Africa has been its Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment policy, known as triple-BEE or simply BEE. The\u202fBEE policy has been criticized\u202fby some as neither broad-based, nor empowering. In contrast, the DA has\u202fsaid\u202fit would replace BEE with an \u201cEconomic Justice Policy\u201d that \u201ctargets the poor black majority for redress, rather than a small, connected elite.\u201d The DA is also against the ANC\u2019s flagship National Health Insurance Act (NIH) in its current form. The act, which was signed into law two weeks before the election, seeks to provide universal health care for all and gradually limit the role of private health insurers. However, both parties believe in the primacy of South Africa\u2019s constitution and both have promised to crack down on corruption. Awkwardly, the DA is currently\u202fpressing corruption charges\u202fagainst the ANC\u2019s deputy president,\u00a0Paul Mashatile. In a move to appease internal critics, the ANC-DA coalition could be expanded to include smaller parties, or the ANC could form a minority government with a \u201cconfidence-and-supply\u201d agreement with opposition partners like the DA and the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), where they remain outside of government but support it on key votes in exchange for policy concessions. A bitter pill to swallow? If the ANC decides\u00a0to pursue coalition talks with MK, then Zuma will want Ramaphosa out, solidifying his revenge. However, if South Africa\u2019s president maintains his grip on the ANC, a coalition with MK is unlikely. The MK party\u2019s manifesto also\u00a0demands an overhaul of the country\u2019s constitution to restore more powers to traditional leaders. Zuma \u201cunapologetically focused his campaign around Zulu nationalism and that was a constituency that was easy for him to target,\u201d\u202fpolitical\u00a0analyst and former ANC\u00a0lawmaker\u00a0Melanie Verwoerd told CNN. By appealing to his Zulu base, Zuma\u2019s party has also stirred ethnic and tribal tensions, a strategy that, while electorally effective, risks deepening divisions in South Africa, Verwoerd added. The ANC\u2019s policies, grounded in the principles of non-racial and non-tribal governance, are at odds with this approach. It is also currently unclear how much MK actually wants to govern. Despite doing well at the polls, the party has demanded a re-run, threatened court action, and suggested boycotting the first sitting of Parliament. However,\u00a0it has provided no evidence of\u00a0voting\u00a0irregularities. The other option for a coalition is the EFF,\u00a0led by former ANC youth leader Julius Malema, who was expelled from the party more than a decade ago. The breakaway party espouses land expropriation without compensation and sweeping state nationalism, including nationalizing the Reserve Bank. Malema has said\u202fhe would give the EFF vote to the ANC on the condition that his deputy, Floyd Shivambu, becomes Minister of Finance in an effort to control fiscal policy. South Africa\u2019s business community and middle class are broadly nervous about an EFF\u2013ANC coalition and its effect on investor confidence. The DA calls it part of a\u00a0\u201cdoomsday\u201d option because of the potential impact on investment and trade. The EFF won just under 10% of the vote, so any coalition with the ANC would need to include at least another party in the mix to give it a healthy majority. The IFP, with almost 4% of the vote, could be such a kingmaker. Aside from a classic coalition deal or a \u201cconfidence and supply\u201d agreement, another hypothetical option on the table would be a \u201cgovernment of national unity\u201d (GNU), bringing in all the major parties. This scenario would hark back to the post-apartheid era when South Africa operated under a GNU to oversee the new constitution,\u00a0led by Mandela as president and FW de Klerk and Thabo Mbeki as deputy presidents,\u00a0between April 1994 and February 1997.

They are trapped, along with his wife and mother, in a sea of displaced families with little respite from overcrowding and pollution. The Palestinian father told CNN he struggles to find aid. Instead, he and his family have no choice but to drink contaminated water and eat just one meal per day. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about food because there is none,\u201d he said in a written message on June 5. \u201cWe survived the death from rockets and shelling; will we die of famine? After eight months of Israel\u2019s bombardment in Gaza \u2014 following the October 7 attacks led by the militant group Hamas that killed around 1,200 people and captured 250 hostages in southern Israel \u2014 human rights groups have described \u201cunspeakable\u201d living conditions for Palestinians in the enclave, with over 75% of the population displaced, according to the UN\u2019s agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA). Israel\u2019s military campaign has pulverized neighborhoods, damaged health infrastructure and depleted food, water and fuel supplies. The Israeli offensive has killed at least 36,654 Palestinians and injured another 83,309 people, according to Gaza\u2019s Ministry of Health. CNN cannot independently confirm these figures. While Israeli officials have insisted there is no limit on the amount of aid that can enter Gaza, the UN has accused authorities of imposing \u201cunlawful restrictions\u201d on relief operations such as blocked land routes, communications blackouts and air strikes. Local staffers told CNN they are forced to turn away the needy at distribution points because there is not enough relief to hand out. Here is a breakdown of how the aid crisis has deepened in the territory after 245 days of war. Crossing closures nearly halt all aid Israel\u2019s restrictions on land routes into Gaza\u00a0meant aid was barely trickling into the strip. But the crisis became even more dire early last month, after Israeli forces launched an assault in the southern city of Rafah and seized control of the Palestinian side of the land crossing into Egypt. The UN\u2019s food agency said ongoing attacks have blocked access to its main warehouse in Rafah since May 9, forcing them to suspend distributions there for nearly a month now. The agency expressed concerns for Palestinians in the south as the closure of the key Rafah crossing has severely limited food supplies reaching the area, recalling the dire food insecurity in northern Gaza after previous closures. Similarly, US-based non-profit World Central Kitchen paused operations at its main facility\u00a0in Rafah and relocated north last week. The US military\u2019s temporary maritime corridor into the strip was\u00a0repaired Friday. The operation was dealt a major blow in May after only a few operational weeks, when a $320 million makeshift pier sustained damage in stormy seas off the Gaza coast, according to the Pentagon. The resulting overall quantity of aid entering Gaza has since dropped by 67%, according to the UN, to a daily average of 58 trucks between May 7 and May 28. For comparison, the UN previously reported that an average 500 trucks entered the strip per day in the months before October 7. \u201cEverything that has been in place in the Rafah and Kerem Shalom crossings has now changed,\u201d said Louise Wateridge a communications officer for UNRWA. \u201cWhen these crossings have been interrupted, it\u2019s just simply not enough coming from any other sources.\u201d Trucks stuck at the border Scenes have emerged of large relief trucks piling up at the border with Gaza, after Israeli authorities ramped up inspections on relief convoys entering the strip\u201a doubling down on claims that such aid could be used by Hamas. COGAT, the Israeli agency that manages aid flow into Gaza, said on June 4 that more than 1,000 trucks are waiting to be picked up by the UN on the Palestinian side of the Kerem Shalom crossing \u2013 accusing the UN of failing to coordinate the entry of the vehicles into Gaza. But rights groups say the \u201csystematic obstruction at Israeli-controlled crossing points\u201d and increased fighting is paralyzing truck deliveries. Wateridge told CNN that trucks stuck at Kerem Shalom cannot be received due to intense military action on the Gazan side of the crossing. \u201cIt\u2019s just a complete waste of vital humanitarian aid, and it\u2019s such a manmade situation,\u201d she said. These distribution challenges come as the UN\u2019s food agency warned in May that Palestinians in the north are under a \u201cfull-blown famine\u201d that is spreading south. More than one million people, half of Gaza\u2019s population, are \u201cexpected to face death and starvation\u201d by mid-July, another UN report warned this week, as civilians struggle to find enough food amid scarce market supplies and rising prices. More than 7,000 children under the age of five have already been diagnosed with malnutrition, according to the UN\u2019s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. With aid stocks in rapid decline, workers can barely meet demands on the ground, according to Mahmoud Shalabi, the senior program manager of the NGO Medical Aid for Palestinians. \u2018No safe corridors\u2019 for humanitarians For the few aid trucks that do enter the strip, damaged roads from Israeli strikes and security concerns over ongoing hostilities are stifling attempts to reach displaced Palestinians, human rights workers told CNN. Relief agencies have repeatedly called for new entry routes, more trucks to get through daily border checks, fewer obstacles to the movement of humanitarian workers and guarantees for their safety. Israeli attacks on aid convoys have sparked fierce condemnation from rights groups, drawing attention to growing Western skepticism of Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. Since October 7, Israeli forces have struck known locations of aid workers in the enclave at least eight times, despite agencies providing their coordinates \u201cto ensure their protection,\u201d according to Human Rights Watch (HRW). The attacks \u201creveal fundamental flaws with the so-called deconfliction system, meant to protect aid workers,\u201d according to the report. CNN previously asked the Israeli military for a response to the HRW report. \u201cIt\u2019s really unsafe for us humanitarians, there are no safe corridors, no movement coordinations,\u201d said Shalabi. Shalabi says he, his wife and children have been forced to flee at least three times since October. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what\u2019s going to happen next,\u201d he added. \u201cI hope I will be able to return to my home and resume whatever life I had before I was displaced.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/middleeast/gaza-humanitarian-aid-israel-dg-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/09/2024", "section": "world"}}

The two-day national college entrance exam, known as \u201cgaokao,\u201d is the world\u2019s largest academic test. It has also been billed by Chinese state media as \u201cthe world\u2019s toughest\u201d college entrance exam due to its high stakes, competitiveness and intensity, with students pouring everything they\u2019ve learned in 12 years into a handful of subject tests that each last less than two hours. More than 13.4 million students registered for the exam this year, surpassing last year\u2019s record of 12.9 million to make it the biggest \u201cgaokao\u201d ever held in China. Chinese students spend years cramming for the punishingly difficult exam, as a high score is the only way to get into the country\u2019s top universities. The exam includes subjects like Chinese literature, math, English, physics, chemistry, politics and history. The overwhelming majority of students get just one shot at the grueling test, unlike US students who can retake SAT exams. And the specter of China\u2019s slowing economic growth and soaring youth unemployment has piled on the pressure to perform. On Friday, the first day of the exam, parents waited anxiously outside school gates after sending their children off into exam halls. Many parents and teachers were dressed in red, the color of victory in China, and some held sunflowers \u2013 deemed an auspicious flower for academic success. Authorities have rolled out a slew of measures to maintain order and stability around the examination sites. In Beijing,\u00a0traffic police appeared on the streets as early as 6 a.m. to help smooth and reduce the flow of traffic around a school near the Summer Palace, a famous scenic spot popular with tourists, state news agency Xinhua reported. In Shanghai, taxi dispatch centers started accepting bookings for students taking the exam from a week ago, according to Xinhua. Chinese social media was awash with good-luck messages and encouragement, with \u201cgaokao\u201d trending as a top search topic on X-like platform Weibo. Many Chinese celebrities \u2013 and even some international stars \u2013 have posted on social media wishing the exam takers good luck. British soccer legend David Beckham posted his well wishes on Weibo, where he boasts 10 million fans. \u201cI just want to say \u2018good luck\u2019 to all the students that are taking their exams soon.

And heat hasn\u2019t peaked yet. July-like high temperatures will top out at 20 to 25 degrees above normal in multiple Western states this week and could break several daily record high temperatures. Thursday will be the hottest day of the week for millions of people. The temperatures will be dangerous for those exposed to the elements and unable to cool off. Relief from the heat won\u2019t be found at night, either \u2013 another symptom of a world warming due to fossil fuel pollution. The extreme heat already turned deadly over the weekend with worse to come. Excessive heat warnings are in effect for nearly 19 million people in California, Nevada, Arizona and Utah and South Texas. The warnings are the most extreme form of heat alert issued by the National Weather Service and are used when widespread, dangerous heat is expected. The soaring temperatures are being caused by a\u00a0heat dome, a large area of high pressure that parks over an area, traps air and heats it with abundant sunshine for days or weeks. The resulting heat becomes more intense the longer a heat dome lasts. SO HOT: The planet has just lived through a \u2018shocking\u2019 12-month streak of record heat. It\u2019s set to get worse The intense heat began Tuesday in parts of California and the West. Sacramento, California, hit triple digits for the first time this year while Las Vegas ended up just a degree shy of its hottest temperature of the year so far. Numerous daily records were also broken in Texas. Temperatures will soar higher on Wednesday across a larger portion of the Southwest. The most extreme heat will avoid major population centers along the coast, but Los Angeles will still be 5 to 10 degrees warmer than normal this week. TELL US: Worried about affording air conditioning this summer? Share your story Triple-digit temperatures will become widespread in California\u2019s Central Valley Wednesday and stick around into the weekend. Conditions will also sizzle in Southern California\u2019s desert regions. Death Valley, the hottest place in the world, will likely reach a high temperature of at least 120 degrees by Thursday. Even the brutal desert landscape doesn\u2019t typically get this hot until mid-to-late June. Phoenix will likely hit 110 degrees for the first time this year by Thursday, even though the city doesn\u2019t typically encounter these temperatures until mid-June. High temperatures are forecast to climb into the low 110s in Las Vegas, likely tying this year with 2010 for the earliest such reading on record in the city. Summerlike heat will also send daily high temperature records tumbling. Phoenix; Las Vegas; Flagstaff, Arizona; Reno, Nevada; and Fresno, California, are just a handful of cities where the day\u2019s high temperature record could fall on one or more days this week. By Friday, records could be broken in parts of Oregon, Washington, Idaho and Colorado as heat expands north and east. Deadly heat on the US-Mexico border Dangerous heat isn\u2019t new for the far southern US. Brutal heat in Mexico crept north into southern Texas earlier this spring and has been unrelenting for weeks. Several cities along the Texas-Mexico border experienced their hottest May on record. The triple digit temperatures at the border proved deadly last weekend after US Border Patrol agents said four migrants died \u201cfrom heat stroke and dehydration.\u201d The deaths were part of \u201cseveral emergencies\u201d involving heat-related illnesses last weekend, according to the US Border Patrol, El Paso Sector. The sector includes portions of southeastern New Mexico and western Texas. Heat is the deadliest weather threat in the US. It kills more than twice as many people each year as hurricanes and tornadoes combined, according to the National Weather Service.

{"id": "2024_06_02_europe_russia-defense-ministry-shakeup-intl", "text": "Removing a long-time defense minister from his post is nothing out of the ordinary. Arresting five of his senior staff, however, is clearly more than just a search for fresh blood \u2014 especially in Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia. After the shock ouster, two weeks ago, of Sergei Shoigu as the minister for defense, a wave of arrests has gutted the defense ministry\u2019s top brass under the guise of an anti-corruption campaign. The timing is as intriguing as the arrests and reshuffle. After almost three years of failure on the battlefields in Ukraine, Russia has just gained the upper hand. It has, in recent weeks, launched a largely successful offensive in the north, toward Kharkiv, coupled with victories in the Donbas region in the east, too. Ukraine\u2019s crippling manpower shortage and dwindling ammunition supplies \u2014 exacerbated by months of stalling in the US Congress to approve a military support package \u2014 have also helped reverse Russia\u2019s fortunes. So the question then is, why shake up the ministry in charge of winning the war now? Analysts who spoke to CNN described the defense ministry as one of the most corrupt in the country. Russian state media has been disclosing military contracts worth eye-watering sums of money and publicly shaming the ministry\u2019s senior officials and their lavish lifestyles. But as one analyst told CNN, what we are witnessing is a \u201cvery complex polycentric game,\u201d one that is related to timing and Putin\u2019s existential search for victory against the West. Prigozhin message from the grave Hanging over this shake-up is the ghost of Yevgeny Prigozhin, boss of the Wagner mercenary group, who was also formerly known as \u201cPutin\u2019s Chef.\u201d Before his death, he had expressed hatred for Shoigu and Russia\u2019s top general, Valery Gerasimov, through profanity-laden tirades, accusing them and the ministry of corruption and incompetence. Prigozhin led a mutiny on Moscow that was supposed to end with the overthrow of Shoigu and Gerasimov. Instead, he put the president in an awkward position and challenged his authority. Putin responded by describing Prigozhin as a traitor and stripped him of his assets, all before he died in a suspicious plane crash, alongside his most senior advisers. Since then, Putin has kept the inefficiencies of the ministry\u2019s weapons procurement, as well as its bungled invasion of Ukraine and corruption allegations, out of the public eye, keen to show he would not make any knee-jerk reactions following the mutiny. Doing so might question his authority and strength to the Russian people. Putin was likely awaiting his reelection by the Russian people in March before making moving in on the defense ministry. The changes came shortly after Victory Day celebrations on May 9, which Putin and Shoigu attended, side by side, in a seemingly amicable appearance. Despite his removal as defense minister, Shoigu will remain in Putin\u2019s orbit after being moved sideways to a new role as secretary of the security council. Putin\u2019s interests: Ukraine Tatiyana Stanovaya, Senior Fellow at Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, told CNN that whether Prigozhin may have been right about the officials\u2019 corruption is not what\u2019s important. In Russia, she said, \u201cright and wrong doesn\u2019t exist in politics \u2014 only interests matter.\u201d Putin\u2019s interest is in keeping his house in order but, more pressingly, achieving victory in Ukraine. The defense ministry is central to how that war ends. With Putin installing a civilian economist, Andrey Belousov, as the new defense minister, he has signaled he wants the ministry, with its vast budget, to procure weapons more quickly and economically. Russia\u2019s 2024 budget shows it is seeking to spend 6% of GDP on defense, the highest in modern Russian history, and will outpace social spending \u2014 a sign of the country\u2019s transition to a wartime economy. The corruption in question \u2013 Shamarin and Ivanov Mikhail Komin, a Russian political scientist and Visiting Fellow at the European Council of Foreign Affairs based in Vienna, told CNN that \u201cShoigu\u2019s group, among the Russian elites, is one of the most rent-seeking. More, for example, than some of Putin\u2019s inner circle.\u201d Last Friday, Lieutenant General Vadim Shamarin, chief of the Main Communication Directorate of the Russian Armed Forces, was charged with \u201creceiving a bribe on an especially large scale,\u201d of 36 million rubles (around $393,000) from a factory that supplies the ministry with communications equipment. In exchange, he is alleged to have awarded the company lucrative government contracts. Shamarin has pleaded not guilty, according to Russian state media. Russian state media has also played a role in communicating the Kremlin\u2019s crackdown on the ministry. Following Shamarin\u2019s arrest in May, state-run Ria Novosti reported that his wife had purchased a Mercedez-Benz GLE in 2018 for 20 million rubles (about $218,000) at a time when his income was no higher than $34,000. A separate report found her income that year was 872,000 rubles ($9,740). The highest profile of the five officials arrested was Timur Ivanov, the deputy defense minister. He was put under house arrest in late April, also on suspicion of taking bribes. Ivanov had become a focus of the Anti-Corruption Foundation, founded by Alexey Navalny, who was killed in a Russian prison in February. He and his organization exposed the lavish lifestyle enjoyed by Ivanov\u2019s partner \u2014 visiting invite-only jewelers, wearing couture clothing and owning a chalet in the chic ski resort of Courchevel in France. They questioned how she afforded such a lifestyle when her husband\u2019s salary was officially $175,000 a year. Russian state media reported that Ivanov maintains his innocence, citing its own source. There can\u2019t be overlap, but corruption will still remain For Stanovaya, the reasons for replacing figures such as Ivanov and Shamarin are simple. \u201cPart of Putin\u2019s logic is that you can\u2019t field someone in this position (as defense minister) where there are significant interests of the previous.\u201d To help clean up the ministry, Putin has appointed Oleg Savelyev, a former auditor at the Russia Accounts Chamber, as the deputy minister of defense. He will be \u201caware of the corruption that already exists in the defense sector,\u201d Komin said. Prigozhin\u2019s final wish Given the sweeping changes made by the president, rumors have swirled about the position of the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces, Valery Gerasimov, the other target of Prigozhin\u2019s rants. Stanovaya said, \u201cThere are so many rumors now that he [Gerasimov] might be dismissed soon,\u201d but the fact he has so far been spared gives Gerasimov \u201ca window to start fighting for his own interests,\u201d she added. \u201cGerasimov is fighting against his enemies, trying to secure his future,\u201d Stanovaya said. Komin agreed that Gerasimov may keep his position for now, as Putin has said he does not intend to make any other changes. Crucially, Komin suggested that Gerasimov\u2019s luck may be that there lacks a position, similar to Shoigu\u2019s where he can publicly be moved aside without completely tarnishing his reputation, \u201cit\u2019s not a big deal to find the new guy. It\u2019s more a big deal to find the place for the previous guy.\u201d In Putin\u2019s Russia the president remains laser focused on winning in Ukraine, but recent overtures have shown that the supporting cast may change and the president is ready to be ruthless in his search of victory.

That sure\u00a0seems\u00a0like the kind of thing US lawmakers might want to regulate on a level comparable to the federal government\u2019s strict oversight of, say, narcotics or cigarettes, or even TikTok. But Congress hasn\u2019t passed a single bill on AI, and a bipartisan \u201croadmap\u201d released last month is far from certain to be taken during an election year. (Which is ironic, given that one of the priorities of the roadmap is making sure AI doesn\u2019t, like, hijack the American electoral process.) Unsurprisingly, then, we\u2019re relying on the understaffed, underfunded Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department to try to keep Big Tech in line through enforcement. See here: Antitrust officials at the FTC and the Justice Department are nearing a final agreement this week on how to jointly oversee AI giants including Microsoft, Google, Nvidia, OpenAI and others, my colleague\u00a0Brian Fung reports. The agreement suggests a broad crackdown is coming, and fast. But likely not fast enough. The proverbial AI horse has left the barn, and it\u2019s running wild. Nvidia, a chipmaking company few people had heard of even a year ago, recently joined the $3 trillion club, briefly surpassing Apple as the second most valuable publicly traded company in the United States. Microsoft remains the No. 1 company by market cap, a feat it owes to its investments in ChatGPT maker OpenAI. All of that money was able flood in because the notoriously tech-challenged lawmakers in Washington have been largely asleep at the wheel. (European officials, meanwhile, formally adopted the world\u2019s first standalone AI law this spring, a full five years after rules were proposed.) The money part can\u2019t be overstated. Until recently, AI was a largely academic subject rarely discussed outside of Silicon Valley. Then OpenAI blew the door off its hinges by unleashing ChatGPT to the world, setting off a gold rush that\u2019s become the hottest play on Wall Street. And that is exactly what a group of current and former OpenAI employees are now warning about. \u201dAI companies have strong financial incentives to avoid effective oversight,\u201d they wrote\u00a0in an open letter\u00a0this week. \u201cSo long as there is no effective government oversight of these corporations, current and former employees are among the few people who can hold them accountable to the public. Yet broad confidentiality agreements block us from voicing our concerns, except to the very companies that may be failing to address these issues.\u201d In other words, we\u2019re counting on the newly wealthy tech nerds to self-regulate.

{"id": "2024_06_06_africa_sudanese-government-accuses-militia-massacre-intl", "text": "At least 150 people were killed and 200 injured in an attack by rebel forces in Sudan, local officials and witnesses said, in the latest atrocity in the year-long war that has displaced more than 7 million people. Eyewitnesses told CNN Thursday how fighters from Sudan\u2019s paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) descended upon Wad al-Nour village in the central Al-Jazira state on Wednesday. They described scenes of terror and carnage as over 40 armed vehicles stormed the village, unleashing heavy weaponry on its inhabitants, killing and wounding mostly civilians, among them children and women. Fighting is still ongoing just a few kilometers away, with terrified villagers fearful of further escalations, the witness said. Another eyewitness reported the ongoing grim task of counting the dead and injured. \u201cSo far, we\u2019ve buried more than 120 people in a mass grave in the middle of the village,\u201d he said. CNN cannot independently verify the exact number of casualties. Footage shared on social media Wednesday, and geolocated by CNN, shows a large crowd in Wad Al-Noura village surrounding dozens of dead bodies, shrouded in white, as preparations were being made for their burial. Another video allegedly shows the RSF militia firing heavy and medium weapons towards the village. Both the Sudanese army and the RSF have faced damning accusations of civilian massacres since the civil war broke out in April 2023. The RSF acknowledged the attack in a statement Wednesday and said it was a pre-emptive attack on\u00a0Sudan\u2019s Armed Forces (SAF),\u00a0camps in Wad Al-Noura in response to a planned attack by the army.\u00a0They did not acknowledge the civilian deaths reported. According to the RSF, eight of its fighters were killed, others injured, and they seized vehicles, weapons, and military equipment during the operation. However, eyewitnesses told CNN that there is no military presence in the village, adding that the Sudanese army operates a military base about 30 km (19 miles) southwest of Wad Al-Noura, which is being cited as a possible reason for the attack. CNN has contacted both RSF and the Sudanese Army for comment. The leader of the SAF vowed to retaliate after arriving in a city near the attack where he visited survivors, according to state news agency SUNA. \u201cThe response to the militia\u2019s crimes against the martyrs of [Wad al-Nour] will be severe and harsh,\u201d warned Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, SAF Commander-in-Chief and President of the Sudanese Transitional Sovereignty Council. A strategic target Wad al-Nour village lies about 160 kilometers south of Sudanese capital Khartoum and is now the latest epicenter of violence in a country ravaged by internal conflict. The village has long been a strategic target for the RSF, given its close location to Al-Manaqil, where the Sudanese army maintains its only presence in Al-Jazira state. This was not the first attempt by the RSF to control Wad al-Noura, as they have tried several times to take the village. Thousands have perished since fighting erupted between forces loyal to two rival generals \u2013 army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, leader of the SAF, and General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, head of the RSF. Since the conflict started, both the Sudanese army and the RSF have faced damning accusations of civilian massacres. The RSF has specifically targeted villages in Al-Jazira, Sudan\u2019s agricultural heartland, to swell its ranks through forced conscription and using hunger as a weapon, eyewitnesses have said. In March, eyewitnesses told CNN\u00a0that more than 700 people, including dozens of children, were forcibly recruited from the state by the militia group after being ordered to \u201cenlist or die.\u201d The RSF denied this claim. International outcry and humanitarian crisis The Sudanese Transitional Sovereignty Council condemned the RSF\u2019s actions, describing them as part of a systematic campaign of violence against civilians. \u201cThis heinous crime is added to the series of crimes committed by this rebel militia in many states of Sudan. These are criminal acts that reflect the systematic behavior of these militias in targeting civilians, plundering their property, and forcibly displacing them from their areas,\u201d the Council stated. A UN representative on Thursday expressed deep concern over the reported violence and called for a thorough investigation and accountability for those responsible. \u201cEven by the tragic standards of Sudan\u2019s conflict, the images emerging from Wad Al-Noura are heart-breaking. Wars have rules that need to be respected, no matter what,\u201d UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Sudan Clementine Nkweta-Salami said. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) has warned that \u201cthe number of people displaced by conflict inside Sudan could top 10 million in the coming days.\u201d \u201cThe world\u2019s worst internal displacement crisis continues to escalate, with looming famine and disease adding to the havoc wrought by conflict,\u201d IOM said in a statement on Thursday. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs noted that over 8.8 million people have fled their homes, and 24.8 million urgently need assistance.

{"id": "2024_06_08_india_modi-india-foreign-policy-intl-hnk", "text": "Narendra Modi has raised India\u2019s stature on the global stage like no other recent leader of the world\u2019s most populous country. The prime minister \u2013 who secured a rare third term in office this week \u2013 has positioned India and its fast-growing economy as a crucial player in global issues like climate change and development, while cementing New Delhi as a key security partner for the United States and an aspiring leader of the Global South. Modi\u2019s victory will give the 73-year-old leader and his Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) another five years to raise India\u2019s global stature \u2013 and to manage its contentious relationships and contested borders with nuclear-armed neighbors China and Pakistan. But the election results also place Modi in a radically different position from the one he enjoyed during his first decade in power. The larger-than-life leader and his BJP fell well short of an expected outright majority and must rely on coalition partners to form a government. That has widely been seen as a shock setback for the leader and his party, who have been accused by critics of fueling Islamophobia and religious violence in India, while rolling back civil liberties and failing to solve livelihood issues like soaring youth unemployment. Now, Modi will need to \u201cdevote a lot of time to (domestic affairs to) keep the government intact with a coalition with different agendas,\u201d said T.V. Paul, author of \u201cThe Unfinished Quest: India\u2019s Search for Major Power Status from Nehru to Modi.\u201d \u201cThis idea of India pushing its weight around may be much less feasible for the time being, given that foreign policy issues did not impact the (election) decision as much as people had thought.\u201d Power politics One aspect of India\u2019s international ambitions that\u2019s unlikely to shift in Modi\u2019s new term is New Delhi\u2019s relationship with Washington \u2013 a connection that has helped burnish the prime minister\u2019s profile as a power player. India has emerged as a key security partner for the US, a pillar of its Quad security grouping alongside Japan and Australia, and expanding cooperation on high tech and defense in the face of shared concern about an increasingly assertive and powerful China. In a congratulatory message to Modi on his win earlier this week, US President Joe Biden hailed the US-India friendship as \u201conly growing as we unlock a shared future of unlimited potential.\u201d That relationship is only likely to strengthen in the near term, according to analysts. \u201cThe two countries have shared concerns over regional stability and are overseeing a burgeoning defense cooperation,\u201d said Farwa Aamer, director of South Asia Initiatives at the Asia Society Policy Institute in New York. \u201cWe can expect a more assertive India aligning closely with US interests in the Indo-Pacific and expanding tech cooperation.\u201d Ties between New Delhi and Washington have warmed in recent years even as Modi has firmly pursued India\u2019s policy of strategic autonomy to push for a global order not purely dominated by the US or the US-China rivalry \u2013 another goal expected to remain unchanged by the election. For example, New Delhi has refused to give up its close relations with Russia, despite US pressure for its partners to cut ties with the warring country. But one question is how Modi\u2019s third term will affect percolating concerns in American policy circles about a widely documented backsliding of civil liberties in India under his right-wing leadership \u2013 as well as accusations the BJP aims to marginalize the country\u2019s Muslim minority of more than 200 million. India has also faced significant allegations of extraterritorial overreach, which raise questions about the risks of the country\u2019s growing confidence, assertiveness \u2013 and commitment to international norms \u2013 under Modi. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in September said his country was investigating \u201ccredible allegations\u201d linking India to the killing of a Canadian citizen and prominent Sikh leader. New Delhi hit back fiercely, accusing Canada of harboring terrorists and not acting against extremists, even as it denied the allegation. Two months later, US prosecutors also alleged that an Indian agent was behind a foiled murder-for-hire plot targeting an American Sikh activist. New Delhi denied any involvement in that alleged plot and set up a high-level committee to investigate the accusation. A changed India? One factor to watch following Modi\u2019s bruising election win, experts say, is whether the new government\u00a0ramps up or tones down posturing\u00a0that impacts\u00a0India\u2019s relations with its South Asian neighbors. They point to how Hindu nationalism over the past decade has not only stoked division and violence within the country, but threatened to inflame frictions in the region, especially with Pakistan \u2013 often the target of heated BJP rhetoric. Now, Modi\u2019s BJP will need to answer the interests of its coalition allies \u2013 and face stronger checks from a resurgent opposition, which could dampen its Hindu-nationalist agenda. And analysts stress it will take time to see how the BJP calibrates policy\u00a0aims and rhetoric\u00a0based on this new political reality. \u201cIf it is normal politics, it would seem that the elbows would not be as sharp on various issues,\u201d said Sushant Singh, a lecturer at Yale University in the US.\u00a0\u201cBut to cater to their nationalist support base, (the BJP)\u00a0may actually take the other path,\u201d to ramp up rhetoric, he added. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to see what political call is taken.\u201d Such a reaction could also be driven by the BJP\u2019s relative position of weakness going into this term, observers say, noting that Modi\u2019s landslide win in the 2019 elections followed a ratcheting of tensions with Pakistan. Then, India claimed to have\u00a0launched airstrikes\u00a0on what it alleged was a terrorist training camp across its de facto border with Pakistan after a car bombing killed Indian paramilitary forces, in an incident disputed by Islamabad. The BJP uses the \u201cotherization of the image of Pakistan to rally its core Hindutva base,\u201d said Fahd Humayun, an assistant professor of political science at Tufts University in the US, referring to the ruling party\u2019s ideology that India is inherently a land for Hindus. \u201cTo that end, it is not difficult to imagine a scenario in which, with its back against the wall, an embattled Modi government plays up the perceptions of external threats to try and rally domestic constituencies.\u201d In his weakened position, Modi may also be pressed to respond assertively to any perceived threats from China, observers say. Modi has appeared unwilling to risk confrontation with India\u2019s militarily superior neighbor, despite being slammed by critics for what they say was a soft response to deadly 2020 clashes along their disputed Himalayan border. Governments and policymakers across the world will be watching for how these issues evolve in the coming months. In the meantime, some observers suggest that while the election results may not have boosted Modi, they are already a boon for India\u2019s global clout. \u201cIf he has won a (super) majority and pushed the Hindu agenda, it would have probably dented India\u2019s (international) agenda,\u201d said Paul, the author, who is also a professor at McGill University in Canada. Paul said democracy was \u201cIndia\u2019s biggest soft power tradition\u201d and its perceived resurgence in the election may boost the country\u2019s image among liberal nations. \u201cIndia coming back as a proper democracy is good for the world order in many senses,\u201d he added. But \u201cit all depends how Modi will play this game.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/08/india/modi-india-foreign-policy-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/09/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_06_india_india-opposition-rahul-gandhi-election-analysis-intl-hnk", "text": "At the start of the year, Narendra Modi launched his unofficial election campaign from the steps of a grand Hindu temple. India was about to enter a \u201cdivine\u201d era, he said, declaring the beginning of a \u201cnew time cycle.\u201d January\u2019s inauguration of the Ram Mandir, on the site of a destroyed mosque, analysts said, was the latest and most significant step in a years-long project, moving India away from its secular, pluralist founding principles and toward a new future as a Hindu nation. On Tuesday night, Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lost its seat in the town where the temple stands. The loss sent shock waves through a country where a firebrand ideology of Hindu nationalism has \u2013 over the last decade of Modi\u2019s leadership \u2013 been thrust into to the center of daily life. But as the election results showed, for many voters, his BJP\u2019s strident ideology could not compensate for far more pressing local issues, including soaring unemployment and rising inflation. The opposition \u2013 which had been all but written off by many pundits and polls \u2013 put on a far stronger showing than expected, winning seats in BJP strongholds while denting Modi\u2019s aura of invincibility. The INDIA alliance, a grouping of dozens of political parties with a breadth of political positions, won 235 out of 543 seats in the lower house of Parliament, denying the BJP its dream of forming a supermajority \u2013 and with it a mandate to enact radical change. The star face of that alliance, Indian National Congress lawmaker Rahul Gandhi, had long been ridiculed by Modi, disregarded by many analysts as an ineffective and weak leader. Not so anymore. Voters have sent a \u201cclear message\u201d to Modi, Gandhi said Tuesday night. \u201cWe do not want you.\u201d Though the opposition lost, for many it felt like a win. Modi will enter a third consecutive term as India\u2019s prime minister \u2013 becoming only the second person to do so - but must rely on his coalition allies in a way he has never done before. \u201cThe people\u2019s mandate has given befitting reply to the BJP and their politics of hate, corruption,\u201d Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge told reporters Wednesday. \u201cThis is a mandate in defense of the Constitution of India\u2026 and (a mandate) to save democracy.\u201d \u2018Not a normal contest\u2019 While the BJP alone still won more seats than the INDIA alliance combined, by many critics\u2019 accounts, there wasn\u2019t a level playing field. \u201cThis was not a normal contest,\u201d Indian activist Yogendra Yadav, told local news channel India Today. Gandhi, the scion of a political dynasty that has produced three prime ministers, was last year disqualified as a lawmaker, and handed a two-year jail sentence for defamation, in a ruling his supporters say was politically motivated. Gandhi was later reinstated as a lawmaker following an intervention from India\u2019s Supreme Court \u2013 and didn\u2019t serve prison time. Weeks before the election began, the Congress accused the BJP of crippling its ability to campaign after its accounts were frozen by the tax department, leaving it unable to use some $20 million in funds. Then came the arrest of Arvind Kejriwal, Delhi chief minister and head of the popular Aam Aadmi Party, who was taken into custody for alleged corruption, and is now back in jail after being released toward the end of the campaign. The BJP has repeatedly denied accusations of political motivation. \u201cHere is a contest where there is a stranglehold on power. The BJP had more money than\u2026 anyone else. They had the entire media of this country lined up as their spokesperson,\u201d Yadav said. \u201cIn this context, getting (235 seats) is defeat. There is no other word for it.\u201d A shift in trends No other place exemplifies the BJP\u2019s disappointment like the state of Uttar Pradesh in India\u2019s north. Home to more than 200 million people, the nation\u2019s most populous state lies in the heart of the \u201cHindi belt\u201d \u2014 the predominantly Hindi-speaking states where support for Modi is especially strong. It is governed by a firebrand monk turned BJP politician, Yogi Adityanath, whose Hindu-first policies have polarized people along religious lines. And on Tuesday, voters there appeared to put their faith in the hands of the INDIA alliance, electing their candidates to 43 out of 80 seats \u2013 seemingly rejecting this populist vision for a Hindu-first nation. The BJP won 33, down from 62 at the previous election. In Banswara, in the western state of Rajasthan, where Modi\u2019s election campaign took its most divisive turn, voters were also turned off. It was there that the Indian leader sparked a row over hate speech when he accused the Congress of wanting to distribute the country\u2019s wealth among Muslims, referring to them as \u201cinfiltrators.\u201d The BJP candidate there, a two-time incumbent lawmaker, lost his seat to a rival from a much smaller, regional party. \u201cThe BJP did not sell its Hindu agenda as much as it thought. Other countervailing factors have impacted the electorate,\u201d said T.V. Paul, a professor from McGill University. Modi did not define a single overarching issue or narrative for the election, so voters focused more on local matters, according to Milan Vaishnav from the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, \u201cIn the absence of that, what we\u2019ve got in a federal country like India is a series of state-by-state, local contests in which more mundane, parochial issues really matter,\u201d he said. \u201cJobs, inflation, local leaders, incumbency, caste, ethnicity, religion and those seem to have worked against the prime minister and his party.\u201d As results began to trickle in Tuesday night, and the Congress learned of its gains across the country, there were scenes of jubilation at its headquarters in the capital New Delhi. \u201cRahul Gandhi is the only hope our country has,\u201d said Lakshman Valhekar, who traveled more than 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) from his home state in Maharashtra for the result. \u201cI believe in them completely. BJP is done. BJP is out.\u201d The electorate has, said Paul from McGill University, \u201coccasionally shown their capacity to make large-scale challenge to any kind of authoritarian order that is being imposed on them.\u201d Sitting in front of a large crowd in New Delhi Tuesday, Gandhi pulled out a small, pocket-sized version of India\u2019s constitution. Holding the red and black book, the leader began to speak. \u201cTo save this,\u201d he said, \u201cwe have taken the first and biggest step.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/india/india-opposition-rahul-gandhi-election-analysis-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/09/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_04_10_style_graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers", "text": "Climbing up abandoned, unfinished floors and tightrope walking across balcony ledges, backpacks clanging with cans of alkyd and acrylic, a collective of Los Angeles graffiti artists have transformed their craft beyond urban aesthetics to champion community issues. Their choice of canvas: Oceanwide Plaza in Downtown LA. Occupying over a full square city block, the plaza was imagined as a vast mixed-use building project, offering city residents over 500 lavish condominiums, a five-star hotel, retail spaces, restaurants and a private 2-acre park. However, construction on the $1 billion project, which began in 2015, was shelved after the Chinese-backed contractor Oceanwide Holdings ran out of funding\u00a0in 2019 \u2014 and it has lain unfinished ever since. The plaza\u2019s status \u2014 and potential \u2014 as an eye-catching venue for their work spread by word of mouth within the graffiti community in recent months. Security at the site was known to be lax, an important detail as accessing the plaza\u2019s towers and other buildings constitutes trespassing. (The Los Angeles City Attorney confirmed to CNN that, as of April 3, criminal charges have been filed against 23 individuals, for violations including trespassing and possession of vandalism tools.) \u201cIt was like a gift from the graffiti gods\u2026 A giant canvas in the middle of downtown,\u201d tagger ENDEM told CNN, speaking on behalf of himself and his graffiti crew, NCT. \u201cWe were like, \u2018Let\u2019s do it right. Let\u2019s do it as if the whole world is going to see this.\u2019\u201d Historically, graffiti has often been used as protest art. While the practice dates back thousands of years, it\u2019s most commonly viewed in a contemporary context (within graffiti\u2019s \u201cmodern\u201d era, which dates back to the 1960s and 70s) as a creative vehicle for challenging societal norms and inequities \u2014 whether on the Berlin Wall in Germany or subway cars in New York City; whether painted by anonymous artists or well-known figures like Keith Haring or Banksy, even if the latter is, technically, anonymous himself. Still, neither ENDEM nor any of the other artists involved realized how famous their work on the Oceanside towers would become. Sharing his artwork on Instagram on January 31, a video from ENDEM quickly racked up tens of thousands of views: Vibrant images of bright block lettering splayed across the building\u2019s exterior paired with footage from the inside \u2014 the artist posing with shots of his spray paint cans, poised above the cityscape. The viral footage, among other visuals shared on social media, quickly opened the floodgates. Hitting Oceanside became a mark of credibility in the graffiti world; by mid-February, the number of tags and other graffiti pieces there were multiplying overnight. \u201cIt was an open house people going in and out. It was beautiful. It was like graffiti paradise,\u201d ENDEM said. \u201cIt felt exactly like the streets, but concentrated.\u201d Transformed in part into an art installation, Oceanwide became an opportunity for the graffiti artists to leave a message to the city below, and a call-out to policy makers who leave buildings to rot. \u201cGraffiti shows you where the city hurts,\u201d Roger Gastman, owner and founder of the LA-based arts organization Beyond the Streets, told CNN. Renowned for its large-scale exhibitions, immersive educational programs, pop-up events and partnerships, Beyond the Streets works to educate and celebrate the diverse dimensions of graffiti as a medium. To him, the mission of graffiti is clear: to challenge, educate, and redefine public perception of the medium. Earl Ofari Hutchinson, president of The Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable, a nonpartisan public policy forum\u00a0for civic participation and education,\u00a0sees the abandoned towers as amplifying the social issues of the community they are situated in, connecting the graffiti-laden structures to the urban blight that surrounds them in LA\u2019s Skid Row. Skid Row is a 50-block sector of downtown LA where between 8,000 and 11,000 unhoused people live in challenging, often squalid conditions. \u201cYou\u2019ve got tens of thousands of people displaced because of over urban development. And as a result of that, they\u2019re on the streets,\u201d Hutchinson told CNN, noting that the homeless population in Los Angeles is continuing to grow. (The Los Angeles Housing Services Authority reports a 9% increase in homelessness in LA county in 2023 and a 10% increase in the city from 2022.) \u201cNow, set right in the middle of that, you have\u2026 a development that will never be completed.\u201d \u201cWhat you have here is a classic urban nightmare brought on by very poor policies \u2014 fiscal, financial, budgetary and political problems (in) a city that has just gone off the rails in terms of over-development and lack of affordability,\u201d Hutchinson added. Still, Hutchinson is no fan of the graffiti either. To him, and many other LA residents who have said they disapprove of the \u201cvandalism,\u201d the plaza is a sore sight for eyes. \u201cThe problem is you\u2019re talking about violating public space and with no permission\u2026 that doesn\u2019t fly with me,\u201d Hutchinson said. \u201cThe fact of the matter is, the public has not given you approval. (And) the general public has to pay for the removal.\u201d Costs currently borne by the taxpayer at the Oceanwide Plaza site include the security details provided by the LAPD as well as the graffiti cleanup Hutchinson highlights. (\u201cThis has strained our deployment,\u201d LAPD Chief Michel Moore said during a February meeting of the Los Angeles City Council. \u201cWe have called in some officers on an overtime basis so that we can provide for these added patrols or station them at that site to deter vandals and others from gaining access.\u201d) Clean teams working in the neighborhoods surrounding Oceanwide remove on average some 2,000 square feet of graffiti per week, with that figure growing in recent months. \u201cPeople forget that people live here. People own businesses here and they don\u2019t want to have to spend the time and money to clean it up,\u201d said Blair Besten, executive director of the Historic Core of Downtown Los Angeles, an organization which works to improve the quality of life in downtown neighborhoods. The Historic Core prioritizes street sweeping, trash collection \u2014 and graffiti removal. \u201cI would hardly call what they\u2019re doing art,\u201d Besten argued of the Oceanwide taggers. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty sloppy and quick. They come in fast and they knock it out and they leave.\u201d But to Gastman, graffiti is a powerful form of expression, and a call-to-action \u2014 particularly for those who emanate from struggles within home life, gang life or societal turmoil. Graffiti culture can offer an unexpected support system for those the city has abandoned, Gastman said. It becomes a platform for them to make their voices heard. \u201cIn graffiti culture, a lot of us know each other. We\u2019re all friends. We have the same mentality \u2014 we\u2019re just trying to get up. We\u2019re just trying to get noticed,\u201d explained ENDEM. In the midst of an addiction that led to his rock bottom, graffiti became his lifeline, he explained. \u201cI was at my lowest of lows, still trying to stay sober, I needed some type of outlet,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cGraffiti is something that you can hold on to. Its bigger than me, its everyone, it\u2019s a community.\u201d In this, ENDEM believes that the beauty of Oceanwide isn\u2019t tangible. Rather, it lies in the birth of a new generation of graffiti writers. \u201cThey can erase the graffiti on buildings, but they can never erase the impact that it has on the city of Los Angeles and the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to it. Yes, it\u2019s vandalism. Yes, it\u2019s art, and it\u2019s everything in between,\u201d Gastman concluded. \u201cThis is a real culture. It\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/10/style/graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/09/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_08_europe_ukraine-stabilizes-north-pressure-east-russia-intl", "text": "Ukraine\u00a0has\u00a0stabilized the\u00a0northern Kherson front\u00a0after Moscow launched an offensive a month ago,\u00a0thanks to more weapons and permission\u00a0to use them\u00a0to target positions within Russia. But\u00a0its forces are being stretched elsewhere along the 1,000km (620 miles) long front line and\u00a0are\u00a0defenseless against Russia\u2019s deadly aerial glide bombs. A senior\u00a0officer in\u00a0Ukraine\u2019s\u00a0Security Service\u00a0(SBU),\u00a0who goes by the call sign Bankir,\u00a0and is\u00a0currently fighting in the\u00a0Kharkiv\u00a0region, told CNN the ability to hit Russian targets across the border\u00a0was\u00a0already having a positive impact. \u201cIt is now possible to conduct local counter-attack operations and recapture the territories that, for example, were captured by the enemy a week ago,\u2019 the SBU officer said. For much of the war,\u00a0Ukraine has been constrained when it comes to using powerful Western weapons against Russia. Kyiv\u2019s allies have\u00a0long\u00a0been adamant that their fighting machines\u00a0must\u00a0not strike within Russian territory for fear of provoking Moscow,\u00a0limiting their use to targets within Ukraine, including in occupied areas. But that changed in the wake of the Kharkiv offensive. First, European countries including France and Germany allowed Ukraine to strike targets within Russia, then, most significantly, the US gave the go ahead for Ukraine to use its weaponry around Kharkiv. \u201cOur policy using long-range strike weaponry to go into Russia hasn\u2019t changed, but what we have done is provide Ukraine the ability to counterfire, to fire back at those Russian troops that are firing at them and to be able to take out their artillery batteries as they\u2019re firing at the Ukrainians and I think that\u2019s going to prove to be very, very helpful to Ukraine going forward,\u201d Secretary of Defense Lloyd\u00a0Austin told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer. The US HIMARS system has become the go-to weapon system to hit the Russian positions, according to Yehor Cherniev, deputy chairman of the Ukrainian Parliament\u2019s Committee on National Security, Defense and Intelligence. Due to the threat of being hit by HIMARS, the Russians have begun to use S-300 and S-400 missile systems much less to fire at the Kharkiv region but glide bombs remain an issue. These are dropped from so high they are out of range of Ukrainian defenses. \u201cUnfortunately, we do not yet have permission to hit Russian aircraft at airfields with American weapons and we do not have permission to use ATACMS missiles on Russian territory,\u201d\u00a0said Cherniev,\u00a0referring to a long-range missile system.\u00a0\u201cBecause of this, we have not yet been able to resolve the problem of glide bomb strikes on our territory. Kharkiv and other border areas are still suffering from bombing attacks, and a lot of civilians die.\u201d While the Russian advance has slowed as assessed by the US and Ukraine, Moscow\u2019s forces continue to press along the new front line\u00a0in the north. Russians are focusing on trying to push through the village of Hlyboke north of Kharkiv. If Russian forces manage to take hold there they could push through to the village of Lyptsi which sits 30 kilometers north of Kharkiv \u2013 bringing the city with historic, cultural and industrial importance within artillery range. Northeast of Kharkiv, Russian forces continue to maintain a foothold in the town of\u00a0Vovchansk. The fighting has turned to close combat, with units fighting street by street, according to Nazar Voloshyn,\u00a0a Ukrainian military spokesman in the east.\u00a0But\u00a0\u201cmost of the city is under the control of the Ukrainian Defense Forces\u201d Voloshyn told CNN. \u201cTo disperse the forces and means of our defense forces, the enemy launched an additional Kharkiv campaign\u2026 they partially succeeded, but the defense forces stabilized the situation,\u201d said Yurii Fedorenko, a company commander with the 92nd Separate Mechanized Brigade currently fighting in the Kharkiv region. The UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) recorded a \u201csignificant increase\u201d (31%) in civilians killed in Ukraine in May compared to April. According to HRMMU, more than half of the casualties occurred in the new northern front and because of \u201cair-dropped bombs and missiles in populated areas such as communities near the front line and Kharkiv city.\u201d To counter the Russians\u00a0in Kharkiv, Ukraine has to\u00a0divert men and arms\u00a0from other parts of the front line in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. A main goal for Russia has been to exert complete control over the two eastern regions. And that\u2019s exactly where Russia has been pressing quite actively, according to Voloshyn. In the east, Moscow had set its sites on on the town of Chasiv Yar in the Donetsk region. Russian troops have made some advances. Further south along the eastern front line, Russians have made advances to the west of the city of Avdiivka which fell to Russian forces in February. \u201cThe Russian army is trying to do everything possible on the front line before the arrival of US aid to Ukraine and is trying to use this window of opportunity in all possible ways,\u201d according to Voloshyn. Russians are trying to seize the momentum as the weather and daylight hours make conditions more conducive to ground operations. They are also in race against the clock before more arms arrive from Ukrainian partners, particularly as the West is slowly coming around to allowing Ukraine to use the weapons on Russian territory. NATO F16s are expected to arrive shortly and France has pledged to equip Ukraine wih its Mirage\u00a02000-5 fighter jets. Western weapons and a new push to draft more soldiers in to the Ukrainian military could give Ukraine the boost it needs.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/08/europe/ukraine-stabilizes-north-pressure-east-russia-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/09/2024", "section": "world"}}

The union asked its members to take a day off on Friday, which falls between a public holiday on Thursday and the weekend. Son Woomok, a union leader, told CNN that \u201cmany employees used their annual leave today,\u201d and at one site \u201call workers had taken leave so replacement personnel were deployed.\u201d He did not provide other details. He had previously said many NSEU members work for Samsung\u2019s flagship semiconductor unit. That division is trying to regain its former status as a top semiconductor company, according to Reuters, which says Samsung has fallen behind its competitors SK Hynix\u00a0and Micron Technology\u00a0in delivering chips used in artificial intelligence (AI) processors. A Samsung spokesperson told CNN that, \u201cthere is no impact on production and management activities\u201d as a result of the one-day walkout. \u201cToday\u2019s annual leave use rate is lower than last year\u2019s Memorial Day holiday\u2019s annual leave use rate,\u201d the spokesperson added. The world\u2019s biggest memory chipmaker has had a rough few years. A historic\u00a0shortage\u00a0of computer chips during the Covid\u00a0pandemic\u00a0was followed by falling demand last year as consumer appetite for electronics remained weak because of global economic uncertainty. But things are looking up for the company because of the AI boom. It is optimistic about a resurgence in demand for mobile devices this year, particularly with the rollout of new products, such as AI-powered smartphones. Last month, Samsung reported a more than\u00a0tenfold rise\u00a0in first-quarter operating profit amid forecasts of high demand for AI and high-end chips, an area in which it competes with Intel (INTC) and Taiwan\u2019s TSMC. The vast majority of the world\u2019s advanced microchips are made in just two places: Taiwan and South Korea. Taiwan\u2019s industry is larger and more dominant, something South Korea is keen to challenge.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/tech/south-korea-samsung-workers-strike-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/09/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_middleeast_israel-lebanon-cross-border-tensions-escalate-intl", "text": "Tensions are escalating on the Israel-Lebanon border as the Israeli military warned it was prepared to launch a large-scale attack in the north to deter the Iran-backed Islamist group Hezbollah. Cross-border attacks from Lebanon led to large fires blazing through Israel\u2019s northern region this week, consuming swathes of land and leading to the evacuation of residents. Israel attributed the blaze to rocket fire from southern Lebanon, where Hezbollah said it had launched a \u201cswarm of drones\u201d at Israeli military sites. On Wednesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the northern city of Kiryat Shmona\u00a0near the Lebanese border, saying that Israel is prepared for \u201cvery intense action\u201d in the north. \u201cWhoever thinks that they can hurt us and that we will sit idly by is making a big mistake,\u201d the prime minister said. \u201cOne way or another, we will restore security to the north.\u201d Netanyahu\u2019s comments come after Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi said the Israeli military is ready to attack targets in the north. \u201cWe are prepared after a very good process of training \u2013 up to the level of a military exercise \u2013 to move to an attack in the north. Strong defense, readiness to attack, we are approaching a decision point,\u201d Halevi said on Tuesday. Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon have been trading fire since the start of Israel\u2019s war on Hamas in Gaza in October. In April, the IDF said it is \u201cpreparing to move from defense to attack,\u201d referring to operations on the northern border. The Lebanese group has said its attacks on Israel are in protest to Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. Naim Qassem, Hezbollah\u2019s second-in-command, told Al Jazeera on Tuesday that Hezbollah is a front to support Gaza \u201cand that front doesn\u2019t stop until the war (in Gaza) stops.\u201d He said that the group\u2019s assessment was that recent threats from Israel were not serious. \u201cEither way, we have decided not to widen the battle and we do not want an all-out war. But if it is imposed on us, we are ready and we won\u2019t retreat,\u201d he said. The IDF says it has killed around 300 Hezbollah fighters, and Reuters reported that around 80 civilians have been killed in Lebanon by Israeli fire. Ten Israeli civilians and 18 soldiers have also been killed on the border, the Israeli military said. More than 94,000 Lebanese have been displaced from areas and towns close to the border with Israel since the conflict started, according to figures released Tuesday by the Lebanese Ministry of Public Health. More than 53,000 Israelis have been evacuated from the country\u2019s north since hostilities began in October, the IDF told CNN. \u2018Strategic trap\u2019 \u201cIsrael has been caught in a strategic trap up north,\u201d Amos Harel, a defense analyst, wrote in Israeli newspaper Haaretz on Wednesday. \u201cIt has proven unable to force Hezbollah into a cease-fire as long as the fighting in Gaza continues, whereas the Lebanese organization has managed to create a kind of \u2018security zone\u2019 devoid of residents inside Israeli territory, despite suffering much higher losses than the IDF has.\u201d On Wednesday, far-right Israeli Minister of National Security Itamar Ben Gvir said it was now the IDF\u2019s job to \u201csimply to destroy Hezbollah\u201d. \u201cIt cannot be that our land is being targeted and harmed, and people here have evacuated,\u201d he said on Telegram. \u201cAll Hezbollah strongholds must be burned and destroyed. War!\u201d Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said in an interview with Israeli radio station Reshet bet however that the IDF isn\u2019t interested in broadening the war to eliminate Hezbollah. The military is \u201ctelling us right now that it doesn\u2019t want to\u2026 launch an attack in the north, fight and defeat Hezbollah, and overwhelm it and create a security zone.\u201d Amid an uptick in tensions on the border, senior Israeli minister Benny Gantz, a member of the war cabinet, has said that the country cannot afford to lose another year in the north. \u201cI have been fighting for months with the government, with the prime minister and with everyone, that by September 1 we will finish the job here and be able to start something else. It will happen with either a solution or escalation, but we can\u2019t lose another year here,\u201d he said. Last month, Gantz threatened to leave the national unity government unless a six-point plan was agreed by June 8 that included the return of residents displaced by attacks from Lebanon. An Iran-backed Islamist movement with one of the most powerful paramilitary forces in the Middle East, Hezbollah has opened another front against Israel. The group is seen as Iran\u2019s most effective non-state partner, possessing 150,000 rockets that could overwhelm Israel\u2019s defenses if an all-out war breaks out. A wider conflict could also draw Iran and the United States into the war. Israel and Iran came close to war in April after launching unprecedented direct attacks on each other\u2019s soil. \u201cNot only is there no military solution on the horizon (in northern Israel), but the time that\u2019s passed has led many to consider leaving the area permanently, especially with a new school year due to open in September,\u201d Harel wrote.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/middleeast/israel-lebanon-cross-border-tensions-escalate-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/09/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_08_china_hong-kong-uber-taxis-intl-hnk", "text": "They hire their Uber through the app just like any other passenger, and hop in the back of the car. But halfway through the ride, the mood changes and they reveal their identity. \u201cPull over here. It\u2019s you. You are in trouble for driving an Uber,\u201d the passenger tells his driver, during one of a few recent encounters captured in video and circulated online in Hong Kong. The passengers aren\u2019t traffic cops. They are vigilante taxi drivers taking direct action, having become increasingly frustrated about Hong Kong authorities\u2019 failure to regulate the ride-hailing platform. After the car pulls over, they hand over the driver, often still reeling in shock, to the police officers they have called. \u201cYou may say this is provocative. But without these videos, people may think we inflate the numbers of \u2018white-plate vehicles\u2019 out there,\u201d one of the taxi drivers who took part in a sting operation, and asked to be only identified as Ka Chun, told CNN. \u201cWhite-plate vehicles\u201d is how taxi drivers colloquially refer to Uber. \u201cWe just want the government to enforce the law.\u201d Uber remains technically illegal in Hong Kong, which it entered in 2014. But it has thrived under the ambiguous approach of officials keen to project an image of technological modernity. \u201cUber is often framed as innovation, which seems to contribute to the \u2018smart city\u2019 vision \u2013 something that the Hong Kong government has strived to be,\u201d said Oliver Chan, an assistant communications studies professor who specializes in the gig economy at Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK). Ads for the US-headquartered company are widespread, and its drivers are highly unlikely to face problems with the authorities. Taxi drivers have for years complained about how Uber has flouted local laws, upended the market, and chipped away their already modest earnings. But their recent acts of vigilantism appear to have backfired. Instead of rallying public support, the cabbies were on the receiving end of a backlash, with passengers taking to social media to share their bad experiences of rude taxi drivers, ride rejections and opportunistic charging during heavy rains and the city\u2019s regular summer typhoons. \u201cThey charge arbitrarily and refuse to take passengers. And yet, they have the audacity to go on sting operations,\u201d one person wrote on LIHKG, a popular local internet forum, adding: \u201cShameless people know no bounds.\u201d Others have retaliated by reporting law-breaking taxi drivers to police. Pictures of taxis parking in restricted areas flooded the internet in posts calling for people to report them. WhatsApp groups set up by Uber drivers also discuss how to retaliate, one driver told CNN. So tense is the backlash that Hong Kong leader John Lee, when asked about the furor by reporters last week, acknowledged the \u201cfierce public debate\u201d and appealed for calm. He urged taxi drivers to stay away from any vigilante acts. As with New York\u2019s amber-painted medallion taxis and London\u2019s black hackney cabs, Hong Kong\u2019s 15,000 red urban taxis are emblematic of the city. But they are not exactly known for their friendliness or reliable service. Passenger Lau Chi-tim recalled being charged double during a typhoon a few years ago. Drivers often charge a little more because their insurance does not cover extreme weather conditions. But Lau said: \u201cThe trip lasted only 15 minutes and most of the journey was inside a tunnel anyway. Where is the risk?\u201d Another passenger lamented how selective taxi drivers can be. \u201cPeople with pets, a pram, wanting to cross the harbor, or going anywhere that may be crowded\u2026 they just reject you,\u201d Jason Chan said. Similar complaints abound, despite refusal to take passengers being an offense under the Hong Kong law. Those who prefer Uber see it as an alternative to the poor service they have long tolerated and would rather pay a little more for a smoother ride. An Uber driver, who gave only his name Mo for fear of being identified by authorities, said passengers told him they preferred Uber drivers\u2019 manners, and quality of driving. \u201cWe don\u2019t dare swerve around on the road because it\u2019s our own vehicle,\u201d he said. But for Ka Chun, the driver who went undercover, it\u2019s about defending their interest and an institution that he and his fellow cabbies invested time and money to be part of. \u201cThey have an impact on us because these white-plate vehicles can take passengers without a taxi license,\u201d he said, speaking of a permit that can cost a fortune in the city where properties, and even parking spaces, are traded as speculative commodities. Hong Kong\u2019s transport authority has issued some 18,000 taxi licenses \u2013 including for non-urban blue and green cabs - and they are currently traded for up to $400,000 (HK$3.2 million) in a free market. Annual insurance for a taxi also costs up to 10 times that for private vehicles. Drivers who don\u2019t own a taxi pay rental of 550 Hong Kong dollars (about $70) for a 12-hour shift, almost a third of what they make on an average day, according to Ka Chun. \u201cUber drivers don\u2019t need any capital whatsoever as they are using their own car to take passengers,\u201d he said. Patrick Tam, secretary general of the Hong Kong Taxi & Public Light Bus Association, acknowledged the complaints against some unruly taxi drivers, and said he supported the police going after them. \u201cThese taxi drivers should face tough punishment. But it doesn\u2019t make vehicles operating without a proper license less of a problem,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just want fair treatment.\u201d So far, Hong Kong police have said they had not arrested any Uber drivers ensnared in the amateur sting operations. Estyn Chung, general manager of Uber in Hong Kong, noted that the company launched its Uber Taxi service in 2020 to give riders the option to get a taxi on its app. \u201cWe know from elsewhere around the world that taxi and ride-sharing services can thrive alongside each other. Hong Kong is not an exception,\u201d he said. Creating harmony between traditional cabbies and gig-economy drivers can be tricky. And CUHK\u2019s Chan said that, after years of ambiguity, Hong Kong is already playing catch-up. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to say the extent to which the government wants to promote Uber, and more broadly, ride-hailing platforms at this point,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Hong Kong\u2019s ride-hailing regulations lag behind, for example, Singapore.\u201d The city government is expected to unveil a study on online ride-hailing services in July. A spokesman said it is \u201copen-minded\u201d on the apps, though \u201cthey must be in compliance with the relevant law and regulations.\u201d \u201cThe government should require them to get a different driver permit and insurance even if it legalizes their operation,\u201d said Ka Chun. \u201cOtherwise, why should I get a taxi license? I could drive white-plate vehicles.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/08/china/hong-kong-uber-taxis-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/09/2024", "section": "world"}}
