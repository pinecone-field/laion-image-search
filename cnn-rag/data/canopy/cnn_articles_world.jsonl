There\u2019s the Art Deco curved crown of the Chrysler Building, the sweeping isosceles triangles that twist around One World Trade Center, the stepped limestone and granite rectangles of the Empire State Building and the triangular prism of the Flatiron Building. And now, a multi-billion-dollar tower featuring floor-to-ceiling glass will add another dimension to the cityscape, according to new details unveiled by New York City Mayor Eric Adams this week. Stretching up 62 stories, a planned office tower at 350 Park Avenue will provide space for more than 6,000 jobs, plus 1.8 million square feet of commercial office space, according to a press release. It will be funded by Vornado Realty Trust, Kenneth Griffin, founder and CEO of global investment firm Citadel, and building and management company Rudin. White columns will frame a new public concourse at the base of the new building on Park Avenue, complete with green space, seating and art displays, images show. Above, landscaped terraces will top each section of the glass-clad tower which will house the offices for Citadel and market making firm Citadel Securities. Adams hailed the project in the release, saying it will help \u201csupercharge our economy and expand New York City\u2019s iconic skyline,\u201d building on \u201ccontinued efforts to energize Midtown Manhattan as the world\u2019s most important business address and an economic engine for working-class New Yorkers.\u201d Architects Foster + Partners have designed the building, which will replace the existing 30-story tower currently at the site in Midtown Manhattan just a few blocks away from landmarks like the Rockefeller Center, St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral and Grand Central Station. As New York continues to deal with the economic aftershocks wrought by the Covid-19 pandemic, Adams and his administration said in their respective statements that they hoped this project would continue the city\u2019s recovery. \u201cThis investment opens a new chapter for Midtown \u2014 and closes the book on those who predicted its demise,\u201d said deputy mayor for operations Meera Joshi. \u201cMidtown\u2019s revitalization is being led by its public realm \u2014 including investments in Fifth Avenue, with the crown jewels of Central Park and Bryant Park at either end. Together, with our business improvement district and parks partners, we are reintroducing Fifth Avenue to the world and creating a vibrant live, work, play community for a new era,\u201d Joshi added. Building this new office space comes at a fraught time for the commercial real estate market as businesses struggle to entice workers back to the office after years of working from home. This has left vast tranches of office space vacant or underused, causing the value of such buildings to plummet at the same time as historically high interest rates have made it harder for real estate developers \u2014\u00a0who often take out huge loans to finance projects \u2014\u00a0to make good on their repayments. The project will begin the city\u2019s public review process early next year and the tower is expected to be completed by 2032, according to the release.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/20/style/park-avenue-skyscraper-new-york-skyline-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_25_europe_carlo-acutis-mother-sainthood-pope-francis-intl", "text": "The mother of an Italian teenager set to become the Catholic Church\u2019s first millennial saint has told of her \u201cgreat joy\u201d as she portrayed her son as an otherwise ordinary boy who enjoyed video games and pets. Carlo Acutis \u2013 whose computing skill helped him spread the message of the Catholic Church and earned him the nickname \u201cGod\u2019s Influencer\u201d - died from leukemia in 2006 aged 15. A second miracle attributed to Acutis has been recognized by Pope Francis, paving the way for him to be made a saint. Candidates normally need to have two miracles attributed to them before they can be canonized. Speaking to CNN, his mother, Antonia Salzano, said that the news of the approval of the second miracle was a \u201cgreat joy\u201d, and that Carlo is a \u201csign of hope\u201d who shows that holiness is possible today. \u201cAs I did: you too can become holy\u201d she said.\u00a0\u201cNevertheless, [with] all the media the technologies it seems sometimes that holiness is something that belongs to the past. Instead, holiness is also something nowadays in this modern time.\u201d She said her son was bought a PlayStation when he was eight, but limited himself to one hour a week of gaming as he was wary that it could become addictive and that he knew the \u201cdangers of the internet\u201d. Along with his computing and gaming, Carlo played the saxophone, enjoyed soccer, loved animals and would make short, humorous films of his dogs. Ms Salzano said her son used his computer skills \u201cnot to do things for earning money or to become famous but to spread the Gospel [the message of Jesus Christ], to help people,\u201d and was \u201cfull of joy.\u201d While he had similar interests to other kids, the soon-to-be-saint was unafraid to stand out from the crowd. His mother said that the age of nine the youngster spent time helping the homeless in Milan and giving his pocket money to those sleeping on the streets. She explained that he insisted on only having one pair of shoes, so he could save money to help the poor. He was also unafraid to stand up for the victims of bullying and resist peer pressure. According to Nicola Gori, author of\u00a0\u2018Carlo Acutis: The First Millennial Saint\u2019\u00a0and the postulator (guide) of his sainthood cause, Acutis once defended a girl from India who was targeted for wearing a sari, and he was known at school for his \u201ccheerfulness, energy, generosity.\u201d He was devoted to Saint Francis, the saint renowned for poverty, humility and care for creation, and the pope\u2019s namesake. Paolo Rodari, an Italian journalist who wrote a book about Acutis with Ms Salzano, told CNN that Acutis was a \u201cnormal guy\u201d who served others including the \u201cmany needy people who slept on the streets of Milan. To them he gave everything.\u201d Acutis became ill in early 2006 and was later diagnosed with Leukemia: he died on October 12. At his funeral two days later, a large crowd gathered with many of them immigrants to Italy and those belonging to a variety of religions. Devotion to Carlo quickly began to spread across the world, and his story was taken up by several Catholic youth groups. Ms Salzano hopes the canonization will either be later this year or next year.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/europe/carlo-acutis-mother-sainthood-pope-francis-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_30_europe_russia-sexual-violence-occupied-ukraine-intl-cmd", "text": "Within an hour of being arrested by Russian security forces, Roman Shapovalenko was threatened with rape. On August 25, 2022, the day after Ukraine\u2019s Independence Day, he said three armed, masked officers from Russia\u2019s Federal Security Service (FSB) stormed his home in the southern Ukrainian port city of Kherson, which was occupied by Russian forces at the time. They turned his house inside out searching for incriminating evidence. A message in Shapovalenko\u2019s phone that called Russian soldiers \u201corcs\u201d \u2014 a derisive reference to the evil forces in J. R. R. Tolkien\u2019s Middle-earth books and a popular Ukrainian slur for the Russian army \u2014 was enough for them. He said he was tied up, blindfolded and stuffed into an unmarked car. For days after, Shapovalenko said he was repeatedly electrocuted in his genital area, threatened with being raped with a glass bottle, and was even made to believe he could be sterilized. \u201cThey seemed to have a fetish for genitalia. Sometimes the door would open, and they would say: \u2018We\u2019re going to take out our batons and we\u2019re going to rape everyone here,\u2019\u201d the 39-year-old farm manager told CNN. Describing the graphic detail of his experience matter-of-factly, Shapovalenko sometimes paused to laugh nervously. He said his sense of humor is helping with what he knows will be a long recovery. The Russians, he said, hated it. \u201cI made a little joke, and they didn\u2019t like it. I got punched for that.\u201d Shapovalenko\u2019s experience of sexual violence at the hands of Russian forces is common among Ukrainians \u2013 including civilians and soldiers \u2013 who have been detained since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of the country more than two years ago. Human rights monitors have long reported on the rampant use of sexual violence by Russian police and security forces against prisoners and detainees in Russia. Now it seems Russia is exporting the practice to occupied Ukraine. Few men have spoken publicly about their ordeal, but Ukrainian prosecutors and rights groups say male victims make up a growing proportion of cases. The crimes often go unreported because of the stigma and shame associated with them. The latest United Nations Security Council annual report into conflict-related sexual violence said that 85 cases had been documented in Ukraine in 2023 \u2013 affecting 52 men, 31 women, one girl and one boy. A separate report from UN rights officials who interviewed 60 male Ukrainian prisoners of war following their release found that 39 were victims of sexual violence while in Russian detention. CNN interviewed four male survivors, two in person and two by phone, and obtained testimonies from two more, who were held by Russian units across five Ukrainian regions that have been occupied or annexed by Moscow: Kherson, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, Kharkiv and Crimea. All described being subjected to forced nudity, genital electrocution \u2013 most often with wires from the Soviet-era military field telephone TA-57, known as \u201cTapik\u201d \u2013 and threats of rape. Their accounts tallied with cases documented by regional prosecutors in Kyiv, Kherson and Kharkiv and were corroborated by witnesses held in the same detention facilities in Kharkiv and Kherson. Taken together, their stories capture what prosecutors describe as Russia\u2019s systematic and continuing use of sexual violence in occupied areas as part of its efforts to force the Ukrainian people into submission. \u201cWe see it over and over again in different regions under occupation. They use the same method of committing sexual violence, the same method of humiliation, the same method of how they explain it to their victims,\u201d said Anna Sosonska, a Ukrainian prosecutor and the acting chief of the conflict-related sexual violence division in Ukraine\u2019s Office of the Prosecutor General. Speaking to CNN from her office in Kyiv, Sosonska said that a significant number of documented crimes of sexual violence by Russian troops, including forced nudity, genital mutilation, rape and forced exposure to sexual violence against others, were being carried out against men. \u201cEspecially by using electric current on genitals \u2013 that is the top of the list,\u201d she said. \u2018They all laughed\u2019 Roman Chernenko said he spent seven months in a \u201cpunishment cell\u201d in a prison in the occupied city of Olenivka, in the eastern Donetsk region, after he was captured by Russian troops in Mariupol area. The 29-year-old intelligence officer with the Ukrainian military \u2013 who goes by the call sign \u201cOmen\u201d \u2013 described being tortured as often as three times a day, every day, for four months. \u201cTapik is a military phone with two wires. One is connected to your balls, the other to your finger, and they just keep turning the current up,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cThey just keep twisting it until the person tells them what they need.\u201d He said he believes officers from Russia\u2019s GRU, the Russian Federal Penitentiary Service (FSIN) and the FSB, Russia\u2019s main intelligence agency, all took part in the torture. Chernenko was released as part of a prisoner exchange in January 2024 and is still recovering from the ordeal. Speaking to CNN a few weeks after his release, on the day he proposed to his girlfriend, he said it was his thoughts of her and his mother that gave him strength to survive captivity. \u201cThey laughed when they tortured me \u2026 they told me that my mother was being f**ked by Chechens. They took me to be shot twice, they threatened me with rape,\u201d he said. CNN asked Russia\u2019s Ministry of Defense, Interior Ministry, FSB, National Guard (Rosgvardia) and the military intelligence agency, known as the GRU, for comment on allegations of sexual violence at specific detention facilities, but has not received any response. Rape and sexual violence are explicitly prohibited by the Geneva Conventions \u2013 the set of international laws that regulate the conduct of armed conflict \u2013 and can constitute a war crime. Mock execution is considered a form of torture under international law. Under the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC), committing rape and sexual violence in a systematic or widespread way is considered a crime against humanity. According to Ukrainian prosecutors investigating conflict-based sexual violence and abuse, all available evidence indicates that it is a deliberate tactic, part of Russia\u2019s modus operandi in Ukraine. \u201cIt\u2019s in every region that was under occupation. Everywhere that Russian troops were located, we\u2019re seeing cases of sexual violence and gender-based violence. The bottom line is that it looks like it is Russian policy,\u201d Sosonska said. As of early May, Ukraine has officially recorded 293 cases of sexual violence, although Sosonska said that it is impossible to estimate the real number of crimes that are being committed, particularly in occupied territories which remain inaccessible to its investigators and prosecutors. Some 37,000 Ukrainian citizens are unaccounted for, according to the Ukrainian ombudsman\u2019s office, with thousands believed to be held in Russian detention and at risk of torture and sexual violence. But the real scale of sexual violence committed during the war may never come to light. Only a fraction of victims tend to come forward and, according to the UN, this is especially true for men, some of whom may not initially realize that what happened to them was a sexual violence crime. Some male victims of sexual violence may describe what happened to them instead as \u201ctorture.\u201d The distinction, Sosonska explained, is important for any future court cases and war tribunals. Her office is also trying to educate the public about the fact that men can be victims of sexual violence \u2013 something Sosonska said may still not be fully understood. Anna Mykytenko, who heads the Ukraine team at Global Rights Compliance (GRC), an international legal non-profit, said that Ukrainian witnesses and survivors of sexual violence have testified that Russian troops told them it was a \u201cpunishment.\u201d \u201cIn several villages in the south we heard witnesses and survivors say that the Russian servicemen came in, occupied the village, and then looked specifically for the wives of Ukrainian soldiers, or their mothers or sisters,\u201d Mykytenko told CNN. GRC acts as the co-lead of the Atrocity Crimes Advisory Group, an initiative launched by the European Union, the United States and the United Kingdom to provide Ukraine with assistance in the investigation and prosecution of atrocity crimes. Mykytenko said that while most cases of conflict-related sexual crimes that were reported and investigated earlier in the war concerned female victims, many of the cases recently recorded have been against male victims, especially against men held in captivity. \u201cSexual crimes are fairly common in detention centers and it\u2019s very common for prisoners of war or civilians to be threatened with rape or with the sexual abuse of different types, this is something that\u2019s almost normal for the Russian and Russia-related armed forces,\u201d she said. \u2018A systematic approach\u2019 The Ukrainian ombudsman\u2019s office told CNN it believes that the Russian armed forces and Ministry of Defense, as well as the Russian Federal Penitentiary Service, are the Russian government bodies officially responsible for what happens inside detention facilities. However, it is Rosgvardia \u2013 a paramilitary police force deployed to keep order in occupied regions of Ukraine \u2013 and the FSB that appear to be driving the campaign of torture and sexual violence against the Ukrainian people, according to the ombudsman and Ukraine\u2019s military intelligence service. Since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022, the FSB has opened several regional offices in occupied Ukraine to recruit agents and gather intelligence. According to an official organizational chart published on its website, the FSB has directorates in the self-declared Donetsk and Luhansk People\u2019s Republics, in Crimea and in the occupied portions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. Several survivors in these locations told CNN that the Russians who submitted them to sexual violence either identified themselves or were referred to by others as FSB officers. Meanwhile, members of Rosgvardia, part of the Russian security apparatus that reports directly to Russian President Vladimir Putin, are working alongside the Russian military to detain activists, quash protests and spread terror among the civilian population in occupied areas. The SBU, Ukraine\u2019s security service, has managed to track down several Rosgvardia and FSB officials who it said were either the direct perpetrators or the enablers of sexual violence against people held in detention. The SBU and the Ukrainian regional prosecutor\u2019s office in Kherson have identified Aleksandr Naumenko, the deputy head of Rosgvardia in Russia\u2019s Rostov region, as a suspect in more than a dozen cases. Ukrainian authorities said last May he was responsible for overseeing a detention facility in Kherson during the occupation and that he personally ordered sexual torture of several victims who were electrocuted in their genital areas. The notice of suspicion against Naumenko, a legal document seen by CNN, alleges that his subordinates and other members of Russian armed forces acted directly on his orders when they sexually abused at least 17 victims. Two other Rosgvardia officers \u2013 Oleksandr Chilengirov and Yehor Bondarenkov \u2013 have also been\u00a0accused of torture, including electrocuting at least 24 victims in their genitals at a different detention facility in Kherson. Dmitry Laikov, an officer with the FSB\u2019s Department for the Defense of Constitutional Order and Fight against Terrorism, is accused of overseeing genital electrocution of a detained Ukrainian citizen in a police station in the occupied city of Nova Kakhovka. All four men have been indicted and their cases are currently being heard in court, according to Kherson prosecutors. Their whereabouts are unknown. Ukrainian officials say that it is difficult, but not impossible, to track down individual perpetrators of sexual violence crimes. As of early May, Ukrainian prosecutors had issued official notices of suspicion against 42 Russian officers, filed 19 indictments against 28 individuals and sentenced five people. All of the trials took place in absentia, according to the prosecutors\u2019 office. Sosonska told CNN a handful of cases are added to her file each month, and that investigations are progressing. However, none of the alleged perpetrators are in Ukrainian custody. Oleksii Butenko, a prosecutor in the Kherson regional prosecutor\u2019s office, said he has no doubt that sexual violence was part of Russia\u2019s strategy to subjugate the Ukrainian people in Kherson and to \u201cdestroy the Ukrainian national identity.\u201d \u201cWe can speak of a systematic approach \u2013 17 men were identified as having been sexually abused inside a single torture chamber,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cWe can say that the leadership, not only the perpetrators but also the management, is responsible \u2013 they gave permission or orders to commit these crimes.\u201d \u2018They were having fun\u2019 Andrii, a Kherson resident who was held in one of the Russian detention facilities, still remembers the screams of his fellow detainees more than a year and half after he was released. \u201cWe were kept in the basement of an office building. It was a small room with no furniture, we slept on cardboard and used a bucket to go to the toilet,\u201d Andrii said. Speaking to CNN in Kyiv, Andrii was clutching his hands nervously, looking away when describing what happened during his time in detention. He asked for his name to be changed and that no identifiable information about him be published. \u201cI was the last one to be taken in for interrogation, so I could hear them all being tortured in the next room. I couldn\u2019t hear the conversations, only the screams and the moans. It was impossible to sleep because of these screams,\u201d he said, recalling one particularly horrifying incident. \u201cI don\u2019t know who this man was and what happened to him \u2026 he was taken out into the corridor, where he was raped with a baton so that everyone could hear and see him.\u201d According to Andrii, the threats of rape and genital electrocution were the norm among the Russian forces. \u201cThey enjoyed it. They were having fun,\u201d he said. Ukrainian prosecutors have recorded incidents of Russian officials raping or attempting to rape victims using objects including batons, a pipe, a bottle, a handle of a shovel, a stick and a pen. Sosonska said her office is determined to bring to justice not just the direct perpetrators, but also those who were in charge \u2013 whether they ordered them or failed to prevent them. Her office is focused on prosecuting individuals, but it is also collecting evidence that will be shared with international courts, including the ICC, which prosecutes individuals over grave offenses such as genocide and war crimes, and the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which hears cases brought up against states. The ICC has already issued an arrest warrant for Putin and Russia\u2019s children\u2019s commissioner, Maria Lvova-Belova, over an alleged scheme to deport Ukrainian children to Russia. The Kremlin has denied the allegations and called the ICC\u2019s actions \u201coutrageous.\u201d Sosonska said she believes that, just like the child deportations, sexual violence is part of what she called \u201cRussia\u2019s genocidal campaign\u201d against Ukraine. \u2018It is happening now\u2019 Oleksii Sivak knew the Russians were coming for him after his neighbor Shapovalenko, the farm manager, was taken. The 39-year-old sailor from Kherson had helped him put up Ukrainian flags around their neighborhood on Ukrainian Independence Day. Both men were civilian volunteers. Shapovalenko had been distributing supplies, helping people evacuate and sharing information about the location of Russian troops with Ukrainian military acquaintances, while Sivak ran a soup kitchen, organizing assistance, distributing leaflets and putting up posters and flags. \u201cWe already knew about these torture rooms; we knew that people do not return from there. I went to deliver soup, warned the people I was helping, cut off all contacts and came home to wait for them,\u201d he said. Hiding or trying to go on the run was not an option, he added, saying he was aware Russian forces were targeting the relatives of people they were interested in. He said eight men came to arrest him \u2013 four in military uniforms and four wearing civilian clothes, all with their faces covered. They took him to a local police station and then handed him over to what they said was the FSB. He recalled being beaten and tortured with an electric current from the same kind of field telephone described as being used in other detention facilities. \u201cThey called it \u2018the lie detector\u2019 and they were obviously having fun when spinning the dynamo, asking me \u2018do you want to call Zelensky?\u2019\u201d he told CNN in an interview in Kyiv. \u201cFirst, they put the clamps on my ears and while they were shocking me, they were also beating me with a stick, kicking me, and hitting me with their hands \u2026 then they moved these wires from my ears to my genitals. They said, \u2018we\u2019re going to sterilize you now\u2019 and things like that, while they were electrocuting my genitals.\u201d Sivak believes he has a pretty good idea why the Russian troops chose to torture him in the way they did and threatened him with rape. \u201cThey wanted to humiliate me. It\u2019s obvious. What do you do to cause a man the most pain? You hurt his wife or his genitals,\u201d he said. Of the dozens of men he was held with, Sivak said roughly half were subjected to sexual violence. \u201cIt\u2019s a whole system. Four people (tortured me) but they were just the hatchet men. Yes, they have no brains, yes, they are animals, but even if they are imprisoned, what about their bosses? Someone was managing them; someone was giving them orders.\u201d Sivak said he and several other survivors have formed an informal support group and are trying to raise awareness of the fact that men can be victims of sexual violence. Sivak has attended meetings with government officials and conferences where he shared his experiences. Ukraine is prepared for a lengthy process to bring perpetrators to justice \u2013 while protecting the victims. Since the beginning of the full-scale war, Sosonska\u2019s prosecutors, as well as other civil servants and local government officials, have received specialized training on victim-oriented approaches, learning how to recognize conflict-related sexual violence, run investigations and communicate with victims. Some of the training programs have been provided by the UN in a direct response to the large number of sexual crimes occurring during the occupation. Others are run in cooperation with local non-governmental organizations and victim support groups. The UN has also co-sponsored a psychological helpline specifically aimed at male survivors. It can take years or even longer for courts to rule and victims to speak out. Some survivors of sexual violence committed by the Bosnian Serb army during the Bosnian war in the early 1990s are only now coming forward. \u201cSome survivors might be willing to testify within a few months, for some, it may never happen, they may never be ready,\u201d Sosonska said. As for Shapovalenko, he said he wanted everyone to know what happened to him \u2013 and what is still happening to others. \u201cI want to tell everyone, tell the international community, that it is not like they came, occupied us, stood there with machine guns and left. No, it wasn\u2019t like that,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the most terrible thing is not what I am telling you now. The most terrible thing is that it is happening now in the occupied territories.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/europe/russia-sexual-violence-occupied-ukraine-intl-cmd/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_02_style_aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl", "text": "Miami has a new addition to its skyline \u2013 a 66-story residential tower built by Aston Martin, marking the British luxury sports carmaker\u2019s first foray into the residential real estate market. Comprising of 391 units, Aston Martin Residences Miami sits at the mouth of the Miami River on Biscayne Bay, the firm said in a statement Tuesday. Designed in partnership with architect Rodolfo Miani of Bodas Mian Anger and built by G&G Business Developments, the 249-meter- (818-foot-) tall building houses seven penthouses, each with private pools and terraces, as well as apartments ranging in size from one to five bedrooms. The largest unit is the \u201cUnique Triplex Penthouse,\u201d arranged over three floors at the top of the building, which remains on the market for $59 million. The property was officially opened on Tuesday. Timed to coincide with the Formula One Miami Grand Prix, the company said in a statement that it marks \u201cthe latest distinct expression of Aston Martin\u2019s ultra-luxury high performance brand.\u201d Featuring an infinity pool with a pool deck, jacuzzis and cabanas on the 55th floor, the sail-shaped complex has a two-floor fitness center, two movie theaters and a virtual golf simulator. The building has a sky bar and lounge, chef\u2019s kitchen, ballroom and private dining areas, as well as a spa, beauty salon and barber shop. Direct access to the sea via a superyacht marina is also available, plus a private butler service. Germ\u00e1n Coto, chief executive officer of G&G Business Developments, told CNN Tuesday that the firm wanted to work on a project in the \u201ccosmopolitan city\u201d of Miami, and that this piece of land was the perfect choice. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing plot with an excellent view of the river,\u201d said Coto. The structure\u2019s aerodynamic shape helps the building deal with the technical challenges presented by high winds in the area, as well as evoking the sleek shape of an Aston Martin, according to Marek Reichman, executive vice president and chief creative officer of Aston Martin. It also becomes wider from the base to the mid-section before tightening once more towards the top, making it appear to bow out over people on street level, Reichman told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the drama,\u201d he added. Challenges However, the process wasn\u2019t all plain sailing. \u201cIt was difficult to achieve what we wanted because the space and the plot is kind of small,\u201d said Coto, with the building fitting into a 1.25-acre plot of land. Meanwhile, local building regulations imposed strict standards, explained Reichman, taking into account the low-lying land and propensity for flooding. \u201cThey were some of the most amazing challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to withstand the flooding with the windows that are on street level.\u201d There were further obstacles due to the curved shape of the building, which means that units on the east side have an individual architectural structural component. Aston Martin touches Homeowners are able to customize their interior space with the help of the Aston Martin design team, with three style packages \u2013 Timeless, Covert and Indulgent \u2013 drawing on the company\u2019s British heritage, as well as the building\u2019s context. \u201cIt needs to have part of the DNA of an Aston Martin,\u201d Reichman said. \u201cBut we are in Miami, you don\u2019t have a cold November evening where you need to put the log fire on, so you\u2019ve got to be considerate of the environment that you\u2019re in.\u201d Design elements running through the building include doors with bespoke Aston Martin handles, number plinths and kestrel tan leather door tabs. Aston Martin said that 99% of the properties sold before the building was completed. Residences were sold for $1.5 million to $8.5 million, while penthouses ranged from $16 million to $59 million. The Unique Triplex Penthouse, on the market for $59 million, comes with the last remaining Aston Martin Vulcan, an 820 brake horsepower all-carbon fiber supercar, of which only 24 exist, a spokesman for the company said. Meanwhile, buyers of the 47 Signature and Penthouse units were also able to choose between an Aston Martin DBX sports SUV or the company\u2019s DB11 sportscar.

{"id": "2024_05_29_tech_south-korea-samsung-union-strike-pay-negotiations-hnk-intl", "text": "A labor union representing tens of thousands of workers at Samsung Electronics in South Korea has called a one-day strike next week, in what would be the first such walkout at the smartphone and chipmaking giant. The Nationwide Samsung Electronics Union (NSEU) said on Wednesday during a press conference streamed on its official Youtube channel that its 28,000 members \u2014 just under a quarter of the company\u2019s total workforce in the country \u2014 would strike on June 7, following failed negotiations over pay and bonus arrangements. \u201cWe can no longer afford to see a company that has no will to negotiate,\u201d union representatives said, adding \u201cwe will fight for workers\u2019 rights and interests.\u201d Son Woomok, a union leader, told CNN that many NSEU members worked for Samsung\u2019s flagship semiconductor unit. \u201cWe are demanding transparent and fair performance bonuses and wage increases,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThere has never been a proper wage negotiation. It has always been carried out by announcing the (outcome) at the labor-management council, which does not include our union, and the company telling us to accept it,\u201d he added. In a statement to CNN, a Samsung spokesperson said: \u201cThe company remains committed to engaging in good faith negotiations with the union, and is making every sincere effort to come to an agreement.\u201d The world\u2019s biggest memory chipmaker has had a rough few years. A historic shortage\u00a0of computer chips during the Covid pandemic was followed by falling demand last year as consumer appetite for electronics remained weak because of global economic uncertainty. In January, Samsung reported an operating profit of just 6.567 trillion won ($4.8 billion) for 2023, its weakest annual performance since 2009, according to the Wall Street Journal. Samsung also lost its crown as the top smartphone maker globally. But things are looking up for the company because of  the AI boom. It is optimistic about a resurgence in demand for mobile devices this year, particularly with the rollout of new products, such as AI-powered smartphones. Last month, Samsung reported a more than 10-fold rise in first-quarter operating profit amid forecasts of high demand for AI and high-end chips, an area in which it competes with Intel (INTC) and Taiwan\u2019s TSMC. The vast majority of the world\u2019s advanced microchips are made in just two places: Taiwan and South Korea. Taiwan\u2019s industry is larger and more dominant, something South Korea is keen to challenge.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/tech/south-korea-samsung-union-strike-pay-negotiations-hnk-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_01_sport_champions-league-final-borussia-dortmund-real-madrid-spt-intl", "text": "Few teams have faced down Real Madrid in a Champions League final with as much conviction as Borussia Dortmund displayed at Wembley Stadium on Saturday night. In the end, however, the result was the same as it always is. Despite suffering and defending for the vast majority of the final, clinging on for dear life at times, Real Madrid will leave London with a record-extending 15th European Cup after late goals from Dani Carvajal and Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior earned Los Blancos a 2-0 win and broke Dortmund hearts. It was a particularly cruel end for Dortmund defender Ian Maatsen, who needlessly gave away the corner for Carvajal\u2019s header before gifting Real possession for Vin\u00edcius\u2019 goal just minutes later. After a night of mostly toil, it was once again Real celebrating at the full-time whistle in a Champions League final, the fans in a wall of white serenading their unbeatable team. Not since losing 1-0 to Liverpool in 1981 has Real\u00a0been defeated in a European Cup final, now a run of nine successive victories that have spanned 43 years and taken the club\u2019s total tally to 15 \u2013 more than twice the amount second-placed AC Milan have racked up. Dortmund rues missed chances The mood inside the stadium was decidedly different ahead of kick off. The famous \u2018Yellow Wall\u2019 was in fine voice almost an hour before the start of the game, transplanted brick by brick, fan by fan from Dortmund to Wembley without missing a beat. Sensing the Real Madrid end was being outsung by the Dortmund fans, Vin\u00edcius gave an early fist pump towards those supporters in white to coax a booming roar from them. That burst aside, however, it was the Dortmund fans making all of the noise inside the opening 10 minutes; their relentless, deafening chants filling the gloomy London sky above Wembley Stadium. There must be few sights in football more daunting than lining up against Real Madrid in a Champions League final. But Dortmund was brave early on. Edin Terzi\u0107\u2019s side fearlessly passed the ball out from the back, though a couple of particularly risky balls almost gifted Real possession. It was the team\u2019s slick passing that created the first real chance of the final, but Julian Brandt got the ball caught under his feet and skewed his shot horribly wide with only Thibaut Courtois to beat in the box. That move sparked a flurry of gilt-edged chances for Dortmund. Niclas F\u00fcllkrug had a close-range header saved and an effort that hit the post and rolled agnozingly across the goalline, while Karim Adeyemi had two glorious one-on-one opportunities but failed to convert either. Real Madrid shows invincibility Over the years, Real has developed an unerring knack for producing improbable comebacks in the Champions League. Defender Nacho once said the team possessed \u201cmagic\u201d on European nights like these but tonight felt as though there was some supernatural force preventing Dortmund from scoring. The missed chances did nothing to dampen the spirits of Dortmund fans, however, almost 40,000 of them jumping in unison to shake Wembley\u2019s foundations. It was an utterly dominant first half from Dortmund, the team paying no heed to Real\u2019s remarkable record and aura of invincibility in this competition. The Dortmund players were met with a deafening roar of approval when the referee blew for half time. Real fans, however, were stood in stunned silence. As they had been for much of the first half. The team not only looked rattled defensively but utterly toothless going forward, each attack snuffed out comfortably by Dortmund\u2019s defense. It is truly an unusual sight to see Real floundering so badly in the Champions League, though there remained an overwhelming sense that Dortmund would eventually be left to rue all of those missed chances. There were some early signs of life from the men in white early in the second half - Toni Kroos\u2019 free-kick being kept out in stunning fashion by Gregor Kobel - but back Dortmund came. The team continued to dominate inside the opening 20 minutes and F\u00fcllkrug had another glorious opportunity saved by Courtois. The Belgian stopper produced one of the all time great performances in a Champions League final when Real beat Liverpool two years ago, and he was at his best again after only returning from injury in time for the game. Then the inevitable happened. First through Carvajal\u2019s header and then when Maatsen passed the ball straight to Bellingham, allowing the Englishman to find Vin\u00edcius who dinked the ball over Kobel. Even with hope totally fading as the remaining seconds of stoppage time wore on - and faced by thousands of jumping, exuberant Real fans - Dortmund supporters defiantly held up their scarves and continued to sing. They thought they were finally given a moment to belatedly celebrate when F\u00fcllkrug found the back of the net, but they weren\u2019t even afforded that as the goal was ruled out for offside. \u201cCampeones, campeones ol\u00e9, ol\u00e9, ol\u00e9,\u201d came the chant from Real supprters as Carvajal waited to hoist the trophy above his head. It will be a sleepless night for both sets of players and fans, but for very different reasons.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/01/sport/champions-league-final-borussia-dortmund-real-madrid-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "world"}}

More than 280,000 utility customers in Texas were without power as of Wednesday evening, including more than 150,000 in Dallas County alone, according to PowerOutage.us. Both Houston and Dallas were slammed with hurricane-force winds Tuesday as violent storms flooded roads, upended trees and power lines and reduces some buildings to shells of their former selves. The winds collapsed an under-construction home in Magnolia, Texas, killing a 16-year-old working inside of it, according to the Montgomery County Sheriff\u2019s Office. At least eight people have been killed in the state since Saturday as severe weather pummeled the region over Memorial Day weekend. The violent weather is just the latest in an unrelenting series of severe storms that has battered Texas in recent weeks, leaving residents with little time to recover from one storm before the next arrives at their doorstep. Summerlike heat will ease across Texas this week following a sweltering heat wave, but those left without power or a reliable way to cool down could still face the risk of dangerous heat stroke or heat exhaustion. Temperatures across eastern Texas on Wednesday will hover around the mid-80s to low 90s, according to the National Weather Service. Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins warned people to prepare to be without power for days as an area utility company reported extensive damage to its infrastructure. The utility, Oncor, shared photos of mangled electricity poles, twisted power lines and massive toppled trees. Widespread outages also hampered primary runoff elections on Tuesday in Dallas County, as more than a third of polling locations were in the dark, according to Jenkins. \u201cCheck on your friends, family, and neighbors, especially anyone elderly,\u201d Dallas County officials advised. \u201cDon\u2019t move debris yet as there could be hidden downed power lines that could still be energized.\u201d Esmeralda Martinez, who lives in the Dallas suburb of Carrollton, is among those now sifting through homes that were reduced to piles of soggy debris and jagged wooden beams, CNN affiliate WFAA reports. She and her family sheltered in a hallway as the storm tore off the roof, damaging every room in her home and soaking their belongings. Across the street, Javon Holloway and his grandmother are grateful their home was spared from more serious damage. The neighbors are thankful no one was harmed. \u201cDon\u2019t take your house for granted. I\u2019ll say that much. Be thankful for what you got,\u201d Holloway told WFAA. Storms continued moving across north and central Texas on Tuesday night and are expected to last through Wednesday morning, the National Weather Service in Fort Worth said. After a brief reprieve, another round of powerful storms will rumble back into the same area Thursday evening, bringing a threat of large hail, damaging winds and localized flooding to the Dallas-Fort Worth area. Houston faces damage d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu Houston-area residents are facing an all-too-familar feeling as they survey the fresh layer of damage left by Tuesday\u2019s storms \u2013 just two weeks after a derecho and a tornado bulldozed through the city, killing multiple people and knocking out power for nearly 1 million homes and businesses. Though 99% of those outages had been restored as of last week, more than 300,000 homes and businesses in the Houston area lost power in Tuesday\u2019s storms, according to the regional utility CenterPoint Energy. A majority of its customers had power restored by Wednesday morning. The latest severe weather also thwarted some of the city\u2019s ongoing recovery after the mid-May storm covered streets with trees and debris, shattered skyscraper windows and damaged buildings. That damage had not yet been fully repaired when Tuesday\u2019s storms tore through, rescattering piles of debris that crews had been collecting off the streets and sending another shower of broken window glass onto Downtown Houston, according to CNN affiliates KTRK and KHOU.

{"id": "2024_05_30_europe_spanish-parliament-amnesty-law-catalan-intl", "text": "The Spanish parliament has approved a controversial amnesty law that paves the way for hundreds of people facing prosecution for their roles in the failed independence bid in Catalonia to be pardoned. The Socialist Party of Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez put forward the amnesty last year as a way of securing the support of Catalan separatist parties after inconclusive elections. The government has portrayed the bill as a way of moving on from the crisis of 2017, when separatist leaders attempted to push forward with Catalan secession with a referendum ruled illegal by Spain\u2019s Constitutional Court and followed it up by declaring independence. The bill has infuriated Spain\u2019s right, triggering large protests. But it passed by 177 votes in favor to 172 against, helped by crucial support from two Catalan separatist parties, Junts (Together) and Esquerra Republicana (Republican Left). After the vote, Sanchez said in a social media post that \u201cin politics, as in life, forgiveness is more powerful than resentment.\u201d Spain\u2019s main opposition conservative Popular Party and the far-right Vox party voted against the measure. Just before the vote, the Madrid regional government president Isabel Diaz Ayuso, of the Popular Party, vowed to appeal against the new law to Spain\u2019s Constitutional Court, the highest in the land. Spain\u2019s amnesty law would benefit 309 people facing prosecution for their roles in the failed Catalan independence bid, including political leaders. In addition to them, 73 police officers would be covered by the amnesty\u00a0after they faced charges for their actions while trying to defend the law and the Constitution, a government source at the prime minister\u2019s compound told CNN last November. The amnesty law would also allow exiled independence leader Carles Puigdemont, of the Junts party, to return to Spain, as he would no longer face judicial charges. In addition, Oriol Junqueras, of the Catalan separatist Esquerra Republicana party, would no longer be barred from holding public office, a government source told CNN last November. Puigdemont is a former president of the Catalan regional government who fled to Belgium in October 2017 after the failed independence bid. He participated in talks with a top S\u00e1nchez aide\u00a0in Belgium last November to secure the votes of his Junts party\u2019s seven seats in Spanish parliament for Sanchez\u2019s investiture. Oriol Junqueras is a former vice president of the Catalan regional government who was arrested in Spain\u00a0in November 2017 and later sentenced to 13 years in prison for his role in the independence attempt, the Esquerra Republicana party\u2019s website says. Junqueras\u00a0was pardoned in 2021 by S\u00e1nchez\u2019s Socialist government, along with some other jailed independence leaders. The Esquerra Republicana party\u2019s seven seats in Spanish parliament also voted for Sanchez\u2019s investiture last November. S\u00e1nchez\u00a0and Socialist leaders have said the amnesty law would help close the conflict in the sharply divided Catalan society and pave a way forward for the wealthy region in northeastern Spain. But leaders of the conservative Popular Party, Alberto Nu\u00f1ez Feijoo, and the Vox party, Santiago Abascal, both criticized the government\u2019s move, calling it \u201cpolitical corruption,\u201d in their respective speeches in parliament Thursday against the law. They said it amounted to a deal for Sanchez to stay in power\u00a0in exchange for concessions to the Catalan separatists. The legislation will take effect when it\u2019s published \u201cin the coming days\u201d in the Official State Bulletin, Felix Bola\u00f1os, Minister of Justice and a top aide to Sanchez, told reporters at parliament after the vote. Asked about the planned appeal by the conservative Madrid regional government against the new law, Bola\u00f1os said that Spain \u201cis a state of law that guarantees the right of appeal.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/europe/spanish-parliament-amnesty-law-catalan-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "world"}}

Its consistent wind makes it a hotspot for kitesurfing enthusiasts, but a new port, currently halfway through construction, could turn the area into a gateway for trade. The $1.2 billion megaproject is expected to complete in 2028. Spanning 1,650 hectares, the complex will include a trade port with an oil terminal, a fishing port and a shipyard. There will be a bridge linking the port to the land and a 7-kilometer road that connects the port with a national highway that runs along the coast as far north as Tangier and as far south as the border with Mauritania. \u201cWe\u2019re constructing an ecosystem,\u201d Nisrine Iouzzi, the director of construction for the Dakhla Atlantic Port, tells CNN. Once operational, she expects the port to handle 35 million tons of goods a year. This will not only boost Morocco\u2019s economy, she says, but it could help the country become a maritime hub for worldwide trade, connecting regions such as West Africa, the Middle East, Europe, North America, the Canary Islands and even South America. \u201cThe geographic location is key (to) the success of the port,\u201d she says, adding that the project has attracted significant foreign investment, including from the United Arab Emirates. Gateway to Africa The project is part of Morocco\u2019s national port strategy, which aims to modernize and strengthen port infrastructure by 2030, in order to enhance its role in global supply chains. Seaports such as Casablanca, Tanger-Med and Agadir have already been or are being upgraded, but because of its location, the Dakhla port is seen as particularly significant in opening up\u00a0other parts of the African continent for the world to trade with. \u201cWe strongly believe that with this infrastructure \u2013 port infrastructure, road infrastructure, renewable energy \u2013 we will be very attractive for investors that aim to get to one of the fastest growing markets, which is the West African market,\u201d says Mounir Houari, general manager of Dakhla\u2019s Regional Investment Center. With the implementation of Africa\u2019s continental free trade agreement, which aims to create a single market for goods and services, the port could encourage the processing of raw materials within the continent. \u201cLess than 5% of African natural resources are processed in Africa because there is no industrial infrastructure and exporting infrastructure,\u201d says Houari. The Dakhla port \u201cwill encourage many Africans to start processing natural resources in Africa, allowing African countries to create more jobs to improve their skills and know-how and strengthen their own industries.\u201d The Sahel region, especially landlocked countries such as Mali, Chad, Niger and Burkina Faso, are expected to benefit. Houari explains that Morocco has granted the region access to its road and port infrastructure, providing \u201ca door to the Atlantic maritime trade.\u201d Turloch Mooney, head of port intelligence and analytics at research firm S&P Global Market Intelligence, says the development could be beneficial to the region. \u201cIt is very positive to see modern port and trade infrastructure being developed in the Western Sahara where there is potential to support a large hinterland in West Africa and the Sahel,\u201d he says. \u201cQuality port infrastructure and efficient port operations is part of the package of assurance for foreign direct investment and has been a key factor in the successful growth strategies of many developing countries.\u201d But Western Sahara and the Sahel region has a long history of unrest. \u201cLocal disputes can make developing port infrastructure and reliable logistics much more challenging,\u201d says Mooney.

{"id": "2024_05_28_middleeast_spain-ireland-norway-recognize-palestinian-statehood-intl", "text": "Spain, Ireland and Norway formally recognized Palestinian statehood on Tuesday, cementing a joint move that further isolates Israel over its war against Hamas in Gaza. Irish Prime Minister Simon Harris said his country made the decision, which was strongly condemned by Israel, \u201cto keep the miracle of peace alive.\u201d The nations had announced they would take this step last week, but on Tuesday their respective governments simultaneously approved the declaration, meaning it has now officially come into effect. The move also highlights just how split Europe is on whether to recognize Palestinian statehood. A majority of countries around the world do so, and reaffirmed that stance this month in a United Nations resolution in support of Palestinian membership that passed with the support of 143 nations. Among them were many European states. But it is difficult to be truly definitive about how many countries view the issue; some former Eastern bloc countries, for example, recognized Palestinian statehood decades ago while under Soviet rule, but have since distanced themselves from that stance as independent countries. Spain, Ireland and Norway The move by these three countries to recognize Palestinian statehood in tandem sent an impactful message to Israel, and other Western states. Harris said in a statement on Tuesday that Ireland \u201chad wanted to recognise Palestine at the end of a peace process,\u201d but ultimately \u201cmade this move alongside Spain and Norway to keep the miracle of peace alive\u201d \u2013 underlining how the joint declaration gave each nation some level of cover, and may have accelerated the process. \u201cI again call on Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel to listen to the world and stop the humanitarian catastrophe we are seeing in Gaza,\u201d Harris said. \u201cIt is regrettable that the Israeli government shows no signs of engaging constructively,\u201d the Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide added as his country formalized the move on Tuesday. \u201cThe international community must increase its political and economic support for Palestine and continue the work for a two-state solution.\u201d In Madrid, Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez said in a nationally televised address that Spain would join \u201cmore than 140 countries that already recognize Palestine\u201d and that it \u201cis the only way to realize the solution that we all recognize as the only possible one to achieve a future of peace: that of a Palestinian state that coexists alongside the state of Israel in peace and security.\u201d But all three countries have received a furious response from Israel since announcing their decision last week. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz ordered the immediate recall of its ambassadors to the trio, and said in a statement: \u201cI am sending a clear message today \u2013 Israel will not hold back against those who undermine its sovereignty and endanger its security.\u201d \u201cAfter the terrorist organization Hamas carried out the largest massacre of Jews since the Holocaust, after it committed the most horrific sex crimes the world has seen, these countries chose to give a reward to Hamas and Iran and recognize a Palestinian state,\u201d Katz added. Western Europe In 2014, Sweden became the first major Western European nation to recognize Palestinian statehood. Swedish Foreign Minister Margot Wallstrom said the decision was made because it \u201cmet the criteria of international law.\u201d \u201cIn the light of the international law analysis, we see no reason to delay this decision,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is a territory of people and a government. Not to recognize Palestine because of the occupation would be against the principle of international law about no fruits of aggression.\u201d But that move did not lead to a groundswell of Western European support for the declaration. Instead, some countries have inched towards supporting Palestinian statehood as part of their wider advocacy for a two-state solution, but have not yet taken the step of formal recognition. Notably, France, Belgium, Poland and Greece voted in favor of the May 10 UN General Assembly resolution that called for Palestinian membership of the UN earlier this month. Denmark was also among the countries that voted \u201cYes.\u201d But on Tuesday, as its neighbor Norway formalized its recognition, Denmark\u2019s parliament voted down a proposal to do so, Reuters reported. Other countries \u2013 including the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands \u2013 abstained from the UN vote, which was significant but ultimately symbolic given the United States\u2019 veto. In total, 143 votes were passed in favor of the UN resolution, 25 nations abstained and nine voted against. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz\u00a0said Friday that the time for a German recognition had not yet come, as there is \u201cno clarity on the territory of the state.\u201d For now, it\u2019s about achieving a long-term ceasefire,\u201d Scholz said. \u201cThe path of symbolic recognition of\u00a0statehood\u00a0is not the way forward.\u201d Eastern Europe Officially, a number of countries that previously fell under the Soviet sphere of influence in eastern Europe recognize Palestinian statehood. Hungary, the Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria all take that stance, Reuters reported on Tuesday. But in eastern Europe, that recognition is often complicated, given that the order to formalize ties was given under a Soviet regime that sought to disrupt American global partnerships, such as that with Israel. Some former Soviet-bloc countries, such as Poland, have maintained close ties with Palestinian authorities, and have visited or hosted leaders from the Palestinian Authority in Ramallah. Others have since distanced themselves from their historical declaration of support for Palestinian statehood, such as the Czech Republic, which was one of just nine countries to vote against the UNGA resolution earlier this month. The other nations were Hungary, Argentina, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Israel and the United States. Slovenia\u2019s government will consider a proposal this week to recognize an independent Palestinian state, according to Prime Minister Robert Golob. Golob said in a statement that \u201cafter a series of consultations over the last few days,\u201d a government meeting on Thursday will consider forwarding \u201cthe recognition of Palestine\u201d to the country\u2019s legislature for approval.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/middleeast/spain-ireland-norway-recognize-palestinian-statehood-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "weather_us-leads-tornado-numbers-tornado-alley-xpn", "text": "The US averages over 1,150 tornadoes every year. That\u2019s more than any other country. In fact, it\u2019s more than Canada, Australia and all European countries combined.  Within the US, every state has had at least one tornado, and some have dozens each year.  The US is special in terms of producing so many tornadoes, especially violent ones. In the US, the average number of tornado fatalities per year is 73. But in Europe, where the tornadoes are usually much weaker, the fatalities are estimated to be between 10 and 15 annually. Some states are deadlier than others Texas on average has 140 tornadoes every year \u2013 the most of any state. Kansas, Florida, Oklahoma, and Nebraska round out the top five. But the total number of tornadoes does not always tell the whole story. For example, despite Alabama having on average 42 tornadoes per year \u2013 more than three times fewer than Texas \u2013 it is at the top of the list for tornado fatalities. Alabama averages 14 tornado fatalities per year, almost double the next highest \u2013 Missouri with eight deaths per year. The time of day and the topography where the tornado occurs makes a big difference in the fatality rate. The topography in Alabama and other Southern states often includes rolling hills, plateaus, and many more trees than the Plains states like Kansas, Texas, and Nebraska, where a tornado often can be seen from miles away. The more likely a tornado can be seen often leads to the tornado being reported faster, allowing more time for people to be warned and seek shelter. Southern states such as Tennessee, Kentucky and  Arkansas also see more tornadoes overnight versus any other state. This can lead to higher fatalities, since many people are sleeping and unaware that a tornado is approaching.  \u201cTornadoes in the Southeast tend to be more dangerous than their Great Plains counterparts,\u201d says Brandon Miller, CNN Meteorologist.  \u201cThere are a number of reasons for this, some weather and some geographic. Southeastern tornadoes often travel faster, moved by a faster jet stream.\u201d  All of these factors can lead to higher fatality rate in Southern states compared to the Plains. But all of these states have a few things in common: the ideal atmospheric conditions for tornadoes to form. \u201cThe basic ingredients for severe thunderstorms that can make tornadoes are warm, moist air near the ground, relatively dry, cool air aloft (about 10,000 to 30,000 feet), and horizontal winds in the environment the storm forms in that increase as you go from the ground up and change direction with height, blowing from the equator near the ground and from the west aloft,\u201d says Dr. Harold Brooks, senior scientist with the NOAA National Severe Storms Laboratory. Low pressure systems in the US pull warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico and cool, dry air aloft from the Rocky Mountains or the High Desert in the southwest. The states that fall in between those two regions end up being in the ideal location for severe weather to ignite.  \u201cNo place else in the world has the large warm water on its equatorward side with a wide high range of mountains extending from north to south to the west of it,\u201d Dr. Brooks said. \u201cAll the other tornado prone regions have at least one feature suboptimal.\u201d  The US leads every other country for tornadoes Other countries experience tornadoes, including Germany, Australia, South Africa, eastern China, Japan, Bangladesh, Argentina, and more. Europe as a whole is comparable to the size of the US, but there is a vast difference in number of tornadoes and tornado fatalities.  From 2011 to 2020, the US averaged a preliminary total of 1,173 tornadoes per year, and Europe around 256. However, Dr. Pieter Groenemeijer, Director of the European Severe Storms Laboratory (ESSL), cautions that the European number may be on the low side. \u201cWeaker tornadoes are likely still under-reported in some countries, such as France and the UK,\u201d Groenemeijer says. European Russia (which is the part of the country west of 58 degrees East longitude), tops the list at 86 tornadoes annually. Germany comes in second with an average 28 tornadoes annually. The peak density of tornado reports coincides with the high population density over Belgium, the Netherlands, and northern Germany, according to a study on severe storms in Europe published in December 2020. The study also reports that thunderstorms are twice as frequent over the United States, with as many as four times more storm reports, compared to Europe. One thing most countries have in common is the time of day that tornadoes occur, which is most frequently during the afternoon and early evening. But the peak season is not the same. In the US, spring is the peak for tornado activity. For central and northern Europe the main tornado season is in summer, whereas it is autumn for the western and central Mediterranean region, and winter in the eastern Mediterranean. Outside of the US, Canada actually ranks second on the list for most tornadoes, with an average of 100 per year. Tornadoes are not limited to the Northern Hemisphere. Australia has dozens every year, and South Africa also reports annual occurrences. South America, much like other continents, has its own tornado hotspot, known as \u201cpasillo de los tornados.\u201d This tornado corridor includes Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, and a portion of Brazil.  According to the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research in New Zealand, tornadoes are relatively rare there. On average, around seven to 10 moderate to strong tornado events are reported in New Zealand every year. Southern Hemisphere tornadoes typically rotate clockwise, which is the opposite of how tornadoes primarily spin in the Northern Hemisphere.

Hawaiian Electric says\u00a0on its website\u00a0that \u201ca best-case scenario\u201d would allow them to give people 24-48 hours\u2019 notice before a shutdown.\u00a0According to the public notice,\u00a0residents would be notified of a potential shutoff through news releases, social media, outage maps or the Hawaiian Electric website. If weather changes suddenly, then a shutoff may occur with little or no notice. High wind and red flag warnings were issued by the National Weather Service on August 8, the day of the devastating Maui wildfires. But during the disaster,\u00a0the community\u2019s siren warning system did not sound.

Maui County\u2019s top emergency management official\u00a0resigned\u00a0days after defending the siren\u2019s silence, citing health reasons. Maui\u2019s government filed a lawsuit in August accusing Hawaiian Electric of causing the wildfires. The lawsuit alleged the electric company\u00a0\u201cinexcusably kept their power lines energized,\u201d despite the National Weather Service\u2019s warning that winds could knock down power lines and cause fires. The utility announced Wednesday it designated\u00a0high-risk areas\u00a0in three of the state\u2019s counties \u2013 including parts of the west coast of Oahu, its most populous island \u2013 where emergency power shutoffs are authorized in a weather emergency.

{"id": "2024_05_31_americas_mexico-elections-us-relationship-analysis-intl-latam", "text": "With more than 98 million eligible voters, some 70,000 candidates and over 20,000 public offices being contested, Mexico\u2019s general election on June 2 will be the largest in the country\u2019s history. But it\u2019s not just the massive scale of the event that makes it so important in the eyes of observers across the border in the United States. For the first time in history, the country looks set to elect its first female president. The two front-runners are both women \u2013 Claudia Sheinbaum, of the Morena party, who is backed by the governing coalition Sigamos Haciendo Historia, and X\u00f3chitl G\u00e1lvez, who is backed by an coalition of opposition parties. The vote is also important because it falls in the same year as the US presidential election \u2013 something that happens only once every 12 years \u2013 and comes at a time of transition in the relationship between the two countries. \u201cThe years when all the US wanted was a safe and stable Mexico are over. Now it is also interested in a country with good public policy,\u201d said Rafael Fern\u00e1ndez de Castro Medina, director of the Center for US-Mexico Studies at the University of California, San Diego, pointing to the increasing number of Latinos in the US and the two countries\u2019 growing ties. Here are a look at some of the biggest issues affecting the US-Mexico relationship that will be influenced by Sunday\u2019s vote: It\u2019s the economy, stupid Mexico became the United States\u2019 top trading partner last year, surpassing China and Canada. Experts say this is largely because geopolitical issues such as the pandemic, the legacy of  Trump\u2019s trade war against China, and the war in Ukraine all encouraged near-shoring \u2013 the relocation of supply chains nearer to home \u2013 which boosted US imports from Mexico and its investment in the country. Key to facilitating this shift was the creation of the USMCA trade agreement, which came into effect in 2020 between Mexico, the United States and Canada. \u201cThe USMCA offered, in that favorable context, a legal regulatory framework that provided a lot of certainty to the three North American countries, and Mexico has seized the opportunities and strengthened its preferential tariffs to make this happen,\u201d explained Lila Abed, director of the Mexico Institute at the Wilson Center. However, it\u2019s not all been plain sailing. Mexico\u2019s compliance with the USMCA has been an issue of contention between the administration of Mexico\u2019s current President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador and those of both US President Joe Biden and his predecessor Donald Trump. \u201cThe next president of Mexico will have to deal with a series of legal disputes that the United States, supported by Canada, has filed within the framework of the USMCA,\u201d Abed points out. \u201cThese range from [L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s] ban on the import of transgenic corn for human consumption; the shift towards a nationalist energy policy, which has affected US investments in electricity and hydrocarbons, as well as the little importance given to clean energies,\u201d Abed said. According to Abed, whoever wins the Mexican presidency on June 2 will have to deal with a lawsuit filed by the United States on these issues. They will also have to renegotiate the agreement when it comes up for renewal in 2026. Many analysts believe the US is currently playing down disputes over the USMCA in the hope that this can ease differences in other areas, both in domestic Mexican issues \u2013 such as alleged human rights violations, the government\u2019s treatment of journalists, and the increase in political assassinations \u2013 and bilateral concerns such as immigration and the drug trade. \u201cIt\u2019s very transactional. Mexico agreed to partially manage the immigration crisis in the US, keeping immigrants in Mexican territory and taking care of their deportation, in exchange for the United States not activating these lawsuits,\u201d said Raquel L\u00f3pez Portillo Maltos, executive secretary of the youth group of the Mexican Council on Foreign Relations (Comexi) think tank. Jorge Alberto Schiavon Uriegas, vice president of the Center for Studies and Analysis on Mexico\u2019s Foreign Policy, said L\u00f3pez Obrador followed a quid pro quo policy towards both Trump and Biden, and this would possibly continue with Sheinbaum, if elected. \u201cMexico committed to addressing the two main Mexican issues affecting the United States and that will determine the next election: migration and fentanyl. In exchange, the United States dramatically reduced its criticism of Mexico\u2019s democratic and institutional weakness, and reduced its interventions, leaving more room for L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s domestic policy,\u201d said Schiavon Uriegas. Migration: Mexico, \u2018part of Trump\u2019s wall\u2019 While migration across the countries\u2019 1,933 miles long border is a shared concern, the issue is much lower on Mexican politicians\u2019 agenda than in the US \u2014 where it could be a decisive factor in the November vote, according to Carin Zissis, editor-in-chief of the Americas Society/Council of the Americas website. \u201cThe speeches of Sheinbaum and G\u00e1lvez on migration are neither very strong nor very different from each other, nor do they address too much what to do with migrants in the country,\u201d she said. \u201cProof of this is that, during the last presidential debate, when migration was addressed, the main angle was Mexican migrants currently living in the US; they were talking to their potential voters north of the border and to the Latino community in general, which is large and powerful due to remittances.\u201d The rub for US politicians is that they need buy-in from their Mexican counterparts if their own immigration policies are to succeed. Zissis gave the example of how Lopez Obrador had made Mexico \u201cpart of Trump\u2019s wall\u201d by sending \u201cthousands of members of the National Guard and the Army to take care of migration control.\u201d \u00a8Trump didn\u2019t have to build the wall because Mexico is the wall,\u201d said Zissis. Abed, of the Mexico Institute, said Mexico\u2019s next president would face a different conundrum to previous leaders, because the country had changed from being merely a transit country, which immigrants passed through on their way to the US, to being in many cases their final stop. \u201cThe reaction of the L\u00f3pez Obrador government has been to transport migrants who are waiting at the border between Mexico and the United States to the southeast of the country and leave them there. The migration authorities are overwhelmed, the Mexican Refugee Aid Commission (Comar) is also overwhelmed, the centers where migrants stay are very precarious, migrants \u2014 specifically unaccompanied minors and women, as well as young people \u2014 are at risk from organized crime and human traffickers, and their human rights could be violated,\u201d Abed detailed. She said the next Mexican government will need to assume responsibility for this large migrant population, \u201cand decide whether to give them a temporary visa, whether to allow them to work, whether they will have access to medical services, etc.\u201d Fentanyl and the drug trade Security is another pillar of the bilateral relationship, particularly in terms of the thriving cross-border drug trade that blights both countries. While the United States has been grappling with a domestic health crisis due to the amount of fentanyl on its streets, Mexico faces increasing cartel-linked violence \u2013 including in the run-up to the election which has been marred by dozens of assassination attempts and other political violence. \u201cM\u00e9xico has made progress in dismantling clandestine drug laboratories, but the next government must do more to stop the entry through maritime ports of precursor chemicals mostly coming from China, because after that is when they fall into the hands of organized crime to produce these synthetic opioids,\u201d Abed said. \u201cBut the United States also has to dismantle the network of traffickers within (its own borders). That is, once fentanyl arrives, its distribution throughout the territory is not magical. There is a significant network of organized crime in the United States that the administration must arrest, bring to trial, and whose activities it must restrict,\u201d she added. One issue the US may be keen to revisit with whoever wins on June 2 are the reforms to Mexico\u2019s National Security Law that the L\u00f3pez Obrador government implemented in 2018 as one of its first measures, which limited the activity of foreign agents operating on Mexican territory. \u201cIt was a symbol, a sign that the Mexican government was not going to open the door so easily to security agencies such as the DEA, the CIA, and others. He removed the diplomatic immunity (and) they had to register all their activities with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, etc,\u201d explained Abed. Experts who spoke to CNN said, however, that much of L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s confrontational discourse with the United States was a facade that, at times, hid a well-oiled process of negotiations with both the Republican and Democratic administrations. \u201cL\u00f3pez Obrador often speaks to his Mexican base and then negotiates. He knows that the US needs him on migration and security matters,\u201d said Zissis at the Americas Society website.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/americas/mexico-elections-us-relationship-analysis-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "world"}}

Staff at a public library in Helsinki were rather surprised when a copy of Arthur Conan Doyle\u2019s \u201cThe Refugees\u201d was returned to them more than eight decades after its due date. The novel, which is a Finnish translation of the English original, was received at Helsinki Central Library Oodi\u2019s lobby on Monday - more than 84 years after its due date of December 26, 1939. The returned book contained the borrower\u2019s library card, leading staff to believe that the original patron who took out the book was a businessman from the Pursimiehenkatu area of the Finnish capital. Librarian Heini Strand, who received the book at the library, told CNN in an email Friday: \u201cThe one who returned the book didn\u2019t tell - and we didn\u2019t ask - what was their relation to the one who originally loaned the book.\u201d Strand added: \u201cWe get these kinds of returnings that are tens of years late every once in a while, and many times they are books that friends and family find when they go through the belongings of a deceased relative. I don\u2019t know if this was the case with this book.\u201d The timing of the due date could be crucial in trying to explain why the book was never returned - the Soviet Union attacked Finland on November 30, 1939. Strand said: \u201cThe winter war had started just a month before the due date, so probably returning of a library loan wasn\u2019t the first thing on the loaners mind at the due date.\u201d The copy was in reasonably good shape considering its age and may now return to circulation for public borrowing. Strand said that the library already has two copies of the book in its collection, adding: \u201cWe sent the book to the book storage of Helsinki city library\u2019s main library which is in Pasila. \u201cThe people working there can decide whether to take it in to the collection or not. If it\u2019s taken in, then library customers can reserve it online and loan the book.\u201d The maximum penalty for an overdue book at the Helsinki library is \u20ac6 ($6.50) but no fine is being levied as the book was no longer in the library\u2019s system, which had changed many times since it was initially borrowed. Siina Tiuraniemi, a librarian colleague of Strand, told CNN: \u201cOur purpose is not to guard the books, we are here to promote reading and enable access to books and knowledge to everyone. The library is a very humane place, and people in Finland use the libraries a lot and understand how they work. Library books belong to all of us and late returns are not a big problem.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/travel/library-book-1939-late-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_31_asia_us-defense-chief-austin-shangrila-intl-hnk", "text": "US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Saturday hailed the arrival of a \u201cnew convergence\u201d in the Indo-Pacific, as the United States fortifies\u00a0strategic and security partnerships in the region amid rising threats from China and Russia. \u201cToday, we are witnessing a new convergence around nearly all aspects of security in the Indo-Pacific,\u201d Austin said at the Shangri-La Dialogue security forum in Singapore. \u201cThis new convergence is producing a stronger, more resilient, and more capable network of partnerships. And that is defining a new era of security in the Indo-Pacific.\u201d The new convergence is not \u201ca single alliance or coalition,\u201d but instead \u201ca set of overlapping and complementary initiatives and institutions, propelled by both a shared vision and a shared sense of mutual obligation,\u201d Austin said. Looming large in that regional vision is a more assertive China, which Austin alluded to without mentioning it by name. The convergence, he said, is not about \u201cimposing one country\u2019s will\u201d or \u201cbullying or coercion,\u201d but common principles and beliefs including \u201cthe peaceful resolution of disputes through dialogue \u2013 not coercion or conflict. And certainly not through so-called punishment.\u201d The remark appeared to be a thinly veiled reference to China\u2019s military drills around Taiwan last week, which Beijing said was a \u201cstrong punishment\u201d for the self-ruled island\u2019s \u201cseparatist acts.\u201d The massive show of force came just days after Taiwan swore in its new democratically elected leader Lai Ching-te, who called on Beijing to\u00a0cease its intimidation tactics. Austin said the new convergence helped the US make \u201chistoric progress\u201d in the past three years. \u201cWe\u2019ve strengthened stability on the Korean Peninsula. We\u2019ve supported the status quo across the Taiwan Strait. And we\u2019ve stood up for the rule of law in the South China Sea,\u201d he said. Under President Joe Biden, the US has bolstered ties with allies and like-minded partners in the Asia-Pacific region to counter a rising China, which under leader Xi Jinping has become increasingly\u00a0assertive\u00a0and belligerent about its many maritime and\u00a0territorial claims in the region \u2013 from Taiwan to the East and South China Seas. That bolstering of US ties has infuriated Beijing, which accuses Washington of leading a campaign of \u201cencirclement and suppression\u201d of China. Austin\u2019s emphasis on a \u201cnew convergence\u201d in Asia-Pacific appeared to have struck a raw nerve with the Chinese delegation in the audience. In the Q&A session, a Chinese colonel asked Austin whether the US is planning to build a NATO-like alliance system in the Asia-Pacific region, and blamed NATO for the Ukraine war. \u201cThe eastern border expansion of NATO has led to the Ukraine crisis. What implications do you think the straightening of the US alliances system in the Asia-Pacific will have on this region\u2019s security and stability?\u201d asked Cao Yanzhong, a\u00a0senior colonel\u00a0and\u00a0researcher\u00a0at the\u00a0Institute\u00a0of\u00a0War Studies\u00a0of the Academy\u00a0of\u00a0Military Sciences of the Chinese military. \u201cI respectfully disagree with your point that the expansion of NATO caused the Ukraine crisis,\u201d Austin replied, drawing a rare round of applause from the audience. \u201cThe Ukraine crisis obviously was caused because (Russian President) Mr (Vladimir) Putin made a decision to unlawfully invade his neighbor.\u201d The exchange came a day after Austin held his first face-to-face talks with China\u2019s Minister of National Defense Adm. Dong Jun on the sidelines of the defense forum. The rare talks between the US and Chinese defense chiefs touched on a host of fractious issues including Taiwan and China\u2019s relationship with Russia, as well as frictions in the South China Sea. On Saturday, Austin mentioned the meeting with Dong in his speech, saying they had a \u201cfrank discussion.\u201d \u201cThere is no substitute for direct military-to-military talks between senior leaders. And there\u2019s no substitute for open lines of communication to avoid misunderstandings and miscalculations,\u201d he said, adding that he looked forward to more talks with China. Austin also reiterated US commitment to its defense treaty with the Philippines, calling it \u201cironclad.\u201d Philippine President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr on Friday denounced illegal, coercive and aggressive actions in the South China Sea at the opening of the defense forum, saying peace, stability and prosperity in the waters was being undermined by other actors, without naming China. Austin also reaffirmed US commitment to the Asia-Pacific region, saying peace and stability across the region are crucial for the whole world. \u201cThe United States can be secure only if Asia is secure. That\u2019s why the United States has long maintained our presence in this region. And that\u2019s why we continue to make the investments necessary to meet our commitments to our allies and partners,\u201d he said. Hours after Austin\u00a0reaffirmed America\u2019s commitment to the Indo-Pacific, a Chinese military spokesman accused the United States of \u201ccreating division and provoking confrontation.\u201d \u201cThe US keeps creating chaos and has become the source of risks, as well as the destroyer to peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region,\u201d Jing Jianfeng, Deputy Chief of the Joint Staff Department at China\u2019s Central Military Commission, told a group of reporters in Singapore.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/asia/us-defense-chief-austin-shangrila-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "world"}}

If she wins, Sheinbaum would be not only the first female president in Mexico, but the first president with Jewish heritage, although she rarely speaks publicly about her personal background and has governed as a secular leftist. Her close alignment with L\u00f3pez Obrador has been both a blessing and a curse politically. Sheinbaum has said she\u2019s\u00a0\u201cnot a close copy\u201d of L\u00f3pez Obrador \u2013 but she also doesn\u2019t shy away from touting the principles they share, even repeating his slogans on the campaign trail. (L\u00f3pez Obrador has repeatedly dismissed whispers that he favors a candidate that he could influence, telling press in February that he would \u201cretire completely\u201d after his term.) Among her policies,\u00a0Sheinbaum has promised: \u2022 Continuing Lopez Obrador\u2019s pension for all senior citizens\u2022 Scholarships for more than 12 million students\u2022 Free fertilizers for small farm owners\u2022 On security, she proposed consolidating\u00a0the\u00a0National Guard, reform of judiciary, strengthening intelligence and research and coordination with law enforcement authorities. X\u00f3chitl G\u00e1lvez Backed by an opposition coalition of Mexico\u2019s PRI, PAN and PRD parties, X\u00f3chitl G\u00e1lvez is a former senator and previously served as the top official for indigenous affairs under former President Vicente Fox. The daughter of an indigenous father and a mixed-race mother, the 61-year-old was a businesswoman before entering politics. For a relative newcomer, Galvez\u2019s entry into the presidential race has\u00a0gained impressive momentum, experts say. Her proposals include: \u2022 Continuing Lopez Obrador\u2019s pension for all senior citizens\u2022 A \u201cuniversal social protection system\u201d of welfare programs for middle and lower classes\u2022 A security approach that would strengthen local and state police\u2022 Galvez has also hinted that that oil-rich Mexico should invest more in renewable energy, saying earlier this year: \u201cWe haven\u2019t done it because we are dumbasses.\u201d Jorge \u00c1lvarez M\u00e1ynez A late entrant in the race, Jorge \u00c1lvarez M\u00e1ynez shot to international attention earlier this month, when a stage collapsed at his campaign event in the northeastern city of San Pedro Garza Garc\u00eda, killing nine people and leaving at least 121 people injured. The 38-year-old has pledged to: \u2022 Eliminate the crime of simple drug possession to to stop criminalizing poverty, and move from prohibitionism to regulation of drugs\u2022 End the\u00a0longstanding militarization of Mexico\u00a0and instead focus on training and strengthening police\u2022 He has also proposed a gradual economic reform\u00a0including\u00a0a universal pension system, guaranteed labor rights and income and progressive tax reform\u2022 M\u00e1ynez\u00a0has also called for\u00a0transforming the Federal Electricity Commission (CFE) and Pemex into renewable and clean energy companies,\u00a0and\u00a0for closing some refineries The key issues: Security and migration Security and immigration are top issues for all of Mexico\u2019s presidential candidates. Campaigning in the run-up to the election has been marred by dozens of assassination attempts and other political violence. There are concerns now that that the attacks have already\u00a0cooled off campaigns; experts and political parties say some candidates have renounced their bids in fear of their lives. But electoral violence is just a part of Mexico\u2019s broader security crisis, with sky-high\u00a0crime\u00a0and\u00a0homicide rates.\u00a0In the first four and a half years of L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s government,\u00a0160,594 homicides were recorded\u00a0\u2013 a figure surpassing that\u00a0of\u00a0the previous administration. However, a report from the Mexican Peace Index (MPI), prepared by the\u00a0Institute for Economy and Peace\u00a0(IEP), has\u00a0offered\u00a0some reason for optimism, reporting improvements in\u00a0five key indicators: homicides, crimes with violence, fear of violence, crimes committed with firearms, and crimes of violence.\u00a0Homicides and crimes committed with\u00a0firearms peaked\u00a0in 2019, according to the May 2024 report,\u00a0and have since improved. Meanwhile, pressure is growing on Mexico\u2019s southern and northern borders. In 2023, the National Migration Institute (INM) recorded a\u00a077% increase in migrant arrivals compared to 2022. And as it grapples with the surge of migrants and asylum seekers entering and crossing its own territory, Mexico will also have to contend with external policies on migration. As an example, Myriam Guadalupe Castro Y\u00e1\u00f1ez, an academic at the National School of Social Work of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), points to a recent state law in Texas that has already caused waves in Mexico. In December, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott\u00a0signed a bill\u00a0that would allow state officials to detain and deport people suspected of having entered the United States illegally. The law is currently blocked in a US federal court, but the L\u00f3pez Obrador government has warned that it will not receive people deported by Texas and that it will only discuss immigration issues with Washington. Both Sheinbaum and G\u00e1lvez have stated their support for this stance.

{"id": "2024_05_31_asia_shangrila-dialogue-philippines-china-intl-hnk", "text": "The death of any Filipino citizen at the hands of another country in the South China Sea would be \u201cvery close\u201d to an act of war, Philippines President Ferdinand \u201cBongbong\u201d Marcos Jr. warned Friday as his nation faces increasingly fraught clashes with Chinese vessels in the South China Sea. Marcos delivered the keynote speech of the Shangri-la Dialogue in Singapore, a regional gathering of global security leaders, including US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and his Chinese counterpart Adm. Dong Jun. The Philippine president was asked by a member of the audience whether a \u201cred line\u201d would be crossed if Chinese Coast Guard ships, which have frequently deployed water cannons against Philippine vessels in recent months, ended up killing a Filipino sailor. \u201cIf a Filipino citizen is killed by a willful act, that is, I think, very, very close to what we define as an act of war and therefore we will respond accordingly,\u201d he replied. \u201cAnd our treaty partners, I believe, also hold that same standard,\u201d he added. China has increasingly pushed its territorial claims in the South China Sea, and China Coast Guard ships, reinforced by maritime militia boats, have been involved in a series of fraught clashes over the last year that has seen Philippine ships damaged and Filipino sailors injured by water cannon. With confrontations increasingly souring the Beijing-Manila relationship, Marcos has sought out closer ties with the United States, with which the Philippines maintains a mutual defense treaty. As part of that relationship, the US has gained increased rights to use Philippine military bases and the two allies have expanded bilateral military exercises. US officials consistently say the mutual defense pact is \u201ciron-clad\u201d and Philippine naval, coast guard and civilian vessels are covered by it. That raises the prospect that should one of the many maritime clashes between Chinese and Philippine vessels in the South China Sea turn deadly, it could pile pressure on Washington to support its ally \u2013 and even drag the US military into a conflict. \u201cWe already have suffered injury. But thank God we have not yet gotten to the point where any of our participants, civilian or otherwise have been killed,\u201d Marcos said, referring to increasingly fraught clashes with China\u2019s coast guard ships. \u201cBut once we get to that point (a fatality)\u2026 we would certainly have crossed the Rubicon. Is that a red line? Almost certainly it is going to be a red line,\u201d he said. Key global waterway China claims \u201cindisputable sovereignty\u201d over almost all of the 1.3 million-square-mile South China Sea \u2013 one of the world\u2019s busiest waterways. But portions of it are also claimed by governments in Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan as well as the Philippines. In 2016, in a case brought by the Philippines, an international tribunal in the Hague ruled that China\u2019s claim to historic rights to the bulk of the sea had no legal basis. But Beijing has rejected the tribunal\u2019s ruling and continued its military buildup, with many features lying hundreds of miles away from China\u2019s mainland. It also maintains a large presence of coast guard and fishing vessels \u2013 which has frequently stoked tensions with its neighbors. Marcos addressed the dispute multiple times in his speech. \u201cIllegal, coercive, aggressive, and deceptive actions continue to violate our sovereignty, sovereign rights, and jurisdiction,\u201d he said, adding that the Philippines would defend it\u2019s sovereignty to \u201cthe last square millimeter.\u201d \u201cThe life-giving waters of the West Philippine Sea flow in the blood of every Filipino. We cannot allow anyone to detach it from the totality of the maritime domain that renders our nation whole,\u201d he added. In the past week, Marcos has been raising concerns over a new Chinese policy that give its coast guard new powers of detention in Chinese-claimed areas of the South China Sea, including areas that lie within the Philippines Exclusive Economic Zone. Meanwhile, the Philippine Navy said it is prepared to protect the rights of Filipinos and would be increasing patrols in the South China Sea, including the areas of contested sovereignty, according to the PNA. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said earlier this week that the new regulations are \u201cin line with common international practices.\u201d \u201cAs long as there is no illegal behavior by any individual or entity, there is no need to worry,\u201d spokesperson Mao Ning said. \u201cWhat I want to emphasize is that it is not China but the Philippines that has frequently escalated the situation in the South China Sea,\u201d Ning added. In his speech Marcos also warned that growing rivalry between the United States and China was impacting the entire Asia-Pacific region. \u201cThe strategic competition between China and the United States is permeating the evolving regional landscape. This rivalry is constraining the strategic choices of regional states. This contest is exacerbating flashpoints, it has created new security dilemmas,\u201d Marcos told delegates. \u201cThe continued stability of this region requires China and the United States to manage that rivalry in a responsible manner,\u201d he added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/asia/shangrila-dialogue-philippines-china-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_01_asia_zelensky-shangri-la-dialogue-singapore-intl-hnk", "text": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenksy arrived in Singapore Saturday for a previously unannounced appearance at a summit of defense chiefs from across the Asia-Pacific as Ukraine\u2019s troops scramble to counter a major Russian advance into its northeast. Zelensky\u2019s surprise attendance at the gathering is a stark illustration of Kyiv\u2019s determination to keep the international community engaged in Ukraine\u2019s defense \u2013 and its vision for peace \u2013 more than two years into Russia\u2019s devastating invasion. The Ukrainian leader has traveled outside his embattled country sparingly during the war and earlier this month called off international engagements as his troops defended against the surprise Russian offensive in northeastern Kharkiv. A CNN team at the summit witnessed Zelensky and his delegation arriving. His attendance at the Shangri-la Dialogue in Singapore provides a\u00a0rare opportunity for Zelensky to potentially meet with defense chiefs from across the Asia-Pacific, including China which has deepened its relations with Moscow since the war. US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and defense heads from US allies Australia, Japan, and South Korea, as well as China\u2019s Defense Minster Dong Jun are expected to be in attendance for the three-day gathering. Announcing his arrival at the summit, Zelensky said in a statement on X that he would hold \u201ca number of meetings,\u201d in particular with Austin, Singapore\u2019s president and prime minister, Timor-Leste\u2019s president and Singaporean investors. The pentagon confirmed on Saturday that Austin would meet Zelensky and Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov at the Shangri-La on Sunday, \u201cto discuss the current battlefield situation in Ukraine and to underscore US commitment to ensuring Ukraine has what it needs to defend itself against ongoing Russian aggression.\u201d Zelensky arrives in Singapore weeks ahead of a Ukraine-backed peace summit slated to be held in Switzerland amid a mounting urgency for Kyiv to bolster international support for its peace plan \u2013 especially in the face of the looming US presidential elections, which could see a shift in the level of US support for his cause. Ukraine relies squarely on international funds and weapons \u2013 and faces shortages of manpower and equipment. Months of political wrangling on Capitol Hill as well as lack of supplies from NATO countries have kept Ukraine\u2019s forces significantly outgunned against Russia. A major $61 billion aid injection for Ukraine bill was finally passed by the US in late April. On Friday, Zelenksy was in Sweden for a summit with Northern European leaders where he said Ukraine\u2019s \u201ctop priorities\u201d were to ensure more air defense systems and weapons for Ukraine, as well as \u201cglobal efforts to force Russia to make peace,\u201d according to the leader\u2019s post on the platform X. In Asia, Zelensky may carry a similar message. The conflict, though a continent away, has been watched closely by governments across the region, especially those contending with territorial disputes with another military and authoritarian power in the region, China. The conflict in Europe is also widely seen to have impacted the security climate in Asia. Russia has nurtured a burgeoning relationship with North Korea, believed by Western governments to have supplied Russian forces with munitions in recent months. Moscow and Beijing have also deepened their strategic partnership during Russia\u2019s war, with the US accusing China of bolstering Russia\u2019s defense industrial base with dual-use exports \u2013 and divisions between China and the West deepening over Beijing\u2019s close Kremlin ties. Those exports were raised during a meeting Friday between Austin and his Chinese counterpart Dong Jun. Austin indicated to China that there would be consequences if Beijing continues to support Russia militarily, a senior US defense official said after the meeting. Dong said China, which claims neutrality in the conflict, had honored its \u201cpromise not to provide weapons to either side of the conflict\u201d and has strict controls on dual-use exports, according to China\u2019s spokesperson. Beijing also confirmed Friday that it would not send a delegation to the upcoming, Ukraine-backed peace conference in Switzerland, with its Foreign Ministry citing\u00a0its view that\u00a0any international peace conference should have \u201crecognition by both Russia and Ukraine, equal participation by all parties, and fair discussion of all peace plans.\u201d Zelensky\u2019s 10-point peace plan calls for Russia to withdraw all its troops from Ukrainian territory and the restoration of Ukraine\u2019s internationally recognized borders. Zelensky has previously made surprise appearances at global summits to keep attention focused on Ukraine\u2019s plight and strengthen ties \u2013 he famously dropped in on the Group of 7 (G7) summit last year in Japan. It\u2019s not clear if he will have an opportunity to meet with any Chinese officials during his time in Singapore. Russia is not participating in the gathering. In an interview with Russia\u2019s state news agency RIA Novosti, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov suggested Thursday that China could organize a peace conference involving both Russia and Ukraine. Zelensky\u2019s arrival also comes as US President Joe Biden broke from long-standing policy to give Ukraine permission to use American munitions for limited strikes within Russian territory close to the border with Kharkiv, CNN reported Thursday, citing US officials. Key European leaders have also signaled a similar position shift. However, the US elections have raised uncertainty over the level of US support for Ukraine\u2019s war effort if the fighting continues into next year \u2013\u2013 widely seen as adding another measure of urgency to Ukraine\u2019s push for peace on its terms. Biden, a staunch supporter of Kyiv, competes for office against former President Donald Trump, who in the past refused to say whether he wants Russia or Ukraine to win the war and raised questions about his commitment to America\u2019s NATO allies.

{"id": "2024_05_25_style_zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk", "text": "Above Beijing\u2019s imperial center rises Jingshan, or Prospect Hill. From a pagoda at its modest peak, a panoramic view of the city presents itself. To the south, the dull golden roofs of the Forbidden City crest and fall, pulling the eye southward to Tiananmen \u2014 the Gate of Heavenly Peace \u2014 and the vast square of the same name just beyond. To the east stand the smooth metallic skyscrapers of the city\u2019s business district. To the north, at the top of Beijing\u2019s central axis \u2014 its so-called dragon\u2019s vein \u2014 sit the Bell and Drum Towers, which once acted as the city\u2019s collective timepiece. And stretching all along the western periphery are the calm, tree-lined waters of the manmade lakes, dug by hand for the pleasure of past emperors. It\u2019s this aerial view of \u201cZhongnanhai,\u201d meaning \u201cmiddle and southern seas,\u201d and the surrounding buildings that today\u2019s Chinese leaders prefer you did not see. That\u2019s because the 1,500-acre site of repurposed imperial pavilions and temples, along with gray modern offices has formed the leadership compound for the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP)  since 1950. As the seat of power, Zhongnanhai is often thought of as China\u2019s equivalent to the White House, or the Kremlin. Synonymous with China\u2019s communist party elite, and among the country\u2019s most secretive places, it is ringed by a centuries-old red ochre wall, with countless CCTV cameras periscoping above it \u2014 and patrolled assiduously by security forces in both plain clothes and uniform. A peaceful getaway For Chinese leader Xi Jinping\u2019s imperial forebears, the site served a somewhat different function. While emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties ruled their vast kingdom from within the Forbidden City, they built temples, halls and living quarters in Zhongnanhai; less grandly ceremonial than those of the palace, they were often oriented to take advantage of the views afforded by the area\u2019s tranquil waters and carefully planned gardens. Many of these emperors came to favor passing their days surrounded by drooping willows in the cool and quiet of this cultivated pleasure garden. A story relayed by the scholar Geremie Barm\u00e9 in his book \u201cThe Forbidden City\u201d tells of the 18th-century Qianlong Emperor\u2019s daily routine at Zhongnanhai: Each morning, after a first breakfast of cold swallows nest soup, he would travel by heated palanquin to the gardens\u2019\u00a0Studio of Convivial Delight,\u00a0a pavilion he built to capitalize on the view of the South Lake, where he would breakfast again on a meal of\u00a018 dishes. As the historian and author of \u201cThe Shortest History of China,\u201d Linda Jaivin, told CNN via email: \u201cThere is something outrageous and yet poetic about the incredible coordination and effort required of a team of bearers, cooks and attendants, just so that an emperor could come, catch a view of the magnificent Ocean Terrace, scoff his food and (leave).\u201d The first ruler to view Zhongnanhai as primarily a place to govern from, not simply relax in, was the Empress Dowager Cixi, who effectively controlled China for almost five decades from 1861. She lived for many years in the gardens\u2019 Hall of Ceremonial Phoenixes, which became the center of political authority in China. She would die there in 1908. The serene surroundings of Zhongnanhai also became, under Cixi, a place of punishment and confinement. In 1898, following attempted reforms that displeased her, Cixi imprisoned her nephew, the Guangxu Emperor, on Yingtai Island, which juts out into the southern lake. Built as a miniature version of the mythical Penglai island, home to the immortals of Chinese legend, the tiny piece of land would become the emperor\u2019s home for most of his life, bar a brief period when the Boxer rebellion of 1900 forced the whole court to flee the capital. He would die on Yingtai Island from arsenic poisoning the day before the Empress Dowager herself. His imprisonment and death, said writer M. A. Aldrich, author of \u201cThe Search for a Vanishing Beijing: A Guide to China\u2019s Capital Through the Ages,\u201d perhaps adds a touch of poignancy for any subsequent resident of Zhongnanhai. \u201cIn addition to being a site that preserves sites of imperial splendor,\u201d he told CNN, \u201cit also functions as a reminder to the political elite about the consequences for stepping out of line.\u201d For Aldrich, however, the Zhongnanhai compound also represents the destructive impulses of the CCP towards its adopted capital in the years after 1949, when Mao Zedong proclaimed the foundation of the People\u2019s Republic. \u201cAs a political symbol of the New China, it has been torn up, rebuilt, expanded, and revamped so many times that its connection with its elegant past has been lost,\u201d Aldrich said. Architectural changes There have been serious revisions to the architecture of Zhongnanhai since the end of imperial rule in 1912. After the last emperor abdicated the throne, China\u2019s new president Yuan Shikai granted him the right to live on the northern section of the Forbidden City \u2014 and then took Zhongnanhai to be his new administration\u2019s headquarters. The changes he made to the imperial gardens were disparaged by many of the Westerners who visited them. \u201cWhatever may be one\u2019s opinion as to whether Yuan Shikai \u2018exalted his aim\u2019 in his political career, he certainly cannot be said to have done so as builder and architect,\u201d wrote L.C. Arlington and William Lewisohn in their 1935 book \u201cIn Search of Old Peking,\u201d \u201cfor all the buildings that have been erected or restored by him are in the worst possible taste.\u201d Most notable of these changes \u2014 at least to ordinary Beijingers \u2014 was the repurposing of a two-story pavilion at the very south of the gardens. Known as the Precious Moon Tower, it had been built decades earlier by the Qianlong Emperor for a homesick lover, a Muslim woman from Xinjiang, taken to Beijing as part of the spoils of war. The concubine would gaze south from the tower toward a mock mosque and bazaar the emperor had especially constructed to assuage her longing for home. Yuan refashioned this pavilion into the main entrance to his presidential compound, and established a tall watchtower just to its east. The gate was named Xinhuamen, or the Gate of New China. Today, the structure remains coated in the same deep red that graces the walls of all Beijing\u2019s imperial buildings, with a roof of glazed yellow tiles and detailing that runs below the roofline, picked out in blue and gold. The gate is now flanked by two red banners that speak to its modern purpose as China\u2019s political and party headquarters: \u201cLong Live the Great Communist Party of China\u201d reads one; and \u201cLong Live the Invincible Mao Zedong Thought\u201d on the other. On a screen wall recessed behind the entrance way, Chinese characters written in Mao\u2019s own calligraphic style declare: \u201cServe the People.\u201d Facing out onto Beijing\u2019s main east-west thoroughfare, the gate remains the most conspicuous part of Zhongnanhai. The rest of the compound has, since 1989, been firmly off-limits to the Chinese public. Seat of power Initially, after the communist victory in China\u2019s civil war in 1949, Mao Zedong took up residence at Shuangqing Villa in Fragrant Hills, another former imperial garden to the west of Beijing. Though wary of establishing himself in the imperial heart of Beijing \u2014 it is said that he refused ever to enter the Forbidden City, for fear of being associated with the power structures of old, feudal China he had fought to overthrow \u2014 Mao ultimately moved into Zhongnanhai and, in late 1949, he set up in the\u00a0Garden of Abundant Beneficence,\u00a0a large courtyard compound favored by both the Qianlong and Kangxi emperors, where he would hold court with dignitaries\u00a0and live\u00a0until 1966. Having re-established Zhongnanhai as a center of political power in the new China, Mao set about rebuilding the compound according to his tastes. \u201cSince 1949, an assortment of new architecture styles has encroached into Zhongnanhai, with a tennis court, gymnasium, swimming pools and Western buildings topped off with Chinese eave roofs adding a discordant note that would not have been appreciated by its traditionally-minded original owners,\u201d said Aldrich. In 1966, Mao moved from the Garden of Abundant Beneficence to a specially built house beside his beloved indoor swimming pool. He often summoned officials to speak to him as he bobbed in the water \u2014 and famously received Russian leader Nikita Khrushchev at his pool during a 1958 visit. \u201cTheir interpreters had to pace alongside the edge of the pool,\u201d said Jaivin. \u201cThe Russian couldn\u2019t swim and had to wear water wings. Mao loved both swimming and putting Khrushchev in his place. Finally, Khrushchev got sick of it, and clambered out to sit on the edge, dangling his feet in the water.\u201d In the residence next door, Mao lined his rooms with bookshelves housing an extensive library of Chinese classical literature. \u201cIt was here,\u201d noted Aldrich, \u201cwith the background trappings of a scholar, that he met Nixon and Kissinger in 1972.\u201d Most subsequent leaders have preferred to keep a house outside the Zhongnanhai compound. Deng Xiaoping lived, from 1977, in a courtyard house on a nearby lane adjacent to Beihai, the \u201cNorthern Sea\u201d of central Beijing\u2019s chain of lakes. While not officially disclosed, it is believed that more contemporary leaders, including Xi Jinping and his predecessors Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, have maintained homes in an exclusive gated compound in Jade Spring Hill, sometimes called the \u201cback garden\u201d of Chinese politics, out to the city\u2019s west. Aldrich noted that those leaders and party cadres who used Zhongnanhai as their primary residence often attracted unwelcome scrutiny for their activities, particularly during years of political turbulence. \u201cIn his memoirs, Chairman Mao\u2019s physician, Li Zhisui, commented that (the complex\u2019s) residents were always under surveillance,\u201d Aldrich said. \u201cDuring the Cultural Revolution, the simple act of making a fire would bring down the wrath of the security guards on the perpetrator. It was believed that such a fire was proof that incriminating or seditious materials were being destroyed.\u201d The imperial gardens offering vistas of Zhongnanhai\u2019s lakes have, today, been filled in with dozens of gray offices and meeting halls, many of which date to 1970s, when Zhongnanhai underwent significant razing and renovation \u2014 the rebuilding was so extensive that one visitor in 1979 described the grounds resembling a construction site, with muddy roads that were impossible to walk on. The contemporary compound splits roughly in two, with the northern buildings, on the banks of the \u201cmiddle lake,\u201d used as the headquarters of China\u2019s top executive body, the State Council. It is here that foreign dignitaries are admitted. Around the \u201csouthern lake,\u201d meanwhile, are the headquarters of the CCP, including, within Qinzheng Hall (the Hall of Diligent Government), the offices of the general secretary of the party (a post currently held by Xi). Many of the most historically significant political events to occur at Zhongnanhai have taken place in Huairen Hall, or the Hall of Cherished Compassion, on the western side of the Middle Lake. The hall was added to the imperial park during the late Qing dynasty, but was then extensively remodeled by the CCP in the early 1950s to impart a more august socialist grandeur. It is a broad, imposing ceremonial hall with staggered roofs of glazed green tiles falling in curved lines to upturned corners; the facade of austere grey brick is interrupted by red wooden pillars, windows and doors. The building\u2019s capacious interior houses a large auditorium, as well as numerous smaller meeting rooms. The hall has, for decades, served as the main meeting place for China\u2019s Politburo, the party\u2019s decision-making body usually comprising about two dozen members. On occasion, it has also hosted the Politburo\u2019s Standing Committee, the core of China\u2019s political elite, (the power of both bodies has notably dwindled in the era of Xi), though they most commonly meet in Qinzheng Hall, close to the general secretary\u2019s office. During the tumult of the Cultural Revolution vital discussions and debates occurred at Huairen Hall, and, in the months after its conclusion, it was there that three of the so-called Gang of Four \u2014 the political faction that included Mao\u2019s wife held responsible for the worst excesses of the era \u2014 were arrested, tricked into attending a meeting they thought was about the publication of the fifth volume of Mao\u2019s Selected Works. In April 1989, former party head Hu Yaobang suffered a heart-attack during a Politburo meeting at Huairen; his death a week later would trigger the Tiananmen Square protests that the government forcibly cracked down on in early June of that year. However, the compound hasn\u2019t always been so forbidden for the masses following the collapse of China\u2019s imperial dynasty. In the late 1920s, it became a park, with tourists allowed to boat on and swim in the lakes, while in the 1980s, the public could access some of its scenic and historical spots, including\u00a0Mao\u2019s\u00a0former residence, on\u00a0organized weekend tours.\u00a0Even early in 1989, a journalist for the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0was able to casually\u00a0drive\u00a0a senior official into the compound and drop him off inside.\u00a0During a period of warmer US and China relations in 2011, former Chinese president\u00a0Hu Jintao\u00a0invited\u00a0a group of American high school students to Zhongnanhai. Modern security concerns Today, Zhongnanhai is more closely-guarded than ever, though the inexorable development of the city has caused problems in maintaining the compound\u2019s secrecy. When an annex to the nearby Beijing Hotel was built in\u00a01973, authorities were panicked by the realization that from its upper floors one could quite easily see \u2013 and potentially target a sniper rifle \u2013 into Zhongnanhai. A building was hastily erected on the western edge of the Forbidden City to restrict this view. Likewise in 2018, when Beijing\u2019s new tallest building was\u00a0completed\u00a0\u2013 the 528-meter Citic tower, better known as the \u201cZun\u201d \u2013 the country\u2019s national security apparatus reportedly requisitioned the top floors amid fears that visitors or occupants might be able to spy into the compound. Beijing authorities did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on the security situation at the time. Zhongnanhai\u2019s entrance, Xinhuamen, has also been the site of repeated demonstrations in recent decades; in 1989, it was a gathering point for students taking part in the Tiananmen protests, whilst in 1999, more than 10,000 members of the since-banned Falun Gong gathered on the sidewalks near Zhongnanhai to protest their treatment at the hands of the government. So, while Zhongnanhai is sometimes compared to the White House, Aldrich argues that the paranoia with which the compound is today guarded makes it more like the imperial palace of centuries past: \u201cSince ordinary people are not allowed to enter Zhongnanhai, it is probably more appropriate to describe it as a \u2018New Forbidden City\u2019 for China\u2019s ruling elite rather than a place with a personal political resonance for the average citizen,\u201d he said. \u201cHeck, even the Kremlin is open to tourists!\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/style/zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "world"}}

Young adults will be able to choose between spending one weekend a month volunteering over the course of a year, or take up one of 30,000 spaces to spend a year in the armed forces, Sunak said. The announcement followed Labour Party leader Keir Starmer\u2019s comments on Saturday that he was in favour of allowing 16 and 17-year-olds to vote.

There\u2019s no doubt that our democratic values are under threat. That is why we will introduce a bold new model of national service for 18-year-olds,\u201d Sunak said in a statement. The Conservative Party said the proposal would be funded by cracking down on tax avoidance and evasion, and by diverting money from the\u00a0UK\u00a0Shared Prosperity Fund, which existed to reduce regional economic inequality. Labour politicians derided the announcement. \u201cThe national service we need from our young people is to vote for change on July 4,\u201d said Andy Burnham, mayor of Greater Manchester.

{"id": "2024_05_31_middleeast_idf-central-rafah-intl", "text": "The Israeli military is in central Rafah, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed in a statement Friday, despite international concern and anger over its military operation in Gaza\u2019s southernmost city. The IDF statement confirms what eyewitnesses told CNN earlier this week, when tanks were spotted in central Rafah for the first time since it entered the city earlier this month. \u201cIDF\u00a0troops in central Rafah located Hamas rocket launchers, terror tunnel shafts, and weapons. The troops also dismantled a Hamas weapons storage facility in the area,\u201d the\u00a0IDF\u00a0said in the statement. On Wednesday, the Israeli military said it had established \u201coperational control\u201d over the Philadelphi Corridor, a 14-kilometer (8.7-mile) buffer zone on the Palestinian side of the Egypt-Gaza border. Access to cell phone services in Rafah was interrupted on Thursday due to the ongoing Israeli offensive,\u00a0Palestinian telecommunications company Jawwal said in a\u00a0statement. Israel\u2019s incursion into Rafah earlier in May marked a new phase in its war against Hamas in Gaza, which has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians, according to health officials in the enclave, displaced the majority of the strip\u2019s population and sparked a humanitarian catastrophe that has appalled international agencies. Over the weekend, Israel launched an airstrike on a displacement camp in the city, killing dozens and creating global outrage. The strike also took out two Hamas leaders, Israel said. Footage obtained by CNN showed the camp in flames, with scores of men, women and children frantically trying to find cover from the nighttime assault. Burned bodies, including those of children, could be seen being pulled by rescuers from the wreckage. \u201cThe word tragic doesn\u2019t even begin to describe it,\u201d US Vice President Kamala Harris said of the incident on Tuesday. But neither she or President Joe Biden have said the strike crossed a red line for US support. Biden had said in a CNN interview earlier this month\u00a0that he wouldn\u2019t allow certain US weapons to be\u00a0used in a major offensive in Rafah. The confirmation of the IDF\u2019s presence in central Rafah came as it said it had ended operations in eastern\u00a0Jabalya,\u00a0in the north of the Gaza Strip. The military said in a statement that its troops had destroyed more than 10 kilometres (six miles) of tunnels and weapons production sites in the Jabalya operation, which began earlier this month and involved what the IDF described as \u201cintense combat and close-quarters encounters\u201d with combatants. The statement also said the bodies of seven hostages were recovered during the operation. The hostages were killed on October 7, it said, and their remains were then taken to Gaza. But Mahmoud Basal, a civil defense spokesperson in Gaza, told CNN on Friday that\u00a0Jabalya\u00a0was a \u201cdisaster area\u201d following Israel\u2019s presence, with \u201centire residential squares\u201d decimated. \u201cJabalya\u00a0camp is not suitable for life, unfortunately,\u201d Basal said. \u201cThere are no water wells, schools, or hospitals, all of which have been completely destroyed. There is nothing that would enable the life of the citizen in this area, and there are a large number of martyrs and houses that have been leveled to the ground with citizens inside them, and we cannot recover the bodies from under the rubble.\u201d Israel resumed fighting in northern Gaza earlier this month, despite having said it had dismantled Hamas\u2019 command structure in the area back in January. The renewed fighting show the challenges Israel faces in achieving its goal of destroying Hamas, with a top security official this month warning the war could last into next year.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/middleeast/idf-central-rafah-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "world"}}

Pedestrian-friendly destinations Few things in life are as delightful as ambling around a new neighborhood in a new city, chancing upon cute stores, bars, eateries and public spaces. But decades of car-centric policies means lots of cities around the world lack an abundance of pedestrian-friendly streets, a new study called \u201cThe ABC of Mobility\u201d has found. The bigger and richer the city, the less likely it is to be easily walkable. But there are plenty of exceptions, as the stats from the study broken down by The Economist newspaper show. The Mozambique seaport of Quelimane, population 350,000, comes out as the most foot-friendly of the 794 cities surveyed in the study, but there are some less off-the-radar destinations in Europe (whose metropolises rank considerably higher than those of the United States). In the Netherlands, the tree-lined canals of Utrecht (No. 3) and the monumental splendor of The Hague (No. 27) are quieter alternatives to tourist favorite Amsterdam (No. 66). In northern Spain, the port city of Bilbao (No. 8) is famous for its Frank Gehry\u2013designed Guggenheim Museum, and Le\u00f3n (No. 9) boasts Roman ruins and Gothic cathedrals.

Four decades on, he is still waiting for a measure of justice to address his claims against Sodalitium Christianae Vitae (SCV), a\u00a0secretive\u00a0Roman Catholic society founded in Peru that has been mired in scandal since its layman founder Luis Fernando Figari and other senior members were accused of sexually abusing numerous adult and minor recruits. Santiago\u00a0says\u00a0that he was sexually abused by Figari at least three times in the 1970s, when he turned 17. He recalled Figari leading him to a room and raping him, saying it was \u201cthe only way to correctly see his aura.\u201d He doesn\u2019t\u00a0clearly\u00a0remember other incidents. \u201cIt is difficult to count because your brain starts to block things, I have tried, but there are some memories that are blocked,\u201d he said. CNN has reached out to Figari\u2019s legal team\u00a0as well as SCV for comment.\u00a0Figari has denied all the allegations against him. Santiago is among the dozens of reported\u00a0victims\u00a0who have been waiting eagerly for the Vatican to reveal its findings about the SCV allegations, after a months-long investigation. SCV has already admitted that sexual, physical and\u00a0psychological\u00a0abuse took place. In 2017, it removed Figari\u00a0from the group and published a\u00a0two-part report\u00a0by international experts that found that more than a dozen men and three women alleged being sexually\u00a0abused\u00a0by SCV members\u00a0when they were young adults. In the report\u2019s preface, SCV asked for \u201cforgiveness from each person that has been hurt by a member or a former member of the\u00a0Sodalitium,\u201d and\u00a0said the organization was \u201ccommitted to a process of self-examination and of change.\u201d Now the case has moved into the hands of church authorities in Vatican City, whom victims hope will be able to take serious measures including disbanding the entire organization. As part of the ongoing investigation, the Vatican sent letters to several SCV members in February giving them 45 days to respond to allegations of abuse, according to a source familiar with the investigation. Vatican top abuse investigators, Archbishop Charles Scicluna and Monsignor Jordi Bertomeu,\u00a0made a\u00a0surprise\u00a0visit to Lima in July 2023, interviewing\u00a0victims including\u00a0Santiago and SCV representatives, among others. SCV told CNN via email the organization received specific guidance from the Vatican\u2019s mission in March to open investigations against former members, but the information is confidential. For now, it is unclear when the investigation results will be delivered, or in what form. But in August last year, Pope Francis confirmed to\u00a0reporters,\u00a0\u201cWe\u00a0are working on this. We are trying to bring the situation to light.\u201d Decades of \u2018impunity\u2019 SCV was founded in 1971 in Peru and has chapters across Latin America. In Peru, the lay organization,\u00a0under Figari\u2019s charge, recruited mostly young White\u00a0boys from elite Catholic schools and upper and middle-class families with political or business links, journalist and SCV\u00a0victim\u00a0Pedro Salinas told CNN. Many of them came from\u00a0families with divorced or single parents, according to former members. An explosive 2015 book by journalists Salinas and Paola Ugaz revealed 30 anonymous testimonies from SCV victims\u00a0including Santiago\u2019s, shocking conservative Peruvian society but only resulting in\u00a0failed leadership reforms and an ongoing court case against the group that has largely gone nowhere. In the book, titled \u201cHalf Monks, Half Soldiers,\u201d former SCV\u00a0members detailed that once the recruits reached the legal age, 18, they were encouraged to leave home and cut ties with family\u00a0and friends. Teenagers who were recruited were\u00a0brainwashed \u201cto become a kind of zombie, a robot, a fanatic, where there is a syncretism that mixes the Catholic religion with fascist ideas \u2013 Spanish fascism,\u201d according to Salinas, who says he himself was physically and psychologically abused at the Sodalitium when he was a teenager. Figari was seen as a charismatic figure, but he was also\u00a0described by former and current members as\u00a0\u201cvulgar, vindictive, manipulative, racist, sexist, elitist,\u00a0and obsessed with\u00a0sexual issues and the sexual orientation of SCV members,\u201d the 2017 SCV report found. It added that Figari committed \u201cmultiple acts of sodomy of a minor male and a young adult male,\u201d\u00a0filmed young recruits \u201cin their underwear or bathing suits,\u201d and\u00a0directed them to perform sex acts on each other and himself, all under the justification of it being part of their spiritual formation. Figari denied\u00a0all\u00a0the\u00a0allegations publicly for the first time in 2016. \u201cI\u2019m innocent, totally innocent. I come here to tell the truth because the authorities have not allowed me to speak,\u201d\u00a0Figari told reporters in Rome. CNN has requested an interview with Figari\u2019s lawyer but has not received any response. It is believed he still resides in Italy. Military training and alleged sexual abuse When Santiago first joined the group as a curious student, he was keen to learn not only about religion but also about mysticism and the power of the mind, he told CNN. At the age of 15, Figari told him he had great mental powers and offered to train him in ancient techniques, Santiago said.\u00a0Part of this training involved Santiago only\u00a0wearing underwear and sitting on Figari\u2019s leg, he said. On another occasion, Figari made Santiago and another minor sit in the lotus position and asked them to touch each other, including their genitals, Santiago said. Years later, Santiago first reported his abuse to SCV members and filed a complaint against Figari at Lima\u2019s Archdiocesan Tribunal in 2011.\u00a0He did not get an official response or follow up,\u00a0he said. According to the 2017 SCV report, Figari also\u00a0imposed military training, gleaned from movies he watched, on the young recruits: Young boys were ordered to swim \u201cin cold ocean waters for several hours at a time\u201d\u00a0late at night or very early in the morning,\u00a0run long distances in severe weather and sleep on floors or stairs. Another\u00a0victim,\u00a0Oscar Osterling, now 51, told CNN that when he was 18 he and three other recruits were made to form a line naked and were filmed. He eventually joined SCV\u2019s team as community leader\u00a010\u00a0years later but said he\u00a0regrets potentially playing a part in the psychological abuse of other young recruits. \u201cAfter making my complaint I thought: \u201cHow many people I have also affected?,\u201d he said, adding that he has since \u201ccalled many people to ask for forgiveness.\u201d SCV declined to be interviewed for this article, saying they are fully cooperating with the Vatican\u2019s inquiry and highlighted\u00a0a private audience between its General Superior Jose David Correa and Pope Francis on\u00a0December\u00a01, when they shared \u201cupdated information about the organization.\u201d The search for justice According to Salinas and other victims, the steps toward accountability taken by SCV so far are not enough. They want to see the perpetrators formally punished and the organization dissolved. The Peruvian legal system so far has not led to any\u00a0resolution. A criminal case in Peru against Figari and other SCV members was dropped by Peru\u2019s prosecutor\u2019s office in 2017, with prosecutors\u00a0saying\u00a0none of the alleged sexual abuse\u00a0victims\u00a0had come forward and\u00a0that\u00a0the alleged crimes fell outside the statute of limitations.\u00a0A\u00a0separate case on allegations of kidnapping, serious psychological injuries, and illicit association to commit a crime, is still working its way through the justice system. \u201cAfter so many years, this legal case is about justice for the victims and not about money, and that also means no impunity for those who have committed those crimes,\u201d\u00a0Dr. Jose Ugaz, former ad-hoc state attorney who represents seven of the victims,\u00a0told CNN. His clients demand\u00a0\u201cthis organization to stop\u00a0and (that)\u00a0harm does not continue to be caused to new children, teenagers or young people in Peru and in other several countries where it has expanded,\u201d he said. \u201cSodalitium is still active.\u201d Salinas, who has written to Pope Francis about the case, is pinning his hopes for justice on the Vatican\u2019s investigation. The Vatican has the power to dissolve SCV \u2013 a measure that Peruvian Cardinal Pedro Barreto has already called for. Pope Francis could also order sweeping reforms of the group, including the expulsion of members and special measures that must be followed. And the Pope recently changed the church\u2019s Code of Canon Law in 2021 to make lay people who hold an office in the church accountable for abuse, which would appear to\u00a0apply to Figari,\u00a0who is not a cleric. Church penalties for him could include fines, removal from all offices and expulsion from SCV. For the victims,\u00a0it\u2019s\u00a0about being heard and recognized after so many years. \u201cI felt privileged, I felt listened to \u2026 (with) that phone call,\u201d\u00a0 Santiago told CNN about\u00a0when he first learned the Pope\u2019s envoys wanted to meet him.

{"id": "2024_05_26_europe_germany-afd-elections-analysis-intl", "text": "A right-wing German lawmaker made comments seen as so explosively outside the mainstream of acceptable political discourse, that his party was disowned by other far-right leaders, breaking a major coalition in the European Parliament. Maximilian Krah, of the Alternative for Deutschland (AfD) party, told an Italian newspaper that he didn\u2019t view all members of a notorious Nazi paramilitary group automatically as criminals. He claimed that some in the SS, whose primary role was guarding concentration camps during World War II, were in fact just farmers. \u201cBefore I declare someone a criminal, I want to know what he did. Among the 900,000 SS men there were also many farmers: there was certainly a high percentage of criminals, but not all of them were. I will never say that anyone who wore an SS uniform was automatically a criminal,\u201d Krah told La Repubblica last weekend. The AfD have since banned the 47-year-old Krah, their leading candidate in next month\u2019s European elections, from making public appearances. Experts say his remarks have also caused reverberations across Europe\u2019s far-right, shining a light on how the continent\u2019s far-right parties view themselves and their associations. After Krah\u2019s interview was published on Saturday, his party suspended him on Wednesday, and said that he had taken \u201dfull responsibility\u201d for his actions and agreed to step down from its federal executive board with immediate effect. In a scathing statement, the AfD accused Krah of having caused \u201cmassive damage to the party in the current election campaign, for which the candidate had provided the pretext.\u201d It is not immediately clear if Krah remains the AfD\u2019s official lead candidate for the upcoming European election. Lorenz Blumenthaler, a political analyst at the Amadeu Antonio Foundation in Berlin \u2013 which runs educational projects and researches right-wing extremism, racism and antisemitism \u2013 told CNN that the AfD only takes action like this in certain circumstances. \u201cThe only time when there exists this red line is when they feel like it\u2019s hurting their voting result. And that\u2019s the only time when they will act or whether they fear that it will basically change the way German security forces perceive them as the AfD.\u201d Blumenthaler added that reprimanding Krah this close to a major election is a pretty drastic step politically. It \u201cdelegitimizes you as a political party and hurts you much more than just running with a lazy dog (or deadweight candidate),\u201d he told CNN. Kicked out of a far-right coalition On Thursday, a far-right coalition of parties in the European Parliament expelled the AfD from the group. The Identity and Democracy (ID) bloc said in a statement, they had decided to exclude the AfD, \u201cwith immediate effect,\u201d adding that \u201cthe ID Group no longer wants to be associated with the incidents involving Maximilian Krah, head of the AfD list for the European elections.\u201d In Paris, the leaders of French right-wing party National Rally (RN) \u2013 the successor to the Front National led by Marine Le Pen, and part of the ID alliance \u2013 also dissociated themselves from the AfD. RN President Jordan Bardella said in a French TV debate on Tuesday that the AfD had \u201ccrossed red lines.\u201d \u201cWe will have new allies after the European elections and will no longer be in the same group as the AfD,\u201d Bardella added. Joe D\u00fcker, a researcher at the extremism monitoring think tank the Center for Monitoring, Analysis and Strategy (CeMAS), told CNN that European far-right parties, and RN in particular, have been trying to present themselves as more moderate. \u201cFar-right populists are always trying to appeal to a broad voter base and they are always trying to give themselves an image that seems cleaner than they actually are. We know that Le Pen\u2019s party has been trying to clean up their image in the past couple of years. She broke with her father, the founder of that party, because of that.\u201d Blumenthaler described this image cleansing as the \u201cmost absurd dynamic that we have, a new far-right self-consciousness all over Europe.\u201d That sense of self-awareness doesn\u2019t seem to extend to the AfD, though. There have been a series of incidents where AfD\u00a0members have expressed far-right ideologies openly in Germany. Recently scandals have also seen members accused of spying for China and accepting bribes from Russia. Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke, a regional leader for AfD in the eastern state of Thuringia, was fined \u20ac13,000 ($14,000) by a German court earlier in May for using banned Nazi slogans, according to CNN affiliate N-TV. H\u00f6cke, a former history teacher, intends to run as the lead candidate for the AfD in the upcoming state elections in September, and is currently the clear favorite to win. According to Blumenthaler, these incidents don\u2019t appear to hurt the party, especially in Germany. \u201cAfter basically crashing the (far-right) European coalition, that really hurts the AfD on a European level, but I don\u2019t really think that it will affect their electoral base here in Germany that much,\u201d he added. Expect more of the same D\u00fcker told CNN that the trend of increased AfD extremism is likely to continue. \u201cWe can expect that things that are more radical, more extreme will become more acceptable,\u201d he said. The AfD\u2019s open radicalism is an interesting phenomenon for Blumenthaler too, especially when compared to its European allies. \u201cIt\u2019s still the Austrians and the German far-right branches that are the craziest\u2026 you would think that the taboo due to the German and Austrian past would be far higher here. And that the far right would act far more strategically trying to whitewash what they say how they act, but instead they are becoming more and more radicalized,\u201d he told CNN. The AfD is under domestic surveillance for the threat it poses to Germany\u2019s democracy and despite a recent dip is currently polling higher than each of the three parties in the coalition now governing the country. D\u00fcker noted a similarity between the AfD and Donald Trump, adding that: \u201cThe more scandals and the more outrageous things the ex-President said, the more his followers seemed to commit to him even more. And something similar appears to be going on with the AfD.\u201d Barbie Nadeau in Rome and James Frater in London contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/26/europe/germany-afd-elections-analysis-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_04_17_style_copenhagen-stock-exchange-fire-police-investigation-intl", "text": "Police launched an investigation Wednesday into the fire that tore through Copenhagen\u2019s famous stock exchange building, causing the collapse of its spire and damaging centuries-old artwork and architecture. The blaze was still burning on Wednesday afternoon, more than 24 hours after it began, and authorities and citizens in the Danish capital have started reckoning with the loss of one of the city\u2019s most recognizable landmarks. Local firefighters continued to try to put out the fire, which ripped through\u00a0the building \u2013 known locally as B\u00f8rsen \u2013\u00a0from early Tuesday, reaching all its floors and causing the collapse of a dragon-tail spire that had long been a symbol of the city. The walls of the building are still standing, but the interior has been significantly damaged and the roof is partially collapsed. Firefighters used cranes to hose water down into the building. Copenhagen\u00a0police meanwhile launched an investigation on Wednesday, which they said will be a \u201ccomplicated process.\u201d Police officer Brian Belling said authorities have already \u201cconducted interviews, secured surveillance and carried out a large number of investigative steps.\u201d \u201cBut of course, there is still a lot to do, especially as we have not yet had the opportunity to examine\u00a0B\u00f8rsen itself,\u201d Belling added. The 17th century building exemplified the style of the Dutch Renaissance, and housed a number of artworks, some of which were saved on Tuesday. Residents were stunned by the outbreak, which brought back memories of the fire that tore through the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris exactly five years and a day earlier. \u201cMy first thought was (that) I hope that they rebuild it \u2013 it\u2019s never going to be the same but it\u2019s iconic to\u00a0Copenhagen\u00a0and Denmark,\u201d teacher Eva Simoni Lomholdt, 58, told Reuters. Brian Mikkelsen, the CEO of the Danish Chamber of Commerce which owns the building, told the news agency that a firefighter gave him the top of the spire on Wednesday morning after it was recovered following its fall. \u201cIt gives me hope because we have decided to rebuild the stock exchange because it\u2019s part of European history as a trading continent,\u201d he said. The old stock exchange \u2013 located only a few minutes walk from Christiansborg\u00a0Palace \u2013 dates back to 1625. It was built in the Dutch Renaissance style at the request of King Christian IV and had recently been undergoing renovations with its facade covered in scaffolding and protective coverings. It has been at the heart of Danish business since then; while it no longer houses the Danish stock exchange, it serves as the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce. Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said Tuesday a \u201cpiece of Danish history\u201d was on fire, calling the building \u201cirreplaceable.\u201d Denmark\u2019s culture minister Jakob Engel-Schmidt added that 400 years of cultural heritage had been damaged. \u201cHow touching it is to see how the employees at B\u00f8rsen, good people from the emergency services and passers-by work together to rescue art treasures and iconic images from the burning building,\u201d he said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/17/style/copenhagen-stock-exchange-fire-police-investigation-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_01_china_china-change6-moon-landing-intl-hnk-scn", "text": "China\u2019s Chang\u2019e-6 lunar lander successfully touched down on the far side of the moon Sunday morning Beijing time, in a significant step for the ambitious mission that could advance the country\u2019s aspirations of putting astronauts on the moon. The Chang\u2019e-6 probe landed in the South Pole-Aitken Basin, where it will begin to collect samples from the lunar surface, the China National Space Administration announced. China\u2019s most complex robotic lunar endeavor to date, the uncrewed mission aims to return samples to Earth from the moon\u2019s far side for the first time. The landing marks the second time a mission has successfully reached the far side of the moon. China first completed that historic feat in 2019 with its Chang\u2019e-4 probe. If all goes as planned, the mission \u2014 which began on May 3 and is expected to last 53 days \u2014 could be a\u00a0key milestone in China\u2019s push to become a\u00a0dominant space power. The country\u2019s plans include landing astronauts on the moon by 2030 and building a research base at its south pole \u2013 a region believed to contain water ice. Sunday\u2019s landing comes as a growing number of countries,\u00a0including the United States, eye the strategic and scientific benefits of expanded lunar exploration in an increasingly competitive field. Samples collected by the Chang\u2019e-6 lander could provide key clues into the origin and evolution of the moon, Earth and the solar system, experts say\u00a0\u2013 while the mission itself provides important data and technical practice to advance China\u2019s lunar ambitions. Chang\u2019e-6 touched down within an impact crater known as the Apollo Basin, located within the\u00a0sprawling, roughly 2,500-kilometer-diameter South Pole-Aitken Basin, according to Chinese state media Xinhua. It had orbited the moon for about 20 days as part of a larger probe, which is composed of four parts: an orbiter, a lander, an ascender and a re-entry module. It is now expected to use a drill and a mechanical arm\u00a0to gather up to 2 kilograms of moon dust and rocks from the basin, a crater formed some 4 billion years ago. The probe will spend two days on the far side of the moon, and 14 hours to collect moon soil samples, Xinhua reported. To complete its mission, the lander will need to robotically stow those samples in an ascent vehicle that made the landing with it. The ascent vehicle will then return to lunar orbit, where it will\u00a0dock with and transfer the samples to\u00a0a re-entry capsule, according to mission information provided by the China National Space Administration. The re-entry capsule and orbiter will then travel back to Earth\u2019s orbit and separate, allowing the re-entry capsule to make its expected return later this month to the Siziwang Banner Landing Site in China\u2019s rural Inner Mongolia region. The technically complex mission is made more challenging due to where it is being conducted. The far side of the moon is out of range of normal communications, which means Chang\u2019e-6 must also rely on a satellite that was launched into lunar orbit in March, the Queqiao-2. China plans to launch\u00a0two more missions\u00a0in the Chang-e series as it nears its 2030 target of sending astronauts to the moon. Multiple nations are expanding their lunar programs, with a growing focus on securing access to resources and further deep-space exploration. Last year,\u00a0India landed\u00a0a spacecraft on the moon for the first time, while Russia\u2019s first lunar landing mission in decades ended in failure when its\u00a0Luna 25 probe crashed\u00a0into the moon\u2019s surface. In January, Japan became the fifth country to land a spacecraft on the moon, though its\u00a0Moon Sniper lander\u00a0faced power issues due to an incorrect landing angle. The following month, IM-1, a\u00a0NASA-funded mission\u00a0designed by Texas-based private firm Intuitive Machines, touched down close to the south pole. That landing \u2013 the first by a US-made spacecraft in over five decades \u2013 is among several planned commercial missions intended to explore the lunar surface before NASA attempts to return US astronauts there\u00a0as soon as 2026\u00a0and build its scientific base camp.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/01/china/china-change6-moon-landing-intl-hnk-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_28_tech_ai-iphone", "text": "Imagine asking Apple\u2019s Siri to show you an old photo taken from a child\u2019s second birthday, or summarizing lengthy emails and writing drafts. Then consider Siri learning your schedule, preferences, even your personality, so it can better communicate with you throughout the day. Generative AI, artificial intelligence that can provide thoughtful and thorough responses to questions and prompts, could potentially breathe new life into Apple\u2019s iPhone lineup at a time when competitors are threatening to leave the company behind in the race to shape what could be a world-changing technology. The company is widely expected to partner with ChatGPT maker OpenAI ahead of its annual Worldwide Developers Conference in June, where it will likely show off its first batch of AI tools coming to the iOS software. Although artificial intelligence has powered some of the iPhone\u2019s experiences for years, such as Live Text and improved autocorrect, generative AI could unlock new levels of interaction and personalization. All this during a time when the company is under pressure to catch up to rivals such as Google and Samsung, which are already using the technology in its smartphones. \u201cWe see generative AI as a key opportunity across our products and believe we have advantages that set us apart there,\u201d Apple CEO Tim Cook said on the company\u2019s most recent earnings call in early May, noting there would be news announced in the \u201cweeks ahead.\u201d Apple is not always first to adopt to emerging technologies \u2014 it typically researches, develops and aims to perfect them for years before including them in new products \u2014 but the speed at which the world is adopting generative AI is perhaps expediting the company\u2019s need to have a smartphone with the most cutting-edge technology. The debut of an AI iPhone could also entice consumers to upgrade at a time when they\u2019ve been holding onto older models longer. Apple reported first-quarter revenue of $90.8 billion, down 4% year over year, as the tech giant continues to struggle with growth challenges, particularly in China, amid an uncertain economic environment. Now all eyes shift to Apple for its take on generative AI. Here\u2019s how that could play out on the iPhone: A much smarter assissant Although it\u2019s unclear what exactly an iPhone in the generative AI world would look like, experts largely believe the biggest entrypoint is through Siri, the company\u2019s virtual assistant with a hit-or-miss track record. Integration with OpenAI\u2019s latest ChatGPT-4o model could catapult Siri years forward, essentially turning the feature into an iPhone chatbot. This would enable Siri to perform specific tasks such as recalling a picture taken years ago on the device or answering detailed questions about the weather, the news or trivia. Over time, it could learn the user\u2019s preferences and even personality, and respond accordingly. Looking at how competitors have already introduced generative tools, the iPhone will also likely assist users with other tasks, such as offering to summarize and draft emails, or starting an online purchase return process. Samsung\u2019s \u201ccircle to search\u201d feature, which allows users to quickly search for information on a device\u2019s screen with a finger gesture, has received a lot of attention and is featured in marketing campaigns. Multimodal features \u2013 which refers to an AI system that can interpret and generate different types of data, such as text and images at the same time \u2014 like analysis of video footage and in-call spam detection could also form part of the tools, according to Paul Schell, industry analyst at tech intelligence firm ABI Research. \u201cSomething similar would likely be included in an Apple offering, given its relative simplicity and appeal that goes beyond simple image search,\u201d Schell said. \u201cBut verbal interactions with a bot like Siri will be much more natural and fluent, and its capabilities will go far beyond the previous, narrow domains, like news and weather updates.\u201d An AI iPhone could also adapt automatically and seamlessly to users, based on voice, audio and natural language, along with images and contextual cues. \u201cGenerative AI will allow the next generations of iPhones to become a sixth sense, empowering us to scan and interact with the world around us,\u201d said Thomas Husson, an analyst with market research firm Forrester. Generative AI will also likely change Apple\u2019s whole ecosystem by embedding it through its own apps, such as Apple Maps, iMovie and iPhoto, and release tools for developers for brands to develop new experiences through their own apps. Expediting AI Behind the scenes, Apple reportedly has been working on its on-device generative AI capabilities and acquiring companies for awhile, such as Canadian startup DarwinAI. It also has a machine learning research division dedicated to advancing artificial intelligence.  But after the launch of ChatGPT ignited an AI arms race in late 2022, followed by companies such as Google, Microsoft and Meta heavily pouring resources into developing related tools, Apple has remained relatively quiet about its visions for an AI-powered future. Nabila Popal, a senior research director at market research firm IDC, said the pressure to be part of the conversation likely moved up the company\u2019s timeline. Earlier this month, Bloomberg reported Apple was closing in on a deal with OpenAI to use its ChatGPT technology on iPhones, after holding similar talks with Google. \u201cApple normally takes their time and doesn\u2019t let the Android race rush [impact its moves], be it with foldables or 5G or even augmented and virtual reality,\u201d Popal said. \u201cAnd Apple then comes out and does it better than anyone else.\u201d \u201cHowever this time, with AI, it is different,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like Apple is being forced to show its hand early.\u201d She said consumers are considering AI capabilities of greater importance than any other feature when choosing their premium device, especially in China, where Apple is losing its marketshare. \u201cIt\u2019s not just because of the resurgence of Huawei but also because of \u2018lack of AI\u2019 in their devices,\u201d she said. \u201cChinese consumers want more from their premium phones.\u201d During its most recent iPad event, Apple reminded onlookers that it\u2019s been using artificial intelligence in its products for years, including a neural processing engine to support its A11 bionic chip. But now it needs to show it\u2019s going all in on artificial intelligence to stay relevant in a rapidly evolving industry. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer a question about whether or not Apple will announce something around generative AI, but Apple has to if they want to achieve growth in this highly competitive and innovative smartphone market, especially in China. \u2026 AI is one train Apple can\u2019t afford to miss.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/tech/ai-iphone/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_05_31_style_princess-diana-exhibition-london-intl-scli-gbr", "text": "Some of the most unforgettable photos of Princess Diana, such as her \u201crevenge dress\u201d that broke royal protocol and her handshake with an AIDS patient that changed the way the world treated those with the illness, have gone on display in a new exhibition in London. The exhibition, which is being held at Dockside Vaults just north of London\u2019s Tower Bridge and runs from May 25 to September 2, traces Diana\u2019s life as a humanitarian, a mother and a fashion icon. It displays a carefully curated selection of work by renowned royal photographer Anwar Hussein, 85, who started snapping Diana when she was 19. \u201cAt first, some told me \u2018you can\u2019t do pictures of royals,\u2019\u201d Anwar told CNN ahead of the exhibition\u2019s launch. \u201cI said, \u2018why not? I want a change.\u2019 I was doing rock and roll pictures - Bob Marley, Elton John, The Beatles. And then I got fed up with show business.\u201d Weaving through the vault\u2019s underground network of tunnels, CNN was given a tour of the exhibition by Anwar\u2019s two sons, Samir, 45, and Zak, 43. The pair have followed in their father\u2019s footsteps to become royal photographers in their own right, snapping viral photos of younger generations of the royal family. \u201cDiana did really buck the trend, especially for royals. She changed so much, and things that are now seen as normal, such as what Kate or Meghan wear, it was really Diana that changed all of that,\u201d said Samir, standing in front of a floor-to-ceiling print of the famed \u201crevenge dress\u201d photo, taken at a Vanity Fair party on the same day that Charles publicly admitted to adultery. \u201cA lot of people didn\u2019t think she was going to come out, and then she just came out looking like a million dollars and made a really big statement that, \u2018I\u2019m not going to hide away, I\u2019m still going to be my own person,\u2019\u201d Zak added. For Anwar, it\u2019s a very different photo that stands out to him. \u201cThis was Diana\u2019s favorite,\u201d he said, looking up at a photo of Diana cradling a young cancer patient during a trip to a hospital in Lahore, Pakistan, in 1996. \u201cThe boy was blind. He smelled of all these chemicals they had been using, but she didn\u2019t care and she cuddled him,\u201d Anwar said. \u201cLater on, he died and she was very sad about that. It shows her humanitarian side.\u201d Over the years, Anwar and his sons have taken hundreds of thousands of photos of the royal family. There is one word, however, which seems to encapsulate the images on display: legacy. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want (the exhibition) to be controversial. We wanted it to be a celebration of Diana\u2019s life and her legacy,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had \u2018The Crown,\u2019 we\u2019ve had films about Diana, so it feels like there is a whole new generation experiencing it.\u201d And for Samir and Zak, their father\u2019s influence has also had a profound impact on their lives, something which is illustrated by two almost identical, yet eerily different, photos on display in another part of the exhibition. In the first photo, taken in 1992, Diana sits alone in front of the Taj Mahal in India, her red and purple suit, designed by Catherine Walker, is a pop of color against the softer backdrop of the ivory-white marble mausoleum. Anwar was told on the day of the Taj Mahal visit that Charles had other engagements, so Diana went without him, Zak says, recalling his father\u2019s recollections. \u201cShe ended up posing up in front of it, in front of this monument to love,\u201d he said. \u201cFairly soon afterwards, they announced their separation.\u201d Some 24 years later, Zak returned to the same spot to photograph Prince William and his wife, Catherine. \u201cThere was a lot of speculation. Would they recreate the picture of Diana there?\u201d Zak said. \u201cThey arrived and sat on the bench, but this time it\u2019s two people that are very much in love.\u201d In many ways, the exhibition is a love letter to two families: the Husseins behind the lens, multiple generations of royals in front of it. \u201c(Our father has) never done anything like this before,\u201d Samir said. \u201cHe\u2019s getting on now, he\u2019s a bit older and I think he really wanted to do a celebration of what he had done and a celebration of her as a person.\u201d In a statement, Anwar said: \u201cI am delighted that the images captured, as well as those of my sons, are coming home to London to recognize and memorialize such a remarkable woman and her sons.\u201d Tickets for the exhibition, which start at \u00a317 (about $22), include a 60-minute audio tour detailing the first-hand accounts behind each photograph.

{"id": "2024_05_29_china_hong-kong-47-verdict-intl-hnk", "text": "More than a dozen of\u00a0Hong Kong\u2019s leading democracy figures were found guilty Thursday on subversion charges, following the largest national security trial since Beijing\u2019s sweeping crackdown on the once free-wheeling city. The 14 activists and politicians were convicted of \u201cconspiracy to commit subversion\u201d for their roles in holding\u00a0an unofficial primary election\u00a0in 2020 to decide who should contest city lawmaker elections. They were among 47 defendants in what became known as the trial of the \u201cHong Kong 47\u201d \u2013\u00a0a closely watched, landmark prosecution under a national security law\u00a0Beijing imposed on the city in the wake of mass anti-government protests the previous year. Those on trial represented a broad swathe of Hong Kong\u2019s now dismantled democracy movement and most pleaded guilty during the prosecution process. But 16 activists and politicians decided to fight the charges, opting for a full trial which lasted for more than a year. Two were acquitted on Thursday and walked free from the court. The remaining 45 now await sentencing at a later date and could face a maximum punishment of life imprisonment. Thursday\u2019s verdict offers one of the clearest windows into how the national security law has rewritten the city\u2019s political landscape, with a once-permitted pro-democracy opposition now decimated and dissent all but erased. The Hong Kong and Beijing governments have repeatedly denied the national security law is suppressing freedoms, arguing it has ended chaos and \u201crestored stability\u201d to the city. In an executive summary outlining the convictions, a panel of judges ruled the prosecution had proved the defendants were engaged in a conspiracy to disrupt the government\u2019s \u201cduties and functions \u2026 with a view to subverting the state power.\u201d Supporters of those convicted maintain they were simply taking part in the kind of oppositional politics that was once allowed to flourish in Hong Kong, and Thursday\u2019s verdict signals China\u2019s control of the once-outspoken city is all but complete. Since the national security law came into effect in 2020, civil groups have disbanded, and independent media outlets have been shut down. The city\u2019s legislature now comprises only of pro-Beijing loyalists, while most pro-democracy figures are either in jail or in exile overseas. The 47 defendants were first arrested in dawn raids on January 6, 2021 \u2013 1,240 days ago \u2013 and most have been held in detention for more than three years. They\u00a0include seasoned politicians, elected lawmakers and young protest leaders, as well as academics, unionists, journalists and medical workers. They hail from multiple generations and a wide political spectrum - from moderate democrats to those who advocate for Hong Kong\u2019s self-determination. Among those who pleaded not guilty and were convicted on Thursday\u00a0were former journalist Gwyneth Ho, 33, who famously live-streamed an attack on pro-democracy demonstrators inside a subway station, and former lawmaker Leung Kwok-hung, 68, known by the nickname \u201cLong Hair,\u201d a left-wing activist who began his long political career campaigning against British colonial rule. Following the verdicts, some family members cried openly in the courtroom and waved to the defendants. Some defendants smiled and waved back, others looked resigned. The two acquitted were former\u00a0district councilors\u00a0Lawrence Lau\u00a0and Lee Yu-shun, who took part in the unofficial primary held by democrats in 2020. \u201cToday, I shouldn\u2019t be the focus of attention. I hope everyone will continue to pay attention to\u00a0other friends in the case,\u201d Lau, a barrister, said after he walked free from the court. \u201cThank you very much for the concern over all the defendants of this case, please, please carry on your concern and give them love.\u201d Lee, sporting a golden chain and a tiger print shirt, said he could not say much even after being acquitted. \u201cBecause the Department of Justice has indicated that it may appeal, I cannot make any comments or give any opinions on the ruling or this case at this stage.\u201d he said. \u201cSo I can only tell you that I feel very calm and thank you for your concern. Now I want to go have dimsum with my family because I haven\u2019t been able to see them yet.\u201d Hours later, the prosecutors confirmed in court they would appeal against the acquittals. Human Rights Watch condemned the convictions, arguing the democracy leaders were prosecuted for \u201cpeaceful activism\u201d and that the verdict showed \u201cutter contempt for both democratic political processes and the rule of law.\u201d A \u2018vicious plot\u2019? The case of the \u201cHong Kong 47\u201d arose from an unofficial primary election held by the pro-democracy opposition in July 2020 for the city\u2019s legislature. The goal was to narrow down their best chances for candidates to try and win a majority, much like similar polls found in other democracies around the world. But Hong Kong authorities said the primary vote was a \u201cvicious plot\u201d intended to \u201cparalyze the government and undermine state power\u201d and accused those who took part of intending to use their mandate to block legislation indiscriminately. The Legislative Council election \u2013 which the defendants had hoped to win by holding the primary vote \u2013 was postponed to 2021 due to Covid health concerns cited by the authorities during the\u00a0pandemic. During the postponement, Beijing and Hong Kong authorities rewrote the city\u2019s electoral rules, putting in place a stricter screening system to weed out candidates deemed \u201cunpatriotic.\u201d Hong Kong\u2019s Legislative Council currently has no pro-democracy lawmakers, and the upcoming district council elections, to be held in\u00a0December, also do not feature any pro-democracy candidates. In the face of a trial without jury,\u00a031 defendants pleaded guilty, a move that in Hong Kong usually leads to a reduced sentence. But that strategy is now in doubt after another local national security law enacted earlier this year curtailed access to reduced sentences for guilty pleas. Those who pleaded guilty included Joshua Wong, 27, who gained international fame as the face of Hong Kong\u2019s years of student-led democracy protests and\u00a0was labeled an \u201cextremist\u201d by China\u2019s state media, Benny Tai, 59, a former law professor and co-founder of the 2014 Occupy Central movement, and Claudia Mo, 67, a former journalist-turned-reform minded legislator. Sweeping changes Hong Kong\u2019s democracy activists are no strangers to courtrooms. Many served time for their activism. But the trial of the \u201cHong Kong 47\u201d showed how the legal system has changed under the national security law, which criminalizes secession, subversion, terrorism, and collusion with foreign powers and carries a maximum punishment of life imprisonment. Its wording, as well as its application, is more in keeping with laws in mainland China, where courts are tightly controlled by the ruling Communist Party and have a conviction rate above 99.9%. In contrast, Hong Kong follows a common law system that had been kept intact after the former British colony was handed back to Chinese rule in 1997. Nearly 300 people, aged between 15 and 90, have been arrested under the Beijing-imposed national security law since it was enacted, according to police. Like all national security cases so far, the trial of the Hong Kong 47 was heard without a jury, deviating from the common law tradition, a power granted by the Beijing-imposed law. It was also presided over by a bench of three High Court Judges designated by the city\u2019s Chief Executive to handle national security cases. The law also places a higher threshold for bail. Thirty-two defendants have been denied bail and have been in detention since 2021 \u2013 a highly unusual practice for cases that do not involve murder. Only 15 were granted bail, but two of them had their application revoked later for breaching bail conditions. The trial brought the imposition of mainland legal concepts, mainland law into the common law system into sharp relief, said John Burns, emeritus professor at the University of Hong Kong. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely clear that the national security law reduced the independence and the autonomy of the judiciary. No juries, much more difficult to get bail \u2013 those are all things that previously were determined by the judges.\u201d Legal scholars\u00a0and Western governments have lamented how the national security law has dealt a blow to the city\u2019s\u00a0judicial independence, but authorities in Beijing and Hong Kong have warned foreign parties against interfering in the city\u2019s internal affairs and judicial system. Before the trial began in February, the Hong Kong government called criticism on the trial \u201cscandalizing of the criminal justice process\u201d and \u201ca blatant act undermining the rule of law of Hong Kong.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/china/hong-kong-47-verdict-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_31_style_helicopter-photographer-donn-delson", "text": "\u201cThis is not daredevil stuff,\u201d says 75-year-old fine art photographer Donn Delson as we sit in a helicopter with no door, almost 2,000 feet above London. At this height, the winds are numbing even in May, yet Delson, on the outermost seat, dangles his legs out as a diminutive Big Ben and Tower Bridge pass by beneath us. \u201cOn a good day I\u2019ll go out on the (skid),\u201d he says rather nonchalantly, referring to the two nail-bitingly thin helicopter landing bars beneath us. \u201cBut harnessed up, of course, and only when we\u2019re hovering.\u201d While many may turn green at the thought of hanging out of a door-less helicopter, this is the desired set up for Delson \u2014 who refuses to put his camera lens anywhere near a window. \u201cIt\u2019s really the only way I want to shoot,\u201d he said, back on the ground the following day, of his penchant for working at height. \u201cI do everything on a large scale, because I want people to get the feeling I have when I\u2019m up there.\u201d The feeling, as it appeared sitting next to Delson in that same sky-high \u2018copter, is one of complete calmness. Mid-flight, he grumbles at the fierce winds and asks the pilot to slow the aircraft down to a hover. Suddenly we\u2019re suspended \u2014 wobbling in the air somewhere above the river Thames (a designated heli-lane intended to spare the rest of the city in the event of a crash) as Delson reaches under his headset to remove the black cap worn backwards on his head. \u201cMuch better,\u201d he says, and gives the signal to fly on. Delson, who is based in Los Angeles, began his career as an aerial photographer almost a decade ago. He\u2019s since spent over 300 hours in a helicopter, capturing everything from the ephemeral cherry blossoms of Japan to rugged mountain trails hidden in the Red Sea \u2014 sometimes from as high as 12,000 feet. His preference to charter private helicopters, which costs him between $800 and $2,500 per hour, is made possible by the fact that this is his 9th career. \u201cI\u2019ve been fortunate to have been an entrepreneur most of my life, and be successful in my business activities,\u201d Delson told CNN. After selling his last company BandMerch \u2014 one of the largest entertainment merchandise businesses in the world with Rihanna, Outkast and Billy Joel as his clientele \u2014 Delson was able to retire, briefly, before a chance holiday excursion set him on a new path. \u201cWe were on a trip to New Zealand, and my wife and I had the opportunity to go up in a helicopter to see a glacier,\u201d he said. The pilot, noticing a hefty camera strapped around Delson, offered to open the door in order to let him shoot out unencumbered. \u201cMy wife said no. I said, \u2018Sounds fabulous.\u2019\u201d There\u2019s an uncanniness to looking down at the world from above. The usual markers of your street-level experience have vanished, as has everyone else in the world. It\u2019s quiet and still. If there wasn\u2019t the looming anxiety of a potential helicopter malfunction, it might even be peaceful. Delson\u2019s work leans into this strange, disembodied feeling by capturing scenes that trick the eye. A parking lot filled with cargo containers that look like musical bars on a xylophone; or the Red Sea\u2019s sprawling canyons and gullies that could be the branches of an ancient tree. \u201cThe French term trompe l\u2019oeil was used by painters whose paintings were so lifelike you\u2019d think it\u2019s a picture. I want to make audiences rethink assumptions about what they\u2019re seeing.\u201d There\u2019s no guarantee Delson will get one of these illusionary shots, however. In Japan, the photographer spent between 20 and 25 hours in the air over the course of a week \u2014 in Israel, he flew for a combined 36 hours. But sometimes he won\u2019t take a single picture. \u201cIt\u2019s a risk,\u201d Delson said. \u201cI have no idea when I go up whether or not I\u2019m going to find anything.\u201d Even if he returns empty-handed, Delson believes there is more to be gained from the experience than simply making new work. \u201cI\u2019m definitely different than before I started flying,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cI\u2019ve always considered myself to be a fairly spiritual person, but the perspective that one gets when you have the opportunity to do these things is transformative.\u201d Journeying back to the office at ground level, London seems a lot smaller. Just a few hours before, the capital was an intimidating, sprawling metropolis home to almost 9 million people. Now it feels almost bijou. The London Eye, what I considered to be the vertiginous pinnacle of the city at 10 years old, now feels laughably miniature; nothing more than a hamster wheel.\u00a0 Even Canary Wharf struggles to seem as imposing once you\u2019ve seen 50-storey landmark One Canada Square from 1,200 feet, shrunken to the size of a Lego brick. \u201cThe world from above, it\u2019s just so different from the world we know,\u201d said Delson. For any newcomers or tourists, struggling with the numerous skyscrapers, boroughs, tube lines or zone demarcations \u2014 try stepping into a helicopter. The result is a city that feels much more manageable.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/style/helicopter-photographer-donn-delson/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_05_25_uk_alderney-british-island-nazi-atrocities-intl-gbr", "text": "Alderney, a quiet British island in the English Channel known for its outstanding natural beauty, was once the site of the only Nazi camps\u00a0on British soil \u2013 and a hell on Earth for its thousands of inmates. A fresh inquiry, ordered by the UK\u2019s Special Envoy for Post Holocaust Issues,\u00a0Eric\u00a0Pickles, and led by a panel of experts, has sought to determine the exact death toll of prisoners and\u00a0laborers\u00a0on Alderney, while also bringing an end to the conspiracy theories and misinformation surrounding the island. The findings were published on Wednesday and determined there were a greater number of deaths than initially documented following liberation, but found no evidence of a \u201cmini-Auschwitz.\u201d The inquiry also explored why the Nazi perpetrators \u2013 most of whom evaded justice \u2013 never stood trial in Britain. Stretching for three square miles, the island was occupied by the Nazis for most of World War II. During that time, three forced\u00a0labor\u00a0camps and a concentration camp called Lager Sylt were built. Nearly eight decades later, the fingerprints of Nazi occupation are still visible on the picturesque island, including bunkers, anti-tank walls and the notorious Water Lane tunnels constructed by the occupying forces to store munitions and fuel. According to its tourist board, the residents of Alderney \u2013 which has a population of just over 2,000 \u2013 gather once a year in May for a memorial service to commemorate the island\u2019s victims. Described by Pickles as housing the \u201cmost westerly concentration camp in the Third Reich,\u201d questions over the scale of horror that occurred on the island have persisted among locals as well as internationally \u2013 and the exact number of dead has never been clear, until now. The Channel Islands were the only British land the Germans occupied during World\u00a0War II.\u00a0Unlike Jersey and Guernsey \u2013 the other Nazi-occupied islands \u2013 Alderney was evacuated of nearly all of its residents, meaning the island does not have extensive war-time records. According to Pickles, the lack of records has led to unsubstantiated claims being made about Alderney and the war crimes that took place there. \u201cClaims of mass murder that anywhere else would be checked carefully have been accepted at face value,\u201d\u00a0Pickles \u2013 who has stressed the importance of historic accuracy regarding the Holocaust \u2013 said. \u201cThird- or fourth-hand testimonies of atrocities, without any supporting evidence, are given as a\u00a0fact\u2026 What\u00a0happened on Alderney was bad enough with its brutality, sadism and murder, without the need for embellishment.\u201d \u2018Unvarnished truth\u2019 Following the island\u2019s liberation from the Nazis, official figures from a post-war investigation put the death toll at 389. This figure has long been disputed. Historians, members of the Jewish community and members of the public have estimates ranging from hundreds to several thousand. Speculation has also been rife that the true scale of what happened on the island may have been deliberately concealed by the British government. The inquiry denies such theories. It found that the number of deaths in Alderney is unlikely to have exceeded 1,134, with a more likely range of deaths being between 641 and 1,027. In addition, at least 97 people died and one disappeared during transit to and from the island. The estimated minimum number of prisoners or\u00a0laborers\u00a0sent to Alderney throughout the German occupation stands between 7,608 and 7,812, the panel found. Alderney\u2019s camps, according to the inquiry, shared many of the traits of those in mainland Europe.\u00a0Laborers\u00a0were kept in atrocious conditions and forced to work long hours carrying out dangerous construction work. They were subject to beatings, maiming,\u00a0torture and\u00a0in some cases executions. The inquiry found that there is \u201cno evidence\u201d for arguing that many thousands of victims died. Assertions that Alderney housed an extermination center and constituted a\u00a0\u201cmini-Auschwitz\u201d\u00a0are also untrue, the panel found. \u201cPrisoners were treated appallingly, and life was cheap, but Alderney did not house a \u2018mini-Auschwitz\u2019; there was no extermination centre on the island,\u201d\u00a0Pickles said. He added, \u201cAnyone who claims so has never visited Auschwitz or understood the extent of the Nazi\u2019s death factories in Eastern Europe.\u201d Pickles believes overestimated death tolls at the hands of the Nazis can be damaging and play into the hands of Holocaust deniers. \u201cAt a time when parts of Europe are seeking to rinse their history through the Holocaust, the British Isles must tell the unvarnished truth,\u201d he\u00a0said. \u201cNumbers do matter. It is as much of a Holocaust distortion to exaggerate the number of deaths as it is to underplay the numbers.\u201d He added, \u201cExaggeration plays into the hands of Holocaust deniers and undermines the six million dead. The truth can never harm us.\u201d \u2018Egregious injustice\u2019 A separate section of the inquiry focused on the failure to prosecute war crimes committed in Alderney, something that it described as an \u201cegregious injustice.\u201d This was due to the British government\u2019s decision to hand the case over to the Soviet Union after World\u00a0War II\u00a0as the majority of victims were Soviet citizens. Research conducted by Anthony Glees, an academic\u00a0and adviser to Pickles,\u00a0found there had been a \u201csuccession of cover-ups\u201d on the part of the British government, which handed all Alderney\u2019s files of evidence over to the Soviet Union via the United Nations War Crimes commission on September 12, 1945. From there, the USSR decided to \u201cdo nothing with the evidence,\u201d according to Glees, meaning that the majority of perpetrators who had systematically tortured and in some cases murdered their victims escaped trial. Glees believes that this has deliberately been hidden from public view by the British government. He is calling on the government to issue an apology. \u201cIt seems scarcely understandable that Britain, of all countries, declined to try Nazi war criminals for appalling atrocities committed on British soil against citizens of some 30 nations,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead, the British authorities passed all the evidence that they had carefully collected in the so-called \u2018Alderney Case\u2019 to the\u00a0USSR\u2026\u00a0despite the USSR not having requested it and so, apparently, directly contravening Britain\u2019s international treaty obligations.\u201d According to Glee, the lack of trials of Alderney\u2019s war criminals has meant that justice was denied to victims and their families. Pickles, meanwhile, said the fact that the perpetrators never faced British justice is a \u201cstain on the reputations of successive British governments.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/uk/alderney-british-island-nazi-atrocities-intl-gbr/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "world"}}

During a speech Friday, Biden said Hamas had been degraded to a point where it can no longer carry out the type of attack seen on October 7 that launched the current war. Part of the agreement, he said, would see a truce and hostage exchange while Israel and Hamas negotiate a permanent end to the fighting. It was perhaps the furthest Biden has gone in telling Israel its stated goals for its operation in Gaza\u00a0have\u00a0been met, and that the time has\u00a0arrived to stop the fighting. The proposal has been welcomed across the international community. The UN, the UK, France, Saudi Arabia and the UAE have all expressed support for Biden\u2019s proposal, while Qatar and Egypt joined the US in calling on Israel and Hamas to \u201cfinalize\u201d the proposed ceasefire agreement. For its part, Hamas said it viewed the plan \u201cpositively\u201d and is ready \u201cto deal positively and constructively with any proposal based on a permanent ceasefire.\u201d But a statement from the Israeli Prime Minister\u2019s Office on Saturday said Israel\u2019s goals \u2014 \u201cthe destruction of Hamas military and governing capabilities, the freeing of all hostages and ensuring that Gaza no longer poses a threat to Israel\u201d \u2014 would need to be met before a permanent ceasefire can begin. \u201cUnder the proposal, Israel will continue to insist these conditions are met before a permanent ceasefire is put in place. The notion that Israel will agree to a permanent ceasefire before these conditions are fulfilled is a non-starter,\u201d the statement said. Saturday\u2019s statement largely reiterated earlier comments from the Israeli Prime Minister\u2019s Office (PMO) made less than an hour after Biden detailed the peace proposal on Friday, with Netanyahu insisting the country would not end the war until Hamas is defeated and all hostages had been returned. For all the messaging, however, it is unclear exactly to what degree Israel supports the plan. The earlier PMO statement insisted the \u201cexact outline\u201d of the proposal allows Israel to \u201cmaintain\u201d its goals in the conflict. The Israeli online newspaper The Times of Israel said that Netanyahu\u2019s statement on Saturday was geared towards outlining what kind of ceasefire agreement Israel is prepared to agree to, rather than ruling one out. Domestic pressure mounts for Netanyahu Netanyahu is facing domestic pressure, both from opposition leaders to get a ceasefire agreement on the table, and from ministers within his own party not to back down on Israel\u2019s original war goals. Families of Israelis being held hostage are meanwhile urging him to accept the proposal. Protesters took to the streets of several cities across Israel on Saturday, demanding Netanyahu\u2019s resignation and for early elections to be held. They also demanded the release of all hostages held in Gaza and for the Israeli government to accept the latest proposal laid out by Biden. Families of hostages held in Gaza took part in protests in Tel Aviv, Caesaria, Haifa, Herzeliya, Kfar Saba. At Hostage Square in Tel Aviv, protesters called the names of the 125 hostages still in Hamas captivity. \u201cStart streaming this deal, so that it will start moving\u2026 Start working, start acting,\u201d a woman in Tel Aviv shouted over a loudspeaker. In Caesarea, protesters called for Netanyahu to accept the hostage release deal that Biden presented. \u201cThere is no victory until every last hostage is returned,\u201d people chanted. Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid wrote on X Saturday that Israel\u2019s government \u201ccannot ignore President Biden\u2019s significant speech.\u201d Lapid said he was offering\u00a0Netanyahu a \u201csafety net,\u201d saying he would support\u00a0him\u00a0in securing a hostage deal if far-right ministers Itamar Ben Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich left the government. Gvir, Israel\u2019s National Security Minister, had previously threatened to leave\u00a0Netanyahu\u2019s coalition if a ceasefire is reached before Israel achieves its declared war aims. Also in his speech on Saturday, Biden alluded to the tensions in the Israeli government, making a direct appeal to ordinary\u00a0Israelis\u00a0to voice their support for a hostage agreement that would result in a ceasefire. \u201cI know there are those in Israel who will not agree with this plan and will call for the war to continue indefinitely. Some, some are even in the government coalition,\u201d he said. The international pressure Netanyahu\u2019s government is facing to end the war in Gaza has also been mounting, as the conflict approaches its ninth month. The war was triggered by Hamas attacks on Israeli civilians on October 7, which left around 1,200 people dead and saw more than 200 people taken hostage. The Israeli campaign in Gaza since then has killed more than 36,000 people. Fighting continues. This week, the Israeli military confirmed that it was operating in the centre of Rafah, southern Gaza, while a top Israeli security official warned the conflict could last into next year.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/01/europe/netenyahu-ceasefire-hamas-contradiction-biden-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "world"}}

Pickton is one of the most notorious serial killers in Canadian history, bringing his victims to  his pig farm and feeding their remains to his animals. The 74-year-old had been serving a life sentence at Port-Cartier Institution in Canada\u2019s Quebec province after being convicted for six counts of second-degree murder in 2007. He sustained injuries from an assault involving another inmate on May 19 and died in hospital Friday, Correctional Service Canada (CSC) said. Pickton\u2019s next of kin has been notified and registered victims have also been contacted, CSC added, who said an investigation was underway. At least 65 women disappeared from Vancouver\u2019s Downtown Eastside neighborhood in British Colombia province between 1978 and 2001 before Pickton was arrested. Pickton had been operating a pig farm in the nearby city of Port Coquitlam, where police found the remains of 33 women. However, Pickton confessed to murdering 49 women when talking to an undercover police officer in a jail cell. The case became the largest serial killer investigation in Canada\u2019s history and Pickton\u2019s pig farm became the largest crime scene in Canadian history, with investigators taking 200,000 DNA samples. Many of his victims were indigenous women, with police accused of not taking their cases seriously as many of those missing were prostitutes or drug addicts. In its release, CSC said, \u201cWe are mindful that this offender\u2019s case has had a devastating impact on communities in British Columbia and across the country, including Indigenous peoples, victims and their families. Our thoughts are with them.\u201d The news brought mixed emotions to the families of Pickton\u2019s victims. Cynthia Cardinal, whose sister Georgina Papin was murdered by Pickton, told Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail that she was \u201creally happy,\u201d but noted that she was \u201creally sad\u201d some families did not have their cases heard in court. Michele Pineault, the mother of Stephanie Lane, who was killed at age 20 but whose death Pickton was not charged for, told the newspaper that she was \u201celated\u201d by the death of \u201cthis animal\u201d as \u201cthere was no justice\u201d for her daughter. In 2016, a book allegedly written by Pickton and smuggled out of prison was published and offered for sale on Amazon but was quickly withdrawn following a public backlash.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/01/americas/serial-killer-robert-pickton-dies-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "world"}}

Biles is looking to claim a record-extending ninth all-around victory at the national championships \u2013 the final event for US gymnasts before the Olympic Trials in late June. Biles\u2019 fellow all-around Olympic champion Suni Lee\u00a0finished in fourth place Friday,\u00a0while reigning Olympic floor champion Jade Carey\u00a0finished in eighth place. The women\u2019s team to compete at Paris 2024 will be chosen after the Olympic Trials, with the winner of the all-around competition at the Trials automatically making the team. If Biles can qualify for her third Olympic Games, she will return to the competition where, three years ago, she experienced the \u201ctwisties\u201d \u2013 a mental block causing gymnasts to lose track of their body positions \u2013 and had to withdraw from several events. Meanwhile, Brody Malone ended the first day of the men\u2019s competition with a comfortable lead, ahead of Fred Richard and Maksim Kan. The 2022 high bar world champion was competing in his first all-around event since suffering a serious knee injury on that apparatus in March 2023 and sits in a strong position going into the final day of competition on Saturday. How to watch the competition\u2019s conclusion The men\u2019s competition continues on Saturday at 6 p.m. ET while the women next take to the arena on Sunday at 6:45 p.m. ET. All podium training sessions will be available to watch on\u00a0FlipNow.tv\u00a0\u2013 USA Gymnastics\u2019 streaming service \u2013 while Peacock,\u00a0NBC\u00a0and CNBC will broadcast the main sessions. Viewers outside the US can also follow the event on the USA Gymnastics YouTube channel.

{"id": "2024_05_29_asia_chinese-ships-japan-senkaku-islands-intl-hnk-ml", "text": "China Coast Guard ships have been in waters around Japanese-controlled islands in the East China Sea for a record 158 consecutive days, according to Tokyo\u2019s latest count released Monday, surpassing the previous record set in 2021. Analysts fear the uninhabited islands, known as the Senkakus in Japan and the Diaoyus in China, have the potential to become a flashpoint for conflict between the two Asian neighbors. \u201cThe Japanese government takes very seriously the fact that there have been a succession of vessels sailing in the contiguous zone and trespassing in territorial waters,\u201d Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said at a Monday briefing in Tokyo. The Japanese government\u2019s chief spokesperson did not say how often Chinese ships entered Japan\u2019s territorial waters, though foreign ships are allowed \u201cinnocent passage\u201d through such waters. A contiguous zone extends another 12 nautical miles beyond a country\u2019s territorial waters, the area that stretches 12 nautical miles from the shore. Foreign warships are allowed into contiguous zone waters \u2013 so the Chinese Coast Guard hasn\u2019t broken any international agreements \u2013 but the continuous presence of the Chinese vessels there is seen as a provocation. Hayashi said Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has raised Tokyo\u2019s \u201cserious concerns\u201d with Chinese Premier Li Qiang during a trilateral summit with South Korea in Seoul on Monday. \u201cWe will continue to take every possible precaution and surveillance around the Senkaku Islands with a sense of urgency,\u201d he said. Competing claims The uninhabited island chain has been a sore spot in Japan-China relations for years. Claims over the rocky chain, 1,200 miles (1,900 kilometers) southwest of Tokyo but only about 205 miles (330 kilometers) from China\u2019s east coast, date back centuries, and neither Japan nor China is likely to back down over territory considered a national birthright in both capitals. Tensions heated up in 2012, after Tokyo bought some of the islands from a private Japanese owner, which Beijing took as a direct challenge to its sovereignty claims. It has frequently dispatched China Coast Guard and other government vessels to the waters around the islands to assert those claims. \u201cDiaoyu Dao and its affiliated islands are China\u2019s inherent territory,\u201d Beijing\u2019s foreign ministry said. \u201cIt is legal and reasonable for our Coast Guard to conduct normal patrols in waters administered by China.\u201d Experts have said China makes a statement and sets up a possible legal argument for sovereignty over the islands by keeping government ships near them. To present an international legal claim to the islands over Japan, \u201cChina simply needs to establish a greater and more enduring presence of its ships in the waters around the islands,\u201d James Brown, an associate professor of political science at Temple University in Tokyo, told CNN in 2022. Hayashi, the Japanese government spokesperson, said Monday that Tokyo is answering the Chinese presence around the islands with vessels of its own. \u201cWe ensure a comprehensive security system for territorial waters by deploying Coast Guard patrol vessels that are consistently superior to other party\u2019s capacity,\u201d Hayashi said. Any Japanese-Chinese incident in the Senkakus raises the risk of a wider conflict, analysts note, due to Japan\u2019s mutual defense treaty with the United States. Washington has made clear on numerous occasions that it considers the Senkakus to be covered by the pact. China exerts pressure at sea The extended Chinese presence around the Senkakus comes as Chinese forces assert themselves in two other East Asian hotspots \u2013 around Taiwan and near Philippines-controlled features in the South China Sea. China staged its largest military exercises this year around Taiwan last week after the island\u2019s new democratically elected leader, President Lai Ching-te, who is openly loathed by Beijing for championing the island\u2019s sovereignty and distinct identity, was sworn in. China\u2019s ruling Communist Party says Taiwan is part of its territory, despite never having controlled it, and has vowed to take the island, by force if necessary. And in the South China Sea, the China Coast Guard has been taking action against Philippine vessels trying to resupply a contingent of Philippine marines on Second Thomas Shoal, using water cannons that have injured Filipino sailors and damaged their craft. The developments come as leaders and military officials prepare to gather in Singapore for the Shangri-La Dialogue, Asia\u2019s premier defense summit. Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. is scheduled to give the keynote speech Friday evening, with Chinese-Philippine clashes around Second Thomas Shoal expected to be a prime topic. The US and Chinese defense chiefs are also expected to address the conference. CNN\u2019s Himari Semans contributed to this report.

Snapped while taking a stroll in New York City, the model, writer and actor was seen wearing a graphic T-shirt printed with Stormy Daniels face (Daniels is the adult film star and director who was allegedly paid $130,000 by Trump to keep quiet about an affair ahead of the 2016 election). The\u00a0$95 shirt\u00a0was designed by cartoonist Robert Crumb\u00a0and,\u00a0according to the brand Platform, directly supports the New York based domestic violence and sexual assault organization, \u201cSafe Horizon,\u201d\u00a0by donating a\u00a0portion of its sales. Fashion has long been an important vehicle for political expression, particularly for those in the spotlight. In 1984, British designer Katherine Hammett\u00a0became an early proponent of politically charged T-shirts, when she arrived to meet then British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in a top that read \u201c58% don\u2019t want Pershing\u201d \u2014 a phrase lifted from an\u00a0opinion poll on the undemocratic proliferation of American nuclear missiles across Europe. Hammett later told the Guardian in 2018 she hid the top tightly under her jacket, only exposing the words when she was in front of a wall of cameras. Thatcher bent down to read her shirt and \u201clet out a squawk,\u201d Hammett said. Today, statements can range from the enigmatic to the undeniable. Ratajkowski herself is no stranger to the art of sartorial support, wearing a\u00a0conspicuous\u00a0Rage Against the Machine\u00a0T-shirt\u00a0in 2020\u00a0featuring a young Bernie Sanders. However in 2017,\u00a0while delivering a televised speech on Brexit legislation, the late Queen Elizabeth II \u2014 well versed in the semiotics of clothing \u2014\u00a0wore\u00a0a blue and yellow floral hat\u00a0that many\u00a0interpreted\u00a0as subtle\u00a0homage to the EU flag. Similarly, at the\u00a0Cannes Film Festival\u00a0earlier this month, many online questioned whether Cate Blanchett\u2019s Haider Ackermann dress was a tacit show of solidarity with Palestine amid the war in Gaza. The silk satin haute couture gown was half black and half blush-toned pink, with a striking emerald green lining only visible when she tossed her frock open. In an image captured by an elevated photographer, the pastel pink in Blanchett\u2019s gown appeared\u00a0almost\u00a0white \u2014 a combination of colors, especially considering the red carpet of the Promenade de la Croisette, was enough for some to\u00a0perceive\u00a0as a nod to the\u00a0de\u00a0facto\u00a0Palestinian\u00a0flag. Neither Blanchett nor Ackermann (who made the dress in January 2023,\u00a0some\u00a09 months before the October 7 attacks) issued an official statement on the dress. But in the digital age,\u00a0explicit displays of support are sometimes at risk of being censored. On Wednesday,\u00a0Vanity Fair France issued an apology\u00a0after\u00a0it was revealed that\u00a0the magazine had edited out a Palestinian pin worn by actor Guy Pearce during a photoshoot. \u201cAs the Palestinian people are already suffering great trauma and loss due to the vengeful regime of Netanyahu it is most unfortunate that a reputable publication like VF attempts to eliminate support that I or anyone chooses to offer,\u201d Pearce told CNN in an emailed statement. \u201cPersonally I think it is a disgrace.\u201d Hammett believes the quality of modern protest T-shirts have diminished to \u201cwatered-down messages,\u201d and while there is no striking statistic\u00a0or slogan\u00a0on Ratajkowski\u2019s top,\u00a0there\u2019s poetry in her choice of design.\u00a0Daniels, whose claims were long underestimated because of her career as a sex worker, refused to be pressured by a powerful man into silence. Similarly, Ratajkowski has spoken at length in her 2021 book \u201cMy Body\u201d about her experience enduring several instances of sexual assault. \u201cMy position brought me in close proximity to wealth and power and brought me some autonomy, but it hasn\u2019t resulted in true empowerment,\u201d wrote Ratajkowski in the opening to her book. \u201cThat\u2019s something I\u2019ve gained only now, having written these essays and given voice to what I\u2019ve thought and experienced.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/style/emily-ratajkowski-stormy-daniels-sartorial-support/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_31_europe_donald-trump-conviction-european-allies-reaction-intl", "text": "European allies of former US President Donald Trump have rallied around him in support following his historic conviction on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. The conviction \u2013 which has been heralded as a somber moment for America with wide-reaching implications \u2013 has been painted by Trump\u2019s allies in Europe as political persecution, aimed at derailing his bid to return to White House. Italy\u2019s Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini called Trump\u2019s conviction \u201cjudicial harassment\u201d in a post on X, while Hungarian President Viktor Orban urged him to \u201ckeep on fighting\u201d for the presidency. But other countries declined to comment on the development \u2013 a conventional response for governments when asked about another nation\u2019s domestic matters. A Manhattan jury\u00a0found Trump guilty\u00a0of all 34 charges\u00a0of falsifying business records on Thursday, an unprecedented verdict that makes\u00a0him the first former president in American history to be convicted of a felony. The\u00a0verdict\u00a0was announced after jurors deliberated for nearly 12 hours over two days. It will ultimately be up to voters in November to decide the significance of the guilty verdict delivered by 12 ordinary New Yorkers, which, on a legal basis, does not prevent him from being elected president again. Salvini, who is a long-time supporter of the former president and visited him in Philadelphia,\u00a0Pennsylvania during his first presidential campaign, said Trump was a \u201cvictim of judicial harassment and a process of political nature.\u201d He wrote on X that \u201cin Italy, we are sadly familiar with the weaponization of the justice system by the left,\u201d which he said has for years tried to \u201celiminate political opponents through legal means.\u201d \u201cI hope Trump wins; it would be a guarantee of greater balance and hope for world peace,\u201d he added. Orb\u00e1n said he knew Trump to be \u201ca man of honour.\u201d \u201cAs president, he always put America first, he commanded respect around the world and used this respect to build peace,\u201d he said Friday in a\u00a0post\u00a0on \u2018X\u2019. \u201cLet the people make their verdict this November! Keep on fighting, Mr. President!\u201d he added. Meanwhile, Russia suggested there was a political conspiracy at play, despite Trump being convicted by a jury. \u201cIn general, if we talk about Trump, it is obvious that political rivals are being eliminated there through all legal and illegal means,\u201d President Vladimir Putin\u2019s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said in a daily call to journalists. \u201cThis is visible to the whole world with the naked eye.\u201d Other countries, sticking to protocol, declined to comment on Trump\u2019s conviction. Asked in a press briefing Friday whether he would potentially be willing to work with a convicted felon, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak avoided the question, stating that his focus was \u201csquarely on the election here at home, talking to people across the country about the choice at our election.\u201d Germany\u2019s Foreign Office spokesperson Christian Wagner, meanwhile, told journalists in a daily briefing: \u201cWe do not comment on this.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/europe/donald-trump-conviction-european-allies-reaction-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_31_weather_power-grid-outages-us-texas-climate", "text": "Picture this: It\u2019s a Thursday night in Houston and thunderstorms are rolling in. Suddenly, winds roar past 100 mph. Trees snap, windows shatter and the city darkens as power flickers out. Even after it\u2019s over, it takes days for the lights to come back on in parts of the city. A week and a half later, the Tuesday morning commute is just getting underway in Dallas. Thunderstorms rush through the city, unleashing hurricane-strength wind gusts and torrential rain. Trees and power lines topple to the ground, cutting power to hundreds of thousands of people. Many homes and businesses remain without power days later. That\u2019s exactly the scenario that played out in Texas over the past few weeks, and these kinds of outages are happening more frequently as destructive extreme weather thrashes the aging electric grid. From 2000 to 2023, 80% of all major US power outages were due to weather, according to analysis by Climate Central, a non-profit research group. The number of weather-related outages from 2014 to 2023 doubled compared to outages at the start of the century. Being without power is not only expensive \u2013 keeping people out of work and school, and keeping businesses closed \u2013 it\u2019s dangerous. There doesn\u2019t need to be a heat wave in Texas for summertime temperatures to soar to unhealthy levels. Heat is particularly dangerous without A/C at night, which is when the body needs to cool itself after a hot day. Experts say there could be ways to keep the lights on in the face of extreme conditions, even if there\u2019s no single perfect solution. Why can\u2019t the lights stay on? Power generation, transmission and distribution within the US happens on a power grid, an interconnected series of power plants, power lines and electrical substations. But the grid\u2019s infrastructure is aging fast and struggling to keep up with modern power demands, according to the US Department of Energy. It\u2019s also struggling as extreme weather gets more intense as the planet warms. \u201cOur (power) infrastructure was built for the weather of the past,\u201d Michael Webber, a professor of engineering at the University of Texas said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t built for the weather of the future, and the weather of the future is already here.\u201d A majority of the US electric grid was built in the 1960s and 1970s, but some of the first parts of the system were constructed in the early 1900s. And 70% of transmission lines in the US are approaching the end of their 50- to 80-year lifecycles, according to the DOE. Every element within the power grid is vulnerable in some way to extreme weather, Webber told CNN. Power is largely distributed by above-ground power lines from large transmission towers to smaller \u2013 and abundant \u2013 power poles. Most outages happen because of failures with power lines and poles, making them a \u201cbig weakness\u201d in the overall system, according to Webber. Severe weather \u2013 defined as thunderstorms, high winds, heavy rain and tornadoes \u2013 was far and away the main cause of weather-related major outages at 58%, according to Climate Central. And it directly impacts these exposed lines. Power lines and poles can be brought down by falling tree limbs, topple over in fierce winds and be snapped by heavy ice. Extreme events, like the derecho and tornado that tore through the Houston in mid-May, can turn massive transmission towers into mangled metal. Hurricanes, like 2021\u2019s Ida, inflict damage at a colossal scale. When infrastructure can\u2019t withstand extreme weather, it not only disrupts power, it also creates its own disasters: The massive Smokehouse Creek Fire ignited earlier this year after a \u201cdecayed\u201d power pole toppled in strong winds, according to a report from the Texas House of Representatives. But it\u2019s not just power lines and power poles under attack from extreme weather; the things that generate power can also take a beating. Blasts of frigid cold can freeze necessary equipment, leaving it unable to keep up with demand. Historic cold shuttered power plants and froze non-winterized wind turbines in Texas in 2021. The resulting power outages were vast and deadly in the brutal cold. Meanwhile, searing heat sends electricity demands skyrocketing as cooling needs surge. If power needs cannot be met, blackouts and brownouts arise. Equipment also overheats and fails if temperatures soar too high. Modernized equipment can keep the A/C running \u2013 for a price In order to keep power flowing during extreme weather, or restore it quickly in the aftermath, the US grid needs to be upgraded and fortified on a vast scale. It will cost trillions of dollars to do this well, according to Webber. Power poles, power lines and transmission equipment need to be built or rebuilt stronger and operate at a higher capacity to keep larger amounts of power flowing, even when demand spikes. At the most basic level, a wooden power pole is less durable and has a shorter lifespan than a metal pole. Installing sturdy, metal poles means more stay upright in extreme weather, but they could come at an environmental cost, given how energy intensive it is to make steel. Fortified power lines above ground will still sometimes be knocked over by violent storms, so another solution is to put power lines underground. Parts of the US are already doing this, including cities like Anaheim, California, and Fort Collins, Colorado. But burying electricity isn\u2019t perfect solution, either. Running power lines underground is often 10 times more expensive than building overhead wires, and the lines are susceptible to flooding and can be difficult for crews to service, according to Rob Gramlich, founder and president of Grid Strategies, a power grid consulting firm. Modernization of outdated power lines costs around $100,000 per mile, while new power lines can run anywhere from $1 million to $10 million per mile depending on geography and whether they are above or underground, according to Webber. But it\u2019s an investment that will pay for itself when fewer power lines spark devastating wildfires or outages that cost up to billions of dollars are avoided, Webber contends. A stronger grid also has to have smarter controls to rapidly reroute power where it\u2019s needed when outages do occur. \u201cAny number of things can happen to power generation in any one area,\u201d Gramlich told CNN. \u201cBut if you have fortified inter-regional transmission, you have an insurance policy against many risks.\u201d The US is designed so that if power needs in one region spike because of increased demand or power generation fails, another region steps in to help handle the load. Renewable energy sources like solar and wind make the grid more resilient by diversifying the number of ways power is generated if another method fails. But, the energy generated by renewable means is still delivered via the same vulnerable infrastructure as all other power. It may be an insurmountable task to eliminate weather-related power outages completely, but it should be possible to eradicate major, multi-day outages. \u201cUltimately, I think it really should be extremely rare to have a multi-day power outage,\u201d Gramlich said. \u201cWe can plan the whole electricity system so that never happens.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/weather/power-grid-outages-us-texas-climate/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_28_middleeast_israeli-tanks-advance-central-rafah-gaza-intl", "text": "Israel\u2019s tanks were seen in central Rafah on Tuesday for the first time since its military entered Gaza\u2019s southernmost city earlier this month, two eyewitnesses told CNN, signaling a new phase in its offensive despite mounting global pressure. They arrive two days after a strike on a Rafah camp killed dozens of displaced Palestinians on Sunday and as the international community urges Israel to stop its assault on the city. Israeli strikes over the past two days in Rafah have forced more displaced people to flee. Two further attacks in Rafah killed at least 29\u00a0Palestinians on Tuesday,\u00a0according to authorities in Gaza. The first hit a displacement camp just 150 meters from the site of Sunday\u2019s strike. The second hit\u00a0a displacement camp\u00a0in the southern coastal town of Al-Mawasi, an area designated by Israel as a \u201csafe zone\u201d where it had earlier ordered thousands of people to evacuate to. Israel has denied striking a humanitarian area in Al-Mawasi. Staunch ally the United States said President Joe Biden is not altering his policy toward Israel, suggesting the strikes had not yet crossed\u00a0a red line\u00a0that would force changes in American support. White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby asserted on Tuesday there were no indications yet that Israel had waged a military campaign that would prompt Biden to withhold aid or weapons. Biden had said in a CNN interview earlier this month\u00a0that he wouldn\u2019t allow certain US weapons to be\u00a0used in a major offensive in Rafah. His administration has warned against a large-scale ground invasion in Rafah unless the well-being of civilians can be guaranteed. Some 1.3 million Palestinians were sheltering in Rafah before Israel began its operation there, having fled from other parts of Gaza since the conflict began seven months ago. Around 1 million have fled the city since, according to UN figures. Israel\u2019s advance deeper into Rafah comes despite the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ordering it to \u201cimmediately halt\u201d its military operation there. The UN and some of Israel\u2019s European allies have called on it to abide by the ICJ\u2019s order, saying it is binding. In Khan Younis, north of\u00a0Rafah, people attempting to evacuate told CNN they do not know where else to go as they try to head north toward Deir El-Balah in central Gaza. Video shows mattresses, wooden panels, chairs, and various other belongings piled on top of vehicles and donkey carts. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening now, whether in\u00a0Rafah, Khan Younis or Gaza in general, is the disastrous displacement of people. There is no shelter, no life, no future,\u201d said Ansar Mahdi, a Palestinian who said she has now been displaced four times. Walking on crutches, Mohamed Jarbou, said: \u201cThe elderly have been humiliated. Children humiliated. What\u2019s wrong? They are all civilians.\u201d Tanks in Rafah Alaa Abu Ibrahim, a Rafah resident, told CNN that Israeli tanks were seen at the Al Awda roundabout in the center of the city. Another resident, Salma AlKadoomi, said she saw armored vehicles in the downtown area. \u201cThese vehicles advanced in the middle of the night,\u201d AlKadoomi told CNN. Asked about reports of tanks advancing in the city, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari told a media briefing on Tuesday that the military is operating in Rafah in a \u201ctargeted\u201d and \u201cprecise\u201d way. \u201cThere are still Hamas battalions in Rafah. A couple of days ago launchers from Rafah fired (rockets) to Tel Aviv. Millions of people went into bomb shelters,\u201d he said. Israel began a limited ground operation in Rafah on May 7, crossing the Philadelphi Corridor \u2013 a 14-kilometer (about 8.7-mile) buffer zone on the Egypt-Gaza border \u2013 and seizing the Palestinian side of the border with Egypt. Egypt has strongly opposed the operation at its border. On Monday, an Egyptian security worker was killed on the border with Gaza in a shooting that involved Egyptian and Israeli soldiers. Egypt\u2019s state-affiliated Al-Qahera News outlet said \u201cPalestinian resistance\u201d fighters were also involved. Displacement camps hit again: Palestinian officials Palestinian officials said Tuesday\u2019s fresh Israeli strikes had killed 29 people \u2013 at least eight at the Tal al-Sultan camp and 21 at a camp\u00a0in Al-Mawasi, though the IDF has denied striking a humanitarian area in Al-Mawasi. CNN has followed up, asking if the IDF has struck elsewhere in Al-Mawasi, such as the UN warehouse that is in the vicinity of the camp, but has not received a reply. The first strike hit three tents at Tal al-Sultan at around 3 a.m. local time, according to residents and a CNN stringer in Rafah. At least eight people were\u00a0killed and transferred to a field hospital in Tal al-Sultan, according to the Emergency Committee of the Rafah Governorate. CNN has reached out to the IDF for comment on the strike at Tal al-Sultan. The camp hit on Tuesday is approximately 150 meters from another displacement\u00a0camp where an Israeli strike and ensuing fire on Sunday killed at least 45 people. Video from CNN\u2019s stringer in Tal al-Sultan shows displaced people dismantling their makeshift living arrangements, gathering their belongings and evacuating the area on trucks and donkey carts. Al-Mawasi, north of Rafah, is supposedly a \u201csafe zone.\u201d In early May, the Israeli military ordered people in eastern Rafah to \u201cimmediately head to the expanded humanitarian area in Al-Mawasi,\u201d as it stepped up its operations in the area. The Al-Mawasi camp was already crowded with displaced people before civilians in Rafah were ordered to move there. The UN has said it is not \u201cquite suitable\u201d for habitation. Videos obtained by CNN show several dead bodies lying on sand covered in bloodied blankets with dozens of people shrieking and gathering around them.

{"id": "2024_05_29_middleeast_israel-gaza-war-seven-months-end-year-intl", "text": "The war in Gaza will likely continue through at least the end of the year, an Israeli official warned Wednesday, seeming to dismiss the idea that fighting would end after the military offensive against Hamas in Rafah. Israel\u2019s national security adviser, Tzachi Hanegbi, said the year 2024 has been \u201cdefined as a year of combat\u201d by Israel\u2019s war cabinet. \u201cWe are now in the fifth month of 2024, which means we expect another seven months of fighting to deepen our achievements and achieve our goal of destroying the military and governmental capabilities of Hamas and Islamic Jihad,\u201d Hanegbi said. The comments came as Israeli tanks \u2013 seen Tuesday in central Rafah for the first time since the operation began earlier this month \u2013 continued to probe the southern Gaza city on Wednesday, despite mounting global pressure to stop the offensive. The Israeli government had previously signaled that entering Rafah would be the final stage of its war against Hamas, which attacked Israel on October 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking some 250 people hostage. In response, Israel launched a devastating offensive in Gaza which has killed more than 36,000 people, according to Palestinian officials. Despite the prospect earlier this month of striking a ceasefire-for-hostages deal with Hamas, the more extreme wing of Israel\u2019s war cabinet had urged that the Rafah offensive go ahead, arguing that destroying the group was more urgent and of greater importance than returning the hostages believed to still be alive in Gaza. But Hanegbi\u2019s comments suggest that the Rafah operation may not mark the end of hostilities, raising questions about Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s plans to wind down Israel\u2019s campaign and his plans for the post-war governance of Gaza. While Netanyahu has portrayed Rafah as Hamas\u2019 \u201clast bastion\u201d his forces have been operating in northern areas the military previously said it dismantled the militants\u2019 command structure. In a radio interview on the Israeli station Reshet Bet, Hanegbi said \u201cit was honestly stated in the first days of presenting the plans to the cabinet that the war would be long.\u201d \u201cYou need to have patience and know how to stand strong. This resilience is what has allowed this nation to survive for 75 years, and even for 3,000 years before that. Just don\u2019t use a stopwatch on ourselves or set ultimatums,\u201d he said. Israel is pressing ahead with its military offensive in the face of growing global outrage, after an Israeli airstrike on Sunday killed at least 45 people and injured 200 others in Rafah at a camp for displaced people, which Israel had designated as a safe zone. Video from the Tal al-Sultan camp showed scenes of horror: charred bodies being pulled from the rubble, a man holding the headless body of a child, fire raging from tents in the background. A CNN analysis of video from the scene suggests that munitions made in the United States were used in the strike. But US President Joe Biden is not altering his policy towards Israel, suggesting the strike on Rafah had not yet crossed a red line that would force changes in American support, despite him telling CNN earlier this month he would not allow certain US weapons to be used in a major offensive in Rafah. The strike came days after the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ordered Israel to \u201cimmediately halt\u201d its offensive in Rafah, or any actions \u201cwhich may inflict on the Palestinian group in Gaza conditions of life that could bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part.\u201d The ICJ said the humanitarian situation in Rafah can now be described as \u201cdisastrous\u201d and could worsen still if Israel\u2019s operation in the city continues.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/middleeast/israel-gaza-war-seven-months-end-year-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_29_africa_south-africa-elections-polls-open-intl", "text": "Millions of South Africans are voting in what is expected to be the most pivotal general election since the end of apartheid. For months, polls have shown the ruling African National Congress (ANC) party could lose its majority for the first time since Nelson Mandela led it to power in 1994. While polling can be challenging in South Africa, most analysts believe that the ANC faces its stiffest challenge yet with a population deeply frustrated by the country\u2019s direction. If support for the ANC drops below 50% for the first time, the party will be forced to enter into a coalition government. ANC leader and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa called Wednesday\u2019s vote \u201cone of the most important elections in our nation\u2019s history,\u201d while addressing a crowd of thousands at Soweto\u2019s FNB soccer stadium on Saturday. \u201cOur people will decide whether our country continues moving forward with the ANC towards a better, brighter future or backwards to a terrible past,\u201d Ramaphosa said. The South African leader, who cast his ballot at a polling station in Soweto, told reporters on Wednesday that he has \u201cno doubt whatsoever\u201d that voters will again trust in the ANC. \u201cThis is the day when South Africa decides, decides on the future of our country, (on) who should lead the government of South Africa, and I have no doubt whatsoever in my heart of hearts that the people will once again invest confidence in the African National Congress to continue to lead this country,\u201d Ramaphosa\u00a0said. South Africa is the most unequal country in the world, according to the World Bank. Citizens are also contending with the highest sustained rate of unemployment in the world, rampant corruption, feeble economic growth, crippling power cuts and\u00a0rising violent crime. Black South Africans, who make up 81% of the population, are at the sharp end of this dire situation. Unemployment and poverty remain concentrated in the Black majority, in large part due to the\u00a0failure of public schooling, while most White South Africans have jobs and command considerably higher wages. Voters in Johannesburg told CNN they headed to vote shortly after polls opened at 7 a.m. local time (1 a.m. ET) on Wednesday, and many expressed their hopes that the country would move in a different direction. \u201cWe want to see the change,\u201d said Sydney Radebe. \u201cThis is a rich country but people don\u2019t have anything,\u201d the 66-year-old actor and filmmaker added. \u201cWe don\u2019t have land, we don\u2019t have property\u2026 you cannot own nothing and say you are \u2018free.\u2019\u201d Radebe was among the first early morning voters at one of the biggest polling stations in Johannesburg. On a crisp morning as the Southern Hemisphere heads into winter, the line of voters gradually began to grow inside Joubert Park. Events worker Newton Ugboh, 20, was voting for the first time. \u201cI\u2019m looking for change so I came early in the morning,\u201d he said. Ugboh said that some of his friends didn\u2019t want to vote as \u201cthey think things aren\u2019t going to change at all,\u201d but that there are \u201cbig issues\u201d facing young people in the country. The \u201cunemployment rate is crazy,\u201d he said, adding that it\u2019s a \u201cbig-time struggle to find work, most of my friends are unemployed.\u201d Healthcare worker Roselyne Tswakae, 46, said she\u2019s worried about the future of South Africa\u2019s youth and also believes \u201cit\u2019s time for change.\u201d \u201cYoung South Africans were promised that education would be the key to success, they went to university but they are unemployed and often end up getting involved in drugs, drinking, smoking,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are hoping for the light,\u201d Tswakae added. Land surveyor David Ngobeni, 31, also said \u201cthere isn\u2019t much hope\u201d for young people in South Africa. He says unemployment, inflation, crime and corruption are the \u201cbig issues facing everyone right now.\u201d \u201cIf you have a job, you are very lucky,\u201d Ngobeni told CNN. He added that he hopes the outcome of this election will lead to inflation going down and boost the economy. At the very end of a long line in Joubert Park was 40-year-old Ncumisa Xabanisa. She said she has been voting for the same party since 1994 and is very loyal to the ANC. \u201cit\u2019s only one party for me, it\u2019s from home, it\u2019s from my grandmother, I grew up knowing them,\u201d Xabanisa told CNN. She said the major problem the country is facing is a lack of jobs. \u201cSome of us we went to school, we graduated but we have the certificates like it\u2019s a display. It\u2019s hurting.\u201d The mother-of-two added that she is educated but is currently sitting at home most of the time, and sells plastic food containers to make a living. There are 52 parties on this election\u2019s national ballot, including new parties formed by previous ANC members such as former President Jacob Zuma\u2019s uMkhonto weSizwe Party (MK). Zuma was forced to\u00a0resign as president in 2018\u00a0and served a brief stint in jail in 2021 for contempt of court. The 82-year-old was barred from running for parliament last week after the country\u2019s Constitutional Court ruled that five years must have elapsed since the completion of his sentence. However, his party will still contest the election and his face will remain on the ballot. Capping off a heated few months of election campaigning, many of the largest parties held their final rallies this weekend, including the Democratic Alliance (DA), the official opposition party. \u201cOn Wednesday, the ANC will lose the outright majority it has abused for decades to subject the people of this country to unemployment, corruption and misrule\u2026 we close the ANC chapter of our history,\u201d DA leader John Steenhuisen told supporters in the town of Benoni, east of Johannesburg. The DA has formed a coalition bloc with smaller opposition parties called the Multi-Party Charter. This is the seventh general election South Africa has held since the end of white minority rule 30 years ago. A record 27.79 million people are registered to vote \u2013 the highest number to date, according to the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC.) The country\u2019s electoral commission (IEC) said that, by 11 a.m. in South Africa, a \u201csignificant majority\u201d of voters had already cast their ballots, as lines to vote had formed before the polls opened. \u201cThis, we think, is testament to the enthusiasm of South Africans to record their political choice,\u201d the IEC\u2019s deputy CEO Masego Sheburi added during a briefing at the National Results Center. Sheburi said that some voting stations opened late, but by midday \u201cgood progress\u201d was made with \u201cminimal incidences\u201d across the country. One of the issues some polling stations faced was late delivery of ballot papers, mainly in the Johannesburg area, according to the IEC.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/africa/south-africa-elections-polls-open-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_30_middleeast_aid-gaza-down-two-thirds-israel-intl", "text": "The amount of humanitarian aid entering Gaza has dropped by 67% since Israel launched a military offensive in the southern city of Rafah earlier this month, the United Nations has warned. \u201cThe amount of food and other aid entering Gaza, already insufficient to meet the soaring needs, has further shrunk since May 7,\u201d the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said Wednesday. A daily average of 58 aid trucks reached Gaza between May 7 and Tuesday, down from an average of 176 aid trucks between April 1 and May 6, OCHA said, a drop of 67%. About 500 trucks per day crossed into Gaza before hostilities between Israel and Hamas began in October, according to figures from the UN, which has long urged that deliveries return to this level. The drop in aid deliveries came after Israel began its assault on Rafah in its attempt to destroy Hamas, which was believed to have regrouped in the south of Gaza after Israel\u2019s destruction of much of the north. Since Israel seized control of the Gazan side of the Rafah crossing on May 7, aid has been blocked, with supplies piling up in Egypt and the Strip teetering close to famine. A top Israeli security official this week warned that the war in Gaza could spill into next year, apparently dashing the possibility that the Rafah campaign could bring the offensive to an end. In its ruling last week, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) said the humanitarian situation in Gaza could now be described as \u201cdisastrous\u201d and ordered Israel to keep the Rafah crossing open for \u201cunhindered provision at scale\u201d of aid. Israel and Egypt have blamed each other for the blockage. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz called on Egypt to reopen the crossing; his Egyptian counterpart Sameh Shoukry accused Katz of \u201cdistorting the facts,\u201d saying that Israel\u2019s offensive near the crossing \u2013 and the danger it poses to relief workers \u2013 was the reason Egypt is unable to bring aid into Gaza. Rafah had previously been the central artery for aid to flow into Gaza \u2013 and, in November, for some injured Palestinians and foreign nationals to enter Egypt. With Rafah now the epicenter of hostilities, aid has continued to trickle in from two other crossings: Kerem Shalom in the south and Erez in the north. Kerem Shalom was reopened last week after Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi and US President Joe Biden agreed to send aid to the UN via the crossing on a temporary basis. \u201cThis will help save lives,\u201d Biden said, while efforts continue to reopen the Rafah crossing. More than 370 aid trucks arrived at the crossing from Egypt on Monday, Israeli officials said. But UNRWA, the main United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, said it had picked up only 30 trucks for distribution on the Gazan side of the crossing. \u201cWhile the Kerem Shalom crossing remains open in principle, it is extremely difficult for aid organizations to access from the Gaza side due to the hostilities,\u201d OCHA said Tuesday. Some Israelis have in recent months staged protests at the crossing, demanding that no aid enter Gaza until Hamas release all of the hostages. In the north, some aid has been able to enter via the Erez crossing. From May 1 to May 20, the World Food Program transferred 500 trucks, carrying 7,000 metric tons of aid, through the crossing. But only the western side of the crossing is open, with Erez East still closed. Meanwhile, the temporary US-built pier to transport aid into Gaza, which cost $320 million and only began operating on May 17, broke apart Tuesday. It will be removed from the Gaza coast and taken to the Israeli port of Ashdod for repairs, which will take more than a week.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/middleeast/aid-gaza-down-two-thirds-israel-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "world"}}

Leading up to the tournament Korda \u2013 chasing a seventh win of the year \u2013 was the overwhelming favorite to win what would have been her second major of 2024, having enjoyed a scintillating start to the season. However, an opening round 10-over 80 followed by a par score of 70 in the second ended any chance of competing further at Lancaster Country Club in Pennsylvania. The American finished two shots adrift of the eight-over cut. Birdies on the sixth, seventh, and eighth holes Friday gave hope that Korda could make the cut after an awful start to the tournament, but a bogey on the par-four ninth gave her too much to do. She ended the day with a bogey on the par-four 18th. Speaking to reporters, Korda said: \u201cI knew it was going to be a tough day \u2026 Try to give it my all, you know that\u2019s what I try to do with every round. I had nothing to lose, and that was my mentality \u2013 just kind of go for it.\u201d Earlier in the week, Thompson had announced she would retire from professional golf at the end of this season.

{"id": "2024_05_31_africa_south-africa-election-results-intl", "text": "South Africa\u2019s ruling African National Congress party is set to fall short of a majority\u00a0for the first time in 30 years after national elections this week, marking the biggest political shift in the country since the end of apartheid. With counting nearly complete support for the ANC was at just over 40%, a huge slump from the 57.5% it received in the last election. The official opposition party, the centrist Democratic Alliance (DA), had about 22% of the vote. Behind them were two ANC splinter parties: the newly formed uMkhonto weSizwe Party (MK), led by Zuma, had nearly 15% of the vote, and the far-left Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) had nearly 10%, data from the country\u2019s electoral commission showed. Fed-up voters\u00a0dealt the party of Nelson Mandela a seismic blow at the polls after\u00a0years of corruption scandals and economic mismanagement.\u00a0\u00a0As a result,\u00a0the ANC will be forced to form a coalition to govern\u00a0the world\u2019s most unequal country. Cyril Ramaphosa, the president of South Africa and the ANC \u2013 and once Mandela\u2019s favorite to succeed him as leader \u2013 promised a \u201cnew dawn\u201d when he took over in 2018 from disgraced former president Jacob Zuma. But many feel those promises never\u00a0materialized\u00a0and the\u00a0election\u00a0results reflect\u00a0a population deeply frustrated with the country\u2019s direction. South Africans could now face weeks of political uncertainty, as the ANC seeks to strike a coalition deal with former rivals. The\u00a0rebuke to the ANC\u00a0was hardly unexpected,\u00a0mirroring widespread dissatisfaction with the ruling party.\u00a0But the scale of the losses surprised some. \u201cWhat we have seen is voters are unhappy with the ANC\u2019s recent history. In particular\u00a0what happened in the Zuma years and what followed on from that,\u201d analyst and former ANC MP Melanie Verwoerd told CNN. There has been \u201ca general arrogance and loss of connection with the general voter from the ANC side,\u201d Verwoerd said, adding that parties like MK and the EFF have capitalized on\u00a0that discontent. Zuma \u2013 a fierce critic of Ramaphosa \u2013 was forced to\u00a0resign as leader in 2018\u00a0and served a brief stint in jail in 2021 for contempt of court.\u00a0The Constitutional Court barred the\u00a082-year-old\u00a0\u00a0from running for parliament\u00a0in May, but\u00a0his face remained on the MK party ballot. ANC in uncharted territory Substantial bargaining will likely begin once the final results are declared.\u00a0Political parties will have two weeks to form a coalition government before a new parliament must convene to elect the nation\u2019s president.\u00a0If they fail, new elections will need to be held. \u201cI have no sympathy for Mr. Ramaphosa and his party,\u201d DA leader John Steenhuisen told CNN during an interview at the election\u2019s National Results Center. \u201cIt is their spinelessness to deal with the prospect of Mr. Zuma and his sins of omission and commission that has led to him being a political force now that has come and wiped them out in places like KwaZulu-Natal and other parts of the country.\u201d The populous coastal eastern province of KwaZulu-Natal, where the major city of Durban is located, has traditionally been a stronghold of the conservative Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP). Zuma has faced\u00a0hundreds of corruption, fraud and racketeering charges\u00a0over the years. He has always denied all of them and became known as the \u201cTeflon President\u201d because few politicians could have survived the scandals he has faced and weathered. Analysts CNN spoke to, including Verwoerd,\u00a0believe the most likely coalition is between the ANC and DA. But others are more sceptical of that outcome.\u00a0They all agree that the country is in uncharted territory. Steenhuisen told CNN he wants to be part of a governing coalition and he believes a coalition \u201ccan work.\u201d Before\u00a0the election, the DA had already formed a\u00a0bloc with smaller opposition parties called the Multi-Party Charter. What he labels a \u201cdoomsday coalition\u201d is one of the other options on the table: a deal between the ANC-EFF\u00a0or\u00a0even\u00a0the\u00a0MK. But with such disdain inside those breakaway parties for\u00a0Ramaphosa, it would be quite some negotiation. The EFF is led by\u00a0former ANC youth leader Julius Malema. It espouses the expropriation of land without compensation and sweeping state nationalism.\u00a0The MK party\u2019s manifesto\u00a0holds\u00a0broadly\u00a0similar ideas and demands\u00a0an overhaul of the country\u2019s constitution\u00a0to restore more powers to traditional leaders. Not since the dawn of democracy in 1994 has South Africa\u2019s political landscape been so unclear. But\u00a0some analysts believe \u2013 despite the uncertainty \u2013\u00a0that\u00a0the results of this election could be a win for democracy. \u201cIt\u00a0is probably a maturity in the democracy, we needed change and it is never good to have such a one-party dominance in a country,\u201d Verwoerd said. \u201cIt might be a little bit more unstable as we go into the future. But for\u00a0democracy\u2019s\u00a0sake, it is most probably a good thing.\u201d She said that the ANC\u2019s prospects dropped dramatically under the previous president. \u201cOnce the Jacob Zuma years happened, it became pretty inevitable that there was going to be a slide,\u201d she added. A country going backwards The ANC swept to power in 1994 on a\u00a0pledge\u00a0to \u201cbuild a better life for all,\u201d winning almost 63% of the vote in the country\u2019s first democratic election. Fast forward three decades and rampant corruption, soaring joblessness, crippling\u00a0power cuts,\u00a0and feeble economic growth are severely impacting South Africans. The economy has gone backward over the past decade, evidenced by a sharp fall in living standards. According to the\u00a0World Bank, gross domestic product per capita has fallen from a peak in 2011, leaving the average South African 23% poorer. South Africa has the highest rate of unemployment in the world, according to\u00a0the\u00a0World Bank. \u00a0Inequality is also the world\u2019s worst. Black South Africans, who make up 81% of the population, are at the sharp end of this dire situation. Unemployment and poverty remain concentrated in the Black majority, in large part due to the\u00a0failure of public schooling, while most White South Africans have jobs and command considerably higher wages. Any coalition government will\u00a0be a bitter pill to swallow for the ANC and Ramaphosa,\u00a0who could soon be fighting for his political life. Leading analysts believe that the ANC was depending on its legacy too much. \u201cThe ANC was campaigning on three decades of its existence. But nobody was looking at the current president,\u201d said TK Pooe, a senior lecturer at Wits School of Governance in Johannesburg. He believes Ramaphosa is \u201cunder pressure\u201d. \u201cHistorically, it is an embarrassment for him. He always styles himself as the next Nelson Mandela,\u201d Pooe told CNN. But \u201clast recollection, Nelson Mandela never lost an election.\u201d Pooe said, with this election, voters have told the ANC three things: \u201cjobs, jobs, jobs.\u201d Whether a coalition government can deliver for the people is deeply uncertain, but one thing is clear:\u00a0South Africa and the ANC \u2013 Mandela\u2019s former liberation movement that triumphed over apartheid \u2013 will never be the same.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/africa/south-africa-election-results-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "world"}}

The 2024 No. 1 draft pick scored 11 points as the Indiana Fever defeated the Chicago Sky 71-70 in a closely-fought game that hovered on a knife edge until the very last moments when\u00a0the Sky\u2019s Marina Mabrey missed a crucial free throw. While Clark\u2019s normally laser-sharp shooting was blunted in this game \u2013 she scored six points less than her average of 17.6 points \u2013 Indiana was able to defend its slender lead and hold off a late flurry from Chicago in the opening encounter of the\u00a02024 Commissioner\u2019s Cup, the WNBA\u2019s annual in-season tournament. Clark also added eight rebounds and six assists in a well-rounded performance. After the crucial win, the rookie joined New York Liberty star Sabrina Ionescu as the only WNBA players with at least 150 points, 50 rebounds, and 50 assists in their first 10 career games. But it was far from an individual effort with Clark\u2019s teammates helping lift the Fever to their first home win of the season. All of Indiana\u2019s starters scored in double digits in the big game. The story continues Saturday\u2019s game was the latest chapter in one of the most intriguing individual rivalries in sports.\u00a0Reese was the subject of much scrutiny after\u00a0she was seen taunting Clark\u00a0following her LSU team\u2019s defeat of Clark\u2019s University of Iowa in the 2023 NCAA championship game, though Clark herself was\u00a0quick to defend Reese\u2019s actions. A year later, Clark and Iowa got a measure of revenge by\u00a0defeating Reese and LSU\u00a0in the Elite Eight of the 2024 NCAA tournament. While the rivalry between Clark and Reese was the major talking point around the game, there was a tense moment late in the third quarter elsewhere. Chicago guard Chennedy Carter was called for a dead ball foul after throwing a shoulder into Clark\u2019s back during a stoppage in play, knocking the Fever star to the hardwood. Another highly touted rookie also featured as Kamilla Cardoso made her WNBA debut Saturday. Cardoso scored 11 points and pulled down six rebounds for the Sky in her first action since being named the 2024 NCAA women\u2019s tournament most outstanding player. Cardoso was key in leading the University of South Carolina to the national championship and was the third overall pick in this year\u2019s WNBA draft for Chicago. A sellout crowd of 17,274 fans were in attendance at Gainbridge Fieldhouse to watch the much-anticipated matchup.\u00a0The Fever\u2019s attendance through the first five home games of this season has already surpassed the team\u2019s entire 20-game home schedule in 2023, according to ESPN\u2019s broadcast.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/01/sport/caitlin-clark-angel-reese-fever-sky-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "world"}}

India\u2019s election is the world\u2019s largest, a mammoth exercise in democracy that has taken place over six weeks. The final day of voting takes place on Saturday and results will be announced three days later. Modi will visit the Vivekananda Rock Memorial in Kanyakumari, a pilgrimage site off India\u2019s southernmost tip, from May 30 to June 1, according to Indian state broadcaster DD News. The site is where popular Hindu monk and philosopher Swami Vivekananda attained enlightenment. Modi has twice before ended an election campaign with meditation. But he has recently been making increasingly grand displays of piety, to capitalize on Hindu-nationalist sentiment as he eyes a third consecutive five-year term in power. In an interview last week with local news channel NDTV, Modi said: \u201cI\u2019m convinced that God has sent me for a purpose, and when that purpose is finished, my work will be done.\u201d \u201cGod doesn\u2019t reveal his cards. He just keeps making me do things,\u201d he continued. India is constitutionally bound to secularism, but since assuming power in 2014 Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have promoted a strident brand of Hindu nationalism that has deepened religious divides. When he first contested national elections a decade ago, Modi chose India\u2019s spiritual capital Varanasi as his constituency, making the ancient city the perfect backdrop to meld his religious and political ambitions. At the end of that campaign, Modi visited Pratapgad in the western state of Maharashtra, where the Hindu-led Maratha forces won a historic battle against the Mughal empire army in the 17th century. Toward the end of the 2019 national elections, which he also won, Modi went to meditate in the revered Kedarnath shrine dedicated to Hindu deity Lord Shiva high in the Himalayas. In January, just months before campaigning began, Modi consecrated the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya, a controversial Hindu temple that was built on the site of a destroyed mosque, taking on a role typically reserved for priests. In a country where about 80% of the population are followers of the polytheistic faith, critics say Modi\u2019s brandishing of Hinduism has led to rising Islamophobia and persecution of the country\u2019s more than 200 million Muslims. Modi and the\u00a0BJP have increasingly resorted to overtly Islamophobic language during his recent election speeches. In a controversial speech last month, Modi said that if the opposition wins, they would distribute the country\u2019s wealth among \u201cinfiltrators\u201d and \u201cthose who have more children,\u201d in apparent reference to the Muslim community.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/india/india-narendra-modi-meditation-island-election-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_25_europe_putin-peace-ukraine-russia-analysis-intl", "text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s\u00a0signaling this week that he is open to peace talks should be viewed with vast, overshadowing caveats, and the weight of Ukraine\u2019s - and the West\u2019s - past experience of Russian diplomacy. Friday saw a wealth of noise about negotiation, in\u00a0the same month\u00a0Moscow launched a third invasion of Ukraine from the north of Kharkiv. The\u00a0Reuters\u00a0news agency\u00a0cited four sources, in a report from two deeply experienced and connected Russia reporters, that Moscow was willing to consider peace talks which would freeze the current Russian occupation of about a fifth of Ukraine. Putin responded\u00a0to that report\u00a0by\u00a0suggesting Russia was willing to talk peace, based on earlier agreements. He hinted at an aborted deal in Istanbul, just after the war began, in 2022, which fell apart, mostly because Moscow\u2019s forces were still rampaging across Ukrainian territory, and massacres around Kyiv had come to light. The idea floated in the Reuters report would stop short of Moscow\u2019s stated goal of capturing all of eastern Donetsk, but also eradicate Kyiv\u2019s insistence it should not surrender any territory. The context of Putin\u2019s remarks was\u00a0key. They came during a visit to Belarus\u2019 President Alexander Lukashenko - something which in the past\u00a0occurred moments before the Kremlin\u00a0used\u00a0Belarusian territory for military moves into Ukraine,\u00a0while on\u00a0Friday\u00a0took place\u00a0during joint tactical nuclear weapons drills between the two countries.\u00a0Putin was talking peace with a backdrop that was anything but. Putin\u00a0questioned\u00a0the\u00a0legitimacy of Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelensky,\u00a0who\u00a0Moscow has repeatedly assailed, after Kyiv had to delay elections because of the very war Putin started.\u00a0At the same time, there were unconfirmed reports that the private jet of former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich had landed in Belarus.\u00a0The\u00a0pro-Russian Yanukovich fled Ukraine in 2014 after forces loyal to him shot dead dozens of protestors in central Kyiv. The mere possibility of his presence while Putin and Lukashenko met led to speculation Moscow was again hoping to engineer the return of a proxy to power in Ukraine. The Kremlin\u2019s less brutal goal in Ukraine \u2013 short of full or partial occupation \u2013 has involved a president in Kyiv it considers loyal, who will stop the country\u2019s march towards the European Union and NATO. It was fanciful before the 2022 invasion, and came up during the aborted 2022 Istanbul talks. But now it would likely need an occupying Russian force to impose it on a population seething at the Kremlin\u2019s brutality. So why the talk of peace, particularly when Russia appears to be having its most successful moment on the frontlines in months, if not since the invasion? Diplomacy has always been a military tool for the Kremlin. It talked peace over Syria in 2015, as their jets\u00a0pounded\u00a0civilians in rebel-held areas. It talked peace in 2015 with Ukraine, while Russian troops and their proxies were in the throes of a full assault against the strategic Ukrainian town of Debaltseve. It is not cynical to distrust Russia\u2019s sincerity when it negotiates, but a practical necessity. Experience shows it considers talks worth pursuing in case they unexpectedly produce a useful outcome without violence, or give their opponent cause for pause in fighting to try and encourage a deal. Moscow may also be talking peace again now for two reasons. Firstly, Ukraine and its allies are convening a peace summit in Switzerland in June, where it will discuss, without Russia, what sort of deal it might accept. It is likely aimed at building momentum for an off-ramp the Kremlin can take when its forces are finally militarily exhausted or in a stalemate. Zelensky has said he hopes China - Russia\u2019s most potent ally but only partial supporter in the Ukraine war - will attend. Putin may be talking peace now to suggest to Beijing to not be involved in diplomacy about Russia without Russia present. There is little serious chance the Switzerland summit will end the war, but it might concretize minds in the West as to how serious a threat Moscow poses to an actual peace deal by laying out the bones of what damage Ukraine might have to absorb to its territorial integrity to stop the bloodshed. Ukraine\u2019s\u00a0Foreign\u00a0Minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said Friday\u00a0that\u00a0Putin\u2019s hints at peace talks were directly aimed at sabotaging the summit. \u201cPutin currently has no desire to end his aggression against Ukraine\u201d, he wrote on\u00a0X, adding \u201cthis is why he is so afraid of\u201d the Switzerland summit. Secondly, and most importantly, Putin is messaging governments in the West and the current American presidential campaign. He is trying to opaquely suggest \u2013 perhaps to populists in Europe, or MAGA Republicans in the United States \u2013 that a simple deal is in hand, one in which frontlines, on which Ukraine is currently losing with significant casualties, can suddenly freeze. Western support for the war is costly, and increasingly unpopular \u2013 although the recent $61 billion passed by Congress has perhaps given the issue a\u00a0reprieve\u00a0from being at the mercy of electoral opinion\u00a0for about a year. The Reuters report permits those in the West who want to see an end to the war to believe the Kremlin could stop the war, as it stands, immediately. Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov made the report sound like it reflected Russia\u2019s permanent position. But ultimately it may sound new and interesting to key Western figures: Donald Trump - who has failed to explain how he would enact his claim he could stop the war in 24 hours \u2013 and other NATO members who are less bullish than France, the UK and the Baltic states, about the need to never trust Russia at the negotiating table. Putin is a pragmatist. He started the war thinking it would be easy. He continued it thinking his tolerance for pain, autocratic security, and patience for victory would triumph. He might be right, just now. He now sees a moment of electoral weakness in the US, and other European states, which he has met with a vague, opaque signal that there might be a time for diplomacy. It will likely gain some traction among those who desperately hope the war in Ukraine will just go away, and who are less mindful of the existential threat a victorious and hyper-militarized Moscow poses to NATO\u2019s eastern members. But it should be viewed through the lens of the deep cynicism of Moscow\u2019s earlier diplomacy in Syria and Ukraine: used as a time to ferociously pursue the same military objectives, but with the illusory backdrop that peace might be just around the corner.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/europe/putin-peace-ukraine-russia-analysis-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_01_middleeast_what-seven-months-of-war-mean-for-israel-hamas-mime-intl", "text": "Israel has warned that its war in Gaza could extend until the end of the year. National Security Adviser Tzachi Hanegbi stated on Wednesday that the country anticipates \u201cseven more months of fighting\u201d to achieve its objective of destroying Hamas, a goal that remains unmet after more than seven months of conflict. Prolonging the war could have catastrophic consequences for Palestinians in the already ravaged territory and significant repercussions for Israel and beyond, experts said. It could further harm Israel\u2019s economy, influence its domestic politics, and damage its international standing and foreign relations.\u00a0It could also impact US politics, particularly as President Joe Biden gears up for the November elections. \u201cIt\u2019s a grueling grind forward,\u201d said Assaf Orion, a senior research fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) in Tel Aviv and former head of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) strategic planning division. \u201cWe see the day-in, day-out toll of that kind of fighting\u2026 On top of that, there is of course the political, diplomatic, informational and reputational issues, in which Israel is paying growing costs for the ongoing fight.\u201d Here\u2019s what seven more months of war could mean. More suffering for Palestinians The situation is deteriorating by the day inside Gaza and a continuation of the war is likely to significantly increase the suffering of the people there. In February, when the death toll in the territory stood at 28,000, researchers from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) and the Johns Hopkins Center for Humanitarian Health projected that if the war escalated the total number of deaths would surpass 72,000 by August. If the impact of epidemics sparked by the conflict is included, the toll could be close to 86,000 by then. Aid agencies have warned that civilians in Gaza are suffering from famine in parts of the enclave and that more airstrikes and more displacement in the south of the strip are only compounding the humanitarian crisis. Delivering much-needed aid into the territory is incredibly difficult. The amount of humanitarian aid entering Gaza dropped by 67% after Israel launched its military offensive in Rafah earlier in May, the United Nations warned this week. \u201cWe once again call for a ceasefire and the release of all hostages,\u201d said Juliette Touma, director of communications at the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA). \u201cThe longer this war goes on the more there is suffering for Israeli and Palestinian civilians.\u201d Netanyahu\u2019s fate Experts suggest that both Hamas and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu see benefits in prolonging the war, as their political survival depends on it. A post-war scenario is unlikely to feature either party: Israel has pledged to destroy Hamas, and Netanyahu may face accountability for failing to prevent the October 7 attacks that triggered the conflict. Additionally, new elections in Israel could potentially unseat the longtime prime minister. \u201cMost Israelis support early elections, the largest proportion of which want elections as soon as the war is over,\u201d said Yohanan Plesner, president of the Israel Democracy Institute. \u201cSo, in this sense, an extended war might delay elections and therefore postpone Netanyahu\u2019s day of reckoning with the voters.\u201d A majority of Jewish Israelis would be willing to bear the burden of continued fighting for at least six months, Plesner told CNN, citing data from\u00a0a survey conducted between March 31 and April 3. \u201cSo, Israelis are ready for sustained fighting \u2013\u202fthe question is who they want leading them.\u201d A significant majority of Israelis believe that the time has come for those responsible for the failures of October 7 and the war to step down, he added. The Israeli leader has so far refused to take responsibility for the war, stating that such questions will be addressed only after the military achieves its goals: the release of hostages and the elimination of Hamas. Israel has lost 292 soldiers in Gaza since it began its ground offensive there, which came in retaliation to Hamas\u2019 October 7 attack that killed 1,200 people and kidnapped more than 250 others, according to Israeli officials. \u00a0More than 36,000 people have been killed in Gaza since, according to the health ministry in the territory. Netanyahu also faces intense pressure from hardline members of his fragile coalition to continue the war. Some have threatened to quit the government if he accepts a ceasefire deal before Hamas is eliminated. Israeli diplomacy Israel\u2019s diplomatic isolation could grow if the war drags on. The government has become the target of increased censure on the world stage, drawing sharp criticism from some of its closest allies in Europe for its conduct. It has withdrawn envoys from three European nations, in response to them formally recognizing a Palestinian state, and had several South American and other countries downgrade diplomatic relations. Legal action could also escalate. Netanyahu is facing a potential arrest warrant by the International Criminal Court over some of Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza, and Israel is facing a genocide case at the International Court of Justice. That court has ordered Israel to halt its military operation in Rafah, a legally binding order that Israel has so far ignored. An extended war may also further delay prospects of normalization with Saudi Arabia, something Netanyahu singled out as a priority for his government before the October 7 attack. This conflict has derailed those efforts and the Jewish state has come under harsh criticism from Riyadh, as well as other Arab states that already have diplomatic ties with Israel, including Egypt and the United Arab Emirates. Egypt, the first Arab nation to recognize Israel, has warned its neighbor against stationing troops so close to its border. At least one member of Egyptian security personnel was killed during a shooting incident on the Egypt-Gaza border this week. \u201cIt is a deep conundrum,\u201d Orion of INSS said. For Israel, it is difficult to balance between the need to make sure Hamas will never again be able to launch another attack, with the duty to release the remaining hostages and other costs Israel is paying, he said. \u201cAnd currently Hamas doesn\u2019t seem to be ready to release them.\u201d Impact on Israel\u2019s economy The war hit Israel\u2019s economy hard in the immediate aftermath of October 7. In the fourth quarter of 2023, economic output plunged 21.7% compared to the year earlier, falling for the first time in nearly two years before rebounding in the next quarter. Despite the recovery, credit rating agency S&P Global said it expects the Israeli economy to recover slower than in previous downturns. In April, the agency downgraded Israel\u2019s credit rating, a measurement of the government\u2019s ability to repay its debts, and warned about further downgrades in the future. It expected the government\u2019s budget deficit to widen, \u201cmostly as a result of increased defense spending.\u201d Moody\u2019s Investors Service, another rating agency, also downgraded Israel, warning that the war will become a significant economic and political burden for the country over the long haul. It expects Israel\u2019s defense spending to be nearly double the level of 2022 by the end of 2024, and potentially rise even higher in coming years. Troops, ammunition, funding and the supply of arms are ultimately not endless, especially for a small country, Orion said. While the war in Gaza has been fought at varying intensity since October 7, it is nonetheless \u201cexacting a very high cost on Israel.\u201d Since its founding in 1948, Israel has fought numerous wars, but this one is its costliest. As of January, the Israeli military was spending $272 million per day on the war, according to the Israeli news site Ynet. By that time, the total cost had reached an estimated $60 billion, factoring in military expenses, damage to civilian infrastructure and compensation to Israeli businesses. This figure has likely increased significantly since then. Israel\u2019s decision-makers have taken notice. When the military initiated a partial withdrawal from Gaza in January, IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari cited economic concerns as one of the reasons, stating that it would \u201csignificantly ease the burden.\u201d Plesner said the government hasn\u2019t taken the necessary steps to mitigate economic damage. While Israel\u2019s economy has bounced back from previous conflicts and crises, he said, a prolonged war may make a recovery more challenging. \u201cThere are not sufficient funds available to cover the costs associated with the war on both the military and civilian related costs,\u201d he said. \u201cThe longer the war goes on, the deeper its economic impact.\u201d Biden\u2019s prospects for re-election The war is having deep consequences for US domestic politics and is weighing heavily on Biden\u2019s re-election bid. The president has been facing a severe backlash at home from progressive, young and Arab American voters that could put his re-election hopes in several key swing states in jeopardy. Biden has consistently supported Israel, offering it almost unconditional diplomatic and legal protection on the global stage. However, his administration has also taken unprecedented punitive measures against the Jewish state, including sanctions on West Bank settlers and withholding American arms that could be used against civilians in Rafah. Despite these efforts, the war persists, civilian casualties rise and famine spreads in Gaza, intensifying pressure from some of his electorate. A CNN poll last month found that Biden\u2019s handling of the war yields 28% approval to 71% disapproval, including an 81% disapproval mark among those younger than 35 and majority disapproval among Democrats (53%). In a speech at the White House on Friday, Biden laid out a three-phase proposal\u00a0Israel has submitted\u00a0to wind down the grinding crisis as he\u00a0declared, \u201cIt\u2019s time\u00a0for this war to end.\u201d It was perhaps the furthest Biden has gone in telling Israel its stated goals for its operation in Gaza\u00a0have\u00a0been met, and that the time has\u00a0arrived to stop the fighting as part of a hostage deal.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/01/middleeast/what-seven-months-of-war-mean-for-israel-hamas-mime-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_28_middleeast_gaza-us-munitions-rafah-strike-analysis-intl-hnk", "text": "Munitions made in the United States were used in the deadly Israeli strike\u00a0on\u00a0a displacement camp in Rafah on Sunday, a CNN analysis of video from the scene and a review by explosive weapons experts has found. At least 45 people were killed and more than 200 others injured after a fire broke out following the Israeli military\u2019s strike\u00a0on the outskirts of Gaza\u2019s southernmost city, most of them women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry and Palestinian medics. Footage obtained by CNN showed swathes of the camp in Rafah in flames, with scores of men, women and children frantically trying to find cover from the nighttime assault. Burned bodies, including those of children, could be seen being pulled by rescuers from the wreckage. Israel\u2019s escalating assault in Rafah \u2013 where some 1.3 million Palestinians were taking shelter before Israel began its operation there \u2013 has drawn swift international condemnation, with United Nations agencies, aid groups and multiple governments calling on Israel to immediately halt its offensive. Israeli tanks were seen advancing further into Rafah on Tuesday for the first time in Israel\u2019s seven-month war against Hamas, signaling a new phase Israel pressing on with its controversial and destructive offensive. However, US President Joe Biden is not altering his policy towards Israel, suggesting the deadly Rafah strike had not yet crossed a red line that would force changes in American support,  despite him saying in a CNN interview earlier this month\u00a0he wouldn\u2019t allow certain US weapons to be\u00a0used in a major offensive in Rafah. CNN geolocated videos showing tents in flames in the aftermath of the strike\u00a0on\u00a0the camp for internally displaced people known as \u201cKuwait Peace Camp 1.\u201d In video shared on social media, which CNN geolocated to the same scene by matching details including the camp\u2019s entrance sign and the tiles on the ground, the tail of a US-made GBU-39 small diameter bomb (SDB) is visible, according to four explosive weapons experts who reviewed the video for CNN. The GBU-39, which is manufactured by Boeing, is a high-precision munition\u00a0\u201cdesigned to attack strategically important point targets,\u201d and result in low collateral damage,\u00a0explosive weapons expert Chris Cobb-Smith told CNN Tuesday. However, \u201cusing any munition, even of this size, will always incur risks in a densely populated area,\u201d\u00a0said Cobb-Smith, who is also a\u00a0former British Army artillery officer. Trevor Ball, a former US Army senior explosive ordnance disposal team member who also identified the fragment as being from a GBU-39,\u00a0explained to\u00a0CNN how he drew his conclusion. \u201cThe warhead portion [of the munition] is distinct, and the guidance and wing section is extremely unique compared to other munitions. Guidance and wing sections of munitions are often the remnants left over even after a munition detonates.\u00a0I saw the tail actuation section and instantly knew it was one of the SDB/GBU-39 variants.\u201d Ball also concluded that while there is a variant of the GBU-39 known as the Focused Lethality Munition (FLM) which has a larger explosive payload but is designed to cause even less collateral damage, this was not the variant used in this case. \u201cThe FLM has a carbon fiber composite warhead body and is filled with tungsten ground into a powder. Photos of FLM testing have shown objects in the test coated in tungsten dust, which is not present [in video from the scene],\u201d he told CNN. Serial numbers on the remnants of the munitions also matched those for a manufacturer of GBU-39 parts based in California \u2013 pointing to more evidence the bombs were made in the US. Two\u00a0additional\u00a0explosive weapons experts \u2013\u00a0Richard Weir, senior crisis and conflict researcher at Human Rights Watch, and Chris Lincoln-Jones, a former British Army artillery officer and weapons and targeting expert \u2013 identified the fragment as being part of a US-manufactured GBU-39 when reviewing the video for CNN, though they were unable to comment on the variant used. Asked for comment on the munitions used in the Rafah strike at Tuesday\u2019s briefing, Pentagon deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh told reporters: \u201cI do not know what type of munition was used in that airstrike. I\u2019d have to refer you to the Israelis to speak to that.\u201d CNN has also reached out to the US National Security Council. Main weapons supplier The US has long been the biggest supplier of arms to Israel, according to data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), and that support has continued despite the growing political pressure on the Biden administration over the Gaza offensive. Last month, Biden signed a foreign aid bill that included\u00a0$26 billion for the Israel-Hamas conflict\u00a0\u2014\u00a0including $15 billion in Israeli military aid, $9 billion in humanitarian aid for Gaza and $2.4 billion for regional US military operations. CNN\u2019s identification of the munition is consistent with a claim made by IDF spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari in a briefing about the tragedy on Tuesday. Hagari told reporters the strike \u2013 which he said\u00a0targeted senior Hamas commanders \u2013 used two munitions with small warheads containing 17 kilos of explosives, adding these bombs were \u201cthe smallest munitions that our jets could use.\u201d The traditional GBU-39 warhead has an explosive payload of 17 kilos. Hagari said the deadly fire which occurred following the strike was not caused solely by weapons used by the Israeli military. \u201cOur munitions alone could not have ignited a fire of this size,\u201d Hagari said, adding the IDF was investigating \u201cwhat may have caused such a large fire to ignite.\u201d He added that Israel is looking into whether the strike was \u201cunintentionally set off possible stored weapons in a nearby compound.\u201d Israel\u2019s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the deadly airstrike in Rafah was a \u201ctragic error,\u201d but said Israel has vowed to press on with its operation despite international outrage and a US warning not to proceed.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/middleeast/gaza-us-munitions-rafah-strike-analysis-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "world"}}

The official opposition party, the Democratic Alliance (DA), had 24.7% of the vote, while the far-left Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) \u2013 a splinter party of the ANC \u2013 had 8.9%, data from the country\u2019s electoral commission showed. The respected research group CSIR modeled the ANC winning less than 45% of the national poll as of mid-morning on Thursday.

In past elections, results from rural areas \u2013 where the ANC has major strongholds \u2013 have come in later, boosting results for the party. Once all the votes are counted, if the ANC remains below 50% it will be forced to enter a coalition with one or more parties. Depending on how low its support dips, it may need to form a deal with one of the larger opposition parties such as the DA or EFF to remain in power.

{"id": "2024_05_30_europe_iceland-volcano-eruption-grindavik-intl-hnk", "text": "A volcano in southwestern Iceland erupted Wednesday for the fifth time since December, spewing massive lava flows that threatened to cut off the town of Grindav\u00edk and prompting the evacuation of the world-famous Blue Lagoon. The eruption began around 1 p.m. local time (9 a.m. ET) Wednesday following an earthquake at the Sundhn\u00faks crater, Iceland\u2019s public broadcaster RUV reported. Iceland\u2019s Meteorological Office had earlier warned that a volcanic eruption was likely following \u201cintense seismic activity\u201d at the crater and a build-up of magma in its underground reservoir. Dramatic video and images from the scene showed fountains of red-hot lava shooting into the air along a 3.4-kilometer (two-mile) fissure near Mount Hagafell on the Reykjanes Peninsula. Lava flows initially cut off two out of three roads leading to the fishing town of Grindav\u00edk and were steadily moving along a defensive barrier built to save the town and key infrastructure from being destroyed, Iceland\u2019s Meteorological Office said. But the situation had improved by Thursday, the mayor of Grindav\u00edk said. The town remains without electricity, but both hot and cold water are running in the town with no apparent damage to the piping system, RUV reported. \u201cI like the situation quite well compared to how it looked at the beginning of the eruption yesterday,\u201d Mayor Fannar J\u00f3nasson said. Initial monitoring by the Met Office warned the start of the eruption was \u201cmore vigorous\u201d than previous times, but the lava activity had \u201csignificantly decreased overnight,\u201d it said. Just hours before, V\u00ed\u00f0ir Reynisson, from Iceland\u2019s Civil Defense, had told RUV that \u201clava is flowing outside the defense walls at Grindav\u00edk in several places, and lava is also starting to flow outside the walls at Svartsengi.\u201d He warned that Grindav\u00edk was at risk of becoming completely cut off, though he added that the defense barriers were holding. \u201cThe houses in the west and farthest part of the town would have gone under the lava if it weren\u2019t for the defensive walls, but they are still standing and defending,\u201d Reynisson reportedly said. Grindav\u00edk, a town of about 3,000 people,\u00a0was mostly evacuated before a previous eruption in December. Residents and responders who remain in the town have been urged to leave while they still can, though police told RUV that three residents are refusing to evacuate. Electricity to Grindav\u00edk was cut on Wednesday as a protective measure as lava flows closed in on high-voltage lines and hot and cold pipes in the ground, Kristinn Har\u00f0arsonar, production manager at energy company HS Orka, told RUV. \u201cMost of the high-voltage lines are gone, the pylons are badly damaged and some are on fire,\u201d the Civil Defense\u2019s Reynisson later said. Benedikt \u00d3feigsson, from the Met Office, told RUV that the beginning of this eruption was more powerful than previously due to more accumulated magma in the chamber. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot more lava flow than we\u2019ve seen before,\u201d he reportedly said. \u201cThis is reflected in today\u2019s massive lava flows.\u201d Iceland\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a post on X that there was no disruption to international or domestic flights. But for the third time in just over two months, the country\u2019s famous geothermal spa and tourist hotspot the Blue Lagoon was evacuated, according to its operations manager. Just under an hour\u2019s drive from Iceland\u2019s capital and largest city Reykjavik, the Blue Lagoon is one of the country\u2019s most popular tourist attractions. The site is part of southwest Iceland\u2019s Reykjanes Peninsula \u2014 a thick finger of land pointing west into the North Atlantic Ocean from Reykjavik. Iceland is one of the most active volcanic areas on the planet. Rather than having a central volcano, the Reykjanes Peninsula is dominated by a rift valley, with lava fields and cones. The environment agency\u2019s air quality meters are \u201cgreen\u201d across\u00a0Iceland, indicating there is currently no air pollution from the eruption, the monitoring website\u00a0shows. However,\u00a0Iceland\u2019s national police warned a westerly wind could carry gas pollution from the eruption eastward on Thursday into Friday, which might affect areas in South\u00a0Iceland. \u201cAccording to the\u00a0Icelandic Met Office, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the amount of gas emissions from the eruption site,\u201d the police said in a\u00a0statement. While the gas pollution forecasted in Reykjav\u00edk on Wednesday never materialized, police encouraged residents to monitor real-time air pollution levels online.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/europe/iceland-volcano-eruption-grindavik-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "travel_chef-mauro-colagreco-xi-jinping-state-dinner-france-intl-hnk", "text": "During the 11 years Chinese leader Xi Jinping has been in power, he\u2019s unintentionally kicked off numerous food and travel trends, from boosting the sale of bao in Beijing to accelerating the sale of an English pub. But when it comes to the official state dinners he attends, rarely does the public have a chance to experience those same dishes themselves. Until now. Back in early May, Xi headed out on a whirlwind trip through Europe, his first since 2019. While in Paris, French President Emmanuel Macron hosted a formal state banquet at the Elysee Palace in the Chinese leader\u2019s honor, marking the 60th anniversary of China-France diplomatic ties. But curious diners hoping for a chance to sample what the two world leaders were served won\u2019t find the dishes in Paris. For that, they\u2019ll have to head to Hong Kong restaurant Plaisance, which has launched a special China-France State Dinner Experience menu that\u2019s available till late June. The restaurant is an outpost of Mauro Colagreco, chef-owner of famed eatery Mirazur in Menton, France, and one of just three chefs called in to create the state dinner menu. The chance to cook for a mystery guest Colegreco says the opportunity to cook for the famous world leaders started with a phone call from the Elysee Palace. \u201c[They were] asking me to take part in the menu for this state banquet, without knowing who the guest president would be, for reasons of state secrecy,\u201d Colegreco tells CNN in an email, adding that he quickly said yes to the assignment. \u201cThis adds to the excitement, as you never know what the guests\u2019 tastes will be. But in the end, we created a menu that is very true to the cuisine I love, with exceptional products and delicate flavors.\u201d Colegreco was tasked with designing the starter of the night. With his Italian-Argentine background and experience in France, the chef is known for fusing influences from all of those cultures, with a strong focus on seasonality and sustainability. In 2019, he became the first non-French chef to earn three Michelin stars in France with Mirazur. It was crowned the No.1 restaurant at the World\u2019s 50 Best Restaurants awards that same year. Colagreco says their team only had a month to design and prepare their dish for the state dinner \u2013 but the chefs were given \u201ccarte blanche\u201d\u00a0to create whatever they liked as long as it \u201cwas representative and respectful of French products.\u201d \u201cI must admit, I was quite confident when I found out who the guest was; I have a deep love for Asia and my very first experience there was in Shanghai in 2011,\u201d says Colagreco. In addition to the Plaisance restaurant in Hong Kong, his restaurant group now has five establishments in mainland China. Colagreco says it was a challenging and thrilling experience to create a menu for the two world leaders. After developing the recipes, the chefs sent their various requirements and lists of ingredients to the Elysee Palace kitchen team, led by chef Fabrice Desvignes. Then, on the morning of the state dinner, the Mirazur team arrived to start preparing for the evening alongside the other chefs. Within this short period, Colagreco says they had to be flexible and make their way around the unfamiliar kitchen quickly and smoothly. \u201cThen we had a visit from Mrs. Brigitte Macron in the kitchens, which really reassured and motivated us,\u201d he says of meeting France\u2019s First Lady. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a responsibility to cook for her. It\u2019s only now that we realize how lucky we were to be part of this wonderful moment.\u201d The starter that wowed China\u2019s First Lady A total of 250 guests were invited to the state dinner. The final menu was relatively short \u2013 a three-course meal to suit the leaders\u2019 tight schedules. Colagreco\u2019s starter was a Tourteau crab (homegrown crab from France) and Oscietra caviar cake blanketed by a beautiful pink and purple flower-infused jelly casting. \u201cThe whole team took the time to come up with a surprising dish,\u201d says Colagreco. \u201cWe had to offer flavors that would appeal to everyone\u2019s taste buds, but also present our culinary identity. The aim was to showcase our expertise in healthy eating and respect for the product. \u201cBut it was also an artistic and colorful presentation, with the veil of our cosmos flowers that we brought from our unique Mirazur gardens. Aesthetics are very important because it\u2019s the first approach to a dish and this one is particularly refined.\u201d And thankfully for the chef, that attention to detail didn\u2019t go unnoticed. \u201cThe Chinese president\u2019s wife seemed to find it very attractive, so mission accomplished,\u201d he says. Colagreco was able to talk to the guests at the end of the dinner. That was when he says Peng Liyuan, Xi\u2019s wife, thanked him and complimented the aesthetics, finesse and flavors of the starter. Pierre Gagnaire, chef of the eponymous three-Michelin-star restaurant in Paris, was in charge of the evening\u2019s main course. He opted to serve slow-cooked Bresse chicken and morels in a blend of Cognac, Port and Madeira wine and chicken stock. The dish was topped with a sauce made with Vin Jaune, a special white wine made in France\u2019s wine-making Jura region. The dessert, strawberries and verbena pavlova, created by D\u00e9licatisserie founder and superstar pastry chef Nina M\u00e9tayer, wrapped up the evening. Fromagerie\u00a0Quatrehomme, a cheesemonger and refiner in Paris since 1953, curated the cheeses for the event. All the serveware used during the dinner was provided by La Manufacture de S\u00e8vres, which was founded in 1759 and is one of France\u2019s principal royal/national porcelain factories. \u2018Food is what binds the world together\u2019 At Colagreco\u2019s Plaisance restaurant in Hong Kong, diners will get to sample all three of the dishes Xi and Macron were served during the recent state dinner. The chef says the dishes and ingredients remain true to the original versions \u2013 only the presentations will be adjusted as the tableware will be different. For those who have a bit more time than Xi and Macron, the restaurant also offers a longer menu with three additional dishes from the Mirazur and Plaisance restaurants. The cost of the three-course option starts from 1,888 Hong Kong dollars ($241), while the six-course menu is 2,888 Hong Kong dollars ($369). Having moved to France in 2001, then opening Mirazur in 2006, Colagreco says the state dinner was a special moment for him. \u201cI am truly proud and honored to have been chosen for this exceptional dinner and to represent France, my host country for almost 23 years, through my cuisine,\u201d says the chef, who is now 47 years old. \u201cI truly believe that food is what binds the world together. Cooking is an act of love. As chefs, it\u2019s our duty to pass on these values of sharing and to contribute to a positive atmosphere for this kind of diplomatic dinner.\u00a0We are ambassadors, using our cuisine to showcase French know-how and to introduce people to our culture through flavors and combinations of tastes.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/chef-mauro-colagreco-xi-jinping-state-dinner-france-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_30_asia_japan-whaling-mothership-kangei-maru-intl-hnk", "text": "Wearing a toy whale hat, whale tie and a whale motif shirt, Hideki Tokoro spends much of his days thinking about the world\u2019s largest mammals. But he doesn\u2019t want to protect them. He wants to hunt them. To do that his company Kyodo Senpaku has built and launched a brand-new whaling $48 million \u201cmothership\u201d \u2013 the Kangei Maru. \u201cWe are proud of catching whales and are very proud of this ship which will allow us to begin offshore mothership-style whaling this year,\u201d Tokoro told reporters as he escorted them around the 370-foot, 9,300-ton vessel that set sail last Saturday for an eight-month tour of the country\u2019s northern waters. The new ship replaces the Nisshin Maru, the infamous whaling factory vessel dubbed by activists as a \u201cfloating slaughterhouse\u201d that was decommissioned in 2020 after more than 30 years of service, during which it frequently clashed with anti-whaling activists. The Kangei Maru is bigger and faster than its predecessor, the company says, and is equipped with state-of-the-art drones able to travel a reported 100 kilometers (62 miles) to allow crews of smaller boats to quickly locate and kill whales. But activists say the ship\u2019s high-powered features, including a cruising range of 13,000 kilometers (more than 8,000 miles) and its ability to sail for up to 60 days, suggests that Japan is setting its sights on whales far beyond its northern waters. \u201cJapan has never given up on its whaling ambitions,\u201d veteran anti-whaling activist Paul Watson told CNN. \u201cThe only purpose of a vessel like that is so it can travel long distances to the Southern Ocean to hunt whales, (and) what the whalers are doing right now is really just a test run. They are testing out the new ship in their waters.\u201d \u2018We need to cull whales\u2019 The Kangei Maru boasts a slipway large enough to haul 85-foot whales from the sea that leads to an indoor flensing deck the size\u00a0of two basketball courts. There, workers will strip away the blubber before cutting up the whale flesh on enormous cutting boards, before vacuum-packing and storing the meat in 40 industrial freezers, ready for sale. \u201cWhales are at the top of the food chain. They compete with humans by eating marine creatures that should be feeding other fish,\u201d Tokoro said on the tour. \u201cWe need to cull whales to keep the balance of the ecosystem \u2013 it\u2019s our job and mission to protect oceans for the future.\u201d He also told CNN that most of the ship\u2019s catch would be killed \u201calmost instantly\u201d by cannons at sea. \u201cWe aim for perfection, but some of them may suffer. In such cases, we will use a rifle to finish the job.\u201d Besides objecting to the slaughter one of the ocean\u2019s most majestic creatures, marine conservation groups and scientists have highlighted the important role which whales play in helping to tackle the climate crisis through sequestering and storing planet-heating carbon emissions. \u201cWhales are not just consumers in ocean eco-systems \u2013 they recycle a ton of nutrients into the environment which helps stimulate plant-life growth,\u201d\u00a0said marine ecologist Ari Friedlaender, also rejecting pro-whaling arguments that commercial hunts could be \u201csustainable.\u201d \u201cHumans have a very long history of killing whales and have not done a good job of being able to sustainably harvest animals,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no way to sustainably harvest a wild animal like that.\u201d Why is Japan so determined to keep whaling? Commercial whaling was banned in 1986 under a moratorium by the International Whaling Commission (IWC) after whale populations were almost driven to extinction by humans. Japan is one of three countries \u2013 along with Norway and Iceland \u2013 that continues to hunt whales, and officials argue that the industry is an important part of its culture and history \u2013 and also provides food security. Iceland, which has fiercely defended commercial whaling, said it would end whaling in 2024, citing falling demand for whale meat as well as \u201chigh operation costs and little proof of any economic advantage.\u201d Commercial whaling continues in Norway, which experts say has quietly become the world\u2019s leading whaling nation \u2013 killing more whales than Japan and Iceland combined. For decades, Japan has justified whaling under the guise of \u201cscientific research.\u201d In 2018, it tried one last time to persuade the IWC to allow it to resume commercial whaling \u2013 and failed. So, it withdrew from the body and resumed commercial whaling months later, in defiance of international criticism. \u201cJapan is no longer party to the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling and can argue that it is no longer bound by provisions and constraints,\u201d Donald Rothwell, an international law professor at the Australian National University (ANU), told CNN. \u201cWithin its waters, it\u00a0has the absolute authority to control the management of living resources \u2013 and that includes whales.\u201d Under Japanese law, three species of whale are permitted to be hunted in its territorial waters and exclusive economic zones \u2013 endangered sei whales and threatened minke whales and Bryde\u2019s whales, with endangered fin whales set to be added to kill lists. \u201cWhales are important food resources and should be sustainably utilized based on scientific evidence,\u201d said government spokesperson Yoshimasa Hayashi this month, as he announced a proposal to hunt fin whales, the second-largest species of whales after blue whales. The World Cetacean Alliance (WCA) marine conservation group said that whale watching in Japan was \u201ca far more successful industry\u201d than harvesting whale meat. \u201cCommercial whaling in the 21st century is unjustifiable,\u201d it said. \u00a0\u201cThe whaling industry in Japan recognizes that it is a challenge to increase whale meat consumption and there is currently no market,\u201d WCA said. \u201cSo why keep slaughtering these wonderful and intelligent animals?\u201d Tokoro ruled out whale watching. \u201cWe will not switch to whale watching but eating whale meat while watching whales might be quite a nice touch,\u201d he told CNN. Demand for whale meat in Japan Over the years, Kyodo Senpaku has launched aggressive public relation campaigns to promote whale meat and win over new generations of young diners. Tokoro says he eats whale meat every day. \u201cWhale meat is not only delicious, it\u2019s good for you,\u201d Tokoro told reporters during the tour of his ship, as he talked\u00a0up the purported \u201chealth benefits\u201d of eating whale, claiming that the meat could cure hair loss and cancer. \u201cI can definitely say whale meat and rice is a really good (combination) for Japanese people. There is no doubt about that, much better than beef and bun.\u201d Last year Tokoro, again wearing his whale hat, launched controversial whale meat vending machines, offering whale sashimi, whale steak and whale bacon. The company has also sponsored influencers from countries such as Russia, Thailand and South Korea \u2013 hosting them at a local izakaya in Osaka, where they sampled dishes like whale sashimi and skewers and encouraging them to take the message back to their followers that whale meat was delicious and acceptable. Japan may have a long and storied history of whaling dating back to the Edo period in the 1600s, but experts say whale meat consumption only really peaked after World War II \u2013 when food sources, especially protein, were scarce. Today, whale meat is now\u00a0considered more of a \u201cluxury\u201d dish, said Nobuhiro Kishigami, a professor at the National Museum of Ethnology, one of the country\u2019s largest research institutes. \u201cThe fact is that there is little interest in whaling and whale meat among Japanese people as a whole,\u201d Kishigami told CNN. \u201cMost young people, especially the majority that live in cities, do not know or care much about whaling and its history and remain indifferent.\u201d The same goes for dolphin meat, he added. \u201cIt\u2019s just a sign of the times. But if we were asked to stop eating blue fin tuna, there would be a huge uproar. We would react very badly to that.\u201d Japan\u2019s fisheries ministry estimates that between 1,000 and 2,000 tons of whale meat are consumed annually in the country, compared to average annual totals of more than 230,000 tons during the 1960s. \u201cThere is still certainly a market (for whale meat in Japan) but market size and production volume have shrunk dramatically,\u201d economics professor Mitsuhiro Kishimoto from the Shimonoseki City University told CNN, noting that several major whaling companies had since withdrawn from the trade. \u201cThe demand for whale blubber disappeared after the discovery of oil and petroleum products, so many countries stopped whaling and with international regulations, the number of caught whales decreased and as a result, whale meat production decreased while beef, pork and chicken became more popular,\u201d he said. Scientists have also expressed\u00a0concern about the risks of consuming whale meat, with studies pointing to high levels of mercury found in whale and dolphin meat, which could prove dangerous to consumers \u2013 especially pregnant women and young children. Could Japanese whalers return to the Southern Ocean? Located in deep waters surrounding the entire continent of Antarctica, the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary hosts dozens of whale species including humpbacks, blue whales and fin whales. It was established by the IWC in 1994 to protect whale species after centuries of hunting, but until 2019 Japan took regular trips to the region to hunt for self-stated \u201cscientific research\u201d purposes. Japanese whalers killed 333 minke whales in the Southern Ocean in 2018/2019, according to the IWC, before abandoning the region after it left the international body. Takaaki Sakamoto, director of the Whaling Affairs Office in Japan\u2019s Fisheries Agency, told CNN that Japan sent ships to the Antarctic last year to collect numbers and skin surface samples, but those expeditions did not involve killing whales. He said they planned to return this year to do the same. Tokoro told CNN that the Kangei Maru is not planning on killing whales beyond Japanese waters because it doesn\u2019t make economic sense. \u201cCommercial whaling is not profitable,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will take 50 days to get to the Antarctic and back and we are not confident we can make a profit by paying the wages of employees and fuel for 50 days. However, I will go only when the government orders me to go \u2026 Until then, I will not go commercial whaling at all.\u201d But\u00a0activists aren\u2019t convinced. \u201cGiven the ship\u2019s long-range capabilities and drones, and recent announcements from Japan\u2019s fisheries ministry that it is keen to start hunting fin whales, we believe there is a high likelihood that Japanese whalers will return to the Southern Ocean,\u201d said James Anderson, activist and founder of the Whale Defense Agency (WDA). \u201cThe Southern Ocean is a critical habitat for many whale species that provides a safe haven for breeding and feeding \u2026 protecting it is more important than ever due to the increasing threats posed by climate change and illegal whaling.\u201d Rothwell, from ANU, said that if Japan looks to kill whales beyond its territorial waters, it can expect an international response. \u201cIt would immediately trigger global interest and action about the conservation and protection of whales, especially in waters sanctioned by the IWC as a whale sanctuary,\u201d Rothwell said. Watson, the veteran anti-whaling activist, told CNN he\u2019s prepared to mount a physical response \u2013 with a former Japanese fisheries patrol vessel he\u2019s acquired in anticipation of Japanese whalers returning to the Antarctic by the end of the year. \u201cIt\u2019s called the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary for a reason \u2013 you don\u2019t kill whales there,\u201d Watson said. \u201cWe want to be able to track them down and intercept them like we\u2019ve done before \u2013 and we are more than prepared to do it again.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/asia/japan-whaling-mothership-kangei-maru-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_29_asia_north-korea-trash-balloons-intl-hnk", "text": "North Korea has adopted a new strategy to contend with its southern neighbor: sending floating bags of trash containing \u201cfilth\u201d across the border, carried by massive balloons. The South Korean military began noticing \u201clarge amounts of balloons\u201d arriving from the North starting Tuesday night, detecting more than 150 as of Wednesday morning, according to the country\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS). Photos released by the JCS show plastic bags carried by two giant balloons, with some broken packages spilling scraps of plastic, sheets of paper, and what appears to be dirt onto roads and sidewalks. The balloons so far contain \u201cfilth and garbage\u201d and are being analyzed by government agencies, said the JCS, adding that the military was cooperating with the United Nations Command. \u201cNorth Korea\u2019s actions clearly violate international law and seriously threaten the safety of our citizens,\u201d it added. \u201cAll responsibility arising from the North Korean balloons lies entirely with North Korea, and we sternly warn North Korea to immediately stop its inhumane and low-level actions.\u201d Local governments also sent messages to residents in the northern Gyeonggi and Gangwon provinces to warn of the \u201cunidentified objects,\u201d and advised against outdoor activities. The packages risk damaging residential areas, airports and highways, said the JCS. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un\u2019s younger sister Kim Yo Jong \u2013 who is also a senior official in the reclusive regime \u2013 referred to the activities as \u201cfreedom of expression.\u201d In a statement published by state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) on Wednesday, Kim said that North Korea had dispersed toilet paper and other waste materials in bags attached to the\u00a0balloons along the Korean border and central areas. Kim compared North Korea\u2019s actions to South Korea\u2019s years-long practice of sending\u00a0balloons with anti-North Korea leaflets towards her nation. \u201cWe\u2019ve done some of the things they always do, but I don\u2019t know why they\u2019re making a big deal like they\u2019ve been hit by a shower of fire,\u201d Kim said. The move, according to North Korean state media KCNA, was to retaliate against South Korean activists who often send materials to the North \u2013 including propaganda leaflets, food, medicine, radios and USB sticks containing South Korean news and television dramas, all prohibited in the isolated totalitarian dictatorship. Campaigners in the South, including defectors from North Korea, have long sent these materials through balloons, drones, and bottles floating down the cross-border river \u2013 even after South Korea\u2019s parliament banned such actions in 2020. \u201cScattering leaflets by use of balloons is a dangerous provocation that can be utilized for a specific military purpose,\u201d said Kim Kang Il, North Korea\u2019s Vice Minister of National Defense, KCNA reported on Sunday. He accused South Korea of using \u201cpsychological warfare\u201d by scattering \u201cvarious dirty things\u201d near border areas, declaring that the North would take \u201ctit for tat action.\u201d \u201cMounds of wastepaper and filth will soon be scattered over the border areas and the interior of (South Korea) and it will directly experience how much effort is required to remove them,\u201d Kim said, according to KCNA. \u201cWhen our national sovereignty, security and interests are violated, we will take action immediately.\u201d Kim also decried joint US-South Korea military drills, which have increased in recent years as tensions have risen in the Korean peninsula. The 2020 law that prohibited sending leaflets also\u00a0restricted\u00a0loudspeaker propaganda broadcasts, which the South\u2019s military once championed as part of psychological warfare against the North until it withdrew the equipment following a 2018 summit between the two Koreas. But even after parliament passed the ban, activists told Reuters they planned to continue \u2013 including the defector Park Sang-hak, who had been sending materials back to his homeland for 15 years, vowing to continue in an effort to give North Koreans a rare glimpse of the outside world. Earlier this month, Park\u2019s organization Fighters for a Free North Korea said in a statement it had sent 20 balloons toward North Korea, containing 300,000 leaflets that condemned Kim Jong Un and 2,000 USB sticks containing K-pop and music videos. \u201cIn order to appeal and urge the North Korean people to rise up and put an end to Kim Jong Un \u2026 the group is sending the leaflets to the compatriots in North Korea,\u201d the organization said in a statement. For decades, North Korea has been almost completely closed off from the rest of the world, with tight control over what information gets in or out. Foreign materials including movies and books are banned, with only a few state-sanctioned exceptions; those caught with foreign contraband often face severe punishment, defectors say. Earlier this year a South Korean research group has released rare footage that it claimed showed North Korean teenagers sentenced to hard labor for watching and distributing K-dramas. Restrictions softened somewhat in recent decades as North Korea\u2019s relationship with China expanded. Tentative steps to open up allowed some South Korean elements, including parts of its pop culture, to seep into the hermit nation \u2013 especially in 2017 and 2018, when relations thawed between the two countries. But the situation in North Korea deteriorated in the following years and diplomatic talks fell apart \u2013 prompting strict rules to snap back into place in the North.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/asia/north-korea-trash-balloons-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_31_europe_us-weapons-ukraine-strike-russia-kharkiv-intl", "text": "The story of the past 27 months since Russia invaded Ukraine has been one of crumbling taboos. After repelling Russia\u2019s initial march on Kyiv, Ukraine has asked its Western allies for greater and greater support: first ammunition, then tanks, then cluster munitions, then fighter jets. Each time, the West has agonized over whether to grant Kyiv\u2019s latest request, fearing escalation and a potential Russian response. Each time, the taboo was broken \u2013 and nothing happened. What seemed beyond the pale one week had become banal the next. But the rhythm of deliberation and delay has been hard to shake. Despite securing more weapons from the United States last month, Ukraine has not been able to use them as it pleases. As Moscow this month launched its surprise assault on the northeastern Kharkiv region, Washington forbade Kyiv from using US weapons to strike targets inside Russia. This too crumbled. President Joe Biden this week gave Ukraine permission to carry out limited strikes using US weapons in Russian territory around Kharkiv, after several European nations had removed restrictions on how the weapons they have given to Kyiv can be used. \u201cOver the past few weeks, Ukraine came to us and asked for the authorization to use weapons that were provided to defend against this aggression\u201d near Kharkiv city, \u201cincluding against Russian forces that are massing on the Russian side of the border,\u201d US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Friday on a visit to Prague, the Czech capital. He confirmed Biden had approved Ukraine\u2019s request. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky praised the decision as a \u201cstep forward\u201d which will help his forces to defend the embattled Kharkiv region. While the decision may mark a new phase of the war, analysts have questioned whether the new freedoms will significantly bolster Ukraine\u2019s ability to repel Russia\u2019s invasion. Some are bullish. This month, the calls for the US to remove the restrictions became more desperate, as Russia continue to pummel Kharkiv city with missiles and make gains elsewhere in the region. In a CNN op-ed, Adam Kinzinger and Ben Hodges described the bizarre effect of the US taboo: \u201cWe have heard Ukrainian soldiers repeatedly tell stories of Russian columns attacking, being repelled, and retreating to safe Russian territory to regroup, have a hot meal, plan and attack again.\u201d \u201cUkraine cannot win if Russians can attack civilian targets with impunity and call \u2018time out\u2019 in their own territory,\u201d they wrote, urging Biden to call his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin\u2019s bluff. But military analysts have tempered expectations, partly because the US is standing firm in not allowing Ukraine to use the most formidable munition it has been given to fire into Russia: the long-range missiles known as ATACMS that can hit targets 300 kilometers (nearly 200 miles) away. Instead, Ukraine can only use shorter-range missiles known as GMLRS, which have a range of around 70 kilometers (around 40 miles). Kateryna Stepanenko, an analyst at the Institute for the Study of War in Washington, told CNN the policy change will \u201cblunt\u201d Russia\u2019s offensive in Kharkiv, but still \u201cpreserves the majority of Russia\u2019s sanctuary space.\u201d \u201cThe policy still protects Russia\u2019s operational and deep rear sufficiently that this change near Kharkiv Oblast is insufficient to bring about a turning point in the war. Ukraine particularly needs the capacity to strike deep rear areas to defeat the Russian ground and air threats, as many Russian airfields that support strikes against Ukrainian cities are located outside of the allowed GMLRS range,\u201d she said. Franz-Stefan Gady, an associate fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, told CNN the GMLRS cross-border strikes will allow Ukraine \u201cto hit some Russian staging areas, command and control centers, as well as supply depots. It will not stop but complicate Russian military operations against Kharkhiv.\u201d \u201cWe need to be realistic about what can be expected from this policy change, since the Russian armed forces have already adapted to the introduction of ground-based precision fires,\u201d he said. Mathieu Boulegue, a researcher at the Center for European Policy Analysis, said the policy change would allow Ukraine to \u201cbe more efficient when it comes to repelling attacks and pushing back preemptively.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not a game changer, per se. It\u2019s an add-on, a steroid, an extra booster for Ukraine to defend itself,\u201d he said. Red lines fade The US is joining the United Kingdom, France, Germany and several others in removing restrictions on how Ukraine uses the weapons it is given. Before Biden gave the green light, Putin had made veiled nuclear threats to countries considering allowing Ukraine to strike Russia with their weapons. He warned the move could lead to \u201cserious consequences,\u201d particularly for \u201csmall and densely populated countries.\u201d As well as making nuclear threats, Putin also signaled earlier this month that he was open to peace talks. \u201cAll of these false narratives deliberately aimed to discourage Western decisionmakers from allowing Ukraine to preempt Russia\u2019s attack on Kharkiv city,\u201d Stepanenko said. While the removal of this taboo appears to mark a new chapter in the war, Russia has previously experienced Ukrainian strikes with Western weapons on territory it considers its own. Ukraine has frequently targeted occupied Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, using \u201cStorm Shadow\u201d missiles provided by the UK. Ukraine also launched strikes on Kharkiv and Kherson in late 2022, as it sought to liberate the regions occupied by Russia in the early weeks of the full-scale invasion. In both cases, Russia had warned Ukraine and its Western allies not to cross its red line. In both cases, Ukraine and its Western allies ignored the warning. \u201cThe Kremlin already regards strikes against occupied Crimea and Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhia oblasts as \u2018strikes against Russia,\u2019 but the reality is that there are few things that Russia can do to further escalate its war in Ukraine without incurring major risks,\u201d Stepanenko said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/europe/us-weapons-ukraine-strike-russia-kharkiv-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_30_style_stegosaurus-fossil-auction-scli-intl-scn", "text": "A Stegosaurus skeleton described as the \u201cmost complete and best preserved\u201d of its kind ever discovered is expected to fetch up to $6 million at auction this summer \u2013 but not everyone is happy about it\ufeff. The \u201cexceptional\u201d and \u201cvirtually complete\u201d dinosaur fossil, which is 11 feet tall and 20 feet long, will be sold as part of Sotheby\u2019s annual Geek Week. Paleontologists have questioned the sale of such specimens to private bidders, arguing that these finds should be preserved in museums or other public spaces. Nevertheless, that will not stop the auction of the 150-million-year-old fossil from going ahead in New York on July 17. Apex, as it has been nicknamed, is the \u201cfinest Stegosaurus specimen to come to market,\u201d Sotheby\u2019s said in a press release Wednesday. It is expected to fetch between $4 million and $6 million, making it one of the most valuable dinosaur fossils ever offered up for sale, the auction house added. Characterized by its distinctive shape, the Stegosaurus was a herbivorous dinosaur with a tiny head and bony plates marching down its back, ending in a spiked tail. A commercial paleontologist named Jason Cooper unearthed Apex on his private land in Colorado, and Sotheby\u2019s said it was involved in the process from the outset. The auction house collaborated closely with Cooper to \u201cdocument the entire process, from discovery and excavation to restoration, preparation, and mounting, ensuring that the documentation and sale of the specimen is handled with the highest standards and transparency.\u201d This collaboration, it said, \u201ccontinues Sotheby\u2019s legacy of pioneering Natural History auctions.\u201d Some, however, see it differently. Steve Brusatte, a professor\u00a0of paleontology and evolution at Scotland\u2019s University of Edinburgh, described the specimen as \u201can important dinosaur fossil,\u201d particularly as there are \u201cfar fewer good (Stegosaurus) skeletons than other famous dinosaurs like T. rex and Triceratops.\u201d This, according to Brusatte, is part of the reason it should not end up in private hands. \u201cIf what the auction house is saying is true, and what I\u2019m seeing in these photos is genuine, then this skeleton really does belong in a museum, where it can be conserved, studied by scientists, and put on display to inspire people from all walks of life,\u201d he said in an email to CNN Thursday. \u201cIt is a great shame when a fossil like this, which could educate and rouse the curiosity of so many people, just disappears into the mansion of an oligarch.\u201d \u201cApex\u201d was discovered in the Morrison Formation in Moffat County, Colorado - and very aptly close to the town of Dinosaur \u2013 in May 2022. It took more than a year to fully excavate the specimen, which was found to have evidence of arthritis, suggesting it lived to an advanced age, with no signs of combat or predation-related injuries. The highest bidder will receive a copy of the dinosaur\u2019s scan data, plus a full license to use any 3D data however they choose. This, according to Sotheby\u2019s, \u201cwill allow primary information about the dinosaur to remain with the specimen and promote collaboration in future research and education.\u201d Brusatte argued, however, that research and education would be best served if the fossil was owned by an institution with an expertise in dinosaurs. \u201cThe uber-wealthy will always be able to outbid museums when a dinosaur is sold on the open market, so my hope is that if there is somebody with the means to buy a fossil like this, and this fossil captures their fancy, that they donate it to a museum,\u201d said Brusatte. \u201cWhat a legacy that would be \u2014 to have your dinosaur on public display, to have your name up in lights as the donor who saved the dinosaur for science, as kids and families stroll by and gawk at this awesome creature from prehistory.\u201d London\u2019s Natural History Museum is home to \u201cSophie,\u201d a comparable fossil - though \u201cApex\u201d is at least 30% bigger, according to Sotheby\u2019s. Cassandra Hatton, Sotheby\u2019s global head of science and popular culture, described Apex as \u201csimply one of the best fossils of its kind ever unearthed.\u201d Visitors to Sotheby\u2019s New York galleries will be able to see Apex as part of a free exhibition of some of the items on sale during Geek Week. Sotheby\u2019s \u201clegacy of pioneering Natural History auctions,\u201d as it refers to it, includes the 2022 sale of an ancient skeleton of a Gorgosaurus, which sold for just over $6 million. It also sold the first standalone T Rex skull with \u201cMaximus\u201d in December 2022. Stan, the world\u2019s most complete Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton, set a new world record in 2020 when it sold for $31.8 million at Christie\u2019s. At the time of sale, paleontologists feared the fossil was lost to science, but in March the Abu Dhabi Department of Culture and Tourism revealed plans for Stan to be a star attraction at a new museum of natural history, expected to open in 2025 in Abu Dhabi, as CNN previously reported.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/style/stegosaurus-fossil-auction-scli-intl-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_31_middleeast_wfp-rafah-gaza-food-aid-intl-hnk", "text": "The United Nations food agency is unable to feed most civilians in Rafah, its local director warned Friday, with most border crossings closed amid what he described as \u201capocalyptic conditions\u201d and the Israeli military pushing further into Gaza\u2019s southernmost city. The World Food Programme (WFP) is currently serving only 27,000 people in\u00a0Rafah, according to Matthew Hollingworth, the organization\u2019s country director in Gaza. That\u2019s a tiny fraction of the roughly one million Gazans\u00a0who have been displaced from the area. \u201cThe sounds, the smells, the everyday life are horrific and apocalyptic,\u201d Hollingworth told journalists Friday after returning from a trip to Gaza. \u201cPeople sleep to the sounds of bombing, they sleep to the sounds of drones, they sleep to the sounds of war, as now tanks roll into parts of central\u00a0Rafah, which is only kilometers away. And they wake to the same sounds,\u201d said Hollingsworth. \u201cFrom the seventh of May to the 20th, not a single WFP truck crossed from the southern corridors of Egypt into\u00a0Rafah,\u201d he said. Rafah had previously been the central artery for aid to flow into Gaza, as the only border crossing not controlled by Israel. But since Israel seized control of the Gazan side of the Rafah crossing on May 7, aid has been blocked, with supplies piling up in Egypt and the enclave teetering close to\u00a0famine. Israel\u2019s military has continued to push further into Rafah, defying international concern and anger over its operations in the city. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said on Friday that its troops were in central Rafah \u2013\u00a0confirming\u00a0what eyewitnesses told CNN earlier this week, when tanks were spotted there for the first time since it entered the city in May. \u201cIDF\u00a0troops in central Rafah located Hamas rocket launchers, terror tunnel shafts, and weapons. The troops also dismantled a Hamas weapons storage facility in the area,\u201d the\u00a0IDF\u00a0said in the statement. On Wednesday, the Israeli military said it had established \u201coperational control\u201d over the Philadelphi Corridor, a 14-kilometer (8.7-mile) buffer zone on the Palestinian side of the Egypt-Gaza border. The IDF\u2019s operations in Rafah have prompted a 67% drop in the amount of humanitarian aid getting through, according to the UN. Gaza is now receiving a daily average of 58 aid trucks \u2013 down from the daily average of 176 trucks between April and May, which itself is far from the 500 trucks that used to enter Gaza each day before the war broke out in October. With Rafah now the epicenter of hostilities, aid has continued to trickle in from two other crossings: Kerem Shalom in the south and Erez in the north. CNN has contacted WFP to clarify whether it managed to send trucks via alternative land crossings. The IDF said 36 trucks were transferred on Thursday through Kerem Shalom and Erez West on behalf of the WFP. Hollingworth added that the WFP\u2019s warehouse in\u00a0Rafah, which was once capable of storing 2,700 tons of food, is no longer operational. \u201cWe do not have the supplies available to provide significant numbers of ready-to-eat ration boxes. We don\u2019t have significant supplies of wheat flour to hand out to those families that have a stove to cook on,\u201d Hollingworth said \u2013 but added they are providing around 400,000 hot meals to families in central\u00a0Rafah.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/middleeast/wfp-rafah-gaza-food-aid-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "world"}}

The move, which was quickly called out on social media, has been labeled by some as an attempt at censorship. \u201cAs the Palestinian people are already suffering great trauma and loss due to the vengeful regime of Netanyahu it is most unfortunate that a reputable publication like VF attempts to eliminate support that I or anyone chooses to offer,\u201d Pearce told CNN in an emailed statement. \u201cPersonally I think it is a disgrace.\u201d Pearce was featured in Vanity Fair France last week as part of a series of actor portraits at the 2024 Cannes Film Festival, which wrapped its 11-day stint on May 25 and where Pearce was supporting his new film \u201cThe Shrouds.\u201d Featured alongside stars like Sebastian Stan and\u00a0Bella Hadid, Pearce sported a black Yves Saint Laurent suit in his portrait, smiling straight at the camera. But social media sleuths detected an issue. A small Palestinian flag pin, which Pearce had been wearing on his lapel throughout Cannes, was missing from the photograph, though a different photo, featuring the pin, was posted to the magazine\u2019s Instagram the same day the article published. A white, red, black and green bracelet \u2014 the colors of the Palestinian flag \u2014 was still visible on his wrist. The sleuthing went viral on sites like X and TikTok, prompting the magazine to replace the un-edited photo and issue a correction to the article. An apology was also posted to social media on Sunday. \u201cWe have published by mistake a modified version of this photo on the site,\u201d the magazine wrote in French on X in response to a viral post criticizing the edited photo. \u201cThe original version was posted on Instagram the same day. We have rectified our mistake and we apologize.\u201d It\u2019s unclear why a modified version of the picture existed in the first place. Cond\u00e9 Nast, Vanity Fair\u2019s parent company, did not respond to CNN\u2019s requests for comment. Following the controversy, Pearce also reiterated his support for the Palestinian cause in a post on X, writing \u201cPalestinians are being murdered as we speak. Displaced, traumatised, ruined. The lives and futures of Palestinian children are being eradicated by a vengeful tyrant.\u201d Since October, more than 36,000 people in Gaza have been killed, according to the Ministry of Health in the enclave. Israel\u2019s military operation in Gaza started after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on October 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli authorities. Last weekend, Israel launched an airstrike on a refugee camp in Rafah, killing at least 45 people. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the civilian deaths a \u201ctragic error\u201d but would not cease the war, despite international condemnation.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/style/vanity-fair-france-guy-pearce-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_30_world_all-eyes-on-rafah-image-ai-cec", "text": "It\u2019s unclear exactly what the image is. A series of tents? Truck beds against a rust orange background? Multicolored rectangles? Mountains are visible in the background, and in the foreground are the following words: \u201cAll Eyes on Rafah\u201d \u2014\u00a0 a reference to the southernmost Gazan city that became the center of war coverage this week, after an Israeli strike on a refugee camp in the city, on what had been labeled a safe zone, killed dozens of already displaced Palestinians. In the wake of the attack, the aforementioned image has seemingly been everywhere. Likely created using artificial intelligence, the graphic \u2014 which is not an actual picture from Rafah or the war in Gaza \u2014 has been shared more than 46 million times on Instagram alone. It\u2019s become so ubiquitous, comedian Tim Dillon noted it\u2019s been shared like \u201cit\u2019s a new show on NBC.\u201d But the picture\u2019s popularity has raised questions and critiques on the passivity of the act. Eyes being on Rafah has not stopped the violence, wrote scientist Ayesha Khan on Instagram. Simply posting an ambiguous graphic is performative, Khan and others have noted. Still, the post\u2019s momentum has continued. Here\u2019s where the phrase comes from, where the graphic originated and what it could signal. Where did \u2018All Eyes on Rafah\u2019 come from? The phrase \u201cAll Eyes on Rafah\u201d has been appearing in various graphics and images associated with the war in Gaza for months and is not necessarily tied to this specific viral image. It likely originated from comments made in February by Rik Peeperkorn, who leads the World Health Organization\u2019s office in the West Bank and in Gaza. At the time, more than 1.5 million Palestinian refugees, many of whom had been fleeing from the north and the center parts of Gaza, were crammed into the southernmost city of Rafah, which was also undergoing a wave of Israeli airstrikes \u2014 attempts to \u201chit Hamas terrorists in the area,\u201d an IDF spokesperson said. \u201cAll eyes\u201d were on Rafah, Peeperkorn said, a phrase which then became widely used by activists and made its way into graphics, like the one currently going viral. Instagram credits user shahv4012 as the creator behind the story template, which includes a watermark to the account chaa.my, listed as his second account. The user behind the accounts did not respond to CNN\u2019s requests for comment. What makes this image so popular? There are a few aspects of this image that may have contributed to its popularity, noted Faiza Hirji, an associate professor at Ontario\u2019s McMaster University who studies race, religion and media. One is the image\u2019s inherent shareability. Because it\u2019s not an actual image of the violence, it\u2019s instead a more \u201csanitized\u201d rendering, Hirji told CNN, which means there\u2019s less risk of social media platforms suppressing it from being shared. This allows the image to circulate more readily than would actual images of war. Also, the way the image is being shared on Instagram \u2014 with a handy \u201cadd yours\u201d feature that allows users to easily repost the image onto their own personal stories \u2014 only aids in its viral success. The easier it is to share, the more likely it is that people will do so. Still, there\u2019s been some criticism of the image. To understand the graphic, the user would need to have some sense of what is actually happening in Rafah and would therefore know that the image being shared does not actually depict the violence and the scale of destruction taking place. For some, this could make the graphic more appealing, while others have argued that the image takes away from what is actually occurring on the ground. \u201cI think for some people, this also causes a kind of discomfort,\u201d Hirji said. \u201cBecause you\u2019re directing everyone\u2019s gaze to an image that doesn\u2019t really show the horror of what happens in conflict zones.\u201d What does \u2018All Eyes on Rafah\u2019 mean? Others have pointed out that the image does not actually include the words \u201cPalestine\u201d or \u201cGaza\u201d \u2014 names that have been widely politicized even before October 7. \u201cRafah does not have the immediate name recognition for people who haven\u2019t been paying attention,\u201d said writer Heben Nigatu on X. \u201cAre people Googling Rafah? Sharing without looking it up?\u201d Everybody likely has differing motivations behind sharing an image. For some, sharing the image might be a call for others to investigate what\u2019s happening in the region, and in Rafah specifically, Hirji said. Reposting the image could be a way to say to an audience: \u201cDon\u2019t look away. You can\u2019t pretend this isn\u2019t happening.\u201d Other interpretations are less charitable. Take for instance the argument that the graphic is a performative gesture, an image that can\u2019t be bothered to show the reality in Gaza with a vaguely political statement stamped atop \u2014 not dissimilar to the black squares posted on social media during the racial reckoning of 2020. But unlike debates about racism in the aftermath of George Floyd\u2019s murder, for many people in the West the war in Gaza is not happening close to home. This could make it difficult for people to feel empowered, Hirji said, in terms of their direct ability to affect the war\u2019s outcome. \u201cI think that many people are powerless and feel that powerlessness,\u201d she said. \u201cSome of it may be performative, but maybe they feel that the only action they can really take at this time is to at least raise awareness. And so this notion of \u2018All Eyes on Rafah,\u2019 if it can be a bit informative or educational, then perhaps there\u2019s a sense that this is the action they can take.\u201d And still, there are worries of \u201cslacktivism,\u201d the notion that all we need to do to change the world is share a single infographic enough times. \u201cWe need far more than performative rallies and symbolic protests that don\u2019t aim to disrupt anything,\u201d wrote Khan. \u201cBearing witness is still a passive act. And we shouldn\u2019t coddle ourselves pretending like a post a day \u2026 is substantial.\u201d The phrase itself \u2014 keeping \u201ceyes on\u201d a place \u2014 inherently prioritizes the audience rather than Rafah, creating a distance between the viewers and the victims. And still, Hirji said, even amid calls to not look away, the world often does so anyway. \u201cIt\u2019s important, you could say, that if nothing else, we acknowledge our complicity, or we acknowledge our inaction,\u201d Hirji said. \u201cThat\u2019s one interpretation.\u201d But there\u2019s another interpretation, too, which could be that audiences are setting themselves up as watchers to this trauma, Hirji noted, becoming both indifferent and inactive. History and research of past conflicts in parts of the Middle East or the Global South speak for itself, Hirji said \u2014 \u201coften so much of what we do is we watch, we judge, we comment,\u201d even while not knowing enough about the places we are watching or commenting on. \u201cAnd is that also a point that some people are trying to make by having this call out? To say: So we\u2019re watching it, now what?\u201d Hirji said. \u201cWhat happens after watching?\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/world/all-eyes-on-rafah-image-ai-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "world"}}

Occupying over a full square city block, the plaza was imagined as a vast mixed-use building project, offering city residents over 500 lavish condominiums, a five-star hotel, retail spaces, restaurants and a private 2-acre park. However, construction on the $1 billion project, which began in 2015, was shelved after the Chinese-backed contractor Oceanwide Holdings ran out of funding\u00a0in 2019 \u2014 and it has lain unfinished ever since. The plaza\u2019s status \u2014 and potential \u2014 as an eye-catching venue for their work spread by word of mouth within the graffiti community in recent months. Security at the site was known to be lax, an important detail as accessing the plaza\u2019s towers and other buildings constitutes trespassing. (The Los Angeles City Attorney confirmed to CNN that, as of April 3, criminal charges have been filed against 23 individuals, for violations including trespassing and possession of vandalism tools.) \u201cIt was like a gift from the graffiti gods\u2026 A giant canvas in the middle of downtown,\u201d tagger ENDEM told CNN, speaking on behalf of himself and his graffiti crew, NCT. \u201cWe were like, \u2018Let\u2019s do it right. Let\u2019s do it as if the whole world is going to see this.\u2019\u201d Historically, graffiti has often been used as protest art. While the practice dates back thousands of years, it\u2019s most commonly viewed in a contemporary context (within graffiti\u2019s \u201cmodern\u201d era, which dates back to the 1960s and 70s) as a creative vehicle for challenging societal norms and inequities \u2014 whether on the Berlin Wall in Germany or subway cars in New York City; whether painted by anonymous artists or well-known figures like Keith Haring or Banksy, even if the latter is, technically, anonymous himself. Still, neither ENDEM nor any of the other artists involved realized how famous their work on the Oceanside towers would become. Sharing his artwork on Instagram on January 31, a video from ENDEM quickly racked up tens of thousands of views: Vibrant images of bright block lettering splayed across the building\u2019s exterior paired with footage from the inside \u2014 the artist posing with shots of his spray paint cans, poised above the cityscape. The viral footage, among other visuals shared on social media, quickly opened the floodgates. Hitting Oceanside became a mark of credibility in the graffiti world; by mid-February, the number of tags and other graffiti pieces there were multiplying overnight. \u201cIt was an open house people going in and out. It was beautiful. It was like graffiti paradise,\u201d ENDEM said. \u201cIt felt exactly like the streets, but concentrated.\u201d Transformed in part into an art installation, Oceanwide became an opportunity for the graffiti artists to leave a message to the city below, and a call-out to policy makers who leave buildings to rot. \u201cGraffiti shows you where the city hurts,\u201d Roger Gastman, owner and founder of the LA-based arts organization Beyond the Streets, told CNN. Renowned for its large-scale exhibitions, immersive educational programs, pop-up events and partnerships, Beyond the Streets works to educate and celebrate the diverse dimensions of graffiti as a medium. To him, the mission of graffiti is clear: to challenge, educate, and redefine public perception of the medium. Earl Ofari Hutchinson, president of The Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable, a nonpartisan public policy forum\u00a0for civic participation and education,\u00a0sees the abandoned towers as amplifying the social issues of the community they are situated in, connecting the graffiti-laden structures to the urban blight that surrounds them in LA\u2019s Skid Row. Skid Row is a 50-block sector of downtown LA where between 8,000 and 11,000 unhoused people live in challenging, often squalid conditions. \u201cYou\u2019ve got tens of thousands of people displaced because of over urban development. And as a result of that, they\u2019re on the streets,\u201d Hutchinson told CNN, noting that the homeless population in Los Angeles is continuing to grow. (The Los Angeles Housing Services Authority reports a 9% increase in homelessness in LA county in 2023 and a 10% increase in the city from 2022.) \u201cNow, set right in the middle of that, you have\u2026 a development that will never be completed.\u201d \u201cWhat you have here is a classic urban nightmare brought on by very poor policies \u2014 fiscal, financial, budgetary and political problems (in) a city that has just gone off the rails in terms of over-development and lack of affordability,\u201d Hutchinson added. Still, Hutchinson is no fan of the graffiti either. To him, and many other LA residents who have said they disapprove of the \u201cvandalism,\u201d the plaza is a sore sight for eyes. \u201cThe problem is you\u2019re talking about violating public space and with no permission\u2026 that doesn\u2019t fly with me,\u201d Hutchinson said. \u201cThe fact of the matter is, the public has not given you approval. (And) the general public has to pay for the removal.\u201d Costs currently borne by the taxpayer at the Oceanwide Plaza site include the security details provided by the LAPD as well as the graffiti cleanup Hutchinson highlights. (\u201cThis has strained our deployment,\u201d LAPD Chief Michel Moore said during a February meeting of the Los Angeles City Council. \u201cWe have called in some officers on an overtime basis so that we can provide for these added patrols or station them at that site to deter vandals and others from gaining access.\u201d) Clean teams working in the neighborhoods surrounding Oceanwide remove on average some 2,000 square feet of graffiti per week, with that figure growing in recent months. \u201cPeople forget that people live here. People own businesses here and they don\u2019t want to have to spend the time and money to clean it up,\u201d said Blair Besten, executive director of the Historic Core of Downtown Los Angeles, an organization which works to improve the quality of life in downtown neighborhoods. The Historic Core prioritizes street sweeping, trash collection \u2014 and graffiti removal. \u201cI would hardly call what they\u2019re doing art,\u201d Besten argued of the Oceanwide taggers. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty sloppy and quick. They come in fast and they knock it out and they leave.\u201d But to Gastman, graffiti is a powerful form of expression, and a call-to-action \u2014 particularly for those who emanate from struggles within home life, gang life or societal turmoil. Graffiti culture can offer an unexpected support system for those the city has abandoned, Gastman said. It becomes a platform for them to make their voices heard. \u201cIn graffiti culture, a lot of us know each other. We\u2019re all friends. We have the same mentality \u2014 we\u2019re just trying to get up. We\u2019re just trying to get noticed,\u201d explained ENDEM. In the midst of an addiction that led to his rock bottom, graffiti became his lifeline, he explained. \u201cI was at my lowest of lows, still trying to stay sober, I needed some type of outlet,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cGraffiti is something that you can hold on to. Its bigger than me, its everyone, it\u2019s a community.\u201d In this, ENDEM believes that the beauty of Oceanwide isn\u2019t tangible. Rather, it lies in the birth of a new generation of graffiti writers. \u201cThey can erase the graffiti on buildings, but they can never erase the impact that it has on the city of Los Angeles and the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to it. Yes, it\u2019s vandalism. Yes, it\u2019s art, and it\u2019s everything in between,\u201d Gastman concluded. \u201cThis is a real culture. It\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/10/style/graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_28_americas_turks-and-caicos-ammunition-american-sentencing-tuesday", "text": "American Tyler Wenrich was sentenced to three weeks in jail and fined Tuesday after he pleaded guilty earlier this month to possession of ammunition while traveling to Turks and Caicos. The Virginia resident was fined $9,000, Kimo Tynes, the director of communications for the Government of the Turks and Caicos Islands, said in a statement. Since he had already served three weeks in jail, the court recognized it as time served, so his prison sentence is complete, the release said. The 31-year-old American faced as much as a 12-year prison sentence. But the Hon. Justice Davidson Baptiste cited exceptional circumstances in Wenrich\u2019s case and said, \u201cEnforcing the mandatory minimum would have been arbitrary and disproportionate, and would not serve the public interest.\u201d Wenrich returned to Virginia on Thursday, arriving at the Richmond International Airport, CNN affiliate WWBT reported. Another American charged with possession of ammunition, Ryan Tyler Watson, pleaded guilty Tuesday, according to Tynes. Watson\u2019s sentencing is scheduled for June 21. Watson and Wenrich are among five Americans arrested in Turks and Caicos in recent months, all accused of bringing various amounts of ammunition to the 40-island chain southeast of the Bahamas. Bringing firearms or ammunition into Turks and Caicos without prior permission from police is \u201cstrictly forbidden,\u201d according to a\u00a0statement\u00a0from its government. In the Turks and Caicos, possession of firearms or ammunition carries a minimum 12-year sentence, though the law allows reduced sentences under \u201cexceptional circumstances.\u201d  Even though the territory doesn\u2019t manufacture firearms or ammunition, the number of firearms finding their way to the islands has increased, Misick said. Meanwhile, the United States has\u00a0more guns than people. On Friday, American Bryan Hagerich of Pennsylvania pleaded guilty and received a 52-week sentence\u00a0suspended for one year\u00a0and a $6,700 fine, his representatives said. He returned to the United States after paying the fine. In addition to Hagerich and Wenrich, one other American \u2013 Michael Lee Evans \u2013 pleaded guilty to possession of ammunition while traveling in Turks and Caicos, according to the territory\u2019s government. Evans was allowed to return to the US over a \u201csevere\u201d medical situation, but will be required to return to Turks and Caicos for his next hearing, attorney Oliver Smith told CNN. The rest remain in Turks and Caicos. A fifth American, Sharitta Shinese Grier, was arrested last week and is awaiting trial after making bail, according to Tynes\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b, with the Office of the Premier and Public Policy. The mandatory minimum 12-year sentence for possession of firearms or ammunition is in place to protect those on the islands, and judges may use their discretion to impose reduced sentences, Turks and Caicos Gov. Dileeni Daniel-Selvaratnam said. US citizens are not being targeted, Turks and Caicos officials said. Of the 195 people sentenced for firearm-related offenses over the past six years, only seven were US citizens, Misick said Thursday. No US citizen has received the 12-year sentence to date.
