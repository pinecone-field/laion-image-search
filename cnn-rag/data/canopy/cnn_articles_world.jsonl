{"id": "2024_07_22_middleeast_benjamin-netanyahu-washington-dc-visit-mime-intl", "text": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu landed in Washington on Monday to far less fanfare than he would have expected just a day earlier. His highly-anticipated visit \u2013 chock-full of meetings with top US officials and a prized address to Congress \u2013 will now undoubtedly be overshadowed by US President Joe Biden\u2019s stunning decision to drop out of the presidential race. But as detailed ceasefire negotiations aimed at turning a framework agreement into a final deal stretch into their third week, Netanyahu\u2019s visit will still be critical to the prospects of a ceasefire in Gaza. Senior US officials say a deal is within reach,\u00a0but the prospects of a deal\u00a0may hinge on the answer to one key question: Does Netanyahu actually want a deal? The conventional wisdom in Israeli media, politics and on the streets of Tel Aviv would tell you that the answer to that question is no \u2013 that Netanyahu has much more to gain by prolonging the war and much more to lose by ending it. The war has allowed Netanyahu to delay his share of accountability for the failures leading up to\u00a0the\u00a0October 7\u00a0attacks, rebuffing calls for new elections with stiff wartime resolve. His party\u2019s prospects in the next election have actually improved in recent months. And the right-wing coalition partners keeping him in power have threatened to bolt if Netanyahu cuts a deal that ends the war. Even Biden\u00a0has said \u201cthere is every reason\u201d for people to believe Netanyahu is prolonging the war in Gaza in order to stay in power. There are also indications that Netanyahu is throwing up eleventh-hour obstacles to reaching a deal. He reneged on a key Israeli concession regarding allowing Palestinians unrestricted access to northern Gaza that was included in Israel\u2019s latest ceasefire proposal and now appears to be insisting on Israel maintaining control of the Philadelphi Corridor, a 14km strip of land that serves\u00a0as\u00a0a buffer zone on the border between Egypt and Gaza. And publicly, his rhetoric has undermined confidence in Israel\u2019s commitment to reaching a deal that could end the war. And yet, Netanyahu and his negotiating team have also steadily engaged in negotiations, exchanging proposals with Hamas and bringing the two sides closer than ever to a potential deal. A growing share of the Israeli public, led by hostage families, is demanding the government strike a deal. Shortly after arriving in Washington, Netanyahu met with family members of the hostages held in Gaza and said a deal to secure their release could be near. \u201cThe conditions to bring them back are ripe, for the simple reason that we are putting very strong pressure on Hamas,\u201d Netanyahu said Monday, according to a statement from his office. But one of the family members told Israeli media that the meeting with Netanyahu was \u201cnot a dialogue\u201d adding that the timing of his visit was \u201cnot appropriate,\u201d given the displacement of Israelis in the north and south of the country and the fact that a ceasefire deal has still not been struck. \u201cWe tried to ask the prime minister a number of questions. He did not so much address the questions but really gave some sort of overview of his own,\u201d said Ruby Chen, the father of Itay Chen, a 19-year-old US-Israeli soldier who was killed on October 7 and whose body was taken to Gaza. Netanyahu\u2019s allies insist he is earnest in his desire to strike a hostage release deal \u2013 just the right deal, one that could allow Israel to resume fighting in Gaza. That tension will be inescapable now Netanyahu has arrived in Washington, where he has often sought to bolster Israel\u2019s standing in the US as well as his own political standing at home. While Netanyahu will look to showcase the support he still has in\u00a0Washington (and a standing ovation from a majority of lawmakers in Congress should do the trick), his visit is also an opportunity for top US officials and lawmakers to push, prod, nudge and cajole him toward a deal \u2013 in both public and private. Chief among those eager to make that case will be the US president, who will meet face-to-face with Netanyahu this week\u00a0for the first time since Biden flew to Israel in October in a dramatic show of wartime support. The warmth and sympathy that filled the air during that October visit is likely to be replaced by something much frostier. Biden has grown steadily more critical of Israel\u2019s war in Gaza \u2013 where\u00a0more than\u00a039,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health \u2013 and Netanyahu has resisted US pressure, often publicly thumbing his nose at the White House. Even as he has maintained strong support for Israel, Biden became the first president since Ronald Reagan to withhold some US munitions to Israel \u2013 suspending shipments of 2,000-pound bombs in May amid concerns about civilian casualties in Gaza. Netanyahu, meanwhile, has not only resisted US calls to rein in Israeli military operations in Gaza, but has used his defiance of the White House\u2019s calls for restraint to bolster his political standing in Israel \u2013 including in a speech just days before his trip to the US in which he talked up his refusal to bow to Biden\u2019s pressure to wind down the war and abandon a planned offensive in Rafah. Biden\u2019s decision to drop out of the presidential race just two days before he sits down with Netanyahu will unquestionably shift the dynamic between the two men even further \u2013 exactly how remains to be seen. Netanyahu will be the first foreign leader to sit down with the now effectively lame duck president \u2013 albeit one who still has six months in office during which he will continue to steer US foreign policy. Loosened from the constraints of electoral politics and with a keener eye on his legacy, how will Biden now approach Netanyahu, the future of the war in Gaza and US policy toward Israel? And to what extent will Netanyahu feel compelled to heed Biden\u2019s pressure? As the Israeli prime minister weighs that new dynamic, Netanyahu \u2013 a keen observer of US politics \u2013 may be looking to someone else\u00a0as he decides whether to take a leap toward a ceasefire: former US President Donald Trump. Trump has a track record of unflinching support for Israel and has been critical of Biden\u2019s efforts to rein in Israel\u2019s conduct in Gaza. During his speech at the Republican National Convention, he warned that the hostages \u201cbetter be back before I assume office, or you will be paying a very big price.\u201d But Trump in April also urged Israel to get its war in Gaza \u201cover with, and get it over with fast.\u201d And Netanyahu no longer enjoys the cozy relationship he once had with Trump. \u201cThe first person to congratulate Biden was Bibi (Netanyahu). And not only did he congratulate him, he did it on tape,\u201d Trump told CNN analyst Barak Ravid in 2021. \u201cHe was very early\u00a0\u2014 like, earlier than most. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since. F**k him.\u201d Netanyahu will have plenty of opportunities to assess whether that sentiment still stands as he meets with Trump allies in Washington this week. There are currently no known plans for\u00a0him to meet\u00a0with Trump.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/22/middleeast/benjamin-netanyahu-washington-dc-visit-mime-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_16_europe_trump-vp-jd-vance-europe-ukraine-intl", "text": "Many of America\u2019s closest allies were already dreading the prospect of Donald Trump\u2019s return to the White House. Now that the former president has picked JD Vance as his running mate, they potentially have a lot more to worry about. By choosing Vance, Trump has sent a clear signal that, if elected, his America-first foreign policy will be back in force. Vance, a junior senator for Ohio, is a staunch critic of sending support to Ukraine as it tries to defend itself against Russia. Like Trump, he has repeatedly criticized NATO and its European members for not spending enough on defense. And he has made a number of comments that have raised eyebrows across the pond \u2013 including when he said the United Kingdom would become the \u201cfirst truly Islamist country that will get a nuclear weapon\u201d under the new Labour government. His nomination puts an end to the hopes by some of America\u2019s allies that Trump might soften his foreign policy stance if reelected. That hope was fueled by Trump himself. While he has often repeated his claim that he \u201cwould end the war\u201d in Ukraine in one day if reelected and said he would not send any more money to Kyiv, he stopped short of getting his allies in Congress to block the $61 billion aid package approved earlier this year. \u201cHe could have told members (of the Congress) not to vote for it and instead he tacitly allowed it\u00a0to go through,\u201d said Kristine Berzina, a geopolitics and security expert who leads the German Marshall Fund of the United States\u2019 Geostrategy North program. \u201cSo there was a sense in Washington that Trump has been in a fairly pro-Ukrainian moment, and that he should have the benefit of the doubt \u2013 perhaps his views on Europe and Ukraine have evolved, especially given the much higher defense spending in Europe now,\u201d she\u00a0told CNN in an interview. But with the selection of his running mate, Trump dashed these hopes. \u201cJD Vance does not appear to be interested in being a good ally to Europe,\u201d Berzina said. At the Munich Security Conference in February, Vance suggested Ukraine should negotiate with Russia because the US and other allies do not have the capacity to support it. Ukraine and NATO have dismissed that scenario, because it would most likely mean Kyiv would have to give up some of its pre-war territory. \u201cI think what\u2019s reasonable to accomplish is some negotiated peace. I think Russia has incentive to come to the table right now. I think Ukraine, Europe and the United States have incentives to come to the table,\u201d he said at the conference, adding that the fact that Putin \u201cis a bad guy does not mean we can\u2019t engage in basic diplomacy.\u201d On Wednesday, Russia welcomed Vance\u2019s stance on Ukraine. \u201cHe (Vance) stands for peace, for cessation of aid. We can only welcome this because, in fact, it is necessary to stop pumping Ukraine with weapons, and the war will end,\u201d Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told a press conference at the United Nations. Lavrov added that Russia \u201cwill be ready to work with any American leader elected by the American people\u201d as long as this leader \u201cis ready for an equitable, mutually respectful dialogue.\u201d In Munich, Vance notably skipped a key meeting between a bipartisan delegation of US senators and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, saying he didn\u2019t think he\u2019d learn anything new there. He did attend a meeting with Zelensky in Washington in December but left early. Asked by CNN\u2019s Kaitlin Collins about Vance\u2019s assertion that the outcome of the war would not change even if Ukraine received US funding, Zelensky said Vance did \u201cnot understand what is going on here.\u201d \u201cTo understand it is to come to the frontline to see what\u2019s going on\u2026 without this support. And he will understand that millions of people will be killed,\u201d he added. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t understand it, of course, God bless you don\u2019t have the war on your territory.\u201d Pivot to China Vance has argued that the US should turn its focus away from Russia and toward\u00a0East Asia. Earlier this week, he said the war in Ukraine must be brought to a \u201crapid close\u201d so that America could focus on \u201cthe real issue, which is China.\u201d That\u2019s the \u201cbiggest threat to our country and we\u2019re completely distracted from it,\u201d Vance said in an interview with Fox News Monday. In an op-ed published in the New York Times in April, Vance also argued that US efforts to supply Ukraine with air defense systems could be detrimental to Taiwan\u2019s defense in the event of a Chinese invasion of the self-ruled island claimed by Beijing. \u201cThese weapons are not only needed by Ukraine. If China were to set its sights on Taiwan, the Patriot missile system would be critical to its defense,\u201d he wrote. The idea that East Asia, and China specifically, poses as big, if not a bigger, threat to the US than Russia is not unique to Vance. Trevor McCrisken, an US foreign policy expert and associate professor at the University of Warwick, said there is bipartisan agreement between Democrats and Republicans that China is the biggest threat internationally to US interests. \u201cBoth parties say you\u2019ve got to be strong, and you\u2019ve got to prevent China from fulfilling whatever ambitions it might have, economically, militarily, and so on. It\u2019s just that most Democrats and the more moderate Republicans believe that Russia is also a threat,\u201d he told CNN in an interview. In the eyes of most Western leaders, the threats from China and Russia go hand in hand. Just last week, NATO leaders called China a \u201cdecisive enabler\u201d of Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine in the alliance\u2019s most forceful statement on Beijing\u2019s involvement in the conflict. \u201cTo have a rather simplistic view that if you back away from Ukraine that\u2019s going to help you with China, it might not be the case,\u201d McCrisken said, adding that Vance is likely trying to use his more anti-European stance for political reasons too. \u201cIt is a way of painting Europe as not standing up for itself when it should. Historically, the US has had to go in and bail out Europe so many times.\u201d Sam Greene, the director of the Democratic Resilience Program at the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA) and a professor of Russian politics at King\u2019s College London, said Vance\u2019s nomination should make it clear to America\u2019s allies that the shift toward the Trumpian kind of Republican foreign policy is likely more long-term. \u201cThe last time we had a Trump presidency, I think Europeans looked at this as potentially a four-year blip, and then breathed a sigh of relief when Biden was elected and thought that we\u2019d return to normal \u2026 and I think that there was some wishful thinking in that, and people have now begun to recognize that,\u201d he said. The effect of this shift, Greene said, is apparent even now \u2013 despite the White House being in Democratic hands. US President Joe Biden had an extremely hard time getting the latest Ukraine aid package through Congress, forcing Ukraine\u2019s European allies to start thinking about a plan B. The initial delay in Congress approving the package resulted in a Czech-led initiative to find and fund alternative sources of ammunition for Kyiv, among other efforts to look for assistance elsewhere. \u201cThe unreliability of American leadership in Europe has been a fact that Europeans have now had some time to get used to. Even if Biden is reelected, America will be difficult to rely on,\u201d Greene said. If Trump chose someone with a more traditional foreign policy stance to be a running mate \u2013 for example the former UN ambassador Nikki Haley, America\u2019s allies could have hoped that post-Trump, the Republican party might pivot back to what Greene called \u201ctrans-Atlantic solidarity.\u201d \u201cBut if in fact, not only are we looking at another Trump administration, but we\u2019re looking at a future of the Republican Party that is dominated by people like JD Vance, then that is a much more sobering prospect for Europe,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/europe/trump-vp-jd-vance-europe-ukraine-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "world"}}

A local official, Habtamu Fetena, had earlier told state-run broadcaster, the Ethiopian Broadcasting Corporation (EBC) that children were among the dead and the death toll was likely to increase. Officials said heavy rainfall had caused two landslides. Many people were buried in the first one; a second then claimed the lives of several people helping the rescue efforts, according to Reuters.

The South African Police Service (SAPS) and the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation, commonly known as Hawks, raided the property in the town of Groblersdal after receiving information suspicious activity was taking place there, SAPS said in a statement. After searching four structures on the property, police found large quantities of chemicals used to make illicit drugs including acetone and crystal meth, with an estimated street value of 2 billion South African rand ($109.4 million).

{"id": "2024_07_23_americas_analysis-venezuela-election-maduro-intl-latam", "text": "It would be easy to dismiss this Sunday\u2019s presidential election in Venezuela as a fait accompli. The country\u2019s opposition movement is challenging Nicolas Maduro, a strongman who has ruled Venezuela since 2013 and has made clear he intends to keep doing so \u2013 saying last week that if he were not re-elected, Venezuela might face a \u201cbloodbath.\u201d Maduro\u2019s government controls all public institutions in Venezuela, and it has been accused of rigging votes in the past, most notably in 2017, when electoral authorities briefly showed the opposition had won a gubernatorial race \u2013 only to revert its decision in favor of the government candidate, an episode widely referred to as a glaring example of electoral fraud. In the run-up to this election, a new report by local NGO\u00a0Laboratorio de Paz\u00a0says\u00a0there have been more than 70 arbitrary detentions since the election campaign formally began on July 4. And yet, uncertainty is the mantra in Caracas these days. The opposition campaign has re-energized its bases, and the candidature of Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez has attracted widespread support in Venezuela and abroad. There\u2019s widespread agreement that Maduro\u2019s government is facing its toughest electoral moment in the last 25 years. The stakes are high \u2013 both here and abroad. A chance to rebuild Venezuela\u2019s economic power \u201cOn the ballot is how long it\u2019ll take to fix Venezuela\u2019s economy,\u201d said Asdrubal Oliveros, founder of Caracas firm Ecoanalitica, in his\u00a0weekly podcast\u00a0on July 8. Under Maduro, oil-rich Venezuela has suffered the worst economic crash in a peacetime country in recent history. Once the fifth-largest economy in Latin America, today Venezuela\u2019s economy has shrunk to the equivalent of a medium-sized city, smaller than say, Milwaukee,\u00a0according to data from the IMF. After years of chronic shortages, most basic goods are widely available in Venezuela, but too expensive for most people to buy. Today, minimum wage is about three dollars per month, supplemented with the equivalent of $40 in government benefits, such as food stamps and subsidized gasoline, and more than eight out of 10 Venezuelans live below the poverty line, according to an independent survey by the Andres Bello Catholic University in Caracas. While the opposition claims the crash is due to Maduro\u2019s policies and chronic corruption, Maduro argues Venezuela has been the victim of \u201ceconomic war,\u201d including widespread US sanctions on oil, a crucial Venezuelan export, which were imposed in 2019, when Venezuela\u2019s economy was already on the floor. But a Gonzalez win could change that \u2013 particularly if the United States lifts its sanctions to welcome the democratic regime. Venezuela holds the largest oil reserves in the world. If elected, Gonzalez aims to make Venezuela \u201cthe energy hub of the Americas.\u201d Geopolitical fallout expected On the international front, the vote\u2019s outcome is expected to be\u00a0felt across the Americas \u2013 including the United States \u2013 in the form of migration. As Venezuela\u2019s economy has crumbled, around eight million Venezuelans have already fled their country, many of them scattered across South America. A recent survey from Venezuelan pollster ORC Consultores found that more than 18% of the respondents plan to migrate from the country by the end of the year if Maduro wins. On the other hand, a win by Gonzalez and the democratic opposition would be a historic event, swinging the geopolitical pendulum in Latin America and beyond. The Maduro government is a staunch ally to China, Iran and Russia. Less than 1,400 miles from Miami, Caracas is often touted as a bridgehead for Russian President Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Washington\u2019s backyard. Another regional ally, Cuba, currently receives free shipments of Venezuelan crude to sustain its industries. Under Maduro, Venezuela has also grown increasingly isolated, quitting regional forums such as the Organization of American States, and its membership of the Mercosur, Latin America\u2019s largest economic union, has been suspended. Gonzalez, a twentieth-century diplomat who\u2019s lived in Algiers, Brussels and Buenos Aires and speaks English and French on top of his native Spanish, would be expected to turn toward democratic governments in the region, including Washington, and work to rebuild international ties. He also plans to kindle ties with multilateral organizations such as the IMF, the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank, to bring in much-needed cash to subsidize the economy, at least in the short term,\u00a0according to the opposition\u2019s economic platform. Currently, most state institutions, such as the Supreme Court and the Attorney General, are in the hands of regime loyalists \u2013 but Gonzalez has said he intends to depoliticize those positions and free political prisoners.\u00a0In an interview earlier this year with CNN, the candidate said he wishes to \u201cre-institutionalize\u201d the Venezuelan state after 20 years of economic and social collapse. And that is, perhaps, the highest stake in Sunday\u2019s election. Recent years have been described as a crisis for democracy, from Brexit to the rise of neofascism in Europe; from eroding democracies in India, Turkey, the Philippines and all over the global south, to the rise of Donald Trump as US president and now reelection candidate. But a new dawn in Caracas would be proof that representative democracy is still attractive enough to those who don\u2019t enjoy it.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/23/americas/analysis-venezuela-election-maduro-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_15_africa_rwanda-election-polls-open-intl", "text": "Rwandans lined up on Monday to elect their next president, with early results putting incumbent Paul Kagame in the lead in a vote widely expected\u00a0to give him a fourth term and extend his near quarter century in charge of the East African country. The two men standing against him \u2013 Frank Habineza from the Democratic Green Party and independent Philippe Mpayimana \u2013 said they were hoping to make some progress, but analysts and rights groups said Kagame\u2019s overwhelming victory was all but certain. Kagame, who got more than 93% of the vote at the last three elections, won praise from Western and regional leaders at the time for helping end\u00a0the 1994 genocide in\u00a0Rwanda. The US State Department and others have also lauded the development of the economy. Rwandans are also voting on Monday for members of the lower house of parliament and provisional results are expected by July 20. Polling stations were open until 3 p.m. (1300 GMT). The overall voter turnout was 98% of the 9 million registered voters, Oda Gasinzigwa, chair of the National Electoral Commission, said in a statement on the national broadcaster later on Monday evening. Of 78.94% of the votes counted at about 2017 GMT, Kagame was ahead with 99.15% of the votes, data from the commission showed. Campaign groups, including Human Rights Watch, have accused authorities of cracking down on journalists, the opposition and civil society groups before the vote. Kagame has dismissed such accusations and described himself as the stability candidate. His reelection could signal a measure of political stability for his corner of a fractured region, but also continued global scrutiny, given the accusations of abuses and of\u00a0supporting rebels\u00a0in neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo \u2013 a charge he has also denied. Earlier on Monday, at the Rwandexco polling center in the capital Kigali, Barimukije Pheneas said he would vote for the 66-year-old incumbent. \u201cWe voted smoothly without any crowding, and we are happy,\u201d Pheneas said. \u201cI voted for Paul Kagame because he has achieved a lot for us; he united us.\u201d Motorcycle taxi driver Karangwa Vedaste said the voting process was calm and peaceful, but declined to say who he had chosen. \u201cI voted for a leader I trust. The one I voted for is a secret in my heart. We will share it when he wins,\u201d Vedaste said. The electoral commission barred eight other candidates, including Kagame\u2019s most vocal critics, from running, citing a range of reasons including missing and incomplete registration documents. Democratic Green Party candidate Habineza, whose deputy was found dead and almost beheaded in the run-up to the 2010 vote, said there had been signs of progress. \u201cWe toured the entire country, and wherever we went, people welcomed us warmly. They gave us gifts and assured us they would vote for us,\u201d Habineza said after voting. \u201cWe have to maintain this momentum and not regress,\u201d he added. \u201cWe are confident, each of us is confident, it\u2019s half and half,\u201d independent presidential candidate Mpayimana told journalists after casting his vote. The US State Department says on its website\u00a0Rwanda\u00a0has made \u201cprogress in developing national and local government institutions, economic development, maintaining security (and) promoting reconciliation.\u201d It also says it backs\u00a0Rwanda\u00a0efforts to \u201cincrease democratic participation (and) enhance respect for civil and political rights.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/africa/rwanda-election-polls-open-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "world"}}

The development on the tap-to-pay technology underscores mounting regulatory scrutiny of Apple (AAPL) in the European Union, where it is also facing a potential huge fine for allegedly breaching the bloc\u2019s landmark Digital Markets Act. The European Commission, the EU\u2019s executive arm, announced this and other changes to Apple\u2019s business practices Thursday, saying they would open up competition in mobile payments on iPhones. \u201ciPhone users will (now) be able to use their preferred mobile wallet for payments in stores\u2026 while enjoying all the iPhone functionalities, including double click, tap-and-go and Face ID,\u201d the EU\u2019s competition chief Margrethe Vestager told journalists. The tech giant has until July 25 to implement the changes, which will remain in force for 10 years and apply throughout the 30 countries in the European Economic Area.

Apple will also allow iPhone users to choose which mobile wallet to make the default wallet on their phones. \u201cApple is providing developers in the European Economic Area with an option to enable NFC contactless payments and\u00a0contactless\u00a0transactions for car keys, closed loop transit, corporate badges, home keys, hotel keys, merchant loyalty/rewards, and event tickets\u00a0from within their iOS apps,\u201d Apple said in a statement shared with CNN. \u201cApple Pay and Apple Wallet will continue to be available in the European Economic Area for users and developers.\u201d The European Commission first raised objections against Apple\u2019s tap-to-pay practices in 2022, having opened a formal antitrust investigation into Apple Pay two years earlier. The regulators found that Apple had abused its dominant market position by restricting access to the NFC technology needed to make payments on mobile devices. That means rivals wanting to create apps or wallets using the tap-to-pay features on iPhones have been unable to do so and users have been forced to use Apple Pay for mobile payments. \u201cFrom now on, Apple can no longer use its control of the iPhone ecosystem to keep (competing) mobile wallets out of the market,\u201d Vestager said. \u201cCompeting wallet developers as well as consumers will benefit from these changes, opening up innovation and choice while keeping payments secure.\u201d The commitments do not extend to Apple Watches, however. \u201cOur impression was that the number of people who use Apple Watches for payments is rather small,\u201d said Vestager, adding that there was \u201climited harm done\u201d from excluding those devices.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/tech/apple-pay-europe-mobile-wallets/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "world"}}

Hungary\u2019s far-right Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n has ruffled feathers among EU leaders by claiming recently that the union has a \u201cpro-war policy.\u201d Borrell responded to Orban\u2019s comment during a press conference in Brussels, saying, \u201cI understood that we have to send a signal, even if it is a symbolic signal, that being against the foreign policy of the European Union and disqualifying the policy of the European Union as the \u2018party of war\u2019 has to have some consequences.\u201d \u201cWe analyzed the statements and the actions implemented\u201d by the Hungarian prime minister and foreign minister, the chief diplomat of the EU said. \u201cI can say that all member states, with one single exception, were very much critical about this behavior,\u201d he added. \u201cEuropean Union policy is not a pro-war policy. We strongly rejected that,\u201d Borrel said, adding, \u201cthe only one who is pro-war is Putin.\u201d The informal EU Council meetings of foreign and defense ministers were due to take place in Budapest from August 28 to 30, according to the EU council website, with Hungary currently holding the rotating European Union presidency. Borrell\u2019s decision comes after European Council President Charles Michel firmly hit back at Orb\u00e1n\u2019s claim that the EU has led a \u201cpro-war policy\u201d in a letter published last week. \u201cRussia is the aggressor and Ukraine is the victim exercising its legitimate right to self-defense. Russia is leading a war of aggression in blatant violation of international law, Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity and sovereignty in accordance with the UN Charter,\u201d Michel wrote. Orb\u00e1n further upset EU lawmakers with his recent so-called \u201cpeace missions\u201d at the beginning of July \u2013 meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow, Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Beijing, and most recently former US President Donald Trump at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida. The authoritarian Hungarian leader has sought to cast himself as a peacemaker in the Ukraine conflict, but his stance is at odds with most EU leaders, who have pledged unequivocal support for Ukraine as it attempts to repel Russia\u2019s military effort. In his letter to those leaders, Orban said that during the meetings there was a \u201cgeneral observation\u201d that \u201cthe intensity of the military conflict\u201d in Ukraine \u201cwill radically escalate in the near future.\u201d A letter signed by over 63 European lawmakers, addressed to the three EU chiefs, said Orban had \u201ccaused significant damage\u201d through his meetings. They called on the bloc\u2019s leaders to suspend Hungary\u2019s voting rights in the European Council, arguing that \u201cmere verbal condemnation\u201d of Hungary has \u201cno effect.\u201d European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen later slammed the Hungarian prime minister\u2019s visit to Moscow as an \u201cappeasement mission.\u201d In response, Orb\u00e1n told CNN he was simply fulfilling his \u201cChristian duty\u201d by visiting Putin. \u201cIf you have a position and you can have an impact on bad things to improve it, you have to do so,\u201d Orban told CNN last week.

The female pilot, who was not named in the Navy release, was flying an F/A-18 Super Hornet off the aircraft carrier USS Dwight D Eisenhower as part of Strike Fighter Squadron 32, nicknamed the \u201cFlying Swordsmen.\u201d The aerial victory came against a one-way Houthi attack drone, one of dozens the Yemen-based group has deployed against civilian merchant ships in the Red Sea and nearby waters in reaction to the destruction in Gaza during Israel\u2019s war against Hamas, a release from Carrier Strike Group 2 said. The squadron amassed more than 3,000 combat hours in flying almost 1,500 combat missions as part of operations Inherent Resolve and Prosperity Guardian, the former targeting ISIS and the latter stood up in December 2023 to respond to the Houthi-led attacks on international shipping. The Swordsmen, one of four strike fighter squadrons that deployed on the Eisenhower, fired more than 20 air-to-air missiles against the Houthi drones during those missions, the Navy said. \u201cDuring one mission, VFA-32 became home to the first American female pilot to engage and kill an air-to-air contact,\u201d it said. The first air-to-air victory by a female pilot comes 30 years after Lt. Kara Hultgreen became the first carrier-based female fighter pilot in the Navy, flying the F-14 Tomcat off the USS Abraham Lincoln that year. Female aviators also joined the Eisenhower in 1994. The Eisenhower-led carrier strike group returned to US bases on July 14 after a nine-month deployment, an exceptionally lengthy deployment for a carrier. Normal deployments last about six to eight months. Cmdr. Jason Hoch, commanding officer of VFA-32, praised the squadron\u2019s performance in \u201cincredibly demanding conditions\u201d during the deployment. Besides the air-to-air encounters, the Swordsmen led two of seven strikes against Houthi ground targets in Yemen, destroying munitions and command and control facilities, the release said. \u201cWe proved over and over again that the flexibility a carrier strike group brings to the fight is unmatched,\u201d Hoch said. Overall, Carrier Strike Group 2, which besides the Eisenhower included the guided missile cruiser USS Philippine Sea and the destroyers USS Mason and USS Gravely, hit more than 460 Houthi targets in Yemen, according to the Navy. The group\u2019s warships fired 155 standard missiles and 135 Tomahawk land-attack missiles during those strikes, while the strike group\u2019s aircraft fired 60 air-to-air missiles and released 420 air-to-surface weapons, the Navy said. The Houthis are an Iran-backed Shia rebel group that controls swathes of Yemen, one of the poorest countries in the Middle East and a nation that has been ravaged by years of civil war. Since Hamas\u2019 attacks on October 7 and Israel\u2019s subsequent ground and air offenses in Gaza, the Houthis say they have been seeking revenge against Israel for its military campaign by targeting Red Sea shipping as well as Israel itself with drones and missiles. Both the United Kingdom and the United States have responded to the attacks on shipping by carrying out strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen. Over the weekend,\u00a0Israel struck inside Yemen for the first time following a deadly drone attack launched by Houthi rebels on Tel Aviv.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/22/middleeast/us-navy-first-air-to-air-kill-female-fighter-pilot-intl-hnk-ml/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_22_europe_paul-watson-whaling-activist-arrested-greenland-japan-intl-hnk", "text": "Veteran environmentalist Paul Watson was arrested in Greenland on Sunday and faces possible extradition to Japan allegedly over anti-whaling activities in the Antarctic years ago, his organization said in a statement. The 73-year-old Canadian-American dual national was detained by police when his ship docked in the Greenland capital Nuuk to refuel, according to the Captain Paul Watson Foundation (CPWF) and Greenland police. The ship John Paul DeJoria and a 25-member crew were en route from Dublin, Ireland to the North Pacific to intercept Japan\u2019s newly launched $48 million factory whaling ship the Kangei Maru, CPWF said. \u201cWe were immediately boarded by a SWAT team and \u2026 police who wasted no time in cuffing Paul Watson, our founder, and arresting him on a decades old Red Notice at the request of Japan,\u201d Ship Operations Director\u00a0Locky MacLean said in a video message onboard the John Paul DeJoria. Police can be seen boarding the vessel and leading Watson away in handcuffs in the video. In a statement, Greenland police said they arrested Watson upon his arrival in Nuuk due to a Japanese arrest warrant. He will be brought before a district court with a request to detain him while a decision is made on his possible extradition to Japan, police added. His foundation believes the arrest \u201cis connected to a previous Red Notice issued for Watson\u2019s anti-whaling activities in the Antarctic.\u201d \u201cThis development comes as a surprise since the Foundation\u2019s lawyers had reported that the Red Notice had been withdrawn. However, it appears that Japan had made the notice confidential to facilitate Paul\u2019s travel for the purpose of making an arrest,\u201d the statement continued. CPWF said it \u201cbelieves the reactivation of the Red Notice against Captain Watson is politically motivated, coinciding with the launch of the new factory ship.\u201d The Japan Coast Guard (JCG) told CNN it was aware that Greenland police have issued a statement about Watson and said, \u201cWe will continue to respond appropriately in coordination and cooperation with related organizations.\u201d Interpol issued a Red Notice for Watson in September 2012, two years after the JCG issued an arrest warrant for him.\u00a0CNN has contacted Interpol for more information. An early member of Greenpeace, Watson went on to found the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, an environmental group famous for\u00a0tracking,\u00a0exposing\u00a0and\u00a0occasionally ramming\u00a0Japanese whalers. His attempts to disrupt Japanese whalers at sea gained him fame through Animal Planet\u2019s \u201cWhale Wars\u201d TV show. His activities have also previously landed him in legal trouble. In 2012, he was detained in Germany on an international arrest warrant issued by Costa Rica, which accused him of endangering a fishing vessel off the coast of Guatemala in 2002. He skipped bail but denied wrongdoing in that case. In 2013, the Japan\u2019s Institute of Cetacean Research and the Japanese firm Kyodo Senpaku Kaisha secured a US District Court injunction against Watson and Sea Shepherd, which prohibited him and his group from coming within 500 yards of the plaintiffs on the open sea. Due to the injunction, Watson resigned as president and executive director of the conservation society in the United States and as president of the society in Australia. In June, Kyodo Senpaku launched a brand-new whaling \u201cmothership\u201d \u2013 the Kangei Maru \u2013 a 370-foot, 9,300-ton vessel equipped with state-of-the-art drones able to travel a reported 100 kilometers (62 miles) to allow crews to quickly locate and kill whales. The new ship replaces the\u00a0Nisshin Maru, the infamous whaling factory vessel dubbed by activists as a \u201cfloating slaughterhouse\u201d that was decommissioned in 2020 after more than 30 years of service, during which it frequently\u00a0clashed\u00a0with anti-whaling activists. Watson told CNN ahead of the launch that he believes the ship\u2019s high-powered features \u2013 including a cruising range of 13,000 kilometers (more than 8,000 miles) and its ability to sail for up to 60 days \u2013 suggests that Japan could set its sights on whales far beyond its northern waters. \u201cJapan has never given up on its whaling ambitions,\u201d Watson told CNN at the time. \u201cThe only purpose of a vessel like that is so it can travel long distances \u2026 to hunt whales.\u201d Japan is one of three countries, along with\u00a0Norway\u00a0and Iceland, that continues to hunt whales, and officials argue that the industry is an important part of its culture and history \u2013 and also provides food security. The Kangei Maru boasts a slipway large enough to haul 85-foot whales from the sea that leads to an indoor flensing deck the size of two basketball courts. There, workers will strip away the blubber before cutting up the whale flesh on enormous cutting boards, before vacuum-packing and storing the meat in 40 industrial freezers, ready for sale. Takaaki Sakamoto, director of the Whaling Affairs Office in Japan\u2019s Fisheries Agency, told CNN that Japan sent ships to the Antarctic last year to collect numbers and skin surface samples, but those expeditions did not involve killing whales. He said they planned to return this year to do the same. Hideki Tokoro, president of Kyodo Senpaku,\u00a0told CNN the Kangei Maru is not planning on killing whales beyond Japanese waters because it doesn\u2019t make economic sense. Commercial whaling was banned under a 1986 International Whaling Commission moratorium. But Japan has used a loophole to continue hunting whales legally for what it claims is scientific research. In 2018, it announced its withdrawal from the IWC and resumed commercial whaling months later in defiance of international criticism. \u201cWe are proud of catching whales and are very proud of this ship which will allow us to begin offshore mothership-style whaling this year,\u201d Tokoro told reporters in June.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/22/europe/paul-watson-whaling-activist-arrested-greenland-japan-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "style_almudena-romero-photos-onto-plants-spc", "text": " Spanish artist Almudena Romero knew from a young age that she loved plants: \u201cI must have been about four or five - my granny would call and say, \u2018what do you want for your birthday?\u2019 And I\u2019d be like, an olive\u00a0tree.\u201d Now, with her inclusion in exhibitions in London (at the Saatchi Gallery) and Paris (Albert Khan Museum), she\u2019s showcasing her unique plant-based art that\u2019s pushing audiences to question their hyper-consumerism whilst showing that it\u2019s possible to create art in an eco-friendly manner. In her four-chapter series called \u201cThe Pigment Change,\u201d rather than developing photos on photographic paper, she prints them directly onto plants. \u201cI just put a negative on top of the leaf and leave it to the sunlight, and then the image gets recorded on the leaf,\u201d Romero said. \u201cBut I also print on living plants using a digital projector, and the plant makes photosynthesis with the light from the projector and records an image.\u201d In a chapter from that series, called \u201cFamily Album,\u201d she spreads watercress seeds on a stretched canvas, and lets them grow in the dark, before projecting a negative onto the watercress. \u201cThe parts that receive more light produce chlorophyll, hence the dark green tones, and the parts that receive less light remain yellow, pale,\u201d she said. \u201c[It\u2019s] exactly like in a photographic darkroom. But instead of having an enlarger, I have a projector, and my watercress canvas is my photo paper. That\u2019s how I grow photographs.\u201d The chlorophyll process adopted by Almudena\u00a0was popularized in the 90\u2019s by Heather Ackroyd and Dan Harvey, who projected photographs onto grass using\u00a0a negative and light cast by a projector bulb. Allegedly, the British artists came up with the technique when they noticed random outlines of a ladder cast onto one of their grass installations. Despite being an innovative process, it wasn\u2019t simple. It required a lot of space and preparation. Later, Artist Binh Danh enhanced this method by using photosensitive materials from plants, securing a positive straight into a leaf and\u00a0enabling sunlight to bleach the photo onto its surface. Learning from Plants Romero, who was raised in Madrid, used to spend holidays on her grandparents\u2019 avocado farm in Valencia, in eastern Spain. Breathing fresh air, picking fruit, and learning from her grandmother about plants during her formative years instilled in her the eco-conscious values she embraces today. \u201cWhen you grow close to nature, it becomes a really important thing in your life,\u201d she said. \u201cPlants for me are important, partly because of the legacy of my family and because as a photographic material, it\u2019s impressive in quality.\u201d But she concedes that her eco-friendly techniques wouldn\u2019t work for all artists. \u201cIt is a niche because it produces ephemeral pieces, so it\u2019s a lot more difficult to be financially sustainable when your art is ephemeral, but I guess it\u2019s also depending on how you understand life and what you want to do with your practice,\u201d she explained.\u00a0 The 38-year-old is not alone in her love for plants. According to a survey published by consumer analytics platform CivicScience, more than 200 million Americans were houseplant owners in 2020. In the past few years, Millennials have embraced the \u201cplant-parent\u201d craze, sharing photos and care tips on social media. But for Romero, plants are much more than something to look after: they\u2019re beings we can learn from. \u201cPlants have been [around] for way longer than us on the planet and they have succeeded in doing that without causing any extinction,\u201d she said. Romero points to plants in deserts and arid environments that have evolved strategies that limit reproduction, saying they allow her to better argue that it\u2019s not an \u201cunnatural behavior\u201d to choose to be child-free. \u201cI am a person who doesn\u2019t want to have children because of climate change,\u201d she explained. \u201cI simply don\u2019t feel comfortable.\u201d In her series \u201cThe Pigment Change\u201d she questions whether maternity or parenthood is something \u201cbeyond one\u2019s control\u201d or a \u201cquestion of will,\u201d reflecting on plants\u2019 selective reproduction strategies and opening a broader reflection on procreation. In 2020, she won the BMW Residency Award for the project and her work was exhibited at the renowned photography festival Rencontres d\u2019Arles, in France. It\u2019s not only about what we can learn from plants, though. For the Spaniard, we should also consider non-anthropocentric ethics (a philosophical perspective which challenges the idea that humans are the most important beings, emphasizing the value of all living organisms and ecosystems), seeing other species as having their own agendas and intentionality. The artist explained that she sees photoperiodism (the way plants respond and adapt to light changes throughout the seasons) as a performance by plants. \u201cWhy do we tend to think that we only have these capacities as humans?\u201d said Romero. \u201cThe problem is the perspective that we have that we think that we are very different until science proves the opposite.\u201d Studies have shown that plants can be more complex than we may think. According to an article published in The Plant Journal, plants like Arabidopsis feel stressed when touched, which stunts their growth, while in 2019, another research group found that beach evening-primrose respond to the sound of pollinators. Now,\u00a0Romero is\u00a0working on her next project, which is due to be completed by June 2025. Commissioned by France\u2019s National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and Environment, the size of the work is planned to be bigger than a stadium. \u201cI\u2019m working in farming what will be the largest photographic artwork ever produced. We are going to farm an image of 30,000 square meters,\u201d she said. Romero is collaborating with scientist Nicolas Langlade, with the help of AI, to use genetically different wheats and grasses to achieve a color palette sufficiently rich to produce a distinguishable image. The artwork reflects on the human relationship with land and plants, our impact on the environment and our interdependency with nature. For Romero, this art-science project is like coming full circle. \u201cIt\u2019s a combination of my family\u2019s background because we are going to farm it,\u201d she said. \u201cI love my passion for plant photography, so I\u2019m really happy about it.\u201d \u201cMetamorphosis\u201d is showing at the Saatchi Gallery, London, until the 28 July. \u201cNatures Vivantes\u201d is showing at the Albert Khan Museum, Paris, until the 31 December.", "source": "http://cnn.com/style/almudena-romero-photos-onto-plants-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "travel_japan-overtourism-nara-deer-intl-hnk", "text": "While Japan\u2019s overtourism issues may be causing headaches for local residents, there\u2019s one group that seems to be benefiting from the influx of people \u2013 deer. Specifically, the deer who live in Nara, the ancient capital outside of Kyoto that is home to a series of UNESCO-recognized historic buildings. Nara and its deer are so closely associated that the light-brown colored animals are pictured in the city\u2019s tourism ads, on buses, train tickets and more. Shops are packed full of deer-themed souvenirs like stuffed animals and antler headbands. The city recently carried out a deer census, determining there are 313 stags (males), 798 does (females) and 214 fawns (babies) in Nara Park. That\u2019s an increase of 92 from last year, and a total of 1,325 deer. But what does this have to do with tourism? Despite Nara being home to attractions like Todaiji Temple, one of the world\u2019s largest wooden structures, the majority of tourists come to meet the deer, who are known for bowing politely when given a cracker. Stalls around Nara sell these special rice bran \u201cShika Senbei\u201d treats, which are safe for the deer to eat. Nobuyuki Yamazaki of the Nara Deer Preservation Foundation told CNN that \u201ca constant increase in the number of deer crackers eaten has resulted in more active reproduction of the deer. There are also more tourists visiting the park, and the deer can get the crackers more easily.\u201d However, not all of the human-deer interactions are positive ones. Some deer have become too accustomed to having people around and too eager to snatch a cracker out of a tourist\u2019s hand. \u201cAs the number of deer and humans increase, so does the number of problems,\u201d Yamazaki added. \u201cIn recent years, we\u2019ve seen an increase in accidents with people being pushed over or bitten by a deer.\u201d A study from the Nara Women\u2019s University found that fewer deer were bowing during the pandemic, when the country was closed to international tourists. Bowing in deer is unique to Nara and has not been found in any other deer species. \u201cA long time ago, the deer in the capital Nara were afraid of humans, so they might have started bowing as a result of being stressed. However, the city gradually became a sightseeing spot and the deer learned to bow to people to get Shika Senbei rice crackers,\u201d said professor Yoichi Yusa, who headed the study. According to government data, 9.3 million people visited Nara in 2022. Japan has been coping with a significant influx of tourists since it reopened post-pandemic. March, April and May of this year each saw more than three million foreign tourists per month coming to Japan, breaking all-time tourism records. Some destinations, following similar measures implemented in Europe, have begun charging tourist fees. Beginning July 1, Mount Fuji implemented a daily visitor cap of 4,000 hikers. Visitors must pay 2,000 yen ($12.40) per person. Meanwhile, the popular Itsukushima Shrine near Hiroshima, which was visited by US President Joe Biden in 2023, recently began charging an entry fee for the first time in its thousand-year history.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/japan-overtourism-nara-deer-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_07_16_europe_macron-france-attal-resignation-intl", "text": "French President Emmanuel Macron has accepted the resignation of Prime Minister Gabriel Attal and his government, but asked him to remain in post to act as a caretaker until a new cabinet is appointed. Attal offered to step down last week after Macron\u2019s centrist Ensemble alliance was defeated in the second round of France\u2019s snap parliamentary election, but the president refused, asking him to stay on for a short period to maintain stability. Eight days later, Macron accepted Attal\u2019s resignation after a meeting at the Elysee in Paris, but once again asked him to remain in post until a new government forms, meaning France remains in political limbo, with no clear successor in sight. \u201cIn order for this period to end as quickly as possible, it is up to Republican forces to work together to build unity around projects and actions in the service of the French people,\u201d the Elysee said in a statement. The French constitution states that the president appoints a new prime minister, but it does not detail how nor the timeframe within which they must do so. Until a new government is appointed, a caretaker government sits in place, able to respond to emergencies but not empowered to enact any legislative reforms. Separately, French lawmakers will meet Thursday to elect the president of the National Assembly, in two votes requiring a majority of the 577-seat body.\u00a0If the first two votes don\u2019t elect someone, the candidate with the largest support in parliament will be selected in a third vote. Following their resignation, Attal and his fellow ministers who are lawmakers will be allowed to vote in the election of the National Assembly president, potentially providing key ballots in the divided body. The assembly president holds a position comparable to the speaker of the House of Representatives, organizing the legislative agenda and steering the appointment of key commission posts. No obvious successor While Attal\u2019s resignation paves the way for Macron to appoint a successor, there is no obvious candidate to replace him. The newly elected National Assembly looks set to be gridlocked after the second round of voting delivered a hung parliament. Although the election was inconclusive, it was heralded as a victory for the French mainstream and a measure of voters\u2019 overwhelming desire to keep the far right from gaining power. Marine Le Pen\u2019s National Rally (RN) party had taken a commanding lead in the first round, stirring fears that France could be on the cusp of electing its first far-right government since the collaborationist Vichy regime of World War II. But, after a week of political bargaining that saw more than 200 centrist and left-wing candidates withdraw to avoid splitting the vote, the RN slumped to third place in the second round. In a shock result, the left-wing New Popular Front (NFP) alliance won the most seats of any bloc. It is customary for the French president to appoint a prime minister from the largest group in parliament. But it is still not clear from which party within the NFP this will be. The hastily assembled alliance, which formed just days after Macron called the election last month, comprises several parties straddling vast ideological ground, from the hard-left France Unbowed party to the more moderate Socialist Party and Place Publique. But, more than a week after the vote, the alliance has still not put forward a prime ministerial candidate, in a potential sign of the divisions within the capacious \u2013 and potentially fractious \u2013 coalition France Unbowed won the most seats of any party within the NFP, and so might have been expected to be called on to put forward a candidate to succeed Attal. But Macron\u2019s allies have repeatedly said they will not work with its leader, the populist firebrand Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, saying his party is just as extreme \u2013 and therefore unfit to govern \u2013 as the RN. Even if Macron does appoint a prime minister from the NFP, the party will still need to enter into yet another coalition \u2013 likely with Ensemble \u2013 in order to pass laws. Another option is a \u201ctechnocratic\u201d government. Macron is not constitutionally obliged to appoint a prime minister from the largest bloc, and so could call on a candidate outside of mainstream politics to manage day-to-day matters. Italy took this option when it appointed Mario Draghi, the former head of the European Central Bank, to run its government.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/europe/macron-france-attal-resignation-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_22_world_world-reaction-biden-exit-2024-us-presidential-race", "text": "Messages of gratitude and support for US President Joe Biden poured in following his stunning announcement Sunday that he is exiting the 2024 presidential race and endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris as the next Democratic nominee. It was the second seismic moment in US politics in just over a week, following the assassination attempt against former president Donald Trump at a Pennsylvania rally on July 13, which saw global leaders rally around him as the Republican nominee. Pressure had mounted on Biden to pull out of the race since his disastrous performance at the CNN presidential debate last month, and on Sunday, he confirmed he would remain a one-term president, prompting a flood of tributes from US allies who thanked him for his leadership. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who met with Biden this month in Washington, said he respects the president\u2019s decision and looks forward to working together for the remainder of his term. \u201cI know that, as he has done throughout his remarkable career, he will have made his decision based on what he believes is best for the American people,\u201d Starmer wrote on X. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau thanked Biden for being a \u201ctrue friend\u201d to his country. \u201cHe\u2019s a great man, and everything he does is guided by his love for his country,\u201d he said on X. In a news conference, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Biden deserves to be recognized for \u201conce again not putting himself forward first, but giving his first consideration to being what he believes is in the interests of the United States of America, as he has done his whole public life.\u201d \u201cPresident Biden has dedicated his life to public service, and that is something that deserves much respect,\u201d New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said on X. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky thanked Biden for his \u201cunwavering support\u201d in his country\u2019s war against Russia, which the US has backed with weapons, military aid and diplomatic support, despite backlash from Republicans. \u201cMany strong decisions have been made in recent years and they will be remembered as bold steps taken by President Biden in response to challenging times,\u201d Zelensky said on X. \u201cWe will always be thankful for President Biden\u2019s leadership.\u201d Meanwhile, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow was \u201cnot too surprised\u201d by Biden\u2019s withdrawal. \u201cIn recent years, what has been happening in the United States has taught us not to be surprised by anything,\u201d Peskov told reporters Monday. \u201cThis topic should concern American voters, but not us,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cwhat is very important for us is the future of Russian-American relations, which are now experiencing the worst period in history.\u201d Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that, whoever wins the US presidential election, Israel will remain \u201can irreplaceable ally\u201d for Washington in the Middle East. Speaking on Monday from the tarmac of Tel Aviv\u2019s Ben Gurion Airport ahead of boarding a flight to the US, Netanyahu said his trip was an opportunity to thank Biden \u201cfor the things he did for the state of Israel, both in the war and during his years of service as a senator, as vice president and as president.\u201d President Isaac Herzog described Biden as a \u201ctrue ally of the Jewish people,\u201d while Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said the US president\u2019s \u201csteadfast backing, especially during the war, has been invaluable,\u201d both in posts to X. Biden has been one of the biggest supporters of Israel\u2019s war in Gaza since Hamas\u2019 October 7 attacks. But he has increasingly clashed with Netanyahu over humanitarian aid and the mounting civilian death toll of the conflict. Irish\u00a0Taoiseach\u00a0Simon Harris called Biden \u201ca proud American with an Irish soul,\u201d and thanked him for his \u201cglobal leadership\u201d and \u201cfriendship.\u201d Outgoing Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said Monday that Biden was a \u201cgood leader\u201d who\u2019d had \u201cvery good results\u201d with the pandemic and the \u201ceconomic crisis\u201d caused by the Russia-Ukraine war. Other leaders commended Biden for making what must have been a tough decision to drop out of the race. French President Emmanuel Macron in a letter to Biden praised the American leader\u2019s decision to end his reelection bid , saying that it showed \u201ccourage\u201d and \u201csense of duty,\u201d the Elysee Palace press office said on Monday. \u201cI appreciate the courage, the spirit of responsibility and the sense of duty that led you to this decision,\u201d Macron wrote. \u201cMy friend Joe Biden has achieved a lot: for his country, for Europe, for the world,\u201d German chancellor Olaf Scholz wrote on X. \u201cHis decision not to run again deserves respect.\u201d Speaking at a rally Sunday, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro said Biden made the \u201ccorrect\u201d decision and put his family and health first. He wished him \u201chealth and a long life.\u201d Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk wrote on X that Biden had made difficult decisions \u201cthanks to which Poland, America and the world are safer, and democracy stronger.\u201d \u201cI know you were driven by the same motivations when announcing your final decision. Probably the most difficult one,\u201d Tusk said. Leaders in South Korea and Japan said they would not comment about domestic politics in the US but emphasized the need to continue to work with the White House. Both nations have a mutual defense treaty with the United States and Biden was a major promoter of deepening ties between allies in Asia, in part to counter the growing assertiveness of China. \u201cI recognize that President Biden\u2019s decision is based on his desire to make the best possible political decision,\u201d said Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. \u201cThe Japan-US alliance is the cornerstone of our nation\u2019s diplomatic security, and we will continue to monitor it closely.\u201d The office of South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said it will \u201ccontinue to work closely with the US to further develop the South Korea-US global comprehensive strategic alliance.\u201d Philippine President Ferdinand \u201cBongbong\u201d Marcos JR said Biden\u2019s \u201cdecision to withdraw from his candidacy is a demonstration of genuine statesmanship.\u201d \u201cWe thank him for his constant and unwavering support for the Philippines in a delicate and difficult time,\u201d he wrote on X. The Philippines, which is also a treaty ally of the US, has found itself increasingly confronting Chinese vessels in the South China Sea in recent years. There was no official word from Chinese leader Xi Jinping as of Monday morning local time. But \u201cBiden dropping out of the election\u201d was the top trending topic early Monday on Weibo, China\u2019s X-like social platform, with five more related topics including discussions of Kamala Harris and Trump\u2019s assassination attempt together accumulating more than 400 million views. Some Chinese social media users excitedly speculated about the prospect of a woman becoming US president, while others said they believe Trump will win no matter the Democratic candidate. \u201cThe shot was definitely a good deal for Trump!\u201d one Weibo user wrote. One user remarked, \u201cthat one shot didn\u2019t kill Trump but dropped Biden,\u201d while another described the political situation in the US as \u201ca total mess.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/22/world/world-reaction-biden-exit-2024-us-presidential-race/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "world"}}

The vessel left Haiti on Wednesday carrying over 80 migrants, and was headed to Turks and Caicos, the IOM said. Forty-one survivors were rescued by Haiti\u2019s Coast Guard, it also said. In a statement, Gr\u00e9goire Goodstein, IOM\u2019s chief of mission in the country, blamed the tragedy on Haiti\u2019s spiraling security crisis and the lack of \u201csafe and legal pathways for migration.\u201d \u201cHaiti\u2019s socio-economic situation is in agony. The extreme violence over the past months has only brought Haitians to resort to desperate measures even more,\u201d he said. Haiti is\u00a0grappling with gang violence, a collapsing health system, and a lack of access to essential supplies, leading many Haitians to embark on dangerous journeys out of the country. The Caribbean nation\u2019s crisis escalated earlier this year when gang warfare exploded, forcing the resignation of the then-government.

{"id": "2024_07_16_europe_orban-trump-eu-ukraine-letter-intl", "text": "Hungary\u2019s Prime Minister Viktor\u00a0Orban\u00a0has told European leaders that Donald Trump is \u201cready to act as a peace broker\u201d between Russia and Ukraine if elected president, amid concerns across the continent that Trump would attempt to force Kyiv into ceding territory to Moscow. Orban\u2019s letter, addressed to European Council President Charles Michel and sent to all European Union leaders, was written in the wake of\u00a0his controversial meetings with former President Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping. \u201cI can [\u2026] surely state that shortly after his election victory, he will not wait until his inauguration, [Trump] will be ready to act as a peace broker immediately. He has detailed and well-founded plans for this,\u201d\u00a0Orban wrote. The authoritarian Hungarian premier has sought to cast himself as a peacemaker in the conflict, but his stance is at odds with most EU leaders, who have pledged unequivocal support for Ukraine as it attempts to repel Russia\u2019s military effort. In his letter to those leaders,\u00a0Orban\u00a0said that during the meetings there was a \u201cgeneral observation\u201d that \u201cthe intensity of the military conflict\u201d in Ukraine \u201cwill radically escalate in the near future.\u201d Orban\u00a0also hinted at Trump\u2019s plans to potentially pare back aid to Ukraine if elected, saying: \u201cI am more than convinced that in the likely outcome of the victory of President Trump, the proportion of the financial burden between the US and the EU will significantly change to the EU\u2019s disadvantage when it comes to the financial support of Ukraine.\u201d Trump, who has a propensity to make sweeping pronouncements on foreign policy, said during a CNN town hall last year that, \u201cIf I\u2019m president, I will have that war settled in one day, 24 hours.\u201d In last month\u2019s CNN debate with President Joe Biden, Trump said that Putin\u2019s terms for an agreement \u2013 which would include Ukraine ceding the four territories currently occupied by Russia \u2013 are \u201cnot acceptable.\u201d But the former president, who is set to formally accept the Republican nomination at the party\u2019s national convention later this week, has also criticized US military aid to Kyiv. Orban \u2013 a rare, longtime ally of Trump in the EU \u2013 has undertaken what he has previously called his \u201cpeace missions,\u201d\u00a0meeting Putin\u00a0in Moscow on July 5 and\u00a0Xi in Beijing\u00a0on July 8. Last Thursday he met with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida. He also visited\u00a0Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv at the start of July, marking his first visit to Ukraine since the Russian invasion began. Orban called on EU leaders to try to find a \u201cwindow of opportunity\u201d to usher in a \u201cnew chapter\u201d in EU policy in his letter, urging them to \u201cmake an effort to decrease tensions and/or create the conditions for a temporary ceasefire and/or start peace negotiations\u201d in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Hungary took over the rotating EU presidency last month, unveiling a slogan \u2013 \u201cMake Europe Great Again\u201d \u2013 that mimicked Trump\u2019s 2016 election motto. But his visits with Putin, Xi and Trump have gone down poorly with EU lawmakers, who have accused\u00a0Orban\u00a0of vitally \u201cmisrepresenting\u201d and \u201cundermining\u201d the EU\u2019s stance on foreign policy.  In a letter to Orban Tuesday, European Council President Charles Michel hit back against many of the points made by the Hungarian prime minister. \u201cThe most direct way to peace is for Russia to withdraw all of its forces from Ukraine and respect Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity and the UN Charter,\u201d Michel wrote in the letter, a copy of which was obtained by CNN. Michel wrote that \u201cno discussion about Ukraine can take place without Ukraine\u201d and rejected Orban\u2019s claim that the EU has led a \u201cpro-war policy,\u201d saying that \u201cit is quite the opposite.\u201d \u201cRussia is the aggressor and Ukraine is the victim exercising its legitimate right to self-defense. Russia is leading a war of aggression in blatant violation of international law, Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity and sovereignty in accordance with the UN Charter,\u201d Michel wrote. Michel noted \u201cthe EU\u2019s position on Ukraine is agreed by consensus by the European Council, and was confirmed most recently in June.\u201d The European Council president also told Orban that Hungary, which holds the rotating presidency of the council until the end of the year, \u201chas no role in representing the (European Union) on the international stage and received no European Council mandate to engage on behalf of the union.\u201d \u201cI made this clear even prior to your visit to Moscow and this was subsequently reiterated by High Representative Borrell in his statement of July 5,\u201d Michel wrote. Michel said in his letter that he would share it with the other members of the European Council, and would \u201calso inform Ukraine of this exchange.\u201d A separate\u00a0letter signed by 63 European lawmakers, addressed to the three EU chiefs, said\u00a0Orban\u00a0had \u201ccaused significant damage\u201d through his meetings. \u201cIn his so-called peace mission, Prime Minister\u00a0Orban\u00a0deliberately left the impression that he was acting on behalf of the entire European Union, whereas in reality he has no authority to represent the EU or any other member state other than his own,\u201d the Members of European Parliament said. The lawmakers called the meetings particularly damaging considering that Hungary currently holds the presidency of the European Council, saying\u00a0Orban\u00a0was guilty of \u201cabusing\u201d the position that he assumed at the beginning of July. EU lawmakers finished their letter by calling on the bloc\u2019s three leaders, Michel, Ursula von der Leyen and Roberta Metsola, to suspend Hungary\u2019s voting rights in the European Council, arguing that past examples had shown that \u201cmere verbal condemnation\u201d of Hungary has \u201cno effect.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/europe/orban-trump-eu-ukraine-letter-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_23_travel_passenger-compensation-delta-air-lines-outage", "text": "Delta Air Lines faced its fifth day of operational disruptions on Tuesday stemming from a global tech outage. While most airlines affected by a CrowdStrike software update that crashed Windows systems had largely resumed normal operations by the end of the weekend, Delta was still struggling with the crew tracking system needed to staff its flights. Thousands of bags were separated from passengers who couldn\u2019t make the same journeys upon which their luggage embarked. And some weary, frustrated passengers were still trying to reconstruct travel plans or abandon them for compensation. Passengers over the weekend reported wait times of six hours or more on customer service phone lines before they gave up without reaching agents. The Department of Transportation has opened an investigation into Delta\u2019s service meltdown. Delta said it is cooperating with the DOT and remains \u201centirely focused on restoring our operation.\u201d \u201cAcross our operation,\u00a0Delta\u00a0teams are working tirelessly to care for and make it right for customers impacted by delays and cancellations as we work to restore the reliable, on-time service they have come to expect from\u00a0Delta,\u201d the airline said in a statement. Here\u2019s what we know about what they\u2019re entitled to and how passengers can make claims with the airline. What are Delta passengers entitled to? A refund The Department of Transportation has been adamant that airlines offer money-back refunds to passengers affected by cancellations or \u201csignificant\u201d delays, rather than e-credits for future travel. Travelers may choose e-credits, but portions of their trips not flown are refundable. Delta lists a \u201cright to a refund upon request\u201d in a Monday afternoon update on what it\u2019s doing to serve affected customers. Delta refunds can be requested here. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg hammered the refund requirement on X over the weekend. \u201cI am hearing reports of some airlines only offering flight credits to passengers for cancelled flights.\u00a0Let me be clear \u2013 you are entitled to get your money back promptly if your flight is cancelled and you don\u2019t take a rebooking,\u201d Buttigieg posted Saturday. While there was some question in the early hours of the outage on Friday whether the situation was within the airlines\u2019 control, the DOT soon put that question to rest for US carriers, deeming the fallout from the system outage \u201ccontrollable.\u201d \u201cA \u2018controllable\u2019 flight cancellation or delay is one that is attributable to the airline,\u201d the DOT said in a statement Friday, which put commitments airlines have made to their customers in such events applicable. Those are detailed on this DOT dashboard. Coverage of eligible expenses Delta outlined that it is responsible for covering expenses \u201cresulting from this flight  disruption, including providing meal vouchers, hotel accommodations where available and ground transportation.\u201d Lines stretched down concourses on Saturday evening at Delta\u2019s hometown airport, Atlanta\u2019s Hartsfield-Jackson International. Some passengers reported six-hour waits, and many affected passengers had trouble securing food and lodging over the weekend. Buttigieg addressed mounting complaints from passengers on Sunday: \u201cDelta must provide prompt refunds to consumers who choose not to take rebooking, free rebooking for those who do, and timely reimbursements for food and hotel stays to consumers affected by these delays and cancellations, as well as adequate customer service assistance,\u201d he posted on X. Reimbursement of eligible expenses Travelers who made their own arrangements during the disruption can be reimbursed. \u201cCustomers who have incurred hotel, meal or ground transportation expenses while in transit during this operational disruption may submit eligible expenses for reimbursement,\u201d Delta said in an outline of what travelers can expect.\u00a0(Among the expenses that are not eligible for reimbursement: hotel reservations at the traveler\u2019s destination, vacation experiences, lost wages, tickets to concerts or other events). Impacted passengers can submit reimbursement requests here. Additional compensation The airline has also said it would issue Delta SkyMiles or a travel voucher \u201cin an amount based on the customer\u2019s affected travels.\u201d How can passengers file complaints? Complaints can be filed online with Delta. Online complaints generate a case number that can be used to track them. An auto-response to one passenger complaint filed on Monday said most inquiries receive a response \u201cwithin 7 days,\u201d adding \u201chowever, due to the complexity of certain situations, additional time may be required to respond.\u201d The Department of Transportation also fields air travel service complaints. \u201cWhile you should first try to resolve issues directly with the airline, we want to hear from passengers who believe that Delta has not complied with USDOT-enforced passenger protection requirements during the recent travel disruptions. We will follow up,\u201d Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg posted Tuesday on X. The DOT says on its website that contacting airlines directly may result in the fastest resolution of many service complaints, but the agency does require airlines to acknowledge consumer complaints filed with the DOT. \u00a0The agency also collects complaints in a database to help it spot trends in the industry that may inform future rulemaking. How can passengers retrieve luggage? The operational meltdown has separated thousands of passengers from their luggage, which in many cases made it to destinations the passengers could not reach. Claims for delayed, lost or damaged luggage can be submitted online. However, the form requires a file reference number that can only be obtained through a Delta agent. \u201cYour file reference number is 8 or 10-digit alphanumeric code located on the front of baggage information folder given to you by the Delta agent with whom you first reported your baggage delay,\u201d Delta\u2019s online form says. In Atlanta on Monday morning, passengers waited in two-hour plus lines to speak with Delta agents at the Baggage Service Office to get those reference numbers and file claims. Claims can be filed at any Baggage Service Office. Customers can also call 1-800-325-8224 to make a baggage claim. \u201cWe have set up an internal Baggage Command Center in Atlanta, where we are seeing the highest number of displaced baggage, in an effort to expedite the process of reuniting customers with their belongings,\u201d Delta said on Tuesday. Delta has extended its travel waiver for travel through July 23. Details are available here.

A rare flash flood emergency was issued for around 5,000 people in Yellville and surrounding areas of Marion County after 6 to 11 inches of rain fell in just four to five hours, according to the National Weather Service. The area typically receives just 3.5 to 4 inches of rain in the entire month of July. The extreme rainfall rate would be expected once in 500 years, the kind of intense rainfall becoming more common as the world warms due to fossil fuel pollution. Only around 40 flash flood emergencies are issued on average each year, but Wednesday\u2019s was the 48th this year. It has since expired. At least 30 homes and a nursing facility in the county were evacuated as the dangerous floodwaters hit the area, Melissa Penn, Marion County Emergency Management Director, told CNN. Approximately 80 patients from the nursing home were transported to a temporary facility. At least one bridge in Marion County was washed out by flooding, according to the county\u2019s social media. Other roads were inundated, and all government offices were closed Wednesday. People were urged by officials not to venture out onto roads that were \u201cflooded and not safe\u201d in Flippin, also in Marion County. \u201cWe are experiencing some major flooding in our area. Emergency personnel are out and working diligently. Please use extreme caution if you feel the need to travel,\u201d Flippin Police Chief John Spence\u00a0wrote on social media Wednesday morning. At least one water rescue occurred just outside of Flippin city limits, according to Penn. Heavy rain pounded northern Arkansas and southern Missouri through much of the morning. Seven inches of rain fell in less than six hours in Branson, Missouri, where roughly 14,000 people live, a once-in-1,000 year rainfall rate. Turkey Creek at Hollister, Missouri, just south of Branson, rose 12 feet in two hours Wednesday morning. Only light rain remained by the afternoon. Lingering showers will come to an end by the evening and the area will remain dry into at least Saturday. CNN\u2019s Sara Tonks, Brandon Miller and Rebekah Riess contributed to this report.

{"id": "2024_07_22_style_bond-tower-tirana-albania", "text": "In Albania\u2019s capital Tirana, where a spate of new towers will soon\u00a0transform the skyline, architects have revealed plans for a new\u00a0double skyscraper that will bend elegantly like a ballet dancer\u2019s pli\u00e9, or a lover leaning in for a kiss. These were two of the visual cues for Bond Tower, a 50-story residential building and hotel that seems to trick the eye. Designed by Portuguese architecture firm OODA, the skyscraper will feature two connected structures that gently separate before rejoining one other, giving it a warped effect. Residents will stay on one side and hotel guests on the other, with office space and retail mixed in on several of the floors. The rolling mountains surrounding the city will be visible in the negative space between the buildings, explained Diogo Brito, a partner at OODA. Located on the corner of a major avenue, the silhouette of Bond Tower shifts depending on which direction it\u2019s approached from, he added. \u201cWe found this idea of having this dance between these two volumes\u2026 like a gentle encounter on the corner,\u201d Brito said in a phone interview. \u201cIt is very important to us to have this equilibrium \u2014 this balanced the beauty of form and shape.\u201d The architectural team designed the shape using multiple visual references, including the \u201cgrace\u201d of a ballet dancer\u2019s movement and the romantic gesture of Gustav Klimt\u2019s famous 1908 painting \u201cThe Kiss.\u201d But OODA also wanted to integrate Tirana\u2019s natural landscape into the design, which Brito said is sustainability-minded thanks to its carbon-absorbing stone cladding. \u201cThe thing that strikes you the most when you land in Tirana is the presence of those mountains, and to have\u00a0(them visible) through that gap is something that was also interesting for us to picture,\u201d he added. Aside from its visual appeal, the the unusual shape also offers structural sturdiness in an area prone to earthquakes, Brito explained. The project will break ground by the end of the year, according to the architect, with the tower scheduled for completion by the end of 2028. It will be one of many new buildings sending the Albanian capital\u2019s skyline soaring and turning the city into an architectural destination. Earlier this month, Albania\u2019s National Territorial Council approved a new tower that would become the city\u2019s tallest building, according to local news reports. Several other high-rises are already under construction in the capital, including two 58-floor skyscrapers: Mount Tirana by Denmark\u2019s CEBRA architecture and Tirana Tour by Spain\u2019s Bofill Arquitectura. And, in January, Architectural Digest magazine\u00a0recognized one of the city\u2019s newest jewels \u2014 a monumental, colorful pyramid by Dutch studio MVRDV, revamped from a dilapidated former museum \u2014 as one of the world\u2019s best new architectural projects. OODA alone is working on three other projects in the city, including a new television station headquarters inspired by a stack of film reels. This month, OODA will break ground on a greenery filled residential tower called Hora Vertikale that was designed as a \u201cvertical village,\u201d according to the firm. On the avenue where Bond Tower will rise, Brito expects that OODA\u2019s design will soon be joined by other high-rise companions. \u201cIn Albania, the years to come \u2014 let\u2019s say the next 10 to 15 years \u2014 will be something really special,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/22/style/bond-tower-tirana-albania/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "world"}}

Heat has killed 27 people in the county, which is home to Phoenix, and is suspected as the cause of at least 396 other deaths so far this year, according to figures released Tuesday. A total of 645 people died last year during the deadliest year for heat in the county since it started tracking the deaths in 2006. Nearly half of last year\u2019s deaths came during a stretch of the most intense heat from July 10 to July 25. Fewer deaths were under investigation during that time span than the 396 currently under investigation. It typically takes two-to-three months to complete a heat death investigation and 75% of deaths under investigation last year were confirmed as heat related, Jeff Johnston, Maricopa County\u2019s chief medical examiner, told CNN. Suspected heat deaths have soared in recent weeks alongside temperatures. About 100 of the suspected heat deaths this year happened from July 7 to 13, when high temperatures in Phoenix hit 118 degrees \u2013 exactly the kind of dangerous conditions scientists expect in a world warming due to fossil fuel pollution with more frequent, intense and long-lasting heat waves. \u201cWe certainly know that when we have higher temperatures that we see more heat-related illness, and in those who are at highest risk, there are more heat related deaths,\u201d Nick Staab, Maricopa County public health\u2019s assistant medical director, told CNN. \u201cThat correlation between the temperature and the number of deaths has been shown over time.\u201d Phoenix is currently experiencing its hottest start to summer on record. This June was hotter than last June, and this July has been nearly as warm as last July, which was the hottest month on record for any US city. Maricopa County said it is working to mitigate heat deaths by increasing the amount of cooling centers across the county, and lengthening operating hours for unsheltered individuals, the county\u2019s most vulnerable group to heat. Heat is the\u00a0deadliest form of weather\u00a0in the US, killing more than twice as many people each year on average as hurricanes and tornadoes combined. But heat deaths are still often undercounted, and there are many places that fail to report them accurately or regularly. A\u00a02020 study\u00a0found heat-related deaths were being underestimated in 297 of the country\u2019s most populous counties. Researchers said mortality records tend to neglect other potentially heat-related causes of death, like heart attacks. Maricopa County changed the way it tracks heat-related deaths last year to account for\u00a0how the death occurred and the factors that led up to it. The previous tracking method only tracked death certificates that specified heat as the cause of death, and \u201cproduced undercounts,\u201d according to Johnston. Summer and heat in Arizona are far from over. Even though heat peaks in July in Phoenix, average high temperatures don\u2019t drop below 100 degrees until mid-September. So, with suspected heat-related deaths already so high, the coming months will prove even more deadly.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/23/weather/phoenix-arizona-heat-maricopa-county-climate/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "world"}}

Under the quota system, some 30% of sought-after civil service jobs are reserved for relatives of veterans who fought in Bangladesh\u2019s war of independence from Pakistan in 1971 - with many of the country\u2019s contemporary political elite related to that generation. Since the roles are linked to\u00a0job security and higher pay, the quota system has angered many in the country, particularly students and young people, as Bangladesh faces high unemployment levels. Dozens of people have reportedly been killed and hundreds injured in the violence, which saw demonstrators gather on streets and university campuses in the capital Dhaka and other cities. In 2018, the civil service quota system was scrapped following similar protests but in June the High Court reinstated it, ruling its removal unconstitutional. On July 10, the Supreme Court suspended the quotas for one month while it took up the case. On Sunday, the country\u2019s top court dismissed the earlier ruling that brought back the quotas, directing that 93% of government jobs will be open to candidates on merit, without quotas. Speaking to local media in Dhaka following the announcement, Shah Monjurul Hoque, a lawyer representing students said that the Supreme Court \u201cgave a final solution to this quota system.\u201d \u201cThat is 93% quota for general people, 5% quota for freedom fighters and their kin, 1% for ethnic minority community, and 1% for third gender and physically disabled,\u201d he said. Bangladesh Attorney General A.M. Amin Uddin told Reuters, \u201cI am hoping normalcy will return after today\u2019s ruling and people with ulterior motives will stop instigating people,\u201d noting that students \u201chave clearly said they are in no way part of the violence and arson that have taken place in Bangladesh since Monday.\u201d \u201cI will ask the government to find out the culprits behind the violence and take strict action against them,\u201d he added. Ahead of the ruling, Bangladesh on Sunday extended a curfew imposed on Friday to try to quell the violence and deployed soldiers to patrol the streets of the capital Dhaka, according to Reuters. According to local media, the curfew was extended until after the Supreme Court hearing and will continue for an \u201cuncertain time\u201d following a two-hour break for people to gather supplies, Reuters reported. CNN has tried to reach the prime minister\u2019s office, home affairs ministry, and police, but mobile and internet services appear to remain mostly down across the country after a government-imposed blackout. As of Saturday, internet monitoring site\u00a0NetBlocks said activity had remained at around 10% for more than 48 hours since services were cut Thursday.

{"id": "2024_07_22_americas_sable-island-shipwreck-scli-intl", "text": "A British-Canadian couple who were attempting to sail across the Atlantic have been found dead on an island off the east coast of Canada. Brett Clibbery, 70, and his wife, Sarah Packwood, 60, had been sailing on their 42-foot sailboat the SV Theros, but their bodies were found in a lifeboat that washed up on Sable Island, Nova Scotia, according to a statement from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), published July 12. The couple left Halifax Harbour, Nova Scotia on June 11 en route to the Azores, a group of Portuguese islands in the mid-Atlantic, around 2,000 miles away. They were reported missing on June 18 and their bodies were found on July 10. It is not clear why the couple abandoned the Theros and got into a lifeboat. An investigation is ongoing, the RCMP said. CNN has contacted the RCMP for comment. Sable Island is a 27-mile long sandbar around 186 miles southeast of Halifax. It is known as \u201cthe graveyard of the Atlantic\u201d and there have been more than 350 recorded shipwrecks there since 1583, according to the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic.

{"id": "2024_07_22_china_china-floods-climate-change-intl-hnk", "text": "As temperatures soared across parts of central China\u2019s agricultural heartland last month, farmers struggled with day after day without rain. In sweltering Henan province, many scrambled to irrigate parched crops during what is usually a key growing period, while authorities ordered water use to be limited and for clouds to be artificially seeded in an effort to prod rain clouds, state media reports said. Just one month later, however, parts of the province were awash \u2013 pounded by extreme rain\u00a0that inundated tens of thousands of acres of cropland and forced more than 100,000 people to evacuate their homes, according to state media. Parts of Henan\u2019s hardest-hit Nanyang city saw more than 600 millimeters (about 24 inches) of rain in 24 hours\u00a0\u2013 three-quarters of what they would normally expect in a whole year. Rescuers navigated streets on speedboats, at times wading through waist-deep floodwaters to pluck people from their homes, footage circulating online showed. It\u2019s a story playing out across China. In the past two weeks, tens of thousands have been evacuated across multiple provinces in the country following deadly floods and landslides, which have blocked highways, destroyed homes and caused devastating financial losses as they wiped out crops and livestock. The lurch from dry weather to flooding also throws into sharp focus the major challenge for the Chinese government as emergency response and recovery becomes a regular occurrence \u2013 and as extreme weather is only expected to become more frequent due to human-driven climate change. The flooding in Henan and surrounding provinces last week \u2013 and the double hit of arid heat and floods in a matter of weeks \u2013 has prolonged what has already been a devastating period of extreme weather across China that\u2019s forecast to continue. Torrential rainfall has hit southern, central and eastern parts of the country and led to major emergency response efforts\u00a0in a flood season that has started some two months ahead of its typical schedule and only last week entered what\u2019s known as its peak period. China\u2019s ruling Communist Party acknowledged the urgency of the situation last week, when a communique following a landmark meeting of its top members led by Chinese leader Xi Jinping pledged to \u201crefine the measures for monitoring, preventing, and controlling natural disasters, especially floods.\u201d The government has in recent years grown increasingly alert to the domestic risk of climate change \u2013 including its potential impact on food security as drought and floods hit lands critical for the national grain supply. China, the world\u2019s largest greenhouse gas emitter, has looked to position itself as a leader in the global transition to green energy \u2013 even as it\u2019s met challenges weaning itself off coal due to high demand for power. Authorities are meanwhile grappling with the latest crises amid mounting social frustration with China\u2019s stuttering economy and the broader direction of the country \u2013 and as local governments\u00a0strapped with high levels of debt are tasked with recovery efforts. Before last week\u2019s floods, natural disasters\u00a0had already cost nearly $13 billion in direct economic losses and affected 32 million people this year, China\u2019s Ministry of Emergency Management said on July 12. \u201cLast night I couldn\u2019t sleep at all,\u201d one farmer in Henan\u2019s\u00a0Nanyang city said as he surveyed submerged crop fields in a video posted to social media and shared by a government-linked account. \u201cAll my hard work for a year has come to nothing.\u201d Deepening challenge As the heavy rains moved across central China in recent days, accounts of loss and devastated livelihoods also spread across social and local media. At least 34 people have been killed since last weekend due to flooding and landslides, including 15 who died in a bridge collapse in Shaanxi province Friday following flash floods and heavy rain. It comes after flooding and landslides late last month killed at least 71 people in southern China. One video posted on social media showed a farmer in Sichuan province wading through chest-high waters to pick corn \u2013 clearly determined not to lose his harvest. Meanwhile, a farmer in flood-hit Hunan lost more than 800 pigs \u2013 taking a hit of about $275,000 \u2013 after his barn was inundated this month, he told state-backed Agricultural Television. Retailers and farmers have also taken to social media to sell flooded crops at a discount \u2013 for many a last-ditch attempt to salvage an income in a country where research shows insurance coverage is low compared with other major economies. As of Sunday, 10 provinces were under emergency alerts for flooding, according to national weather authorities, with more heavy rain expected in the coming days. A typhoon that hit China\u2019s Hainan island Monday is expected to make landfall on the mainland as a tropical storm Tuesday, while a cyclone that could strengthen to a typhoon is expected to hit coastal China later this week, according to CNN Weather. China\u2019s government has mounted a top-down effort\u00a0to revamp how the country responds to extreme weather in recent years after 2021 floods in Henan\u2019s Zhengzhou killed more than 300 people. And climate scientists earlier this month issued a stark warning, calling the country a \u201chotspot where the impacts of climate change are acutely felt.\u201d Observers say authorities have made progress, especially when it comes to early warnings and response, weather monitoring and certain infrastructure development \u2013 but they also note more must be done in China \u2013 like many countries grappling with climate change \u2013 to prepare for the impact of more frequent extreme weather. \u201cWhile policies and strategies are being developed and implemented, the pace and scale of action often fall short of what is needed to effectively mitigate the risks and impacts of climate change,\u201d said Hongzhang Xu, an adjunct research fellow at the Australian National University. That need may be more acute in remote, rural or mountainous regions, often populated by vulnerable elderly populations and with fewer resources, as well as provinces not historically prone to severe flooding, like in China\u2019s northeastern breadbasket, which endured extreme rains last year. Guangtao Fu, a professor of water intelligence at the University of Exeter in the United Kingdom, said that although the government has been investing in water infrastructure to boost flood protection there was a \u201csignificant gap\u201d in investment to maintain existing systems. That urgency was underscored earlier this month when a dike alongside China\u2019s second-largest freshwater lake burst after 17 days of heavy rains \u2013 flooding nearly 20 square miles of land and displacing at least 7,000 people, according to official reports. Another challenge, experts say, is bolstering recovery from severe flooding, where damaged croplands, destroyed homes and devastated livelihoods can take months to recover. Local governments are typically tasked with managing reconstruction efforts, while the central government plays a role in planning and financing. But there have been past issues of misappropriation of state recovery funds, for example following the deadly 2021 floods in Zhengzhou. And only about 8% of an aggregate $25 billion in losses in China from flooding caused by Typhoon Doksuri last summer were covered by insurance, according to data from global insurance firm Munich Re. \u201cFarmlands need to be re-plowed, and fully restoring soil quality would take several months,\u201d said Li Zhao, a senior researcher at Greenpeace East Asia in Beijing. \u201cFor the residential houses, each household should spend a lot of money to rebuild \u2013 just to recover from this kind of event is very difficult.\u201d Those living in flood-prone areas also face a tough choice as the risks grow, she added. \u201cMaybe in the future, we will see how people make the decision,\u201d she said. \u201cAre they moving to a safer place? Or will they go back to the villages (and rebuild)?\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/22/china/china-floods-climate-change-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "world"}}

Hundreds of cities in nearly every US state \u2013 including parts of Alaska and Hawaii \u2013 are on track for one of their 10-warmest summers on record. About 100 of these cities are enduring their hottest start to summer on record. The deadly heat has not been unexpected. Forecasters have been warning of a searing\u00a0summer for months due to the troubling combination of a budding La Ni\u00f1a and a world warming due to fossil fuel pollution. Last summer was the warmest on record globally and one of the warmest for several states. But so far, this summer has felt even worse for many in the US. Extreme heat has baked almost all of the\u00a0Lower 48 so far this summer, but the worst of it has concentrated in the East Coast states and West. Average daily temperatures \u2013 calculated by taking the average of each day\u2019s high and low \u2013 have soared several degrees above normal for hundreds of cities since June 1. These temperatures are a more complete indicator of how hot the season has been, as they factor in both hotter days and warmer nights. Summer nights in the US have been warming nearly twice as fast as summer days since records began in the late 1800s, according to data from NOAA. Warmer nights increase the danger of heat by compounding heat stress through a reduction in the amount of time the body has to cool down naturally. Las Vegas is experiencing its hottest summer on record and holds the top spot in the entire country. Many of the cities experiencing the most exceptional summer heat are in the West, notably in or near California\u2019s Central Valley. Searing heat there has been relentless since it started in early June. On the opposite coast, a historic mid-June heat wave has only been spelled by brief bouts of relief. Dozens of cities from New England to the Mid-Atlantic are experiencing their hottest start to the summer on record, including Washington, DC, which just smashed a high temperature record Tuesday when it hit 104 degrees. Some of the most abnormal heat in the region is focused in New England and New York state. The\u00a0South has also sweltered under more than its fair share of historic heat so far this summer.\u00a0Atlanta and Tampa, Florida, are both on pace to record their hottest summer on record.\u00a0For some locations in the region, it\u2019s the second consecutive year summer has had a blistering start. Last summer ended up quite warm for the Lower 48, but the worst heat was confined to the Gulf Coast. By mid-July last summer, the season was pacing as one of the warmest on record for cities nearest the coast, including cities like New Orleans, Houston and Brownsville, Texas. But in other parts of the country, last summer was downright cool compared to this year\u2019s extreme heat. Washington, DC, is currently on track to record its hottest summer on record, but it was only the 44th-warmest summer by this time last year. Sacramento, California, is experiencing its hottest start to summer on record. But this time last year California\u2019s capital city was experiencing is 62nd-warmest summer. Forecasts for the rest of the season aren\u2019t cool, either.

Crimes including rape, domestic abuse, stalking and harassment increased by 37% in the past five years, the report found \u2013 a \u201cstaggering\u201d increase that has prompted the UK Home Office to classify VAWG as \u201ca national threat to public safety.\u201d The figures were revealed Tuesday in a 70-page report \u2013 the first national analysis of the scale of VAWG by the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council (NPCC). Maggie Blyth, the NPCC\u2019s lead for VAWG, said the situation had become \u201ca national emergency,\u201d and that violence has reached \u201cepidemic levels \u2026 in terms of its scale, complexity and impact on victims.\u201d \u201cWe need the support and direction of government to intervene and address the current problems within the criminal justice system and lead the way on a whole-system approach to VAWG,\u201d she said. Keir Starmer, the new prime minister, announced his government will bring forward plans to halve violence against women and girls. The report identified five \u201ccritical threats\u201d to women and girls which make up an estimated 3,000 VAWG-related crimes recorded across England and Wales each day. In the year ending March 2023 in England and Wales, police recorded more than 100,000 rape and serious sexual offenses, more than 400,000 domestic abuse-related crimes, some 436,000 stalking and harrassment offenses, and more than 40,000 child sexual abuse and exploitation offenses, committed against girls aged between 10 and 17. \u201cThese are cautious estimates as we know much crime goes unreported and in policing, we often only see the tip of the iceberg,\u201d the report said. Of the 2 million women and girls who experience violence each year, 1.4 million are subjected to domestic abuse, according to the report. In the year ending March 2023, one in every six homicides were domestic abuse-related. In cases of rape and serious sexual offenses, suspects are more likely to be an ex- or current partner (38%) or individuals known to the victim (29%) compared to a stranger (26%). The average suspect age in reported instances of rape and serious sexual offense in England and Wales is 37, the report said, though the recorded age range of suspects is from 10 years old to 100. There has been a 435% increase in child sexual abuse and exploitation in England and Wales between 2013 and 2022, the report said. Of these crimes, 93% involve contact sexual offenses and sexual grooming. The average age of victims in these cases is 13 years old, while the average age of suspects is 15 years old, it said. More than half of child sexual abuse and exploitation cases reported between January and July 2023 were also committed by children. The police report also acknowledged that, while crimes against women and girls are increasing in number, perpetrators are often not punished for their actions. As of March 2023, only 4.4% of domestic abuse cases recorded by police resulted in the perpetrator being convicted, the report said. The reasons for this include limited prison capacities and huge backlogs in courts. The UK\u2019s Minister for Safeguarding Jess Phillips wrote in a post on social media that the report\u2019s findings show that VAWG is a \u201cnational emergency\u201d and a \u201cthreat\u201d to Britain\u2019s security and prosperity. Blyth added that the NPCC is \u201cabsolutely determined to turn the tide on violence and abuse faced by women and girls and will continue to work tirelessly to do better for victims.\u201d \u201cWe need the support and direction of government to lead the way on a whole-system approach to VAWG,\u201d Blyth said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/23/uk/uk-police-violence-women-girls-epidemic-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_17_americas_venezuela-election-maduro-bloodbath-speech-intl-latam", "text": "The United States has raised concerns about the recent arrests of Venezuelan democratic opposition figures ahead of the country\u2019s elections this month, as authoritarian President Nicolas Maduro told his supporters he must win at the polls to avoid a possible \u201cbloodbath.\u201d \u201cIf they do not want Venezuela to fall into a bloodbath, into a fratricidal civil war,\u201d the ruling party must win the presidential elections on July 28, Maduro told a campaign event in Caracas on Tuesday. Only a win for his party would ensure \u201cpeace\u201d in the country, Maduro said, adding that he expects \u201cirreversible results\u201d in his favor. CNN has reached out to Maduro\u2019s office for further comment on his statements. Maduro\u2019s remarks come as his government attempts to cling on to power for another six years while facing a credible challenge from opposition candidate Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia. Many experts believe the opposition has a real chance of pushing Maduro out of office. In the run up to the vote, Venezuela has \u201cunjustly detained\u201d democratic opposition figures, civil society members and journalists, according to the US State Department, which called for their release in a statement Wednesday. Strongman Maduro has been in power in for more than a decade, having assumed the presidency following the death of predecessor Hugo Chavez in 2013, during which time his government has often been accused of rigging votes and silencing the opposition. The 2018 election that returned Maduro to office was largely boycotted by the opposition. The poll was described as illegitimate by an alliance of 14 Latin American nations, Canada and the United States and as a \u201cfarce\u201d by the Organization of American States. There were hopes the 2024 election might be different after Maduro promised Washington last year in a historic agreement that he would hold free and fair elections in exchange for sanctions relief. However, more recently the opposition has accused him of reneging on that pledge. Two opposition candidates \u2013 Maria Corina Machado and Corina Yoris \u2013 have been barred from running while a report this week by a human rights group suggested there had been a spate of \u201carbitrary detentions\u201d since the beginning of the campaign season on July 4. Human rights NGO Laboratorio de Paz reported Monday there had been 71 arbitrary detentions in the first 10 days of campaigning, the majority of them involving people who had provided some type of service to the campaign command of the opposition candidate Gonz\u00e1lez, of the Democratic Unitary Platform. Two days after Laboratorio\u2019s report came out, the barred opposition leader Machado said in a post on X that her security chief had also been arrested. Machado said her security chief Milciades \u00c1vila was \u201ckidnapped\u201d on Wednesday \u201cby the Maduro regime and accused of gender violence against some women.\u201d The opposition leader said the women who accuse \u00c1vila of gender violence tried to \u201cattack\u201d her and Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia in a restaurant last Saturday. \u201cThere are dozens of witnesses and videos that demonstrate that this was a planned provocation to leave us without protection 11 days before July 28,\u201d Machado wrote. CNN has reached out to Venezuela\u2019s Attorney General\u2019s Office for comment on \u00c1vila\u2019s arrest and to determine whether he has legal representation. The US was concerned about \u00c1vila\u2019s arrest and called for his immediate release, a State Department spokesperson said Wednesday. The US also urged Venezuela to release all those who were \u201cunjustly detained\u201d during the presidential election campaign. Costa Rica, Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Panama meanwhile called on Venezuelan authorities to guarantee that elections are \u201cfree, fair, and transparent,\u201d in a joint statement released Wednesday by the Alliance for Development in Democracy. CNN has asked the Venezuelan Foreign Ministry for a response to the joint statement. Maduro is one of 10 candidates vying for the presidency, however, several of them have minimal support and are viewed by the main opposition as government allies.

{"id": "2024_07_17_style_rajesh-vora-punjab-architecture-snap", "text": "Looking down a street in Daulatpur, a rural village in Punjab, India with a mishmash of eclectic, colorful architecture, photographer Rajesh Vora felt he had struck lucky. In front of him, was a large facsimile of an Air-India plane on top of a pale green\u00a0building. Facing it from across the street, a replica of an army tank atop a yellow residence pointed its gun, the painted figure of a soldier rising from its hatch. Though the designs could have been plucked from an amusement park, they were actually elaborate rooftop water tanks of private homes. Vora\u2019s images of this phenomenon \u2014 a vernacular tradition of architectural icons that sprung up across the\u00a0across the northwestern state some five decades ago \u2014 became a multiyear project that the Mumbai-based photographer is\u00a0now exhibiting at Les Rencontres d\u2019Arles\u00a0in France this summer.\u00a0He visited 150 villages and photographed hundreds of these designs. The ostentatious d\u00e9cor is \u201ca brilliant idea combining form and function,\u201d Vora said in a phone call with CNN. The first time he noticed the water tanks while on assignment in the region in 2014, he was \u201camused, like anybody would be seeing this kind of sculpture,\u201d he explained. \u201cBut then I realized, as an architecture photographer, what amazed me was the integration of the sculptures on the houses, built by local artisans.\u201d Crowning the tops of these homes, the unusual status symbols are often commissioned by Indian emigrants\u00a0who return home during the year, or by their families who still live in the region. Some are functional water tanks while others sit on top more traditional plumbing designs. Each tell a specific story, he explained. \u201cIf somebody plays sports, they\u2019ll put up a football there, if they are a chef they will put a pressure cooker\u2026 if somebody likes a nice drink, they\u2019ll put a bottle of whiskey,\u201d he explained. Planes, tanks and cars became popular motifs, too. \u201cAll their personal aspirations are embodied in their houses.\u201d Last year, Vora published a book, \u201cEveryday Monuments\u201d that features images from some the villages he visited and brings together texts from architectural, scholarly and curatorial experts to explore the unique tradition. Through their research, they approximate that there are around 30 artisans in the region who work with homeowners and their families via word of mouth to create these lively sculptures. Diasporic icons Vora came across the buildings by chance, as he visited a gurdwara\u00a0\u2014 a Sikh temple \u2014 in the village of Talhan while working on a commissioned photo story about global migration. Known as Hawaijahaj, or \u201cAirplane,\u201d gurdwara, visitors bring offerings of model aircraft in hopes that they will be blessed with swift visa approval to leave India. He heard that many who were successful eventually returned to their villages to add planes to the exteriors of newly built homes, he explained. Over the course of six trips from 2014 to 2019, Vora began to better understand the full scope of the trend. It had begun sometime in the 1970s, as Punjabi diasporic communities flourished in Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States, among other countries.\u00a0As the popularity of custom-designed water tanks grew, local builders became specialized in their craft. The favored icons tend to shift in popularity over the years \u2014 when the country began manufacturing its popular Maruti van, for example, in the 1980s, it began appearing on homes, too. He also observed how architectural styles from different countries began to mix into the villages as owners brought back ideas from abroad to unique effect. But documenting the water tanks proved difficult when he first began. The remote areas of Punjab weren\u2019t yet mapped by Google, he explained, so he visited villages and hoped for the best. \u201cSome days are lucky \u2014 you might get three or four kinds of water tanks; others, you might not get anything,\u201d Vora said. Daulatpur Village, where multiple designs could be seen in one frame, was a rarity. Vora doesn\u2019t know how the tradition will grow or change as the region continues to see major shifts \u2014 especially as Indians from marginalized backgrounds gain more economic mobility and second- or third- generation immigrants amass wealth overseas. \u201cWill they come back to India? Will they build their own houses? Will they take care of these houses?\u201d We don\u2019t know,\u201d Vora said of younger generations. \u201cThese houses are perishable if you don\u2019t maintain them after 30 or 40 years\u2026 maybe they will disappear.\u201d The photographer hopes to continue to create an archive of Punjab\u2019s distinctive architectural legacy \u2014 and he\u2019ll keep looking out for a home that bears the icon of what he would choose if he were commissioning a design. \u201cIt would have to be a camera,\u201d he said with a laugh.

{"id": "2024_07_23_europe_gomorrah-slum-italy-collapse-intl-latam", "text": "Two people were killed and at least 13 injured Tuesday when an elevated walkway collapsed in a condemned Italian slum notorious for its links to organized criminal groups. The Italian Fire Brigade said a 29-year-old man and a 35-year-old woman were killed in the collapse at the Le Vele housing slum in the Neapolitan suburb of Scampia. More than 800 people were living as squatters in the apartment complex at the time, including 300 children, according to the fire brigade. All have been evacuated to tent camps set up by the country\u2019s civil protection agency. The complex was made famous in Roberto Saviano\u2019s \u201cGomorrah\u201d book, film and television series, which detailed the exploits of the Camorra, a powerful Neapolitan mafia-like group. Several criminal groups tied to the Camorra operated out of the apartments and wings, many of which were protected behind heavy fencing and bullet-proof glass, according to local police who regularly raided the buildings. It was also notorious as a venue for drug deals. The housing complex, built in the 1970s and 1980s, originally consisted of four apartment buildings shaped like sails (\u201cvele\u201d) joined by elevated walkways. But in 2020 regional authorities ordered the site to be cleared and razed. Since then, three of the buildings have been demolished and only one now remains. The cause of the collapse at that one remaining building is not yet clear, but the structure has been condemned for years and amenities like running water, electricity and gas are all brought in illegally. In recent years, the complex has been inhabited by people who lost their homes during a devastating earthquake in 1980 that killed nearly 2,500 people and left 250,000 homeless. Many of those people moved to the complex while waiting for new homes promised by the national government that never materialized. After the order to clear the complex in 2020, the local municipality launched a redevelopment project to house those still living at La Vele. That project is still ongoing but remains unfinished. Naples mayor Gaetano Manfredi expressed his condolences to those affected by the collapse and offered assistance to those who still live there. \u201cNow is the time to think about the victims \u2013 but I want to reiterate that our redevelopment project will not stop and our commitment to Scampia will be even stronger than before,\u201d Manfredi said. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni also expressed sadness at the news. \u201cIn this hour of pain, my condolences go to the victims\u2019 families together with a thought of closeness for the wounded and their loved ones,\u201d she wrote on social media. She also thanked emergency services for their help.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/23/europe/gomorrah-slum-italy-collapse-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_23_middleeast_israel-gaza-war-khan-younis-humanitarian-zone-intl", "text": "Dozens of Palestinians have been killed and thousands more forced to flee after Israel launched a fresh ground assault against what it said were Hamas targets in the southern Gazan city of Khan Younis. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) announced Monday that it was reducing the size of its so-called \u201chumanitarian zone,\u201d ordering Palestinians to evacuate from eastern neighborhoods of Khan Younis due to intelligence that Hamas had embedded in the area. CNN witnessed exhausted and angry Palestinians fleeing\u00a0Khan Younis, once Gaza\u2019s second-biggest city.\u00a0As they left,\u00a0they expressed anger not only at Israel but at Hamas and even other Arab states. The UN Human Rights Office (OHCHR) slammed the evacuation order Tuesday as \u201cconfusing\u201d and said it \u201cgave no time for civilians to know from which areas they were required to leave or where they should go.\u201d The Israeli ground incursion in Khan Younis follows similar operations in Shujayah in the north and parts of central Gaza, where military units have reentered areas to prevent Hamas from reestablishing a presence. The death toll from the operation continued to rise on Tuesday, as the\u00a0Hamas-run government media office said\u00a089 people had been killed and 263 injured so far, with nearly 200 buildings bombed. Dr. Mohammad Saqer, spokesman for Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis, told CNN Tuesday that\u00a0the\u00a0hospital had issued death certificates for 75 Palestinians killed since Monday morning, the majority of them women and children. Saqer said the hospital was dealing with more than 200 injuries, of which dozens are in serious and critical condition, and he expected the number of deaths to rise. \u201cImagine you want nearly 100 thousand people to evacuate in just two hours. It\u2019s not enough for people to evacuate, so that explains the high number of mortalities and casualties among civilians,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Jim Sciutto on Tuesday. Many patients were being admitted with missing limbs and \u201ccomplete burns of the body,\u201d including children, women and the elderly, Saqer said, adding that casualties are dying \u201con the floor\u201d due to a lack of beds and inadequate supplies. The\u00a0IDF\u00a0said Tuesday that\u00a0\u201caircraft struck over 50 terror infrastructure sites, including weapons storage facilities, observation posts, and structures used by Hamas terrorists, as well as underground tunnel routes in the area.\u201d Additionally, it said,\u00a0Israeli forces\u00a0had killed \u201cdozens of terrorists in targeted aerial strikes and close-quarters combat\u201d further south in Rafah. CNN cannot independently verify the IDF claims. Israel launched its military offensive on October 7 after Hamas attacked southern Israel. At least 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 others abducted, according to Israeli authorities. Israeli strikes in Gaza have since killed 39,090 Palestinians and injured another 90,147, according to the Ministry of Health there. CNN cannot independently verify the figures from Gazan authorities. Criticism of Israel, Hamas and Arab world A journalist working for CNN in Khan Younis filmed video Monday of thousands of people \u2013 many on foot or with donkey carts \u2013 carrying mattresses and their belongings. Most were women and children. One woman carrying a box screamed to the camera: \u201cFilm this, film it so people can see what\u2019s happening to us.\u201d A young girl is seen carrying a water bottle and crying loudly, walking through the destroyed street with her mother and siblings. At one point the sound of heavy gunfire close by sends\u00a0women and children screaming in panic. Children are seen running barefoot while carrying blankets and belongings. A man called Mohammad Abdul Jawad told CNN that \u201cThe (Israeli) army called us in the morning, ordering people in Abasan, Khuzaa, Al Zanneh, Al Qarara, and Bani Sehaila to evacuate. It all happened suddenly. They said go to the safe area, but there is no safe area in all of the Gaza Strip. They are making fun of us.\u201d \u201cWe left everything, our tents and everything inside them. Where should we go now? It is very hot, we have no money or anything, and no one cares about us.\u201d Jawad said that Israeli tanks had been about 500 meters (1,600 ft) away. A few people expressed anger toward Arab states for not doing more to help.\u00a0Um Hazem Sammoun, walking with her\u00a0children, asked: \u201cWhere are the Arab world and the Arab leaders? Let them come look at our children. We don\u2019t know where we are going or where we are walking to. I didn\u2019t want to leave, but when the warplanes and tanks started the bombardment, I was scared for my four children\u2026\u00a0I swear I am walking and don\u2019t know where to go.\u201d Some of the evacuees even criticized Hamas. One woman told CNN: \u201cEvery day a new order to evacuate. There is no food, drinks, or safety. We are only evacuating from one place to another. Maybe we evacuate this life and never come back. Maybe this way Hamas will be happy. Hamas forced us to leave, not the Israelis.\u2019 A visibly angry man addressed the Hamas leadership, including the head of its military wing Yahya Sinwar, who is thought to be hiding in Gaza\u2019s immense tunnel network. \u201cDo you see our suffering, Sinwar and\u00a0(Hamas political leader Ismail)\u00a0Haniyeh? Until when? What do you want from us? What have you brought us?\u201d he asked. A mother, Riham Al Agha, holding her daughter\u2019s hand, told CNN: \u201cWe are tired, we are exhausted.\u00a0It is enough. You (Hamas) are staying underground and keeping the people here to be destroyed.\u201d \u201cUntil when should we keep evacuating from one area to another?\u201d Al Agha asked. \u201cWe have been evacuated\u00a010\u00a0times since October\u00a07. We want a solution. We are losing our children, that\u2019s enough.\u201d But much of the anger on the streets was also directed at Israel. A man who gave his name as Abu Sleiman told CNN: \u201cThe (Israelis) forced us out naked like this, we are without any weapons. Let them throw their tanks and come confront us. We are men and we will die as men, not Hamas and not Fatah.\u201d He accused the Israeli military of having \u201cno mercy or humanity. They are fighting civilians, women, and children.\u2019 UN decries \u2018inhumane conditions\u2019 for Gazans The evacuation order on Monday came in the form of the IDF dropping leaflets, sending text messages and posting messages on X, urging civilians in four southern Gaza municipalities to leave immediately. The areas included parts of the so-called humanitarian zone in Al-Mawasi, further shrinking the zone. One IDF post warned civilians in Khan Younis that it \u201cwill act forcefully against terrorist organizations. For your safety, you must evacuate immediately westward to the new humanitarian zone. The area you are in is considered a dangerous combat zone.\u201d The Gazan Civil Defense Directorate said the inclusion in the evacuation order of parts of the humanitarian zone had reduced it from 45 square kilometers to 28 square kilometers\u00a0(from 17 to 11 square miles). Along with a \u201csafe area\u201d in central Gaza, it meant that 1.7 million people were crammed into an area of just under 50 square kilometers,\u00a0it said. The\u00a0Civil Defense also alleged that its rescuers in Khan Younis had been targeted while trying to recover civilians. Human rights agencies have previously warned against Israeli evacuation orders issued without the promise of safety or secure accommodation for Palestinians trying to survive bombardment. On Monday, the UN Relief and Works Agency said the new evacuation orders in Khan Younis would lead to \u201cmore suffering and displacement\u201d for Palestinian families. \u201cPeople in Gaza are exhausted, living in inhumane conditions, with no safety at all,\u201d it posted on X. The OHCHR on Tuesday raised concerns about Israel\u2019s compliance with obligations under international law. \u201cConfusing mass evacuation orders issued by a party that is concurrently increasing the intensity of its attacks on the areas from which evacuation is ordered and through which people must move place civilians in more danger and may increase the harm to civilians,\u201d the agency said. Many of those displaced in Khan Younis have been forced to flee to Al-Mawasi, a sprawling tent city with sparse infrastructure, where there is scant access to shelter or life-saving humanitarian aid, the agency added. \u201cThis raises serious concerns regarding Israel\u2019s compliance with its obligation to take all feasible precautions to avoid, and in any event to minimize, incidental loss of civilian life and injury to civilians.\u201d Responding to criticism over the evacuation order, the IDF repeated to CNN that remaining in the area had become dangerous for civilians because of \u201csignificant terrorist activity and rocket fire toward the State of Israel from the eastern part of the\u00a0Humanitarian Area in the Gaza Strip.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/23/middleeast/israel-gaza-war-khan-younis-humanitarian-zone-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_23_asia_philippines-pogos-ban-illegal-gambling-intl-hnk", "text": "The Philippines has announced plans to ban offshore gaming operators, targeting an industry that mostly caters to Chinese gamblers and has sparked growing alarm from law enforcement over its alleged connections to organized crime. Known locally as POGOs, Philippine Offshore Gaming Operators have spawned across the country, both licensed and illicit, employing tens of thousands of Chinese and foreign nationals. But in a state of the nation address Monday, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. announced a total shutdown of the industry. \u201cEffective today, all POGOs are banned,\u201d Marcos said to a standing ovation from lawmakers as he underlined the growing concern in the Philippines over the explosion of the offshore casino industry. \u201cDisguising as legitimate entities, their operations have ventured into illicit areas furthest from gaming, such as financial scamming, money laundering, prostitution, human trafficking, kidnapping, brutal torture \u2013 even murder. The grave abuse and disrespect to our system of laws must stop,\u201d Marcos added. The ban comes as Marcos takes an increasingly hard line against Chinese-linked operations amid simmering diplomatic tensions between Manila and Beijing over their competing claims in the South China Sea. But China\u2019s government is likely to welcome the move. Gambling is banned in China \u2013 with the exception of Macao \u2013 and Beijing has recently clamped down on cross-border gambling, especially across Southeast Asia. There are over 40 licensed offshore gaming operators and dozens more illicit gambling hubs in the Philippines, according to the country\u2019s gaming regulator, which Marcos has ordered to close by the end of the year. The POGO sector emerged in the Philippines in 2016 under Marcos\u2019\u00a0relatively China-friendly predecessor Rodrigo Duterte, who critics say turned a blind eye to suspected illicit activities as the industry brought billions of pesos to state coffers. Since then, the Philippines has become a major hub for online gaming catering to tens of thousands of players based in China. In recent years, Southeast Asia has seen a surge of online scam syndicates raking in huge profits from victims around the world, including in China and the United States. During the coronavirus pandemic, many illicit casinos pivoted to scams when visitors dried up as borders closed. Many of those working for these scam syndicates are themselves victims of human trafficking. Most of the perpetrators in POGOs are from China but many of the victims are also Chinese, according to Jaime FlorCruz, Philippine ambassador to China. He told CNN that POGOs have persisted because it involves a lot of money that brings revenue into local treasuries and creates jobs in some areas of the Philippines, but that gaming hubs have spawned various criminal activities, tarnishing China\u2019s image to the Filipino public. \u201cAll things considered, the POGO ban is good for Philippine-China relations. It gives us a chance to cooperate on something that is mutually beneficial. It allows us to do something together for public good. Our two sides have been cooperating in intelligence exchange, and in identification and repatriation of Chinese citizens implicated in crimes,\u201d FlorCruz said. Some POGOs are based in abandoned malls, while others are found in converted parking lots or cheap rented offices that have come under increasing scrutiny from authorities in Manila, who say many are fronts for scam centers and other\u00a0crimes. In March, more than 800 Filipinos, Chinese and other nationals were rescued in a police raid of an online romance scam center posing as a casino about 100 kilometers north of the capital, the official Philippine News Agency reported, citing local authorities. Last month, the Chinese embassy in Manila said it appealed to the Philippines to ban POGO \u201cto root out this social ill,\u201d adding it had assisted Philippine authorities in shutting down five offshore gambling centers and repatriated nearly 1,000 Chinese citizens over the past year. CNN has contacted the Chinese embassy for comment on the ban announcement. In March, China\u2019s embassy in Singapore warned its citizens in the city state to avoid all forms of betting, reiterating that gambling overseas violates Chinese laws. \u201cEven if overseas casinos are legally opened, cross-border gambling by Chinese citizens is suspected of violating the laws of our country,\u201d the embassy said in a statement.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/23/asia/philippines-pogos-ban-illegal-gambling-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_23_travel_school-field-trip-date-with-destiny", "text": "Six little words \u2013 mundane to anyone else \u2013 electrified me: Boxed Lunch on the Capitol Steps. It was one line from an itinerary of an upcoming field trip to Columbia, the capital of South Carolina. I couldn\u2019t have been any more excited if I had been told we were headed to New York City or London. The trip arranged by our teachers was a week or so away, and I pored over the schedule multiple times a day. Every line and every stop set my hyperactive sixth-grade mind afire, but none more than the boxed lunch entry. Questions and thoughts raced through my head: What\u2019s a \u201cboxed\u201d lunch? What would be in it? Will it be enough food? Why are we eating on the Capitol steps? How weird! How exciting! Who does stuff like that? Well, my class would! This was around 1974, and I had made the hour-long drive with my parents from my small hometown of about 5,000 souls to big-city Columbia a handful of times by then. My father had taken me to a few University of South Carolina football and basketball games, and my mother had taken me shopping for clothes at the likes of Belk and Kmart. The latter was a mix of drudgery and delight; the former much more solid fun. Both, however, were under firm parental control. But this trip was different. We\u2019d be seeing adult things. Important things. Things with times and agendas. I\u2019d be in the center of the action. Grown-up action. It turned out that each stop \u2013 from a historic home tour to a planetarium \u2013 would influence and inform the rest of my life. And no place proved more prescient than those Capitol steps. Off to Columbia \u2013 and the past! Some parts of that short trip have eluded my memory. For instance, I can\u2019t recall for sure if we took a school bus or went caravan-style in a makeshift fleet of station wagons. I think the cars, but I can\u2019t take that to the bank. I also don\u2019t recall any incidents with my classmates. That\u2019s actually significant because I was that kid. You know, the oddball who was more comfortable around teachers and other adults than his classmates. But other parts of the trip \u2013 what we did and where we did it and how it affected me \u2013 remain crystal clear. Our first stop of the day was the Robert Mills House and Gardens. I already had an interest in history, but I had thought nothing about architecture. That was about to change. The rounded arches of the first floor and the columns on the second floor of the brick mansion fascinated me. And when they told us Mills also designed the Washington Monument, I was 100% sold. The visit boosted my interest in history, especially in touring historic sites, and sparked a lifelong,\u00a0 albeit amateurish, interest in architecture that\u2019s even made its way into my work for CNN Travel. A life-changing boxed lunch South Carolina\u2019s Capitol, popularly called the State House, was just blocks away and was our next stop. Today, the building sports a brownish-gold copper dome, but back in the mid-1970s, the exterior dome was green-tinged before a massive renovation. We took a tour of the amazing State House interior and from a perch in the balcony, we got to see legislators in action. (Again, memory fails if we were watching the House or the Senate). I had no idea what the lawmakers were doing that day, but I was certain it was vitally important. Probably the biggest day in legislative history! Up in the balcony, someone spotted one of my classmate\u2019s older brothers on the floor. He was serving as a page, and I felt a jolt. If he could be a page, maybe I could as well one day. Then it was time to embark on my recent obsession \u2013 it was time for the boxed lunch! The boxes were passed out, and there we were. Eating on the Capitol steps, as outlined and promised on paper. I have no memory what was inside those white cardboard boxes. Probably a sandwich, chips and a cookie, the usual items in one. I have no memory who I sat by. Probably on the outer edges of the group, where I was a less likely target of teasing. But to my dying day, I\u2019ll remember what I thought and how I felt. I had a profound feeling of inner calm. For in that moment, sitting on those steps, looking out over the grounds and the buildings lining downtown Columbia, I realized my future. I had seen only an old house and the inside of a legislature so far, but it was already enough. In just half a day, I knew in a confident, quiet way that this was my place. What I felt didn\u2019t feel like a hopeful prediction or even a longing. Deep in my heart, I was certain that one day I\u2019d be living in Columbia as a college student. As a Gamecock. Studying journalism. I\u2019d again be at this spot, in this city, in the center of the action. And that I\u2019d be ready for it. I had no doubt or hesitation \u2013 this would surely come to pass. As a kid riddled by doubts and disharmony, I don\u2019t think I had ever been more sure or more happy. The cosmos and crime The afternoon stops solidified the revelation I felt on the State House steps. Our next place to visit was the now-closed Gibbes Planetarium, just a short walk away from the State House and the USC campus. If the Mills House represented an interesting past, Gibbes represented an intriguing future. I already enjoyed space-related matters both real (the recent Apollo missions) and imaginary (\u201cStar Trek\u201d reruns). But the Gibbes experience took my otherworldly fascinations to the next level. The night sky program and all the exhibits were yet another escape hatch. While I was already dead-set at this age at being a newspaper reporter, I was getting back-up ideas and interests in mind \u2013 historian or astronomer. In one day, life was quickly becoming endless possibilities. Our next stop appealed to the crime show fan in me \u2013 a tour of the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division. Popularly known in the state by its acronym SLED, you might have seen the agency mentioned in coverage of the Alex Murdaugh case. While I didn\u2019t leave the tour of their facilities with back-up plans of being a detective, it was interesting to get a behind-the-scenes look. My main memories of the place are of microscopes in a crime lab, chemical smells \u2013 and a ridiculous rumor that a classmate had \u201cstolen some drugs\u201d while we were there. But I was on such a natural high that our last stop didn\u2019t bother me a bit as we pulled into a chain steakhouse (I think, but cannot swear, it was Western Sizzlin\u2019) for supper. Normally, situations like that back then would set me on edge. I was terrible at negotiating the intricacies of lunchroom politics. But I recall no such nerves this time. I had just been exposed to the exit ramp from small-town life. Plus, I already had gotten the taste for steak by that age. Win-win. From there, the memories of the day fade into nothingness. That\u2019s because nothing else mattered. I had already learned and experienced everything I needed to know. Back to the future Everything came to pass as I knew it would on that field trip. I applied to the University of South Carolina and was accepted. I signed up as a journalism major \u2013 over the objections of my parents \u2013 before my freshman year even started in 1980. I was even assigned a dorm on Main Street, which runs to the Capital complex on its north and south sides. Everything was coming together. I moved into my fifth-floor dorm room the first day they opened the building to students. Douglas was its name. It was an early \u201860s-style monstrosity and was one of six buildings accurately dubbed The Honeycombs because of their exteriors. The dorm was in rough shape \u2013 and perfect. Hardly anyone was there yet. I guess eager, nerdy freshmen came to campus on the first day. I didn\u2019t care. I had already waited six years for this moment. I wasn\u2019t going to wait another day. And I knew what I had to do. Within days of my arrival, I went across the street to an eatery called Stuffy\u2019s, bought a sub (a new kind of exotic sandwich to me) and proceeded to make the very short trek to the Capitol grounds. It was late afternoon. In August. In Columbia. You don\u2019t know a real summer until you experience that. But I liked hot, humid weather, particularly back then. Again, I can\u2019t remember exactly what I ordered beyond a sub. And it was in a bag, not a box. But I indulged in an oh-so-sweet victory lap and lunch on those Capitol steps to launch my new life. The life I knew all along I could make happen. And did. The steps would continue to play a role in my life. I\u2019d take a lunch there every so often to eat and think. I once saw a clogging performance there my freshman year. It was put on by members of the Presbyterian Student Center, and many of the students at that center would turn out soon enough to become lifelong friends. I\u2019d even stopped at the steps several times after I graduated to sit and remember my sixth-grade self. At CNN Travel, we often write about people traveling to other nations and continents and having epiphanies and experiences that start them on exotic new lives. I didn\u2019t have to go nearly that far. I didn\u2019t even spend the night. For me, it was a mere 60-mile, in-state field trip \u2013 culminating with a Boxed Lunch on the Capitol Steps \u2013 that proved to be my date with destiny.

{"id": "travel_powerful-passports-july-2024-henley", "text": "What\u2019s red on the outside, purple on the inside, and grants you access to 195 destinations around the world visa-free? It\u2019s the Singapore passport, and it\u2019s just been named the world\u2019s most powerful travel document in a quarterly ranking of the passports with the most international clout. For the past 19 years, the Henley Passport Index, created by London-based global citizenship and residence advisory firm Henley & Partners, has been tracking global freedoms in 227 countries and territories around the world, using exclusive data from the International Air Transport Association (IATA). The next passports to come close to Singapore\u2019s global swag are those of Japan, Germany, France, Italy and Spain, which jointly hold the No.2 spot and whose citizens can enjoy visa-free travel to 192 destinations. Then, at third place in the ranking, come South Korea, Sweden, Finland, Austria, Ireland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, all of which have the privilege of seamless jaunts to 191 destinations. The UK, which in the bygone days of 2014 held the top spot jointly with the United States, is in fourth place (190 destinations), alongside New Zealand, Norway, Belgium, Denmark and Switzerland. Australia and Portugal share the No.5 spot (189 destinations) while the US has dropped down to eighth place, with visa-free access to a modest 186 destinations. The widening gap While Singapore\u2019s magic number of 195 is a record high for both Singapore and the ranking, down at the other end of the scale, new lows are also being hit. Afghanistan has long been ranked the world\u2019s weakest passport by the index, but now its citizens can only travel to 26 countries without a visa \u2013 the lowest score recorded in the index\u2019s history of nearly two decades. Christian Kaelin, chair of Henley & Partners, said in a statement, \u201cThe global average number of destinations travelers are able to access visa-free has nearly doubled from 58 in 2006 to 111 in 2024. However, the global mobility gap between those at the top and bottom of the index is now wider than it has ever been.\u201d Nearly five billion people will take to the skies this year, across 39 million flights, according to estimates by the IATA. However, the real cost of air travel has dropped by over a third in that time, says IATA director general Willie Walsh, with airlines\u2019 profit per passenger now averaging out at just over $6 per passenger, \u201cbarely enough for a single espresso in a typical hotel caf\u00e9.\u201d African mobility Africa\u2019s richest man, Nigerian-born Aliko Dangote, complained at the recent Africa CEO Forum in Kigali that he needed 35 visas to travel around the continent - way more than a European visitor. Exclusive new research published in Tuesday\u2019s Henley & Partner\u2019s report compares Schengen visa rejection rates for African applicants to those from other regions. The findings, by Mehari Taddele Maru, Adjunct Professor at the School of Transnational Governance at the European University Institute, and Johns Hopkins University in Italy, were that around 30% of African Schengen visa applicants were rejected, compared to around 10% worldwide. Said Maru, \u201cThe European visa system clearly demonstrates a pre-determined bias against African applicants who face a triple whammy: lower passport power, higher visa rejection rates, and consequently, limited economic mobility.\u201d Multiple indexes Henley & Partners\u2019 list is one of several indexes created by financial firms to rank global passports according to the access they provide to their citizens. Arton Capital\u2019s\u00a0Passport Index\u00a0takes into consideration the passports of 193 United Nations member countries and six territories \u2013 Taiwan, Macao, Hong Kong, Kosovo, the Palestinian territories and the Vatican. Territories annexed to other countries are excluded. It\u2019s also updated in real time throughout the year, but its data is gathered by close monitoring of individual governments\u2019 portals. It\u2019s a tool \u201cfor people who travel, to provide accurate, simple-to-acess information for their travel needs,\u201d Arton Capital\u2019s founder Armand Arton told CNN in 2022. Arton\u2019s Global Passport Power Rank 2024 puts the United Arab Emirates in the top spot, with a visa-free/visa-on-arrival score of 179.

{"id": "2024_07_23_style_brat-summer-green-explained", "text": "A specific shade of retina-singeing chartreuse has become the defining color of summer 2024. Similar to the text message bubble sent from your iPhone, the vivid hue sits somewhere between 360 and 375 on the Pantone color chart. It is, of course, Brat green. Now synonymous with British pop star Charli XCX\u2019s chart-topping studio album, the cultural influence of \u201cBrat\u201d green knows no bounds. Last week, the official X account of the New York City Metropolitan Transportation Authority alerted commuters of train repairs using a \u201cBrat\u201d green graphic. 65-year-old Golden Globe-winning actor Kyle McLachlan posted an \u201cunofficial music video\u201d of himself lip syncing to a track from the album in a fluorescent green shirt. It has even crept into Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 universe. After President Joe Biden announced he would no longer be seeking re-election and instead endorsing Kamala Harris, Charli XCX took to X to offer her own seal of approval, proclaiming: \u201ckamala IS brat.\u201d Memes swiftly followed, as well as impossibly fast t-shirts with Harris\u2019 name printed in the style of the \u201cBrat\u201d album cover.\u00a0Even the Vice President\u2019s official rapid response account on X, @kamalahq, is now topped with a \u201cBrat\u201d style banner. Brat girl summer The hashtag #Bratsummer has been tagged in over 40,000 videos on TikTok and 12,000 posts on Instagram. The term has also been on a steady incline worldwide, according to Google Trends, since the first week of June. Google even predicts searches for \u201cBrat summer\u201d will reach their maximum popularity this week. The term \u201cBrat girl summer\u201d can be understood best as a battle cry \u2014 uniting all hedonists, fun-lovers and \u201c365 Party Girls.\u201d Last month, Charli XCX outlined the ingredients for a Brat girl summer to the BBC, citing \u201ca pack of cigs, a Bic lighter and a strappy white top with no bra.\u201d Some might consider Kamala Harris becoming the first Black woman and first Asian American to lead a major party ticket as Brat, because it\u2019s boundary-breaking, feminine and intersectional. At its core, embracing Brat culture is about messy, imperfect self-acceptance \u2014 and it\u2019s the easiest way right now to engage the under-30 demographic. As a result, the past weeks have become awash with lurid green, and fast. \u201cIt used to be that brands picked a color, but then it would be years before somebody associates that color with your brand,\u201d said Sunita Yeomans, leader of the Graphic Branding and Identity course at London College of Communication, in a video interview. Yeoman believes Charli XCX has managed to fast-track the process with \u201cspectacular\u201d success. She recently noticed a colleague was inadvertently wearing Brat green during an art gallery board meeting. \u201cI thought, \u2018Oh my God, she doesn\u2019t even realize she\u2019s wearing that color.\u2019 It got me thinking about when people don\u2019t even realize that they\u2019re endorsing (something).\u201d This isn\u2019t the first summer to have been color-coded by pop culture, either; it\u2019s the second in a row. Last year, moviegoers worldwide sported Barbie pink looks to see Greta Gerwig\u2019s record-smashing \u201cBarbie\u201d film, and it also hit red carpets and shaded music videos including\u00a0Ice Spice\u2019s pink dreamhouse backdrop in \u201cPrincess Diana.\u201d Pinterest searches for \u201cBarbie pink\u201d in both the US and UK were up 100% in 2023 compared to 2024, and fashion search engine Lyst named pink their trend of the year in 2022, thanks to a 416% increase in searches for hot pink clothing. But what goes into creating an era-defining shade? \u201cColor is a language,\u201d said Laurie Pressman, vice president of Pantone. \u201cWe gravitate towards color, and our relationship with color oftentimes happens outside of our consciousness.\u201d The color authority was partly responsible for the world domination of Barbie pink months before the film even premiered. For Valentino\u2019s fall-winter runway in March 2022, Pressman and her team collaborated with Pier Paolo Piccioli, the fashion house\u2019s creative director at the time, for the hue \u201cPink PP\u201d (colloquially known as \u201cValentino pink\u201d) \u2014 the sole color used in the collection. It became the shade du jour: Florence Pugh made headlines in a sheer tulle Valentino Pink number for the label\u2019s haute couture show in that July; while earlier in the year, not one but three celebrities arrived at the Met Gala dressed in the shade. \u201c(Piccioli)\u00a0 wanted this (color) to be a cultural touchstone,\u201d Pressman told CNN in a video interview, adding that it\u2019s \u201cabout being bold\u201d and \u201cstanding out.\u201d And, as a sister shade to red, she pointed out, it expanded the brand\u2019s legacy with the color Rosso Valentino. Although Pantone were also the ones who standardized 219C \u2014 better known as Barbie pink \u2014 in the 1990s, Pressman insists Valentino pink\u2019s serendipitous overlap with the \u201cBarbie\u201d marketing machine was \u201ca complete coincidence.\u201d Plus, the two shades are different, with Barbie pink being \u201ca little bit more neon,\u201d she said. Building the \u2018Bratosphere\u2019 While Barbie pink has a long, storied history, Brat green is fresh out the gates. It was created by design studio Special Offer Inc., who spent months discussing the shade, eventually selecting Brat green from around 500 options, according to founder Brent David Freaney. \u201cCharli knew exactly what she wanted, probably long before she even engaged with us,\u201d Freaney told CNN in a phone interview. \u201cWe spent months just talking about color and color references. \u2018What does this shade of green mean versus this shade of green? What\u2019s the connotation?\u2019\u201d While walking around New York City, Freaney would stop to take photos of any green object that might fit in the \u2018bratosphere\u2019 \u2014 a term coined by Charli XCX herself. \u201cThen I\u2019d take (these pictures) to my computer and use the (Photoshop) eyedropper tool to make that green and present it. Like, \u2018I saw this traffic cone outside. What do we think about that?\u2019\u201d For Yeoman, the science of a summer-stealing color mostly boils down to how a shade performs online and IRL. \u201cIf you look at Brat green on a screen, it zings,\u201d she said. \u201cBarbie pink does the same thing. It\u2019s about finding a shade that works both when it\u2019s backlit on a screen and also in real life.\u201d Freaney says they didn\u2019t want a shade that felt conventional. \u201cWe knew we didn\u2019t want a darker green or a mint green,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cWe were like, \u2018Let\u2019s choose something that feels really off-putting.\u201d Because of the color\u2019s specificity, spotting it out in the wild \u2014 much like Freaney\u2019s research process \u2014 has become a surefire way to go viral and add to the bratosphere. Stephanie, a Charli XCX fan based in New York, created the Instagram account @accidentallybrat in June, just after the album\u2019s release, and now receives photo submissions of Brat green sightings from friends and other fans. Her posts include a stack of Lime bikes, an estate sale poster and a pyromorphite mineral in a science museum. \u201cIt\u2019s just so fun,\u201d she told CNN over email. \u201cEvery time I\u2019m with a friend walking on the street someone stops to yell, \u2018Brat!\u2019 when we see anything green. It\u2019s so iconic and eye-catching \u2014 if you see anything online with that color you immediately know what it\u2019s referencing.\u201d A colorful future Though Pantone has been quietly creating specific shades for musicians for decades \u2014 Pressman has standardized everything from Rolling Stones red to Prince purple, though it\u2019s up to brands if they want to enter into the elusive trademarking process themselves \u2014 Pressman thinks both artists and audiences are increasingly paying attention to color. The specific shade of lavender Olivia Rodrgio has worn on several red carpets, including the 2022 Met Gala, is the same hue of her latest album \u201cGuts,\u201d and the color of most of her merchandise. Ice Spice, too, has become synonymous with her mop of fiery orange hair \u2014 and often matches her step-and-repeat looks to the shade.\u00a0\u201cSome of these very young artists who are really looking to express themselves and are turning to color as one more way to get their message out,\u201d Pressman said. \u201cWhich I think is very savvy.\u201d Brat green might have claimed this summer, but the color wheel will spin again before long. \u201cThat\u2019s just the way the design industry works,\u201d said Yeomans, who believes more labels will scramble to brand summer 2025. \u201cEveryone always catches onto a trend, and then everyone tries to do it, but only a handful will actually succeed.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/23/style/brat-summer-green-explained/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_20_style_leather-clothes-summer-trend-lotw", "text": "As the sun baked down on New York City on Tuesday, warming the concrete jungle to temperatures upwards of 80 degrees, actor and \u201cLonglegs\u201d star Maika Monroe stepped out in a surprising textile: Patent sheep leather. Similarly, last week, Monroe arrived at the LA premiere of the 1990s-inspired serial killer thriller dressed in a Courr\u00e8ges leather sarong and matching bra. Both outfits seemed like a bold choice for what is shaping up to be a sweltering summer across many parts of the Northern Hemisphere. But Monroe isn\u2019t alone in choosing this unseasonal material. Despite it being July, Mia Goth \u2014 another veritable scream queen \u2014 opted for a leather corseted midi dress from Versace for her appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live earlier this month. And at the premiere of \u201cMaXXXine\u201d in LA, Goth wore an edgy Ludovic de saint Sernin halter-neck dress \u2014 the main event being her peek-a-boo leather bralet. You don\u2019t have to be a horror film starlet to pull off a summer leather look, either. On July 11, Kate Hudson was snapped in Manhattan\u2019s Soho in a sultry pair of lace-up leather pants; while across the pond, British radio and TV presenter Vick Hope arrived at Wimbledon in a full burgundy leather vest, shorts and a collarless leather overcoat (granted, London\u2019s weather has been a little more accommodating to leather this summer). Rita Ora \u2014 who has, it seems, committed to exclusively wearing scarlet in promotion of her new film \u201cDescents: The Rise of Red\u201d \u2014 wore not one, but two entirely leather outfits around New York. At what point did we start to see the off-season potential of leather? Once a firm staple of winter wardrobes, the material is seemingly summer\u2019s hottest trend. It began with Bottega Veneta, the Italian fashion house largely credited with pushing the boundary of the textile \u2014 symbolically and literally. In September 2022, creative director Matthieu Blazy sent a stream of leather optical illusions down the Fall-Winter runway.\u00a0Since then, we\u2019ve had blue jeans, plaid shirts and woven beach bags rendered in meticulous detail, redefining what leather could be. Or could it be a case of a trickle-down effect from our reigning pop stars?

At least 50 people have been killed during the protests and more than 400 injured, according to the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights. Widely shared social media posters encourage protesters to close all roads leading to the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport and cause a \u201ctotal shutdown.\u201d Authorities said in a statement on Monday night that they increased security at the airport and warned against trespassing on protected areas, saying it was an offense punishable by law. \u201cWe urge all individuals participating in demonstrations to respect these legal provisions from attempting to enter or interfere with protected areas,\u201d acting Inspector General of Police Douglas Kanja said. The youth-led protests began last month after national outrage about a controversial finance bill that would have dramatically raised taxes on basic commodities. After President William Ruto was forced to pull the bill, demonstrators shifted their attention to protesting against his legitimacy, corruption in his government and police brutality. Renewed anger Ruto on Friday renominated six ministers after he fired the entire cabinet last month due to public pressure, reigniting public anger over their renomination. The cabinet nominees still need parliamentary approval, but they\u2019re likely to be confirmed since Ruto\u2019s party holds the required majority.

Archaeologists in the square outside the Archbasilica of St John Lateran in the city center unearthed a complex architectural structure including walls believed to have protected the Patriarchio, a monumental basilica envisaged by Emperor Constantine in the 4th century, the ministry said in a statement. \u201cThis is an extraordinarily important find for the city of Rome and its medieval history, as no extensive archaeological excavations have ever been carried out in the square in modern times,\u201d the ministry said.

{"id": "2024_07_23_sport_swimmers-anger-alleged-chinese-doping-scandal", "text": "The director of an international sports advocacy group has a warning for organizers of the Olympic Games ahead of next week\u2019s competitions in the pool: The doping scandal that plagued the sport in recent months isn\u2019t going away. Ever since the New York Times reported in April that 23 Chinese swimmers had all tested positive for the same banned substance ahead of the Tokyo Olympics and were still allowed to compete at the games in 2021, resentment and frustration has been simmering in the water. Eleven of those Chinese swimmers are due to compete again in Paris, and many of their rivals are preparing to go against them with a sense of bitter resignation. Rob Koehler, director of international sports advocacy group Global Athlete, told CNN that they are already anticipating the worst. \u201cIf any of those 11 Chinese swimmers hit a podium,\u201d he said, \u201cthey will absolutely lose it.\u201d The Chinese swimmers tested positive for the banned performance enhancing drug Trimetazidine at a national meet several months before the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, but China\u2019s Anti-Doping Agency (CHINADA) said that the concentration was \u201cextremely low.\u201d CHINADA decided that the swimmers were not responsible for the results because the drug had been accidentally ingested via some contaminated food. The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) was notified of the test results a month before the games in 2021 and accepted CHINADA\u2019s conclusion, because, according to WADA\u2019s President Witold Ba\u0144ka, they found \u201cno credible way to disprove the contamination theory that was accepted by CHINADA.\u201d CNN has reached out to CHINADA for comment on this story. In a statement, WADA stood by its previous decision-making and said an independent prosecutor had confirmed that its conclusions were reasonable. \u201cWADA will consider with external legal counsel what measures can be taken against those who continue to make untrue and defamatory allegations. These allegations have been extremely damaging to WADA\u2019s reputation and to the confidence and trust that athletes and other stakeholders have in the Agency and in the global anti-doping system,\u201d the statement read. Three years after the failed drug tests and three months after they became known to the rest of the swimming community, the scandal only continues to grow. On July 9, the US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) released a scathing statement about the handling of the affair, asking pointed questions about how on earth the drug had been present in the kitchen where the swimmers\u2019 food was being prepared, and why WADA so readily accepted the Chinese explanation. USADA CEO Travis Tygart concluded by saying, \u201cFrom the beginning, our goal has been uncovering the truth and the facts of this situation on behalf of clean athletes. Until WADA leadership shares that goal and stops spewing vitriol at any voice of dissent, there will be no trust in the global anti-doping system. WADA\u2019s credibility is crumbling before the world\u2019s eyes.\u201d The case is now being investigated by the US Justice Department, which can criminally prosecute those who help athletes dope at international competitions, even if they didn\u2019t happen in the United States. Watching from the sidelines is the retired American swimmer Michal Phelps, the most decorated Olympian of all time. Seven years ago, the winner of 23 gold medals testified to Congress about his frustration of the handling of the widespread Russian doping scandal, and he was back in Congress in June to note that nothing has changed. \u201cSitting here once again, it is clear to me that any attempts of reform at WADA have fallen short,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are still deeply rooted, systemic problems that prove detrimental to the integrity of international sports and athletes\u2019 right to fair competition.\u201d Another American swimmer, Allison Schmitt, also testified. She swum in the 800-meter freestyle relay, her team finishing a close second to the Chinese. \u201cWe raced hard. We trained hard,\u201d she said, \u201cWe followed every protocol. We accepted our defeat with grace. Many of us will be haunted by this podium finish that may have been impacted by doping.\u201d The swimmers heading to Paris feel that they can no longer count on the authorities to protect the integrity of the sport and they are starting to take matters into their own hands. In a meeting with a group of swimmers and their coaches in the run-up to the Games, Koehler described the mood as concerned, confused and angry. He said athletes feel as though World Aquatics and the World Anti-Doping Agency have failed them and that nobody outside of the sport is paying attention. While none of those swimmers want to publicly comment on the situation ahead of the Games, Koehler believes that they will publicly protest if any one of the 11 Chinese athletes win a medal. Given that the International Olympic Committee strictly prohibits any kind of dissent on the podium, it\u2019s unclear what such a protest in an Olympic event would look like. World Aquatics is even more restrictive of the right to protest after Australia\u2019s Mack Horton refused to share the podium with China\u2019s Sun Yang at the World Championships in 2019. On behalf of those athletes, Global Athlete says it will publish the names of the tainted Chinese swimmers on the eve of the Games and again before every impacted event, stating that both they and the international aquatics community have been failed by the authorities. \u201cCHINADA never notified the athletes of a positive test, and they basically swept it all under,\u201d Koehler explained. \u201cThey were never provisionally suspended; they were never given a chance to explain. Basically, the Secret Service in China did their own thing, which is obviously suspect. World Aquatics and the World Anti-Doping Agency are to blame for not upholding the rules.\u201d Koehler believes that either the Chinese were the unknowing victims of a state-sponsored doping scheme, or that they were involved in an \u201covert scheme involving a backroom deal to protect the athletes of a powerful nation.\u201d In any case, he says, it\u2019s imperative that the names of those swimmers are known: \u201cThey are attending the Games, where the cloud of suspicion remains.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/23/sport/swimmers-anger-alleged-chinese-doping-scandal/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_22_africa_uganda-anti-corruption-protest-intl", "text": "Uganda\u2019s hardline President Yoweri Museveni has warned citizens planning anti-corruption protests Tuesday that they are \u201cplaying with fire.\u201d The upcoming protests come after a wave of deadly anti-government demonstrations that rattled neighboring country Kenya where at least 50 people were killed in clashes with security forces, according to figures released by the National Commission on Human Rights. Museveni, 79, who has ruled the East African nation with an iron fist for nearly four decades, said in a televised address on Saturday that the anti-corruption march will not be allowed. \u201cWhat right\u2026 do you have to seek to generate chaotic behavior? \u2026 We are busy producing \u2026 cheap food, other people in other parts of the world are starving\u2026 you here want to disturb us. You are playing with fire because we cannot allow you to disturb us\u2026\u201d, Museveni said in the three-hour-long wide-ranging address. Many young Ugandans say on social media they plan to go ahead with the march to the country\u2019s parliament despite the country\u2019s police refusing to grant a permit for the protest. The Uganda Police Force described the planned protests as \u201cpotentially anarchic\u201d in a statement on Monday, warning it \u201cshall not tolerate disorderly conduct.\u201d Some defiant youth protesters who plan to join the march on Tuesday have begun sharing their photos on social media, urging fellow citizens to remember them if they don\u2019t make it home alive. \u201cJust in case I get abducted or I die in the march, you can use this (photo) for creating awareness. Otherwise, tell mum I played a fundamental role in saving my country! I know she will be happy!\u201d, said one activist Ashiraf Hector on X. Another wrote: \u201cTomorrow, very early in the morning, I will join my fellow young people as we march to parliament against escalating corruption in Uganda. We will come face to face with murderers and in case things go south for me, this is my official portrait.\u201d A group of lawyers and activists said in a letter on Sunday that the police could not, by law, stop peaceful protests. \u201cThe police cannot prohibit a demonstration from proceeding but have powers to regulate it to ensure it takes place within confines of the law,\u201d the letter said while urging President Museveni to \u201censure that the constitutional right to assemble, demonstrate peacefully \u2026 is not violated with impunity by security agencies.\u201d Crackdown ahead of protests Ugandan opposition leader Bobi Wine\u00a0said on Monday he supported the protest which he clarified was \u201corganized by the young people of Uganda\u201d and not his NUP party. Wine raised the alarm that his party\u2019s secretariat had been cordoned off by security forces and some party leaders had been \u201cviolently arrested\u201d ahead of the Tuesday march. \u201cThe effort by the regime to clamp down and make it (the planned protest) look like\u00a0an NUP\u00a0initiative is meant to weaken it because they want to make it appear like a partisan matter,\u201d he said in a statement on X. Uganda grapples with widespread government corruption with an estimated Sh. 10 trillion\u00a0($2.7 billion) in public\u00a0funding\u00a0diverted\u00a0each year, according to its anti-graft body, the Inspectorate of Government (IGG). Last year, it scored 26 on Transparency International\u2019s Corruption Perceptions Index which ranks countries on a scale of zero to 100, with zero meaning \u201chighly corrupt\u201d and 100 signifying that a country is \u201cvery clean.\u201d \u201cThe thieves are parasites that must be stamped out,\u201d Museveni said about his administration\u2019s fight against graft last month, adding that his ruling NRM party \u201cdoes not victimize anybody without proof (of corruption).\u201d \u201cThat is why some people think that the NRM is soft on corruption,\u201d he said, stating that some corruption cases against public officials were being decided in court. However, those agitating for a protest are unimpressed with the government\u2019s handling of corruption, urging Ugandans to \u201c#March2Parliament\u201d on July 23 to \u201c#StopCorruption.\u201d\u2019. Some have also called for the\u00a0speaker of\u00a0the\u00a0parliament, Anita Annet Among, to resign. She was among high-profile Ugandan politicians\u00a0sanctioned by the United States and the United Kingdom for corruption earlier this year. \u201cAmong is designated due to involvement in significant corruption tied to her leadership of Uganda\u2019s Parliament,\u201d according to the US State Department. \ufeffAmong has pushed back against the sanctions, calling them \u201cpolitically motivated\u201d and claiming they were triggered by Uganda\u2019s defiance of international pressure after passing a strict anti-LGBTQ law last year.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/22/africa/uganda-anti-corruption-protest-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_15_africa_gambia-upholds-fgm-ban-intl", "text": "Gambia\u2019s parliament has voted to uphold a landmark law that bans female genital mutilation (FGM) in the largely Muslim nation, after religious groups pushed for the legislation to be repealed. If Monday\u2019s bid had been successful, the tiny West African country would have been the first in the world to relegalize FGM after criminalizing it. MP Amadou Camara, who chairs a joint health and gender committee that recommended that FGM should remain outlawed, told CNN that none of the clauses seeking the repeal of the ban in the Women\u2019s (Amendment) Bill 2024 was passed. Parliament Speaker Fabakary Jatta\u00a0ruled that it was \u201cimpossible\u201d for the bill, which passed a second reading four months ago, to be read a third time and to pass without those clauses. \u201cI so rule that the bill is rejected, and the legislative process exhausted,\u201d Jatta said at plenary meeting Monday. FGM was prohibited in Gambia in 2015 by former president Yahya Jammeh who authorized the\u00a0imposition of fines and prison sentences\u00a0of up to three years for individuals who engaged in it. The law also punished perpetrators with life sentences in cases where the practice led to death. Pro-Islamic groups and lawmakers pushed back against the criminalization, saying that female circumcision was \u201cone of the virtues of Islam.\u201d Other prominent Gambians, such as opposition leader and former interior minister Mai Ahmad Fatty also defended the practice, arguing that: \u201cThere is no FGM in Gambia. We circumcise, not mutilate.\u201d Human rights organization Amnesty International earlier described efforts to revoke the FGM ban as a \u201cbackward move\u201d for the protection of human rights in the country. In Gambia, 73% of women aged between 15 and 49 years had experienced FGM as of 2020, according to the United Nations. More than 65% of those women were subjected to the practice \u201cbefore the age of five years,\u201d the UN said. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Women\u2019s Day in March that he was \u201coutraged\u201d by moves by Gambia\u2019s parliament to legalize FGM, describing the practice as \u201chorrific.\u201d Despite the ban, FGM has still been performed on children in parts of the country. Last year, three women were convicted of performing the practice on eight female minors\u00a0and ordered to pay fines of around 15,000 Gambian Dalasi ($220) each or face a one-year jail sentence. The penalties were\u00a0reported\u00a0to have been paid by an Islamic cleric.

{"id": "2024_07_19_style_skywalkers-rooftopping-documentary-culture-queue", "text": "What was your most thrilling first date? In 2016, two young Russians known for their extreme \u201crooftopping\u201d adventures \u2014 where they attempt to illegally climb vertiginous landmarks like La Sagrada Familia and the Eiffel Tower \u2014 skipped the perfunctory happy hour cocktail and instead ascended China\u2019s tallest incomplete skyscraper, the 1,957-foot-high Goldin Finance 117. At the time, Ivan Beerkus and Angela Nikolau didn\u2019t know they\u2019d end up together. Beerkus had invited Nikolau, a rare female member of the rooftopping community (she was scaling the proverbial glass wall before breaking it), to join him for the climb to produce sponsored social media posts. But it was the beginning of a long romantic and creative partnership, which has led them to travel thousands of miles\u00a0\u2014 and thousands of feet in the air \u2014 together. Eight years later, the documentary film \u201cSkywalkers: A Love Story\u201d takes an intimate look at their unusual romance through hundreds of hours of footage that, of course, includes heart-dropping POV footage from impossible heights and the occasional run-in with law enforcement. Like all couples, Beerkus and Nikolau have their ups and downs, and when they argue the stakes are a just bit higher than most (in one scene, Beerkus\u00a0bravely accuses his girlfriend of being \u201ctoo negative\u201d as she gears up to nail a precarious acrobatic pose literally above the clouds). Through the pair\u2019s unusual lifestyles, \u201cSkywalkers\u201d becomes a meditation on trust and commitment, though their stunts will also get your palms sweaty, if that\u2019s your thing. Directed by Jeff Zimbalist, a filmmaker with rooftopping experience of his own, and co-directed by Maria Bukhonina, \u201dSkywalkers\u201d debuted at Sundance Film Festival in January and is now streaming on Netflix. It follows the couple, who utilize Nikolau\u2019s background as a trained gymnast to create acrobatic stunts on narrow ledges, poles and scaffolding, as they take on increasingly difficult challenges and navigate their own budding relationship. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about the fear of falling from heights, but more about the fear of falling in love,\u201d Zimbalist said in a video call with CNN. \u201cAngela first told me that they were\u2026 competitors and rivals. But you could sense under the surface that there was this bubbling flirtation there.\u201d An architectural dare As the documentary progresses, the pair plot out their most difficult climb yet: Kuala Lumpur\u2019s Merdeka 118, the world\u2019s second-tallest building. The gleaming 2,227-foot-tall tower, which opened earlier this year, is crowned with a 527-foot-tall spire whose apex is only accessible via a narrow internal ladder. In 2022, when Beerkus and Nikolau made their plans, the \u201csupertall\u201d skyscraper had topped out but was still under construction. Evading security and reaching its apogee safely required an intense and elaborate scheme \u2014 one conjured while they worked through relationship issues. (At the time of their climb, the tower\u2019s owner said police were investigating the pair for trespassing, although Malaysian authorities did not respond to CNN about whether further legal action was taken.) Rooftopping is a contentious pastime \u2014 both for the danger it poses and participants\u2019 reliance on illegal trespassing.  With the urban \u201csport\u201d emerging as one more of the more extreme ways to get likes on social media, several harrowing deaths have followed. For \u201cSkywalkers\u201d the film crew followed Beerkus and Nikolau to document their stunts, but only to a point. Zimbalist emphasized his team\u2019s safety measures, which were designed to ensure the crew neither endangered themselves nor presented any distractions for the couple. \u201cWe talked a lot with Ivan and Angela, saying, \u2018Please, don\u2019t go do anything additionally crazy beyond what you would usually do,\u2019\u201d Zimbalist said. \u201cBecause to us, this isn\u2019t a movie about whether or not you succeed at Merdeka or any other climb\u2026 the genuine suspense here is if you choose to trust each other.\u201d An \u2018expanded state of mind\u2019 For the couple, rooftopping isn\u2019t just about thrill-seeking. Nikolau, the daughter of circus performers, says in the film that pushing herself to her limits was engrained from childhood and that she is always striving to better herself. For Beerkus, who scaled buildings alone in Moscow for years, rooftopping offers a sense of mental clarity. \u201cThe higher I went, the easier it was to breathe,\u201d he says to camera, recalling his earliest climbs. \u201cThis extreme life, this expanded state of mind, it\u2019s essential for me.\u201d Zimbalist recognizes the dangers of rooftopping and says his film is not\u00a0 about\u00a0\u201cdefending what they do against critics.\u201d Instead, he hope that \u201dSkywalkers,\u201d in addition to its message on love and trust, provides a rare look at the hard work and planning behind the rooftoppers\u2019 \u201cpolished\u201d social media posts. \u201cWith any activity that\u2019s dangerous, social media tends to disguise the difficulty,\u201d he said. \u201cTelling the story behind a stunt helps to give context and just how challenging and how dangerous some of these things are.\u201d Believe it or not, Nikolau maintains that she is afraid of heights, something she has had to confront repeatedly to keep up with her chosen line of work. \u201cThe fear never really went away; I just got better and better at facing it,\u201d she explains in one clip. So while the makers of \u201cSkywalkers\u201d would probably rather you don\u2019t climb your nearest skyscraper, their film encourages us to dare \u2014 and say \u201cyes\u201d to the thing that scares us the most. \u201cSkywalkers: A Love Story\u201d is available to watch on Netflix Add to Queue: Such great heights WATCH: \u201cFree Solo\u201d (2018) If you prefer watching daring feats on rock cliffs instead of skyscrapers, this Academy Award-winning documentary by filmmaker Chai Vasarhelyi and photographer-mountaineer Jimmy Chin follows climber Alex Honnold as he prepares to summit Yosemite\u2019s very vertical 3,000-foot-tall rock formation, El Capitan, without a rope or a harness.

The vote pits the authoritarian Maduro \u2013 who has overseen unprecedented levels of poverty and emigration from the country \u2013\u00a0against Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia \u2013 a quiet, bird-loving grandfather who has built a strong following despite being the opposition\u2019s third choice after its two preferred candidates were barred from running. But experts warn that the result of the vote may well be contested. Maduro has a habit for clinging to power, they point out: his government has long been accused of rigging votes and the 2018 election that returned Maduro to office was described as illegitimate by an alliance of 14 Latin American nations, Canada and the United States. The populist and the former diplomat Maduro, who took the mantle of the populist Chavismo movement after his predecessor Hugo Chavez\u2019s death in 2013, is seeking his third consecutive six-year term in office.\u00a0His last race was largely boycotted by the opposition. The Organization of American States called that vote a \u201cfarce,\u201d noting that it was \u201cheld with a generalized lack of public freedoms, with outlawed candidates and parties and with electoral authorities lacking any credibility, subject to the executive power.\u201d At campaign events this year \u2013\u00a0usually\u00a0rollicking, dance-filled affairs\u00a0\u2013 Maduro has framed his opponents as \u201cfascist\u201d and \u201cmanipulable,\u201d claiming that they would privatize the country\u2019s healthcare and oil industry and \u201cgive away our wealth.\u201d Though under his watch,\u00a0Venezuela\u00a0has seen the rapid collapse of its democracy and nearly eight million of its people flee the country.\u00a0Inflation has soared and food shortages spread as the country\u00a0underwent \u201cthe single largest economic collapse for a non-conflict country in almost half a century,\u201d\u00a0as the International Monetary Fund put it. Gonzalez, a former diplomat, is standing for an opposition coalition known as the Democratic Unitary Platform. His priorities include taming inflation, currently running at 64% year on year, and restoring trust in the country\u2019s institutions of power, like its judiciary, which is currently stacked with Maduro sympathizers. However, he has not given a roadmap on how he would convince an authoritarian government to voluntarily give up control and lead a democratic transition. In recent weeks, his rallies, alongside\u00a0Maria Corina Machado, the charismatic leader of the opposition coalition who was banned from running for president earlier this year (along with her fellow leader Corina Yoris), have drawn staggering crowd sizes, including parts of the population long devoted to Chavismo.\u00a0The pair have promised to build a country that can welcome home the millions of Venezuelans who have left in droves in recent years out of economic desperation. Several other candidates are also running, but they have minimal support and are viewed by the main opposition as government allies. According to Oswaldo Ram\u00edrez, the managing director of ORC Consultores, the opposition has found support in \u201cnearly every corner of the country.\u201d \u201cThe electoral energy is back in the streets of Venezuela,\u201d he said. \u201cNever in the years since this political era began has the opposition had a voting intention that favored it in such a broad way.\u201d Will the election be fair? Twenty-five years after Ch\u00e1vez brought his socialist vision to the halls of power in Caracas, the election marks a rare opportunity for Venezuelans to remake the country \u2013 if Maduro is willing to relinquish control in a defeat. But analysts point to Maduro\u2019s history of alleged election meddling in suggesting he is unlikely to go down quietly. \u201cThis could be the last best shot for Venezuela for a long time to restore democracy,\u201d said Ryan Berg, director of the Americas Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cThe level of fraud that (the Maduro government) is going to necessitate is going to be so obvious to all that there\u2019s no way they can move forward credibly with the election. They\u2019re going to be caught with their hand in the cookie jar.\u201d The ruling party has already been interfering with the election for months. In January, Machado was\u00a0barred from holding public office\u00a0for 15 years by the Maduro-controlled Supreme Court.\u00a0The US said the decision\u00a0flew in the face of a\u00a02023\u00a0pledge the Venezuelan government had made\u00a0to hold free and fair elections.\u00a0Gonzalez was made the candidate after Machado\u2019s\u00a0designated replacement Yoris was similarly blocked from running. Maduro\u2019s government has meanwhile claimed to have thwarted a string of dubious opposition-backed plots to\u00a0sabotage public infrastructure\u00a0and interfere with the election.\u00a0Analysts see those as the seeds of a pretext that Maduro could use to postpone or cancel the election at the last minute. Experts\u00a0warn Maduro could\u00a0also\u00a0move to provoke a military crisis with neighboring Guyana after he and his supporters scaled up their threats to annex an oil-rich piece of that country\u2019s land. Some have speculated that Maduro could use the crisis as an excuse to suspend the election. Maduro\u2019s government has also been accused of trying to sow confusion ahead of election day, including by\u00a0renaming some 6,000 schools, places that typically serve as polling stations. The government has also created significant impediments for the Venezuelans who left the country to vote, including widely unattainable passport and residency requirements, election experts said. How will the vote play out? There are more than 21 million registered voters in Venezuela, including about 17 million people currently living in the country. A limited group of election observers,\u00a0including a team from The Carter Center \u2013 a non-profit organization set up by former US President Jimmy Carter \u2013 will be on the ground to monitor the vote after Venezuelan authorities revoked an invitation in May for the European Union to send a delegation, citing the bloc\u2019s sanctions on the country. But the options for the opposition and the international community are limited if Maduro refuses to cede power, Berg, of CSIS, said.\u00a0\u201cThe opposition can get out in the streets, they can mobilize, they can demand certain things, but if the regime gets in and they have the firepower behind them to repress as we\u2019ve seen in other instances under Maduro, it could get very ugly,\u201d he said. If the opposition does clinch victory, a transition period of six months is likely to include an intense negotiation around amnesty for Maduro and members of his government, which analysts say he is certain to require ahead of any potential handover. Maduro currently faces\u00a0drug trafficking and corruption charges\u00a0in the US and is under investigation for\u00a0crimes against humanity\u00a0by the International Criminal Court. Machado has indicated in recent months\u00a0that the opposition has expressed willingness to the Venezuelan government to establish a \u201cserious negotiation with guarantees\u201d for Maduro and his allies \u2013\u00a0should Maduro and his ruling Socialist United Party of Venezuela step aside in the face of defeat. \u201cWe know the responsibility we have with history, and if there are feelings that animate this process, it is about reunification, coexistence, and justice, never about revenge and persecution,\u201d Machado said earlier this month.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/21/americas/venezuela-presidential-election-explainer-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "world"}}

He is president and design director of architecture and engineering firm NORR, which is behind some of the city\u2019s best-known landmarks, including the Atlantis and Shangri-La Hotels. Now he is working on one of his most ambitious creations. Due for completion by the end of 2024, Ciel Dubai Marina, formerly known as Ciel Tower, will have more than 1,000 rooms and suites spread over 82 floors \u2014 and at around 1,200 feet (365 meters) high, it is set to become the world\u2019s tallest hotel. A passion project For the project, Jan was tasked with designing the skyscraper on a triangular plot of land at Dubai Marina with an area of just 2,500 square meters \u2013 small for a building of that height. \u201cIt\u2019s a property that\u2019s very compressed,\u201d he told CNN in 2021. \u201cIt\u2019s like what you would face in Manhattan or London. The constraints were tremendous, and yet we had to make it work.\u201d A glass observation deck will offer 360-degree views of the city, as well as the coastline and iconic landmarks such as the Palm Jumeirah man-made island, according to the developer, The First Group. Visitors will also be able to take in the sights from a rooftop swimming pool and restaurants. As well as appealing to the senses, the project is energy efficient, using 25% less power for air conditioning than is typical for similar buildings, Jan said. \u201cThis project is not just about architecture. It\u2019s about architecture and engineering coming together,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s why I love the project so much. It \u2026 is my passion, the convergence of science and art.\u201d Throughout the build, Jan said he has been \u201cextremely involved\u201d in the work. \u201cWhen you design a project as complex as the Ciel, you can never let your guard down, you can never say it\u2019s over,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a continuous process.\u201d An extended stay When Jan first arrived in Dubai in 1996, he never envisioned he would leave such a legacy, designing some of the city\u2019s most iconic office developments, residential towers and malls. He grew up in Karachi, Pakistan, and moved to the US aged 18 on a scholarship. After studying structural engineering at Princeton, he got a Master\u2019s in architecture. After that, Jan worked in the US for nine years and had no intention of leaving until he received a job offer as a senior designer working on the Emirates Towers office and hotel complex. Now aged 61, he said that he never planned to stay in the UAE for so long, now having spent 28 years in Dubai. \u201cI got carried away with the excitement here,\u201d he said. As for Ciel Dubai Marina \u2014 named for the French word for sky \u2014 Jan hopes that it will come to be seen as timeless, like the Empire State Building or the Chrysler Building in New York City. \u201cThe reason I like the fact that it\u2019s called Ciel is because I believe in our own lives the sky is the limit, and that\u2019s the case certainly in my own life,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve had a chance to grow, to do things that I didn\u2019t think I would get a chance to do.

{"id": "2024_07_18_tech_att-cyberattacks-data-privacy-laws", "text": "This week, AT&T notified millions of customers that their data was likely stolen in an April leak that the company disclosed earlier this month. Meanwhile, comprehensive laws that would protect customers from hacks keep struggling to pass, as AT&T and its rivals have fought back against and heavily influenced a patchwork of data laws \u2013 arguing the approach has failed to rein in the problem. AT&T customers\u2019 pilfered information was so valuable to cybercriminals that the FBI asked the company to delay filing a disclosure with the Securities and Exchange Commission because of potential national security and public safety concerns. The data was breached from \u201cnearly all\u201d of AT&T\u2019s cellular customers and the customers of wireless providers that used its network between May 1, 2022, and October 31, 2022. It\u2019s not the first time \u2013 even this year \u2013 that AT&T has been breached. The company was already grappling with an unrelated data leak that took place in March. At that time, AT&T said personal information, such as Social Security numbers on 73 million current and former customers, was released onto the dark web. Consumer advocates and some lawmakers have long argued for more protection of customer data. Though state laws have passed across almost 20 states, \u00a0the patchwork of regulations across states and agencies that regulates data privacy, can lead to inconsistencies, contradictions and lacunae. Complicating things further, lobbies from Big Tech to phone carriers have been heavily influencing many of these state and local regulation efforts. In a statement, AT&T said, \u201cWe have long supported a comprehensive federal privacy policy protecting all Americans that applies across the internet ecosystem. We continue to believe that a federal privacy policy should establish a consistent set of protections, enforced by a single regulator, for all consumers.\u201d Lobbies are at the \u2018crux of the problem\u2019 Keepers of private information like who you texted, what you\u2019re watching \u2013 in addition to your address and Social Security number \u2013 makes telecom companies\u2019 data a high-value target. \u00a0That could be invaluable data for phishing and targeted scam attempts. The data phone carriers hold is \u201cthe gateway into everything else on the internet,\u201d Dominic Sellitto, a cyber security professor at University at Buffalo, said. \u201cEvery communication that we have, everything goes through a telecom provider or internet service provider.\u201d And that wealth of data draws hackers. \u201cThese larger companies, because of their size and the treasure trove of data, certainly have a target on their backs,\u201d Sellitto noted. They\u2019re not alone: In just the past year, large cyberattacks have frozen car dealerships and delayed ambulances. Currently, data privacy laws exist in 19 states covering at least 150 million Americans, though differing in scale and scope. There are federal regulations on specific areas of privacy, like laws covering medical data or information about children, and agencies like the FCC regulate telecommunications. But there is no large, comprehensive data privacy law at the federal level, and many state laws are basically written by industries through their lobbyists, said Alan Butler, executive director and president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. \u201cThe crux of the problem in legislating telecoms is the lobbyists and their effectiveness over many, many decades,\u201d said Eric Noonan, CEO of cybersecurity provider CyberSheath. Cybersecurity and data privacy go hand in hand. The heaviest proposed regulation would impose data minimization rules \u2014 meaning if companies collected less data, there would be less available for hackers to steal in the first place. There would also be stricter data security and notification rules if a hack does happen. It\u2019s unclear whether those rules would have prevented AT&T\u2019s hacks or better protected their customers. But consumer advocates have lambasted the telecom industry for getting in the way of more comprehensive laws. Trade groups stressed that realistic privacy laws have had success passing through many states. \u201cIn the absence of workable federal data privacy legislation, our multi-sector coalition is proud to have been one of many stakeholders that have worked on a comprehensive privacy framework that now covers well over 100 million Americans and has received overwhelming bipartisan support across state legislatures with dramatically different political dynamics,\u201d Andrew Kingman, counsel to the State Privacy and Security Coalition said in a statement. Industry trade groups say that while cyber security and data privacy can be interrelated, there is tension between those concepts that might not be fully covered in a data privacy law. What it\u2019s like trying to pass data privacy laws When Collin Walke, a data privacy and cybersecurity attorney, was in the Oklahoma House, he focused on data privacy legislation. After California passed its landmark data privacy law in 2018, he attempted to get similar legislation passed in his state. \u201cWe had lobbyists from Amazon. We had lobbyists from Google. We had all of that. But the number one impediment to us getting it passed in Oklahoma was AT&T and Verizon,\u201d Walke said to CNN. Verizon declined to comment. In a statement, Amazon said it supports \u201cU.S. federal privacy legislation that requires transparency, access to one\u2019s own personal information, and the ability to delete personal information, and prohibits the sale of personal data without consent. In the absence of congressional action, we support well-crafted state laws that protect consumers\u2019 privacy, while continuing to allow for innovation.\u201d Monica Priestley, a state representative in Vermont, said lobbyists from across industries \u201ccame out in full force at the last minute,\u201d even hosting webinars and calls at the town or city level, against a landmark privacy bill this year. One lobby, the State Privacy & Security Coalition, represents AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon, Meta, as well as automobile, healthcare and payment card companies. The Vermont governor vetoed the bill in June, which would have been one of the strongest in the country. Industry trade groups said that the ability to sue companies for data violations and strict data minimization requirements would have been too costly for Vermont small businesses to comply to. \u201cThe hardest part about these bills is they are so technical in nature, and the industry tends to hand the state a policy and encourage them to run with that,\u201d Priestley said. \u201cIndustries created this monster that is out of control, and they themselves are at risk. And something\u2019s got to change.\u201d Why doesn\u2019t a national privacy law exist? Advocates say Big Tech lobbies and telecommunications lobbies have shifted their focus from squashing the federal conversation to getting deeply involved at the state level. \u201cA national law puts everyone on a level playing field,\u201d Noonan said. \u201cIt establishes the baseline of what good looks like for these critical infrastructure providers, including telecommunications companies, and then it gives the government a standard to enforce.\u201d Advocates for a sweeping law say the average consumer shouldn\u2019t have to parse dense user agreements to find out what is going on with their data. In a statement, AT&T said, \u201cOur customers can manage how we use and share their information for certain activities including advertising and marketing, and can opt out at any time.\u201d But tighter regulations mean companies must spend more resources beefing up their cybersecurity. Companies also lobby against allowing individuals to sue for damages. A lot of a telecommunication company\u2019s business is rooted in the data brokerage market, multiple privacy experts told CNN. And it\u2019s valuable data. \u201cLike many other industries, the telecommunications industry sees the commercialization of data for advertising uses as an additional revenue source,\u201d Butler said. In April, the FCC fined AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon nearly $200 million for illegally sharing customers\u2019 personal data without their consent. The fines stem from allegations in 2020 by the Federal Communications Commission that for years, the companies had improperly shared users\u2019 geolocation histories to third parties, including to prisons, as part of their commercial programs. In response to the FCC fines, all of the wireless carriers said they expect to appeal the decision. The FCC is also not the only regulator for telecom companies, which can be giant entities. \u201cIt\u2019s a very opaque space that is begging for clarity, and that clarity can only come through regulation,\u201d Noonan said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/18/tech/att-cyberattacks-data-privacy-laws/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "world"}}

Parts of Kerala are among those most at risk globally for outbreaks of the virus, a\u00a0Reuters investigation\u00a0showed last year. Nipah, which comes from fruit bats and animals such as pigs, can cause a lethal, brain-swelling fever in humans. Nipah is classified as a priority pathogen by the\u00a0World Health Organization (WHO) because of its potential to trigger an epidemic. There is no vaccine to prevent infection and no treatment to cure it. \u201cThe infected boy died on Sunday after a cardiac arrest,\u201d Veena George, the state health minister told local TV reporters, speaking in the Malayalam language. Earlier, in a statement on Saturday, she said as part of Nipah control, the government has issued orders to set up 25 committees to identify and isolate affected people. Dr. Anoop Kumar, director of critical care medicine at Aster MIMS Hospital in Calicut, said one positive case of Nipah had been diagnosed in a school boy and people who had been in contact with him were being watched. \u201cThere is a minimum chance of an outbreak of Nipah virus at this stage,\u201d he said, adding that the situation would be monitored for the next seven to 10 days. There are 214 people on the primary contact list of the boy, the statement said. Among them, 60 are in the high-risk category, it said, and isolation wards have been set up at health institutions to treat patients. Family members of the affected patient were kept at a local hospital for observation, after a case of Nipah virus was confirmed in Malappuram, a town about 350 kilometers (about 220 miles) from Kerala\u2019s capital Thiruvananthapuram, local media reports said. Other people who might be at risk were asked to isolate at home. The state government said it is working to trace any affected people to contain the spread of the virus. Nipah has been linked to the deaths of dozens of people in\u00a0Kerala\u00a0since its first appearance in the state in 2018.

Evacuation orders were issued around 10 p.m. for \u201ceveryone\u201d in Jasper and Jasper National Park, according to the province\u2019s emergency alert system. On Tuesday evening, the park said on Facebook the evacuation of the town was complete. Authorities were still trying to evacuate backcountry hikers, the post added. At least two fires are burning in Jasper National Park, which was closed Tuesday. Jasper National Park is one of Canada\u2019s most popular parks and drew in nearly 2.5 million visitors last year, according to Parks Canada. The city has a population of around 4,100 and there were an estimated 10,000 people, including seasonal workers, in Jasper and 15,000 park visitors when the evacuation was ordered, Stephen Lacroix with the Alberta Emergency Management Agency told The Associated Press. Police officers were going to each residence to enforce the order to leave, Lacroix said. One fire was 6,750 hectares (16,679 acres) while the other fire was 270 hectares (667 acres), according the park\u2019s Facebook post. \u201cAt this time, returning to Jasper is not possible,\u201d park officials said on Facebook, responding to people inquiring about going back for their belongings. \u201cThe Town of Jasper and Jasper National Park remain closed, and it is crucial to comply with the evacuation order.\u201d Evacuees had fled in darkness Monday with little time to prepare. The early stages of the evacuation were complicated by the location of the fires, which forced most of the traffic west toward British Columbia on the region\u2019s Highway 16. By the earliest hours of Tuesday morning, some traffic was allowed to travel east. \u201cOnly when roadside fire conditions permit, small groups of escorted vehicles will be directed east on Highway 16,\u201d an emergency alert stated. Officials in neighboring British Columbia mobilized quickly to support evacuees. \u201cBC communities large and small along (evacuation) routes are doing what we can to get gas stations open, direct folks to rest areas, open welcome centres, and provide support,\u201d Bowinn Ma, British Columbia Minister of Emergency Management and Climate Readiness, posted on social media early Tuesday morning. The wildfires are some of the at least 170 fires burning in Alberta province amid worsening fire activity in recent days. Canada raised the country\u2019s national preparedness level for wildfires to the highest level last Monday. This means the \u201cpotential for emerging significant wildland fires is high to extreme,\u201d according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. Firefighters were hoping Tuesday for downpours in the Jasper evacuation zone as any wet weather could help control fire spread. But forecasters also said there would be breezy conditions \u2013 which might cause fire behavior to become erratic at times. Wednesday will be largely dry and breezy in the area before widespread showers arrive Thursday morning and steady rain arrives by the evening. Depending on exactly how the fires behave early this week, fire crews may be able to make notable containment progress Thursday. Wildfires have burned more than 5 million acres in Canada this year, which is right around average for late July. Despite millions of acres burned, this year\u2019s fire season is pacing well below last year\u2019s record-breaking, devastating season.

The announcement followed reconciliation talks hosted by China involving 14 Palestinian factions starting Sunday, according to China\u2019s Foreign Ministry, which come as Israel wages war against militant group Hamas in Gaza and as Beijing has sought to present itself as a potential peace broker in the conflict. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said the agreement was \u201cdedicated to the great reconciliation and unity of all 14 factions.\u201d \u201cThe core outcome is that the PLO (Palestine Liberation Organization)\u00a0is the sole legitimate representative of all Palestinian people,\u201d Wang said, adding that \u201can agreement has been reached on post-Gaza war governance and the establishment of a provisional national reconciliation government.\u201d It was unclear from Wang\u2019s comments what role Hamas, which is not part of the PLO, would play in such an arrangement, or what the immediate impact of any deal would be. The talks were held as the future governance of Palestinian territories remains in question following Israel\u2019s repeated vow to eradicate Hamas in response to the group\u2019s\u00a0October 7 terrorist attack on its territory. The PLO is a coalition of parties that signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1993, and formed a new government in the Palestinian Authority (PA). Fatah dominates both the PLO and the PA, the interim Palestinian government that was established in the Israeli-occupied West Bank after the 1993 agreement known as the Oslo Accords was signed.\u00a0Hamas was not party to the accords and does not recognize Israel. Mustafa Barghouti, president of the Palestinian National Initiative, who was at the Beijing talks, said \u201call the parties\u201d have agreed that they should join the PLO, and that the organization is the only legitimate representative of the Palestinians. There is a long history of bitter enmity between Hamas and Fatah.\u00a0The two sides have tried \u2013 and failed \u2013 multiple times to reach an agreement to unite the two separate Palestinian territories under one governance structure, with a 2017 agreement quickly folding in violence. The PA held administrative control over Gaza until 2007, after Hamas won the 2006 legislative elections in the occupied territories and expelled it from the strip. Since then, Hamas has ruled Gaza and the PA governs parts of the West Bank. Hamas and Fatah\u00a0signed a\u00a0reconciliation agreement\u00a0in Cairo in October 2017 under pressure from the Arab states, led by Egypt. Under the deal, a new unity government was supposed to take administrative control of Gaza two months later, ending a decade of rivalry that began when Hamas violently evicted the Palestinian Authority from Gaza in 2007. But the deal\u2019s lofty aspirations quickly collapsed. When Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah visited Gaza in March 2018, he was the target of an\u00a0assassination attempt\u00a0when a bomb detonated near his convoy. Hamdallah\u2019s Fatah party immediately blamed Hamas for the attack. A common front against occupation Barghouti said the latest attempt at reconciling the Palestinian factions \u201cwent much further\u201d than previous efforts and included \u201cspecific steps\u201d towards the formation of a consensus government. The war in Gaza, he told CNN, has prodded the factions to unite as a common front against Israel\u2019s occupation. \u201cThere was a very clear feeling that what Israel is doing is really threatening everybody,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so, in that sense, the feeling of unity (to) confront the Israeli side is very clear here.\u201d A new government would ensure the unity of the occupied West Bank and Gaza, ruling both territories after the war and effectively \u201cblocking Israeli efforts\u201d to maintain its occupation of Gaza, he said. Most Palestinians would however be taking the news about reconciliation \u201cwith the usual caution and pessimism,\u201d said Tahani Mustafa, senior Palestine analyst at the International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based think tank. \u201cThe major issues that have proven to be obstacles to reconciliation in the past were not addressed,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s very unlikely anything substantial will come out of this especially as the biggest obstacle so far has been (Palestinian Authority president and Fatah leader) Mahmoud Abbas (and) his absolute reluctance to relinquish in any way his monopoly on power.\u201d Hamas is not opposed to the PLO but has instead demanded fair representation within the organization, she said. \u201cAbbas has been reluctant to provide this, as it would mean Fatah losing its hegemony over the last Palestinian political institution it controls.\u201d At a news conference Tuesday in Beijing, Hamas delegation representative Mousa Abu Marzook said they had reached an agreement to complete a \u201ccourse of reconciliation,\u201d while also using the platform in Beijing to defend the group\u2019s October 7 attack on Israel. \u201cWe\u2019re at a historic junction. Our people are rising up in their efforts to struggle,\u201d\u00a0Abu Marzook said,\u00a0according to a translation provided by China\u2019s Foreign Ministry, adding that the October 7 operation\u00a0had \u201cchanged a lot, both in international and regional landscape.\u201d Hossam Badran, a member of Hamas\u2019 Political Bureau, said that during the meeting a step toward forming a consensus government was agreed in principle, \u201cwith the approval of the Palestinian factions, to manage the affairs of the Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank, supervise reconstruction, and also prepare the atmosphere for elections at a later stage.\u201d Badran said this initiative should not wait until after the war, but should proceed even as the conflict continues and that establishing such a government could facilitate a ceasefire. He added that in \u201cthis meeting, we talked about the mechanisms, but a one or two-day meeting does not allow us to discuss all the details.\u201d Beijing has not explicitly condemned Hamas for its October 7 attack on Israel. China\u2019s role Tuesday\u2019s agreement follows an earlier round of talks between Hamas and Fatah hosted by Beijing in April. Since the start of the war in Gaza, China \u2013 which has looked to bolster its influence and ties in the Middle East in recent years \u2013 has presented itself as a leading voice for countries across the Global South decrying Israel\u2019s war in the enclave and calling for Palestinian statehood. Chinese leader Xi Jinping in May called for an international peace conference during meetings with leaders from Arab nations and has also dispatched a special envoy to the Middle East to meet with diplomats and officials. Observers have questioned the extent of Beijing\u2019s geopolitical clout in a region where the US has long been a dominant power, but China surprised many last March when it played a role brokering a rapprochement between longtime rivals Saudi Arabia and Iran. Those efforts have been broadly seen as part of Beijing\u2019s push to position itself as a geopolitical heavyweight with a different vision for the world from the United States. The US State Department said that while it had not reviewed the text of the Beijing agreement, it did not support Hamas having a role in the postwar governance of Gaza. \u201cWhen it comes to governance of Gaza at the end of the conflict, there can\u2019t be a role for a terrorist organization,\u201d State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told a press briefing, referring to Hamas specifically. Miller said he did not believe the deal would \u201cin any way have an impact on the ongoing discussions to reach a ceasefire.\u201d Miller also said the US wants to see a the Palestinian Authority governing \u201ca unified Gaza and the West Bank\u201d after the war. \u201cBut no, we do not support a role for Hamas,\u201d said Miller, adding that Hamas has \u201cthe blood of innocent civilians, both Israeli and Palestinian, on their hands.\u201d Miller would not say whether or not US Secretary of State Antony Blinken would speak about the deal specifically in his upcoming meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi. Tuesday\u2019s agreement was inked as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is in the US for a highly\u00a0anticipated visit in which he will meet top US officials and address Congress. Israel launched its military operations in Gaza following Hamas\u2019 October 7 attack that killed more than 1,100 people and\u00a0saw roughly\u00a0250 others kidnapped. Around 39,000 Palestinians have died in the conflict, which that has triggered a mass humanitarian crisis\u00a0and widespread destruction.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/23/china/hamas-fatah-palestinian-factions-beijing-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "world"}}

The fishing vessel, FV Argos Georgia, requested assistance soon after it began sinking east of the islands at about 4 p.m. local time Monday, the Falkland Islands government said in press release Tuesday. The crew abandoned ship and some managed to board life rafts, the government said. Some of those who boarded the life rafts have since been rescued, but a search is continuing for those still missing, the statement said. CNN has reached out to the Falkland Islands government to clarify the number of dead and missing. \u201cThis is a developing situation, and we will provide no further comment,\u201d Sally Heathman, head of communications for the Falkland Islands Government, told CNN on Tuesday. Citing British and Spanish maritime authorities, the Associated Press reported that 14 people had made it onto a life raft and were rescued by nearby fishing boats. It said at least six people had died and seven remained missing. At least 10 of the crew members were identified as Spaniards, the AP reported. Those who have been rescued will be taken to the King Edward VII Memorial Hospital in the capital Stanley for medical assessments, according to the Falkland Islands government. A search and rescue operation involving helicopters and vessels began on Monday and will continue throughout the night on Tuesday. The Falkland Islands said that a search and rescue helicopter had unsuccessfully attempted to rescue crew members on Monday evening but was thwarted due to \u201cextremely challenging weather conditions and very limited time on scene due to range.\u201d \u201cThe helicopter returned to Stanley Airport to refuel prior to a second attempt but the weather worsened further, and rotary wing SAR operations were suspended,\u201d it added. In addition to the Falkland Islands government, the search and rescue operation involves the government of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, HQ British Forces South Atlantic Islands, the UK Maritime & Coastguard Agency, the management company of the fishing vessel, and other fishing vessels at sea. \u201cThe Falkland Islands government sends their thoughts to all the families involved,\u201d it added. Argentina\u2019s Navy said it had also attempted search and rescue operations after being alerted about the ship\u2019s sinking.

{"id": "2024_07_22_middleeast_west-bank-attacks-qusra-intl", "text": "Masked Israeli settlers attacked a group of Palestinian farmers and foreign activists accompanying them for protection in the West Bank town of Qusra on Sunday, according to victims of the attack and videos obtained by CNN. Eight activists were participating as part of a Palestinian grassroots campaign called Defend Palestine, which calls on international volunteers to travel to the Israeli-occupied West Bank to protect Palestinians from Israeli settler attacks. Two Americans and a German national were taken to hospital with suspected fractures after the attack, their campaign said, adding that another American volunteer suffered minor injuries. One of the Palestinian farmers was hospitalized. Three of the foreign victims, Vivi Chen, David Hummel, and Jedda, who declined to give her last name, spoke with CNN about the attack from hospital in the West Bank city of Nablus, where they were receiving treatment. They said they were accompanying Palestinian farmers to their olive fields, which they haven\u2019t been able to access since October because of attacks by Israeli settlers. At some point, the group was approached by several young settlers on a hill. \u201cThey sort of stood there for a while and then they came up to our group of international volunteers and they started hitting us with these thick wooden sticks almost like baseball bats,\u201d Chen said. Videos recorded by the activists show them trying to retreat as they were attacked. One of them immediately falls to the ground, another tries to shield himself with his arms as he is struck, and at least one is kicked in the leg and hit with a rock hurled by an attacker. One woman fell down the hill and was also struck with a rock. The settlers then \u201csmashed her phone and she lost her documents and cards,\u201d Chen told CNN. \u201cWe were doing nothing,\u201d the Hummel said. \u201cOur hands were up and we were backing up and trying to protect each other. So eventually, we tried to keep moving back because we had been hit so many times.\u201d Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan in the 1967 war and soon started settling Jews on the land. There are currently more than 700,000 Jewish settlers in the West Bank. The international community however considers the area to be occupied and Israeli settlements there illegal. The Palestinians want the territory for a future independent state. The International Court of Justice (ICJ), the United Nations\u2019 top court, said Friday that Israel\u2019s presence in the West Bank and East Jerusalem is illegal, in an unprecedented opinion that called on Israel to end its occupation. It called on Israel to cease new settlement activity, evacuate settlers and make reparations for the damage caused. \u2018Dire need\u2019 for international protection The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) acknowledged the attack on Sunday, saying in a short statement to CNN that \u201ca number of masked Israeli civilians assaulted a group of foreign citizens while they were planting trees in the area.\u201d The IDF said it condemns any acts of violence, adding that its soldiers were sent to the scene and that it will operate to maintain security in what it considers its jurisdiction.\u00a0It added that soldiers were dispatched to the scene and fired warning shots into the air, causing the attackers to flee. But the activists said that when the soldiers arrived, they immediately pointed their guns at a Palestinian man who was accompanying the volunteers and fired shots in his direction. \u201cHe was our friend and everyone was screaming, \u2018No, no! He\u2019s our friend, he\u2019s our friend!\u2019 And they shot live bullets at him,\u201d the activists said. The IDF didn\u2019t respond to CNN\u2019s question about the alleged targeting of the Palestinian volunteer. The injured activists were taken for treatment by the Palestinian Red Crescent to a hospital in Nablus. Pictures taken at the hospital showed the victims with multiple cuts and bruises across their bodies. The face of Hummel, the German activist, was severely swollen on the right side. Mohammed Khatib, an organizer with the Defend Palestine campaign, said: \u201cThe attack today, not even 24 hours after the ICJ ruled that Israeli occupation is illegal and that settlers enjoy impunity when exercising violence, serves as further proof for the dire need for international civil protection in Palestine.\u201d Chen said the group didn\u2019t expect to encounter violence but was \u201caware of settler violence\u201d against Palestinians. \u201cOur injuries are very minor compared to what the Palestinians face every day,\u201d she said. Sunday\u2019s assault followed a separate attack on Saturday in the West Bank, south of Hebron.

{"id": "2024_07_20_middleeast_yemen-israel-strikes-hodeidah-intl", "text": "At least six people were killed and scores more injured in Israeli airstrikes on a Yemeni port, Houthi rebels have said, a day after the Iran-backed group claimed a deadly attack on the Israeli city of Tel Aviv. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its fighter jets struck \u201cmilitary targets of the Houthi terrorist regime\u201d in the area of Yemen\u2019s Hodeidah Port on Saturday, in what Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said was a direct response to the death of a 50-year-old Israeli in a Houthi drone attack on Tel Aviv on Friday. This is the first time Israel has struck Yemen, according to Israeli officials. The Houthis said at least six people were killed, three are missing while a further 83 people were injured in the strikes, which hit oil facilities. Houthi spokesperson Mohammed Abdulsalam said the strikes had also hit civilian targets and a power station. He slammed what he said was \u201cbrutal Israeli aggression\u201d aimed at increasing the \u201csuffering of the people of Yemen\u201d and pressuring the group to stop its support of Gaza. Houthi army spokesperson Yehya Saree vowed to respond to the strike, saying the Houthis would not hesitate to strike Israel\u2019s \u201cvital targets\u201d and warning that Tel Aviv \u2013 a major city home to scores of diplomatic missions \u2013 was still not safe. \u201cWe have prepared for a long war with this enemy until the aggression stops and the blockade on the Palestinian people is lifted,\u201d Saree said. On Sunday Israel said it intercepted a missile launched from Yemen. \u201cThe projectile did not cross into Israeli territory. Rocket and missile sirens were sounded following the possibility of falling shrapnel. The incident has concluded,\u201d the IDF said. \u2018Not an innocent port\u2019 Netanyahu said in a statement on Saturday that Hodeidah was \u201cnot an innocent port.\u201d \u201cIt was used for military purposes, it was used as an entry point for deadly weapons supplied to the Houthis by Iran,\u201d Netanyahu said, adding that Hodeidah had also been used to attack international shipping in the Red Sea. Netanyahu also said the operation, which hit targets 1,800 km (1,118 miles) from Israel\u2019s borders, shows the enemy Israel is serious about responding to threats. \u201cIt makes it clear to our enemies that there is no place that the long arm of the state of Israel will not reach,\u201d Netanyahu said. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a UN statement he was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d by reports of the strikes. \u201cThe response to the Israeli aggression against our country is inevitably coming and will be huge and great,\u201d Houthi rebels warned in a statement following the attack, adding that they will continue their operations against Israeli, American, and British ships until Israel stops its \u201csiege\u201d on Gaza. IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari said the strikes were also in response to the roughly 200 missiles and drones the rebel group has launched towards Israel since October, when Israel\u2019s war with Hamas in Gaza began. Since the start of the war, the Yemeni rebels have regularly targeted the country with drones and missiles, most of which have been intercepted by Israel\u2019s defenses or those of its allies. However, the Houthis have claimed their drone attack in Tel Aviv Friday \u2013 which also injured 10 people \u2013 was performed by a new drone capable of \u201cbypassing the enemy\u2019s interception systems.\u201d The Houthis have also regularly attacked US targets and commercial shipping in the Red Sea. Both the UK and the US have responded to the attacks on shipping by carrying out strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen. However, Israel has not taken part in those responses. An Israeli defense official told CNN that this was a 100% Israeli strike. The official said Israel had previously let the US and UK take the lead on responding to Houthi attacks but decided to respond itself this time because of the death of the Israeli citizen in Tel Aviv. According to the official, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant informed US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin before the strike was carried out. The defense official added that Israel was able to strike so quickly because it had been preparing for this scenario for months. A White House official said US President Joe Biden had been briefed on \u201cdevelopments\u201d in the Middle East. A spokesperson for the White House National Security Council said the US had not coordinated with Israel on the airstrikes, but added that the US fully recognizes \u201cIsrael\u2019s right to self-defense.\u201d Who are the Houthis? The Houthi movement, also known as Ansar Allah \u2013 Arabic for \u2018Supporters of God\u2019 \u2013\u00a0is a Shi\u2019ite Islamist political and military organization backed by Iran, that emerged in the 1990s. Similar to chants used by Lebanon-based Iranian proxy Hezbollah, the Houthis\u2019 official slogan reads, \u201cGod is the Greatest. Death to America. Death to Israel. Curse the Jews. Victory to Islam.\u201d In 2014, Houthi forces allied with former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh took control of Yemen\u2019s capital, Sanaa, from the UN-recognized Yemeni government, sparking a civil war that has afflicted the country ever since. Since March 2015, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have led a coalition in Yemen against Houthi forces. More recently, the group has come to be seen in parts of the largely Sunni Muslim world and beyond as champions of the Palestinian cause, defending the people of Gaza against Israel. Since October 7, Houthi rebels have carried out numerous missile and drone attacks on ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, asserting that these vessels are linked to Israel and its allies, which has escalated tensions throughout the Middle East. Regional tensions rise In recent weeks Hezbollah has been ramping up cross-border attacks with Israel after months of low-intensity fighting, prompting the Israeli military to warn that it is prepared to launch a large-scale attack on its northern border. Following the Hodeidah strike, Israel\u2019s Minister of National Security Itamar Ben Gvir congratulated Netanyahu on the operation and said Israel should \u201cadopt the same policy against Hezbollah in Lebanon.\u201d Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and Defense Minister Gallant echoed Ben Gvir\u2019s sentiment. Smotrich said Israel must continue to attack \u201cwith all its might even in distant places,\u201d while Gallant said \u201cthe blood of Israeli citizens has a price,\u201d and that anywhere Israelis are attacked the \u201cresult will be identical.\u201d \u201cThe fire that is currently burning in Hodeidah, is seen across the Middle East and the significance is clear,\u201d Gallant said. Hezbollah in Lebanon condemned the attack on Yemen and said \u201cwe stand firmly with the Yemeni people in defending themselves, their sovereignty, and their heroic and historic stance alongside Palestine.\u201d Hamas also condemned the attack, calling it a \u201cdangerous escalation.\u201d Meanwhile, Israeli Minister of Foreign Affairs Israel Katz called on the international community to \u201cmaximize sanctions on Iran.\u201d \u201cIran supports, trains, and finances the Houthi terror organization as part of its regional network of terror organizations aimed at attacking Israel,\u201d he said. \u201cIran is the head of the snake \u2013 it must be stopped now,\u201d Katz added. Iran condemned the Israeli strike on Hodeidah. Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Nasser Kanaani warned of the risk of war in the region, saying Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza were the \u201croot\u201d of the escalating tensions. \u201cThe oppressed but powerful people of Yemen are paying the price for their honorable support of the innocent citizens, women and children of Gaza,\u201d Kanaani said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/20/middleeast/yemen-israel-strikes-hodeidah-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "world"}}

Germany hopes Ukraine will be able to meet the bulk of its military needs with the $50 billion in loans from the proceeds of frozen Russian assets approved by the Group of Seven, and that funds earmarked for armaments will not be fully used. \u201cUkraine\u2019s financing is secured for the foreseeable future thanks to European instruments and the G7 loans,\u201d German Finance Minister Christian Lindner said on Wednesday at a news conference. Washington pushed to \u201cfront load\u201d the loans to give Ukraine a big lump sum now. Officials say EU leaders agreed to the idea in part because it reduces the chance of Ukraine being short of funds if Trump returns to the White House. Alarm bells rang across Europe this week after Trump picked Senator JD Vance, who opposes military aid for Ukraine and warned Europe will have to rely less on the United States to defend the continent, as his candidate for vice president. Trump sparked fierce criticism from Western officials for suggesting he would not protect countries that failed to meet the transatlantic military alliance\u2019s defense spending targets and would even encourage Russia to attack them. Germany has faced criticism for repeatedly missing a NATO target of spending 2% of its economic output on defense. Depleted military stocks The stocks of Germany\u2019s armed forces, already run down by decades of underinvestment, have been further depleted by arms supplies to Kyiv. So far, Berlin has donated three Patriot air defense units to Kyiv, more than any other country, bringing down the number of Patriot systems in Germany to nine. Germany\u2019s fractious coalition of left-leaning Social Democrats, pro-business liberals and ecologist Greens has struggled to comply with NATO\u2019s spending target due to self-imposed rules that limit the amount of state borrowing they can take on. Although military aid to Ukraine will be cut, Germany will comply with the NATO target of spending 2% of GDP on defense in 2025, with a total of \u20ac75.3 billion. Days after Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced a \u201cZeitenwende\u201d \u2013 German for historic turning point - with a \u20ac100 billion special fund to bring the military up to speed. From this special fund, there will be \u20ac22.0 billion more for defense, plus \u20ac53.3 billion in the regular budget, still less than that sought by Defense Minister Boris Pistorius. The defense budget is set to receive a meagre \u20ac1.3 billion more than in 2024, far below the \u20ac6.7 billion requested by Pistorius. As ever-increasing annual operating costs outpace this rise, the defense ministry is being forced to cut ammunition orders for 2025 by more than half, reduce procurement by \u20ac260 million and research and development by over \u20ac200 million. The budget for 2025 comes with the mid-term financial planning until 2028, the year when the armed forces\u2019 special fund to meet NATO\u2019s minimum spending goals is due to run out and 80 billion will be needed for defense, as noted in the financial plan. In 2028, there is a gap of \u20ac39 billion in the regular budget, of which \u20ac28 billion are needed to comply with the NATO target without the special fund, sources from the finance ministry said. Decisions on how the hole will be plugged are not likely to be taken until after the 2025 election. \u201cThe 80 billion euros that have been put on display for 2028 simply do not exist,\u201d said Ingo Gaedechens, member of the parliament\u2019s budget committee from the conservative opposition party CDU. \u201cThe coalition is not even trying to cover this up but are openly admitting it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/18/europe/ukraine-germany-aid-halved-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_19_asia_bangladesh-job-quota-protests-explainer-intl-hnk", "text": "Huge protests across Bangladesh escalated into deadly violence this week with clashes\u00a0between students, pro-government supporters\u00a0and armed police fueling\u00a0widespread\u00a0anger over civil service job quotas opponents say are discriminatory. Dozens of people have reportedly been killed and hundreds injured in the violence, which has seen riot police use tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters and crowds of demonstrators armed with sticks filling the streets and university campuses in the capital Dhaka and other cities. State broadcaster Bangladesh Television (BTV) was off air on Friday after student demonstrators allegedly set fire to its headquarters, according to local media, and protesters have called for a nationwide shutdown in a major challenge to the government of longstanding Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. A curfew has been imposed, mobile and internet services cut, schools and universities ordered to close, and security forces deployed to quell the unrest, with human rights groups accusing authorities of using unlawful force against protesters. On Sunday, Bangladesh\u2019s Supreme Court rolled back most of the controversial quotas on government jobs, with officials saying they hope it will bring normalcy back to the streets. Here\u2019s what you need to know. Why are students protesting? Many Bangladeshi students are demanding an end to the government\u2019s quota system, which reserves more than half of\u00a0civil service posts for certain groups. Some 30% of those highly sought-after jobs are reserved for relatives of veterans who fought in Bangladesh\u2019s war of independence from Pakistan in 1971, a seminal moment in the nation\u2019s history as it successfully won freedom from a much larger ruler. Many of the country\u2019s contemporary political elite are related to that generation \u2013 including Prime Minister Hasina, a daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the widely regarded founder of modern Bangladesh who was assassinated in 1975. The reserved roles are linked to\u00a0job security and higher pay, and protesters say the quota system is discriminatory and favors supporters of Hasina\u2019s ruling Awami League party. They are demanding recruitment based on merit. \u201cA government job is a really good opportunity,\u201d said Maruf Khan, 29, a Bangladeshi studying in Australia, who has joined rallies supporting the protests in Sydney. \u201cAbout 500,000 to 600,000 people are competing for 600 to 700 government jobs and on top of that it includes a 56% quota. It\u2019s not easy.\u201d Driving the anger is high unemployment levels in the country, especially among young people. Bangladesh has seen strong economic growth under Hasina, but it has slowed in the post-pandemic era and, as the World Bank notes in its latest overview, inequality has \u201cwidened in urban areas.\u201d\u00a0In a nation of 170 million people, more than 30 million are not in work or education. In 2018, the quota system was scrapped following similar protests but in June the High Court reinstated it, ruling its removal was unconstitutional. On July 10, the Supreme Court suspended the quotas for one month while it took up the case. Critics and protesters say the quota system creates a two-tier Bangladesh where a politically connected elite benefit by their birth. \u201cThe freedom fighters have sacrificed a lot for the nation \u2026 for that reason this quota was a logical thing in the past,\u201d said student protester Tahmeed Hossain. \u201cBut there have been at least two generations after that. Nowadays, the quota \u2026 has rather become a form of discrimination. It has become a cultural propaganda to create a stronghold in the country.\u201d On Sunday, the country\u2019s top court dismissed the earlier ruling that brought back the quotas, directing that 93% of government jobs will be open to candidates on merit. Shah Monjurul Hoque, a lawyer representing students, said of the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling: \u201cThat is 93% quota for general people, 5% quota for freedom fighters and their kin, 1% for ethnic minority community, and 1% for third gender and physically disabled.\u201d Why did the protests escalate? The protests began at the prestigious Dhaka University on July 1 and later spread to other campuses and cities nationwide in almost daily street gatherings that included rail and road blockades. The demonstrations became violent on July 15 when members of the Bangladesh Chatra League \u2013 the\u00a0student wing of the ruling Awami League party \u2013 reportedly attacked student protesters inside the Dhaka University campus. Since then, clashes between security forces, protesters and government supporters have escalated, with Bangladesh deploying its paramilitary Rapid Action Battalion, which was sanctioned by the United States in 2021 after \u201cwidespread allegations of serious human rights abuses.\u201d The student protester Hossain told CNN he was wounded at a rally at Dhaka University on Wednesday when a projectile was thrown into the crowd. \u201cSomeone threw a small thing at us that blew up and I heard shots. I started running and realized that I had been hurt by some splinters in my hands. The police then attacked us with tear shell in the building,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of my friends got hit by a (rubber) bullet in the leg. Some of my friends got their heads smashed and are currently under treatment in the hospital.\u201d Another protester in Dhaka, Hassan Abdullah, said Thursday: \u201cThere are tear (gas) shells just 50 meters away from me as I am talking to you. The police are constantly bursting sound grenades right now.\u201d CNN cannot independently verify the accounts but the sounds of protest commotion, including multiple audible cracks, could be heard during the conversation with Abdullah. Reports of the number of people killed has varied widely, with the Dhaka-based newspaper Prothom Alo saying 19 people were killed on Thursday alone and the Agence France-Press news agency reporting\u00a032 deaths, citing its own tally compiled from hospital data. Authorities have also moved to block online communications. Internet monitoring site Netblocks confirmed a \u201cnear-total national internet shutdown\u201d across Bangladesh on Thursday. \u201cThe new measure follows earlier efforts to throttle social media and restrict mobile data services,\u201d it said on X. What has the government said? The demonstrations are the biggest challenge to Prime Minister Hasina since she secured a fourth consecutive term in January elections, which were boycotted by the main opposition party to protest what they said was a widespread crackdown on their ranks. Hasina has announced a judicial investigation into the killings and called on protesters to await the verdict of the Supreme Court. \u201cI especially urge everyone to wait patiently until the Supreme Court verdict comes. I believe our students will get justice from high court, they will not be disappointed,\u201d Hasina said in a news conference Thursday. But she has been accused of enflaming\u00a0protester anger by reportedly calling them \u201crazakar,\u201d\u00a0 an offensive term used for those who allegedly collaborated with the Pakistani army during the 1971 independence war. \u201cWe expected an apology from our prime minister for comparing us to traitors of 1952 and 1972, and a solid solution to quota reform,\u201d said protester Salman Farsi. \u201cWhat did the students do to deserve this tag?\u201d Student protesters CNN spoke to say their demonstrations have gone beyond frustration over the quota system and their anger is now directed at Hasina and her government, which human rights organizations have long warned are headed toward a one-party system. \u201cThis is a people\u2019s movement against the authoritarian government,\u201d Hossain said. \u201cThis is not just about quota protests anymore, this is much bigger than that, in simple quota protests the government wouldn\u2019t go around hurting and shooting students. This shows the current fascist and autocratic nature of the government, who has been upholding the power without any proper voting system.\u201d What has global reaction been? Bangladeshi students have held smaller protests elsewhere,\u00a0including in New York\u2019s Times Square, the Australian cities Melbourne and Sydney and the Danish capital Copenhagen. The US said it was \u201ccontinuing to monitor the reports of violence from the ongoing protests in and around Dhaka,\u201d a State Department spokesperson said in a briefing on Thursday. \u201cFreedom of expression and peaceful assembly are essential building blocks to any thriving democracy, and we condemn the recent acts of violence in Bangladesh.\u201d UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres\u00a0called for restraint on all sides and urged the government to investigate all acts of violence, according to UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric. \u201cThe secretary-general encourages the meaningful and constructive participation of youth to address the ongoing challenges in Bangladesh. Violence can never be the solution,\u201d Dujarric  said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/19/asia/bangladesh-job-quota-protests-explainer-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "world"}}

Nearly 10% of votes were deemed fraudulent, with 377 out of 3,813 votes being disqualified. Many votes were made under \u201cobvious fake names,\u201d the\u00a0Hugo Awards\u2019 administrators said in a statement Monday, explaining that\u00a0there was \u201ca run of voters whose second names were identical except that the first letter was changed, in alphabetical order,\u201d as well as a \u201crun of voters whose names were translations of consecutive numbers.\u201d Suspicions grew further as a large number of these votes were cast for one candidate in particular, who administrators have chosen not to name, citing a lack of evidence that they were aware of the ruse. They have instead been dubbed \u201cFinalist A.\u201d \u201cThis pattern of data is startlingly and obviously different from the votes for any other finalist in 2024, and indeed for any finalist in any of the previous years,\u201d the administrative team said. The Hugo Awards can only be voted on by members of the World Science Fiction Society, who gather at annual conventions commonly known as \u201cWorldcon,\u201d which brings together science fiction enthusiasts from around the globe. A membership for the World Science Fiction Society costs about $58 (\u00a345), meaning the membership fees to cast 377 fraudulent votes would cost about $21,900 (\u00a316,960).

{"id": "2024_07_23_style_paris-2024-olympic-art", "text": "The bodybuilder is causing a stir in Place Vend\u00f4me. Prada-clad pedestrians are loitering outside Gagosian\u2019s Paris showroom on rue de Castiglione, peering through its window, perplexed by the presence of a muscular man taking a breather on a bench, a damp towel dangling from his lap. He looks as if he\u2019s pondering his performance on the barbell. Outside, passers-by try to work out if this is a sweaty performance piece. It isn\u2019t. Duane Hanson\u2019s unnervingly lifelike \u201cBodybuilder\u00a0(1989\u201390)\u201d \u2014 a hollow polychrome bronze\u00a0sculpture of a shirtless iron-pumper \u2014 is the Gagosian gallery\u2019s showstopper at \u201cThe Art of the Olympics,\u201d a two-part exhibition curated in association the Olympic Museum in Lausanne to celebrate the upcoming Paris Olympic and Paralympic Games. If featuring in Instagram posts was an Olympic sport, Hanson\u2019s hunk would win gold. The gallery is selling 10 sports-related works\u00a0by artists, ranging from 20th-century masters Andy Warhol and Man Ray to contemporary figures such Andreas Gursky and Takashi Murakami. Meanwhile, across town in its rue de Ponthieu gallery, a selection of posters from the museum\u2019s collection, created for both summer and winter games over the past half a century, show how art has promoted sporting excellence. For Gagosian, the exercise is both commercial (prices for pieces range from $60,000 to over $2m) and part of a broader engagement with Parisian life. In 2019, it staged an exhibition in aid of the reconstruction of Notre-Dame. And part of the sale proceeds will go to the Olympic Refuge Foundation, which supports displaced young people through sport. The works in the exhibition\u00a0explore \u2014 either realistically or conceptually \u2014 sports such as surfing, golf, shooting, running, football and boxing, and include paintings, drawings, sculptures and photography. Pieces range from the monumental \u2014 such as Gursky\u2019s huge photograph of a soccer match between France and the Netherlands\u00a0\u2014 to the whimsical (Mark Newson\u2019s aluminium surfboard is a quirky statement piece). Art and sport fans are kindred spirits The parallels between art and sport are myriad, says Elsa Favreau, deputy director at Gagosian when we meet at the exhibition. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of money, there\u2019s a lot of competition. But I think there\u2019s also a lot of excellence.\u201d Similarly, art lovers and sports enthusiasts are kindred spirits: the cheering crowds in the stands are like bidders at auctions, while collectors support artists like football fans worship players. So, is there a dream artist-sport line-up? \u201c\u2019Gymnastics\u2019 by Degas maybe or Giacometti,\u201d suggests Favreau. One of the show\u2019s highlights \u2014 Warhol\u2019s \u201cWinter Olympics,\u201d a sketch of a skier as framed in a photographic negative \u2014 gets to the heart of sport as entertainment. The artist, who created a whole series of silkscreen paintings of sportsmen and women such as Muhammad Ali, tennis player Chris Evert and Pel\u00e9, observed that \u201cathletes are the new movie stars.\u201d Favreau agrees: \u201cWe have great artists here like Takeshi Murakami, who are so well known they are like (French soccer star) Kylian Mbappe.\u201d More stars are on view at rue de Ponthieu, where visitors can see poster art by international artists including David Hockney, Pablo Picasso, Roy Lichtenstein and Tracey Emin. An organising committee for each Olympics is responsible for commissioning artists to interpret that particular landmark moment. The Games represented at Gagosian include Munich (1972), Los Angeles (1984), Seoul (1988) and London (2012). The results are varied and joyous: Hockney created photo-collages of swimmers and figure skaters, Lichtenstein fragmented a horse and rider in motion, Warhol screen-printed a speed-skater, and Howard Hodgkin and Pierre Soulages both riffed on the ripples of the swimming pool. While Picasso\u2019s \u201cThe Dance of Youth\u201d \u2014 a composition of camaraderie and peace \u2014 was repurposed for a poster to mark the opening ceremony at the Los Angeles games, more than a decade after the painter\u2019s death. Artistic and Olympic feats have been bound together since the dawn of the modern games in the late 19th century. \u201cIt\u2019s central to us,\u201d explains Yasmin Meichtry, associate director at the Olympic Foundation for Culture and Heritage, as she shows me the works. Pierre de Coubertin, the founder of the International Olympic Committee, was influenced by the culture of ancient Greece, in which sport was an art. Conversely, Meichtry notes, \u201cthere were art competitions as part of the Olympics until 1942.\u201d One wonders how you referee watercolourists. As well as artistic trends, the posters illustrate changing fashions in typography and design. And then there are the, frequently derided, Olympic logos: London\u2019s zany squiggle triggered epileptic fits when it was animated, while Paris 2024 has whipped up an emblem that looks like a frothy curlicue on a cappuccino. The posters for the Paris games \u2014 which are not at Gagosian \u2014 have been commissioned from both French and international artists and highlight a move towards emerging and women artists. Olympians themselves are often artistically-inclined, notes Meichtry. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a strong link between Olympism and a lot of other disciplines.\u201d Again, it is about striving for distinction. There are Olympians who have become artists, musicians, chefs and fashion designers. And the Olympic Museum is drawing together those threads. It hopes to appoint an artist in residence at Lausanne in the near future and, ahead of this summer\u2019s event, has commissioned four athletes to engage with cultural activities. \u201cWe had a very nice experience in Paris with Luc Abalo, the French multi-medallist in handball. He is now a professional painter and we invited him to do a residency at a youth rehabilitation centre in the 13th Arrondissement,\u201d says Meichtry. \u201cHe was there for a week with these kids, bringing his experience as an Olympian but also as an artist.\u201d As with the games themselves, the poster art has evolved over time. \u201cWhen you look at past editions like Munich or Mexico there was more freedom,\u201d observes Meichtry. \u201cToday there are different rules: how you use the rings and commercial aspects.\u201d But the guiding message remains the same: \u201cThat Olympism is a way of life.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/23/style/paris-2024-olympic-art/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_21_middleeast_israel-strikes-houthi-rebels-explainer-intl", "text": "For the first time, Israel has struck inside Yemen, following a deadly drone attack launched by Houthi rebels on Tel Aviv. Since the October 7 attacks by Hamas on Israel, the Houthis have been targeting shipping in the Red Sea in solidarity - they say - with Gaza. After Israel struck back on Saturday, the Houthis said they launched a fresh barrage of missiles towards Israel, promising a response that will be \u201chuge and great.\u201d Direct attacks on each other\u2019s soil between the Israeli military and the Iran-backed rebel group now risk creating a new front in a conflict that already threatened to spill over into the region, with Houthi spokesperson Mohammed Abdulsalam on Sunday describing the situation as \u201copen war.\u201d Here\u2019s what we know. Who are the Houthis and what is their role in the Gaza conflict? The Houthis are an Iran-backed Islamist group based in Yemen. The Houthi movement, also known as Ansar Allah (Supporters of God), is one side in a civil war that has raged in Yemen for nearly a decade. It emerged in the 1990s, when its leader, Hussein al-Houthi, launched \u201cBelieving Youth,\u201d a religious revival movement for a centuries-old subsect of Shia Islam called Zaidism. Since a ceasefire, the Houthis have consolidated their control over most of northern Yemen. They have also sought an agreement\u00a0with Saudi Arabia,\u00a0a major rival of Iran, that would bring the war to a permanent end and cement their role as the country\u2019s rulers. The Houthis are believed to have been armed and trained by Iran. Since Hamas\u2019s attacks on October 7 attacks and Israel\u2019s subsequent ground and air offenses in Gaza, the Houthis say they have been seeking revenge against Israel for its military campaign by targeting Red Sea shipping. The US and UK have responded to those attacks by carrying out strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen. However, Israel has not taken part in those responses. In addition, Israel\u2019s army spokesman says the militant group has targeted \u201cIsraeli civilians and civilian infrastructure\u201d about 200 times in the same period. Most of those launches were intercepted by US Central Command, the spokesman said, but Israel\u2019s air defenses have also intercepted Houthi drones and missiles inside and outside Israel\u2019s airspace. What happened in Tel Aviv? A tipping point for Israel appears to have come on Friday, when a drone attack was launched on Tel Aviv, killing one\u00a0Israeli citizen and injuring several others. The attack was claimed by the Houthis, with spokesperson Yahya Sare\u2019e saying the\u00a0operation was performed by a new drone capable of \u201cbypassing the enemy\u2019s interception systems.\u201d \u201cWe will continue to strike these targets in response to the enemy\u2019s massacres and daily crimes against our brothers in the Gaza Strip,\u201d Sare\u2019e said. \u201cOur operations will only cease when the aggression stops and the siege on the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip is lifted.\u201d The attack marked the first time Tel Aviv, Israel\u2019s commercial center, has been struck by a drone in an attack claimed by the Houthis. Israel authorities are investigating the circumstances and potential security failures around the deadly drone blast. Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Daniel Hagari said that the military suspects the drone was an Iranian-made Samad-3 model, launched from Yemen, which had been upgraded to extend its range. A second drone was intercepted outside of Israeli airspace to the east at the same time as the attack, he said, adding that Israel is now upgrading its air defenses and increasing aerial patrols of its borders. How did Israel respond? Israel\u2019s response came a day later, when Israeli aircraft hit the Yemeni port of Hodeidah. The attack, which marked the first time Israel has struck Yemen, killed at least six people and injured scores more, Yemeni officials said. The Houthi-run Al Masirah TV said the strikes targeted oil facilities in the port on Yemen\u2019s west coast. Houthi\u00a0spokesperson Mohammed Abdulsalam said the strikes had also hit civilian targets and a power station. He slammed what he said was \u201cbrutal Israeli aggression\u201d aimed at increasing the \u201csuffering of the people of Yemen\u201d and pressuring the group to stop its support of Gaza. Israel\u2019s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the port was used by Iran to bring arms into Yemen. \u201cThe port we attacked\u00a0is\u00a0not\u00a0an innocent port. It was used for military purposes, it was used as an entry point for deadly weapons supplied to the Houthis\u00a0by Iran,\u201d he said in a statement on Saturday. Netanyahu also said the operation, which hit targets 1,800 km (1,118 miles) from\u00a0Israel\u2019s borders, showed\u00a0Israel\u00a0was\u00a0serious about responding to threats. \u201cIt makes it clear to our enemies that there\u00a0is\u00a0no place that the long arm of the State of\u00a0Israel will\u00a0not\u00a0reach,\u201d Netanyahu said. How big an escalation is this? Neither side have suggested they are ready to back down. \u201cIt\u2019s not in the Houthi \u2018DNA\u2019 to de-escalate with Israel,\u201d Charles Lister of the Middle East Institute wrote on X. Houthi army spokesperson Yehya Saree said the\u00a0Houthis\u00a0have\u00a0\u201cprepared\u00a0for a long war\u201d with Israel and that Tel Aviv is still not safe. Israel\u2019s Defense Minister, Yoav Gallant, warned that the \u201cblood of Israeli citizens has a price,\u201d and that if Israelis are attacked,\u00a0the\u00a0\u201cresult will be identical\u201d to that which has been seen in Lebanon and Gaza. On Sunday, Israeli military said it had intercepted a missile approaching Israeli territory from Yemen while the Houthis said they launched a \u201cnumber of ballistic missiles.\u201d The war in Gaza has already been accompanied by significantly heightened tensions between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. The two sides have been trading cross-border fire since October 8, when Hezbollah fired at three Israeli border posts \u201cin solidarity\u201d with Palestinians. Houthi leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi said on Sunday in a televised address on Houthi-run Al-Masirah TV that the group intended to continue \u201cthe fifth stage of escalation in support of Gaza.\u201d Friday\u2019s drone attack on Tel Aviv signaled the beginning of that stage, he also said. But while rising tensions with the Houthis undoubtedly creates fresh challenges for Israel, Hezbollah remains the bigger threat given its extensive arsenal and proximity to Israel. Yoel Guzansky, a senior fellow at the Tel Aviv-based Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) who has served on Israel\u2019s National Security Council, told CNN he believes Israel has until now been restrained in its response. He believes Israel was trying to send a signal to the US and the international community that \u201cenough is enough,\u201d and deliberately chose a target with high visibility. \u201cYou have to signal to a rogue actor that is attacking you that there is a price to pay, and I think this is what Israel tried to do.\u201d Like the Houthis, Hezbollah is also heavily backed by Iran, which makes no secret of its animosity towards Israel. Any increase in hostilities between Israel and Iran\u2019s proxies is seen as deeply destabilizing in the region because it could push the two countries closer towards open warfare. Israel and Iran have already traded one direct exchange since October 7. Few in the international community want to see it happen again.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/21/middleeast/israel-strikes-houthi-rebels-explainer-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_21_europe_europe-conscription-war-russia-intl", "text": "Before Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, many, including Kyiv, were skeptical that a major war could\u202freturn to Europe. More than two years on, another shift once unthinkable is underway on conscription. Several European nations have reintroduced or expanded compulsory military service amid Moscow\u2019s mounting threat, part of a range of policies aimed at boosting defenses that are likely to be scaled up even further. \u201cWe are coming to the realization that we may have to adjust the way we mobilize for war and adjust the way we produce military equipment and we recruit and train personnel,\u201d said Robert Hamilton, head of Eurasia research at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, who served as a US Army officer for 30 years. \u201cIt is tragically true that here we are, in\u202f2024, and we are grappling with the questions of how to mobilize millions of people to be thrown into a meatgrinder of a war potentially, but this is where Russia has put us,\u201d he said. The risks for a larger war in Europe have been rising after Russian President Vladimir Putin\u202f\u201cfinally resorted to open conflict\u201d in Ukraine, pursuing his aim to \u201crecreate the Soviet empire,\u201d\u202fsaid Gen. Wesley Clark (Ret.), who served as NATO\u2019s Supreme Allied Commander Europe. \u201cSo we\u2019ve now got a war in Europe that we never thought we would see again,\u201d said Clark, who led NATO forces during the Kosovo War. \u201cWhether this is a new Cold War or an emerging hot war is unclear,\u201d he continued, but \u201cit\u2019s a very imminent warning to NATO that we\u2019ve got to rebuild our defenses.\u201d Those efforts include conscription, he says. Return of conscription underscores new reality A number of European countries halted mandatory conscription after the end of the Cold War, but several nations \u2013 particularly in Scandinavia and the Baltics \u2013 have reintroduced it in recent years, largely because of the Russian threat. Failure to enlist can result in fines or even jail time in some countries. Latvia is the latest to implement conscription. Compulsory military service \u202fwas reintroduced on January 1 this year, after being abolished in 2006. Male citizens will be put up for the draft within 12 months of reaching the age of 18, or graduation for those still in the education system. \u201cAt first there was a lot of pushback,\u201d said Arturs P\u012bl\u0101cis, a 20-year-old student. He\u2019s yet to go up for the draft but voluntarily went on a month-long military course. But ultimately, \u201cthe need for a state defence service was clear,\u201d he said. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t really an option where we can stand by and think things will go on as they were before because of the unprovoked aggression in Ukraine.\u201d In April, Norway presented an ambitious long-term plan that will nearly double the country\u2019s defense budget and add more than 20,000 conscripted soldiers, employees, and reservists to the armed forces. \u201cWe need a defense that is fit for purpose in the emerging security environment,\u201d Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re said. Conscription in Norway is mandatory and in 2015 it became the first member of the NATO defensive alliance to conscript both men and women on equal terms. Economics student Jens Bartnes, 26,\u202fcompleted his military training at the age of 19. \u201cI am happy I did it, I learned a lot from that year that I wouldn\u2019t learn otherwise \u2013 about myself, about my physical and mental limits and abilities I suppose, but also about teamwork. It\u2019s a whole different way of life,\u201d he said. \u201cI am willing to fight for my country if need be, because I believe in the values that the Norwegian society is built on and I believe those values of inclusion and equality and democracy are worth fighting for,\u201d Bartnes added. Max Henrik Arvidson,\u202f25, was conscripted into the Norwegian military for one year between 2019 and 2020. Like Bartnes, he sees military service as an essential duty. \u201cI know the only way we can stand against more Russian aggression is by keep supplying Ukraine with weapons and aid, while standing strong together with NATO as a whole and the European Union.\u201d \u2018Big mental shift\u2019 Debates about conscription have also been taking place in other European countries that currently don\u2019t require it. In the UK, the Conservatives floated the idea of military service in their ill-fated election campaign. But perhaps the most surprising transformation is underway in Germany, which since the end of World War II has had an aversion to militarization. In another first since the Cold War, Germany this year updated its plan should conflict erupt in Europe, and Defense Minister Boris Pistorius presented a proposal in June for a new voluntary military service. \u201cWe must be ready for war by 2029,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are seeing the debate now raging. And that\u2019s the first step,\u201d said Sean Monaghan, a visiting fellow in the Europe, Russia, and Eurasia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t happen overnight, it\u2019s a big mental shift.\u201d Not everyone is ready to answer the call. In Lithuania, for instance, opinions about military service among students vary, said Paulius Vaitiekus, president of Lithuania\u2019s National Students\u2019 Union. Since the country reintroduced compulsory military service in 2015 due to a \u201cchanged geopolitical situation,\u201d about 3,500 to 4,000 Lithuanians between the ages of 18 and 26 are enlisted each year for a period of nine months. Vaitiekus\u202fsaid students have launched initiatives to send supplies to the Ukrainian frontlines. There was \u201ca shift in the mindset of the youth towards being more active, although not necessarily through conscripting,\u201d he added. With conscription remaining an unpopular topic in some countries, NATO is struggling to meet its new goal of having 300,000 personnel ready to be activated within one month and another half a million available within six months, Monaghan said. \u201cWhile NATO has stated it has already met that goal, the EU has said its members would struggle. NATO relies on American forces to meet its target. European allies need to find new ways to generate personnel. Something has to give here,\u201d he said. Another problem is that that target would only allow NATO to fight a relatively short conflict of up to six months, Monaghan added. Large strategic reserve force models A possible solution is a more nimble, modern military. One of NATO\u2019s newest members, Finland,\u202fhas the capacity to activate more than 900,000 reservists, with 280,000 military personnel being ready to respond immediately if needed. However, during peacetime, the Finnish Defence Forces employs only about 13,000 people, including civilian staff. \u201cFinland is a good example\u201d as its reserve force can be integrated into a very small active force, said Hamilton, of the Foreign Policy Research Institute. Historically, he explained, Finland was \u201cwedged\u201d between NATO and the Soviet Union, aligned with neither, so needed to be able to defend itself alone. Norway and Sweden, NATO\u2019s newest member, have similar models, both maintaining significant numbers of reservists, though not as many as Finland. Sweden, where conscription is now also gender-neutral, called up around 7,000 individuals in 2024. The number will rise to 8,000 in 2025, according to the Swedish Armed Forces. Since the start of the war in Ukraine, \u201cwhat we see is that both knowledge and the attitude have changed,\u201d she said. \u201cSweden has had conscription since 1901 so it\u2019s really part of our culture in a way,\u201d said Marinette Nyh Radebo, communications manager at the agency that helps test recruits and reports to the Ministry of Defense. \u201cWhen the conscription was activated again, in the beginning, we said that conscription is good for your CV, for applying for a new job for example,\u201d Radebo said. \u201cBut today our communication is more like, this is a duty that you have to do for Sweden.\u201d Is NATO ready for war? The NATO alliance has been revising its strategy and boosting capabilities over the past decade in response to the growing threat from Moscow. Russia\u2019s full-scale assault on Ukraine in 2022, which followed its support for pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine and illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014, inevitably prompted allies to reassess whether they were ready for war and strengthen their defenses. \u201cSince 2014, NATO has undergone the most significant transformation in our collective defense in a generation,\u201d NATO spokesperson Farah Dakhlallah told CNN. \u201cWe have put in place the most comprehensive defense plans since the Cold War, with currently more than 500,000 troops at high readiness.\u201d But there are calls for allies to increase their capabilities further and faster. While NATO allies \u201care definitely ready to fight tonight,\u201d there is still a question of whether they are ready for a protracted war such as that in Ukraine, Monaghan said, pointing out there is still work to be done in a number of areas. Those include industrial capacity, defense spending and societal resilience \u2013 where the question of conscription would come in. The way military personnel are recruited and trained is a decision for individual nations, Dakhlallah said, adding: \u201cAround a third of NATO members have some form of compulsory military service.\u201d \u201cSome allies are weighing up conscription. However as an alliance we do not prescribe mandatory military service,\u201d Dakhlallah said. \u201cThe important thing is that allies continue to have capable armed forces to protect our territory and our populations.\u201d In addition to the fighting in Ukraine, Russia has also launched a hybrid war across Europe, experts say, involving attacks on infrastructure, cyberattacks, disinformation, sabotage, election interference and the weaponization of migration. \u201cThat has only become more aggressive,\u201d Monaghan said. \u201cAll of which is to say NATO allies face a very different geopolitical situation than they did over the last couple of decades.\u201d The situation could be further complicated by the US presidential election in November. Things will look very different if former President Donald Trump \u2013 who has said he would encourage Russia to do \u201cwhatever the hell they want\u201d to any NATO country that doesn\u2019t meet the bloc\u2019s defense spending guidelines \u2013 returns to the White House. \u201cI think there is a very good understanding among the military leaders of NATO that they must cooperate, and there is a desire to do that,\u201d Clark said. This year saw World War II veterans gather for D-Day commemorations, some possibly for the last time. Their descendants may now have to take on the kind of responsibility that it was hoped would not be needed again. \u201cI think young people in Europe and the US will come to realize that this generation, like the generation that fought WWII, it didn\u2019t ask to be the \u2018Greatest Generation,\u2019 but the circumstances thrust that burden on them,\u201d Clark said. \u201cIn democracies, we don\u2019t like to prepare for war, we don\u2019t want to think about these things,\u201d\u202fhe said. However, \u201cI think people will respond to the circumstances that they see.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/21/europe/europe-conscription-war-russia-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_17_uk_king-charles-iii-unveils-keir-starmers-plans-for-britain-in-state-opening-of-parliament", "text": "Keir Starmer, Britain\u2019s new prime minister, pitched himself as an antidote to \u201cthe snake oil charm of populism\u201d on Wednesday, unveiling sweeping plans to target housebuilding, crime, illegal migration and a breakdown in public trust during the first ceremonial King\u2019s Speech of his government. King Charles III formally opened a new session of parliament by reading out Starmer\u2019s agenda at a grandiose event that brings together Britain\u2019s royal pageantry and political class, two weeks after his landslide landslide election win brought a 14-year era of Conservative rule to an emphatic end. The speech focused on Starmer\u2019s central slogan of \u201cnational renewal,\u201d and included pledges to nationalize Britain\u2019s railways, tackle a housing crisis by changing planning laws to build more affordable homes, and intensifying efforts to tackle illegal migration. Starmer more broadly took swipes at the Tory governments that had ruled Britain since 2010, and at the swell of populism that has rippled across the UK and Europe, attempting to lay claim to Britain\u2019s center ground with a public push for pragmatism. \u201cNo more wedge issues. No more gimmicks,\u201d Starmer told lawmakers in the House of Commons as debate on his agenda began, insisting his government would \u201csolve problems, not exploit them.\u201d \u201cThe fight for trust is the battle that defines our political era,\u201d Starmer said. His 40-bill agenda includes measures crafted to appeal to both older and younger generations, as Starmer seeks to maintain the broad coalition of voters that put him into Downing Street earlier this month. But his introduction to that agenda also contained an effort to counteract the rise of populism in the UK and Europe. \u201cThe snake oil charm of populism may sound seductive, but it drives us into the dead end of further division and greater disappointment,\u201d Starmer said. While the speech fleshed out some of the growth-orientated vision Starmer pitched during the summer\u2019s election campaign, it was light on details on other areas, including how Starmer would meaningfully bolster Britain\u2019s border security after an election campaign disrupted by public concern over small boat crossings to the UK. And Starmer opted to swerve some of the thornier constitutional and voting changes he had pledged to make during the campaign, including an upper age limit on peers allowed to sit in the House of Lords, and the lowering of the voting age to 16. Pomp and politics collide The state opening of parliament is a rare collision of pomp and politics, featuring a series of centuries-old flourishes and conventions that catch even many of Britain\u2019s lawmakers off guard. The production began when King Charles III and his wife, Camilla, made their way by carriage from Buckingham Palace to the Houses of Parliament, before MPs were summoned by Black Rod \u2013 a role established in the 1300s \u2013 to watch his speech in the House of Lords chamber. Starmer and his defeated rival, Conservative leader Rishi Sunak, shared a warm conversation before and after the speech, their roles dramatically reversed after the election on July 4 that saw Labour win a landslide in parliament, although with a modest share of the votes. Once the speech began, focus shifted to the first Labour legislative plan in a decade and a half. It put at its heart an effort to build, after a decade of stalled growth that had seen housing and infrastructure projects scuppered across Britain. Starmer also formalized plans to renationalize Britain\u2019s rail network in the coming years, and to create a publicly-owned renewable energy company. Other parts of the speech continued Labour\u2019s efforts to appeal to traditionally conservative voters who have lost faith in the Tory party after a tumultuous stretch in government. In particular, Starmer promised a clampdown on illegal migration and small boat crossings across the Channel \u2013 an issue that plagued successive Conservative governments and gave rise to a surge in support for Reform UK, a populist anti-migrant bloc that won more than 4 million votes in the election. The speech pledged extra powers for law enforcement to investigate people smuggling, including stopping and searching at the border, and the creation of a new Border Security Command. It also promised to clear Britain\u2019s vast asylum backlog, which has ballooned to near 100,000 people in recent years and forced the government to accommodate asylum seekers in hotels and detention centers for months while they await news on their claim. At home, a number of institutions were targeted for modernization \u2013 most awkwardly, the very room in which Charles gave his speech. Under government plans, hereditary peers will no longer be able to sit and vote in the House of Lords, in a \u201cfirst step in wider reform\u201d to the chamber. A new draft Race Equality Bill will meanwhile make it mandatory for large employers to report ethnicity and disability pay in the same way they currently report gender pay. And legislation for a long-awaited ban on both gay and transgender conversion therapy \u2013 efforts to change someone\u2019s sexual orientation or gender identity \u2013 was announced, having been first trailed by Theresa May in 2018 but never brought to light. Sunak tells Starmer he \u201cmust now deliver change\u201d Starmer acknowledged a breakdown in belief among the British public that politics can be a force for good \u2013 trust in politics is at record lows, studies have suggested, after a lengthy period dominated by scandal in Westminster. But his agenda will be underpinned by a large dealing of skepticism that Britain\u2019s public services can be revived without a much larger infusion of cash than the government is offering. Little in the speech focused on Britain\u2019s National Health Service (NHS), or on its social care sector, where the priority will be management rather than new legislation. After the King read Starmer\u2019s speech, MPs gathered in the Commons to debate Labour\u2019s agenda, with former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak promising to lead the opposition constructively while a drawn-out contest to replace him as Conservative leader takes place. \u201cThe party opposite has successfully tapped into the public\u2019s desire for change, but they must now deliver change,\u201d Sunak said. He and Starmer had shared warm exchanges earlier in the day \u2013 which Starmer said had partially focused on England\u2019s football team \u2013 but the rigor of Britain\u2019s politics returned and tension crept back into the chamber as Sunak criticized the scrapping of his plan to deport some asylum seekers to Rwanda, and claimed that Labour had inherited, thanks to his work, an economy on an upward trajectory. And Sunak urged Starmer to match his committment to increase the UK\u2019s defense spending to 2.5% of its GDP, saying it \u201cwill show the Americans that we do not expect them to bear every burden\u201d within NATO. Those arguments will intensify in the coming weeks, as Labour introduces its first bills to Parliament \u2013 beginning with three priority measures from the speech later this week.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/uk/king-charles-iii-unveils-keir-starmers-plans-for-britain-in-state-opening-of-parliament/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_19_asia_israel-invitation-to-hiroshima-japan-sparked-controversy-intl-hnk", "text": "Hiroshima, the Japanese city devastated by a US atomic bomb in 1945, is at the center of a growing controversy after local officials dismissed calls to disinvite Israel from its annual ceremony promoting world peace as war rages in Gaza. Every year on August 6, Hiroshima gathers foreign officials, along with locals, in a minute of silence at 8:15 a.m. to mark the exact moment the bomb dropped, killing tens of thousands of people and leading to the end of World War II. Some activists and atomic bomb survivors\u2019 groups say the ceremony is no place for Israel, which is pounding Gaza with strikes as it seeks to eradicate\u00a0Hamas in response to the Palestinian militant group\u2019s devastating attack on October 7 last year. They say the Hiroshima city government should exclude Israel from this year\u2019s ceremony, as it has Russia and Belarus for the past two years over Moscow\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. But Hiroshima authorities say they have no intention of excluding Israel. \u201cIt is not a double standard. Our policy is to invite all countries. However, Russia and Belarus are exceptions due to the invasion of Ukraine,\u201d a Hiroshima city government spokesperson told CNN. \u201cRussia and Belarus are not invited in order to ensure the ceremony goes smoothly.\u201d Authorities in Nagasaki, the\u00a0Japanese city hit by an atomic bomb just days after Hiroshima, told CNN they haven\u2019t decided whether to invite Israel to their peace ceremony on August 9. Israel\u2019s war in Gaza may \u201cprevent the smooth execution of the ceremony,\u201d they said, stressing the move was not a gesture of protest but a practical consideration. Calls for Israel\u2019s exclusion Of the two ceremonies, Hiroshima\u2019s is the largest with representatives from\u00a0115 countries and the European Union set to attend this year. Envoys from Russia and Belarus haven\u2019t attended since Hiroshima excluded them in 2022 following Moscow\u2019s invasion of\u00a0Ukraine in February that year. Russia used Belarus as one of the launch pads for its assault and later moved some of its tactical nuclear weapons there. This year\u2019s Hiroshima Peace Memorial Ceremony takes place against the backdrop of the war in Gaza, where Israel\u2019s bombardment has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and displaced nearly the entire enclave\u2019s more than 2 million people, who now face severe shortages of food, shelter, water and medical supplies. \u201cWhy invite Israel if they are committing genocide-like crimes, just like Russia and Belarus?\u201d said Tetsuji Kumada, executive director of Hiroshima\u2019s Confederation of A- and H-Bomb Sufferers Organization, one of the groups opposing Israel\u2019s presence. \u201cIt is very disappointing that our request wasn\u2019t taken into account,\u201d he told CNN, adding that the organization wrote to the Hiroshima government in June to ask for Israel to be disinvited. Another group, Hiroshima-Palestine Vigil Community, launched an online petition in May, calling for Israel\u2019s representatives to be excluded, saying that \u201ccurrent global protests against Israel clearly outnumber those against Russia in both scale and frequency.\u201d The petition has since amassed more than 30,000 signatures. Israel has repeatedly rejected accusations from critics as well as rights groups and experts that it has broken international humanitarian law with the breadth of its response to Hamas\u2019 attacks. It argues its war is against Hamas, not Palestinians, although anger over the extent of the destruction and civilian deaths in Gaza has swelled globally. CNN has reached out to the Israeli embassy in Japan for comment. Japan has taken a strong stance in Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine, pledging to stand with Kyiv, offering billions of dollars in humanitarian aid and military vehicles and equipment for mine-clearing operations. It has also imposed sanctions on Russia. Meanwhile, Tokyo has offered humanitarian aid to Gaza, expressed \u201cdeep concern\u201d for the critical situation in the strip and supports a two-state solution to the conflict. According to Japanese news agency Kyodo News, the Hiroshima government referred to the war in Gaza in its invitation to Israel, urging the country to cease its offensive. The invitation said it was \u201cdeeply regrettable that the lives and everyday existences of many people are being taken away,\u201d Kyodo reported. Palestinians not invited The bombing of Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, and Nagasaki three days later led to Japan\u2019s unconditional surrender and brought an end to World War II. But it also killed tens of thousands of people, both instantly and in the months and years to come due to radiation sickness. Every year, diplomats in Japan are invited to Hiroshima to join the commemoration that highlights the importance of peace and cautions against the use of nuclear weapons. But while some advocacy\u00a0groups urged Hiroshima to shun Israel, others supported its presence. \u201cAs a city of international peace, Hiroshima city needs to invite all nations, regardless of whether they are at war or not,\u201d said Kunihiko Sakuma, president of Hiroshima Hidankyo, an atomic bomb survivors\u2019 advocacy group. However,\u00a0the Permanent General Mission of Palestine in Tokyo complained on social platform X that it had not been invited to the ceremony. \u201cThis decision is a double standard,\u201d it said. Its envoy was never invited to the ceremony, the office told CNN. Hiroshima authorities said they only send invitations to countries with embassies in Japan and have never invited Palestinian representatives to the ceremony. At a news conference last week, Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa reiterated Japan\u2019s support for a two-state solution. \u201cWe continue to comprehensively consider the recognition of Palestinian statehood, taking into account how to advance the peace process,\u201d she said.
