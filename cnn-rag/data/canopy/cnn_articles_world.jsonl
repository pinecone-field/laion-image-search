Mosley, a television doctor who popularized a type of intermittent fasting known as the 5:2 diet, was on vacation when he went missing on Wednesday, sparking an enormous days-long search involving the police, fire service, coast guard and volunteers. His body was found on Sunday about a two-hour walk from Agios Nikolaos beach, from where he set off on his walk. Police believe he died around 4 p.m. local time (9 a.m. ET) on Wednesday, the day he went missing, Greek police spokeswoman Konstantia Dimoglidou told CNN. An initial autopsy concluded that Mosley died from natural causes and that there were no injuries on his body that could have caused his death, the BBC reported. Dimoglidou told CNN that police do not believe Mosley had been sitting down for long before dying, as his time of death was similar to the length of time it would have taken for him to reach the spot. Mosley\u2019s body was found when a boat carrying the island\u2019s mayor, Lefteris Papakalodoukas, and some journalists spotted him lying face-up next to a fence about 20 meters (66 feet) above Agia Marina beach, Papakalodoukas told the Associated Press. The position in which his body was found suggests he was sitting at the time of his death, Dimoglidou said. Mosley\u2019s wife, Dr. Clare Bailey, paid tribute to her \u201cwonderful, funny, kind and brilliant\u201d husband after his body was found, saying that he \u201cdid an incredible climb, took the wrong route and collapsed where he couldn\u2019t be easily seen by the extensive search team.\u201d   His family have identified the body to police but a formal identification using DNA samples has yet to take place, Dimoglidou added. The television doctor was known for British documentary shows such as Channel 4\u2019s \u201cMichael Mosley: Who Made Britain Fat?\u201d and the BBC\u2019s \u201cTrust Me, I\u2019m A Doctor.\u201d The 67-year-old broadcaster was also a regular on talk shows such as the BBC\u2019s \u201cThe One Show\u201d and ITV\u2019s \u201cThis Morning,\u201d and was a columnist for the Daily Mail. He authored a book on the Fast 800 diet, which focuses on time-restricted eating for rapid weight loss. His wife wrote a recipe book as part of \u201cThe Fast 800\u201d book series. In 2002, Mosley was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for outstanding non-fiction special (informational) after executive producing the 2001 BBC mini-series \u201cThe Human Face,\u201d which examined the science behind facial beauty, expression and fame. The fathe- of-four deliberately infested himself with parasites to learn more about them for BBC\u2019s 2014 show \u201cInfested! Living with Parasites.\u201d Mosley\u2019s impact on public health, particularly in Britain, was evident in the tributes paid to him. Former lawmaker Tom Watson wrote on social media that Mosley \u201cwas a hero to me,\u201d and that he \u201chelped thousands of people get well and healthy. I\u2019m one of them.\u201d Meanwhile, a spokesperson for British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said Mosley \u201cwill be known as an extraordinary broadcaster who used his platform to influence and change the way we think about many public health issues,\u201d according to PA Media.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/europe/michael-mosley-died-unwell-greek-police-intl-scli-gbr/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_08_americas_edmundo-gonzalez-venezuela-profile-intl-latam", "text": "Restraint is a rare quality for a politician, especially in Venezuela, a country whose recent leaders have been synonymous with vitriolic populism. Hugo Chavez, the late president who still casts a formidable shadow across the country more than ten years after his death, used to speak for hours on his television show,\u00a0Hello President!, while his firebrand successor, incumbent President Nicolas Maduro, is equally capable of clocking 60-plus minutes of uninterrupted oratory when the mood takes him. So it\u2019s telling that the man tasked with challenging Maduro in Venezuela\u2019s presidential election next month is a man of few words. Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia, the official candidate of a large opposition coalition known as the Democratic Unitary Platform, has a habit of answering his questions in single sentences, often stopping before the interviewer has the time to think of a follow-up. It\u2019s an unexpected approach from a presidential candidate aiming to drum up voter enthusiasm in order to take on an authoritarian leader who in the last ten years has dug into power by allegedly rigging elections and\u00a0violating human rights. But Gonzalez is not your typical Venezuelan politician. After decades in the foreign service (he was an ambassador to Algeria and Argentina) and then as a back bench manager for Venezuela\u2019s opposition, Gonzalez was only selected as a coalition candidate because two other opposition leaders \u2013 Maria Corina Machado and Corina Yoris \u2013 had been barred from running and a deadline was looming. \u201cI never imagined I would find myself in this situation,\u201d he told Venezuelan media in late April, shortly after his candidature was formalized. Yet since then, his poise and calm have helped him build a comfortable lead against Maduro, according to recent polls. Opposition, a dangerous business Challenging Maduro\u2019s near total grip on power can be a dangerous business. Over the years, he has jailed or exiled dozens of opposition leaders, some of them for years. And hundreds of people have been killed in political violence in Venezuela in the past decade, often at the hands of state security forces. But most analysts agree Gonzalez represents the best chance that Venezuela\u2019s political opposition has had to dislodge Maduro from power since 2013. His name is already on the ballot for the July 28 presidential vote, and the government has so far shown little appetite for going after him. In October, the Maduro government and the opposition, along with representatives from the United States, signed a comprehensive agreement in Barbados where Maduro pledged to hold free and fair elections in exchange for sanctions relief from Washington. Since then, there have been mixed signals on both sides about the extent of the deal: US-imposed oil sanctions have only partially been lifted and most of Maduro\u2019s close circle is still subject to individual sanctions, while on May 28, Caracas withdrew an invitation for the European Union to send electoral observers to monitor the upcoming vote. Gonzalez claims he\u2019s not worried about possible persecution, telling CNN En Espa\u00f1ol that he is \u201cvery calm, confident although aware of the enormous challenge\u201d the opposition is up against. Asked about the prospect of a repeat of the 2018 election, which Maduro won amid widespread allegations of vote-rigging and a boycott by the opposition, Gonzalez says he hopes pressure from other countries will force Maduro\u2019s hand. Most experts say the international community is unlikely to intervene in Venezuela again after the debacle of the 2019 opposition uprising led by Juan Guaido, the then-opposition leader who swore himself in as interim president and was recognized by more than fifty countries \u2013 only for Maduro to retain power and ride out the storm unscathed. But Gonzalez seems buoyant nonetheless. \u201cFraud, vote rigging, and threats are nothing new for us,\u201d Gonzalez told CNN En Espa\u00f1ol, \u201cBut we\u2019re confident that on the day the opposition vote will be so massive our victory will be indisputable.\u201d His family is not so tranquil. \u201cWe are worried, no doubt,\u201d Gonzalez\u2019s daughter Mariana told CNN. \u201cBut we\u2019re trying to live one day at a time, because if we start thinking of what could happen, this or that, we stop moving,\u201d she said. The biggest question But how to convince an authoritarian government entrenched in power for decades to voluntarily give up control and lead a democratic transition? Gonzalez has never offered an answer to the question that hangs the July vote. Instead of detailing a roadmap to democracy, he has only hinted at what steps he would take should he win in July and the electoral authority effectively certify the result. He said his biggest priorities would be\u00a0taming\u00a0inflation, another of Venezuela\u2019s chronic ills\u00a0and\u00a0currently running at 64% year on year, and restoring trust in\u00a0the\u00a0institutions of power\u00a0such as the judiciary, currently stacked by Maduro\u2019s sympathizers. The fate of the incumbent and his closest allies \u2013 several of whom are under investigation in the Hague for crimes against humanity \u2013 remain in the balance. But amnesty for outgoing officials could be on the table, Gonzalez told CNN en Espa\u00f1ol. \u201cIn all political transitions and political crises, you have amnesty agreements and transitional justice. All the countries who have gone through situations like ours have ended up granting it, so I don\u2019t rule out we could take a similar measure in Venezuela,\u201d he said. While the election is slated for late July, Venezuela law mandates that the winning candidate won\u2019t take office before January 2025 \u2013 creating a delicate 6-month handover period that Gonzalez would have to manage carefully if he wins. \u201cThose six months will be key for him as a president-elect, while the entire state apparatus remains under the control of the regime,\u201d said Sadio Garavini di Tullio, a classmate of Gonzalez who also served in the foreign office and helped manage the opposition in the Chavez years. \u201cEdmundo however can be that person; he can give a lot of guarantees to everyone involved with the regime.\u201d \u201cHe will not be the president of the opposition government, he\u2019ll be the president of the transition government,\u201d Garavini di Tullio said. George Eickhoff, a German diplomat who served as director of the Konrad Adenauer Foundation in Caracas between 2008 and 2013 and remains close to Gonzalez, made a similar point. \u201cEdmundo is a public servant, he knows there cannot be any revenge [against the government],\u201d Eickhoff told CNN. \u201cHe has already started to speak to the other side: for the opposition, Machado is the firebrand messenger to galvanize its base, while Edmundo is an extension of the soft message, he\u2019s very realistic about his task.\u201d Asked about the possibility of vote-rigging by the Maduro regime, Gonzalez was sanguine. \u201cWe\u2019re aware we\u2019re facing an enemy,\u201d he began \u2013 then corrected himself, softening the message: \u201cAn adversary that has no qualms about using any advantage the system gives them.\u201d Grandfather figure The dual message has been visible throughout this first month of the political campaigning period, with Machado, a long-time conservative politician who first ran for president in 2012, holding public rallies in every street, while Gonzalez has dispensed calmness from his home in Caracas. When Gonzalez\u2019s candidature was formalized in April, a portrait of him by Bloomberg photographer Gaby Oraa went viral in Venezuela. It shows the candidate feeding four colorful tropical parrots called\u00a0guacamayas, typical of Caracas. Across the city, citizens routinely feed these wild birds who can display a pet-like loyalty. \u201cThey come every day, two, three, four\u2026 sometimes even ten. They are his friends,\u201d said Mariana, Gonzalez\u2019s daughter. \u201cThe\u00a0guacamayas\u00a0come in the morning and in the evening, he can spend hours just feeding them sunflower seeds. He takes care of them.\u201d His other passions, according to those who know him well, are baseball, the Real Madrid football club, family barbecues, and reading. Fans see in him a grandfather-of-the-nation type figure who could usher in a new era after the political violence of the last decade, pointing to his electoral slogan \u201cEdmundo, president for all\u201d, as well as his age (73) and family situation (he has four grandchildren). Two of those grandchildren now live in Spain, among the more than seven million Venezuelans who have fled the country in recent years. He hopes that an opposition victory in July would encourage at least some of that diaspora to return. \u201cIt\u2019s time for the big Venezuelan family to come together once more,\u201d he told CNN en Espa\u00f1ol. \u201cIt\u2019s time that the adversary is respected as such, and not seen as an enemy,\u201d he added.

{"id": "2024_06_07_weather_heat-dome-wave-record-temperatures-southwest", "text": "A dangerous heat wave is expanding into new areas of the West and lingering in others Friday, bringing with it record-breaking temperatures and a serious risk of heat-related illness. The searing heat has already taken its toll. Since last weekend, multiple people in different parts of the US have died or have been hospitalized due to heat-related illnesses. The worst of the heat peaked Thursday for much of California and the Southwest, but unseasonably hot conditions will stick around in these areas and expand into the Pacific Northwest at least through the weekend. Heat alerts are in effect for more than 16 million people in California, Nevada, Arizona, Utah and New Mexico. Most will last through Friday but alerts in Las Vegas and Death Valley, California, last into Saturday. Several notable temperature records were broken Thursday in California, Arizona and Nevada. In California, a high of 122 degrees in Death Valley broke a daily record set in 1996. And in Fresno, a 121-year-old record was tied Thursday when the city maxed out at 107 degrees. Phoenix recorded its first high of 110 degrees or more this year when thermometers topped out at a daily record-setting 113 degrees Thursday. Las Vegas soared to 111 degrees Thursday, the earliest in the year the city has reached the mark, breaking the daily record of 110 degrees set in 2010. Several people across US have died from heat-related illnesses Six people believed to be migrants have died because of the heat in the past week along the US-Mexico border from southwestern Texas to New Mexico, according to US Border Patrol and the Sunland Park, New Mexico, fire department. Four people died \u201cfrom heat stroke and dehydration\u201d while triple-digit temperatures baked the area last weekend, the US Border Patrol, El Paso Sector said. Two more people were discovered in a desert area about six miles from the border in Sunland Park and were pronounced dead Wednesday, Sunland Park fire chief Daniel Medrano told CNN. Sunland Park is around 10 miles northwest of El Paso, Texas, along the New Mexico-Mexico border. Excessive heat is the leading weather related killer in the US, according to the National Weather Service. \u201cThis is especially true in the urban centers, where population density, the urban heat island, and building construction exacerbate the effects of excessive heat,\u201d the weather service says. \u201cA combination of high heat and humidity can lead to heat related illness, including heat cramps, heat exhaustion, and heat stroke.\u201d In the East, a 59-year-old man died of heat-related complications in Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland, officials said Wednesday. Additional details about the man\u2019s death, which was the state\u2019s first heat-related death of the year, were not released. Heat proved challenging for firefighters battling a blaze in California\u2019s Napa County Wednesday. Four firefighters were sent to area hospitals for injuries related to difficult terrain and \u201chot summer conditions,\u201d according to CAL Fire\u2019s Sonoma-Lake-Napa Unit. All four are expected to make full recoveries. Phoenix emergency responders on Thursday say they hospitalized 11 people due to heat exhaustion while they were attending a Donald Trump rally at the Dream City Church. With the risk of heat-related illnesses increasing for millions across the country, officials in several states are trying to keep residents safe during the smoldering heat. In California, cooling centers have been set up for those affected by triple-digit heat. As Texas contends with both severe storms and excessive heat, a state disaster declaration remains active. Hazardous heat expected into weekend Heat will continue through the weekend before easing off a bit early next week. However, many typically hot areas in the West will still have to contend with temperatures up to 10 degrees above normal and warm nighttime lows will make it difficult for those vulnerable to extreme conditions to be able to cool off. The Las Vegas metro area is at \u201cextreme\u201d risk from the heat through Saturday, according to a scale from the National Weather Service that gauges heat\u2019s potential impact on people\u2019s health. The highest level on the heat risk scale means residents without enough cooling and hydration will be impacted, and \u201cimpacts are likely in most health systems, heat-sensitive industries and infrastructure.\u201d Several more large metro areas in Arizona, California, New Mexico and Texas will face a \u201cmajor\u201d Level 3 of 4 heat risk. Summerlike heat will expand north and east Friday and reach the Northwest and parts of the Rockies. Records could be broken in parts of Oregon, Washington and Idaho from Friday through the weekend. While it won\u2019t be record-breaking, Seattle could come close to 80 degrees on Saturday, 10 degrees warmer than what\u2019s typical for early June.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/weather/heat-dome-wave-record-temperatures-southwest/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "world"}}

The blaze was still burning on Wednesday afternoon, more than 24 hours after it began, and authorities and citizens in the Danish capital have started reckoning with the loss of one of the city\u2019s most recognizable landmarks. Local firefighters continued to try to put out the fire, which ripped through\u00a0the building \u2013 known locally as B\u00f8rsen \u2013\u00a0from early Tuesday, reaching all its floors and causing the collapse of a dragon-tail spire that had long been a symbol of the city. The walls of the building are still standing, but the interior has been significantly damaged and the roof is partially collapsed. Firefighters used cranes to hose water down into the building. Copenhagen\u00a0police meanwhile launched an investigation on Wednesday, which they said will be a \u201ccomplicated process.\u201d Police officer Brian Belling said authorities have already \u201cconducted interviews, secured surveillance and carried out a large number of investigative steps.\u201d \u201cBut of course, there is still a lot to do, especially as we have not yet had the opportunity to examine\u00a0B\u00f8rsen itself,\u201d Belling added. The 17th century building exemplified the style of the Dutch Renaissance, and housed a number of artworks, some of which were saved on Tuesday. Residents were stunned by the outbreak, which brought back memories of the fire that tore through the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris exactly five years and a day earlier. \u201cMy first thought was (that) I hope that they rebuild it \u2013 it\u2019s never going to be the same but it\u2019s iconic to\u00a0Copenhagen\u00a0and Denmark,\u201d teacher Eva Simoni Lomholdt, 58, told Reuters. Brian Mikkelsen, the CEO of the Danish Chamber of Commerce which owns the building, told the news agency that a firefighter gave him the top of the spire on Wednesday morning after it was recovered following its fall. \u201cIt gives me hope because we have decided to rebuild the stock exchange because it\u2019s part of European history as a trading continent,\u201d he said. The old stock exchange \u2013 located only a few minutes walk from Christiansborg\u00a0Palace \u2013 dates back to 1625. It was built in the Dutch Renaissance style at the request of King Christian IV and had recently been undergoing renovations with its facade covered in scaffolding and protective coverings. It has been at the heart of Danish business since then; while it no longer houses the Danish stock exchange, it serves as the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce. Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said Tuesday a \u201cpiece of Danish history\u201d was on fire, calling the building \u201cirreplaceable.\u201d Denmark\u2019s culture minister Jakob Engel-Schmidt added that 400 years of cultural heritage had been damaged. \u201cHow touching it is to see how the employees at B\u00f8rsen, good people from the emergency services and passers-by work together to rescue art treasures and iconic images from the burning building,\u201d he said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/17/style/copenhagen-stock-exchange-fire-police-investigation-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_06_americas_cuba-russian-ships-submarine-visit-intl-latam", "text": "A group of Russian naval ships, including a nuclear-powered submarine, will visit Cuba next week as part of \u201chistorically friendly relations,\u201d Cuba\u2019s government said Thursday. The Russian \u201cfrigate Gorshkov, the nuclear-powered submarine Kazan, the fleet oil tanker Pashin, and the rescue tug Nikolai Chiker\u201d will visit the port of Havana between June 12 and 17, according to the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces in a statement published by the Foreign Ministry. Cuba says none of the ships carry nuclear weapons and insists their stopover does not represent a threat to the region. \u201cVisits by naval units from other countries are a historical practice of the revolutionary government with nations that maintain relations of friendship and collaboration,\u201d the statement added. Moscow has not confirmed the information provided by Cuba. CNN has reached out to the Russian government for comment. It\u2019s not the first time Russian Navy ships have been sent to Cuba, a key ally to the former Soviet Union during the Cold War that briefly hosted nuclear missiles at Moscow\u2019s behest during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. Last July, the Russian Navy\u2019s training class ship Perekop sailed into Havana for a four-day visit. The latest visit appears to be the largest of its kind in years. Cuba is increasingly reliant on Russian oil and aid as the communist-run country weathers its worst economic crisis in decades. Cuba\u2019s announcement comes days after US President Joe Biden gave Ukraine permission to carry out limited strikes inside Russian territory with American munitions. In response, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Western countries \u201csupplying weapons to a conflict zone is always a bad thing.\u201d \u201cIn the end, if we see that these countries become involved in a war against us, what they are doing makes them directly involved in a war against the Russian Federation, we reserve the right to act the same way,\u201d Putin said on Wednesday. Putin added that as a response, \u201cwe will improve our air defense systems to destroy the missiles.\u201d He also asked why Russia would \u201cnot have the right to supply our weapons of the same class to those regions of the world where there will be strikes on the sensitive facilities of those countries that are doing this against Russia?\u201d \u2018No direct threat\u2019 Russia\u2019s military is expected to increase its naval and air activity near the United States this summer as part of routine maneuvers in the lead up to a global naval exercise in the fall, according to the US State Department and the Pentagon. \u201cRussia is likely to send combat naval vessels to the Caribbean, with potential port calls in Cuba and possibly Venezuela,\u201d Pentagon spokesperson Maj. Charlie Dietz said on Thursday. \u201cAircraft deployments or flights in the region are also anticipated. These deployments are part of Russia\u2019s routine naval operations and pose no direct threat to the United States.\u201d Alongside Russian ships this summer will also be one of the Russian Navy\u2019s Severodvinsk II-class submarines, Dietz said. The port call for that submarine was approved \u201cat least in part due to Havana\u2019s displeasure\u201d over the visit of a US nuclear submarine to the US\u2019 Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba last year, he said. Cuba has hosted Russian ships every year between 2013 and 2020, Dietz said, adding that the exercises \u201cimpose a significant cost on the Russian Navy, which faces challenges in maintaining readiness and conducting deployments with an aging fleet.\u201d \u201cGiven Russia\u2019s long history of Cuban port calls, these are considered routine naval visits, especially in the context of increased US support to Ukraine and NATO exercises,\u201d Dietz said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/americas/cuba-russian-ships-submarine-visit-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_middleeast_analysis-yahya-sinwar-hamas-ceasefire-talks-intl-latam", "text": "Yahya Sinwar has so far survived eight months of Israeli\u2019s brutal military campaign to kill him.\u00a0His longevity\u00a0is a personal victory for the Hamas leader \u2013 and increasingly appears to be grim vindication of his decision to seize the initiative in the generational Palestinian struggle with Israel\u00a0by\u00a0launching a bloody attack\u00a0on October 7 that would plunge Gaza\u2019s two million residents into a predictable hell. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and his military responded\u00a0as expected\u00a0to Sinwar\u2019s\u00a0onslaught\u00a0of terror\u00a0that killed more than 1,200\u00a0people and saw over 220 taken hostage, declaring war and vowing to destroy Hamas. Predictably too, according to many regional diplomats,\u00a0Israel\u2019s military campaign is\u00a0failing to deliver\u00a0on the dismantling of Hamas, even as the number of Palestinians killed soars past 36,000. While Hamas is people and structures, they argue, it is also an ideology. Now\u00a0Sinwar\u00a0\u2013 who speaks fluent Hebrew and has a nuanced knowledge of Israeli politics \u2013 believes he still has the war\u2019s initiative,\u00a0amid high-stakes bargaining with Israel for a ceasefire and hostage deal. \u201cWe have the Israelis right where we want them,\u201d\u00a0he is said to have told other Hamas leaders, in leaked messages reported by The Wall Street Journal. He appeared to justify the deaths of Palestinian civilians as a \u201cnecessary sacrifice\u201d according to the messages. If this were a conventional war, it would be easy to write Sinwar off as deluded; Israel has the upper hand by far in conventional weapons. But\u00a0the weapons\u2019\u00a0devastating effectiveness is becoming\u00a0a liability\u00a0in this asymmetric conflict, and against the backdrop of a\u00a0tortured history\u00a0that\u00a0Sinwar\u00a0is\u00a0adroitly weaponizing against Israel. Because of the enormous civilian casualties and suffering inflicted by Israel in its pursuit of Hamas, Netanyahu now faces a possible arrest warrant for war crimes from the ICC, the world\u2019s top court\u00a0\u2013 just like\u00a0Sinwar.\u00a0And\u00a0the consequences for Netanyahu are far more serious than for Hamas\u2019 leader, because Sinwar is already a renowned terrorist hiding in a tunnel with limited prospects and Netanyahu is a global leader whose world will dramatically shrink if the ICC issues warrants. Netanyahu dismisses the ICC as anti-Semitic, but\u00a0that hasn\u2019t neutralized the damage in the court of international opinion.\u00a0Meanwhile,\u00a0Sinwar\u00a0can sit back and cash in\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0international\u00a0anger\u00a0over\u00a0Palestinian suffering. Wind in Sinwar\u2019s sails Earlier this year,\u00a0university campuses\u00a0across the United States and Europe\u00a0combusted in spontaneous protest over\u00a0the toll of Israel\u2019s war on\u00a0civilians\u00a0in Gaza,\u00a0where humanitarians warn of a growing hunger crisis. For the first time, a generation of Palestinian were able to witness what they\u2019d always hoped for, a potent political\u00a0force\u00a0able to rival what they\u2019ve always perceived as an over loud, over pervasive and over powerful lobby\u00a0for Israeli interests. In any other year this may have been irrelevant, but Biden\u2019s back is to the wall in the upcoming US presidential election. He\u00a0has pledged unwavering support to Israel and continues to send weapons to Israel\u2019s military, but if he stays the course, Biden\u00a0risks losing vital votes in swing states from a new generation of left-leaning Democrats. He can\u2019t ignore the protesters\u2019 anger about Gaza\u2019s plight. This puts\u00a0wind in Sinwar\u2019s political sails. His negotiating team\u00a0has\u00a0gotten\u00a0tougher:\u00a0first\u00a0appearing\u00a0to be on\u00a0the verge of compromise, then holding out for a permanent ceasefire and complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. He also appears to have brought the reality of a Palestinian state closer too \u2013 a\u00a0political\u00a0coup following decades of stultifying inertia. US regional allies, notably Saudi Arabia, have set an \u201cirreversible\u201d path to a two-state solution as part of their price for buy-in to help Gaza rebuild. And while Netanyahu\u2019s far-right ministers predictably say no\u00a0to Palestinian statehood, some\u00a0Western\u00a0partners are\u00a0showing\u00a0they\u2019re fed up\u00a0with Israeli intransigence. In recent weeks, Ireland, Spain, Norway and Portugal, all frustrated Netanyahu won\u2019t agree a peace deal, have\u00a0formally\u00a0recognized Palestinian\u00a0statehood.\u00a0The statements\u00a0mark a remarkable departure\u00a0from\u00a0their previously cautious approach to Netanyahu\u2019s belligerence. Israel\u00a0has lashed out\u00a0against the four\u00a0European nations, but this doesn\u2019t sting Sinwar. He is able to hunker down deep below Gaza and relish the hell he has unleashed above and the repercussions he gambled on. Hamas\u2019s ideology thrives under the\u00a0current\u00a0Israeli attacks, precisely because it was born of, and nurtured on, that very\u00a0narrative.\u00a0The war\u00a0Sinwar\u00a0started\u00a0has taken\u00a0Palestinian\u00a0suffering to the next level\u00a0\u2013 and Netanyahu has played right into it. None of this means Sinwar will be winning a popular vote in Gaza during his lifetime, however long or short that may be. But the\u00a0enormous\u00a0bloodshed he precipitated has allowed him to tap into global moral outrage. He is\u00a0now\u00a0playing the Democratic world against itself,\u00a0and\u00a0his tools are the very\u00a0values\u00a0that\u00a0developed nations hold sacrosanct: sanctity of life and fair play. From a position of apparent weakness, he tries to turn every apparent disadvantage to advantage. On the cusp of Israel\u2019s imminent Rafah operation, he tried to stall it by claiming to accept an Egyptian peace deal\u00a0that\u00a0he said Israel had accepted \u2013 with his officials briefing details of the mechanics and timings of how hostage releases would work. As expected,\u00a0the tactic\u00a0spun up already febrile Israeli street protest against Netanyahu to a new level. Demonstrators demanded Netanyahu forestall the Rafah operation in favor of a seemingly tantalizingly close hostage release deal. Who\u2019s calling the shots in Gaza According to regional diplomats,\u00a0many\u00a0of Sinwar\u2019s power plays were entirely predictable. Decades of Israeli failure to address Palestinians\u2019 security and economic concerns outside of Israel\u2019s perceived interests set the table for Sinwar\u2019s challenge, and what he could expect to achieve. Sinwar\u2019s\u00a0power\u00a0amid the war\u00a0seems to be becoming part of the perceived wisdom about Gaza and the war. In Israel on Tuesday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said, \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone other than the Hamas leadership in Gaza actually are the ones who can make decisions.\u201d Even if Sinwar were\u00a0inclined\u00a0to solicit input from Hamas\u2019s well-heeled leadership cadre sitting in the comfort of Doha,\u00a0and\u00a0meeting leaders in Iran and Turkey, the likelihood they can bridge the gaps in their thinking\u00a0through\u00a0detailed discussion is almost nil.\u00a0Unfettered communication away from Israel\u2019s prying ears and eyes\u00a0is\u00a0impossible. In the final days before Northern Ireland\u2019s momentous 1998 Good Friday Peace Agreement between the IRA\u2019s political wing Sinn\u00a0Fein and the British government, I watched the group\u2019s top leaders emerge from the talks locked in intense, semi-silent conspiratorial whispers, slowly pacing adjacent gardens. But such conversations are likely a luxury Sinwar neither has, nor dares risk taking,\u00a0from wherever he is hiding in Gaza. And\u00a0like any leader convinced he is proving his point, he is unlikely to back down now\u00a0unless his key demands are locked in. His recent warning\u00a0that\u00a0Israel will have to fight for Rafah strongly suggest he is still in the process of bargaining. Blinken didn\u2019t mention Sinwar by name in his remarks Tuesday, but there was no need. Everyone in the room understood who he meant when he added, \u201cThat is what we are waiting on.\u201d And if messages of pressure to make a deal are reaching Sinwar he will also understand them for\u00a0another part of what they are \u2013 an\u00a0attempt\u00a0to turn Gazans\u00a0desperate for an end to the conflict\u00a0against him. As much as Sinwar has put the psychological screws on Israel\u2019s\u00a0leadership, he can be made vulnerable too.\u00a0And if\u00a0past experience is any measure, he will likely gamble\u00a0that\u00a0he can play mind games better than Netanyahu.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/middleeast/analysis-yahya-sinwar-hamas-ceasefire-talks-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_middleeast_sinwar-hamas-israel-ceasefire-hostage-talks-intl", "text": "The military leader of Hamas has said he believes he has gained the upper hand over Israel and that the spiralling civilian death toll in Gaza would work in the militant group\u2019s favor, according to a\u00a0report by the Wall Street Journal, citing leaked messages the newspaper\u00a0said it had seen. \u201cWe have the Israelis right where we want them,\u201d Yahya Sinwar told\u00a0other\u00a0Hamas leaders\u00a0recently, according to one of the messages, the WSJ reported Monday. In another, Sinwar is said to have described civilian deaths as \u201cnecessary sacrifices\u201d while citing past independence-related conflicts in countries like Algeria. The WSJ said it reviewed dozens of messages sent to ceasefire negotiators from Sinwar, who has not been seen in public since Hamas\u2019s October 7 attack on Israel left 1,200 people dead and another 250 taken hostage. The ensuing Israeli assault aimed at eliminating the group has killed more than 37,000 Palestinians in the strip, according to health authorities there. Sinwar\u2019s whereabouts are unknown but he is assumed to be hiding deep underground in Hamas\u2019 labyrinthine tunnel system below Gaza. The messages reported by the WSJ offer a rare glimpse into the mind of the man steering Hamas\u2019 thinking on the war and suggest an uncompromising determination to continue fighting, regardless of the human cost. In another exchange that took place as Israel\u00a0set a deadline\u00a0in February to enter Rafah before the Muslim month of Ramadan, the WSJ reported that Sinwar urged Hamas\u2019 political leaders not to make concessions and instead push for a permanent end to the war,\u00a0adding that high civilian casualties would ramp up global pressure on Israel to halt the conflict. \u201cIsrael\u2019s journey in Rafah won\u2019t be a walk in the park,\u201d Sinwar allegedly said in a message to the Hamas political leadership. CNN has not seen the leaked messages viewed by the WSJ and is not able to confirm the authenticity of the communications. Commenting on the WSJ report, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said on X: \u201cSinwar\u00a0profits off the deaths of Gazan civilians, calling them \u201cnecessary sacrifices\u201d in order to urge international pressure on Israel\u2019s efforts to eliminate his terrorist organization.\u201d Mediators are waiting for a Hamas response to an\u00a0Israeli proposal presented\u00a0by US President Joe Biden last month, which aims to release the hostages in Gaza and implement a lasting ceasefire there. \u2018Waiting on\u2019 Sinwar Sinwar\u2019s alleged comments emerged as US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was on another tour through the Middle East to push all sides to agree to the latest proposal. Speaking from Tel Aviv on Tuesday, Blinken made it clear that the US believes Sinwar is the ultimate decision-maker. \u201cI think there are there those who have influenced, but influence is one thing, actually getting a decision made is the is another thing. I don\u2019t think anyone other than the Hamas leadership in Gaza actually are the ones who can make decisions,\u201d Blinken said, adding that \u201cthat is what we are waiting on.\u201d Blinken said that Hamas\u2019 answer to the proposal will reveal the group\u2019s priorities. \u201cWe await the answer from Hamas in and that will speak volumes about what they want, what they\u2019re looking for, who they\u2019re looking after,\u201d Blinken said. \u201cAre they looking after one guy who may be for now safe \u2026 I don\u2019t know, 10 stories underground somewhere in Gaza, while the people that he purports to represent continue to suffer in a crossfire of his own making? Or will he do what\u2019s necessary to actually move this to a better place, to help end the suffering of people to help bring real security to Israelis and Palestinians alike.\u201d In early messages to ceasefire negotiators, Sinwar seemed \u201csurprised\u201d by the brutality of the October 7 attack on Israel. \u201cThings went out of control,\u201d Sinwar said in one of his messages, according to the WSJ, adding he was \u201creferring to gangs taking civilian women and children as hostages.\u201d \u201cPeople got caught up in this, and that should not have happened,\u201d Sinwar said, according to the WSJ. The US-designated terrorist had also expressed discontent after not being consulted for a meeting between the Hamas political leaders with other Palestinian factions, calling the meeting \u201cshameful and outrageous.\u201d \u201cAs long as fighters are still standing and we have not lost the war, such contacts should be immediately terminated,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cwe have the capabilities to continue fighting for months.\u201d He had also compared the war in Gaza to a 7th-century battle in Karbala, Iraq, a monumental moment in Islamic history where the grandson of the Prophet Mohammed was killed. \u201cWe have to move forward on the same path we started,\u201d Sinwar reportedly wrote. \u201cOr let it be a new Karbala.\u201d On Monday,\u00a014 of the 15 United Nations Security Council\u00a0members voted in favor of a US-drafted resolution around the latest ceasefire proposal, with only Russia abstaining \u2013 the first time the council has endorsed such a plan to end the war. Israel is not a member of the UNSC, and so did not vote. The comprehensive three-stage peace deal, which sets out conditions intended to lead to the eventual release of all remaining hostages, in return for a permanent ceasefire and withdrawal of Israeli forces, was first laid out publicly by US President Biden on May 31. The landmark vote means the UNSC now joins other major global bodies in backing the plan, increasing international pressure on both Hamas and Israel to end the conflict. Hamas welcomed the adoption of the UNSC resolution, saying in a statement it was ready to engage with mediators to implement measures such as the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, prisoner exchange, returning residents to their homes and the \u201crejection of any demographic change or reduction in the area of the Gaza Strip.\u201d The resolution says Israel has accepted the plan, and US officials have repeatedly emphasized Israel had agreed to the proposal \u2013 despite other public comments from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that suggest otherwise.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/middleeast/sinwar-hamas-israel-ceasefire-hostage-talks-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "world"}}

Authorities identified the suspect only by his last name, Cui, who was describes as a 55-year-old man from the city\u2019s Longtan District. Police said he \u201ccollided with a foreigner while walking\u201d in Beishan Park, a popular green space\u00a0in the city center. The suspect then stabbed the instructors, as well as a Chinese tourist who stepped forward and tried to stop him during the incident, police said in a statement. Police said they received the call around 11:49 a.m. local time Monday, after which they dispatched officers to the scene and transported the injured to the hospital for treatment. The injured \u201chave all received proper medical treatment and are not in danger \u2026\u201d police said earlier. The educators from Cornell College, a private liberal arts college\u00a0in Mount Vernon, Iowa, were wounded \u201cin a serious incident\u201d\u00a0on Monday, while participating in a partnership program with Beihua University in Jilin, according to the college. \u201cWe have been in contact with all four instructors and are assisting them during this time,\u201d Cornell College President Jonathan Brand said in a statement, adding no students took part in the program. Footage purportedly showing the aftermath of the daylight attack emerged on Chinese social media on Monday but was swiftly censored. It showed two men and a woman lying on the ground covered in large blood stains, surrounded by onlookers. They appeared conscious and were talking on their cell phones, the video showed. CNN geolocated the video to Beishan Park, a popular green space\u00a0in Jilin city center, less than half an hour\u2019s drive from Beihua University. Monday was a public holiday in China. China\u2019s Foreign Ministry confirmed Tuesday that \u201cfour foreign teachers at Beihua University were attacked\u201d while visiting the park Monday morning \u2013 adding they were immediately taken to the hospital and did not suffer life-threatening injuries. Iowa state Rep. Adam Zabner told CNN his brother, David Zabner, was one of the victims of the stabbing. Zabner said his brother, who was on his second visit to China with Cornell, is \u201cdoing well\u201d and has \u201cbeen stitched up and seems to be recovering,\u201d after speaking to him on Tuesday morning Beijing time. The other three victims survived the attack, Adam Zabner said, adding he could not comment on their health status. \u201cI\u2019m just extremely grateful that my brother is OK and that he survived this attack,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cThe hope of my family is to get my brother back home as soon as possible and get them healthy. And we really just want to thank the US State Department for all their help, and also our federal delegation from Iowa who have been particularly helpful.\u201d The US State Department said it was aware of reports of a stabbing incident in China and is monitoring the situation. \u2018Horrifying attack\u2019 Knife attacks are not uncommon in China, where guns are tightly controlled. The country has faced a spate of stabbing rampages in public places including schools and hospitals. But public attacks against foreigners are rare. The attack in Jilin comes as China has been seeking to draw back international visitors following three years of stringent Covid-19 border controls. It also comes amid efforts to boost educational exchanges with the United States as the two countries look to stabilize their fraught relationship. The incident has drawn attention and concern in Iowa from officials and lawmakers. Gov. Kim Reynolds called it a \u201chorrifying attack.\u201d US Rep. Ashley Hinson, who represents the district where Cornell College is located, said the college employees \u201cwere brutally stabbed\u201d and vowed to \u201cdo everything in our power to bring these Iowans home safely.\u201d On China\u2019s heavily censored social media, visuals and discussions about the attack had been swiftly erased since Monday. Censorship appeared to have relaxed somewhat by noon Tuesday to allow some comments to surface. Some Chinese internet users called it a \u201cterrible\u201d incident, while others questioned why Chinese media was not reporting on the attack. Some also expressed concerns about its potential impact on China\u2019s global image and the willingness of foreigners to visit the country, amid a rise in nationalism and anti-American sentiment. At its news conference Tuesday, China\u2019s Foreign Ministry sought to dismiss concerns that the attack would affect educational exchanges between China and the US. \u201cCarrying out people-to-people and cultural exchanges between China and the United States is in the common interests of both sides and has received active support and response from various sectors in both countries,\u201d said Lin, the spokesperson. \u201cChina is widely recognized as one of the safest countries in the world. China has always taken effective measures and will continue to take relevant measures to effectively protect the safety of all foreigners in China.\u201d Study ties Cornell College began a partnership with Beihua University in 2018, which would see the Chinese institution provide funding for educators from the Iowa school to travel and live in China and teach a portion of a course in areas of computer science, math and physics over two-week periods, according to information posted on the college website at the time. China has been trying to boost its educational cooperation with the US, which has suffered considerable setbacks due to the Covid pandemic and bilateral tensions. During a visit to the US in November, Chinese leader Xi Jinping announced the country would invite 50,000 young Americans to China on exchange and study programs in the next five years to foster personal ties between the two countries. The Chinese leader noted his own enduring ties to the state of Iowa in his announcement. Xi stayed with a host family in Iowa during his first visit to the US nearly four decades ago, an experience he has described as \u201cunforgettable.\u201d Last week, Xi encouraged universities in China and the US to \u201cstrengthen exchanges and cooperation,\u201d in a letter to the president of Kean University in New Jersey, which has a China-based joint venture with Wenzhou University, according to state media. China has one of the lowest rates of violent crime in the world, partly due to its strict gun controls and powerful mass surveillance. But it has continued to face mass stabbings in public places. In May, two people were killed and another 21 injured in a knife attack in a hospital in the southwestern province of Yunnan. Last year, six people were killed and one injured in an early morning\u00a0stabbing incident\u00a0outside a kindergarten in southern Guangdong province. And a\u00a02022 stabbing, also at a kindergarten, killed three and injured six in eastern Jiangxi province. Correction: An earlier version of this story reported the wrong day for the stabbings.

{"id": "2024_06_05_europe_putin-russia-western-nations-ukraine-intl-hnk", "text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned Western countries they\u2019re taking a \u201cvery serious and dangerous step\u201d by supplying weapons to Ukraine, which could result in Moscow arming their enemies. Ukraine has relied heavily on arms supplied by Western allies to beat back Russian forces since Putin\u2019s full-scale invasion began more than two years ago. And last week, US President Joe Biden for the first time gave Kyiv permission to use American munitions to carry out limited strikes inside Russian territory, after several European nations removed restrictions on how weapons they supply can be used. \u201cSupplying weapons to a conflict zone is always a bad thing,\u201d Putin told editors from international news agencies on the sidelines of the annual economic forum in St. Petersburg on Wednesday. \u201cEspecially if this is linked to the fact that those who supply them are not only delivering weapons but managing them.\u201d Putin also warned that Russia could retaliate if Western countries are deemed to have become directly involved in the Ukraine conflict. \u201cIn the end, if we see that these countries become involved in a war against us, what they are doing makes them directly involved in a war against the Russian Federation, we reserve the right to act the same way,\u201d he said. \u201cOverall, it leads to some serious problems.\u201d And he raised the prospect of retaliatory action\u00a0by asking why Russia would \u201cnot have the right to supply our weapons of the same class to those regions of the world where there will be strikes on the sensitive facilities of those countries that are doing this against Russia?\u201d The Ukrainian military has started using US-supplied HIMARS rocket systems to hit Russian air defense systems, weapons depots and other military targets\u00a0on Russian territory, a member of the Ukrainian Parliament told CNN on Wednesday. Yehor Cherniev, deputy chairman of the Ukrainian Parliament\u2019s Committee on National Security, Defense and Intelligence,\u00a0said the American weapons had allowed them \u201cto significantly reduce the shelling of Kharkiv by Russian S-300 missiles.\u201d In his comments Wednesday, Putin said Russia would improve air defense systems to destroy incoming missiles. He also singled out Berlin for criticism, following remarks last week from the leaders of France and Germany that Ukraine should be allowed to use their weapons against targets inside Russia from which Moscow attacks Ukraine. The appearance of German tanks in Ukraine had resulted in an \u201cethical shock\u201d in Russia, where the attitude toward Germany had previously been \u201cvery good,\u201d Putin said. \u201cNow, when they say that some more missiles will appear that will strike targets on Russian territory, this, of course, is ultimately destroying Russo-German relations,\u201d he added. Speaking alongside French President Emmanuel Macron on May 28, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Ukraine was allowed to defend itself as long as it respected the conditions given by the countries that supplied the weapons \u2013 including the United States \u2013 and international law. \u201cUkraine has every possibility under international law for what it is doing. That has to be said explicitly,\u201d Scholz said. \u201cI find it strange when some people argue that it should not be allowed to defend itself and take measures that are suitable for this.\u201d Ukraine had for months pleaded with Washington to allow it to strike targets on Russian soil with US weapons, as Moscow launched a brutal aerial and ground assault on Kharkiv, knowing that its troops could retreat to Russian soil to regroup and its weapons depots could not be targeted with Western arms. The US is standing firm in not allowing Ukraine to use the most formidable munition it has been given to fire into Russia: the long-range missiles known as ATACMS that can hit targets 300 kilometers (nearly 200 miles) away. Instead, Ukraine can only use shorter-range missiles known as GMLRS, which have a range of around 70 kilometers (around 40 miles).", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/europe/putin-russia-western-nations-ukraine-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "world_africa_bananas-artificial-hair-cheverux-organique-spc", "text": "During a visit to a local farm while working with development agency USAID, Ugandan entrepreneur Juliet Tumusiime realized that a huge amount of banana stems are left over from banana cultivation and simply discarded. Looking for a way to use the waste, she struck upon an innovative business idea. Almost a decade later, now aged 42, Tumusiime is the chief executive and co-founder of Cheveux Organique, which manufactures hair made from banana fibers as an alternative to synthetic extensions. Fashion trends among the younger population and growing purchasing power have boosted the market for hair extensions and wigs in the Africa and the Middle East, which could be worth $710 million by 2028, according to Research and Markets. Extensions are typically made from human hair, or synthetic materials such as nylon, polyester, acrylic and PVC. Synthetics are popular in Uganda because they\u2019re much cheaper, but they\u2019re not biodegradable or easy to recycle. Some people complain that synthetic hair can irritate their scalp and a study of synthetic hair in Nigeria found the presence of potentially harmful heavy metals and chemicals. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to friends, colleagues, both men and women and asked them how they dispose of their hair when they take it out,\u201d Tumusiime says. \u201cA lot of the time it is just thrown in the trash. The level of awareness is really low - most people don\u2019t realize that they are wearing plastic on their head which can irritate the skin and cause pollution. \u201cOur mission is to transform the beauty industry by providing alternatives that benefit their health and the environment. We want to empower women to make informed decisions about what hair they use and what\u2019s best for them.\u201d Tumusiime says that, unlike synthetic hair, her product is biodegradable, durable and can be easily styled, treated and colored. It can also be rewashed with warm water and conditioned with detangling cream. When dry, the hypoallergenic hair can be oiled and can withstand dryers and heat up to 400 degrees, lasting weeks longer than synthetic alternatives, according to Tumusiime. Since it\u2019s made from discarded banana stems, she adds, it\u2019s also a way to help curb that waste. Uganda is Africa\u2019s largest producer and consumer of bananas, producing about 10 million metric tons of bananas per day. Ugandans consume almost one kilogram of the fruit per person, per day, with more than 75% of the population relying on bananas as a staple food, according to the World Economic Forum. Cheveux Organique works closely with local banana farmers, buying stems that would otherwise be discarded. The stems are split and the fibers extracted by machine. The extracted fibers are then dried and treated, before being combed out, resulting in the hair-like texture. The \u201chair\u201d is dyed into three shades: Cheveux Black, Cheveux Brown and Cheveux Blonde. Tumusiime says it has a natural sheen, is soft to the touch and can be used for braiding and styling. It\u2019s also suitable for warm and humid climates, she notes. The company isn\u2019t unique in creating plant-based hair. In the US, St.Louis-based Rebundle also sells hair extensions made from banana fibers, while Nourie Hair offers a hair alternative for braiding made from Ginseng root extract and rosemary. However, turning banana waste into a premium product does not come without challenges for Cheveux Organique. \u201cThe labor-intensive process, from picking the stems, transporting them to the facility, extracting the stems, treating them and the power needed to use this \u2013 it causes the product to become pricey,\u201d Tumusiime says. Cheveux Organique sells its plant-based hair in Uganda, and as fair afield as the US, France and the UK. It retails for $50 for 150 grams (5.3 ounces), which Tumusiime says is cheaper than a typical $185 for a similar amount of human hair. But synthetic hair can be bought for as little as $1 for a bundle. \u201cThis is something that we are hugely concerned about, and we are trying to find ways to mechanize the business and produce volumes of hair whilst continuing to break even,\u201d Tumusiime says. \u201cThe people paying these prices are getting a premium product at the end of it \u2013 and it\u2019s about the long-term benefits that this product brings.\u201d Tumusiime says her startup, which currently employs 25 permanent staff members and 100 part-time workers for waste gathering, is in the process of creating regional hubs, which will function as extraction centers, as well as an education point for young people.

{"id": "2024_06_09_middleeast_analysis-gantz-resigns-intl-latam", "text": "Gone from the war cabinet. Gone from the government. Benny Gantz is back where he was at the start of the war Hamas launched on October 7: an ex-defence minister, ex chief of staff \u2013 and Prime Minister Benjamin (Bibi) Netanyahu\u2019s chief political rival. You can\u2019t say he didn\u2019t warn us. On May 18, he announced that if Netanyahu didn\u2019t come up with a coherent plan to bring the hostages home and the governance of a post-war Gaza (among other things), then he\u2019d leave the war cabinet by June 8. In light of Saturday\u2019s rescue of four Israeli hostages, he delayed making good on his threat. By a day. \u201cLeaving the government is a complex and painful decision,\u201d Gantz said in a televised statement on Sunday evening in Israel. \u201cNetanyahu prevents us from moving forward to a real victory [in Gaza]. That is why we are leaving the emergency government today with a heavy heart, but with a whole heart.\u201d So what now? The three most pressing areas of interest where Gantz\u2019s resignation may be felt \u2013 at least for Israelis, the Palestinians in Gaza, and the outside world \u2013 are the Israeli government, the running of the war with Hamas, and Gantz\u2019s own political prospects. Perhaps the most important impact of Gantz\u2019s departure is the one it won\u2019t have: it\u00a0won\u2019t\u00a0cause the government to collapse. \u201cBenny Gantz is in a fix,\u201d former Middle East negotiator Aaron David Miller told CNN on Sunday before Gantz\u2019s resignation. \u201cHe would like to remain in the government, he brings a sort of moderating hand, but he does not have the potential right now to down the government.\u201d That\u2019s because Netanyahu and his coalition partners still have 64 of the Knesset\u2019s 120 seats. So unless US President Joe Biden\u2019s \u2013 sorry, Israel\u2019s \u2013 hostage deal gets done, and Netanyahu\u2019s far-right ministers make good on\u00a0their\u00a0threats to leave the government at what they say they\u2019d see as Israel\u2019s surrender to Hamas, then Netanyahu could safely stay in office till elections are due in October 2026 (opinion polls suggest that if they were held now, Gantz would win). For the Palestinians in Gaza, a Gantz-free government means that at best, things won\u2019t get any worse. The \u201cmoderating\u201d hand of Gantz to which Miller refers seems unlikely to have resulted in Israel going any \u201ceasier\u201d on Hamas, or causing fewer civilian casualties than have occurred. Gantz is no dove. Nor for that matter is the third member of the war cabinet, Defence Minister Yoav Gallant. But both Gantz and Gallant have no qualms about disagreeing publicly with Netanyahu (Gantz once agreed to rotate the prime ministership with Netanyahu, only for the latter to prevent the budget passing so the government would collapse and Gantz wouldn\u2019t get his turn as PM; Gallant was sacked and then unsacked last year, after calling on Netanyahu to pause his contentious judicial overhaul). And so if a hostage deal that were acceptable to them \u2013 but which might cause Netanyahu\u2019s coalition partners to bolt\u00a0instead \u2013 appeared on the table, only for Bibi to block it for personal reasons, they might have been able to\u00a0call him out. With Gantz gone, that\u00a0seems less likely \u2013 as does the\u00a0likelihood of a hostage deal being consummated any time soon.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/09/middleeast/analysis-gantz-resigns-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "world"}}

While protracted military detention has decreased recently, the report\u00a0released Monday\u00a0noted that many women still experienced mistreatment. Titled, \u201c\u2018Help us build our lives\u2019: Girl Survivors of Boko Haram and Military Abuses in Northeast Nigeria,\u201d it probes how girls and young women have been abducted, forced into marriage, and subjected to sexual violence by Boko Haram. Survivors recounted giving birth to children fathered by Boko Haram fighters, often when they were still minors themselves. One young woman revealed that she twice witnessed Boko Haram members execute women who had taken contraceptive pills. Based on 126 interviews with women and girls aged between 12 and 48 years old,\u00a0including 82 who survived being abused while children,\u00a0the report details the atrocities carried out by Boko Haram.\u00a0The interviews were conducted between 2019 and 2024 in northeast Nigeria, with the majority undertaken in the past year. Amnesty\u00a0has contacted several global partners about its findings, including the office of the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, urging it to investigate\u00a0\u201ccrimes under international law committed by all parties during the conflict in north-east Nigeria.\u201d Amnesty\u00a0researchers say they spoke to nearly 50 girls and young women who escaped Boko Haram\u00a0and found their way to government-held territory, risking their lives\u00a0and those of their children\u00a0in the process. However, their horrific experiences at the hands of their captors were further compounded by the hardship they faced once they regained their freedom. \u00a0\u201cThese girls, many of whom are now young women, had their childhood stolen from them and suffered a litany of war crimes and other human rights abuses. They are now showing remarkable bravery as they seek to take control of their future,\u201d said Samira Daoud, Amnesty\u00a0International\u2019s regional director for West and Central Africa. \u2018Wives of Boko Haram\u2019 Among the 126, the Amnesty\u00a0team spoke to 31 girls and young women who described being unlawfully imprisoned in military custody between 2015 and mid-2023 for periods ranging from a few days to over four years, accused of having allegiances with Boko Haram. They described being humiliated by soldiers who called them \u201cwives of Boko Haram\u201d and accused them of being behind killings carried out by the terror group. Several told Amnesty\u00a0researchers of enduring beatings while detained by the military. One of them, named NV in the report, said she fled Boko Haram in 2021 when she was around 20. She said she was held for two months in Madagali, Adamawa State, by soldiers. NV said: \u201cWhen they [soldiers] brought food\u2026 they gave us a portion in our hand and soup in one bowl for all of us to share\u2026 As a toilet, they gave us a plastic bag.\u201d Another, called GN in the report, said Nigerian soldiers detained her after they raided the camp where she and others were held by Boko Haram, before being taken to an internally displaced persons (IDP) camp.\u00a0She had been forcibly married to a Boko Haram fighter while in captivity but remarried while living in the IDP for an extended period. She\u00a0later\u00a0received a call from her Boko Haram \u201chusband\u201d asking her to come back to him, which aroused suspicion from a neighbor who reported her to security forces, GN said. \u201cNigerian soldiers detained her in Bama Prison for around one month in the second half of 2021 and beat her with a cane for three days. She was pregnant at the time. The soldiers blindfolded her and transferred her to Giwa Barracks in Maiduguri. GN was unlawfully detained there for around one year, during which she gave birth,\u201d the report stated. By the time she regained her freedom, her Boko Haram \u201chusband\u201d had sued her and her new husband in sharia (Islamic) court and they were ordered to pay him money, it added. Amnesty\u00a0International said it had communicated its findings to Nigerian federal and state authorities. In response, the Nigerian Defense Headquarters in a statement sent to CNN Monday said the Armed Forces of Nigeria AFN \u201cmakes it unequivocally clear that, it is a professional military force that operates within the ambit of International law of armed conflict.\u201d Adding that it would encourage Amnesty \u201cto approach the military high command to substantiate their allegations. The military has self regulating mechanisms with which it administers the military justice system to address any proven case of misconduct of personnel.\u201d CNN has contacted the\u00a0Nigerian Army and the Borno State authorities for comment on the allegations. The\u00a0Borno State government, under an initiative to reintegrate fleeing and surrendered Boko Haram fighters, gave reassurances that they would not be prosecuted but allowed to stay with their families, including their wives, according to the report. \u201cBorno State Governor Babagana Zulum promised that Boko Haram fighters would not be handed over to the military and would be provided with services and allowed to stay with their families, including their \u2018wives,\u2019\u201d the report said. When Amnesty asked girls and young women about the screening process conducted by the military or government authorities after they had exited Boko Haram, \u201cnone of the interviewees said they were asked whether they had married or joined Boko Haram freely.\u201d This failure to attempt to identify victims of forced marriage or trafficking makes it even harder for the women and girls to access the support they are entitled to, the report said. A decade-long reign of terror Since 2009, the armed Islamist group\u00a0Boko Haram\u00a0has waged an insurgency estimated to have killed more than 35,000 people and displaced two million people in the country\u2019s northeast, according to the UN. During a reign of terror that spanned more than a decade, Boko Haram launched attacks on families in the northeast of Nigeria, with tactics including\u00a0\u201csuicide bombings, abductions, torture, rape, forced marriages, and recruitment of child soldiers,\u201d according to the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect. One of Boko Haram\u2019s most notorious abductions was the kidnapping of the Chibok schoolgirls in 2014, when nearly 300 students were taken from their school in Chibok, Borno State. This event prompted global outrage and spotlighted the insurgent group\u2019s brutal tactics. Since the Chibok abductions, many more girls have been abducted; most of them were forced into marriage. According to the report, Boko Haram engages in child and forced marriage. The interviewees described harsh treatment and public punishments and at least 31 girls told Amnesty\u00a0researchers they were forced to witness lashings, amputations, and beheadings. One girl referred to as GH in the report, was held captive for about 10 years. She recounted often being forced to watch violent punishments.\u00a0\u201cSometimes I dream about the corpses that I saw or the stoning of the women that I saw. Once I open my eyes, I can\u2019t go back to sleep again,\u201d she\u00a0said in the report. Many\u00a0survivors of Boko Haram\u00a0told Amnesty\u00a0that they witnessed Boko Haram killing their relatives. One\u00a0young woman, named as\u00a0CB\u00a0in the report,\u00a0said she was abducted at around\u00a0age\u00a013 in 2014. \u201cOne day, Boko Haram \u2026 came into our house. They told our father we were non-believers. They shot my father in the back of his head, and the bullet came through his eyes. We started crying. They said if we\u00a0don\u2019t\u00a0keep quiet, they\u00a0will\u00a0kill my mother too,\u201d she told researchers. Kidnapped girls were also forced into sexual slavery and domestic servitude as \u201cwives,\u201d with at least 33 survivors telling Amnesty\u00a0they were raped by the men they were forced to marry. One teenager, named as HA in the Amnesty\u00a0report, said she agreed\u00a0to get married to a Boko Haram militant to save her father\u2019s life. She added that she was frequently raped and beaten\u00a0during the \u201cmarriage,\u201d with other Boko Haram fighters helping her husband as he forced himself on her. Consequently, many of the girls and young women face long-term issues relating to their health,\u00a0have had\u00a0limited access to education, and\u00a0suffer\u00a0stigma from their loved ones and their community. Amnesty\u00a0says the women and girls are speaking out to seek urgent help and support. \u201cThese survivors are overlooked and abandoned. This needs to change \u2026 on their terms and with their active and meaningful participation. Their message must no longer be ignored: \u201cHelp us rebuild our lives.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/africa/boko-haram-nigerian-girls-neglected-amnesty-says-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "world"}}

In a statement, the IDF claimed freed hostages Almog Meir Jan, Andrey Kozlov and Shlomi Ziv were held by journalist Abdallah Aljamal and his family members at their home in the central Gaza camp. The three men, who were kidnapped by Hamas militants from the Nova music festival\u00a0on October 7, were\u00a0rescued after being held captive for 246 days, in an IDF special operation on Saturday along with a fourth hostage, Noa Argamani. There are varying reports on the number of Palestinians killed during the operation. The latest figures from Gazan authorities say 274 Palestinians were killed and 698 injured \u2013 which would mark one of the deadliest days in months for people living in Gaza. The IDF has disputed those numbers, saying it estimated the number of casualties from the operation was \u201cunder 100.\u201d CNN cannot independently verify either side\u2019s figures. Aljamal was killed in the IDF operation along with his wife and father, according to Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor chairman Ramy Abdu, citing initial testimony gathered by the group documenting the IDF\u2019s alleged killings in the Nuseirat camp on Saturday. Aljamal lived on the first floor of a multi-story building, according to Euro-Med. The IDF said the hostages were found on the third floor. CNN is attempting to reach out to people familiar with Aljamal. Israeli claims The IDF statement claimed Aljamal was a Hamas operative and a journalist for\u00a0Al Jazeera. The allegations come a month after Israel expelled the Qatar-based network from the country under a new wartime law that allows the Israeli government to ban foreign media it deems harmful to its security. In a statement Sunday,\u00a0Al Jazeera called Israel\u2019s allegations \u201ccompletely unfounded\u201d and \u201ca continuation of the process of slander and misinformation aimed at harming Al Jazeera\u2019s reputation, professionalism, and independence.\u201d Aljamal never worked for the network but had once contributed to an opinion piece published on its website, Al Jazeera said. Al Jazeera\u2019s website credits Aljamal as the author of an op-ed\u00a0published in 2019. His biography page on the site describes him as a \u201cGaza-based reporter and photojournalist.\u201d Aljamal was a freelance contributor to The Palestine Chronicle, according to the US-based online outlet. The Chronicle said it was saddened by Aljamal\u2019s death, noting his reports \u201chave focused entirely on the humanitarian situation in Gaza.\u201d Meanwhile, an X account linked to Israel\u2019s Foreign Ministry claimed Aljamal was a spokesperson for the Palestinian Ministry of Labor, citing unnamed sources in Gaza. Without providing evidence, the Israeli X account also claimed that Argamani was held in Aljamal\u2019s home, before later saying the three men were held captive there. \u2018Hell on earth\u2019 The Israeli military operation Saturday to free the four hostages took place mid-morning, when the streets were teeming with people shopping at a nearby market. It left a trail of devastation in civilian areas, where the IDF claimed\u00a0Hamas militants were embedded. Residents described the Israeli attack as \u201chell on earth,\u201d with scenes of carnage following the strikes that led up to the rescue. Eyewitnesses described civilians being struck down by airstrikes and shrapnel. Footage from\u00a0the nearby Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital showed trucks and ambulances transferring injured people and bodies to the hospital. Graphic footage shows many Palestinians, including children, injured with blood on their faces and clothes, and the hospital\u2019s emergency room overwhelmed. The four rescued hostages are in \u201cgood medical condition\u201d and are receiving medical attention, according to the IDF. More than 70 hostages held in Gaza since Hamas\u2019 deadly surprise attack on October 7 are believed to be alive.\u00a0Intensive negotiations over a ceasefire and a deal to swap hostages for Palestinian prisoners have stalled recently following months of talks. Hostage freeing operations are extremely rare. More than 100 hostages were freed under a temporary truce last year, while Israel has rescued seven hostages by military means. However, Saturday\u2019s operation shows such operations are still possible and may encourage further efforts from the Israeli military, given a major goal of Israel\u2019s Gaza offensive is to rescue the remaining hostages. In a video address following the operation, IDF spokesperson Rear Adm.\u00a0Daniel Hagari commended Israeli special forces for successfully rescuing the four hostages, and said the military would not lose sight of those still held by Hamas. \u201cWe will not stop fighting for their freedom,\u201d he said. Israel last month pressed ahead with its ground operation in central Rafah despite\u00a0international condemnation\u00a0for its escalation in the southern Gaza city where some\u00a01.3 million Palestinians\u00a0were taking shelter before Israel began its operation there. This is a breaking story\u00a0and will be\u00a0updated.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/middleeast/israel-gaza-hostages-journalist-hamas-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_06_africa_sudanese-government-accuses-militia-massacre-intl", "text": "At least 150 people were killed and 200 injured in an attack by rebel forces in Sudan, local officials and witnesses said, in the latest atrocity in the year-long war that has displaced more than 7 million people. Eyewitnesses told CNN Thursday how fighters from Sudan\u2019s paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) descended upon Wad al-Nour village in the central Al-Jazira state on Wednesday. They described scenes of terror and carnage as over 40 armed vehicles stormed the village, unleashing heavy weaponry on its inhabitants, killing and wounding mostly civilians, among them children and women. Fighting is still ongoing just a few kilometers away, with terrified villagers fearful of further escalations, the witness said. Another eyewitness reported the ongoing grim task of counting the dead and injured. \u201cSo far, we\u2019ve buried more than 120 people in a mass grave in the middle of the village,\u201d he said. CNN cannot independently verify the exact number of casualties. Footage shared on social media Wednesday, and geolocated by CNN, shows a large crowd in Wad Al-Noura village surrounding dozens of dead bodies, shrouded in white, as preparations were being made for their burial. Another video allegedly shows the RSF militia firing heavy and medium weapons towards the village. Both the Sudanese army and the RSF have faced damning accusations of civilian massacres since the civil war broke out in April 2023. The RSF acknowledged the attack in a statement Wednesday and said it was a pre-emptive attack on\u00a0Sudan\u2019s Armed Forces (SAF),\u00a0camps in Wad Al-Noura in response to a planned attack by the army.\u00a0They did not acknowledge the civilian deaths reported. According to the RSF, eight of its fighters were killed, others injured, and they seized vehicles, weapons, and military equipment during the operation. However, eyewitnesses told CNN that there is no military presence in the village, adding that the Sudanese army operates a military base about 30 km (19 miles) southwest of Wad Al-Noura, which is being cited as a possible reason for the attack. CNN has contacted both RSF and the Sudanese Army for comment. The leader of the SAF vowed to retaliate after arriving in a city near the attack where he visited survivors, according to state news agency SUNA. \u201cThe response to the militia\u2019s crimes against the martyrs of [Wad al-Nour] will be severe and harsh,\u201d warned Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, SAF Commander-in-Chief and President of the Sudanese Transitional Sovereignty Council. A strategic target Wad al-Nour village lies about 160 kilometers south of Sudanese capital Khartoum and is now the latest epicenter of violence in a country ravaged by internal conflict. The village has long been a strategic target for the RSF, given its close location to Al-Manaqil, where the Sudanese army maintains its only presence in Al-Jazira state. This was not the first attempt by the RSF to control Wad al-Noura, as they have tried several times to take the village. Thousands have perished since fighting erupted between forces loyal to two rival generals \u2013 army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, leader of the SAF, and General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, head of the RSF. Since the conflict started, both the Sudanese army and the RSF have faced damning accusations of civilian massacres. The RSF has specifically targeted villages in Al-Jazira, Sudan\u2019s agricultural heartland, to swell its ranks through forced conscription and using hunger as a weapon, eyewitnesses have said. In March, eyewitnesses told CNN\u00a0that more than 700 people, including dozens of children, were forcibly recruited from the state by the militia group after being ordered to \u201cenlist or die.\u201d The RSF denied this claim. International outcry and humanitarian crisis The Sudanese Transitional Sovereignty Council condemned the RSF\u2019s actions, describing them as part of a systematic campaign of violence against civilians. \u201cThis heinous crime is added to the series of crimes committed by this rebel militia in many states of Sudan. These are criminal acts that reflect the systematic behavior of these militias in targeting civilians, plundering their property, and forcibly displacing them from their areas,\u201d the Council stated. A UN representative on Thursday expressed deep concern over the reported violence and called for a thorough investigation and accountability for those responsible. \u201cEven by the tragic standards of Sudan\u2019s conflict, the images emerging from Wad Al-Noura are heart-breaking. Wars have rules that need to be respected, no matter what,\u201d UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Sudan Clementine Nkweta-Salami said. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) has warned that \u201cthe number of people displaced by conflict inside Sudan could top 10 million in the coming days.\u201d \u201cThe world\u2019s worst internal displacement crisis continues to escalate, with looming famine and disease adding to the havoc wrought by conflict,\u201d IOM said in a statement on Thursday. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs noted that over 8.8 million people have fled their homes, and 24.8 million urgently need assistance. Last week at the UN Security Council, Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide Alice Wairimu Nderitu warned, \u201cThe situation today bears all the marks of risk of genocide, with strong allegations that this crime has already been committed.\u201d CNN\u2019s Avery Schmitz contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/africa/sudanese-government-accuses-militia-massacre-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_06_11_weather_florida-flooding-hurricane-season-climate", "text": "Flood concerns are rising in Florida this week as a month\u2019s worth of rain could fall in just a few days from storms fueled by tropical moisture streaming in from the Caribbean. The rain is coming from a broad and disorganized area of storms stuck over the state. By late week, the National Hurricane Center gives the storms a low chance of organizing into the first tropical depression of hurricane season as it moves off the Southeast coast. But storms will drench Florida with tropical downpours, tropical depression or not. Flood watches are in effect for more than 6 million people in southern Florida Tuesday. The watches are set to expire Wednesday night but may be extended as heavy rain persists through Friday. Double-digit rainfall totals are likely in parts of the state by Friday, but a few areas in southwest Florida could approach 20 inches of rain. While the state is no stranger to drenching rain, heavy rain events are getting even heavier as the world warms\u00a0due to fossil fuel pollution. The daily downpours are also being fueled by a firehose of tropical moisture from parts of the Caribbean funneling straight into South Florida along a front draped over the state. This nearly stationary front is where storms began unloading heavy rain Tuesday morning. Rain will be beneficial at first, as half of Florida is experiencing abnormal dryness or drought conditions, with the worst drought centered in the bull\u2019s-eye for the heaviest rain, according to the US Drought Monitor. The flood risk will increase as storms unload drenching rain over the same area day after day, causing rainfall totals to climb, soils to saturate and area waterways to swell. The bulk of the heaviest rain will fall from Tuesday through Thursday night. The southwestern Gulf Coast of the state, from Sarasota to Everglades National Park, is at the greatest risk for rainfall totalling 10 inches or more. But bursts of intense rain outside of the highest risk areas could cause flash flooding, especially in urban or poor-drainage areas. How a giant gyre of moisture leads to tropical trouble The robust moisture fueling this week\u2019s storms typically pools over parts of the Caribbean Sea and the southern Gulf of Mexico at this point in the season into the Central American gyre: A large, disorganized area of showers and thunderstorms that rotates over Central America and its surrounding waters. The gyre\u2019s broad spin and deep moisture can help tropical systems form in parts of the Caribbean, the Gulf of Mexico and even the extreme eastern Pacific when other necessary factors \u2013 including favorable upper-level winds and warm ocean water\u00a0\u2013 align. The gyre typically first develops around the late spring and early summer, which is one reason most June tropical systems form in the Gulf of Mexico or off the East Coast of the US. Despite plenty of bathtub warm water in the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico, upper-level winds, known as wind shear, are much too disruptive right now for any tropical systems to form in these areas, according to Jon Rizzo, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Key West, Florida. What the gyre is doing, is juicing up the wet weather across the Gulf Coast, like what Florida will endure this week. \u201cJust the mere presence of the Central American gyre forming tells us that summer is here and the rainy season is about to begin,\u201d Jon Rizzo, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Key West, Florida, told CNN.

{"id": "2024_05_02_style_aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl", "text": "Miami has a new addition to its skyline \u2013 a 66-story residential tower built by Aston Martin, marking the British luxury sports carmaker\u2019s first foray into the residential real estate market. Comprising of 391 units, Aston Martin Residences Miami sits at the mouth of the Miami River on Biscayne Bay, the firm said in a statement Tuesday. Designed in partnership with architect Rodolfo Miani of Bodas Mian Anger and built by G&G Business Developments, the 249-meter- (818-foot-) tall building houses seven penthouses, each with private pools and terraces, as well as apartments ranging in size from one to five bedrooms. The largest unit is the \u201cUnique Triplex Penthouse,\u201d arranged over three floors at the top of the building, which remains on the market for $59 million. The property was officially opened on Tuesday. Timed to coincide with the Formula One Miami Grand Prix, the company said in a statement that it marks \u201cthe latest distinct expression of Aston Martin\u2019s ultra-luxury high performance brand.\u201d Featuring an infinity pool with a pool deck, jacuzzis and cabanas on the 55th floor, the sail-shaped complex has a two-floor fitness center, two movie theaters and a virtual golf simulator. The building has a sky bar and lounge, chef\u2019s kitchen, ballroom and private dining areas, as well as a spa, beauty salon and barber shop. Direct access to the sea via a superyacht marina is also available, plus a private butler service. Germ\u00e1n Coto, chief executive officer of G&G Business Developments, told CNN Tuesday that the firm wanted to work on a project in the \u201ccosmopolitan city\u201d of Miami, and that this piece of land was the perfect choice. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing plot with an excellent view of the river,\u201d said Coto. The structure\u2019s aerodynamic shape helps the building deal with the technical challenges presented by high winds in the area, as well as evoking the sleek shape of an Aston Martin, according to Marek Reichman, executive vice president and chief creative officer of Aston Martin. It also becomes wider from the base to the mid-section before tightening once more towards the top, making it appear to bow out over people on street level, Reichman told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the drama,\u201d he added. Challenges However, the process wasn\u2019t all plain sailing. \u201cIt was difficult to achieve what we wanted because the space and the plot is kind of small,\u201d said Coto, with the building fitting into a 1.25-acre plot of land. Meanwhile, local building regulations imposed strict standards, explained Reichman, taking into account the low-lying land and propensity for flooding. \u201cThey were some of the most amazing challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to withstand the flooding with the windows that are on street level.\u201d There were further obstacles due to the curved shape of the building, which means that units on the east side have an individual architectural structural component. Aston Martin touches Homeowners are able to customize their interior space with the help of the Aston Martin design team, with three style packages \u2013 Timeless, Covert and Indulgent \u2013 drawing on the company\u2019s British heritage, as well as the building\u2019s context. \u201cIt needs to have part of the DNA of an Aston Martin,\u201d Reichman said. \u201cBut we are in Miami, you don\u2019t have a cold November evening where you need to put the log fire on, so you\u2019ve got to be considerate of the environment that you\u2019re in.\u201d Design elements running through the building include doors with bespoke Aston Martin handles, number plinths and kestrel tan leather door tabs. Aston Martin said that 99% of the properties sold before the building was completed. Residences were sold for $1.5 million to $8.5 million, while penthouses ranged from $16 million to $59 million. The Unique Triplex Penthouse, on the market for $59 million, comes with the last remaining Aston Martin Vulcan, an 820 brake horsepower all-carbon fiber supercar, of which only 24 exist, a spokesman for the company said. Meanwhile, buyers of the 47 Signature and Penthouse units were also able to choose between an Aston Martin DBX sports SUV or the company\u2019s DB11 sportscar. Aston Martin isn\u2019t the first luxury carmaker to enter the residential property market. A 63-story building from Bentley will open in 2026 along the coastline of Sunny Isles Beach, Florida. Featuring 216 units, the property will have an elevator designed to take residents up to their doorstep while seated inside their cars.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/02/style/aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_06_europe_european-parliament-elections-2024-explained-intl", "text": "One of the world\u2019s largest democratic exercises is underway, with some 373 million people across the European Union eligible to vote in elections for the next European Parliament. Voters in the 27 nations of the EU head to the polls from Thursday to Sunday to elect 720 members of the parliament, which will play a crucial role in shaping the priorities and political direction of the bloc for the next five years. The vote comes at a pivotal moment for the EU, which is grappling with issues ranging from the wars in Ukraine and Gaza to immigration and climate change. Polls have predicted big gains for hard-right parties in a number of countries, which could have long-term implications for the continent. Here\u2019s what you need to know about the world\u2019s biggest multi-country election. How do the elections work? The elections are held over four days every five years in June. This year, they are taking place between\u00a0June\u00a06\u00a0and\u00a09. They are held over multiple days because, despite being elections to an EU institution, they are still arranged and managed as national\u00a0ballots\u00a0by each of the EU\u2019s 27 member states.  In some countries, they may all be\u00a0held\u00a0on a single day, whereas others take place over several days. Because the elections are managed at a national level, they are not all carried out in the same exact way. However, they must all employ a proportional representation system\u00a0\u2013where the number of lawmakers\u00a0elected\u00a0to the parliament directly correlates to the percentage of people who voted for them. Once all the votes have been counted, each national political party will be assigned a number of\u00a0members of European Parliament (MEPs)\u00a0relative to their vote share. It is up to the member states to determine how this is assigned. Once they have been appointed to the parliament, MEPs can then join a European political party, which allows them to sit in a group in the parliament. These parties and groupings are multinational and based on a loose set of shared beliefs.\u00a0The bigger the grouping, the more influence it has in parliament. Results will start to come in late on Sunday, but full results will not be known until at least Monday. What\u2019s the point of the European Parliament and what do MEPs do? The European Parliament sits primarily in Brussels, Belgium, but moves roughly once a month to Strasbourg, France. It is the legislative branch of the EU and one of the bloc\u2019s three main institutions \u2013 along with the European Commission, which is the executive branch, and the European Council, which is made up of ministers from the governments of the 27 member states. It is the only EU institution where\u00a0representatives\u00a0are directly elected,\u00a0and MEPs pass laws which are applied all over the bloc. In order for any legislation to be implemented, both the council and parliament have to agree. One of the parliament\u2019s most crucial roles is approving the makeup of the commission, which is ultimately responsible for the political direction of the world\u2019s largest trading bloc, and it has the final say on who is appointed as president of the commission. Currently the top job is filled by Germany\u2019s Ursula von der Leyen, who is seeking a second term at the helm. The parliament also has\u00a0ultimate approval\u00a0over\u00a0the billions of euros allocated in the EU budget. It often has the final\u00a0word\u00a0on major policy issues\u00a0such as\u00a0the budget, trade\u00a0and\u00a0sanctions on foreign nationals. The parliament can also put major international objectives in the deep freeze. For example, A comprehensive mutual investment agreement between the EU and China is effectively on hold while some MEPs are under sanctions from China. The parliament as a whole has refused to advance the agreement until the sanctions are lifted. What are the biggest issues in this vote? Since this week\u2019s election is in effect 27 individual national elections, some\u00a0issues are in play in some countries but not in others. Broadly speaking, immigration, climate change, security and support for Ukraine are issues that matter across the bloc. While\u00a0irregular\u00a0migration figures are lower than they were\u00a0during\u00a0the 2015-2016\u00a0refugee\u00a0crisis, it is still a sensitive issue across the EU, as some countries\u00a0bear a disproportionate share of\u00a0the burden\u00a0while\u00a0others are loathe to\u00a0do their part. Slowing the effects of climate change and making Europe greener has been a priority for a long time. However, some countries now balk at the cost of\u00a0cutting fossil fuel emissions. The EU is largely united on its support for Ukraine, but that too could be affected if populists like\u00a0France\u2019s Marine\u00a0Le Pen are elected\u00a0to lead national governments. What are the political groupings? If the\u00a0720 MEPs representing 27 countries and hundreds of different domestic political parties\u00a0were all left to their own devices, things would\u00a0get very complicated. To simplify the work of the parliament, leaders of national governments form alliances with each other based on their shared political beliefs \u2013 the European political parties. If\u00a0a politician is\u00a0a member of, for example, French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s Renaissance party in France,\u00a0he or she\u00a0will stand for that party as an MEP at a national level. If\u00a0they\u00a0are then elected to the European Parliament,\u00a0they\u00a0will join the centrist, liberal European party, Renew Europe \u2013\u00a0which currently has members from 24 of the 27 EU members. Once\u00a0seated\u00a0in parliament,\u00a0they\u00a0will sit alongside the other MEPs from Renew parties in other countries as a political grouping. There are seven main groupings, ranging from the extremes of the far right to the far left. The two dominant groupings are the center-right conservative European People\u2019s Party (EPP) and the center-left\u00a0Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D). Due to proportional representation, no single group has anything resembling a majority and therefore\u00a0they\u00a0must form broad coalitions\u00a0to get anything done in parliament. The EPP and S&D (or their previous incarnations) have dominated this coalition\u00a0for decades. While these two parties are still expected to be the largest after the elections, all eyes are on the other main right-wing groups,\u00a0the\u00a0European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) and the hard-right, populist Identity and Democracy (ID). What\u2019s likely to happen in the election? It is expected that the EPP and S&D centrist coalition will largely hold. However, it is also expected that ECR and ID will make significant gains that result\u00a0in more power in the next parliament. The two hard-right parties have not said they will work together and the leaderships of the two groups are known to dislike each other. Giorgia Meloni, the Italian prime minister and president of the ECR\u00a0bloc, has an eye on working with the mainstream right at an EU level, for instance. During\u00a0the\u00a02022 Italian\u00a0general\u00a0election, much was made of Meloni\u2019s right-wing rhetoric. She was a hardliner on immigration,\u00a0and\u00a0had\u00a0questioned LGBTQ+ rights, among other things. However, since winning she has been pragmatic in working with\u00a0those in power\u00a0at a European level \u2013 most notably\u00a0von der Leyen, the commission\u2019s president, who is herself a member of the more mainstream EPP. Von der Leyen even went so far as\u00a0to visit\u00a0the Italian island of Lampedusa, which has\u00a0been\u00a0an arrival point for\u00a0large numbers of irregular\u00a0migrants, to set out a\u00a010-point EU plan\u00a0to support Italy with the influx. Critics say that\u00a0Meloni\u00a0has sold out; supporters say that she has played her cards perfectly and managed to pull the EU\u2019s center in her direction.\u00a0Evidence of this might be the EU\u00a0having\u00a0finally\u00a0agreed a deal\u00a0earlier\u00a0this year\u00a0on how it would share the\u00a0weight\u00a0of irregular migration, after years of deadlock and negotiation. How could the election affect European politics? The\u00a0possibility\u00a0that the EU\u2019s political center might be up for grabs\u00a0is the most important context of these elections. The opaque and fluid nature of politics at a European level means that a lot can change over the course of a five-year period. Between the EPP and S&D, there might be a centrist coalition on day one of this\u00a0new\u00a0parliament. But these are not formal coalitions, rather loose alliances that vote together, issue by issue. This is where the idea of a\u00a0right-wing\u00a0ECR and ID axis becomes significant. The rise of the far-right\u2019s influence in European Parliament follows a similar trend at the national level in a number of major EU member states. National\u00a0elections\u00a0are\u00a0set to take place in France in 2027,\u00a0in which\u00a0right-wing populist\u00a0Le Pen could emerge victorious. She is the chair of ID and has recently made obvious efforts to detoxify the\u00a0bloc\u00a0by expelling\u00a0lawmakers from\u00a0the far-right Alternative for Germany\u00a0(AfD)\u00a0from\u00a0its ranks\u00a0following accusations of antisemitism.\u00a0 A\u00a0victory in the French presidential election would\u00a0of course\u00a0make Le Pen a much bigger major player in European politics. That might not mean any formal coalition between the center-right EPP and ID, but the politics of the European Parliament is a sliding scale of sorts and, if France shifts right, it\u2019s fair to say the center-right will take note. There are EPP members (and certainly ECR members) who will agree with ID members on\u00a0matters\u00a0such as\u00a0immigration and climate change. When those issues come up and the parliament has a role to play, it\u2019s not implausible that\u00a0the\u00a0ECR and ID could\u00a0then put\u00a0huge pressure on EPP lawmakers to vote the same way. It is, after all, always worth remembering that these people must still answer to their domestic voters, who can sack them at the next election.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/europe/european-parliament-elections-2024-explained-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_10_weather_summer-forecast-disasters-fema-climate", "text": "The United States has been rocked by an extraordinary number of tornadoes and devastating storms this year that have already left a staggering price tag. Now heading into what forecasters say will be an extreme summer \u2013 from punishing heat waves to severe weather and hurricanes \u2013 the nation\u2019s disaster relief agency is expected to run out of money before it\u2019s even over. The US has been thrashed with 11 extreme weather disasters with costs exceeding $1 billion so far this year, with a total price tag of $25.1 billion, according to an updated tally from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. It\u2019s tied for the second-most such disasters on record and doesn\u2019t even include the extreme weather in the second half of May, said\u00a0Adam Smith, an applied climatologist with NOAA. That is worrying news for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, whose major disaster relief fund could slip into the red by the end of summer \u2013 a more than $1.3 billion shortfall in August, according to a May report. Florida\u2019s two Republican senators recently wrote a letter to FEMA asking the agency how much more money it would need to respond to hurricane season. In a statement to CNN, a FEMA spokesperson didn\u2019t address exactly how much funding it would need to get through hurricane season, but said the agency is continuing to work with Congress \u201cto ensure sufficient funding is available\ufeff.\u201d \u201cWithout additional funding, FEMA will take steps prior to funding exhaustion to ensure resources are available to support ongoing lifesaving and life sustaining activities,\u201d the spokesperson said. In the event of a major catastrophe like a hurricane, the agency would have a funding reserve set aside for initial response and recovery operations. FEMA\u2019s tenuous balance sheet reflects how many destructive storms have already lashed the US. This spring produced the second-most tornadoes to-date since records began in 1950, according to the Storm Prediction Center. Tornado activity skyrocketed from late April through May, with more than 780 confirmed tornadoes cutting across the central and eastern US during April and May, the SPC said. Some storms have been deadly. An EF4 that ripped through Greenfield, Iowa, killed five. Another tornado in Cooke County, Texas, later in the month killed seven people. Severe thunderstorms have been extremely destructive, with hail wreaking havoc across the central US.\u00a0Severe thunderstorms blasted multiple cities with hurricane-force wind gusts in May. A derecho with 100 mph wind turned debris into projectiles and shattered glass windows in downtown Houston skyscrapers. Nearly a million homes and businesses were left without power, many for days, after violent winds mangled massive electrical transmission towers. And scientists are warning this summer could continue the destruction as the dramatic warming of the planet and oceans from burning fossil fuels set the stage for a supercharged hurricane season and dangerous heat. The climate crisis\u2019 favorite season Summer historically is the season with the most billion-dollar disasters because it is \u201ca transition period of many extremes historically, as the severe storm season continues while the prospect of hurricane season approaches,\u201d Smith said. A chorus of expert voices are calling for an above-average Atlantic hurricane season as anxiety-inducing conditions in the atmosphere and oceans align. Record-breaking ocean heat is expected to\u00a0feed hurricanes, helping them form, strengthen and survive. El Ni\u00f1o is predicted to give way to La Ni\u00f1a and create more favorable atmospheric conditions for storms to thrive. Just about every kind of extreme weather is possible during summer, including more severe thunderstorms. June is the third-most active month for tornadoes in the US, according to the SPC. It\u2019s also the most-active month for destructive and costly severe hail, a 2012 study found. While the connection between hurricanes and climate change is strong, scientists are less sure whether there\u2019s a link to stronger or more frequent tornadoes but are sure it is making heat waves more intense and frequent. Above-average temperatures are expected over nearly every square mile of the Lower 48 this summer, and it began early: It\u2019s already been the hottest start to June on record in Las Vegas, as the West gets hit with a series of early-season heat waves. Prolonged, intense heat dries out soil and can lead to\u00a0drought and billions of dollars in costs due to crop losses. Last year, a series of heat domes seared the South and produced the worst drought on record for Louisiana and one of the state\u2019s worst fire seasons on record. Heat can dry out grass and create a tinderbox for fast-moving wildfires, particularly in the central and western US. California\u2019s fire season could get a late start because of another exceptional wet season, according to Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles. But as heat takes its toll, wildfire activity could \u201creally amp up\u201d in California in late summer as the bounty of grass and brush from the wet season dries out, Swain said. He also highlighted the Great Basin in Nevada and Utah as a spot that normally doesn\u2019t see wildfire but could, due to a \u201chuge proliferation of grass.\u201d According to Swain, wildfire activity could really kick off in late summer, and if that holds up, emergency response could stretch well into the fall. It\u2019s shaping up to be another year of year-round extreme weather.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/weather/summer-forecast-disasters-fema-climate/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_21_sport_individual-neutral-athlete-olympics-explainer-spt-intl", "text": "Russian athletes have competed under several different guises throughout the 128-year history of the Olympics, and they will be known by another new name at Paris 2024. Following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine \u2013 supported by Belarus \u2013 in February 2022, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) recommended that Russian and Belarusian athletes should be prohibited from competing in international sporting events. In January 2023, the IOC announced its intention to allow these athletes to compete as neutrals, in a similar way to how Russian and Belarusian tennis players are presented at ATP, WTA and Grand Slam events without any reference to their nationality. The Russian Olympic Committee was then suspended entirely by the IOC in October 2023 when it absorbed Ukrainian regional sports organizations in Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia. There has been much debate around whether Russian and Belarusian athletes should be permitted to take part in the Olympics, with Ukrainian athletes in particular voicing their concerns. However, the IOC Executive Board ruled that it would be unfair to punish athletes based on their passports alone, thereby allowing some to compete in Paris, albeit under very strict conditions. Here\u2019s everything you need to know about the participation of Russian and Belarusian athletes at the 2024 Olympics. \u2018No flag, anthem, colors\u2019 An Individual Neutral Athlete is the name used to refer to athletes with either a Russian or Belarusian passport who will be competing at this year\u2019s Games in July and August. These athletes are referred to by the abbreviation AIN, which comes from the French translation Athl\u00e8tes Individuels Neutres. These athletes will be permitted to compete if they meet eligibility requirements. No reference to either country will be made at the Games through the athletes\u2019 participation. \u201cThe sanctions against those responsible for the war, the Russian and Belarusian states and governments, remain in place for the Olympic Games Paris 2024,\u201d the IOC said in a statement. \u201cNo flag, anthem, colors or any other identifications whatsoever of Russia or Belarus will be displayed at the Olympic Games Paris 2024 in any official venue or any official function,\u201d the statement continues. Competition gear for the AINs has not yet been revealed, so it is unclear whether it will bear the turquoise colors of the brand-new flag of the AINs, or that they will don basic sportswear. An anthem \u2013 without lyrics \u2013 has also been commissioned for use in medal ceremonies. Though AINs are eligible to compete and win Olympic medals, they will not be displayed in the medal table of nations. AINs will also be excluded from the parade of delegations at the Opening Ceremony on the basis that they are individual athletes rather than a team, though the IOC has said \u201can opportunity will be provided for them to experience the event.\u201d Individual Neutral Athlete Eligibility Review Panel In December 2023, the Executive Board of the IOC decided that Russian and Belarusian athletes who qualified through the existing qualification systems of international federations would have to meet strict requirements if they are to be selected as an AIN. There will be no Russian or Belarusian representation in team events, with participation limited to individual competition. Per the IOC, athletes who actively support the war or who are contracted to the Russian or Belarusian military or national security agencies will not be eligible to be entered or to compete. The same stipulation applies to support personnel. Like all other athletes, AINs will need to meet anti-doping requirements to be considered for selection. The eligibility of these athletes will be determined by the newly established Individual Neutral Athlete Eligibility Review Panel. Two-time NBA champion and six-time All-Star Pau Gasol is part of the panel, representing the IOC Ethics Commission. The Spaniard will sit alongside IOC Vice-President and former artistic swimmer Nicole Hoevertsz, and former Olympic table tennis gold medalist Ryu Seung-min, who will be representing the Athletes\u2019 Commission. International sporting federations will need to submit their lists of qualified athletes to panel for review. At the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo (postponed to 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic) and the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, Russian athletes competed under the name of the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) \u00a0as a result of the country\u2019s state-sponsored doping program. Athletes could compete under the ROC banner if they could prove that they were not connected to the scandal. However, with the ROC bearing both the name and colors of Russia \u2013 as well as the subsequent suspension of the ROC in October \u2013 it was no longer a viable option for Russian athletes to compete under this name in Paris. It is also important to note that the ROC was not a neutral body, rather a delegation of Russian athletes which technically didn\u2019t compete on the behalf of Russia, but retained a right to represent the country in all but an official capacity. Numbers of AINs at the Paris Olympics The IOC stated that, as of March 28, 12 AINs with a Russian passport and seven AINs with a Belarusian passport have qualified for Paris 2024 but said that the final number of athletes who will actually compete at the Games would not be communicated until the selection process has been finalized. \u201cThe maximum number, which is unlikely to be reached, would be 55 and 28 respectively,\u201d the IOC told CNN. In comparison, Russia sent 330 athletes to Tokyo in 2021 while Belarus sent 104. There is also the matter of whether Moscow will actually accept the conditions laid out by the IOC. Russia is planning to host its own \u201cFriendship Games\u201d later in the year, an event which has been condemned by the IOC. The identity of the athletes is also yet to be revealed, but it is possible that Russian former world No. 1 tennis player Daniil Medvedev will be part of the field. The former US Open champion said that he would be happy to participate as a neutral. \u201cI decided for myself that whenever I can play the Olympics, I want to be there I want to represent what I can represent,\u201d he told reporters last month. \u201cIf it\u2019s not under the flag, I know who I am, I know why I play tennis and I played like this all my life. Russia has competed under a neutral banner on two previous occasions. The ROC was suspended in 2017 as a result of the doping scandal ahead of the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea the following year, but selected Russian athletes who met pre-competition conditions were still given the opportunity to compete as \u201cOlympic Athletes from Russia\u201d and were represented by the Olympic flag. Russia and Belarus were also part of the \u201cUnified Team\u201d at the 1992 Summer Games in Barcelona after the dissolution of the Soviet Union the previous year. The delegation was made up of former Soviet republics \u2013 aside from the Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia \u2013 which had elected to compete as one unit.

Kim\u2019s sister and government spokeswoman Kim Yo Jong warned the resumption of loudspeaker broadcasts was \u201ca prelude to a very dangerous situation.\u201d In a statement carried by North Korean state media, Kim said South Korea would be subject to an unspecified \u201cnew counteraction\u201d\u00a0from the North if it continued with the loudspeaker broadcasts and failed to prevent activists from\u00a0sending anti-North Korean propaganda leaflets over the border. \u201cI sternly warn Seoul to stop at once this dangerous act,\u201d Kim said, adding that Seoul is creating a \u201cnew environment of crisis.\u201d South\u00a0Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS)\u00a0has maintained North\u00a0Korea\u00a0is \u201cfully responsible\u201d for the current situation and urged the North to \u201cimmediately stop such mean acts like sending waste balloons.\u201d In a statement Monday, a JCS spokesman would not say whether the South would continue to broadcast over the loudspeakers, noting only that\u00a0the military would conduct missions \u201cwith flexibility according to the strategic and operational situation.\u201d The escalating tit-for-tat has sparked concerns of potential retaliatory military action. Last week, the South Korean government suspended a 2018 deal\u00a0to reduce military tensions with the North, allowing it to resume propaganda broadcasts and potentially restart military exercises along the border. South Korea\u2019s military once routinely deployed propaganda broadcasts as a means of psychological warfare against the North, until it withdrew the equipment following the 2018 deal. The broadcasts inform North\u00a0Korean soldiers and residents of the \u201creality of North\u00a0Korea,\u201d and the development of\u00a0South\u00a0Korea, and modern Korean culture, according to the JCS. Tit-for-tat balloons In recent weeks, the North has floated more than a thousand trash-filled balloons across the heavily fortified border, in what it claims is a response to the years-long practice among South Korean activist groups of sending\u00a0balloons with anti-North Korea leaflets in the other direction. As of Monday morning, the South Korean military had found \u201caround 50 balloons\u201d that fell into its territory overnight Sunday. Many other balloons are believed to have flown back into\u00a0North\u00a0Korea due to the wind, according to the JCS spokesman. On Thursday, South Korean activists sent balloons across the border toward the North, carrying hundreds of thousands of leaflets condemning leader Kim Jong Un and 5,000 USB sticks containing K-pop and K-dramas. For decades, North Korea has been almost completely closed off from the rest of the world, with tight control over what information gets in or out. Foreign materials including movies and books are banned, with only a few state-sanctioned exceptions; those caught with foreign contraband often face severe punishment, defectors say. Earlier this year a South Korean research group released rare footage that it claimed showed North Korean teenagers\u00a0sentenced to hard labor\u00a0for watching and distributing K-dramas. Restrictions softened somewhat in recent decades as North Korea\u2019s relationship with China expanded. Tentative steps to open up allowed some South Korean elements, including\u00a0parts of its pop culture,\u00a0to seep into the hermit nation \u2013 especially in 2017 and 2018, when relations thawed between the two countries. But the situation in North Korea deteriorated in the following years and diplomatic talks fell apart \u2013 prompting\u00a0strict rules to snap back\u00a0into place in the North.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/asia/north-korea-trash-balloons-south-korea-loudspeakers-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_09_middleeast_israel-hostage-rescue-gaza-intl-hnk", "text": "Four hostages have been rescued in an Israeli operation that took weeks of planning \u2013 but killed scores of Palestinians in Gaza and left behind a trail of devastation. At least 274 Palestinians were killed in the operation and hundreds injured, Gazan authorities said, who do not distinguish between civilian and military casualties. While there has been euphoria for the families of the four rescued \u2013 Noa Argamani, Almog Meir Jan, Andrey Kozlov, and Shlomi Ziv, eight months after they were kidnapped from the Nova music festival on October 7 - celebrations could be brief. Israel\u2019s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu remains under intense pressure, with his goal of destroying Hamas and rescuing the remaining hostages still distant. He has refused to sign up to the latest peace plan, presented by US President Joe Biden last week, and the toll among Palestinians continues to rise. Here\u2019s what we know about Saturday\u2019s operation. What happened in the raid? Unusually, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) opted for a daytime raid on the Nuseirat camp in central Gaza on Saturday - saying that it allowed them a greater element of surprise. As part of their preparations, the military built models of the apartments the hostages were held in after receiving intelligence regarding their location. \u201cIsraeli forces have been preparing for this rescue mission for weeks. They underwent intensive training,\u201d Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari told a press briefing. Hagari said Israeli forces had to enter civilian areas to reach hostages as this was where Hamas had embedded itself. Some of the special forces were disguised as displaced Palestinians and as members of Hamas\u2019s military wing, according a witness as well as reporting from CNN analyst Barak Ravid, citing eyewitnesses in the refugee camp. CNN has\u00a0reached out to the IDF for comment. Without the cover of darkness, the IDF ran a greater risk of failing to get in and out of Gaza safely. One officer was shot and killed during the operation, according to Israeli police. Hagari said the IDF had received intelligence on the location of the hostages beforehand, noting that hostages in Gaza were frequently moved around and Argamani had previously been held elsewhere. Similar raids had been called off at the last minute \u201cmore than three or four times\u201d due to unfavorable conditions, he added. The first phase of Saturday\u2019s operation saw the IDF target militant infrastructure with pre-planned strikes, Hagari said. Hagari said that the IDF had come under intense fire, especially after withdrawing from the apartments, but did not provide evidence for his claims. \u201cWhile under fire, under fire inside the buildings, under fire on the way out from Gaza, our forces rescued our hostages,\u201d he said. Ravid, the CNN analyst, also reported there was a \u201crobust firefight\u201d after the hostages were rescued. Why was the Palestinian toll so high? The raid took place mid-morning, meaning the streets were teeming with people shopping at a nearby market. The hostages were held in civilian buildings, according to the IDF, in the midst of the densely populated camp. Hagari said the hostages had been locked in two separate apartments in multi-story buildings about 200 meters (650 feet) apart, with Argamani held in a different building to the three men. There were early indications of an ongoing mission when Israel announced ahead of the news on Saturday morning it was operating in Nuseirat, but it had launched a new offensive in the area midweek. Heavy bombardment was reported during the Israeli rescue mission. There are varying reports on the number of Palestinians killed. The latest figures from Gazan authorities say 274 Palestinians were killed and 698 injured \u2013 which would mark one of the deadliest days in months for people living in Gaza. The IDF has disputed those numbers, saying it estimated the number of casualties from the operation was \u201cunder 100.\u201d CNN cannot independently verify either side\u2019s figures. But local residents described the attack as a \u201chell on earth,\u201d with scenes of carnage following the strikes that led up to the rescue. Eyewitnesses have described civilians being struck down by airstrikes and shrapnel. One local Palestinian\u00a0man named Abu Abdallah told a CNN stringer on the ground that people were struck in their homes at around 5am local time. \u201cWe tried to get ambulances, but no\u00a0one could enter as it was already a military zone,\u201d he said. \u201cDogs were eating people\u2019s remains, we pulled out six martyrs, all torn up children and women, we risked our lives to get them to the hospital. The soldiers told us to go back but we had to continue,\u201d he added. Another local resident, Nidal Abdo, said he was shopping at\u00a0Nuseirat\u00a0market before \u201ca crazy bombardment started hitting everywhere.\u201d \u201c[It was] something we never witnessed before, maybe 150 rockets fell in less than 10 minutes, while we were running away more fell\u00a0on\u00a0the market,\u201d he said. Footage from\u00a0Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, in nearby Deir al-Balah, shows trucks and ambulances transferring injured people and bodies to the hospital. The hospital\u2019s emergency room is overwhelmed. People can be seen in the footage waiting\u00a0on\u00a0the hospital floor. Graphic video shows many Palestinians, including children, injured with blood on their faces and clothes. Footage from the hospital\u00a0also shows people screaming and crying, huddled over bodies covered in blankets. What\u2019s the reaction been? Families of the hostages expressed their overwhelming joy at having their loved ones returned safely. Orit Meir, mother\u00a0of\u00a0Almog Meir Jan, said at a news conference Saturday that she was excited to hug her son again. \u201cI couldn\u2019t stop hugging him,\u201d she said. \u201cTomorrow is my birthday so I got my present.\u201d Argamani was reunited with her terminally ill mother, who suffers from Stage 4 cancer. Netanyahu - who met with the rescued hostages and their families at Sheba Hospital on Saturday - called the operation \u201cheroic,\u201d adding that the government would continue \u201cto do everything we can\u201d to recover all those being held in the enclave. The operation was \u201ca great light in the terrible\u00a0darkness,\u201d Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid said Saturday. Avi Marciano, father of Corporal Noa Marciano, a 19-year-old hostage who died in captivity, said Netanyahu\u2019s public celebrations over the hostage releases contrasted with how he reacted when the outcome was not as positive. \u201cI am truly happy from the bottom of my heart for the families that were fortunate and able to hug their loved ones. I\u2019m also envious,\u201d Haaretz quoted him as saying. \u201cThis emphasizes how bad our ending was. When the ending is bad, the prime minister doesn\u2019t show up. He doesn\u2019t call, either.\u201d Hamas meanwhile accused\u00a0Israel\u00a0of committing \u201ca horrific massacre\u201d on civilians in Nuseirat. The militant group said\u00a0Israel\u2019s killing of scores of people as it mounted a hostage rescue operation was a \u201cbrutal crime, devoid of the values of civilization and humanity.\u201d   Palestinian\u00a0leader\u00a0Mahmoud Abbas has called for an emergency session of the\u00a0UN\u00a0Security Council while several MIddle Eastern countries condemned the operation. After the rescue mission, US national\u00a0security adviser\u00a0Jake Sullivan said an \u201cenduring ceasefire\u201d deal\u00a0between Israel and Hamas is \u201cthe only credible path forward.\u201d Sullivan acknowledged the civilian toll of Israel\u2019s military operation Saturday while saying Hamas, which took the hostages during its deadly October 7 attacks on Israel, was putting Palestinians in harm\u2019s way. What does it mean for the war? Hostage rescues are rare. This is only the third such successful operation of the conflict. Saturday\u2019s operation shows they are still possible and may encourage further efforts from the Israeli military, given a major goal of Israel\u2019s Gaza offensive is to rescue the remaining hostages. However some have pointed to a ceasefire deal as a much more effective way of freeing the hostages. More than 100 hostages were freed under a temporary truce last year, while Israel has rescued seven hostages by military means. Hagai Levine, of the health team at the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, said operations such as the one seen on Saturday were \u201cnot a way we can bring 120 hostages back home. \u201cWe must, all of us together, the world, follow President Biden speech and go with the deal that will enable all of them, dead or alive, come back home with a ceasefire.\u201d Instead, Levine called for a ceasefire deal that would \u201cenable all of [the hostages], dead or alive\u201d to be brought back home. There are warnings that the IDF\u2019s deadly operation on Saturday may have further set back a potential ceasefire agreement. An Egyptian official told CNN that Israel\u2019s operation will have a \u201cnegative effect\u201d on negotiations to end the war in Gaza. \u201c[It] won\u2019t be easy,\u201d the Egyptian official, who is familiar with the talks, told CNN. Egypt, along with Qatar, has been helping to coordinate negotiations between Israel and Hamas. On Sunday, the US called for a vote on its UN Security Council resolution backing the proposal for a permanent ceasefire and release of the hostages in\u00a0Gaza. \u201cIsrael has accepted this proposal and the Security Council has an opportunity to speak with one voice and call on Hamas to do the same,\u201d Nate Evans, the spokesperson for the US Mission to the UN, said in a statement Sunday. \u201cDoing so would help save lives and the suffering of civilians in\u00a0Gaza\u00a0as well as the hostages and their families,\u201d he said. Since November, intensive negotiations over a ceasefire and a deal to swap hostages for Palestinian prisoners have landed in a stalemate. Israel last month pressed ahead with its ground operation in central Rafah despite\u00a0international condemnation\u00a0for its escalation in the southern Gaza city where some\u00a01.3 million Palestinians\u00a0were taking shelter before Israel began its operation there.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/09/middleeast/israel-hostage-rescue-gaza-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "travel_goat-caddies-silvies-ranch-resort-spt-spc", "text": "To most, goat is simply the name for a horned ruminant mammal. For those in sporting circles, it\u2019s a four-letter acronym bestowed upon the greatest of all time. Venture through the myriad pine forests and winding creeks into the Blue Mountains of Eastern Oregon though, and both apply simultaneously. Silvies Valley Ranch offers a slice of Wild West luxury to travelers and \u2013 for the golfers among them \u2013 the opportunity to be caddied for by a rigorously trained team of goats. A world first when launched in 2018, the current team is the best to ever do it, as far as Silvies owner Dr. Scott Campbell is concerned \u2013 and they have even convinced some initial skeptics. \u201cA lot of people said it was a stupid idea,\u201d Campbell told CNN. \u201cThey thought it would make people call us a goat track. Nothing could be further from the truth. Everybody has a good time \u2026 People come from all over the world.\u201d New career path The radical setup was born from a practical problem. McVeigh\u2019s Gauntlet \u2013 Silvies\u2019 seven-hole challenge course \u2013 was far too steep for golf carts to safely traverse. With players only requiring a few clubs to play the course, carrying such a load was well within the capabilities of the ranch\u2019s 3,000 grazers, whose ancestors were transporting cargo long before golfers were planting tees. \u201cThe goats were asking for different career opportunities, and as an equal opportunity employer, we developed a new career path for them,\u201d Campbell joked. A three-month evaluation process sees potential caddies as young as six months old scouted on their friendliness and physical aptitude. Those that progress to the next stage are fitted with a custom-made golf bag \u2013 tailored by Oregon-based company Seamus Golf \u2013 to see if they\u2019re comfortable carrying it. The bag is near-empty for training, but for full-time caddies contains six clubs, extra balls and tees, six drink cans and their daily wage: a few dozen peanuts. Chosen candidates are taught the course and put on a carefully monitored physical and nutrition regime before starting their new role from two years old, working six-hour shifts three to four days a week. An on-site vet visits the caddy shack \u2013 situated next to the club house and open to visitors throughout the day \u2013 on a weekly basis. Eight goats make up today\u2019s caddie team \u2013 Chunky, Mulligan, Harry, Bogey, Birdie, Charlie, Carrot and Jack \u2013 with nine yearlings in training and 10 three-month-old prospects waiting in the wings. None of them were among the founding four bagholders, formerly led by pioneering Caddy Master Bruce LeGoat. Roundabout LaDoe and Peanut LeGoat are on maternity leave, with the former giving birth to triplets last month, while Bruce and second-in-command Mike LeChevon have since retired at eight years old. Fear not, \u201cretired\u201d is not a euphemism for a permanent transfer to the ranch\u2019s gourmet kitchen. Instead, they see out their twilight years as pets to golfers, with Silvies taking online applications to join the adoption waiting list. It\u2019s a testament to the popularity of the caddies, who can also now be hired for the ranch\u2019s nine-hole Chief Egan family course, even if the hardcore golfing contingent have been a little harder to win over. \u201cThe real, real serious golfers, they kind of scoff at it,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cBut they still get their picture taken with the goats. \u201cIt\u2019s been a lot of fun, it really has.\u201d Some animal welfare activists challenged the program when it launched, arguing that goats \u201cwere never made to carry golf bags,\u201d but Campbell insists the caddies enjoy their work. \u201cThese goats want to be around people,\u201d he added. \u201cThey want you to give them a peanut. They want to go out and have a good time with you.\u201d Hole reversal Protecting the rich diversity of flora and fauna across the 140,000-acre ranch is at \u201cthe heart of everything\u201d at Silvies, Campbell says. Around 26,000 cubic yards of soil were moved to sculpt the resort\u2019s two 18-hole links-style championship courses a decade ago, a fraction of the 1 - 1.5 million cubic yards that Campbell estimated is dug up for standard courses. \u201cWe figured when we built it that we had the lowest carbon footprint of any modern course,\u201d Campbell added. The majority of the championship course\u2019s water supply flows down naturally from a large nearby spring, with the remaining third covered by sprinkler pumps. The inhabitants of the some 7,000 bird houses around the fairways are handed the sole responsibility of insect control, meaning no insecticides are used on the courses. That\u2019s plural courses, but golfers may be confused why they can only see one when they pitch up at the Silvies clubhouse. The brainchild of Oregon-based course designer Dan Hixson, they are \u2013 according to Silvies \u2013 the first reversible golf courses seen anywhere in the world since the fabled Old Course in St. Andrews, Scotland, opened almost five centuries ago. Course direction is reversed daily, with all but one of the fairways containing multiple tee grounds, \u201ccreating the opportunity for thousands of unique rounds,\u201d according to their website. It\u2019s another way of reducing the overall carbon footprint, aided by ground staff allowing turf to acclimate to heat and drought in the summer. Occasionally, they will allow the fairways, roughs, and greens to dry out to the point that the grass becomes dormant, before eventually reviving when the soil rehydrates. The goats also play their part in natural course maintenance, chewing their way through the Scottish thistle and gorse that makes up the course\u2019s rough and outer brush. Though they do eat grass, weeds are their preferred snack, meaning they pose little threat to greens and fairways. Not all courses situated within flourishing natural settings are so fortunate \u2013 one Arizona club\u2019s run-in with a squadron of pig-like creatures last year cost it upwards of $200,000 in damages. \u201cFortunately, we don\u2019t have any wild pigs because those are the worst,\u201d Campbell said. Though pronghorn antelope occasionally roam the course, potentially destructive and dangerous elk, black bears and cougars are kept out by a 10-foot fence around the fairway perimeter. The habitats of such animals are preserved by the Oregon Natural Desert Association, a nonprofit supported by tips from golfers to Silvies\u2019 very-own goat caddies.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/goat-caddies-silvies-ranch-resort-spt-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_middleeast_isis-children-detention-syria-intl-cmd", "text": "He had had visitors just once before, years ago when he first arrived in prison at 14. Blindfolded and led into a room by a masked guard, he said he was made to sit on a plastic chair under a cold fluorescent light and questioned by American officials. Stefan Uterloo, now 19, told them he had an uncle in the United States but couldn\u2019t remember where. He suspects they lost interest when they realized he wasn\u2019t American but instead from Suriname, a small, former Dutch colony in South America. Five years later, Uterloo still spends every day with 25 other young men in a single cell in Panorama, a maximum-security prison in northeastern Syria, where CNN interviewed him. Built with funding from the US-led coalition against ISIS and run by the coalition\u2019s ally, the Syrian Democratic Forces or SDF, a Kurdish-led militia, Panorama holds some of the most dangerous ISIS members captured in 2019 after the fall of the group\u2019s so-called caliphate that, at its height, stretched across eastern Syria and western Iraq. Also among the nearly 4,000 ISIS male detainees that the SDF says are held there are an estimated 600 boys and young men detained as boys, according to Amnesty International.\u00a0Like Uterloo, many were brought to Syria, through no fault of their own, by their parents to live under ISIS rule. Now they are coming of age in prison. Many have no idea why they are being held, or what will happen to them. \u201cI don\u2019t know about the big guys,\u201d Uterloo said. \u201cBut if you\u2019re speaking about the kids, and if you want to know the truth, we don\u2019t even know why we are always punished. It\u2019s like five years in this prison \u2026 We don\u2019t even know what we\u2019ve done. We\u2019ve been in prison because of our parents.\u201d The United Nations and rights groups have long warned of the humanitarian and legal crises facing the children of ISIS fighters, who have been kept in camps and detention facilities in northeastern Syria for years. But there has been little consensus on what to do with them. Now, as the US raises the alarm that the militant group is trying to reestablish itself and launch attacks on the West, it is renewing efforts to repatriate fighters and their families to face justice at home. According to Amnesty, the estimated 30,000 children currently held in at least 27 detention facilities and two detention camps \u2013\u00a0Al-Hol and Al-Roj\u00a0\u2013 in northeastern Syria represent the highest concentration of children arbitrarily detained and deprived of their freedom anywhere in the world. CNN was granted extremely rare access inside detention camps and facilities for suspected ISIS fighters and their family members, including Panorama prison. It was the first time the SDF had allowed journalists inside Panorama since 2021 and came just a month after Amnesty released a report accusing the SDF of holding detainees in \u201cinhumane conditions.\u201d The advocacy group cited detainees who said they were subjected to torture and denied access to adequate food and medical care in Panorama, leading to a severe outbreak of tuberculosis inside the prison. The SDF has been quick to dispute the claims of widespread and systematic abuse. Its top commander Mazloum Abdi told CNN that the group\u2019s allegations, \u201care not mirroring the reality.\u201d \u201cInstead of these organizations condemning what we are doing and calling it human rights violations, these organizations should give us help when it comes to our program that we have in place for years,\u201d Mazloum said. In the two cells that CNN was allowed to view under SDF supervision, detainees appeared to be in decent physical condition, sitting cross-legged in clean, recently built, air-conditioned spaces. But the SDF did admit that tuberculosis is rampant in the prison, accounting for five deaths per month, and coughing was audible in the hallways. Officials told CNN that detainees spend up to 23 hours per day in their cells and are held indefinitely without charge. Advocacy groups say the circumstances amount to \u201ca legal black hole,\u201d even worse than the US\u2019 Guantanamo Bay detention facility. \u2018A breeding ground for the next generation of ISIS\u2019 At Al-Hol, a sprawling detention camp of faded tents, rusted barbed wire and wind-swept earth, the scale of the problem reveals itself. There are just over 40,000 people in the camp, where individuals with ISIS affiliations live alongside the displaced, some of them victims of ISIS themselves. A high-security annex holds some 6,700 women and children with links to ISIS fighters from more than 60 countries, who were swept up and dumped in Al-Hol as the SDF cornered and finally defeated the group in its last stronghold, Baghouz in eastern Syria, in 2019. More than half of the camp\u2019s population are children, the majority under 12 years old. Beyond the legal ramifications of their arbitrary and indefinite detention, there are clear security risks as well. Gen. Erik Kurilla, head of the US military\u2019s Central Command, said in a statement after one of his visits to Al-Hol in 2022 that the camp was \u201ca ticking time bomb.\u201d \u201cThis place is a literal breeding ground for the next generation of ISIS,\u201d he said. \u201cThese young people are vulnerable to radicalization given their very poor quality of life.\u201d Speaking to CNN, one senior US government official put it more bluntly: \u201cISIS wants to keep everyone there loyal and primed.\u201d Every month a couple dozen 10- to 15-year-old boys are smuggled out of Al-Hol to ISIS training camps, according to the official. During periodic security raids of Al-Hol, SDF officials say they routinely find cell phone videos of the training, along with horrifying evidence of extrajudicial killings by ISIS supporters. In one video, shared for the first time with CNN, a woman is accused of collaborating with camp administrators. She is beaten and then beheaded inside Al-Hol \u2013 the kind of brutal ISIS extrajudicial punishment that the world hoped it would never see again. The SDF and the US have been pushing countries to repatriate citizens from Syria, telling CNN that it is the only viable solution to this complex and dangerous situation. Al-Hol\u2019s population has been reduced by 42% from a peak of over 73,000 in 2019, according to US officials who say the process has been too slow and many, including close allies which can more easily revoke citizenship than the US, are still dragging their feet. \u201cIt\u2019s unhelpful,\u201d the senior US official told CNN. Complicating matters, the bulk of the camp\u2019s detainees are from countries without any allegiance to the US-led coalition, among them Russians, Chinese Uyghurs and Syrians from regime-held areas, making the prospect of permanently closing Al-Hol unrealistic, at least for now. At the current rate of repatriation, officials say it will at least take an additional seven years to halve the camp\u2019s current population. Taken from their mothers at night As a stopgap, the SDF has introduced an official policy that separates boys at 14 from their mothers, placing them in two purpose-built facilities that it calls \u201crehabilitation\u201d centers. CNN met children as young as 11 in one of the centers, suggesting that camp officials are going beyond that policy. One woman in Al-Hol claimed her 10-year-old son was detained for trying to escape the camp, and that boys are often taken away at age 12. The SDF says the policy is necessary to stop boys from being radicalized by their mothers and to prevent the next generation of ISIS fighters from being born in the camps. They point to the 60 births per month recorded at Al-Hol as proof that young boys are already being married off. But the policy is an absolute breach of international law, according to former UN Special Rapporteur on counterterrorism and human rights Fionnuala N\u00ed Aol\u00e1in. \u201cIt runs us into the area of a war crime,\u201d\u00a0N\u00ed Aol\u00e1in\u00a0told CNN. \u201cThere\u2019s no legal process to justify it \u2026 you must have a court process and taking the child away from a mother is an absolute last resort, when you\u2019ve tried everything else. And it\u2019s neither a last resort nor a legal process, it\u2019s generally a pretty violent, arbitrary process.\u201d \u201cNo one is disputing that the situation in Al-Hol is both suboptimal, dangerous, inappropriate to children, with exposure to structural and direct violence, but it\u2019s also not taking responsibility for the very existence of those camps,\u201d she added. The alternative, say SDF officials, is far worse. Compared to Al-Hol, the Orkesh \u201crehabilitation\u201d center, where some boys and young men are detained, seems like a sanctuary. Its inner courtyard is dominated by a soccer field, where nearly every morning before the day\u2019s blazing heat sets in, Shamil Chakar takes to goal. Chakar is hard to miss. The tall, lanky teenager,\u00a0originally from Cologne, Germany, was taken by his parents to the former capital of ISIS\u2019 self-declared caliphate, Raqqa. He moves with ease on the field, but a shrapnel injury, a large scar from which is still visible on his head, has left him confused. When he sits down to talk, he doesn\u2019t know his own age. But the memory of the night he was taken from Al-Hol by SDF security forces is fresh. \u201cA man came and pulled me up and tied my hand behind my back,\u201d Shamil said. \u201cMy mom was screaming, she said \u2018leave him alone.\u2019 I didn\u2019t want to go with them. He pushed me, saying put on your shoes, but I didn\u2019t. Then he hit me.\u201d Other boys have similar stories of violent separation. All miss their mothers. But their lives have also changed dramatically. At the center, they have rooms with beds, three meals per day and psychological support five days a week. \u2018I would choose an American prison any day\u2019 Second chances are nearly impossible to come by. For those in detention, repentance is demanded, and forgiveness rarely given. But when it does happen, it\u2019s at Al-Roj camp. It is much smaller and more manageable than Al-Hol, and it is where international detainees are transferred before repatriation. In early May, 50-year-old American Brandy Salman and her nine children, aged 7 to 26, along with two young sons of a Minnesota man, left Al-Roj in what was one of the largest repatriations back to the US to date. Roughly a dozen Americans remain in Al-Roj, according to US officials, who are seeking to bring them back. But for now, Hoda Muthana, an American-born woman, isn\u2019t one of them. She has been stuck in Al-Roj for more than five years with her now 7-year-old son. She\u2019s well-known in the camp for being outspoken. She doesn\u2019t wear a face veil and scrawled F-ISIS on the wall outside her tent. Raised in Alabama, she left her family at the age of 20 to live under ISIS after having been drawn in by the group\u2019s propaganda on social media. She became a noted ISIS propagandist herself, cheering their attacks in posts on Twitter, now X, and calling on others to join the self-declared caliphate. Muthana denies personally posting the tweets, telling CNN her phone was taken when she joined ISIS, a decision she deeply regrets. As her son grows older, nearing the age of the forced separation policy, she lives in constant fear for his future. Her American lawyers are continuing to push for her repatriation and that of her son, after the Trump administration revoked her passport on a technicality in 2019 and said that she was not a citizen. Left with few remaining options after the Supreme Court refused to hear her appeal, her legal team has directly petitioned the State Department for a certificate of identity to prove her status. A State Department spokesperson told CNN it had not changed its position regarding Muthana\u2019s citizenship status.\u00a0\u201cHoda Muthana is not a US citizen.\u00a0As the State Department determined and the courts agreed, she is not and never was a US citizen. For privacy reasons, we are unable to provide further comment,\u201d the spokesperson said. Muthana\u2019s lawyer Christina Jump told CNN the department\u2019s stance is hypocritical at best and dishonest at worst. \u201cThe\u00a0US has taken a high and mighty approach in lecturing other countries that they need to repatriate.\u00a0If Hoda Muthana is not a US citizen, then she is stateless and that is a violation of international law and that directly contradicts what the US government has stated that other countries cannot and should not do,\u201d Jump said. \u201cThey also are ignoring completely that at the very least there is a grandchild of US citizens who remains in that camp that they have known about for years now.\u201d Inside a tent surrounded by her son\u2019s toys and books, Muthana told CNN that all she wanted was to go home to the US, even if it meant being in prison. \u201cIf I had any time to serve, I would serve it and I would come out and begin my life with my son,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I were to have the choice between American prison and this camp, I would choose an American prison any day.\u201d CreditsVideo journalist: Scott McWhinnieVideo editors: Oscar Featherstone and Augusta Anthony\ufeffGraphics editor: Lou RobinsonPhoto editor: Sarah TilottaEditors: Eliza Mackintosh and Laura Smith-Spark", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/middleeast/isis-children-detention-syria-intl-cmd/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_style_king-charles-portrait-vandalized", "text": "Activists from an animal rights group have vandalized the first official portrait of King Charles, currently on display in a London gallery. Campaign group Animal Rising posted a video on its social media channels on Tuesday showing two activists using a paint roller to stick signs over the portrait of the monarch. Members of the public have been free to visit the portrait of the monarch, which is on display at the Philip Mould gallery in central London until June 21. The painting, the first official portrait of King Charles as monarch, raised eyebrows when it was unveiled earlier this year. Artist Jonathon Yeo depicted the king against a background of crimson red brush strokes, sparking mixed reactions. Activists covered the king\u2019s head with an image of the British cartoon character Wallace, from the \u201cWallace and Gromit\u201d comedy series. A speech bubble sign was then also tacked onto the painting with the following caption: \u201cNo cheese Gromit, look at all of this cruelty on RSCPA farms.\u201d The action was designed to bring attention to a new report, released on Sunday by the group, which investigated 45 farms whose welfare standards are guaranteed by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA). The RSPCA\u2019s Assured scheme promises that animals in protected farms are given more living space and are never kept in cages. Meat, fish and dairy products produced by these farms are marked with the RSCPA logo. Animal Rising described their findings as \u201cdamning,\u201d alleging that they found \u201csevere animal cruelty\u201d at all farms visited. Last month, King Charles became the royal patron of the RSPCA. In a statement provided to British newspaper The Telegraph, an Animal Rising activist explained, \u201cWith King Charles being such a big fan of \u2018Wallace and Gromit,\u2019 we couldn\u2019t think of a better way to draw his attention to the horrific scenes on RSPCA Assured farms! Even though we hope this is amusing to His Majesty, we also call on him to seriously reconsider if he wants to be associated with the awful suffering across farms being endorsed by the RSPCA.\u201d (During a 2012 engagement at Clarence House for the late Queen Elizabeth\u2019s Diamond Jubilee, Queen Camilla told a group of children of her husband that \u201cWallace and Gromit are his favorite people in the world.\u201d) Animal Rising describes itself as a non-violent organization campaigning for an \u201curgent transition to a sustainable and just plant-based food system.\u201d It is also petitioning for the RSPCA\u2019s Assured scheme, which it says covers up \u201ccruelty on an industrial scale,\u201d to be scrapped. The RSPCA responded to Animal Rising\u2019s claims in a statement provided to CNN on Tuesday, stating that \u201cany concerns about welfare on RSPCA Assured certified farms are taken extremely seriously and RSPCA Assured is acting swiftly to look into these allegations.\u201d \u201cWe have responded openly and transparently to Animal Rising\u2019s challenges to our farming work,\u201d the statement continued. \u201cWhile we understand that Animal Rising, like us, want the best for animals, their activity is a distraction and a challenge to the work we are all doing to create a better world for every animal.\u201d The organization also said it was \u201cshocked\u201d by the vandalism of the painting. \u201cWe welcome scrutiny of our work, but we cannot condone illegal activity of any kind,\u201d their statement read. According to Philip Mould, owner of the gallery where the portrait is on display, the painting sustained \u201cno damage\u201d since it was protected by a layer of Perspex. Mould told CNN the adhesive stickers used by the activists stayed on the portrait for \u201cless than ten seconds.\u201d The activists left the premises after being asked to do so, Mould said, adding that the gallery has also filed a police report. There are currently no plans to curtail the display of the painting, although staff will remain \u201con alert\u201d after the incident, Mould said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/style/king-charles-portrait-vandalized/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "world"}}

In a news briefing Tuesday, the South Korean military\u00a0appeared to downplay the significance of the gunfire, saying the North Korean soldiers quickly retreated and\u00a0did not appear to have the intention of invading the southern side, based on information that cannot be made public. \u201cThere were no unusual movements other than the North Korean army immediately moving north after our warning shots,\u201d said Col.

Lee said the North Korean troops headed back across the Military Demarcation Line (MDL) that runs down the center of the DMZ after the warnings. The shots did not cross over the MDL to the North Korean side of the DMZ, he added. Lee noted that the DMZ area has overgrown forests, and MDL markers are not visible without distinctive paths.

{"id": "2024_06_09_europe_macron-dissolves-french-parliament-europe-intl", "text": "France\u2019s President Emmanuel Macron has dissolved the country\u2019s parliament, the National Assembly, and called a snap election after an exit poll showed his Renaissance party is set to be trounced by the far-right opposition in European parliamentary elections on Sunday. After initial projections, the far-right National Rally (RN) party came out on top with 31.5% of the vote, more than double the share of Renaissance, which scraped into second place on 15.2% of the vote, just ahead of the Socialists in third with 14.3% of the vote. In a celebratory speech after the publication of the exit poll, RN leader Jordan Bardella had called on Macron to dissolve the French parliament, calling the gap between the two parties a \u201cstinging disavowal\u201d for the president. \u201cThis unprecedented defeat for the current government marks the end of a cycle, and Day 1 of the post-Macron era,\u201d Bardella told a raucous audience at RN\u2019s headquarters. Within an hour, Macron made a national address, announcing he would dissolve the French lower house and hold parliamentary elections. The first round will be held on June 30, with a second round on July 7, Macron said. \u201cI have decided to give you back the choice of your parliamentary future by voting. I am therefore dissolving the National Assembly this evening,\u201d Macron said in the shock announcement. \u201cThis decision is serious, heavy. But it is above all, an act of trust. Trust in you, my dear compatriots. In the capacity of the French people to make the most just decision,\u201d the French president added. Under the French system, parliamentary elections are held to elect the 577 members of the lower house, the National Assembly. Separate elections are held to choose the country\u2019s president, which are not scheduled again until 2027. In the last set of parliamentary elections held in 2022, the Ensemble coalition including Macron\u2019s Renaissance party fell short of an overall majority and were forced to seek help from elsewhere. Speaking after Macron\u2019s announcement, Marine Le Pen \u2013 who ran unsuccessfully against Macron for the French presidency in 2017 and 2022, but whose RN party has since enjoyed a resurgence in the polls \u2013 said she welcomed his decision to hold elections. \u201cWe are ready to take power if the French place their trust in us,\u201d said Le Pen, now the parliamentary leader of RN. \u201cWe are ready to rebuild the country, ready to defend the interests of the French, ready to put an end to mass immigration, ready to make the purchasing power of the French a priority, ready to begin the reindustrialization of the country,\u201d she said. Since the beginning of his second term in 2022, Macron has been ruling with a relative majority, forcing him to invoke Article 49.3 of the French constitution several times \u2013 pushing legislation through parliament without a vote, to the increasing displeasure of opposition lawmakers and much of the French public. The last time a French president dissolved parliament was in 1997, which led to Jacques Chirac losing his majority and ushering the Socialists into power under Lionel Jospin. An \u00c9lys\u00e9e source close to Macron, who asked to remain anonymous, told CNN the predicted results showed there is a \u201crepublican majority\u201d in France made up of those who \u201cdon\u2019t agree with the far-right ideas.\u201d \u201cWe should never be afraid of the French people,\u201d the source said. \u201cConvince, convince, convince \u2013 that is the spirit that the presidential majority will take up.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/09/europe/macron-dissolves-french-parliament-europe-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_09_asia_north-korea-balloons-response-intl-hnk", "text": "North Korea has yet again sent hundreds of trash-laden balloons toward its southern neighbor, reigniting a tit-for-tat exchange after South Korean activists sent floating packages in the other direction carrying K-pop and K-dramas on USB sticks. About 330 balloons carrying bags of trash had been sent by North Korea since Saturday night, of which about 80 have landed in South Korea, Seoul\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said on Sunday. Waste paper and plastic were found in the packages and there were no substances hazardous to safety, the JCS said. Around 1,060 balloons from the North have made it into South Korean territory since May 28, according to a CNN tally. South Korea\u2019s National Security Council held an emergency meeting Sunday to discuss responses to the latest wave of balloons. Last week, Pyongyang claimed to have sent a total of 3,500 balloons carrying 15 tonnes of trash to its neighbor, according to state media KCNA, citing North Korea\u2019s Vice Defense Minister Kim Kang Il. The South Korean military responded on Sunday afternoon local time by playing a loudspeaker broadcast into North\u00a0Korea, according to the JCS. South Korea\u2019s military once championed the propaganda broadcasts as part of psychological warfare against the North, until it withdrew the equipment following a 2018 summit between the neighbors. The broadcasts inform North\u00a0Korean soldiers and residents of the \u201creality of North\u00a0Korea,\u201d the development of\u00a0South\u00a0Korea, and\u00a0Korean culture, the JCS said, adding that it is \u201ccapable of immediately performing its mission within a few hours if necessary.\u201d The JCS said that North\u00a0Korea\u00a0is \u201cfully responsible\u201d for the current situation and urged the North to \u201cimmediately stop such mean acts like sending waste balloons.\u201d Whether the military plays another loudspeaker broadcast again is \u201cfully up to North\u00a0Korea\u2019s action,\u201d the JCS warned. Senior North\u00a0Korean official Kim Yo Jong, the sister of leader Kim Jong Un, said Seoul\u2019s resumption of loudspeaker broadcasts were \u201ca prelude to a very dangerous situation,\u201d in a statement carried by KCNA. She also called Pyongyang\u2019s recent balloon activities \u201clegitimate.\u201d The countries\u00a0have been cut off from each other since the\u00a0Korean War ended with an armistice in 1953. They are still technically at war, and the balloon feud has been going on for decades. Groups such as Fighters for a Free North Korea have long sent balloons carrying items prohibited in the isolated totalitarian dictatorship \u2013 including food, medicine, radios, propaganda leaflets and pieces of South Korean news. In May, North Korea responded by sending its own giant balloons south \u2013 containing trash, soil, pieces of paper and plastic, and what South Korean authorities described as \u201cfilth.\u201d Kim said the balloons were \u201cstrictly a responsive act\u201d to South Korea\u2019s years-long practice of sending balloons with anti-North Korea leaflets the other way. The minister said last week that North Korea would \u201ctemporarily halt dropping trash over the border,\u201d but on Thursday South Korean activists sent balloons to their northern neighbor carrying hundreds of thousands of leaflets condemning leader Kim Jong Un and 5,000 USB sticks containing K-pop and K-dramas. South Korea\u2019s JCS said Saturday night that North Korea was \u201cboosting its presumed trash balloons,\u201d and warned that the wind direction may lead to balloons moving south. It advised people to be careful of falling objects, not to touch the fallen balloons, and to report any they find to the nearest military base or to police.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/09/asia/north-korea-balloons-response-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_25_style_zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk", "text": "Above Beijing\u2019s imperial center rises Jingshan, or Prospect Hill. From a pagoda at its modest peak, a panoramic view of the city presents itself. To the south, the dull golden roofs of the Forbidden City crest and fall, pulling the eye southward to Tiananmen \u2014 the Gate of Heavenly Peace \u2014 and the vast square of the same name just beyond. To the east stand the smooth metallic skyscrapers of the city\u2019s business district. To the north, at the top of Beijing\u2019s central axis \u2014 its so-called dragon\u2019s vein \u2014 sit the Bell and Drum Towers, which once acted as the city\u2019s collective timepiece. And stretching all along the western periphery are the calm, tree-lined waters of the manmade lakes, dug by hand for the pleasure of past emperors. It\u2019s this aerial view of \u201cZhongnanhai,\u201d meaning \u201cmiddle and southern seas,\u201d and the surrounding buildings that today\u2019s Chinese leaders prefer you did not see. That\u2019s because the 1,500-acre site of repurposed imperial pavilions and temples, along with gray modern offices has formed the leadership compound for the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP)  since 1950. As the seat of power, Zhongnanhai is often thought of as China\u2019s equivalent to the White House, or the Kremlin. Synonymous with China\u2019s communist party elite, and among the country\u2019s most secretive places, it is ringed by a centuries-old red ochre wall, with countless CCTV cameras periscoping above it \u2014 and patrolled assiduously by security forces in both plain clothes and uniform. A peaceful getaway For Chinese leader Xi Jinping\u2019s imperial forebears, the site served a somewhat different function. While emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties ruled their vast kingdom from within the Forbidden City, they built temples, halls and living quarters in Zhongnanhai; less grandly ceremonial than those of the palace, they were often oriented to take advantage of the views afforded by the area\u2019s tranquil waters and carefully planned gardens. Many of these emperors came to favor passing their days surrounded by drooping willows in the cool and quiet of this cultivated pleasure garden. A story relayed by the scholar Geremie Barm\u00e9 in his book \u201cThe Forbidden City\u201d tells of the 18th-century Qianlong Emperor\u2019s daily routine at Zhongnanhai: Each morning, after a first breakfast of cold swallows nest soup, he would travel by heated palanquin to the gardens\u2019\u00a0Studio of Convivial Delight,\u00a0a pavilion he built to capitalize on the view of the South Lake, where he would breakfast again on a meal of\u00a018 dishes. As the historian and author of \u201cThe Shortest History of China,\u201d Linda Jaivin, told CNN via email: \u201cThere is something outrageous and yet poetic about the incredible coordination and effort required of a team of bearers, cooks and attendants, just so that an emperor could come, catch a view of the magnificent Ocean Terrace, scoff his food and (leave).\u201d The first ruler to view Zhongnanhai as primarily a place to govern from, not simply relax in, was the Empress Dowager Cixi, who effectively controlled China for almost five decades from 1861. She lived for many years in the gardens\u2019 Hall of Ceremonial Phoenixes, which became the center of political authority in China. She would die there in 1908. The serene surroundings of Zhongnanhai also became, under Cixi, a place of punishment and confinement. In 1898, following attempted reforms that displeased her, Cixi imprisoned her nephew, the Guangxu Emperor, on Yingtai Island, which juts out into the southern lake. Built as a miniature version of the mythical Penglai island, home to the immortals of Chinese legend, the tiny piece of land would become the emperor\u2019s home for most of his life, bar a brief period when the Boxer rebellion of 1900 forced the whole court to flee the capital. He would die on Yingtai Island from arsenic poisoning the day before the Empress Dowager herself. His imprisonment and death, said writer M. A. Aldrich, author of \u201cThe Search for a Vanishing Beijing: A Guide to China\u2019s Capital Through the Ages,\u201d perhaps adds a touch of poignancy for any subsequent resident of Zhongnanhai. \u201cIn addition to being a site that preserves sites of imperial splendor,\u201d he told CNN, \u201cit also functions as a reminder to the political elite about the consequences for stepping out of line.\u201d For Aldrich, however, the Zhongnanhai compound also represents the destructive impulses of the CCP towards its adopted capital in the years after 1949, when Mao Zedong proclaimed the foundation of the People\u2019s Republic. \u201cAs a political symbol of the New China, it has been torn up, rebuilt, expanded, and revamped so many times that its connection with its elegant past has been lost,\u201d Aldrich said. Architectural changes There have been serious revisions to the architecture of Zhongnanhai since the end of imperial rule in 1912. After the last emperor abdicated the throne, China\u2019s new president Yuan Shikai granted him the right to live on the northern section of the Forbidden City \u2014 and then took Zhongnanhai to be his new administration\u2019s headquarters. The changes he made to the imperial gardens were disparaged by many of the Westerners who visited them. \u201cWhatever may be one\u2019s opinion as to whether Yuan Shikai \u2018exalted his aim\u2019 in his political career, he certainly cannot be said to have done so as builder and architect,\u201d wrote L.C. Arlington and William Lewisohn in their 1935 book \u201cIn Search of Old Peking,\u201d \u201cfor all the buildings that have been erected or restored by him are in the worst possible taste.\u201d Most notable of these changes \u2014 at least to ordinary Beijingers \u2014 was the repurposing of a two-story pavilion at the very south of the gardens. Known as the Precious Moon Tower, it had been built decades earlier by the Qianlong Emperor for a homesick lover, a Muslim woman from Xinjiang, taken to Beijing as part of the spoils of war. The concubine would gaze south from the tower toward a mock mosque and bazaar the emperor had especially constructed to assuage her longing for home. Yuan refashioned this pavilion into the main entrance to his presidential compound, and established a tall watchtower just to its east. The gate was named Xinhuamen, or the Gate of New China. Today, the structure remains coated in the same deep red that graces the walls of all Beijing\u2019s imperial buildings, with a roof of glazed yellow tiles and detailing that runs below the roofline, picked out in blue and gold. The gate is now flanked by two red banners that speak to its modern purpose as China\u2019s political and party headquarters: \u201cLong Live the Great Communist Party of China\u201d reads one; and \u201cLong Live the Invincible Mao Zedong Thought\u201d on the other. On a screen wall recessed behind the entrance way, Chinese characters written in Mao\u2019s own calligraphic style declare: \u201cServe the People.\u201d Facing out onto Beijing\u2019s main east-west thoroughfare, the gate remains the most conspicuous part of Zhongnanhai. The rest of the compound has, since 1989, been firmly off-limits to the Chinese public. Seat of power Initially, after the communist victory in China\u2019s civil war in 1949, Mao Zedong took up residence at Shuangqing Villa in Fragrant Hills, another former imperial garden to the west of Beijing. Though wary of establishing himself in the imperial heart of Beijing \u2014 it is said that he refused ever to enter the Forbidden City, for fear of being associated with the power structures of old, feudal China he had fought to overthrow \u2014 Mao ultimately moved into Zhongnanhai and, in late 1949, he set up in the\u00a0Garden of Abundant Beneficence,\u00a0a large courtyard compound favored by both the Qianlong and Kangxi emperors, where he would hold court with dignitaries\u00a0and live\u00a0until 1966. Having re-established Zhongnanhai as a center of political power in the new China, Mao set about rebuilding the compound according to his tastes. \u201cSince 1949, an assortment of new architecture styles has encroached into Zhongnanhai, with a tennis court, gymnasium, swimming pools and Western buildings topped off with Chinese eave roofs adding a discordant note that would not have been appreciated by its traditionally-minded original owners,\u201d said Aldrich. In 1966, Mao moved from the Garden of Abundant Beneficence to a specially built house beside his beloved indoor swimming pool. He often summoned officials to speak to him as he bobbed in the water \u2014 and famously received Russian leader Nikita Khrushchev at his pool during a 1958 visit. \u201cTheir interpreters had to pace alongside the edge of the pool,\u201d said Jaivin. \u201cThe Russian couldn\u2019t swim and had to wear water wings. Mao loved both swimming and putting Khrushchev in his place. Finally, Khrushchev got sick of it, and clambered out to sit on the edge, dangling his feet in the water.\u201d In the residence next door, Mao lined his rooms with bookshelves housing an extensive library of Chinese classical literature. \u201cIt was here,\u201d noted Aldrich, \u201cwith the background trappings of a scholar, that he met Nixon and Kissinger in 1972.\u201d Most subsequent leaders have preferred to keep a house outside the Zhongnanhai compound. Deng Xiaoping lived, from 1977, in a courtyard house on a nearby lane adjacent to Beihai, the \u201cNorthern Sea\u201d of central Beijing\u2019s chain of lakes. While not officially disclosed, it is believed that more contemporary leaders, including Xi Jinping and his predecessors Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, have maintained homes in an exclusive gated compound in Jade Spring Hill, sometimes called the \u201cback garden\u201d of Chinese politics, out to the city\u2019s west. Aldrich noted that those leaders and party cadres who used Zhongnanhai as their primary residence often attracted unwelcome scrutiny for their activities, particularly during years of political turbulence. \u201cIn his memoirs, Chairman Mao\u2019s physician, Li Zhisui, commented that (the complex\u2019s) residents were always under surveillance,\u201d Aldrich said. \u201cDuring the Cultural Revolution, the simple act of making a fire would bring down the wrath of the security guards on the perpetrator. It was believed that such a fire was proof that incriminating or seditious materials were being destroyed.\u201d The imperial gardens offering vistas of Zhongnanhai\u2019s lakes have, today, been filled in with dozens of gray offices and meeting halls, many of which date to 1970s, when Zhongnanhai underwent significant razing and renovation \u2014 the rebuilding was so extensive that one visitor in 1979 described the grounds resembling a construction site, with muddy roads that were impossible to walk on. The contemporary compound splits roughly in two, with the northern buildings, on the banks of the \u201cmiddle lake,\u201d used as the headquarters of China\u2019s top executive body, the State Council. It is here that foreign dignitaries are admitted. Around the \u201csouthern lake,\u201d meanwhile, are the headquarters of the CCP, including, within Qinzheng Hall (the Hall of Diligent Government), the offices of the general secretary of the party (a post currently held by Xi). Many of the most historically significant political events to occur at Zhongnanhai have taken place in Huairen Hall, or the Hall of Cherished Compassion, on the western side of the Middle Lake. The hall was added to the imperial park during the late Qing dynasty, but was then extensively remodeled by the CCP in the early 1950s to impart a more august socialist grandeur. It is a broad, imposing ceremonial hall with staggered roofs of glazed green tiles falling in curved lines to upturned corners; the facade of austere grey brick is interrupted by red wooden pillars, windows and doors. The building\u2019s capacious interior houses a large auditorium, as well as numerous smaller meeting rooms. The hall has, for decades, served as the main meeting place for China\u2019s Politburo, the party\u2019s decision-making body usually comprising about two dozen members. On occasion, it has also hosted the Politburo\u2019s Standing Committee, the core of China\u2019s political elite, (the power of both bodies has notably dwindled in the era of Xi), though they most commonly meet in Qinzheng Hall, close to the general secretary\u2019s office. During the tumult of the Cultural Revolution vital discussions and debates occurred at Huairen Hall, and, in the months after its conclusion, it was there that three of the so-called Gang of Four \u2014 the political faction that included Mao\u2019s wife held responsible for the worst excesses of the era \u2014 were arrested, tricked into attending a meeting they thought was about the publication of the fifth volume of Mao\u2019s Selected Works. In April 1989, former party head Hu Yaobang suffered a heart-attack during a Politburo meeting at Huairen; his death a week later would trigger the Tiananmen Square protests that the government forcibly cracked down on in early June of that year. However, the compound hasn\u2019t always been so forbidden for the masses following the collapse of China\u2019s imperial dynasty. In the late 1920s, it became a park, with tourists allowed to boat on and swim in the lakes, while in the 1980s, the public could access some of its scenic and historical spots, including\u00a0Mao\u2019s\u00a0former residence, on\u00a0organized weekend tours.\u00a0Even early in 1989, a journalist for the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0was able to casually\u00a0drive\u00a0a senior official into the compound and drop him off inside.\u00a0During a period of warmer US and China relations in 2011, former Chinese president\u00a0Hu Jintao\u00a0invited\u00a0a group of American high school students to Zhongnanhai. Modern security concerns Today, Zhongnanhai is more closely-guarded than ever, though the inexorable development of the city has caused problems in maintaining the compound\u2019s secrecy. When an annex to the nearby Beijing Hotel was built in\u00a01973, authorities were panicked by the realization that from its upper floors one could quite easily see \u2013 and potentially target a sniper rifle \u2013 into Zhongnanhai. A building was hastily erected on the western edge of the Forbidden City to restrict this view. Likewise in 2018, when Beijing\u2019s new tallest building was\u00a0completed\u00a0\u2013 the 528-meter Citic tower, better known as the \u201cZun\u201d \u2013 the country\u2019s national security apparatus reportedly requisitioned the top floors amid fears that visitors or occupants might be able to spy into the compound. Beijing authorities did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on the security situation at the time. Zhongnanhai\u2019s entrance, Xinhuamen, has also been the site of repeated demonstrations in recent decades; in 1989, it was a gathering point for students taking part in the Tiananmen protests, whilst in 1999, more than 10,000 members of the since-banned Falun Gong gathered on the sidewalks near Zhongnanhai to protest their treatment at the hands of the government. So, while Zhongnanhai is sometimes compared to the White House, Aldrich argues that the paranoia with which the compound is today guarded makes it more like the imperial palace of centuries past: \u201cSince ordinary people are not allowed to enter Zhongnanhai, it is probably more appropriate to describe it as a \u2018New Forbidden City\u2019 for China\u2019s ruling elite rather than a place with a personal political resonance for the average citizen,\u201d he said. \u201cHeck, even the Kremlin is open to tourists!\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/style/zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_10_tech_hospital-cyberattack-google-microsoft", "text": "Microsoft and Google will offer free or discounted cybersecurity services to rural hospitals across the United States to make them less vulnerable to cyberattacks that have disrupted patient care and threatened lives, the White House and those tech firms said Monday. Microsoft said in a statement to CNN that it would provide free security updates for eligible rural hospitals, as well as security assessments and training for hospital staff. Google will provide free cybersecurity advice to rural hospitals and start a pilot program to match the firm\u2019s cybersecurity services with the needs of rural hospitals. The nation\u2019s roughly 1,800 rural community hospitals are among the most vulnerable to dangerous ransomware attacks because they often lack IT security resources and cybersecurity-trained staff. And they may be the only hospitals within dozens of miles, meaning a ransomware attack that prevents a hospital from accepting ambulances can put patients\u2019 lives at risk. The new announcement is\u00a0the result of private discussions between the tech firms and officials at the White House National Security Council who have growing increasingly concerned about cyber threats to hospitals. It\u2019s an effort to use the broad reach of Microsoft and Google\u2019s software, which is used in hospitals across the United States, to help plug a gap in the defense of the health care sector. \u201cWe\u2019re in new territory as we see \u2026 this wave of attacks against hospitals,\u201d Anne Neuberger, the top cyber official at the White House National Security Council, told reporters on Sunday. The Biden administration is also preparing to issue minimum cybersecurity requirements for US hospitals. The details of that proposal have yet to be finalized. But the American Hospital Association, which represents hospitals across the United States, opposes the proposal, saying it would impose penalties on the victims of cyberattacks after they are hacked. A growing problem The number of ransomware attacks against the US healthcare sector increased by 128% in 2023 compared to 2022,\u00a0according to data\u00a0released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. And recent ransomware attacks have brought the sector\u2019s vulnerability into sharp relief. A February ransomware attack on a major health insurance billing firm\u00a0cut off health providers\u00a0from billions of dollars and put some health clinics on the brink of bankruptcy. UnitedHealth Group, whose subsidiary was hacked, paid a $22 million ransom to the hackers to try to recover patient data. One third of Americans may have had their data stolen. Another ransomware attack, in May, on one of America\u2019s largest hospital chains,\u00a0put patients\u2019 lives in danger\u00a0as nurses were forced to manually enter prescription information, multiple nurses at affected hospitals told CNN. The FBI and its international allies have conducted a series of crackdowns on ransomware gangs, seizing the computers they use and unlocking some of the victim computers that hackers have encrypted. But ransomware remains a flourishing business, in part, US officials say, because many of its perpetrators operate with impunity from Russia. The health care sector is a particularly enticing target because hospitals under duress to restore patient services\u00a0are sometimes willing\u00a0to pay the ransom. \u201cWe do see a much more permissive environment in Russia by both hacktivists and criminals, and it\u2019s of concern,\u201d Neuberger, the White House official, told reporters. \u201cWe also see more and more companies paying ransoms. And every ransom payment feeds the beast and drives further attacks.\u201d Cleveland cyberattack shuts City Hall Cyberattacks have frequently shut down other vulnerable services. The\u00a0City of Cleveland is\u00a0investigating a cyber incident, according to a statement from mayor Justin\u00a0Bibb. As a precaution, the city said it closed City Hall Monday, and it will keep City Hall closed Tuesday. Cleveland also shut down all of its internal systems and software. But city and emergency services like the Department of Public Safety, 911, police, the fire department, ambulances and the Department of Public Utilities, will remain operational, Bibb\u2019s office said. However, the mayor said the emergency services are functioning with limited IT capabilities. \u201cOver the weekend, the city identified some abnormalities,\u201d Commissioner Kimberly\u00a0Roy-Wilson, with the city\u2019s Division of Information Technology Services, said. \u201cWe have moved into our protocols and procedures with regards to containment and we are now investigating the nature and scope of those abnormalities.\u201d Bibb would not say how many or which agencies are helping with the investigation.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/tech/hospital-cyberattack-google-microsoft/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "world"}}

The aircraft went missing after it failed to land at the Mzuzu International Airport, about 380 km (240 miles) to the north of the capital Lilongwe. The wreckage of the plane has been located, Chakwera said in an address to the nation. \u201cThe search and rescue operation I ordered to find the missing plane that carried our vice president and nine others has been completed. The plane has been found. And I am deeply saddened and sorry to inform you that it has turned out to be a terrible tragedy,\u201d Chakwera\u00a0said. The Malawian leader disclosed that the aircraft was found \u201ccompletely destroyed\u201d near a hill in the Chikangawa\u00a0Forest in northern Malawi, adding that \u201cwords cannot describe how heartbreaking this is.\u201d Chakwera paid tribute to his deputy, describing him as \u201ca good man, a devoted father and husband, (and) a patriotic citizen who served his country with distinction.\u201d \u201cHis passing is a terrible loss to his wife, Mary, his family, his friends, his colleagues in the cabinet and to all of us as a nation,\u201d Chakwera said in his address from the Malawian capital. The president also mourned the loss of the other passengers onboard. The Malawian leader highlighted the tragic nature of the accident, telling journalists that he had himself previously traveled on the same aircraft. \u201cYet despite the track record of the aircraft and the experience of the crew, something terrible went wrong with that aircraft on its flight back to Lilongwe,\u201d he added. On Monday evening, the president had told journalists that air traffic control had advised the vice president\u2019s plane against trying to land, and recommended turning back to the capital due to poor visibility. Not long after, the authorities lost contact with the aircraft, and started a search operation. Earlier on Tuesday, the Malawi Defence Force said it had deployed drones and at least 200 soldiers to search for the plane at the Chikangawa\u00a0Forest reserve where signals of its whereabouts were last received. The Force Commander Paul Valentino Phiri said rescue operations had been delayed by bad weather conditions. The vice president and nine other victims will all be laid to rest in \u201ca dignified manner,\u201d Chakwera said. Their remains arrived in the capital Tuesday evening and were received by Chakwera, live visuals showed. The country will observe a 21-day national mourning for Chilima and the other officials killed in the crash. The mourning period will start on June 11 and last until July 1, according to a statement from the president\u2019s office. United Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said he was \u201cvery saddened\u201d to hear of the plane crash. \u201cWe offer condolences to their families and we stand with the people of Malawi at this sad time,\u201d he said. Chilima, 51, had arrived back in\u00a0Malawi\u00a0on June 6 after attending the Korea-Africa\u00a0Summit in Seoul last week. He first served as deputy to former President Peter Mutharika between 2014 and 2019 before being sworn in as vice president for a second time in 2020. An economist, Chilima previously headed Airtel Malawi, the first Malawian to lead the telecommunications company. \u201cI consider it one of the greatest honors of my life to have had him as my deputy and counsellor for the past four years,\u201d President Chakwera said.

{"id": "2024_06_11_style_spinel-tourmaline-gemstones", "text": "In 2016, jeweler Olivia Young of Ouroboros sold a red spinel ring for \u00a36,000 ($7,700). Last year, the client\u2019s insurance company paid out \u00a330,000 ($38,400) to replace it. Experts say that this previously overlooked gemstone is rocketing in desirability and value, as collectors look beyond the so-called \u201cBig Four\u2019\u201d (diamonds, emeralds, rubies and sapphires) for more affordable, niche gemstones that may just be a shrewd investment. Found in Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Vietnam, Afghanistan, Tajikistan and some African countries, spinels come in a range of colors, from vivid blue, pink and red to dusky grey, green and purple. Until they were properly identified in the 18th century, red spinels were called rubies; the 170-carat Black Prince\u2019s Ruby at the front of the Imperial State Crown, part of the British Crown Jewels, is in fact a spinel. In 2015, the auction house Bonhams sold the 50.13-carat Hope Spinel for a world-record \u00a3962,500 ($1.22m) \u2014 over six times its estimate \u2014 helping to catapult the stone into public consciousness. \u201cHistorically, spinels have been regarded as less important and therefore more affordable, but they are becoming increasingly desirable,\u201d said Jennifer Tonkin, Bonhams co-head of jewelry, over email. She noted that \u201cfire-engine red\u201d and hot-pink spinels from Burma, as well as rose-pink examples from Tajikistan, are most sought after by connoisseurs. Rahul Kadakia, international head of jewelry at Christie\u2019s, agreed that pink and purple spinels \u201cshould continue to see market appreciation,\u201d and shared that fine examples sell for up to $25,000 per carat. \u201cThe escalating prices of the \u201cbig four\u201d gems have compelled buyers to explore unconventional alternatives,\u201d he said in an email, but explained that appreciation of spinels\u2019 rich colors is no new phenomenon. \u201cThey were, after all, one of the favorite gems of Mughal rulers.\u201d A matter of ethics London-based jeweler Lily Gabriella features spinels in myriad shades in her one-off collectors\u2019 edition designs. She has seen a \u201cnotable increase\u201d in their price, reflecting \u201cboth their aesthetic appeal and their rarity\u201d she said via email, adding that spinels are \u201coften sourced from small-scale operations, presenting fewer ethical concerns compared to other stones.\u201d Charles Abouchar, director of Abouchar SA, a Geneva-based dealer who exhibits at the trade show Gem Gen\u00e8ve, said that rising demand for colored gemstones has led to a shortage of quality specimens, driving up prices. \u201cAs rubies, sapphires, and emeralds have become very expensive and scarce, people have begun buying other gemstones that were previously more affordable, causing prices to rise significantly,\u201d he said over email. \u201cSpinels and Paraiba tourmalines have seen a steady increase in demand over the last decade.\u201d Originally discovered in the 1980s in a now-exhausted mine in the Brazilian state of Paraiba, this once-niche variety of tourmaline is distinctive for its electric turquoise color, the result of traces of copper. Experts posit that only one Paraiba tourmaline is mined for every 10,000 diamonds \u2014 and while similar hues are found in Madagascar, the scarcity of Brazilian stones has seen prices soar. At Bonhams, Tonkin said prices for top-quality Paraiba tourmalines reached $75,000 per carat in 2022, compared with $4,800 per carat in 2009. Roberto Boghossian, Managing Partner of the jewelry house Boghossian, added that the price of Paraiba tourmalines has doubled in the last three to five years, which he attributes to their \u201crarity, beauty and enduring appeal,\u201d describing their neon glow as \u201ca refreshing alternative to more traditional gemstones.\u201d Moti Ferder, founder of Lugano Diamonds, began working with Paraiba tourmalines over 20 years ago. \u201cThere is an undeniable attraction to them \u2014 they are very rare and absolutely mesmerizing,\u201d he said in an email. Ferder foresees continued growth in value as demand increases and supply diminishes, \u201cmaking it one of the market\u2019s most coveted and prized gemstones.\u201d So, what if you\u2019re already priced out of the market for a Paraiba? Olivia Young is buying as much tourmaline from Afghanistan as she can, because these newer deposits offer \u201cincredibly beautiful bi-chrome material that\u2019s blue-green in one direction and grass-green at 90 degrees,\u201d describing them as \u201cthe most exquisite and vibrant gemstones I have ever seen.\u201d Likewise, gemmologist and founder of Minka Jewels Lucy Crowther counts blue-green tourmalines as the connoisseur\u2019s choice, having personally discovered them in India 15 years ago. \u201cThese incredibly vibrant, clean gemstones really stirred something in me,\u201d she explained\u00a0in an email. Now, she sources top-quality examples for unconventional engagement rings and colorful cocktail rings. \u201cWith lab-grown diamonds becoming increasingly popular, colored stones are a great choice for those wanting to stand out and have something natural that is also unique.\u201d Crowther and Young are both determined to educate clients that there\u2019s more to life than the Big Four. \u201cI believe across the board, that tourmalines of top-quality material and significant sizes will sky-rocket,\u201d said Young. \u201cThere is a finite amount of the incredible material and it is exceptionally beautiful, so I can only see its popularity exploding.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/style/spinel-tourmaline-gemstones/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_10_tech_tesla-self-driving-cars-china-hnk-intl", "text": "Tesla is one step closer to launching full-self driving (FSD) technology in China after it clinched an agreement with Baidu to upgrade its mapping software. The Chinese tech giant said Saturday that it was providing lane-level navigation services for Tesla cars. Baidu (BIDU) says this level of navigation can provide drivers with detailed information, including making lane recommendations ahead of upcoming turns, to enhance safety. Experts said during Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk\u2019s surprise visit to China at the end of April that one of his main hurdles in securing government approval to rollout the company\u2019s FSD software was reaching a mapping and navigation deal with Baidu. \u201cWith the support of Baidu\u2019s lane-level map, Tesla\u2019s navigation can accurately render lane changes on the road the user is currently on, upgrading from providing road-level guidance to providing lane-level guidance,\u201d Baidu said in the statement. China\u2019s answer to Google has been been providing mapping services to Tesla since 2020. But prior to Saturday\u2019s announcement, its services had been limited to \u201croad-level\u201d information, which is less precise than lane-level navigation. A day earlier, Tesla launched its new software upgrade for users in urban areas in China, the world\u2019s biggest car market, saying in a statement on WeChat that such detailed road information was being made available \u201cfor the first time.\u201d CNN has reached out to Tesla for comment. On Monday, Baidu declined further comment. Virtually all Teslas have a driver-assistance system called Autopilot, while the more robust FSD feature comes at a premium price. Autopilot is available in China, but not the full FSD feature. Teaming up with Baidu would remove an obstacle, as the Chinese firm has key mapping credentials that can be applied to driver-assistance functions. According to Chinese regulations, all self-driving systems must obtain mapping qualifications before operating on public roads. Foreign car companies need to partner with licensed Chinese companies to qualify for surveying and mapping. Partnering with Baidu would allow Tesla to run its full self-driving system on China\u2019s public roads, with its vehicles able to collect surrounding data, such as road layout, traffic signs and buildings. It could also accelerate Tesla\u2019s global development of its self-driving technology, as data from China could be used to train Tesla\u2019s algorithms needed for fully autonomous vehicles. Car owners have long complained on social media about Tesla\u2019s previous navigation services, which were also provided by Baidu, saying they often have to rely on other maps available on smartphones while driving. \u201cThis time, you can really remove your mobile phone holders (mounted in the car),\u201d Tesla said in its Friday announcement, suggesting drivers no longer need other maps for navigation. The news went viral on Chinese social media on Monday. \u201cAfter the system upgrade, I no longer need to use my mobile phone to navigate,\u201d said one Weibo user. \u201cTesla\u2019s (own) navigation system can finally be used.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u201d Introducing the FSD system could provide a revenue boost to Tesla, which is having a tough time in China. In April, it slashed prices across its car product lines in the country, hoping to bolster sales in the face of slowing demand and increased competition.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/tech/tesla-self-driving-cars-china-hnk-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_04_10_style_graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers", "text": "Climbing up abandoned, unfinished floors and tightrope walking across balcony ledges, backpacks clanging with cans of alkyd and acrylic, a collective of Los Angeles graffiti artists have transformed their craft beyond urban aesthetics to champion community issues. Their choice of canvas: Oceanwide Plaza in Downtown LA. Occupying over a full square city block, the plaza was imagined as a vast mixed-use building project, offering city residents over 500 lavish condominiums, a five-star hotel, retail spaces, restaurants and a private 2-acre park. However, construction on the $1 billion project, which began in 2015, was shelved after the Chinese-backed contractor Oceanwide Holdings ran out of funding\u00a0in 2019 \u2014 and it has lain unfinished ever since. The plaza\u2019s status \u2014 and potential \u2014 as an eye-catching venue for their work spread by word of mouth within the graffiti community in recent months. Security at the site was known to be lax, an important detail as accessing the plaza\u2019s towers and other buildings constitutes trespassing. (The Los Angeles City Attorney confirmed to CNN that, as of April 3, criminal charges have been filed against 23 individuals, for violations including trespassing and possession of vandalism tools.) \u201cIt was like a gift from the graffiti gods\u2026 A giant canvas in the middle of downtown,\u201d tagger ENDEM told CNN, speaking on behalf of himself and his graffiti crew, NCT. \u201cWe were like, \u2018Let\u2019s do it right. Let\u2019s do it as if the whole world is going to see this.\u2019\u201d Historically, graffiti has often been used as protest art. While the practice dates back thousands of years, it\u2019s most commonly viewed in a contemporary context (within graffiti\u2019s \u201cmodern\u201d era, which dates back to the 1960s and 70s) as a creative vehicle for challenging societal norms and inequities \u2014 whether on the Berlin Wall in Germany or subway cars in New York City; whether painted by anonymous artists or well-known figures like Keith Haring or Banksy, even if the latter is, technically, anonymous himself. Still, neither ENDEM nor any of the other artists involved realized how famous their work on the Oceanside towers would become. Sharing his artwork on Instagram on January 31, a video from ENDEM quickly racked up tens of thousands of views: Vibrant images of bright block lettering splayed across the building\u2019s exterior paired with footage from the inside \u2014 the artist posing with shots of his spray paint cans, poised above the cityscape. The viral footage, among other visuals shared on social media, quickly opened the floodgates. Hitting Oceanside became a mark of credibility in the graffiti world; by mid-February, the number of tags and other graffiti pieces there were multiplying overnight. \u201cIt was an open house people going in and out. It was beautiful. It was like graffiti paradise,\u201d ENDEM said. \u201cIt felt exactly like the streets, but concentrated.\u201d Transformed in part into an art installation, Oceanwide became an opportunity for the graffiti artists to leave a message to the city below, and a call-out to policy makers who leave buildings to rot. \u201cGraffiti shows you where the city hurts,\u201d Roger Gastman, owner and founder of the LA-based arts organization Beyond the Streets, told CNN. Renowned for its large-scale exhibitions, immersive educational programs, pop-up events and partnerships, Beyond the Streets works to educate and celebrate the diverse dimensions of graffiti as a medium. To him, the mission of graffiti is clear: to challenge, educate, and redefine public perception of the medium. Earl Ofari Hutchinson, president of The Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable, a nonpartisan public policy forum\u00a0for civic participation and education,\u00a0sees the abandoned towers as amplifying the social issues of the community they are situated in, connecting the graffiti-laden structures to the urban blight that surrounds them in LA\u2019s Skid Row. Skid Row is a 50-block sector of downtown LA where between 8,000 and 11,000 unhoused people live in challenging, often squalid conditions. \u201cYou\u2019ve got tens of thousands of people displaced because of over urban development. And as a result of that, they\u2019re on the streets,\u201d Hutchinson told CNN, noting that the homeless population in Los Angeles is continuing to grow. (The Los Angeles Housing Services Authority reports a 9% increase in homelessness in LA county in 2023 and a 10% increase in the city from 2022.) \u201cNow, set right in the middle of that, you have\u2026 a development that will never be completed.\u201d \u201cWhat you have here is a classic urban nightmare brought on by very poor policies \u2014 fiscal, financial, budgetary and political problems (in) a city that has just gone off the rails in terms of over-development and lack of affordability,\u201d Hutchinson added. Still, Hutchinson is no fan of the graffiti either. To him, and many other LA residents who have said they disapprove of the \u201cvandalism,\u201d the plaza is a sore sight for eyes. \u201cThe problem is you\u2019re talking about violating public space and with no permission\u2026 that doesn\u2019t fly with me,\u201d Hutchinson said. \u201cThe fact of the matter is, the public has not given you approval. (And) the general public has to pay for the removal.\u201d Costs currently borne by the taxpayer at the Oceanwide Plaza site include the security details provided by the LAPD as well as the graffiti cleanup Hutchinson highlights. (\u201cThis has strained our deployment,\u201d LAPD Chief Michel Moore said during a February meeting of the Los Angeles City Council. \u201cWe have called in some officers on an overtime basis so that we can provide for these added patrols or station them at that site to deter vandals and others from gaining access.\u201d) Clean teams working in the neighborhoods surrounding Oceanwide remove on average some 2,000 square feet of graffiti per week, with that figure growing in recent months. \u201cPeople forget that people live here. People own businesses here and they don\u2019t want to have to spend the time and money to clean it up,\u201d said Blair Besten, executive director of the Historic Core of Downtown Los Angeles, an organization which works to improve the quality of life in downtown neighborhoods. The Historic Core prioritizes street sweeping, trash collection \u2014 and graffiti removal. \u201cI would hardly call what they\u2019re doing art,\u201d Besten argued of the Oceanwide taggers. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty sloppy and quick. They come in fast and they knock it out and they leave.\u201d But to Gastman, graffiti is a powerful form of expression, and a call-to-action \u2014 particularly for those who emanate from struggles within home life, gang life or societal turmoil. Graffiti culture can offer an unexpected support system for those the city has abandoned, Gastman said. It becomes a platform for them to make their voices heard. \u201cIn graffiti culture, a lot of us know each other. We\u2019re all friends. We have the same mentality \u2014 we\u2019re just trying to get up. We\u2019re just trying to get noticed,\u201d explained ENDEM. In the midst of an addiction that led to his rock bottom, graffiti became his lifeline, he explained. \u201cI was at my lowest of lows, still trying to stay sober, I needed some type of outlet,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cGraffiti is something that you can hold on to. Its bigger than me, its everyone, it\u2019s a community.\u201d In this, ENDEM believes that the beauty of Oceanwide isn\u2019t tangible. Rather, it lies in the birth of a new generation of graffiti writers. \u201cThey can erase the graffiti on buildings, but they can never erase the impact that it has on the city of Los Angeles and the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to it. Yes, it\u2019s vandalism. Yes, it\u2019s art, and it\u2019s everything in between,\u201d Gastman concluded. \u201cThis is a real culture. It\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/10/style/graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_07_americas_panama-migrants-darien-gap-intl-latam", "text": "Panamanian figures show at least 174,513 migrants crossed the treacherous Dari\u00e9n Gap, a mountainous rainforest region connecting South and Central America, from January to June 6 of this year. The latest figures are higher than around the same period in 2023, when more than 166,000 crossings were reported, according to Panama\u2019s National Migration Service. The Dari\u00e9n Gap, which a decade ago was seen as an almost impassable barrier, has continued to see an increase in the number of migrants willing to risk their lives and safety to cross it. According to migration service figures, a record 520,000 people crossed the jungle last year. Experts say many continue to journey towards the United States in search of better opportunities. The National Migration Service of Panama said Thursday that in the first six days of June 2024, at least 4,499 people \u2013 3,598 adults and 901 minors \u2013 arrived in the country. This comes as the number of children crossing the Dari\u00e9n Gap has increased by 40% this year, putting the route on track to see record levels of child migration for the fifth consecutive year, according to a report by the United Nations\u2019 children\u2019s agency. The UNICEF report added that in the first four months of 2024, over 30,000 children crossed the Dari\u00e9n Gap, and that 2,000 were unaccompanied or separated from their families. This comes as Panamanian politicians seek to harden the country\u2019s borders. During his election campaign, Panama\u2019s president-elect Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino said that he wanted to \u201cclose the Dari\u00e9n,\u201d citing safety concerns. He explained in early May that he had proposed to initiate \u201ca repatriation process with full respect for human rights\u201d for the hundreds of thousands of migrants who pass through the area each year. \u201cSo that those from there, and those who would like to come, know that those who arrive here will be returned to their country of origin,\u201d Mulino said. Mulino\u2019s plan may prove unfeasible given that the jungle is 266 kilometers (165 miles) long. Discouraging migrants from crossing could be a tough challenge since many of them pay human smugglers operating on both sides of the borders. \u201cIn practical terms, trying to reduce migration through the Dari\u00e9n is a difficult task. The complexity is not just about entry points, but how to manage and have better information on who is helping migrants get through,\u201d Ariel Ruiz, a policy analyst at the Washington-based Migration Policy Institute, told CNN. The 66-mile (106-kilometer) hike through the Darien Gap brings migrants from Colombia to Panama and is a crucial passage for those hoping to reach the United States and Canada. Mass migration across the Western Hemisphere has\u00a0fueled a growing number\u00a0of people moving north. The journey carries multiple risks for migrants, including robberies, assaults, kidnappings, diseases, wild animal attacks, and accidents in a jungle full of rivers, mountains, and mud flats, according to the UN Refugee agency, UNHCR.

Fighters from the Rapid Support Forces (RSF)\u00a0plundered the facility on Saturday stealing an ambulance among other supplies, the aid agency said. \u201cOn Saturday, MSF and the Ministry of Health suspended all activities in South Hospital, El Fasher, North Darfur, after RSF soldiers stormed the facility, opened fire, and looted it, including stealing an MSF ambulance,\u201d MSF Sudan said on social media Saturday. The hospital was the only one in the region \u201cequipped to deal with mass casualties\u201d and \u201cwas the main referral hospital for treating war-wounded.\u201d It was also one of the two hospitals in El Fasher with surgical capacity, according to MSF. As a result, patients are being moved to Paediatric and Saudi hospitals \u201cwhich were unprepared for such an influx,\u201d it added. The NGO added on X, formerly known as Twitter, there were only ten patients and a reduced medical team at the hospital at the time. Medical teams had already began transferring patients and services to other facilities earlier in the week due to intensified fighting in the region, it added. CNN has reached out to the RSF for comment. MSF said most patients and the remaining medical team, which included all MSF staff, were able to flee the violence but they are unable to say for certain if there were any casualties due to the chaos that ensued. The medical facility had already been hit by mortar shells and bullets multiple times in the preceding weeks between May 25th\u00a0and June 3rd\u00a0resulting in two deaths and 14 injuries among patients and caretakers, according to MSF. \u201cIt is outrageous that the RSF opened fire inside the hospital. This is not an isolated incident, as staff and patients have endured attacks on the facility for weeks from all sides, but opening fire inside a hospital crosses a line,\u201d said MSF\u2019s Head of Emergencies Michel Lacharite, as quoted by MSF Sudan on X Saturday. \u201cWarring parties must halt attacks on medical care. Hospitals are closing. Remaining facilities can\u2019t handle mass casualties. We are trying to find solutions.

Civil war in Sudan between the SAF and RSF broke out in April 2023.

{"id": "2024_06_09_middleeast_benny-gantz-resignation-post-war-plan-gaza-intl-latam", "text": "Israeli war cabinet member Benny Gantz has resigned from Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government, delivering a blow to the prime minister who has been celebrating the rare rescue of hostages held in Gaza. \u201cNetanyahu prevents us from moving forward to a real victory [in Gaza],\u201d Gantz said in a televised statement Sunday in which he described leaving the government as a \u201ccomplex and painful\u201d decision. \u201cThat is why we are leaving the emergency government today with a heavy heart, but with a whole heart,\u201d he said. Gantz \u2013 considered Netanyahu\u2019s main political challenger \u2013 said he was quitting eight-months after the October 7 Hamas attacks because \u201cthe situation in the country and in the decision-making room has changed.\u201d He accused Netanyahu of putting his own personal political considerations ahead of a post-war strategy for the Gaza Strip, claiming that \u201cfateful strategic decisions are met with hesitancy and procrastination due to political considerations,\u201d and urged the prime minister to hold an election in the coming months. \u201cI call on Netanyahu: set an agreed election date. Do not let our people be torn apart,\u201d Gantz said. The decision by Gantz fulfils an ultimatum he gave the prime minister last month calling on him to lay out a new plan for the war against Hamas by June 8. Gantz had been expected to resign on Saturday, but postponed the announcement following news that Israeli forces had rescued four hostages in an operation Gazan officials said left more than 270 Palestinians dead. His resignation comes despite Netanyahu calling on Gantz to stay in Israel\u2019s emergency government, saying this is the time for unity, not division. Following Gantz\u2019s announcement, Netanyahu urged him to change his mind. \u201cBenny, this is not the time to abandon the campaign \u2013 this is the time to join forces,\u201d Netanyahu said to Gantz in a post on X. \u201cCitizens of Israel, we will continue until victory and all the goals of the war have been achieved, most importantly, the release of all our hostages and the elimination of Hamas,\u201d Netanyahu said. Netanyahu said his door remained open to any political party that is ready to share in the burden of fighting the war against Hamas, and will \u201chelp bring victory over our enemies and ensure the security of our citizens.\u201d Gantz\u2019s decision does not put Netanyahu\u2019s government in immediate danger \u2013 his party was not part of the prime minister\u2019s coalition, which retains a majority with 64-seats in the 120-member Knesset, Israel\u2019s parliament. It would however leave the war cabinet, set up four days after Hamas\u2019 October 7 attack, without representation from any party other than Netanyahu\u2019s Likud. Besides the prime minister, the only other remaining member of the emergency government with decision-making power is Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, also from Likud. (Though following Gantz\u2019s announcement, the far-right Israeli National Security Minister Ben Gvir demanded to join the war cabinet). Gantz\u2019 decision comes as Netanyahu faces growing calls from Israel\u2019s Western allies and families of hostages held in Gaza to end the war and bring back the captives. Eight months since the war started, Israel is yet to achieve its stated objectives as most of Hamas\u2019 top leadership remains at large and more than 100 hostages are held in the enclave. The United States has repeatedly called on the prime minister to present a tangible post-war plan for Gaza. US President Joe Biden, who laid out a three-pronged Israeli peace deal proposal last week, has suggested that Netanyahu is likely benefiting from prolonging the conflict. Gantz, a 64-year-old former defense minister, said last month that Netanyahu should submit a plan that should include the elimination of Hamas, the return of hostages from Gaza, the establishment of an alternative government in the enclave, the return of displaced Israelis from the north of the country, and a plan to make progress on normalization with Saudi Arabia. Netanyahu had rejected Gantz\u2019s threat, saying his ultimatum would harm Israel. In April, Gantz called for early elections to be held as soon as September, ahead of the one-year anniversary of the war, saying \u201cIsraeli society needs to renew its contract with its leadership.\u201d Gantz often surpasses the prime minister in popularity, according to opinion polls. A survey published Friday by the Israeli Maariv newspaper showed support for Gantz at 42%, compared to 34% for Netanyahu. The war cabinet, which Gantz was a member of, operates independently from the broader Israeli government. It is responsible for making decisions related to the fighting in Gaza. \u201cHe (Gantz) joined the government four days after October 7 in order to balance things out with the far right, prevent reckless decision-making,\u201d Alon Pinkas, a former Israeli diplomat, wrote in Israel\u2019s Haaretz newspaper. \u201cIn his mind, he was the responsible adult in a government filled with inept and messianic misfits.\u201d As the war dragged on, with displaced residents of northern Israel unable to return home and hostages remaining captive in Gaza, Gantz may have realized he would lose popularity by staying in the cabinet, Pinkas said. \u201cThe longer Gantz remains in the government, the weaker Gantz will get,\u201d Pinkas wrote. \u201cThe more identical his positions are to those of the prime minister, the more he\u2019ll lose on both sides. Right-wingers will return home and centrists will seek other options.\u201d This is a developing story.

The convicted men will also face two-year stadium bans for all Spanish soccer matches and have been ordered to pay court costs associated with the case. \u201cThis is the first conviction of its kind to be handed down in Spain, following a case brought before the courts by LaLiga, which was joined by the RFEF (Royal Spanish Football Federation), Real Madrid and, in recent weeks, the victim himself, Vin\u00edcius Jr.,\u201d La Liga said in a statement. In a post on social media, Brazilian superstar Vin\u00edcius Jr. said: \u201cMany asked me to ignore it, many others said that my fight was in vain and that I should just \u2018play football.\u2019 But as I\u2019ve always said I\u2019m not a victim of racism. I am a tormentor of racists. This first criminal conviction in the history of Spain is not for me. It\u2019s for all Black people. \u201cMay other racists be afraid, ashamed and hide in the shadows. Otherwise, I\u2019ll be here to get you. Thank you to La Liga and Real Madrid for helping with this historic conviction.\u201d The original sentences of 12-month prison terms and three-year stadium bans were reduced because the men accepted criminal responsibility for their actions and expressed regret, including writing a letter of apology to Vin\u00edcius, Real Madrid and La Liga. \u201cThe three defendants acknowledged their criminal liability and have released an apology letter addressed to our player Vin\u00edcius Jr., to Real Madrid C.F. and to everyone else who felt offended and degraded by their behavior,\u201d Real Madrid said in a statement. \u201cAs well as showing their remorse, the three defendants asked in their letter to fans that all forms of racism and intolerance be eradicated in competitions.\u201d Lawyers representing the defendants asked that the prison sentences be suspended, and prosecutors did not object to the request. Suspended sentences are common in Spain for prison terms less than two years for first-time convictions on non-violent crimes. The judge in the case will rule on that request at a later date. \u201cThis ruling is great news regarding the fight against racism in Spain, as it redresses the wrong suffered by Vin\u00edcius Jr. and sends a clear message to those people who go to a football stadium to hurl abuse,\u201d La Liga President Javier Tebas said in a statement. \u201cLa Liga will identify them, report them and there will be criminal consequences for them.\u201d Global soccer\u2019s governing body FIFA also praised the news. \u201cI am pleased to see the firm action and sentencing taken by the Spanish authorities in relation to the racist abuse directed at Vin\u00edcius Jr in a Spanish La Liga match in May 2023. This is a positive step,\u201d FIFA President Gianni Infantino said in a statement. Infantino continued: \u201cWe can no longer accept what is happening in stadiums and on the pitch. Our message to people anywhere in the world who still behave in a racist way when they are dealing with football is clear: we don\u2019t want you. \u201cThese people have to be excluded, they are not part of our community and not part of football.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/sport/vinicius-spanish-court-prison-soccer-racist-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "world"}}

There were four women on the longer list and none was approved. The slate includes hardline parliament speaker and former Revolutionary Guards commander Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf and Saeed Jalili, ex-chief nuclear negotiator and former head of the Supreme National Security Council, Iran\u2019s top security body. Competition is expected to be fierce between Qalibaf and Jalili, both of whom backed Raisi in the 2021 presidential election. \u201c(Qalibaf) and Jalili are on competing conservative poles and are unlikely to withdraw in favor of the other,\u201d wrote Sina Toossi, a DC-based Iran analyst and senior fellow at the Center for International Policy, in a post on X. The list also includes Amir Hossein Ghazizadeh Hashemi, Alireza Zakani, and Mostafa Pour Mohammad, all of whom are also hardliners. The Guardian Council has, however, also approved Masoud Pezeshkian, a reformist lawmaker who served as parliament deputy speaker from 2016 to 2020. Pezeshkian is expected to have a slim chance in the race. On Sunday, reformist newspaper Shargh Daily posted a photo of the six candidates with the caption, \u201cOne against five.\u201d During the Mahsa Amini protests in September 2022, Pezeshkian said in an interview, \u201cIt is our fault. We want to implement religious faith through the use of force.

Both men were also previously disbarred by the Guardian Council. Raisi\u2019s death and the nearing vote come at a delicate time for a country facing unprecedented challenges at home and from abroad.

{"id": "2024_06_08_middleeast_four-israeli-hostages-freed-gaza-intl", "text": "The Israeli military rescued four hostages in a special operation in the Nuseirat refugee camp, central Gaza, that Gazan authorities said killed 236 people and injured more than 400 others. Noa Argamani, Almog Meir Jan, Andrey Kozlov, and Shlomi Ziv, were rescued by the Israeli military, intelligence and special forces from two separate locations in Nuseirat, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Saturday. All four were kidnapped from the Nova music festival on October 7. \u201cThey are in good medical condition and have been transferred to the \u2018Sheba\u2019 Tel-HaShomer Medical Center for further medical examinations,\u201d the IDF added. An\u00a0Israeli\u00a0policeman from a special\u00a0counter-terrorism\u00a0unit was killed in Saturday\u2019s rescue operation, according to\u00a0Israeli\u00a0police. News of the rescue came soon after Israel\u2019s military said it was operating in Nuseirat and other areas of central Gaza, where heavy shelling and artillery fire was reported. At least 236 people have been killed as a result of the rescue operation and more than 400 injured, hospital officials in Gaza said Saturday. The killed and wounded were taken to two hospitals in Gaza, Al-Awda Hospital in Nuseirat and Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir Al-Balah. Al-Awda Hospital director Dr Marwan Abu Nasser told CNN that 142 bodies had been counted at the medical facility by late Saturday, while Al-Aqsa Hospital in Deir al-Balah said 94 bodies had been counted. CNN has no way of verifying casualty numbers reported by Palestinian officials in Gaza. Medical records in the war-torn enclave do not differentiate between civilians and militants killed. An Israeli military spokesperson put the number of casualties from the operation at \u201cunder 100,\u201d and had no information on how many of those were civilians. Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said Israeli forces had to enter civilian areas to reach hostages as this was where Hamas had embedded itself. He said the hostages had been locked in two separate apartments in civilian multi-story buildings about 200 meters (650 feet) apart, with Argamani held in a different building to the three males. He said the IDF had received intelligence on their location beforehand, noting that hostages in Gaza were frequently moved around and Argamani had previously been held elsewhere. Similar raids had been called off at the last minute \u201cmore than three or four times\u201d due to unfavorable conditions, he added. The first phase of Saturday\u2019s operation saw the IDF target militant infrastructure with pre-planned strikes, Hagari said. For the rescue, the IDF had opted for a daytime operation because of the element of surprise, he added, and it had prepared by building models of the apartments the hostages were held in. Hagari said that the IDF had come under intense fire, especially after withdrawing from the apartments, but did not provide evidence for his claims. Saturday was an \u201cemotional and happy day for the state of Israel and the IDF,\u201d Hagari said, though he cautioned that most of the remaining hostages were not being held in conditions that would allow for similar operations. Following Saturday\u2019s announcement, the total number of hostages still held in the Gaza Strip from October 7 is now 116, of which at least 41 are dead. \u2018It is hell on earth\u2019 On the ground in Gaza, locals described scenes of carnage following the strikes that led up to the rescue. Nidal Abdo, was shopping in Nuseirat on Saturday when he described a \u201ccrazy bombardment\u201d hitting. \u201c[It was] something we never witnessed before, maybe 150 rockets fell in less than 10 minutes, while we were running away more fell on the market,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are children torn apart and scattered in the streets, they wiped out Nuseirat, it is hell on earth,\u201d he said. Another local, Abu Abdallah, said the strike hit while people were sleeping, adding: \u201cDogs were eating people\u2019s remains. We pulled out six martyrs, all torn up children and women, we risked our lives to get them to the hospital.\u201d Footage from Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital shows trucks and ambulances transferring injured people and bodies to the hospital. Inside the hospital, people can be seen waiting on the  floor. Graphic video shows many Palestinians, including children, injured with blood on their faces and clothes. Footage from the hospital also shows people screaming and crying, huddled over bodies covered in blankets. Hamas described the operation as a \u201cbrutal crime, devoid of the values of civilization and humanity,\u201d saying the Israeli military \u201ccommitted a horrific massacre against innocent civilians.\u201d Hamas said the rescue would not change Israel\u2019s \u201cstrategic failure in the Gaza Strip,\u201d as the group still holds a large number of other hostages after eight months of fighting. The group\u2019s leader Ismail Haniyeh said, \u201cOur people will not surrender, and the resistance will continue to defend our rights in the face of this criminal enemy.\u201d Abu Obaida, the spokesman for the group\u2019s armed wing, the Al-Qassam Brigades, also claimed some hostages had been killed during the rescue mission, but provided no proof and did not elaborate on the identities of who had purportedly died. In a post on Telegram, he said the rescue raid \u201cposed a great danger\u201d to the remaining hostages and \u201cwill have a devastating impact on their conditions and lives.\u201d Asked about the claim, the Israel Defense Forces said, \u201cHamas is a terrorist organization that uses psychological terrorism in order to achieve its goals, accordingly its statements should be taken with limited credibility.\u201d Hostage rescues are rare: this is only the third such successful operation. IDF Corporal Ori Megidish was rescued in October last year from the northern Gaza Strip. In another operation on February 12 this year, Fernando Marman and Louis Har were rescued from southern Rafah. A symbol of October 7 One of the rescued group, 25-year-old Noa Argamani, became one of the symbols of the October 7 attacks, after video emerged of her shouting and pleading from the seat of a motorbike as a group of Hamas fighters drives away with her in tow. In the video, Argamani\u2019s boyfriend, fellow Israeli citizen Avinatan Or, is also led away by Hamas fighters. Noa\u2019s mother Liora Argamani is a Chinese citizen who has been grappling with late stage brain cancer. In a video released last November, she made a desperate plea to be able to see her daughter one more time. \u201cI don\u2019t know how long I have left. I wish for the chance to see my Noa at home,\u201d her mother said, calling on US President Joe Biden to push for her daughter\u2019s release. A spokesperson for Ichilov Hospital in Tel Aviv confirmed on Saturday that Argamani had been transferred there so that she could be treated alongside her mother. Argamani\u2019s family had previously received signs that she was still alive. She appeared in a series of Hamas propaganda videos released in January this year. Video showed Argamani embracing her father after her release. She also held a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who told her \u201cwe didn\u2019t give up on you for a moment.\u201d Of the others freed: \u2013 Almog Meir Jan, 22, is from the small city of Or Yehuda, outside Tel Aviv. He was due to start a new job at a technology company on October 8. \u2013 Shlomi Ziv, 41, was working as a security guard at the Nova festival when he was kidnapped on October 7. Ziv had been living in the local moshav or agricultural settlement for 17 years with his wife Miren. \u2013 Andrey Kozlov, 27, is a Russian citizen who move to Israel a year ago. He was also working as a security guard at the Nova festival. \u2018We can\u2019t forget\u2019 the others Relatives of the rescued hostages said they felt happy and blessed to be reunited with their loved ones but also called on the Israeli government to bring back the remaining captives. \u201cI couldn\u2019t stop hugging him,\u201d Orit Meir, mother of Almog Meir Jan, told a news conference Saturday. \u201cTomorrow is my birthday so I got my present.\u201d Meir thanked the Israeli military and government for the rescue, but also urged the government to secure the release of the dozens of captives that remained in Gaza. \u201cWe want a deal now. We want them to come back home as soon as possible,\u201d she said. Jennifer Master, the girlfriend of Andrey Kozlov, echoed those sentiments, saying, \u201cThank you for saving our loved ones. And we wish that all the loved ones will come back home safe and sound and there will be a deal soon.\u201d Yaakov Argamani, father of Noa Argamani, added: \u201cWe can\u2019t forget there are 120 hostages. We must do everything, but everything, as soon as possible to bring them home, so that their families can embrace them in happiness.\u201d Rozi Ziv, mother of Shlomi Ziv, said, \u201cMy dream came true. I wish for the other hostages that their dreams will come true, too.\u201d Meanwhile, following news of the rescue, thousands of demonstrators gathered across Israel, calling on the government to secure a deal to free the remaining hostages. In Tel Aviv, demonstrators gathered at a plaza informally known as Hostages Square, many  holding up pictures of the hostages with signs that read, \u201cBring them home now.\u201d Earlier, the crowd cheered the Israeli military for its rescue operation. Many are calling for new elections, calling for Netanyahu\u2019s government to step down.

{"id": "2024_06_10_europe_wwii-vet-marries-intl-scli", "text": "Together, the collective age of the bride and groom was nearly 200. But World War II\u00a0veteran Harold Terens\u00a0and his sweetheart Jeanne Swerlin proved that love is eternal as they tied the knot Saturday inland of the D-Day beaches in Normandy, France. Their respective ages \u2014 he\u2019s 100, she\u2019s a youngster of just 96 \u2014 made their nuptials an almost double-century celebration. Terens called it \u2033the best day of my life.\u2033 On her way\u00a0into the nuptials, the bubbly bride-to-be said: \u201cIt\u2019s not just for young people, love, you know? We get butterflies. And we get a little action, also.\u2033 The location was the elegant stone-worked town hall of Carentan, a key initial D-Day objective that saw ferocious fighting after the June 6, 1944, Allied landings that helped\u00a0rid Europe of Adolf Hitler\u2019s tyranny. Like other towns and villages across the Normandy coast where nearly 160,000 Allied troops came ashore under fire on five code-named beaches, it was an effervescent hub of remembrance and\u00a0celebration on the 80th anniversary\u00a0of the deeds and sacrifices of young men and women that day, festooned with flags and bunting and with veterans feted like rockstars. As the swing of Glenn Miller and other period tunes rang out on the streets, well-wishers \u2013 some in WWII-period clothes \u2013 were already lined up a good hour before the wedding, behind barriers outside the town hall, with a rousing pipe and drum band also on hand to serenade the happy couple. After both declaring \u201coui\u201d to vows read by Carentan\u2019s mayor in English, the couple exchanged rings. \u201cWith this ring, I thee wed,\u201d Terens said. She giggled and gasped, \u201cReally?\u201d With champagne flutes in hand, they waved through an open window to the crowds outside. \u201cTo everybody\u2019s good health. And to peace in the world and the preservation of democracy all over the world and the end of the war in Ukraine and Gaza,\u201d Terens said as he and his bride then clinked glasses and drank. The crowd yelled \u201cla mari\u00e9e!\u201d - the bride! \u2013 to Swerlin, who wore a long, flowing dress of vibrant pink. Terens looked dapper in a light-blue suit and pink kerchief in his breast pocket. And they enjoyed a very special wedding-night party: They were invited to the state dinner at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace on Saturday night with\u00a0President Emmanuel Macron and US President Joe Biden. \u201cCongratulations to the newlyweds,\u201d Macron said, prompting cheers and a standing ovation from other guests during the toast praising French-American friendship. \u201c(The town of) Carentan was happy to host your wedding, and us, your wedding dinner,\u201d he told the couple. The wedding was symbolic, not binding in law. Mayor Jean-Pierre Lhonneur\u2019s office said he wasn\u2019t empowered to wed foreigners who aren\u2019t residents of Carentan, and that the couple, who are both American, hadn\u2019t requested legally binding vows.However, they could always complete those formalities back in Florida if they wished. Lhonneur likes to say that Normandy is practically the 51st state of the US, given its reverence and gratitude for Allied soldiers and the sacrifices of tens of thousands who never made it home from the Battle of Normandy. \u201cLove is eternal, yes, maybe,\u201d the mayor said, referring to the newlyweds, although his comments also fittingly describe the feelings of many Normans for veterans. \u201cI hope for them the best happiness together.\u201d Dressed in a 1940s dress that belonged to her mother, Louise, and a red beret, 73-year-old Jane Ollier was among spectators who waited for a glimpse of the lovebirds. The couple, both widowed, grew up in New York City: she in Brooklyn, he in the Bronx. \u201cIt\u2019s so touching to get married at that age,\u2019\u2019 Ollier said. \u201cIf it can bring them happiness in the last years of their lives, that\u2019s fantastic.\u201d The WWII veteran first visited France as a 20-year-old US Army Air Forces corporal shortly after D-Day. Terens enlisted in 1942 and, after shipping to Britain, was attached to a four-pilot P-47 Thunderbolt fighter unit as their radio repair technician. On D-Day, Terens helped repair planes returning from France so they could rejoin the battle. He said half his company\u2019s pilots died that day. Terens himself went to France 12 days later, helping transport freshly captured Germans and just-freed American POWs to England. Following the Nazi surrender in May 1945, Terens again helped transport freed Allied prisoners to England before he shipped back to the US a month later. Swerlin made it abundantly clear that her new centenarian husband doesn\u2019t lack for\u00a0rizz. \u201cHe\u2019s the greatest kisser ever, you know?\u201d she proudly declared before they embraced enthusiastically for TV cameras. \u201cAll right! That\u2019s it for now !\u201d Terens said as he came up for air. To which she quipped: \u201cYou mean there\u2019s more later?\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/europe/wwii-vet-marries-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "world"}}

The Malawi Defense Force Aircraft carrying Chilima and others left the capital of Lilongwe at 9:17 a.m. local time (3.17 a.m. ET), the presidential office and cabinet said in a statement. The plane had been scheduled to land at the Mzuzu International Airport, about 380 km (240 miles) to the north of Lilongwe, but did not arrive and is no longer detectable by radar, according to authorities. \u201cAll efforts by aviation authorities to make contact with the aircraft since it went off the radar have failed thus far,\u201d the presidential statement read. \u201cAs such, the commander of the Malawi Defense Force, General Valentino Phiri, has since informed His Excellency Dr. Lazarus McCarthy Chakwera of the incident, and the president has since canceled his scheduled departure for the Bahamas and ordered all regional and national agencies to conduct an immediate search and rescue operation to locate the whereabouts of the aircraft,\u201d the statement added. In an address Monday night, President Chakwera said air traffic control in Mzuzu had advised the aircraft not to attempt a landing due to \u201cpoor visibility\u201d and bad weather, and to return to the capital Lilongwe. Soon after, authorities lost contact with the aircraft, prompting a search and rescue operation, Chakwera said during the live broadcast on state TV channel MBC. Signals from telecommunications towers reported the plane\u2019s last known position to a 10-kilometre (6-mile) radius in a forest reserve, which has since become the area of focus for the search and rescue operation, Chakwera said. Search and rescue operations \u201cwill continue until the plane is found,\u201d he added. \u201cI know this is a heartbreaking situation. I know we are all frightened and concerned. I too am concerned,\u201d Chakwera said. \u201cBut I want to assure you that I am sparing no available resource to find that plane. And I am holding on to every fiber of hope that we will find survivors.\u201d He said Malawi had contacted neighboring countries and the United States, Britain, Norway and the Israeli governments for support in the rescue efforts. The US has offered a military C-12 aircraft to assist in the search, according to a statement from the US embassy in Malawi. \u201cThe U.S. Embassy Lilongwe is deeply concerned by the news that the plane carrying Vice President Saulos Klaus Chilima and nine others went missing yesterday morning,\u201d the statement posted Tuesday on X said. \u201cWe join President Chakwera in his prayers for the well-being of all those on board the Vice President\u2019s plane,\u201d the statement added.

{"id": "2024_06_10_china_northern-china-heat-wave-intl-hnk", "text": "A major heat wave is forecast to spread across large swathes of northern China this week, bringing record high temperatures to some areas, according to China\u2019s meteorological authorities. The heat wave, which began on Saturday, has already triggered government weather alerts and follows the country\u2019s hottest spring on record. The national observatory on Monday issued an orange alert for high temperatures \u2013 the second most severe warning \u2013 as sweltering heat engulfed the country\u2019s north. On Sunday, in the coastal province of Shandong, seven national meteorological stations recorded the highest temperature for early June, while temperatures in northern Hebei province and the western region of Xinjiang soared above 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit), according to the National Meteorological Center (NMC). The heat wave is forecast to further expand in scope in the coming days, the NMC said in a statement. Local governments have also issued\u00a0warnings. Beijing on Saturday raised its first yellow alert for high temperatures this summer, warning residents to avoid going outdoors during the hottest parts of the day. The alert came as tens of thousands of high school graduates in the Chinese capital were finishing their national college entrance exam \u2013 a two-day, highly competitive test known as the \u201cgaokao.\u201d A school in Beijing\u2019s Chaoyang district handed out free ice cream to parents waiting outside the gate in the grueling heat, state media reported. Zheng Zhihai, chief forecaster at the National Climate Center, told the state-run Global Times that temperatures in most parts of China were expected to be higher than usual this summer, and the number of high-temperature days would also be greater than usual. Zhong said the high temperatures were linked to El Ni\u00f1o, a natural climate pattern marked by warmer than average ocean temperatures in the equatorial Pacific. China saw its hottest spring on record this year. The national average temperature between March and May reached 12.3 degrees Celsius, the highest since records began in 1961, with 12 national meteorological stations registering temperatures reaching or surpassing records, according to the National Climate Center. Meanwhile, parts of southern China have been grappling with weeks of downpours. In Guangdong province, record\u00a0rainfall unleashed deadly floods in April, with one tribunal of the Pearl River experiencing the earliest arrival of its annual flood season since records began in 1998. China also saw its hottest year on record in 2023, as the world\u2019s biggest polluter confronted a series of relentless heat waves and other extreme weather events driven by the human-caused climate crisis. The average temperature in China last year stood at 10.7 degrees Celsius \u2013 the highest since records began in 1961, according to the National Climate Center, state-run news agency Xinhua reported. It broke the previous record of 10.5 degrees set in 2021. China\u2019s exceptional warmth echoed global trends \u2013 with scientists confirming that 2023 was officially the hottest year on record, the result of the combined effects of\u00a0El Ni\u00f1o\u00a0and climate change.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/china/northern-china-heat-wave-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_08_tech_hong-kong-uber-taxis-intl-hnk", "text": "They hire their Uber through the app just like any other passenger, and hop in the back of the car. But halfway through the ride, the mood changes and they reveal their identity. \u201cPull over here. It\u2019s you. You are in trouble for driving an Uber,\u201d the passenger tells his driver, during one of a few recent encounters captured in video and circulated online in Hong Kong. The passengers aren\u2019t traffic cops. They are vigilante taxi drivers taking direct action, having become increasingly frustrated about Hong Kong authorities\u2019 failure to regulate the ride-hailing platform. After the car pulls over, they hand over the driver, often still reeling in shock, to the police officers they have called. \u201cYou may say this is provocative. But without these videos, people may think we inflate the numbers of \u2018white-plate vehicles\u2019 out there,\u201d one of the taxi drivers who took part in a sting operation, and asked to be only identified as Ka Chun, told CNN. \u201cWhite-plate vehicles\u201d is how taxi drivers colloquially refer to Uber. \u201cWe just want the government to enforce the law.\u201d Uber (UBER) remains technically illegal in Hong Kong, which it entered in 2014. But it has thrived under the ambiguous approach of officials keen to project an image of technological modernity. \u201cUber is often framed as innovation, which seems to contribute to the \u2018smart city\u2019 vision \u2013 something that the Hong Kong government has strived to be,\u201d said Oliver Chan, an assistant communications studies professor who specializes in the gig economy at Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK). Ads for the US-headquartered company are widespread, and its drivers are highly unlikely to face problems with the authorities. Taxi drivers have for years complained about how Uber has flouted local laws, upended the market, and chipped away their already modest earnings. But their recent acts of vigilantism appear to have backfired. Instead of rallying public support, the cabbies were on the receiving end of a backlash, with passengers taking to social media to share their bad experiences of rude taxi drivers, ride rejections and opportunistic charging during heavy rains and the city\u2019s regular summer typhoons. \u201cThey charge arbitrarily and refuse to take passengers. And yet, they have the audacity to go on sting operations,\u201d one person wrote on LIHKG, a popular local internet forum, adding: \u201cShameless people know no bounds.\u201d Others have retaliated by reporting law-breaking taxi drivers to police. Pictures of taxis parking in restricted areas flooded the internet in posts calling for people to report them. WhatsApp groups set up by Uber drivers also discuss how to retaliate, one driver told CNN. So tense is the backlash that Hong Kong leader John Lee, when asked about the furor by reporters last week, acknowledged the \u201cfierce public debate\u201d and appealed for calm. He urged taxi drivers to stay away from any vigilante acts. As with New York\u2019s amber-painted medallion taxis and London\u2019s black hackney cabs, Hong Kong\u2019s 15,000 red urban taxis are emblematic of the city. But they are not exactly known for their friendliness or reliable service. Passenger Lau Chi-tim recalled being charged double during a typhoon a few years ago. Drivers often charge a little more because their insurance does not cover extreme weather conditions. But Lau said: \u201cThe trip lasted only 15 minutes and most of the journey was inside a tunnel anyway. Where is the risk?\u201d Another passenger lamented how selective taxi drivers can be. \u201cPeople with pets, a pram, wanting to cross the harbor, or going anywhere that may be crowded\u2026 they just reject you,\u201d Jason Chan said. Similar complaints abound, despite refusal to take passengers being an offense under the Hong Kong law. Those who prefer Uber see it as an alternative to the poor service they have long tolerated and would rather pay a little more for a smoother ride. An Uber driver, who gave only his name Mo for fear of being identified by authorities, said passengers told him they preferred Uber drivers\u2019 manners, and quality of driving. \u201cWe don\u2019t dare swerve around on the road because it\u2019s our own vehicle,\u201d he said. But for Ka Chun, the driver who went undercover, it\u2019s about defending their interest and an institution that he and his fellow cabbies invested time and money to be part of. \u201cThey have an impact on us because these white-plate vehicles can take passengers without a taxi license,\u201d he said, speaking of a permit that can cost a fortune in the city where properties, and even parking spaces, are traded as speculative commodities. Hong Kong\u2019s transport authority has issued some 18,000 taxi licenses \u2013 including for non-urban blue and green cabs - and they are currently traded for up to $400,000 (HK$3.2 million) in a free market. Annual insurance for a taxi also costs up to 10 times that for private vehicles. Drivers who don\u2019t own a taxi pay rental of 550 Hong Kong dollars (about $70) for a 12-hour shift, almost a third of what they make on an average day, according to Ka Chun. \u201cUber drivers don\u2019t need any capital whatsoever as they are using their own car to take passengers,\u201d he said. Patrick Tam, secretary general of the Hong Kong Taxi & Public Light Bus Association, acknowledged the complaints against some unruly taxi drivers, and said he supported the police going after them. \u201cThese taxi drivers should face tough punishment. But it doesn\u2019t make vehicles operating without a proper license less of a problem,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just want fair treatment.\u201d So far, Hong Kong police have said they had not arrested any Uber drivers ensnared in the amateur sting operations. Estyn Chung, general manager of Uber in Hong Kong, noted that the company launched its Uber Taxi service in 2020 to give riders the option to get a taxi on its app. \u201cWe know from elsewhere around the world that taxi and ride-sharing services can thrive alongside each other. Hong Kong is not an exception,\u201d he said. Creating harmony between traditional cabbies and gig-economy drivers can be tricky. And CUHK\u2019s Chan said that, after years of ambiguity, Hong Kong is already playing catch-up. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to say the extent to which the government wants to promote Uber, and more broadly, ride-hailing platforms at this point,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Hong Kong\u2019s ride-hailing regulations lag behind, for example, Singapore.\u201d The city government is expected to unveil a study on online ride-hailing services in July. A spokesman said it is \u201copen-minded\u201d on the apps, though \u201cthey must be in compliance with the relevant law and regulations.\u201d \u201cThe government should require them to get a different driver permit and insurance even if it legalizes their operation,\u201d said Ka Chun. \u201cOtherwise, why should I get a taxi license? I could drive white-plate vehicles.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/08/tech/hong-kong-uber-taxis-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_06_11_middleeast_hamas-responds-hostage-deal-intl-latam", "text": "Talks to bring about a ceasefire and hostage deal that could stop the war in Gaza were thrown into doubt Tuesday evening when Israel characterized a Hamas response to the latest proposal as a rejection,\u00a0precipitating a blame game between the two sides. Hamas had submitted its response to Qatari mediators, proposing amendments to the Israeli proposal, including a timeline for a permanent ceasefire and complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, a source with knowledge of the talks told CNN earlier on Tuesday. Talks are expected continue via the Qatari and Egyptian mediators in coordination with the United States to see if an agreement can be reached, the source added. After submitting its response Tuesday,\u00a0Hamas spokesman and political bureau member Osama Hamdan\u00a0told Lebanon-based TV Al Mayadeen, the group was committed to achieving a ceasefire. \u201cOur response is a clear reaffirmation of our commitment to the ceasefire and withdrawal from Gaza, a commitment we have consistently upheld,\u201d Hamdan\u00a0added. But in a potential sign of how Israel views the proposed amendments, one Israeli official speaking to CNN analyst Barak Ravid described Hamas\u2019 response to the original deal as a rejection. \u201cIsrael received Hamas\u2019 response. Hamas rejected the proposal for a hostage deal, which was laid out by President Biden in his speech,\u201d the source said according to Ravid\u2019s post on X. Hamas leadership quickly pushed back on the claim as an attempt to back out of the proposal. \u201cThe response of Hamas and the Palestinian factions to the truce proposal was responsible, serious and positive. The response is consistent with the demands of our people and the resistance and opens the way to reaching an agreement,\u201d said Izzat al-Rishq, a member of the Hamas political bureau, late on Tuesday. \u201cThe Israeli media\u2019s incitement to Hamas\u2019s response is an indication of attempts to evade the agreement\u2019s obligations.\u201d\u00a0 The tensions are surfacing at a sensitive moment. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken\u00a0is\u00a0currently on a\u00a0diplomatic swing through the region trying to secure agreement on\u00a0the\u00a0plan first unveiled by President Biden eleven days ago. The plan, drafted by Israel, has not been made public in full. Endorsed by the United Nations Security Council on Monday, the plan\u00a0envisages\u00a0a six-week ceasefire - during which Hamas would release hostages and Israel would release Palestinian prisoners \u2013 that would evolve into a permanent cessation of hostilities through negotiations. The White House has been at pains to stress it is an Israeli plan and have repeatedly said that Israel has accepted it, despite objections from Israel\u2019s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Mixed signals in Israel Earlier Tuesday, Israel had made its clearest signal yet that it was poised to formally sign up to the plan - though in the same short statement it suggested it intended to maintain the freedom to keep fighting. The short Israeli communication, attributed only to an Israeli government official, though widely understood to mean the Prime Minister\u2019s Office, started with an assertion of Israel\u2019s war aims before expressing support for the US-backed proposal currently on the table. \u201cIsrael will not end the war before achieving all its war objectives: destroying Hamas\u2019s military and governing capabilities, freeing all the hostages and ensuring Gaza doesn\u2019t pose a threat to Israel in the future,\u201d it said. \u201cThe proposal presented enables Israel to achieve these goals and Israel will indeed do so,\u201d the statement concluded. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s oft-repeated promise of total victory and the elimination of Hamas did not get a mention. The Israeli leader is caught between the voices of many in his country, who believe a ceasefire deal is the best way to secure the release of the 120 hostages still held by Hamas in Gaza, and those of his extreme right coalition partners who are adamant they want the war to continue. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Miniter Itamar Ben Gvir have both threatened to collapse the government if Netanyahu agrees to the deal in its current form. By contrast, senior opposition figures like one-time war cabinet member Benny Gantz, and opposition leader Yair Lapid have also been among those urging Netanyahu to embrace the US-backed plan. Hamas has also been under pressure to get on board with the US-backed proposal but said last week it is concerned Israel might not go through with the second phase of the plan \u2013 a permanent end to the fighting. \u201cUnless there is a clear position [from Israel] to prepare for a permanent ceasefire and a total withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, which is what could open the door wide to completing the agreement \u2026 we cannot come to an agreement,\u201d Hamas spokesman\u00a0and political bureau member\u00a0Osama Hamdan warned last week. This is a developing story and will be updated.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/middleeast/hamas-responds-hostage-deal-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_middleeast_australian-billionaire-gaza-aid-gate-system-intl", "text": "An Australian billionaire is offering to build a secure gate system on the Israel-Gaza border that he says could allow 10,000 metric tons of food aid to be delivered each day to starving Palestinians. Andrew Forrest, founder of the philanthropic Minderoo Foundation, was set to raise the proposal Tuesday at an emergency summit on Gaza in Jordan, co-hosted by that country, Egypt and the United Nations, and attended by\u00a0US Secretary of State Antony Blinken. He\u2019s also committed $5 million to improve the Jordanian humanitarian land corridor by building storage warehouses to allow more aid to pass\u00a0to Gaza. \u201cRight now, the Jordanian people are bearing a significant load by leading the single most effective route into Gaza. It is my intention to lighten their load,\u201d Forrest, a mining magnate\u00a0and avowed eco-warrior,\u00a0said in a statement. According to a video presentation on its website, Minderoo said the more ambitious plan, to build SafeGates at three points along the Israel-Gaza border, could be up and running in three weeks, if Israel gives the green light. In a separate statement, Forrest said the project had been devised in\u00a0consultation with Israel and Palestinian communities for the past two months. CNN has asked Israel for comment on the plan. The presentation added that the project has been developed by Fortescue, the iron ore mining and green energy company of which Forrest is the founder and executive chairman. SafeGates\u00a0involves installing three remotely monitored access points at undisclosed locations on the Israel-Gaza border to conduct 3D scans of trucks\u00a0delivering aid to the region as they arrive and depart. \u201cBeing located at crossing points into Gaza, the gates will be operated by a third party that will have remote monitoring capabilities over the facilities and scanning equipment and determine the\u00a0gates\u2019 operational hours,\u201d\u00a0Forrest said in the statement. \u201cThere is no cost to Israel and the plan respects red lines. On the Gazan side, we will work with the existing network of agencies, businesses, as well as Palestinian community groups for aid distribution within the Strip,\u201d he added. The deliveries would supplement other efforts to deliver aid to Palestinians who have been living under sustained bombardment by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) since Hamas militants launched a deadly attack on Israel last October. During that attack, Hamas-led\u00a0militants killed around 1,200 Israelis and took more than 250 hostages. After the\u00a0rescue of four hostages earlier this week,\u00a0around 116 are believed to still be in Gaza, alive or dead. Israel\u2019s efforts to eradicate Hamas have killed more than\u00a037,000 Palestinians since October 7, according to the Ministry of Health. The IDF has repeatedly said hundreds of trucks carrying humanitarian aid have been entering the Gaza Strip, but aid organizations say the supplies are not reaching civilians in need. How would it work? A video of the\u00a0SafeGates\u00a0system shows trucks driving at an automated entry gate, where they undergo a 3D scan to identify any security issues, before being allowed to enter a secure compound. Once in the holding area, the driver leaves via a door back to Israel, while another door opens on the Gaza side, allowing a driver from the Palestinian enclave to drive the truck out of the compound. According to the video, the truck would be scanned again on the Gaza side, and once cleared, the cabin would be detached from its trailer\u00a0for the unloading of the aid,\u00a0 before reattaching and returning to\u00a0Israel via the same process. The system would work to prevent unauthorized access to the vehicles, allaying fears that aid deliveries could present an opportunity for potential attackers to cross the border. The passage of aid into Gaza has become gridlocked by Israeli inspections, and in some cases the temporary closure of access points. The US has attempted to provide aid to Gaza via airdrops, and more recently by building a floating pier to allow the delivery of supplies from various countries by boat. However, a week after its started operation, the pier broke apart in rough seas, temporarily halting aid deliveries while damaged portions were towed to Israel for repairs.\u00a0It was\u00a0reconnected last Friday. Humanitarian crisis International condemnation of Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza is growing and on Monday\u00a0the United Nations Security Council\u00a0overwhelmingly approved a US-backed ceasefire plan. However, Israel vowed to continue its military operation in Gaza, saying it won\u2019t engage in \u201cmeaningless\u201d negotiations with Hamas. Meanwhile, mass hunger has created a secondary peril for Palestinians living\u00a0within\u00a0the besieged strip. In a recent\u00a0report, the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET), said it was \u201cpossible, if not likely\u201d that the threshold for a famine had been passed in northern Gaza in April. The thresholds to confirm a famine are an extreme lack of food in households, acute malnutrition and mortality. FEWS NET, funded by the US Agency for International Development, is a leading provider of early warning and analysis on acute food insecurity around the world. It said it wasn\u2019t possible to confirm a famine in the north because it was too dangerous to deploy people there to gather data, but it warned that conditions will worsen if more aid is not delivered soon. \u201cIt is possible\u00a0famine will persist through at least July if there is not a fundamental change in how food assistance is distributed and accessed after entering Gaza,\u201d the report warned.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/middleeast/australian-billionaire-gaza-aid-gate-system-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "travel_chinese-food-evolution-french-polynesia", "text": "It\u2019s a cloudless morning and the sun is shining brightly off the coast of French Polynesia\u2019s capital and largest city, Papeete, enhancing the water\u2019s already vibrant shades of blue. Though just meters away from the territory\u2019s largest commercial port, cruise ship terminal and airport, the water is clean and clear, amplified by the presence of kaleidoscopic coral and a diverse array of marine creatures. My spearfishing guide is scouring the coral reefs for anything that might make for a delicious meal, but I\u2019m hoping we catch some tuna, mackerel or parrotfish to make\u00a0poisson cru \u00e0 la chinoise,\u00a0a Chinese take on French Polynesia\u2019s national dish, poisson cru au lait de coco\u00a0(lime-marinated raw fish with coconut milk). Both versions of the national dish are as ubiquitous as they are delicious, but the popularity of the chinoise version poses an interesting question: How did Chinese food become one of this French territory\u2019s favorite cuisines? Forging new lives, thousands of miles from home According to historical accounts, the first group of Chinese immigrants, primarily of the Hakka and Punti ethnicities, arrived in French Polynesia in 1865. The majority were brought from China\u2019s Guangdong province to work on a cotton plantation in Atimaono, located on the south side of French Polynesia\u2019s main island, Tahiti. But in 1873, the owner of the plantation died; just one year later, his cotton company went bankrupt. Being more than 11,000 kilometers from home and having little money, many of those Chinese workers remained in French Polynesia to forge new lives. Some continued farming on the defunct plantation, others opened small shops and eateries throughout the archipelago. From these humble beginnings, the Chinese population has grown to become an integral part of French Polynesa\u2019s business sector. Chinese is now the country\u2019s second-largest ethnic group, accounting for more than 10% of the overseas territory\u2019s population. Early on, Chinese cooks had to adapt to what was available in French Polynesia, utilizing more fresh seafood, fruits like coconut and breadfruit, and staples like taro instead of rice. Soy and oyster sauces, along with other ingredients needed for more complex Chinese cooking, would become more readily available only with later waves of immigration from China in the early to mid-1900s, says an article in the Journal of Pacific History. This relatively slow pace of culinary evolution would also give local Tahitians\u2019 palates more time to become accustomed to more flavorful food; before the Chinese arrived, Tahitian cuisine was very simple and predominantly seasoned with just a few ingredients, such as salt, pepper, lime, onions and coconut milk. It\u2019s hard to picture exactly what early Tahitian-Chinese food may have looked like or tasted like, especially with\u00a0the prevalence of Chinese ingredients on grocery store shelves today. Thankfully, one relic of early Chinese-Tahitian cooking has stood the test of time. Ma\u2019a Tinito, literally meaning \u201cChinese food\u201d in the Tahitian language, is also the name of a dish that\u2019s considered one of the region\u2019s earliest Chinese culinary creations. According to research by the Sinitong Association, which oversees the local Chinese cultural associations of French Polynesia, it was invented by a Chinese kitchen assistant in the tiny district of Atimaono. The story goes that the cook, short on ingredients, had to improvise to quickly satiate the hungry stomachs of the area\u2019s plantation workers. In his storeroom, he found red beans and salted pork, and then to add a bit of color to the dish, he fetched some bok choy (Chinese cabbage) and long beans from the vegetable garden. Curious locals asked the workers, \u201cWhat are you eating?\u201d The workers replied: \u201cMa\u2019a Tinito!\u201d (Chinese food!) Easy to cook, cheap, delicious and easily adaptable, the dish, and its name, were here to stay. An extra dose of sweetness A surefire way to immerse yourself not only in the flavors, but also in the culture of Chinese-Tahitian cuisine, is to sign up for a food tour. \u201cOur Chinese food is about family and friends,\u201d says Orama Mollimard, founder of the local food tour and travel company Tahiti With Me. \u201cIt\u2019s something that is meant to be shared and appreciated with everyone at the table.\u201d Having had almost two years of experience as a food tour guide, Orama decided to found her own company in 2024, so that she could share her favorite eats with new friends from around the world. Her Papeete food tour highlights Chinese-Tahitian snacks as an ode to her own Chinese-Tahitian heritage. Hungry foodies can look forward to a few of Orama\u2019s personal favorites, such as steamed chicken rice balls, Chinese-style fish beignets and plum-powdered mangoes. When trying one of Orama\u2019s recommended versions of\u00a0poisson cru \u00e0 la chinoise, those familiar with how raw fish is served in China might draw some connections between the two. Y\u00fash\u0113ng, meaning \u201craw fish\u201d in Chinese, is a popular yet relatively simple dish that generally consists of raw fish slices and an accompanying savory, sour and sometimes spicy sauce. This delicacy has been eaten for thousands of years in China, and has been brought by the Chinese diasporas to all parts of the globe. One can easily imagine Chinese immigrants in the late 1800s or early 1900s experimenting with different combinations of flavors and fish, eventually leading them to create a sweet, sour and savory Chinese-inspired version of\u00a0poisson cru. Tuna, julienned carrots and turnips, cucumber, onions, garlic and ginger, mixed with a beautiful dressing of lemon or lime juice, sugar, salt, pepper, sunflower oil and rice vinegar \u2013 a simple yet delicious manifestation of Chinese-Tahitian fusion that pays heed and compliment to the national dish. While not all poisson cru \u00e0 la chinoise recipes require the addition of sugar, French Polynesia\u2019s collective sweet tooth deems it unthinkable to exclude it. \u201cOur cooks make the dishes slightly sweeter than they would be normally to appeal to local tastes,\u201d says Karl Chung-Tan, second-generation owner of the Restaurant Golden Lake on the island of Mo\u2019orea. This extends to other dishes. For example, the classic Cantonese roast suckling pig is given a unique twist here: instead of being served with a yellow mustard dipping sauce as it is in Hong Kong or Guangzhou, it\u2019s paired with a side of lush and velvety coconut milk. Dishes like these make it clear French Polynesia\u2019s chefs aren\u2019t attempting to simply mirror their counterparts in China. By embracing local ingredients and tastes, as well as traditional Chinese techniques and flavors, they are able to create an even more uniquely delicious and innovative synthesis. Globalization has made accessing once hard-to-find ingredients relatively easy, and while authenticity has its charm, the evolution of Chinese-Tahitian fusion in French Polynesia makes for a rare and exciting culinary story. Ready to experience it first-hand? Below is a selection of restaurants throughout French Polynesia serving excellent Chinese-Tahitian food, along with recommended dishes to try. Tahiti Restaurant Le Dahlia (Arue) It was only appropriate that Restaurant Le Dahlia was my first introduction to Chinese-Tahitian cuisine. Opened in 1972, it\u2019s the oldest continuously operating Chinese restaurant in Tahiti. Their suckling pig with coconut milk is truly outstanding. Their steamed black bean parrotfish is said to be a must-try, but diners need to call a few days in advance to order it. Chez Mei (Papeete) I\u2019m not sure how many times one must eat\u00a0poisson cru\u00a0to be considered a connoisseur - but of the seven or eight times I enjoyed the dish throughout my recent trip, Chez Mei\u2019s\u00a0version\u00a0stood head and shoulders above the rest. Papeete Sunday Market The Papeete Sunday Market is the beating heart of French Polynesia\u2019s capital city. All kinds of goodies are available for purchase: wild-caught whole tunas, locally grown fruit and vegetables, freshly baked pain au chocolates and croissants,\u00a0poisson cru\u00a0by the pound, and even pearls and other souvenirs. Yet where the market really shines is its incredible array of Chinese dim sum (snack) offerings. While all these recommended dim sum dishes are of Chinese origin, some might be best known by a name in one of four languages: Tahitian, French, Hakka or Cantonese. As such, the corresponding local name for each item is listed. Embrace your inner polyglot and get snacking! \u2013 Chao pao (steamed stuffed buns)\u2013 Nems (spring rolls)\u2013 Bouchons/Siu Mai (steamed dumplings with pork, shrimp or chicken)\u2013 Samoussas (fried wontons)\u2013 Lopepan (white glutinous rice dumplings, filled with turnip, chicken and pepper)\u2013 Founpan (red glutinous rice dumplings, filled with brown sugar and crushed peanuts) The market opens at about 4 a.m. and tourists are advised to get there early. When I arrived at 4:15 a.m. it was already humming with activity; there was a line 20-30 people deep to grab a few slices of one vendor\u2019s famous Pua\u2019a Roti (Cantonese-style barbecue roast pork). Mo\u2019orea Restaurant Golden Lake (Temae) While not on the regular menu at Golden Lake, insiders can ask for a family-style portion of Ma\u2019a Tinito to be cooked to order. The mainstays of the dish are its thick, sweet and salty brown sauce and large chunks of tender pork, yet almost every other element is fungible; it\u2019s the perfect dish to cook at home when you\u2019re in a pinch. Versions of the dish vary as widely today as they probably did in the 1800s, as beans, macaroni, Chinese cabbage, taro, or rice noodles can be added as the chef desires. Traditionally, the dish was served with banana, yet today, locals more commonly enjoy it with rice or bread. Bora Bora Le Panda D\u2019Or (Vaitape) Le Panda D\u2019or is the only privately operated Chinese restaurant in Bora Bora. Located in Vaitape, Bora Bora\u2019s main city, travelers will likely pass by it on their way to or from a jet ski tour, shark and ray cruise, or when shuttling between different resorts, thus making it an easy lunch stop on the way to their next destination. Their shrimp-stuffed fish did not disappoint. Resorts At Bora Bora\u2019s world-famous resorts, the\u00a0executive\u00a0chefs and their teams are continually pushing the boundaries of Chinese-Tahitian fusion. The three following resorts I visited all expressed a strong incentive to develop new dishes to keep offerings exciting for their discerning guests. Bamboo (St. Regis Bora Bora) A favorite at this St. Regis Bora Bora restaurant is the\u00a0caramelized pork stir fry. The good-sized, ever-so-slightly fatty pieces of pork are crisped to perfection, and the addition of purple and green cabbage, onions and carrots made the dish visually appetizing. The portions are reasonable so you\u2019ll most likely have room for dessert. The Cocoriander is a must-try \u2013 provided you like coriander. The chocolate \u201ccoconut shell\u201d has freshly made coconut sorbet inside, which can be paired with as much or as little of the side of coriander cream as you please. Although coriander is certainly not an ingredient exclusive to Chinese cuisine, it\u2019s often used for flavoring and/or garnish in China, making the dish stand out as a beautiful example of innovative Chinese-Tahitian fusion. Banyan (Conrad Bora Bora) A modern Chinese restaurant, Banyan offers a local adaptation of a traditional Cantonese dish. Its lovingly hand-crafted Siu Mai (steamed pork and shrimp dumplings) are the five-star version of what you can find at the vibrant Sunday Market in Papeete. They can be enjoyed as presented, but feel free to ask the server for some vinegar or chili paste if you\u2019d like to try them as\u00a0dumplings are sometimes\u00a0eaten in China. All of the fish and shellfish at Banyan is locally sourced and that includes the signature wok-fried spiny lobster. Dishes are served in family-style portions, so expect a gracious amount of lobster meat, covered in a thick yet delicate, home-made XO sauce, a quintessential Hong Kong condiment. Vaimiti (Four Seasons Bora Bora) It\u2019s hard not to have high expectations of the food after seeing this restaurant\u2019s setting. Vaimiti, perched above idyllic cyan waters and pristine white sands, commands incredible views of Mount Otemanu and what might be the world\u2019s most beautiful beach. A menu mainstay of nearly two years here is the Hunan-style Mahi Mahi. \u201cHunan-style\u201d usually suggests a fiery heat, yet this dish has been made more appealing to guests from around the world with chilis that lend a sweet, rather than spicy, note.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/chinese-food-evolution-french-polynesia/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_americas_mexicos-us-deportation-country-of-origin-intl-latam", "text": "Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador said his country is seeking an agreement for the US to deport asylum-seekers and migrants to their countries of origin instead of Mexico. The announcement comes after US President Joe Biden unveiled executive action that would bar people who cross the US-Mexico border illegally from requesting asylum, during periods when there is a high volume of illegal crossings. Unless they meet certain exemptions, the asylum-seekers would be turned away to Mexico or returned to their home countries. The\u00a0president\u2019s proclamation, announced Tuesday, still allows for the normal flow of commerce and legal immigration across the border. Asked whether Biden\u2019s plan could lead to a potential increase of migrants on the Mexican side of the border, Mexico\u2019s president said, \u201cWe are seeking an agreement that if they (the US) make the decision to deport, they do so directly.\u201d L\u00f3pez Obrador added that he is not worried about Mexican border towns being overwhelmed by asylum seekers pushed back by the US. \u201cThey come to Mexico. We have no problem. We treat them all very well (\u2026) but why not a direct agreement?\u201d he said. Biden and L\u00f3pez Obrador also held a phone call on Tuesday, which the Mexican president described as \u201crespectful\u201d and \u201cvery amicable,\u201d saying they spoke about the need to support Latin American nations. A \u2018virtual wall\u2019 While some critics argue Biden\u2019s sweeping migration measure\u00a0doesn\u2019t go far enough in responding to the large numbers of people showing up at the US southern border, others warn that closing the\u00a0border\u00a0to\u00a0asylum\u00a0seekers\u00a0will endanger vulnerable people. In practice, the new rule would imply \u201cclosing the border\u201d to the thousands of refugees who are in Mexico waiting to reach the United States, Tonatiuh Guill\u00e9n, professor at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) and former commissioner of the National Migration Institute of Mexico, told CNN. \u201cIt implies a kind of virtual wall because people are going to be in a scenario where they are going to be rejected. On the other hand, if this measure is implemented, it leaves thousands of people without the possibility of shelter,\u201d Guillen said. Mexican authorities have largely played down any expected impact. A source at Mexico\u2019s asylum commission COMAR also told CNN that the agency is not very concerned about a potential increase in refugee applications \u201cbecause normally, the migrants who reached the northern border of Mexico are not interested in requesting asylum in Mexico.\u201d L\u00f3pez Obrador said what he \u201cliked the most\u201d about his call with Biden was the US\u2019 plan to build three new border bridges. \u201cThis is going to help a lot in the economic and commercial development throughout the region,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/americas/mexicos-us-deportation-country-of-origin-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_middleeast_israel-gaza-un-security-council-ceasefire-intl-hnk", "text": "Israel has vowed to persist with its military operation in Gaza, saying it won\u2019t engage in \u201cmeaningless\u201d negotiations with Hamas, shortly after the United Nations Security Council overwhelmingly approved a US-backed ceasefire plan intended to bring an end to the eight-month war. Israel\u2019s representative to the UN, Reut Shapir Ben-Naftaly, emphasized at a UNSC meeting Monday that her country wants to \u201censure that Gaza doesn\u2019t pose a threat to Israel in the future.\u201d The senior diplomat said the war would not end until all hostages were returned and Hamas\u2019 capabilities were \u201cdismantled,\u201d accusing the Palestinian militant group of using \u201cendless negotiations\u2026 as a means to stall for time.\u201d Her comments came after 14 of the 15 UNSC council members voted in favor of Monday\u2019s US-drafted resolution, with only Russia abstaining \u2013 the first time the council has endorsed such a plan to end the war. Israel is not a member of the\u00a0UNSC, and so did not vote. The comprehensive three-stage peace deal, which sets out conditions intended to lead to the eventual release of all remaining hostages, in return for a permanent ceasefire and withdrawal of Israeli forces, was first laid out by US President Joe Biden on May 31. The landmark vote means the UNSC now joins other major global bodies in backing the plan, increasing international pressure on both Hamas and Israel to end the conflict. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who is on a diplomatic trip to the Middle East, said Tuesday that in a meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu the Israeli leader \u201creaffirmed his commitment\u201d to the current proposal to secure a ceasefire and hostage release, which is still awaiting an answer from Hamas. Blinken said that he got an explicit assurance from Netanyahu that he continues to support the deal, and will accept it if Hamas agrees to what is on the table. Netanyahu has repeatedly and publicly said that his country will press on with the war in Gaza until Hamas is destroyed and the hostages are freed. But an Israeli statement on Tuesday indicated it was poised to formally sign up to the current ceasefire plan for Gaza, while at the same time maintaining the freedom to keep fighting. The short communication issued Tuesday, attributed only to an Israeli government official, though widely understood to mean the Prime Minister\u2019s Office, started with an assertion of Israel\u2019s war aims before expressing support for the US-backed proposal currently on the table. \u201cIsrael will not end the war before achieving all its war objectives: destroying Hamas\u2019s military and governing capabilities, freeing all the hostages and ensuring Gaza doesn\u2019t pose a threat to Israel in the future,\u201d it said. \u201cThe proposal presented enables Israel to achieve these goals and Israel will indeed do so,\u201d the statement concluded. Israel and Hamas react Hamas welcomed the adoption of the UNSC resolution, saying in a statement it was ready to engage with mediators to implement measures such as the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, prisoner exchange, returning residents to their homes and the \u201crejection of any demographic change or reduction in the area of the Gaza Strip.\u201d The resolution says Israel has accepted the plan, and US officials have repeatedly emphasized Israel had agreed to the proposal \u2013 despite other public comments from Netanyahu that suggest otherwise. Even last month, less than an hour after Biden unveiled his proposal, Netanyahu insisted Israel would not end the war until Hamas is defeated. The\u00a0United States\u00a0ambassador to the\u00a0UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said Monday the US would guarantee Israel follows through with its obligations, while Egypt and Qatar would do the same with Hamas. \u201cThe fighting could stop today,\u201d if Hamas agreed to the deal, she said. But detailed negotiations to implement its provisions are yet to yield agreement from both Israel and Hamas. The deal is divided into three phases, according to Thomas-Greenfield. It includes an initial ceasefire, the release of Israeli hostages and the exchange of Palestinian prisoners, and ultimately a permanent end to hostilities and full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, as well as the effective distribution of aid and a major multiyear reconstruction in the strip. The ambassador also said the deal \u201crejects any geographical changes\u201d in Gaza and reiterates the commitment for a two-state solution. The Palestinian UN envoy Riyad\u00a0Mansour said the Palestinian Authority \u2013 which governs\u00a0the Israeli-occupied West Bank \u2013 welcomed the deal as a \u201cstep in the right direction,\u201d but said it was up to Israel to implement those measures. \u201cWe want a ceasefire,\u201d he said, adding the \u201cburden is on the Israeli side to implement this resolution.\u201d \u201cThe proof is in the pudding. We will see who are the ones who are interested to see this resolution to become a reality and those who are obstructing it and want to continue the war of genocide against our people,\u201d he added. US pushes for Israeli support on deal Ahead of the vote, Blinken told Netanyahu during their meeting in Jerusalem that the proposal would \u201cunlock the possibility of calm along\u00a0Israel\u2019s northern border and further integration with countries in the region,\u201d according to a State Department readout. \u201cThe United States and other world leaders will stand behind\u201d the proposal for a release of the hostages and an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, Blinken told Netanyahu. After the resolution was adopted, Blinken spoke with Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, where he \u201ccommended\u00a0Israel\u2019s readiness to conclude a deal and affirmed that the onus is on Hamas to accept,\u201d according to a readout of their meeting. Blinken arrived in Israel on Monday, following the resignation of Benny Gantz from the Israeli war cabinet on Sunday. Gantz\u2019s departure delivered a blow to Netanyahu, who is coming under increasing pressure from Western allies and families of hostages to end the war and bring back the captives. Gantz stressed to Blinken\u00a0in their meeting the importance of \u201capplying maximum pressure\u201d on negotiators to secure Hamas\u2019 agreement to the latest ceasefire plan and bring those being held in Gaza home, according to a statement from Gantz\u2019s office. It added that Gantz said his party would support \u201cany responsible arrangement\u201d on the matter from outside the government. There has been confusion about whose proposal this is, however. Biden has called it an \u201cIsraeli proposal,\u201d but less than an hour after Biden announced the plan in May,\u00a0Netanyahu\u00a0said his country would not end the war until Hamas is defeated. Biden has said Hamas has been degraded to a point where it can no longer carry out the type of attack, and that now \u201cit\u2019s time for this war to end.\u201d The Israeli prime minister, however, is yet to publicly announce whether his country has accepted or rejected the US-drafted proposal. Eight months since the war began, Israel is yet to achieve its stated objectives as most of Hamas\u2019 top leadership remains at large, while earlier this week, Israeli military officials estimated around 120 hostages remain captive, of which around 70 are thought to still be alive. More than 37,000 people have been killed in Gaza since the war began, according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza. CNN cannot verify the\u00a0numbers provided by the ministry, which does not distinguish between casualties among fighters and civilians. It does not include in its figures the several thousand people thought to be missing, or those still under the rubble in\u00a0Gaza\u00a0since October 7.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/middleeast/israel-gaza-un-security-council-ceasefire-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_08_style_jewel-art-music-healing-exhibition-crystal-bridges", "text": "Walking through \u201cThe Portal\u201d \u2014 the immersive art experience that I have created at Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, Arkansas \u2014 is like stepping into a mandala. It embodies my true life\u2019s work: how to heal a broken heart. Working with the team at Crystal Bridges to bring this experience to life reminded me of when I was 18 years old, and was \u201cdiscovered\u201d singing in a small coffee shop in San Diego, California. Back then, Atlantic Records president Danny Goldberg saw something in me, and decided to believe in me. An entire record label ended up rallying behind me and fought alongside me to make my first album, \u201cPieces Of You,\u201d work against all the odds. It was magic. I\u2019m now old enough to know that a person doesn\u2019t always get a magical moment in their life, much less two \u2014 I know the art world has not been sitting around hoping that a folk singer will paint. Or sculpt. Or create an experience weaving together music, behavioral health and wellness, in a fine-art museum, no less. Yet director Rod Bigelow, curator Alejo Benedetti and the entire Crystal Bridges team also chose to believe in me, and work incredibly hard to bring this vision to life. The gratitude I felt standing before the museum\u2019s front doors on opening night nearly brought me to my knees. It did bring me to tears. A journey of art, and affirmation At 40 years old, I decided to take a step back from my career. I quit touring and recording; I was a single mom coming out of a difficult divorce, and I was still recovering financially from the ruin I found myself in after my mom and I parted ways. I had no good strategy for picking myself up again and expecting a different outcome \u2014 I was waving the white flag. I surrendered to going within and learning how to heal in a new way. I created behavioral exercises; I painted and I wrote. But not for the world. For me. Art has always been a medicine I made to heal. Since I was young, I dove into journaling, poetry, and music to help myself understand the painful blows life dealt. I turned to melodies to comfort me at night when I left home at 15. I wrote many of my biggest hits during this time \u2014 songs like, \u201cAngel Standing By,\u201d \u201cHands,\u201d \u201cWho Will Save Your Soul,\u201d and \u201cYou Were Meant for Me.\u201d I also began to carve marble, mold clay and draw around the same time I began writing songs. It helped me synthesize my pain, and I found the different mediums all worked like their own unique tincture. Art is how I turned the poison into medicine, the snake bite into an antidote.\u00a0It helped me understand the world around me \u2014 and who I was independent of it, from the inside out. And so for \u201cThe Portal,\u201d I wanted to focus on that moment when I hit pause on my life, and to bring audiences on my journey from that point to today, 10 years later. It is a journey through what I call the \u201cThree Planes,\u201d a personal philosophy I\u2019ve developed centered around the idea that we each travel through three realms of reality each and every day, often without knowing it: The \u201cInner Plane,\u201d representing our thoughts and feelings; the \u201cSeen Plane,\u201d representing our physical lives \u2014 jobs, families, finances, nature, structure; and the \u201cUnseen Plane,\u201d representing whatever gives a sense of awe and wonder. For some, it\u2019s a clearly-defined spiritual belief or relationship, for others it\u2019s just a feeling, like getting goosebumps when you see images from the James Webb Space Telescope. Multidisciplinary mindfulness Walking through the experience, visitors are guided by a variety of different artworks I have selected to help them define what these realms mean to them (and to me). First, they are greeted by \u201cListen,\u201d a holographic video installation \u2014 brought to life by Protohologram, and pictured above \u2014 I designed to represent the \u201cUnseen Plane.\u201d It incorporates spoken words of a poem I wrote when I pushed that pause button and asked for help. In that moment, I felt like I was not alone. I was comforted, and I was guided to listen with my heart. In the museum\u2019s contemporary art wing, they\u2019ll see an original oil painting, called \u201cDouble Helix,\u201d representing the \u201cSeen Plane.\u201d This is the first time I have ever shown my art; to get to do so in such a prestigious museum setting is a major pinch-me moment. The painting is about my devotion to my son, and of letting go of my music career so I could be fully present for him. After my divorce, I knew my son needed me in a way that was essential \u2014 and I knew if I did not prioritize that need, I would look back and regret it. And I had faith that when it was time to re-start my creative career, I would be led to find a way forward. Here, there is also a sculpture I made titled \u201cCHILL,\u201d made of lucite and filled with a variety of medications. It represents the \u2018Inner Plane,\u2019 and is about the intersection of wellness and medicine; about longevity of life versus quality of life, and my own inner journey of learning how to unwind. Next, visitors are given a journal and invited to walk through the contemporary gallery, in which I was honored to curate 10 pieces from the museum\u2019s permanent collection. It\u2019s here \u2014 and inspired by these artworks \u2014 where I ask them to write down answers to prompts and questions that helped me heal over this past decade. One such prompt, for example is to fill in the blanks to a sentence that changed my life: \u201cI sacrifice my attachment to _____ and I dedicate it to _____.\u201d I use this prompt every day; what I have chosen to work on is sacrificing my attachment to perfectionism and dedicating it to noticing what is going right. The journal is for each visitor to keep. It has open space to draw and reflect more if they choose. One of my goals in this part of the experience was not just to help provide some structure and behavioral health tools, but to create space for community, connection and conversations.\u00a0 It was so rewarding for me to see couples, families and even strangers engaged in meaningful discussions with one another \u2014 I saw parents with tears in their eyes because they got a glimpse into their child\u2019s inner world; grown men hugging after a shared experience neither of them knew the other carried. Finally, visitors are brought outside to watch a 200-piece drone show flown by Nova Sky Stories. In the night sky, these drones create sculptural shapes, choreographed to an original 10-minute piece of music. I feel this music is the most dynamic and interesting of my career. It goes from spoken word to cinematic soundscapes,\u00a0and in and out of several new songs. Why drones? I used them because I know they have the power to create a sense of awe. There is a lot of science behind the power of awe. For me, creating this show and seeing 300 people all with their faces turned to the sky in wonder, their mouths agape, was a magical moment. It is my hope that people leave feeling more connected to themselves and those around them. What it has done for me personally is to finally allow these three areas of my life to come together in one space: to bring my music forward in a new way, to let my visual art be seen by the world for the first time, and to share the tools I\u2019ve created and used to heal. We do not heal through therapy alone. We do not heal through art alone. We do not heal through connection to self or community alone. It happens all together.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/08/style/jewel-art-music-healing-exhibition-crystal-bridges/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_31_europe_far-right-european-election-intl", "text": "This is a historic and pivotal year for democracy across the globe. Around\u00a070 countries\u00a0\u2013 from the\u00a0United States\u00a0to\u00a0South Africa, via\u00a0Mexico\u00a0and\u00a0Taiwan\u00a0\u2013 will hold elections in 2024. After India\u2019s huge and ongoing six-week ballot, however, the biggest election in terms of voter numbers takes place this week, when 373 million Europeans can go to the polls and elect 720 members of the next European Parliament. Once the votes have been tallied from across the 27-nation bloc, it is widely expected that the results will show a significant shift to the right, which could have major implications for the political direction of the European Union at a time\u00a0when it is battling\u00a0multiple crises,\u00a0many of them global. From the war in Ukraine to coping with mass migration, the rise of China to the threat of climate change, it\u2019s hard to see how a bloc of\u00a0diverse\u00a0countries could possibly speak with one voice. Of course, differences in opinion among\u00a0the\u00a0member states is nothing new. EU politics has always relied on awkward alliances between countries and political ideologies that represent vastly different electorates. The EU\u2019s political center has undeniably moved to the right over the past two decades,\u00a0however. The European Parliament is the place where this is most visible at an EU level. Most\u00a0of the lawmakers (known as MEPs)\u00a0belong to a political party in their own country.\u00a0Once they enter\u00a0the European Parliament\u00a0in the Belgian capital of Brussels, they sit in loose, multinational political groupings that broadly have similar political interests. These groupings then form even looser coalitions,\u00a0which\u00a0usually results with a majority grouping of centrists from the center-left, center-right and liberals somewhere in the middle. The rightward shift of the political center in this coalition has been gradual. In 1994, the main socialist group S&D had the most MEPs. In 1999,\u00a0it was\u00a0overtaken by the center-right European People\u2019s Party (EPP). The EPP, best explained as conservatives in the mold of former German Chancellor Angela Merkel,\u00a0has\u00a0been the dominant force in\u00a0EU\u00a0politics ever since. While the EPP has been able to lead a mainstream centrist coalition with the left and liberals at a European level, MEPs are still beholden to domestic politics happening back in their own countries. For example, it\u2019s not easy for a conservative to work with a liberal on a pan-EU policy that would share the burden of asylum seekers if voters back home are becoming attracted to loud, anti-immigration populists. The louder the domestic noise \u2013 and the greater the risk of losing their own seat in parliament \u2013 the trickier cross-party politics at a Brussels level becomes. The anticipated influx of\u00a0lawmakers into groups\u00a0to the EPP\u2019s right will\u00a0certainly\u00a0complicate matters. While the\u00a0right-wing\u00a0European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) and\u00a0far-right\u00a0Identity and Democracy (ID)\u00a0groups\u00a0are expected to finish fourth and fifth respectively in terms of seat numbers, their combined tally, which could be upwards of 140,\u00a0according to the Politico Poll of Polls, will be hard for the EPP to ignore.\u00a0The EPP is currently predicted to win 165 seats to 143 for the socialist S&D. ECR and ID are typical of European\u00a0Parliament\u00a0parties in that they are home to a pretty broad group of conservatives. The ECR, for example, was founded by former British Prime Minister David Cameron who campaigned against Brexit. Its current chair is Italian PM Giorgia Meloni, who garnered lots of attention during the 2022 Italian election for her opposition to\u00a0LGBTQ+\u00a0rights,\u00a0promises to curb migration and general anti-globalist rhetoric. However, since\u00a0Meloni\u2019s\u00a0election, she has been seen as considerably more moderate and has supported many key EU initiatives, including support for Ukraine. She has also resisted allowing\u00a0authoritarian\u00a0Hungarian\u00a0leader\u00a0Viktor Orban to join the ECR after he left the EPP. Hungary has been the most pro-Russia EU voice since the start of the war. Whether or not it was deliberate on Meloni\u2019s part, resistance to Orban has made working with her and the ECR more palatable to the Brussels establishment, including EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. ID, too, has sought to moderate its image. It\u00a0recently expelled\u00a0the German far-right AfD party from its ranks after one of its most senior MEPs told an Italian newspaper\u00a0that he didn\u2019t see all members of the SS, the notorious Nazi paramilitary group, automatically as criminals. There is quite a wide range in opinion from the moderate wing of the ERC to the fringes of ID, but political\u00a0currents\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0desire for influence\u00a0can result in some\u00a0odd bedfellows, especially in the opaque and fluid world of European politics. It is unlikely that the EPP would be willing to work directly with ID any time soon, but that doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t be important. History has shown us repeatedly that it\u2019s possible to influence policy from outside the tent. Suppose\u00a0that\u00a0parties associated with ID start putting center-right\u00a0politicians\u00a0under pressure in their own countries. You might find the center adopts their policy ideas \u2013\u00a0as has previously happened in France, the\u00a0United Kingdom\u00a0and Germany. And there are\u00a0more than\u00a0enough hot topics in Europe now for the right to get its teeth stuck into. Migration, climate change, border security, military spending, rule of law \u2013 all of these have been flashpoints in pan-Europe politics for a long time and are not going away any time soon. And it is ultimately the newly-elected Parliament that vets and approves the\u00a0make-up\u00a0of the\u00a0European\u00a0Commission \u2013 the EU\u2019s executive body. It\u2019s worth noting that support for Ukraine is expected to be safe\u00a0for the time being, with the pro-Kremlin\u00a0groups appearing\u00a0very\u00a0isolated. But almost everything else will be handled on a case-by-case basis if the numbers work out that way. And the more MEPs elected that are to the right of the EPP, the more their influence could grow over time. Five years is a long time in politics, and that is how long this Parliament will last. In that time, France will hold an election that Marine Le Pen, who is affiliated with ID, might win\u00a0with her National Rally party. Geert Wilders, also ID, is soon expected to form a government in the Netherlands after emerging as the biggest party in their\u00a0November\u00a0elections. In other words, the domestic politics in member states could shift even further to the right, which naturally changes calculations in Brussels. The European Parliament\u00a0can often seem like\u00a0looks\u00a0like a boring, bureaucratic blob, tediously grinding its way through process. But the EU is an increasingly geopolitical player \u2013 able to impose sanctions on Russian and Chinese political figures, provide funds to Ukraine and use its economic heft as the world\u2019s largest trading bloc in diplomacy. If its political center is indeed shifting to the right, its influence will inevitably have\u00a0meaningful\u00a0and\u00a0perhaps far-reaching\u00a0consequences for people\u00a0living beyond Europe\u2019s\u00a0borders.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/europe/far-right-european-election-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_sport_caitlin-clark-usa-basketball-olympic-games-omission-spt-intl", "text": "USA Basketball\u2019s decision to omit Caitlin Clark from the Olympic roster was initially met with some shock. How could one of the most prominent, well-known athletes in the US \u2013 not to mention one of the most talented rookies to ever enter the WNBA \u2013 not be on the plane to Paris? Speaking to reporters at a practice on Sunday, Clark said she wasn\u2019t disappointed with the decision, adding: \u201cI think it gives you something to work for, you know, it\u2019s a dream.\u201d \u201cHopefully one day I can be there, and I think it\u2019s just a little more motivation. You remember that and, you know, hopefully in four years, when four years comes back around \u2026 I can be there,\u201d she said. However, USA Basketball has made a \u201cterrible decision,\u201d according to CNN Sport analyst Christine Brennan, by omitting a phenomenon like Clark from the roster. \u2018Hard shots\u2019 From a P.R. perspective, it probably made sense for Clark to make the team. Yet, watching Clark\u2019s teething problems in her first month in the league and going over her early season statistics, her omission perhaps should not have come as a surprise. The physicality of the WNBA has been one her biggest struggles early on and international basketball certainly isn\u2019t any less intense. Part of Clark\u2019s highlight reel so far have been images of the slight point guard picking herself up off the court.\u00a0She\u2019s been on the receiving end of several hard fouls, including some that were whistled as flagrant. \u201cI think at this point I know I\u2019m going to take a couple of hard shots a game and that\u2019s what it is,\u201d Clark said after a recent game against the Chicago Sky. \u201cI\u2019m trying not to let it bother me.\u201d Understandably, Clark is commanding more attention from opponent defenses than perhaps any other player in the league, but she\u00a0has\u00a0yet to find a way to consistently break down those tactics. Through 13 games so far, Clark\u2019s 70 turnovers are by some distance the most of any player in the league and her average of 5.4 turnovers a game is well clear of Alyssa Thomas\u2019s 4.3 in second place. Clark is also shooting just 37.3% from the floor and 33% from three, which is arguably her greatest weapon, and it seems unlikely that the Indiana Fever would command any less attention from opponents on the Olympic stage. On statistics alone, then, it is difficult to justify Clark\u2019s inclusion; though by the same metrics, Diana Taurasi\u2019s inclusion is even more difficult to explain given she is averaging just 16.6 points on just 37.1% shooting, while contributing fewer rebounds, assists and steals per game. \u2018Get rest and get healthy\u2019 Through 13 games this season, the Indiana Fever\u2019s defensive rating of 111.7 is by far the worst in the league, with Clark\u2019s individual defensive struggles at the forefront. Breanna Stewart, a two-time WNBA champion, Brittney Griner, a nine-time All Star and A\u2019ja Wilson, a two-time MVP, have all represented Team USA at an Olympic Games before. Even the 42-year-old Taurasi, a five-time Olympic champion who has largely played poorly so far this season, has been included in part for her vast experience. Plus, there are many talented players Clark is up against for the guard position. Clark would also have been by some distance the youngest and most inexperienced player on the team. Aged 26, Sabrina Ionescu and Jackie Young are the youngest to be selected, but both are already multi-time All-Stars. Additionally, Clark has barely had time to take a breath over the past couple of seasons, leading Iowa to back-to-back NCAA championship games and after the draft almost immediately entering training camp with the Fever ahead of her WNBA debut.  Only\u00a0two\u00a0players this season have played more minutes than Clark, experienced duo Stewart and Betnijah Laney-Hamilton. Long term, for both Clark and the league, a few weeks\u2019 rest could be for the best. The 22-year-old said it\u2019s \u201cgoing to be really nice\u201d\u00a0to have some time off during the Olympics, with the WNBA pausing during the Games. \u201cI\u2019ve loved competing every single second, but it\u2019s going to be a great month for my body,\u201d she told reporters after Fever practice on Sunday. \u201cFirst of all, get rest and get healthy and just get a little time away from basketball and the craziness of everything that\u2019s been going on. Just find some peace and quiet for myself.\u201d Brennan added that team politics may also have contributed to the decision. \u201cI have two sources, impeccable sources, who said that they had heard from various people that a concern was that if Caitlin was put on the team but only got a few minutes of playing time, which would be logical for a rookie on a great team that last lost in 1992 \u2013 the best, most dominant team in sports - that all of her fans would be upset and would be, I guess, just storming the gates and on radio shows and on social media,\u201d she told World Sport\u2019s Don Riddell. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe my ears that that was a discussion topic in the meetings about the reaction to Caitlin Clark,\u201d added Brennan. \u201cAnd is it a situation where we heard chilly comments from Diana Taurasi and Breanna Stewart at the women\u2019s Final Four? I asked Diana Taurasi\u2019s agent point-blank: \u2018Can you point me to anything positive she\u2019s ever said about Caitlin Clark?\u2019 Never heard back, gave the agent a week to reply, and both of those women are on the team.\u201d Stewart had said Clark,\u00a0the all-time scoring leader in men\u2019s and women\u2019s\u00a0NCAA\u00a0Division I history,\u00a0needed to win a national title to be considered one of the greats in women\u2019s college basketball history, while Taurasi said she would take Paige Bueckers, who wasn\u2019t in the 2024 WNBA draft, as the No. 1 overall pick over Clark. Both Stewart and Taurasi later attempted to clarify that their comments about Clark at the Final Four were not intended to be negative. CNN has approached USA Basketball for comment. In an interview with AP on Tuesday, USA Basketball Women\u2019s selection committee chair Jennifer Rizzotti said: \u201cIt would be irresponsible for us to talk about her [Clark] in a way other than how she would impact the play of the team. \u201cBecause it wasn\u2019t the purview of our committee to decide how many people would watch or how many people would root for the U.S. It was our purview to create the best team we could for Cheryl [Reeve].\u201d \u2018The biggest thing in sports\u2019 On the flip side, however, Brennan says Clark\u2019s omission is hard to explain if USA Basketball is interested in exposure and growing women\u2019s basketball. \u201cShe\u2019s the biggest thing in sports, not just women\u2019s basketball in the United States,\u201d Brennan said of why Clark should be included. \u201cI mean, literally very, very likely the best-known athlete in the country right now. \u201cBecause she\u2019s playing great.\u00a0Because she represents the college side of the game \u2026 and because she can help them win. Especially three-pointers in the international game are a must and she\u2019s an excellent player. \u201cHer stats are better than Diana Taurasi, who will be on the team\u00a0for her sixth run at an\u00a0Olympic gold medal, and so the bottom line is she brings eyeballs.\u201d According to the WNBA, the 2024 season opened with the highest attendance in 26 years and the most watched games in history on national television, a boom fuelled in no small part by interest in Clark. The former Iowa star\u2019s\u00a0professional debut in May drew the largest WNBA audience in two decades. Having Clark on the team could arguably have helped\u00a0grow\u00a0the women\u2019s game globally, giving fans from around the world a better chance to see a phenomenon in action. How many tickets were bought by those hoping to see Clark on the court? How many more would have tuned in to watch to find out for themselves why America is so enthralled by this generational talent? \u201cYou will have the world watching. It will grow women\u2019s sports. There\u2019ll be kids in Africa and Europe who will see number 22 and want to buy the jersey and who would watch - and then maybe go out and shoot baskets,\u201d Brennan added. \u201cAn empowering moment for girls and women that has been totally missed by this, what I believe is a terrible decision and by USA Basketball.\u201d It would also have been far from unprecedented for a rookie to make the team. Previously, four WNBA rookies - Rebecca Lobo in 1996, Diana Taurasi in 2004, Candace Parker in 2008 and Breanna Stewart in 2016 \u2013 have been selected for Team USA\u2019s Olympic rosters, while Christian Laettner made the 1992 \u2018Dream Team\u2019 roster as an NBA rookie. \u201cOften USA Basketball men\u2019s and women\u2019s will pick a collegiate \u2026 as an homage, as a bit of a tip of the hat to the college game and the growth of the game, which is in the mission\u00a0in\u00a0statement of USA Basketball, growing the game,\u201d Brennan explains. With or without Clark, Team USA is the overwhelming favorite to win gold in Paris and continue its unbeaten Olympic record stretching back to 1992. Clark will just have to wait a little longer to join the squad.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/sport/caitlin-clark-usa-basketball-olympic-games-omission-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_10_middleeast_inside-israels-hostage-rescue-intl-dst", "text": "Three days after an Israeli military operation rescued four hostages being held by Hamas in Nuseirat refugee camp, central Gaza, killing more than 270 Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials, new details are still emerging about what was one of the most dramatic and deadly events since the war started. The daytime rescue operation, which took weeks of planning, caught militants holding hostages in two different buildings in a densely packed civilian area off guard. It appeared to have been carried out by Israeli forces using non-military vehicles, including a white Mercedes van, according to eyewitnesses, whose accounts tallied with videos analyzed by CNN. Eyewitnesses also said that they saw Israeli forces in disguise \u2013 dressed as Hamas fighters or civilians. \u201cThey were dressed in military uniforms like resistance fighters, carrying helmets and wearing signs of the [Hamas] resistance, giving the impression to people that they were resistance fighters, but in reality, they were an Israeli special forces unit,\u201d Khalil Al Tirawi, a local resident, told CNN. The Israeli military denied using civilian vehicles, but declined to say whether the officers conducting the rescue were disguised as militants or dressed as Palestinian civilians. The Israeli military had previously used civilian clothing as a tactic in its operations. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the units on the ground were given the \u201cgo\u201d at 11 a.m. local time and, by 11:25 a.m., began the raids simultaneously on both buildings where militants were holding the hostages \u2014 Noa Argamani, Almog Meir Jan, Andrey Kozlov and Shlomi Ziv, all of whom were taken on October 7 from the Nova music festival in Hamas\u2019 deadly cross-border terror attack. The Israeli soldiers managed to reach the apartment where guards were holding Argamani \u2014 pictured in a viral video being driven to Gaza on the back of a motorbike \u2013 undetected. \u201cIn Noa Argamani\u2019s building, we surprised them completely,\u201d Adm. Daniel Hagari, an IDF spokesman, said. But soon after the mission got underway, Israeli soldiers and militants began to exchange fire, according to eyewitness accounts and statements from the Israeli military. Eyewitnesses said that heavy bombardment followed, with missiles and rockets raining down on the densely packed camp, home to thousands of displaced families. A 45-second edited helmet camera video released Monday by the Israeli police and the Israeli Security Agency showed the moment the three male hostages were rescued. Heavy gunfire could be heard throughout the video, intensifying after the hostages left the building, and two soldiers were seen wearing uniforms. By the time that the hostages, referred to by the code name \u201cdiamonds,\u201d\u00a0were brought to the Mediterranean coast and successfully evacuated in two helicopters, the operation had left a deadly trail of destruction in its wake. The latest figures from Gazan authorities say 274 Palestinians were killed and 698 injured \u2013 which would mark one of the deadliest days in months for people living in Gaza. The IDF has disputed those numbers, saying it estimated the number of casualties from the operation was \u201cunder 100.\u201d CNN cannot independently verify either side\u2019s figures. Gaza\u2019s health ministry does not distinguish between civilians and militants. \u2018We felt like it was the apocalypse\u2019 The IDF said that two teams from an Israeli police counter-terrorism special forces unit were sent into the two apartment buildings in the camp to retrieve the hostages simultaneously out of concern that if Hamas realized\u00a0there was a rescue operation ongoing in one building, they might kill the hostages in the other. As Argamani was extracted by Israeli forces, in the other apartment 200 meters away, where the three male hostages were being held, a gunfight broke out, according to the IDF. The IDF said a counter-terrorism special forces squad commander in the Yamam (National Police Counter-Terrorism Unit), Arnon Zamora,\u00a0was fatally wounded in that gunfight. Al Tirawi and another man, both of\u00a0whom are living across from where part of the rescue operation took place, in the center of Nuseirat refugee camp, said that they saw Israeli soldiers arrive in civilian cars in disguise. Abdullah Jouda, who was displaced from Jabalia to Nuseirat camp during the war, told CNN that he heard noises on the street around 11:30 a.m. and went to see what was happening. When he opened the door, he said he saw\u00a0men, who he believes were Israeli forces, leaving a Mercedes van dressed in all black and wearing the emblem for Hamas\u2019 military wing Al Qassam Brigades. \u201cI saw special forces, as soon as they left the vehicle, they had ladders on the balcony and [were] climbing them \u2026 I only saw them for approximately two seconds because if I looked at them longer, I could have been killed,\u201d Jouda said. \u201cThere was heavy gunfire \u2026 almost everything was being fired on. Warplanes were firing, drones were firing, sound grenades. It was terrifying, we felt like it was the apocalypse.\u201d CNN could not independently verify his claims, but a\u00a0video showed a white Mercedes van, with mattresses, plastic bags and other objects strapped to its roof \u2013 a frequent sight in the camp, where many people have sought shelter from the war, their belongings in tow \u2013\u00a0was parked on a street where the operation unfolded. Two ladders could be seen leaning up against a multistorey building next to the van, reaching up to a higher floor. A body appears to be visible on the ground in front of the truck. \u201cThere they are. They are still there!\u201d a woman filming the 6 second clip can be heard saying. The video of the hostage rescue shared by Israeli police and the Israeli Security Agency was geolocated to the same location by CNN. The IDF said its forces came under heavy fire from militants, including with rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs), and that it responded with strikes to support the team on the ground as the extraction efforts continued. \u201cThey were firing RPGs and firing at our forces \u2026 the cynical way that Hamas is using the population to fire at our forces, embedding themselves in the civilians is tragic,\u201d Hagari said, adding that there was \u201cso much fire was on our forces, we needed to fire from the air and from the street.\u201d In one video shared with CNN by local journalist Fadi Thabet, two US-made air-to-ground hellfire missiles can be seen flying in different directions at 11:28 a.m., according to its metadata. One appears to hit the opposite side of the building where the white Mercedes van was parked outside, while the other impacts another building nearby. Footage from the aftermath of the strike shows both the van and building destroyed. Two explosive weapons experts, Trevor Ball, a former US army explosive ordnance disposal technician, and Richard Weir, senior crisis and conflict researcher at Human Rights Watch, confirmed the munitions. The intense aerial bombardment destroyed apartment buildings and vehicles throughout Nuseirat camp, according to witnesses and video footage. \u201cGunfire was coming from multiple sources, but we couldn\u2019t witness everything as anyone who tried to look would be at risk of being killed,\u201d Al Tirawi said.\u00a0\u201cIt is beyond imagination \u2013 a barrage of heavy gunfire, artillery missiles, rockets.\u201d Another local resident, Nidal Abdo, was buying groceries at the market in Nuseirat when he said the strikes intensified.\u00a0\u201cMaybe 150 rockets fell in less than 10 minutes, while we were running away more fell on the market,\u201d he said, adding that he had never witnessed anything like it in Gaza before.\u00a0\u201cThey wiped out Nuseirat, it is hell on earth.\u201d \u2018The diamonds have taken off\u2019 In another video from Al Jazeera, verified by CNN, a truck emblazoned with a brand of dishwashing soap, resembling a vehicle commonly used to bring aid in Gaza, could be seen traveling on a road accompanied by a tank and Israeli armored vehicles about a mile from the refugee camp. The vehicles headed away from the camp and in the direction of an area near the US military\u2019s floating pier on the Mediterranean coast, where the extraction took place. CNN was not able to verify the time the video was filmed, so could not determine whether it took place before or after the raid. The Israeli military denied using the US-built pier in the operation. A senior Biden administration official tells CNN that Israeli forces did not use an aid truck in the operation. As for the use of the US pier, the official said: \u201cThey landed close to the pier but not on it.\u201d The IDF said two helicopters were used to evacuate the hostages, one of which they later shared footage of. The first helicopter evacuated Argamani and the second transported the three male hostages along with the then-wounded, Zamora, who later died in hospital. A video geolocated by CNN shows a helicopter taking off from the beach in Gaza, close to the US floating pier. The IDF released a video on Sunday capturing the moment that military officials first heard that the three male hostages had also been successfully rescued. In it,\u00a0Maj. Gen. Yaron Finkelman, who commands the Southern Command of the IDF, can be heard saying, \u201cThe three diamonds have just taken off to the landing towards the country.\u201d The IDF said it got intelligence on the location of the hostages through different avenues, including from the United States. A US official told CNN that an American cell in Israel supported the efforts to rescue four Israeli hostages, working with Israeli forces on the operation, referring to a team that\u2019s been in place supporting Israel since October 7 with information gathering about the hostages. \u201cThere were no US forces, no US boots on the ground involved in this operation,\u201d national security adviser Jake Sullivan told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash on \u201cState of the Union.\u201d Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office said that the prime minister had approved the rescue operation last Thursday and was present in the command room during the operation. Preparations for the raid began weeks ago and hundreds of personnel from the Israeli military, domestic intelligence service and police special unit were involved, Hagari said, adding that they opted to carry it out during the day to afford them a greater element of surprise. As part of their preparations, the military built models of the apartments the hostages were held in after receiving intelligence regarding their location Hagari told journalists Saturday that similar raids had been called off at the last minute \u201cmore than three or four times\u201d due to unfavorable conditions for Israeli special forces. He did not specify whether those operations concerned the same four hostages or others held in Gaza. Most of the other hostages are not being held in conditions that would allow for similar operations, he said. Hostages being held in Gaza are frequently moved to different locations, Hagari said, adding that Argamani had previously been held elsewhere. After their evacuation, the hostages were then flown to Sheba Medical Center in Ramat Gan, near Tel Aviv. Argamani was later transferred to Ichilov Hospital in Tel Aviv to be treated alongside her mother who has late-stage brain cancer.

{"id": "travel_flight-attendants-surviving-long-haul-plane-flights", "text": "Any air travel can be stressful, but facing down a long-haul flight can be especially intimidating. Should you prioritize sleeping or eating, or both? Should you attempt to exercise in the aisle? Is it ever acceptable to take off your shoes? Kris Major is a British flight attendant with 25 years\u2019 experience. He\u2019s worked short-haul hops and spent 14-hour stretches in the sky. He\u2019s endured journeys with an unenviable number of layovers, and he\u2019s become an expert in refueling via power naps at 30,000 feet. As many of us prepare for long-haul trips over the summer, Major tells CNN Travel his tips and tricks on surviving multiple hours in the sky. Should you eat before or during an overnight flight? If you\u2019re catching a night flight and you want to maximize sleep on board, Major suggests eating before boarding. This is particularly important if the flight is on the shorter end of the long-haul scale: if you\u2019re traveling from New York to London, for example, at best you\u2019re looking at around five or six hours sleep, so you want to make the most of that rest time. Major, who also represents European flight attendants and pilots as chair of the European Transport Workers\u2019 Federation\u2019s Joint Aircrew Committee, says it\u2019s telling that most business travelers shut their eyes as soon as they get on board. \u201cThe seasoned travelers, after takeoff, you go down the cabin and you can see that they\u2019re gone \u2013 they\u2019ve covered themselves up and they\u2019re asleep,\u201d he says. Still, Major admits that eating before flying isn\u2019t always doable, because of long security lines and busy airport terminals. Even if you have the best intentions, you can end up settling for a sad-looking sandwich as you run to the gate. If you\u2019re flying business or first class, you also might be tempted to make the most of food and drink offered on board \u2013 it\u2019s hard to turn down complimentary champagne, after all. But realistically, the cabin food and drink service can take a good two hours, so you\u2019re losing valuable rest time \u2013 and your Business Class ticket should give you access to an airport lounge, so max out those facilities instead, and board the plane well-fueled and ready to rest. So when should you eat on the plane? If you\u2019re flying long-haul, you\u2019ll likely be offered more than one meal during the course of the flight. Meal times start to feel a bit arbitrary when you\u2019re crossing multiple time zones, but should you eat whenever food is offered to you? Or should you turn meals down if you\u2019re not hungry or trying to sleep? Major says passengers should do whatever\u2019s right for their travel schedule. If you\u2019re exhausted, you\u2019re better off sleeping than forcing yourself to eat dinner at the equivalent of 3 a.m. \u201cMost airlines don\u2019t particularly plan their [food] service around the passenger and acclimatization and time zones crossing,\u201d explains Major. Should you bring a travel pillow or rely on the airline offerings? Airlines usually provide pillows for long-haul travelers, no matter the cabin, but Major says bringing your own eye mask, travel pillow and/or a blanket could be a good idea depending on your preferences. Eye masks are great if you\u2019re trying to sleep when the cabin lights are on, while you might prefer your own travel pillow to the airline version. Plus, while it\u2019s rare, there\u2019s always the chance that pillows are unavailable \u2013 something that could be a big problem on a 14-hour flight. \u201cIt happens,\u201d says Major. \u201cSo I would say, cater yourself for your own comfort and your own needs as much as you possibly can.\u201d What if you can\u2019t sleep? Many of us find it difficult to sleep on airplanes, whether due to unfamiliar noises or, for the cheaper seats, limited leg room and upright positions. Struggling to sleep on a long flight, knowing you\u2019re going to pay for the lost hours when you land, can be an unpleasant cycle of worry. Should you persevere and keep trying, or give up and watch a movie? Major says there\u2019s no point trying to force sleep, particularly if your body clock thinks it\u2019s the middle of the day and you\u2019re simply not tired. But he cautions that it\u2019s important to bear in mind what you\u2019re doing at the other end. If you\u2019re going to be driving, for example, or going straight to a meeting, you should try and rest as much as you can. What are the flight attendant rest areas like? Crew rest areas exist on all airplanes, but what these rest areas look like depends on the airline, aircraft and the length of the flight. \u201cIf we\u2019re going somewhere over, say, 13 hours, we need to have good rest areas,\u201d says Major, who explains flight attendants should typically be entitled to breaks that allow for 90 minutes of sleep. That way, they\u2019ve completed a full sleep cycle before they\u2019re back to work. \u201cYou need at least one sleep cycle scientifically to be of any use, to keep your ability to operate safely, your decision making processes, your communication skills,\u201d says Major. Flight attendants need to be alert throughout the journey, so they will take it in turns to refuel via mid-flight power naps. Major says he finds sleeping in crew rest areas pretty easy, but he knows flight attendants who find it tough to sleep in beds that Major calls \u201ctechnically coffins.\u201d \u201cThere are some crew that really struggle with the bunks, they\u2019re not pleasant,\u201d says Major. \u201cYou push yourself right in, so they\u2019re long and thin, because they\u2019re up in the aircraft, so there\u2019s not a lot of space. They are like what you\u2019d imagine you\u2019d see on a submarine.\u201d Flight attendants will usually opt to get changed out of their uniform and into loungewear before squeezing into the bunks. Major says he always packs a T-shirt and some comfortable lounge pants. As he\u2019s a senior flight attendant, Major will hang his tie on the exterior of his bunk\u2019s curtain before he closes his eyes. \u201cSo that if there\u2019s any emergency whilst I\u2019m in the bunk, they know exactly which one I\u2019m in, even though there\u2019s usually one designated for the senior,\u201d Major explains. Do you have any tips on feeling fresh after sleeping on a plane? We\u2019ve all experienced waking up after a mid-flight sleep, groggily heading to the airplane bathroom to freshen up, and alarming yourself when you catch sight of your exhausted reflection. Major\u2019s top tip for feeling refreshed following inflight rest might sound obvious, but he insists it makes a world of difference. \u201cCleaning your teeth is always the one that freshens everybody up the most,\u201d he says, adding that flight attendants will always have between five and 10 minutes to freshen up before they\u2019re back on duty. That\u2019s enough time to get dressed, wash and, if you need to, comb hair and refresh makeup. Flight attendants will greet a returning colleague with a cup of tea or coffee. Then they\u2019ll head off duty for their own rest period. Should you exercise on a long-haul flight? Sitting in the same upright position for hours on end is uncomfortable, but it\u2019s not always easy to get up to stretch. The seat belt sign might be switched on, or you might want to avoid disturbing your seat neighbor. Major stresses that even just wiggling your toes while sitting in your seat is worthwhile. \u201cDo move around in your seat, move your legs, do what comes naturally \u2013 wiggle, move, get the blood flowing if that\u2019s what you need to do. For people that have got circulatory issues, talk to your doctor,\u201d he says. What\u2019s your perspective on passengers taking off their shoes? For many passengers, this is a controversial question due to concerns about smelly feet. But Major encourages anyone on a long-haul flight to remove shoes for comfort, and to help their circulation. Flight attendants don\u2019t care, he says. \u201cWe do it ourselves. I think most people do it themselves. It\u2019s the right thing to do if you\u2019re going on a long-haul flight,\u201d he says. \u201cOne would hope that you\u2019ve had the common decency to have a bath or a shower and put clean socks or stockings or tights on before you get on the aircraft. That\u2019s the only issue, if your feet smell.\u201d Major adds that it\u2019s polite, if you think there\u2019s a chance of feet odor, to \u201cgo to the washroom and do something about it.\u201d But flight attendants, he says, are more worried about passengers sticking out their feet into the aisle. \u201cOn a night flight particularly, if you put your feet in the aisle and you\u2019ve got dark socks on, we won\u2019t see you, and we\u2019ll trip over you, and it\u2019s a bit of a nuisance for us.\u201d What\u2019s the best seat to book for a long flight? If you\u2019re worried about turbulence, Major advises that you try to sit near the front of the aircraft. \u201cYou could be standing at the front and feel nothing, and down the back they\u2019re bouncing all over the place \u2013 the aircraft moves differently down the back,\u201d he explains. If you\u2019re tall, booking the emergency exit seat for the extra leg room could be worthwhile, although Major says it\u2019s worth remembering \u201cyou can\u2019t put your bags down at your feet or anything because it needs to be clear as an evacuation run.\u201d Airlines also sometimes charge extra for seats with leg room. Major\u2019s personal choice on a long-haul flight is booking a window seat. \u201cThat\u2019s purely preferential, I can lean up against the bulkhead, pull my head down and go to sleep. Whereas you can\u2019t when you\u2019re in the aisle seats or the middle seat,\u201d he says. The middle seat is never enviable, but it\u2019s perhaps particularly unappealing on a long flight. Major reckons it\u2019s worth paying extra for the aisle or window, especially \u201cif you need to sleep on the flight.\u201d Should I invest in noise-canceling headphones and bring my iPad on board? The way we consume TV and movies has changed drastically over the past decade, but inflight entertainment has largely stayed unchanged. While many of us still enjoy watching new movie releases on board flights, it\u2019s less of a novelty than it once was. Many passengers prefer binging a pre-downloaded streaming show on a personal device. \u201cMost people self-cater flights now when it comes to entertainment,\u201d says Major. Your own devices are also a good back-up in case there are issues with the in-flight entertainment system, which Major admits \u201cmight not always be working.\u201d Flight attendants usually have handbooks that advise how to operate the inflight screens, but they\u2019re not always able to fix the problem. \u201cThere\u2019s only so much we can do on the aircraft to kick it back to life if it starts to play up,\u201d says Major. \u201cThere\u2019s very little we can do, apart from the usual scientific \u2018turn it off, turn it on again.\u2019\u201d Most aircraft today have USB charging sockets, but a portable charger could also give you added piece of mind. As a flight attendant, do you judge passengers\u2019 movie choices? Major says in his experience, crew aren\u2019t paying too much attention to what you\u2019ve opted to watch on board, but occasionally he\u2019ll comment on a traveler\u2019s choice. \u201cWe can use it as an ice breaker,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I\u2019ve seen a movie and it\u2019s good, it\u2019s something to use to strike up conversation.\u201d Major does recall once noticing a Business Class passenger reading a book which included some graphic descriptions. \u201cThe words were pretty pornographic although I couldn\u2019t see enough to follow the thread,\u201d Major says. The man was reading the book quite openly, and made no attempts to hide the contents. \u201cI was quite shocked,\u201d says Major. \u201cTurned out we were taking a group of sex therapists to a conference.\u201d Should you bring your own food and snacks? Absolutely, says Major. \u201cOn most flights, people forget that you get on the plane, you\u2019re not going to eat for the first hour, at least \u2013 it\u2019s probably going to be an hour and a half after takeoff before you eat,\u201d he says. If you have a health condition like diabetes, bringing your own sustenance is particularly key. It\u2019s also important to pack snacks if you\u2019re traveling with kids. I\u2019m taking my kids on a long-haul flight, what should I do? Major has young kids of his own, so he says he can answer this question both as a father and as a flight attendant. \u201cIf you\u2019re tense, your child will be tense, it\u2019s as simple as that. If you\u2019re stressed, and you\u2019re feeling anxious, your child will be anxious,\u201d he says. Flight attendants are experienced at talking kids and parents through the flying process, Major adds. \u201cBecause we\u2019re just generally very relaxed, we can calm them down very quickly,\u201d he says. When babies are crying, parents are panicking and other passengers are sighing, Major says he\u2019ll always handle the situation in the same way. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure it\u2019s audible for everyone else to hear, I\u2019ll say: \u2018Please don\u2019t worry about it. Don\u2019t worry about your child crying. It\u2019s helping your child rebalance their ears. It\u2019s the only way they can do it, through screaming. We\u2019ve all been children, we\u2019ve all cried, don\u2019t worry about it.\u2019 I\u2019ll try to put the parents at ease. By putting the parent at ease, we can hopefully settle the child.\u201d Major says bringing favorite toys and blankets on the aircraft can also help calm a child, as it helps the alien airplane environment seem more familiar and comforting. How do you deal with nervous passengers on long-haul flights? Those with a fear of flying are, in Major\u2019s experience, worried about one of two things. Either it\u2019s the \u201clack of control\u201d and the \u201calien environment.\u201d Or it\u2019s fear of the airplane crashing. Some people are reassured by Major walking them through the mechanics of the aircraft \u2013 explaining that unknown engine noises are normal, or that air travel is generally very safe and there are many fail-safes in place. Others would rather not know the ins and outs, they just need distracting. Major once spent two hours on board a flight chatting with a nervous passenger in the galley, taking their mind off the situation. Even for those who aren\u2019t generally afraid of flying, long-haul journeys present their own set of pressure points that can drive people into panic mode. Crying babies might be viewed as more of an annoyance on a short flight, but passengers can \u201cfreak,\u201d as Major puts it, if they think that\u2019s set to be their soundtrack for the next 12 hours. Delays to any flights are frustrating, but on longer flights, delays can suddenly hammer home \u201cthe reality of distance and time,\u201d says Major. But Major says it\u2019s important to remember that \u201cthere\u2019s always taxiing time built into the flight time.\u201d \u201cYou can make up time on long-haul a lot easier than short-haul,\u201d he adds. \u201cYou can pick up a good half hour.\u201d What\u2019s your opinion on AirTags? Major\u2019s never used an AirTag, but he understands the attraction \u2013 especially for passengers who\u2019ve dealt with a lost bag in the past. Although it\u2019s a different story when he travels with his family, Major says he usually travels carry-on only, even on long-haul flights. That\u2019s less because he\u2019s worried about losing luggage, and more for ease and speed. \u201cOn my own, I\u2019ve got one bag that I can live for a week out of, it\u2019s so finely tuned,\u201d he says. \u201cI fly with hand luggage only so I can get through the airport as quickly as possible.\u201d If you\u2019ve got a layover, how should you maximize that time? If you\u2019ve got several hours before the next leg of your journey, it could be worth booking a hotel room to catch up on sleep, says Major, who also advises stretching your legs and walking around as much as possible. If there\u2019s enough time to leave the airport and get some fresh air, that\u2019s worth doing too. Major knows what he\u2019s talking about, he once did a mammoth journey with multiple airport layovers, \u201cfrom Cairns - Brisbane, Brisbane - Sydney, Sydney - Abu Dhabi, Abu Dhabi - Vienna, Vienna - Frankfurt, Frankfurt - [London] Gatwick.\u201d \u201cWhen I got off, I was nearly dead,\u201d he jokes. What\u2019s your perspective on the super long-haul flights that could be a thing of the future? The longest flight Major\u2019s ever worked was around 14 hours. The longest scheduled flight currently in operation is Singapore Airlines\u2019 New York to Singapore flight, which lasts 18 hours and 40 minutes. Australian airline Qantas is preparing to launch its ultra long-haul \u201cProject Sunrise\u201d flights, which would span upwards of 19 hours flying passengers from New York and London to Sydney, Australia. For flight attendants, Major says, that will involve working over periods in excess of 24 hours. \u201cYou\u2019re missing two nights of sleep,\u201d says Major. \u201cThe impact of that we don\u2019t fully understand.\u201d It\u2019s still early days, says Major, and these details need to be ironed out. But he sees ultra long-haul as the \u201cevolution of flying.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got the aircraft to do it now, so we need to find ways of doing it,\u201d says Major. \u201cAnd we will. There\u2019s a lot of work going on to do that.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/flight-attendants-surviving-long-haul-plane-flights/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_10_asia_chinese-military-harass-dutch-warship-intl-hnk-ml", "text": "A Dutch warship\u00a0was harassed by Chinese military aircraft in the East China Sea on Friday,\u00a0the Netherlands said, becoming the latest\u00a0country to accuse Beijing\u2019s forces of initiating potentially unsafe encounters in international waters. In a statement Friday, the Dutch Defense Ministry said two Chinese fighter jets circled the frigate HNLMS Tromp several times, while its marine patrol helicopter was \u201capproached\u201d by two Chinese warplanes and a helicopter during a patrol. \u201cThis created a potentially unsafe situation,\u201d the statement said. CNN has asked the Chinese government for comment on the Dutch accusations. The Tromp was operating in the East China Sea in support of a multinational coalition enforcing United Nations sanctions on North Korea, known as the Pacific Security Maritime Exchange (PSMX), according to a statement from the European Union. The UN Security Council has passed multiple resolutions since 2006 imposing sanctions on North Korea for its nuclear weapons program. PSMX partner nations include Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, the United Kingdom and the United States, according to the US State Department. Before patrolling in the East China Sea, the Dutch frigate had made a port call in Busan, South Korea, where it participated in exercises with the South Korean Navy, the EU statement said. Tromp joins a growing list of vessels and aircraft that have accused China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army of conducting possibly unsafe maneuvers in the East and South China Seas and beyond in recent years. Last month, Australia accused a Chinese fighter jet of firing flares into the path of a naval helicopter operating from the destroyer HMAS Hobart over international waters of the Yellow Sea. The Hobart was also enforcing UN sanctions on North Korea. \u201cThis was an unsafe maneuver which posed a risk to the aircraft and personnel,\u201d a statement from Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles said at the time. China defended that action by its military and rejected Australia\u2019s claim that the interception was unsafe. \u201cUnder the guise of implementing United Nations Security Council resolutions, Australian warships and aircraft deliberately approached China\u2019s airspace to cause trouble and provocation, endangering China\u2019s maritime and air security,\u201d Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian told reporters at a regular briefing last month. \u201cAs a warning, the Chinese military took necessary measures at the scene. Relevant operations are legal, compliant, professional and safe.\u201d The incident was similar to\u00a0an encounter\u00a0in late October, when Canada said a Chinese fighter jet fired flares into the path of a Canadian military helicopter over the South China Sea. \u201cThe risk to a helicopter in that instance is the flares moving into the rotor blades or the engines so this was categorized as both unsafe and non-standard, unprofessional,\u201d Maj. Rob Millen, air officer aboard the Royal Canadian Navy frigate HMCS Ottawa, told CNN after the October incident. China also defended its actions in that incident and accused Canadian forces of conducting an unspecified \u201cmalicious and provocative act with ulterior motives.\u201d Two weeks before the South China Sea encounter, a Royal Canadian Air Force patrol plane reported an unsafe intercept by a Chinese jet while it was supporting the UN enforcement of sanctions on North Korea. China, which says its forces act in accordance with international law while protecting Chinese interests, has repeatedly claimed that US-led alliances in the Pacific are a threat to its security. Earlier this month in a speech to the Shangri-La Dialogue defense summit in Singapore, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Washington had made \u201chistoric progress\u201d in developing alliances and partnerships that have enhanced security in Asia in the past three years. In a Q&A session, a Chinese colonel asked Austin whether the US is planning to build a NATO-like alliance system in the Asia-Pacific region, and also blamed NATO for the Ukraine war. Hours later, a Chinese military spokesman accused the United States of \u201ccreating division and provoking confrontation\u201d in the region. \u201cThe US keeps creating chaos and has become the source of risks, as well as the destroyer to peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region,\u201d Jing Jianfeng, deputy chief of the Joint Staff Department at China\u2019s Central Military Commission, told reporters in Singapore.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/asia/chinese-military-harass-dutch-warship-intl-hnk-ml/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_africa_jacob-zuma-comeback-south-africa-elections-intl", "text": "South Africa\u2019s African National Congress (ANC) party faces a mammoth challenge as it needs to form a government with its political rivals after suffering a seismic blow in last week\u2019s election. On Wednesday, the ANC\u2019s national spokesperson insisted that any coalition government would be in the interests of unity and stability and hinted at a government of national unity of some kind. \u201cThe ANC has taken the position that we must all act in the interest of our country and its people, and work on a national consensus on the form of government that is best suited to move South Africa forward at this moment in our history,\u201d Mahlengi Bhengu-Motsiri told a press briefing. Still, some of the same parties that sought the ANC\u2019s demise will now have to play a part in governing South Africa. For decades, the ANC could rule alone, but support for the the party plummeted to around 40% in last Wednesday\u2019s elections, down from 57% in 2019. Analysts and opinion polls had forecast losses for the ANC but a pivotal factor in the party\u2019s staggering decline was former President Jacob Zuma and his newly formed uMkhonto weSizwe (MK) party, which capitalized on widespread discontent within the ANC\u2019s traditional voter base. Zuma\u2019s revenge Zuma \u2013 a fierce critic of current ANC leader and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa \u2013 was forced to resign as president in 2018 and has been looking for political revenge ever since. His MK party, named after the ANC\u2019s former armed wing, appears to have achieved just that \u2013 formed just five months ago, it is now the third-largest party in South Africa, receiving almost 15% of the vote. Zuma positioned MK as \u201ca party that is meant to restore the ANC to its former glory,\u201d said political analyst Tessa Dooms, programmes director at the Rivonia Circle non-profit organization/political think tank in Johannesburg. She says many MK voters saw this ballot as a protest vote. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen with the MK party is the use of a vote to send a signal to the ANC of the level of unhappiness, not only of the country itself but within its ranks who\u2019ve supported it over the last 30 years,\u201d Dooms told CNN. Despite Zuma being barred from running for parliament by the Constitutional Court because of a previous contempt of court violation, the 82-year-old\u2019s\u00a0face remained on the ballot paper. Zuma is no stranger to controversy or the courtroom. He\u202fhas faced\u202fhundreds of corruption, fraud and racketeering charges\u202fover the years. He has always denied all of them and became known as the \u201cTeflon President\u201d because few politicians could have survived the scandals he weathered. Ramaphosa replaced him as president when Zuma was finally forced to resign. Later revelations of \u201cstate capture\u201d \u2013 or rampant corruption riveted the nation in an anti-corruption commission. Much of the focus was on Zuma\u2019s relationship with the influential and wealthy Gupta brothers. With the ANC\u2019s popularity now at an all-time low and as Ramaphosa\u2019s political future hangs in the balance, Zuma could have the last laugh. But it is too early to tell. Due to the poor election showing, South Africa\u2019s political landscape has been fundamentally altered, leaving the ANC with the daunting task of forming a coalition government. In many countries, coalition talks can take months, but South Africa\u2019s constitution gives rival parties a short window to do something they have never really done before: come together. According to the constitution, rival parties have a mere 14 days to create a coalition after the final election results are announced. The outcome of these talks will likely\u00a0determine Ramaphosa\u2019s future as president. Ramaphosa\u2019s\u00a0allies\u00a0in the party are digging in. On Sunday, ANC Secretary-General Fikile Mbalula warned potential coalition partners that the president\u2019s resignation is \u201cnot going to happen.\u201d \u201cI think the ANC has many factors to consider in terms of how it forms a government \u2013 both the stability of the country at large but also for the sake of having a government that still holds to the values of the ANC that it has long said that it serves,\u201d Dooms told CNN. The potential coalition partners present starkly different political ideologies and policy priorities. A marriage of convenience First, there is the official opposition Democratic Alliance (DA), a broadly centrist and pro-business party that has heavily criticized the ANC for many years. Led by John Steenhuisen, it is seen by many\u00a0as a party for White South Africans, something the DA rejects. Steenhuisen has not ruled out going into a coalition with the ANC. A DA-ANC alliance, however it would form, would likely keep Ramaphosa in his job, say analysts. \u201cThe only way Ramaphosa stays is through a DA-ANC coalition.\u00a0Outside that,\u00a0the other parties, MK and EFF\u00a0(Economic Freedom Fighters), have made it clear the first point of negotiation is he must go,\u201d said TK Pooe, a senior lecturer at Wits School of Governance. If the ANC were to pair with the DA, which\u202freceived 21.8% of the vote, their combined support would amount to more than 60%, an outright majority. However, this relationship would require both parties to make some major compromises. While in government, the ANC\u2019s flagship policy for driving economic inclusion and racial equality in post-apartheid South Africa has been its Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment policy, known as triple-BEE or simply BEE. The\u202fBEE policy has been criticized\u202fby some as neither broad-based, nor empowering. In contrast, the DA has\u202fsaid\u202fit would replace BEE with an \u201cEconomic Justice Policy\u201d that \u201ctargets the poor black majority for redress, rather than a small, connected elite.\u201d The DA is also against the ANC\u2019s flagship National Health Insurance Act (NIH) in its current form. The act, which was signed into law two weeks before the election, seeks to provide universal health care for all and gradually limit the role of private health insurers. However, both parties believe in the primacy of South Africa\u2019s constitution and both have promised to crack down on corruption. Awkwardly, the DA is currently\u202fpressing corruption charges\u202fagainst the ANC\u2019s deputy president,\u00a0Paul Mashatile. In a move to appease internal critics, the ANC-DA coalition could be expanded to include smaller parties, or the ANC could form a minority government with a \u201cconfidence-and-supply\u201d agreement with opposition partners like the DA and the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), where they remain outside of government but support it on key votes in exchange for policy concessions. A bitter pill to swallow? If the ANC decides\u00a0to pursue coalition talks with MK, then Zuma will want Ramaphosa out, solidifying his revenge. However, if South Africa\u2019s president maintains his grip on the ANC, a coalition with MK is unlikely. The MK party\u2019s manifesto also\u00a0demands an overhaul of the country\u2019s constitution to restore more powers to traditional leaders. Zuma \u201cunapologetically focused his campaign around Zulu nationalism and that was a constituency that was easy for him to target,\u201d\u202fpolitical\u00a0analyst and former ANC\u00a0lawmaker\u00a0Melanie Verwoerd told CNN. By appealing to his Zulu base, Zuma\u2019s party has also stirred ethnic and tribal tensions, a strategy that, while electorally effective, risks deepening divisions in South Africa, Verwoerd added. The ANC\u2019s policies, grounded in the principles of non-racial and non-tribal governance, are at odds with this approach. It is also currently unclear how much MK actually wants to govern. Despite doing well at the polls, the party has demanded a re-run, threatened court action, and suggested boycotting the first sitting of Parliament. However,\u00a0it has provided no evidence of\u00a0voting\u00a0irregularities. The other option for a coalition is the EFF,\u00a0led by former ANC youth leader Julius Malema, who was expelled from the party more than a decade ago. The breakaway party espouses land expropriation without compensation and sweeping state nationalism, including nationalizing the Reserve Bank. Malema has said\u202fhe would give the EFF vote to the ANC on the condition that his deputy, Floyd Shivambu, becomes Minister of Finance in an effort to control fiscal policy. South Africa\u2019s business community and middle class are broadly nervous about an EFF\u2013ANC coalition and its effect on investor confidence. The DA calls it part of a\u00a0\u201cdoomsday\u201d option because of the potential impact on investment and trade. The EFF won just under 10% of the vote, so any coalition with the ANC would need to include at least another party in the mix to give it a healthy majority. The IFP, with almost 4% of the vote, could be such a kingmaker. Aside from a classic coalition deal or a \u201cconfidence and supply\u201d agreement, another hypothetical option on the table would be a \u201cgovernment of national unity\u201d (GNU), bringing in all the major parties. This scenario would hark back to the post-apartheid era when South Africa operated under a GNU to oversee the new constitution,\u00a0led by Mandela as president and FW de Klerk and Thabo Mbeki as deputy presidents,\u00a0between April 1994 and February 1997. With less than two weeks\u00a0to finalize coalition agreements, South Africa\u2019s political future remains uncertain; the ANC must navigate this complex landscape to form a stable government and address the challenges that have led to its diminished support, while Ramaphosa\u2019s leadership hangs in the balance amidst Zuma\u2019s dramatic comeback.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/africa/jacob-zuma-comeback-south-africa-elections-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_06_weather_california-heat-dome-west-record-climate", "text": "A searing heat dome will reach peak intensity Thursday afternoon and usher in the hottest day of the year so far for millions in the western US. Temperatures Thursday topped out up to 25 degrees above what\u2019s normal for the time of the year, making it feel like a hot July day in many locations. Heat will continue through the weekend before easing off a bit early next week. However, many typically hot areas in the West will still have to contend with temperatures up to 10 degrees above normal. A robust heat dome \u2013 a large area of high pressure that parks over an area, traps air and heats it with abundant sunshine for days or weeks \u2013 is driving this prolonged, unseasonable heat. TRACK IT: Where the heat will be hottest this week The temperatures will be dangerous for those exposed to the elements and unable to cool off.\u00a0Relief from the heat won\u2019t be found at night, either \u2013 another symptom of a world warming\u00a0due to fossil fuel pollution. Excessive heat warnings are in effect for more than 18 million people in California, Nevada, Arizona and Utah. A majority of these warnings, which are the most extreme form of heat alert issued by the National Weather Service, remain active through Friday. Heat has already taken its toll. Multiple people in different parts of the US have died due to heat-related illnesses since last weekend. Four migrants died \u201cfrom heat stroke and dehydration\u201d while triple digit temperatures baked the US-Mexico border last weekend, according to the US Border Patrol, El Paso Sector. In the East, a 59-year-old man died of heat-related complications in Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland, officials said Wednesday. Additional details about the man\u2019s death, which was the state\u2019s first heat-related death of the year, were not released. Heat also proved challenging for firefighters battling a blaze in California\u2019s Napa County Wednesday. Four firefighters were sent to area hospitals for injuries related to difficult terrain and \u201chot summer conditions,\u201d according to\u00a0CAL Fire\u2019s Sonoma-Lake-Napa Unit. All four are expected to make full recoveries. More than a dozen daily high temperature records fell earlier this week in the West as the heat dome strengthened. A few dozen more could be broken through the weekend. Flagstaff, Arizona; Reno, Nevada; and Fresno, California, are just a handful of cities where the day\u2019s high temperature record could fall on one or more days this week. Phoenix sizzled Wednesday but fell just short of its first 110-degree day of the year, a threshold it blew past Thursday as it soared to 113 degrees, also smashing the city\u2019s previous record for the day by 2 degrees. High temperatures hit 111 degrees in Las Vegas, tying this year with 2010 for the earliest such reading on record in the city. Death Valley, the hottest place in the world, clocked in with a temperature of 122 degrees, topping a daily record of 121 degrees it set back in 1996. Even the brutal desert landscape doesn\u2019t typically get this hot until mid-to-late June. Triple-digit temperatures will persist in California\u2019s Central Valley into the weekend with 110s sticking around in desert areas of California, Nevada and Arizona. Summerlike heat will expand northward Friday and reach the Northwest. Records could be broken in parts of Oregon, Washington and Idaho from Friday through the weekend. While it won\u2019t be record-breaking, Seattle will contend with high temperatures in the upper 70s Friday and could come close to 80 degrees on Saturday. Highs like these are 10 degrees warmer than what\u2019s typical for early June.

{"id": "2024_06_11_sport_robert-lewandowski-poland-euro-2024-spt-intl", "text": "Uruguay at the 1950 World Cup. Cameroon at the 1990 World Cup. Greece at Euro 2004. Just some of the shocks that have shaken the game to the core, written unheralded names into soccer folklore and generated stories that have been, and will continue to be, spoken about for generations to come. Could Poland produce an equally seismic surprise at Euro 2024? Even the most optimistic Poland fan, and for that matter soccer fan, would think this to be a pipe dream far beyond one\u2019s wildest imagination. Poland captain Robert Lewandowski, though, thinks otherwise. \u201cIn football, you never know. You have to believe and we have the hope,\u201d the country\u2019s iconic forward told CNN\u2019s Sport\u2019s Amanda Davies at the recent inaugural Globe Soccer Awards Europe Edition in Sardinia, Italy. \u201cIf we\u2019re playing as a team \u2026 really, we can achieve something. I don\u2019t know, what does it mean in the end but in football everything is possible.\u201d Seizing the moment For Poland, just to be at this summer\u2019s tournament can, to some extent, already be classified as an achievement. Lewandowski\u2019s side endured one of its worst qualifying campaigns in recent memory. Dispensing with head coach Fernando Santos and bringing in Micha\u0142 Probierz \u2013 Poland\u2019s fifth coach in three years \u2013 at the midway point following humiliating losses to Moldova and Albania, winning just three of eight qualifying games and ultimately failing to progress directly from a group in which it finished third. Poland was the last team to book its ticket to the finals after edging past Wales on penalties in the playoffs. Expectations, therefore, for Germany are low. And yet the \u2018free hit\u2019 mentality may well be just what the country needs to spring a surprise. With the backing of a large, vocal contingent of supporters who\u2019ll make the journey across the border, the prolific No. 9 said his team must be primed to seize its opportunity. \u201cAlways in the big tournaments some kind of teams can get troubles and you have to be ready to use the time you have [and] the opportunity to win the game and to get the points,\u201d he explained. \u201cWe are playing in Germany, the country is very close to Poland. So probably a lot of fans from Poland are coming to this tournament so we are very happy, and we try to enjoy every day to be there.\u201d Surprise Act How long that optimism will last remains to be seen. Poland has been drawn into arguably one of the toughest groups of the tournament, alongside two-time European champion France, the Netherlands and Austria \u2013 all ranked above them. Arguably, Poland\u2019s most realistic chance of making it through to the knockout rounds may well lie in trying to qualify as one of the best ranked third-placed teams. To add to the difficulty, Lewandowski will miss Poland\u2019s opening game of the tournament against the Netherlands on June 16 after suffering a muscle tear in his thigh picked up in the recent friendly win against Turkey. The country\u2019s FA say it will be doing everything possible to get him fit for the team\u2019s second game against Austria on June 21. But defying the odds is something the country has previous experience of in this tournament having reached the quarterfinals in 2016. Only a penalty shootout defeat  to eventual champion Portugal put pay to that Cinderella story. Lewandowski, though, is under no illusions of the task that awaits but said playing on the underdog status and leaning on past experiences could go a long way to determining Poland\u2019s fate in the competition. \u201cEven though we have a very tough group, we are ready,\u201d said the upbeat forward. \u201cI think we are playing good football [and] we know that we are not the favourites in the group stage. \u201cBut this is football \u2013 Sometimes one day, one game, 90 minutes\u2026 With the luck you can win something [\u2026] I am very positive in this month.\u201d Familiar territory The tournament will also have added significance for the 35-year-old. It was in Germany where Lewandowski rose to global prominence, spending 12 years playing for two of the powerhouse clubs in the country: Borussia Dortmund and then  Bayern Munich. At Dortmund, he collected Bundesliga titles. At Bayern, he was integral to its 2020 Champions League victory which formed part of a historic treble for the club. Named Bundesliga Player of the Season a record five times, he left Germany in 2022 as the league\u2019s second highest goalscorer of all time, only behind Gerd M\u00fcller\u2019s record of 365 goals. He\u2019ll return to Berlin \u2013 the scene of many a German domestic cup triumph \u2013 in Poland\u2019s second group game against Austria and then Dortmund for the team\u2019s group finale against Kylian Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s France. \u201cI know the people, I know the culture, I know almost everything, so I think that I am going to feel really, really well,\u201d he said, smiling. \u201cAnd very exciting as well to be playing again in these big stadiums, not only in Dortmund that I spent four years, but also [in] Berlin. \u201cThe atmosphere [in Berlin] I can say [is] similar [to] the Champions League final because the stadium and everything around is really beautiful.\u201d Could Germany also serve as the perfect swansong for his international career? This will be the sixth major tournament for Poland\u2019s all-time top scorer, but he insisted that retirement wasn\u2019t on his mind. \u201c[On retirement] I cannot say yes or no. It depends on many different things, many different options,\u201d he explained. \u201cPhysically, I\u2019m feeling very well. I don\u2019t see the difference, especially in this year than before. \u201cIf I feel something inside in my head, saying to me \u2018Okay, maybe it\u2019s time to say goodbye\u2019 then I know that the time is coming. But until now, I didn\u2019t feel this kind of feeling so it\u2019s still not this kind of way that I\u2019m thinking about this.\u201d Ukrainian Pride While Poland will be at the forefront of Lewandowski\u2019s mind, he\u2019ll also be keeping a close eye on Ukraine\u2019s progress at the tournament. The Pole has been a staunch ally of the embattled country and a long-time advocate for refugees since Russia launched its full-scale invasion on Ukraine in February 2022. Days after the invasion he lobbied for the postponement of Poland\u2019s international fixture against Russia and at the Qatar World Cup he wore the country\u2019s armband, which was presented to him ahead of the tournament by former captain and coach, Andriy Shevchenko. Despite narrowly missing out on a place in Qatar, Sergiy Rebrov\u2019s side sealed its place at the Euros with a dramatic come-from-behind victory against Iceland in a playoff final in March. Poland currently acts as home to nearly one million Ukrainians who have fled since February 2022, according to UN data. Ukraine begins its group stage campaign against Romania on June 17, before facing Slovakia and then Belgium. Lewandowski was confident that the team\u2019s appearance in Germany could give the country reason to be optimistic. \u201cThey were fighting [a] similar situation before the World Cup and they were so close and now they did it,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the difficult situation, if you\u2019ve got some kind of positive things like football that everyone around the world [is] speaking, thinking about the football, and if they see now this team on this kind of tournament, they can be proud. \u201cProbably, for sure, the people of Ukraine now cannot wait [for] the first game.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/sport/robert-lewandowski-poland-euro-2024-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "world"}}

Challenging times Many of the challenges facing the restaurant industry \u2014\u00a0and the wider culture \u2014\u00a0were addressed over the course of the evening: climate change, sustainability, inclusivity and mental health. A handful of honorees received achievement awards on Monday night. That group included legendary food writer, editor, novelist and television personality Ruth Reichl, who worked as a food critic at The New York Times and editor-in-chief of Gourmet Magazine and was honored for Lifetime Achievement. Reichl thanked the James Beard Foundation and the assembled food world luminaries for the transformation of American food culture that she\u2019s seen in her lifetime. \u201cYou changed the way we eat, created a delicious revolution and a world where people finally, finally understand that eating is an ethical act and that our food choices really matter. It gives me hope for the future,\u201d she said. Prior to the ceremony, which was livestreamed via website Eater, Reichl was asked on the event\u2019s red carpet about the origin of the term \u201cOscars of the food world.\u201d To her surprise, she was told that she coined it in her report from the very first awards more than three decades ago. The nonprofit James Beard Foundation was established in 1986, shortly after \u201cpioneer foodie\u201d James Beard\u2019s death, \u201cto celebrate, support and elevate the people behind America\u2019s food culture.\u201d The first awards ceremony was held in 1991. Beard was the host of \u201cI Love to Eat,\u201d the first food program on network television in 1946 and was called the \u201cDean of American Cookery\u201d by The New York Times in 1954. The foundation, which has faced controversy in recent years, in 2022 introduced new policies and procedures and a new code of ethics sparked by criticism about a lack of diversity and allegations of chefs\u2019 bad behavior. Last year, the process of vetting chef behavior led to its own controversy. Some of the night\u2019s winners expressed hopes that changes within the industry will continue to improve culinary culture. \u201cMy only hope as I stand here today is that we can continue as an industry to do the right thing. We can continue to seek diversity and inclusion and female-led teams as things that are extremely effective,\u201d said Gregory Gourdet, who won his third James Beard Award in three years on Monday, taking home the award for Best Chef: Pacific Northwest. Gourdet spoke of his move to Portland, Oregon, in 2008 from New York, leaving rehab early, \u201cbroken and miserable,\u201d and finding his purpose as a chef creating a hub for Haitian culture at his restaurant Kann. \u201cI hope that if we can slowly continue to do the right thing that the next generation has it a little bit better than we do, and the generation after that has it even better than they did. And we can just get rid of this generational trauma that\u2019s been affecting us and holding us hostage in our industry.\u201d Restaurant and Chef Awards (2024 finalists and winners Outstanding Restaurateur Hamissi Mamba and Nadia Nijimbere, Baobab Fare, Detroit, MI Quynh-Vy and Yenvy Pham, Ph\u1edf B\u1eafc S\u00fap Shop, Ph\u1edfcific Standard Time, and The Boat, Seattle, WA Chris Viaud, Greenleaf, Ansanm, and Pavilion, Milford and Wolfeboro, NH Hollis Wells Silverman, Eastern Point Collective (The Duck & The Peach, M\u00e9li, The Wells, and others), Washington, D.C.

There\u2019s the Art Deco curved crown of the Chrysler Building, the sweeping isosceles triangles that twist around One World Trade Center, the stepped limestone and granite rectangles of the Empire State Building and the triangular prism of the Flatiron Building. And now, a multi-billion-dollar tower featuring floor-to-ceiling glass will add another dimension to the cityscape, according to new details unveiled by New York City Mayor Eric Adams this week. Stretching up 62 stories, a planned office tower at 350 Park Avenue will provide space for more than 6,000 jobs, plus 1.8 million square feet of commercial office space, according to a press release. It will be funded by Vornado Realty Trust, Kenneth Griffin, founder and CEO of global investment firm Citadel, and building and management company Rudin. White columns will frame a new public concourse at the base of the new building on Park Avenue, complete with green space, seating and art displays, images show. Above, landscaped terraces will top each section of the glass-clad tower which will house the offices for Citadel and market making firm Citadel Securities. Adams hailed the project in the release, saying it will help \u201csupercharge our economy and expand New York City\u2019s iconic skyline,\u201d building on \u201ccontinued efforts to energize Midtown Manhattan as the world\u2019s most important business address and an economic engine for working-class New Yorkers.\u201d Architects Foster + Partners have designed the building, which will replace the existing 30-story tower currently at the site in Midtown Manhattan just a few blocks away from landmarks like the Rockefeller Center, St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral and Grand Central Station. As New York continues to deal with the economic aftershocks wrought by the Covid-19 pandemic, Adams and his administration said in their respective statements that they hoped this project would continue the city\u2019s recovery. \u201cThis investment opens a new chapter for Midtown \u2014 and closes the book on those who predicted its demise,\u201d said deputy mayor for operations Meera Joshi. \u201cMidtown\u2019s revitalization is being led by its public realm \u2014 including investments in Fifth Avenue, with the crown jewels of Central Park and Bryant Park at either end. Together, with our business improvement district and parks partners, we are reintroducing Fifth Avenue to the world and creating a vibrant live, work, play community for a new era,\u201d Joshi added. Building this new office space comes at a fraught time for the commercial real estate market as businesses struggle to entice workers back to the office after years of working from home. This has left vast tranches of office space vacant or underused, causing the value of such buildings to plummet at the same time as historically high interest rates have made it harder for real estate developers \u2014\u00a0who often take out huge loans to finance projects \u2014\u00a0to make good on their repayments. The project will begin the city\u2019s public review process early next year and the tower is expected to be completed by 2032, according to the release.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/20/style/park-avenue-skyscraper-new-york-skyline-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_09_europe_european-parliament-far-right-surge-intl", "text": "Far-right parties are predicted to win a record number of seats in the European Parliament, a result that, if confirmed, would deliver a stinging rebuke to Brussels\u2019 political mainstream and add uncertainty to Europe\u2019s future direction. After three days of voting across the European Union\u2019s 27 member states, an exit poll showed that far-right parties were set to win around 150 of the parliament\u2019s 720 seats, which will likely make it harder for mainstream parties to form majorities needed to pass laws. In a speech late Sunday, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the results showed her European People\u2019s Party (EPP) \u2013 predicted to secure the most seats \u2013 could still act as an \u201canchor of stability,\u201d but called on her political allies to help guard against extremist parties. \u201cThe center is holding. But it is also true that the extremes on the left and on the right have gained support, and this is why the result comes with great responsibility for the parties in the center,\u201d she told an audience in Brussels. The full results will trickle in on Monday, when the process of coalition-building will begin as Europe\u2019s centrists seek to put aside their differences to see off a resurgent far right. Most of the far-right gains were concentrated in countries that elect large numbers of seats: France, Italy and Germany. After an exit poll showed Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Rally (RN) party is expected to trounce his own candidates, French President Emmanuel Macron dissolved his parliament and called a risky snap election, with the first round on June 30. RN won 36.8% of the vote, according to official results from the French Interior Ministry on Monday, followed by Macron\u2019s pro-European list on 14.6% and the center-left Socialist Party with 13.8%. In a celebratory speech at the RN headquarters before Macron\u2019s shock announcement, party leader Jordan Bardella said the \u201cunprecedented defeat for the current government marks the end of a cycle, and Day 1 of the post-Macron era.\u201d Like Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz also suffered a stinging blow in the exit poll, as his Social Democrats (SD) scored their worst-ever result of 14%, while the mainstream Christian Democrats Party (CDU) came top with 29.5% of the vote and the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) came second with 16.5%. While the results will shape the political direction of the EU for the next five years, this cluster of national elections is often seen as a de facto referendum on the incumbent domestic governments, which could spell trouble for Macron in France\u2019s 2027 presidential election and for Scholz in Germany\u2019s federal elections next year. A lot has changed in Europe since the last parliamentary elections in 2019, after Britain left the bloc in 2020 and Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, putting much of the continent on a war footing as it sought to send desperately needed supplies to Kyiv and member states shored up their own defenses. \u201cOf course, this election does not take place in a vacuum. The world around us is in turmoil. Forces from the outside and from the inside are trying to destabilize our societies, and they are trying to weaken Europe,\u201d von der Leyen said. While the far-right surge may further complicate Brussels\u2019 bid for unity, the far-right parties themselves remain relatively divided. The AfD is politically homeless: it was removed from the far-right Identity and Democracy (ID) party after its main European candidate, Maximilian Krah, said he did not consider all members of the Nazi group the SS to be criminals. Several other far-right parties are among the non-aligned (NI) group, predicted to secure 45 seats. Responding to the exit poll, Roberta Metsola, president of the European Parliament, said the results showed Brussels\u2019 political establishment needed to \u201cunderstand how people voted\u201d and take decisions \u201cthat have an impact on citizens\u2019 daily lives.\u201d \u201cWe can see that the constructive, pro-European center has held,\u201d she said, but stressed there remains \u201ca responsibility of the groups to come together to form a majority.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/09/europe/european-parliament-far-right-surge-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_10_style_photographer-juergen-teller-the-myth", "text": "After having sex, some women hoping to get pregnant will immediately raise their legs up high, for a few minutes or longer, in the hope that gravity will assist conception. Though the impact of such contortion is not actually grounded in science, it persists as a familiar trope in movies and TV, and has long been passed down generationally as fertility lore. So when photographer Juergen Teller and his wife and creative partner Dovile Drizyte were trying for a baby while on vacation in Sicily two years ago, Teller recommended the practise. \u201cI said to Dovile, \u2018It\u2019s a better chance to get pregnant afterwards, if you put your legs up,\u2019\u201d he recalled in a joint video interview with CNN. With another couple, the suggestion might have just resulted in a quick Google search and a laugh over the old wives\u2019 tale. But for Teller and Drizyte, who have had a fruitful artistic collaboration for the past few years \u2014 including, recently, their now 1-year-old daughter Iggy recreating her dad\u2019s most famous fashion shoots \u2014 the exchange led to a tongue-in-cheek body of work. Now a published book, \u201cThe Myth\u201d is a portrait series featuring a nude Drizyte set against the 94 rooms of the neoclassical and art deco Grand Hotel Villa Serbelloni in Lake Como, Italy. Against damask wallpaper, ornate gold bedframes and plush chaise longues, Drizyte\u2019s legs rise in every photograph. She splays out on beds and floors, balances herself on small chairs, and overlooks the picturesque views of the mountainous region from atop a balcony table, all with her feet hovering in midair. As they explored the villa, they were delighted to find symbols of fertility, femininity and motherhood in the hotel\u2019s art collection. From Madonna and Child icons to baptismal scenes to sensual nude drawings, the works became a throughline in the \u201cThe Myth.\u201d \u201cIt was a very interesting surprise \u2014 it seemed like the hotel was helping us with the project,\u201d Drizyte said. What lies ahead In each frame Drizyte is seemingly post-coital, though she noted that it was important for none of the poses to look sexualized. \u201cIt was more (about) waiting for the baby,\u201d she explained of the compositions. \u201cWhat is coming? What is approaching? \u2026Of course, there\u2019s a bit of humor because you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen; your life really changes.\u201d \u201cDovile had to be very serene,\u201d Teller added, emphasizing how mentally \u2014 and for Drizyte, physically \u2014 exhausting the five-day shoot was as they entered each hotel room to decide on a new variation of the scene. By the time they had arranged the shoot with the hotel, Drizyte was already pregnant \u2014 and starting to show, adding \u201ca bit of time pressure\u201d to the project, she said. Teller had previously stayed in the villa, even photographing a 2019 campaign for YSL there (also with a focus on legs, albeit in sheer hosiery), and the owners enthusiastically gave them free rein as staff prepared to close for the off-season, the photographer explained. \u201cWe became a part of the hotel going into hibernation,\u201d Drizyte recalled. \u201cThe maids were coming and cleaning these rooms and taking beds out.\u201d \u201cGuests disappeared and it became more ghostlike,\u201d Teller added. \u201cIt was wonderful, romantic and beautiful.\u201d He added that the experience helped them concentrate and think about what laid ahead for them as parents. Despite the fact that becoming pregnant was straightforward for Drizyte,\u00a0she emphasized how much of it is luck. \u201cIt\u2019s like a lottery, almost, whether it\u2019s all quick and easy, or it takes longer, or there are complications,\u201d she said. \u201cYou start really believing and asking or praying or contemplating\u2026 (or putting) your legs up \u2014 surely that helps?\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/style/photographer-juergen-teller-the-myth/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_10_europe_european-elections-explainer-intl", "text": "Results are being announced in the\u00a0European\u00a0parliamentary elections \u2013 one of the world\u2019s biggest democratic exercises \u2013 and a few clear narratives have emerged from the days-long poll. Far-right parties across the continent had strong showings, but their momentum did not cause the center ground of European politics to cave in \u2013 as many had predicted. Instead, liberal and Green groups lost seats and relevance in the European Parliament. Meanwhile, domestic politics was upended in some countries, including France \u2013 where new elections were announced. Here\u2019s what you need to know. Far right makes gains Ahead of the vote, eyes across Europe were fixed mainly on the continent\u2019s far-right parties \u2013 with gains by those groups expected to form a major part of Sunday\u2019s narrative. Those gains did materialize; far-right groups were expected to secure a record number of seats in the European Parliament, dealing a major blow to the continent\u2019s establishment leaders. Far-right parties were set to win around 150 of the parliament\u2019s 720 seats, an exit poll projected, potentially frustrating efforts by mainstream parties to form majorities needed to pass laws. Most of the far-right gains were concentrated in countries that elect large numbers of seats: France, Italy and Germany. But the parties must still work to build a consensus if they are to maximize their political threat. Germany\u2019s AfD is politically homeless: it was removed from the far-right Identity and Democracy (ID) party after its main European candidate, Maximilian Krah, said he did not consider all members of the Nazi group, the SS, to be criminals. Several other far-right parties are among the non-aligned (NI) group, predicted to secure 45 seats. The center holds Despite a far-right surge, the centrist European People\u2019s Party (EPP) was the biggest single winner on Sunday night. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a speech late on Sunday that the group \u2013 predicted to secure the most seats \u2013 could still act as an \u201canchor of stability.\u201d But she called on her political allies to help guard against extremist parties. \u201cThe center is holding. But it is also true that the extremes on the left and on the right have gained support, and this is why the result comes with great responsibility for the parties in the center,\u201d she told an audience in Brussels. Von der Leyen appeared to rule out any possibility of the party banding together with the far-right factions, telling journalists that she will be reaching out to The Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D) and centrist and liberal Renew Europe to form a \u201cbroad majority for a strong Europe.\u201d Von der Leyen, who is seeking a second term as European Commission president, outlined her desire to keep pushing on with parties who are \u201cpro-European, pro-Ukraine, pro-rule-of-law.\u201d National politics in disarray The results massively disrupted politics in several European countries, as gains from previously fringe groups became impossible for some leaders to ignore. French President Emmanuel Macron called a stunning snap election on Sunday after his party was trounced by Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Rally (RN). \u201cI have decided to give you back the choice of your parliamentary future by voting. I am therefore dissolving the National Assembly this evening,\u201d Macron said. The elections to pick a new parliament will take place on 30 June and 7 July. France\u2019s main far-right electoral lists in the European Elections took more than one in three votes cast, according to official results from the French Interior Ministry Monday. France returns \u2013 the European elections list for Marine Le Pen\u2019s RN party \u2013 and the list headed by her niece Marion Mar\u00e9chal won 36.83% of votes cast, more than the next three parties combined. In a celebratory speech at the RN headquarters before Macron\u2019s shock announcement, party leader Jordan Bardella said the \u201cunprecedented defeat for the current government marks the end of a cycle, and Day 1 of the post-Macron era.\u201d Belgium\u2019s Prime Minister Alexander De Croo meanwhile resigned after his party suffered a disastrous defeat in national and European parliamentary elections. The 48-year-old politician struggled to hold back his tears when announcing the decision on Sunday evening in Brussels. \u201cI was the figurehead of this campaign. This is not the result I had hoped for, and I, therefore, take responsibility for this result. It was not meant to be,\u201d De Croo told journalists. Meloni and Tusk have good nights Few major EU leaders enjoyed results night, but Italy\u2019s Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni saw her party make gains, and ended the process as a major player in European politics. Her domestic party, Brothers of Italy, was the most rightwing to be elected to government in Italy since that of Benito Mussolini, the wartime fascist leader. But Meloni has proven a pragmatic figure in Europe, becoming an ally of von der Leyen, and a staunch supporter of Ukraine, while pushing the bloc to take a firmer stance on migration. Those efforts could accelerate after Brothers of Italy won the country\u2019s vote. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Donald Tusk\u2019s efforts to make Poland a force in Brussels were boosted after his party held off the populist opposition Law and Justice (PiS) group to secure an outright victory. Tusk has rebuilt Warsaw\u2019s reputation at the European table after defeating PiS in a national election last October. The former European Council President made reintegration with Europe a key pillar of his campaign and his time in office, while the strategic significance of Poland to the bloc has increased following Russia\u2019s invasion of neighboring Ukraine. Brussels\u2019 mainstream leaders will also be relieved that Hungary\u2019s authoritarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, for so long a thorn in the EU\u2019s side, was dealt a blow on Sunday. His party Fidesz suffered its worst European election results to date, ceding ground to its center-right opponents. Greens fall back As fringe parties on the right made gains, left-wing groups, and in particular the Greens, were squeezed across Europe. Early results showed that Green support in France and Germany suffered especially huge drops in seats. \u201cThe losses in Germany and France are obviously a blow,\u201d Bas Eickhout, the Greens/EFA vice-president and lead candidate of the European Green Party, admitted in a statement as results came in. The group insisted they would work to push the new parliament to prioritize work on the climate, but their standing is severely diminished and it remains to be seen how much Europe\u2019s leaders will need to rely on their support. The European Commission announced one of the world\u2019s most ambitious goals to slash planet-heating pollution in February, but faces opposition in rural areas around the continent, with farmers\u2019 unions saying the plans represent a threat to their livelihoods.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/europe/european-elections-explainer-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_europe_emaciated-ukrainian-pow-intl", "text": "Roman Gorilyk is now little more than a skeleton. His ribs and collarbones are sticking out, his belly is sunken, his shoulder and hip joints clearly visible under his pale skin. Gorilyk\u2019s extreme emaciation appears to be the result of the two years he spent in Russian captivity. The former checkpoint guard at the Chernobyl nuclear plant in northern Ukraine was detained by Russian troops in March 2022, shortly after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. He was finally released on Friday, one of 75 Ukrainians exchanged for 75 Russian prisoners of war. The Ukrainian authorities released several photographs of Gorilyk, 40, on Wednesday to show the toll they say Russian captivity has taken on him. \u201cThe condition of Roman and other Ukrainian prisoners of war evokes horror and associations with the darkest pages of human history \u2013 Nazi concentration death camps,\u201d the Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War, a Ukrainian government body, said in a statement posted on Telegram alongside the photos. The National Guard of Ukraine told CNN that almost all of the released prisoners have suffered weight loss, sores and lesions and chronic conditions stemming from untreated injuries. Ukrainian presidential adviser\u00a0Mykhailo Podolyak said the prisoners returned to Ukraine in a \u201chorrifying\u201d state. \u201cThe torture by starvation is monstrous, the beatings and violence are sophisticated,\u201d he said in a statement posted on X, accusing Russia of ignoring international human rights agreements. \u201cThere are no Geneva Conventions anymore\u2026 Russia again thinks it can avoid being held accountable for massive war crimes,\u201d he said. CNN has asked the Russian Ministry of Defense for comment. Under the Geneva Conventions, the set of international laws that regulate armed conflict, prisoners of war must be treated humanely and with dignity, and must be provided with basic daily food rations that are \u201csufficient in quantity, quality and variety to keep prisoners of war in good health and to prevent loss of weight or the development of nutritional deficiencies.\u201d The Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War said Gorilyk was among 169 guards who were taken by the invading Russian forces and transported to Russia via Belarus.

{"id": "2024_06_10_europe_france-macron-gamble-far-right-vote-intl-cmd", "text": "It was a stinging blow and a shocking parry. French President Emmanuel Macron saw his party fall into second place in European Parliament elections in France on Sunday, with the two main far-right parties together taking close to 40% of the vote. When Jordan Bardella, the leader of the far-right National Rally party, called on Macron\ufeff to dissolve the French national parliament on Sunday night, it seemed like political posturing, riding high on his victory in European polls. \u201cThe President of the Republic cannot remain deaf to the message sent by the French this evening,\u201d he told supporters. Macron called his bluff. Announcing a snap national election for the end of June, Macron has set up a showdown between his pro-European, centrist and pro-Ukrainian ideals and the anti-immigration, populist and hard-line law-and-order rhetoric of the far right. \u201cThe extreme right is both the impoverishment of the French and the downgrading of our country. So, at the end of this day, I cannot act as if nothing had happened,\u201d he told the country in a televised address Sunday. Calling the far right\u2019s bluff Macron will try to rally the right and left, urging their supporters to come together and vote against the far right, but there\u2019s no knowing if it\u2019ll pay off. The first round of voting will take place in 20 days, a tiny window in which to form a coalition from the mosaic of France\u2019s centrist and left-wing parties. There appears to be little appetite to join forces with Macron on the left, bruised after years of largely fruitless protests against his pro-business agenda, and torn apart from the inside by divisions over the war in Gaza. The last time a French president dissolved the country\u2019s lower house, the National Assembly, was in 1997. Jacques Chirac lost his majority, and the left came to power. In an interview Monday morning, French Foreign Minister Stephane S\u00e9journ\u00e9 said that Macron\u2019s Renaissance party was open to withholding candidates from contesting the seats of potential allies in other parties. S\u00e9journ\u00e9 told Radio France that the party would discuss such a move with \u201creasonable people with whom we can work.\u201d On Sunday night, the popular French far-left party France Unbowed (LFI) appeared to have already ruled itself out of such a move. \u201cIt is now clear that the country wants to turn the page on the Macron era. And this page must not be turned with the National Rally and the far right,\u201d Manon Aubry, leader of the LFI European list, which came fourth in the European vote in France, told supporters. LFI figurehead Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon said that he saw no reason to unite with other parties on the left, especially with the narrow window to form a coalition. Such a proposition by Macron\u2019s party is no doubt a sign of weakness, a far cry from Macron\u2019s 2017 landslide second-round victory over far-right presidential candidate Marine Le Pen \u2013 and a sign of the times, his party wounded by memories of the \u201cyellow vest\u201d protests, an unyielding Covid-19 regime, and unpopular pension reforms. Since parliamentary elections held at the beginning of his second term in 2022, Macron has been ruling without an absolute majority in parliament, ordinarily unable to pass bills with his lawmakers alone. Instead, he invoked article 49.3 of the constitution several times to push legislation through parliament without a vote. This has stoked yet more anger against Macron and further division in France, especially given the contentious nature of his hike in the pension age to 64. Dueling visions The far-right National Rally, spearheaded by Le Pen, the long-time doyenne of France\u2019s anti-immigration camp, currently holds 88 to Macron\u2019s bloc\u2019s 250 seats in the 577-seat French parliament and, in theory, the upcoming election is far from a two-horse race. The appeal of the far-right\u2019s anti-immigration stance is no doubt magnified on the European stage \u2013 where EU lawmakers have long struggled to stem illegal immigration flows. At a national level, Bardella and Le Pen will have to rely on a broader spectrum of policies, doing battle with Macron\u2019s economic record, which has mostly shielded France from the inflation woes suffered by Europe. However, it\u2019s clear that this election will be a duel between Macron and Le Pen. French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire admitted Monday morning that his party held some responsibility for Sunday\u2019s results. He made his objective for the campaign clear. \u201cThis will be project against project; National Rally against ours,\u201d he told French radio network RTL. The French foreign minister described the call for elections as a \u201cbet of confidence\u201d in the French people by Macron, with the president trusting they will hold the line against political extremes. France\u2019s voting system plays in Macron\u2019s favor. In the first round of ballots, a variety of parties will compete to meet a minimum threshold of votes. The second round on July 7 will see the highest-polling candidates in each seat run off if no one wins an absolute majority. This could see voters of different stripes banding together to oppose a candidate from the far right. This mechanism also applies to the presidential election, which has ensured no far-right victory at the Elysee Palace thus far. On a more local scale, it may not be such a security. Ultimately, the June 30 and July 7 votes will determine how Macron spends his last three years in power. What comes next? What\u2019s certain is that Macron \u2013 with a presidential mandate until 2027 - will remain president no matter what. If his gamble pays off and he wins back a majority in parliament, he\u2019ll be able to move ahead with reforms and govern as he likes: changes to end-of-life care and the education system are in his crosshairs. It\u2019ll give him precious breathing space and a clear mandate for his agenda at home and abroad. In his words, \u201cIt\u2019s a time of indispensable clarification.\u201d \u201cThe rise of nationalists and demagogues is a danger not only for our nation, but also for our Europe and for France\u2019s place in Europe and the world,\u201d Macron said Sunday in his address to the nation. But the prospect of a lame-duck presidency looms large. If his bloc, currently with 250 of the 577 MPs in the National Assembly, fails to meet the 289-seat threshold for an absolute majority but remains the largest, his government will again have to wage legislative battle with one hand tied behind its back. If his nightmare comes true and the far-right movement replicates its European results on the national stage, he will be forced to appoint a prime minister from its ranks \u2013 most likely the 28-year-old Bardella, current president of National Rally. In a \u201ccohabitation,\u201d Macron would deal with international and defense issues, while Bardella would hold sway over the domestic agenda. Party figurehead Le Pen would likely wait in the wings to contest the 2027 president election against Macron\u2019s successor. The constitution prevents him running for a third term. \u201cWe are ready to be in power,\u201d she said in her Sunday night victory speech. In a country increasingly polarized by populist rhetoric, Ya\u00ebl Braun-Pivet, speaker of France\u2019s National Assembly struck a lonely note Monday morning as she called for greater cross-party cooperation. \u201cIn France we don\u2019t manage to get past partisan quarrels,\u201d she said in an interview with broadcaster France 2. Macron\u2019s reputation has been founded on bold, political moves. But if he fails to hold back the far-right this month in the coming weeks, his legacy will be the gamble that let the far right into power.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/europe/france-macron-gamble-far-right-vote-intl-cmd/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "world"}}
